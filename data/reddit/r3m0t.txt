You agreed to let them mix the coins you deposited, even though that would mean some of *your* coins would be given to miners as transaction fees. Sure, Mt Gox would be expected to maintain the balance by adding some of their own coins, but the fact remains you gave them permission to transfer your coins to other people.
You also agreed to let them move the coins to a cold wallet, even though that means it could delay your withdrawal by several hours if the hot wallet is emptied.

No shit, I never claimed otherwise.


I'm arguing that "didn't cause any distress" is not a reason to have something be legal. The fact that the silent unseen gun could harm people when shot into a crowd is a sufficient reason for outlawing the action of shooting it into crowds.


That isn't a reason to give up all risk assessment. Besides, the billions spent on counterterrorism are more because of [bad guy bias]( than an actual misestimation of risks.


Isn't it obvious that we value human lives? If you don't value a human life, why should murder be illegal?


Killing is wrong, I do not include any happiness from wrongdoing in my calculations. If, however, your mine-planting actually serves a purpose beyond killing me, then maybe you have a case. After all, cars cause accidents, but I am perfectly happy to allow cars onto the road.

Didn't the court already hear an unrealistic rehabilitation proposal? I don't understand why you would want that. It would be more expensive which means more company funds being spent rather than being given to customers. And it would fail, guaranteed.
The Mt Gox software sucks, their customer service sucked, their regulatory compliance sucked (causing USD withdrawals to be delayed indefinitely. Exactly what you want in an exchange, right?) and now the brand sucks too. Their bank is sick of them as well if rumours are to be believed. There's nothing left to rehabilitate.

Mark already disabled USD withdrawals for over 6 months with no legal consequences, so anybody who thought that BTC withdrawals would *necessarily* be re-enabled within 6 months was, well, an idiot.

This wouldn't defend against malware at all. If the malware is running while your wallet is open, it can take your wallet.
For example, if it installs, it can wait until you open your wallet app and then take screenshots of your file selection dialogs.
It can replace your wallet software with one that collects your private key.
A big con I see is the chance of the file being unintentionally modified. It could be caused by software like Picasa or iTunes. It is up to the user to make sure they have backups and are prepared, and if this sub has taught you anything, it should be that users make mistakes and have accidents. The chances of somebody remembering while organising their photos that random photo x "contains" 0.1 BTC is pretty small.

**When has Mark ever said that fiat cash was stolen from Mt Gox?**
What are these supposed corporate debts? Unpaid wages, rent, what?
Under liquidation people who had cash are treated the same as people with Bitcoins. The Bitcoins are liquidated and mixed with the cash and everybody gets a share in proportion to how much money they had deposited on Mt Gox. If they had 1 bitcoin and it's worth $500 they would get twice as much as somebody who had $250. Pretty simple.

Who are the victims then, if nobody notices the gun?




No fear, ergo no victims? That's the only way I can read your earlier post.


False dichotomy, deaths are a harm (moral view). A chance of death is a chance of harm, which is bad.


So am I supposed to believe that you check all the roads on your route are empty before you drive drunk? Maybe you instantly sober up if you realise there are other road users? Or does your car shut down if there are pedestrians nearby?




Again, morality and statistics can work together.


If you don't like it don't drive. That's your right.
Personally I, unlike SCOTUS, don't think forced blood tests should ever be accepted, but if there was a law automatically revoking your driver's license for refusing to take one, that would be acceptable. As long as the police drove you home after.


It's fairer to punish every drunk driver instead of attempting to give leeway to individual reasons about visibility, business of the road, etc.


Because of my right to privacy and family life. Forgive me for thinking that a number representing the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream is not a private detail akin to what somebody does in their own home. Anyway, this is getting further from the original question, which IIRC, is should DUI be illegal.


There is no such thing. State-sanctioned execution is abhorrent. Life imprisonment is acceptable, but should be done in a fair process, not "somebody who took a course in planting bombs".


Would you benefit from the ability to DUI legally that much? I mean, *really*?

I disagree. When you deposit money in a bank, you no longer own that money. The bank owns it, and can lend it out to others. You only own a debt from the bank of the amount you gave them.
I don't see why this would be any different. Sending bitcoins to Mt Gox means giving up ownership of those coins. They're free to mix them and do whatever. You only own a debt from Mt Gox at that point.
In any case since most of the coins are gone it would be impossible to return coins to their "original" customers. And since Bitcoins are meant to be fungible it would make no sense too.

This again? You were dodging basic questions in the previous thread about the "savegox" plan, but you're still promoting it with misleading statements.
SaveGox wants to use customer deposits to build a new exchange platform. Either customer Bitcoins or customer fiat currrencies. [source](
Misleading claims: the Japanese judges don't consider the Bitcoins to be worth anything, and the liquidator won't investigate the missing coins. They promised to do so here: [2014-04-24 announcement, page 5](
Unanswered question: why the legal advice you supposedly received contradicts basic law and makes no sense. [more](
This is an attempt to grab deposits, plain and simple. THERE IS NOTHING ELSE IN MT GOX ASSETS THE "NEW OWNERS" COULD POSSIBLY WANT. No personnel, no software, no brand name, nothing. They want to either earn interest on deposits while their "repayment plan" very slowly "makes it whole", or they just want to claim they own the coins.

That is how bankruptcy is often done in Japan, apparently. So the shares would be normal shares legally recognised as such in Japan, not Master/Goxcoins.
What this post is about is that Mt Gox's initial bankruptcy filing doesn't treat users' BTC balances as a liability, just their USD/other currency balances. That may change in future, with the court deciding a conversion rate for the BTC so that BTC account holders can be recompensed. Or it might not, nobody really knows yet.
OP's post basically assumes that Mt Gox will want to repay people's BTC balances, *and* that their suggested way will be accepted by the court, which at this stage it's far too early to know about.

You are committing a fallacy when you say it's unprofitable to sell coins at below the value you bought them at. The loss is made when the value of the coins drops, not when the coins are sold. On top of that, you are assuming they believe the coins will always "correct" upwards, and this is not guaranteed.
Bitcoiners might sell for any number of reasons, for example if their salary drops  or the price of Bitcoin rises they might sell because too much of their wealth is now in Bitcoin and they need the security of holding a non-volatile asset like a savings account. They might sell because they aren't interested in trading Bitcoins any more, and prefer a different asset.

Even if the court accepted your argument, all that would happen is they would follow the transaction history of your coins and any addresses that gox still had the private key to, they would send those coins to you. You'd still get the same amount on average but it would be more random (instead of everybody getting 15% of what they put in, some people would get 100% and some 0%).

For a small fee paid in BTC, you could buy the ability to send Fuiella a certain amount of cash (deposited at a local bank) once and have it sent to you as BTC.
So it went like this:
Druggie paid BTC fee to Fuiella.
Fuiella places order at BitInstant using a disposable email address and revealing nothing about himself.
BitInstant sends Fuiella bank details.
Fuiella sends druggie bank details.
Druggie deposits money at bank.
Mysterious payment processor, who owns the bank account, tells BitInstant the money is received. (They'll send that money in good time.)
BitInstant deducts fee, releases BTC to Fuiella.
Fuiella deducts fee, forwards BTC to druggie.
So Fuiella and BitInstant were breaking the law, Fuiella due to money laundering and BitInstant due to letting it happen under their noses. Mysterious payment processor apparently wasn't involved enough to be charged. Druggie isn't breaking the law until they use the BTC to buy drugs.

If the money is only accepted by one company and on exchanges, it's really risky to work for that company. Say you are hired by Nintendo as a developer, they pay you in Nintendo dollars. You have to be certain that the Wii U will take off. If it doesn't, nobody will want your Nintendo dollars and your pay will be worthless. Nintendo would have to increase your nominal pay (i.e. print more of their currency because it's becoming less value... that's a recipe for disaster) or start paying using an ordinary currency.

@_date: 2014-04-27 13:34:15
OK, then where is the customer money on the balance sheet? Why isn't it mentioned anywhere? Isn't it relevant and we would expect it to be mentioned, considering the whole problem is Mt Gox is holding less "customer money" than customers' accounts are supposed to contain?
Are you saying Mt Gox has another 55 million USD of liabilities *apart from* customer account deposits? That's impossible. There's no way their office charges that much rent. There's no way they have 55 million USD of unpaid wages outstanding.
So maybe you are claiming that the 55 million USD of liabilities is customer money, and the 22 million USD of assets are corporate money. Even though they are listed on the same row.
Even if it was corporate money - which it isn't - then it should be paid back to customers now, since the customer fund accounts don't cover the customer balances. Instead you are proposing that:
1. Somebody from KnCMiner and some other businessmen get to spend 8 million USD of Mt Gox assets building a new exchange,
2. They repay the Bitcoins after one year (page 27), but USD, JPY balances are only repaid as and when money comes in,
3. After paying back all the original money, they get to own the exchange that they spent 8 million USD of Mt Gox holdings to build.
So while in a normal bankruptcy, corporate money would be dished out to creditors (that means Mt Gox account holders) immediately, in *this* restructuring you're suggesting the money is used to build a new profitable business, which other people get to keep.
You are still dodging and obfuscating constantly and it's ridiculous.

Plea bargains don't really happen here in the UK.
I don't know how much the justice system costs comparatively in each country but IMO if the government isn't willing to pay for a fair trial, it isn't worth throwing the person in prison. In the US the deck is stacked against you because the prosecutor can say, "you face ten years.. but agree to forgo a trial and we'll make it 3 months". Even if you're innocent and think you might be able to prove it, who would take that chance? Result: innocent people going to jail so that they don't risk going to jail for even longer. But they still suffer after the 3 months in terms of their criminal record, etc.
And if you don't believe it's unfairly coercive, just look at Aaron Swartz. He rejected a plea deal of 3 months and was threatened with 20 years. I don't want to simplify the causes of his suicide, but I feel that must be part of it.

Not arguing any morality here, just hoping to explain the illegality.


UC-1 told Faiella he wanted $5,000 of BTC to buy some cocaine, this was conveniently both over the legal limit for such transactions to take place without KYC (know your customer, ie customer shows ID) *and* showed that it was for an illegal purpose. Faiella went ahead and did the transaction anyway. This explicit acceptance plus the circumstantial evidence - the way he marketed it etc - will almost certainly result in a conviction.




Money laundering means to hide the *source* of money. And specifically anybody who sells one kind of currency for another, or takes currency from one person but sends it to another person, have to follow laws about being registered as an MSB, reporting suspicious transactions, reporting transactions over a certain amount etc.
The users of the service aren't breaking any laws when they perform large transactions, and it isn't illegal to buy bitcoins with the intent of purchasing drugs. (Only the actual purchase of the drugs is illegal.) However the *provider* of the service is still doing something illegal if they know it's for drugs or they don't follow the right rules.
Same as how it's illegal to sell alcohol or cigarettes to a minor, but not illegal for the minor to buy alcohol (afaik).


He wasn't doing that.


Again, UC-1 proved it was about drugs to some extent. Besides, Faiella *only* sold Bitcoins on Silk Road (AFAICT), and almost all the categories in Silk Road and all the promotions of Silk Road were drug-oriented.

If the credit union was just selling BTC, then sure they can do that. At that point, they don't really need to partner with you. At the most, you would be a broker like Coinbase, not a proper exchange.
If the credit union was letting you deposit USD into your exchange account which you can then trade at a later time - that's basically transmitting money into an unregulated account run by another company. If that company lets its customers, err, transfer USD between one another, or withdraw BTC from their accounts, they are a money transmitter and need to be licensed. They can't lean on the credit union's license.

You're right, they are just concerned with you getting your money back.
When I put my money in a bank, I won't lose it if it goes under.
When I buy a return plane ticket, I am insured against my airline or travel agency going under. They will always pay for me to be brought back home.
When I give my landlord a rental deposit, I will get that money back, even if my landlord or agent declares bankruptcy.
I don't care about the details, what matters is the outcome.
A government regulator would require the Bitcoins in an exchange account to be held under a wallet in the owner's name, not Mt Gox. If Mt Gox was taking any money to authorise re-sending somebody money because of transaction malleability, it would actually show up as a withdrawal from your account. If they were doing that, at least you would know. And if they weren't doing that, you would be able to withdraw your bitcoins, since they would be in a web wallet separate from the Mt Gox company.
And a government regulator would never allow a company to continue running its market and *accepting deposits* while it was unable or refusing to perform withdrawals.
"greasing someone's palms"? Government regulators have nothing to gain from any regulatory fees. They don't get any commission - it all goes to the government in general. A group of 4 million employees none of whom own any shares in the government.

An option is a contract which is basically a bet. Technically speaking, you pay the writer a little bit of money *now* in order to have the *option* to buy something at a certain time in the future at a price fixed today.
For example I can buy a call option, which could be an option to buy 5 kg of carrots on the 1st of August for $2/kg. If the price of carrots on that day is $1.90/kg, then I will buy it at the normal market price, and I will have lost the money I spent on the call option. If the price is $3/kg, then I can "exercise" the option by buying 5kg of carrots for $2/kg. Then I can immediately sell the carrots for $3/kg and earn $5.
Here $2/kg is the "strike" and 1st of August is the "close". The person I'm buying the option from is said to "write" the option. The option is a "call" option because I get to buy 5kg of carrots instead of sell 5kg of carrots.
Because all options have similar terms, buyers and writers can be matched up with an automatic marketplace like this website.
A future is like an option, but it binds both sides: it's like an option which you're obliged to use, even if it would be more profitable not to exercise it.
Options and futures can be useful to many businesses who know that they will need to buy something at a set date, but they're also used by traders. (A future for carrots is basically a piece of paper which increases and decreases in price like carrots, but doesn't require refrigeration).

Your mistake seems to be in the phrase "bitcoin node". All that you said is true, but you don't need to be a bitcoin node to send and receive bitcoins; you just need to be in communication with one.
In the future the block chain (currently 300 MB) will be, say, 200 GB and stored on a server which I purchase an account on. I will be able to run queries, say, "which transactions have 1KSDXrsgiQ5mdd7Cg9MMQRnzNgiFm4BiAf as a destination address?" and it will send me all the transactions. (Or all the confirmed transactions, or all the transactions in the last month, or whatever.) Then if I own 1KSD... then my device (say a mobile phone) has the private key. I can then sign a transaction and send it to the server, saying "I've just created a transaction sending money, could you get it onto the bitcoin network?". 10 minutes later, the server sends a reply saying "Me, or somebody else, has mined your transaction into a block and your transaction has now been accepted on the bitcoin network".
But my device never has to store a *full* history and receive information about *all* new transactions.
I would pay a tiny amount for this service: I might get it free from my mobile provider, Google could provide it for free, or I could pay Amazon 0.01 BTC every 100,000 queries. I could use software which displays ads to me and it would include this service for free. Nobody stores my private keys for me so even if I stop paying the subscription service, I'm still able to spend my bitcoins by becoming a bitcoin node or finding an alternative provider.
**Edit**: also, about 70% of the transactions can be permanently deleted from storage with no effect. This is mentioned in the article you linked.

The fees go to whoever mines the block which contains your transaction. You don't have any control over it so yes, it is essentially random. By the way, transactions can't go any faster than about 10 minutes, regardless of fees. So usually offering fees will not make your transaction transmit faster.

Because currently I put my card and my PIN number (they use PIN numbers for all card transactions in the UK) into a special sealed terminal which is mass-produced and is difficult to open and modify. What you are suggesting would basically look like any webcam so that anybody could make one on their own. Each one would look different so there would be no way to tell whether this one was ordinary or for nefarious means. Also the software would run on an ordinary computer which as everybody knows can be easily modified.
Plus they can take photos of my card but if they don't also see me enter my PIN into the special box (or a special online password which only applies to online purchases and I only put in on the Visa website), they can't make charges on my card. Unlike your card which has the actual QR code printed on it, and either doesn't use a PIN or uses a standard keyboard as a PIN pad.


No current card holds people's funds as punishment when they are suspected of lying. Why not just return all their funds and cancel their account? The dispute has wasted more of your time than their future custom will likely give you.


You didn't think of any of these questions and therefore you didn't think of any solutions, which means your system sucks. So in other words you had the initial idea, but you don't have the technical skills nor the thinking skills (apparently) to develop it into something which can actually be coded, nor the money which would enable people to actually use the system, and yet you want people to give you credit. You also specify dubious parts of your system (like using webcams instead of barcode scanners) as though you think somebody will go out and implement it exactly how you like it, just because you think you got the idea first.
When somebody does implement it, they will have thought about all these points and many more, and therefore the system will not look much like yours at all.
PS: currently there are no benefits to BTC for in-person, non-anonymous transactions even if a card system existed, so nobody is making this, or if they did make this they wouldn't print people's real names on the card. Accounting requirements also make it difficult for companies to accept currencies other than the fiat currency of the country they are in. In a few years perhaps BTC will have reached the level of use where companies can consider using it like this.

This will only happen if the computing power keeps grows rapidly indefinitely. It's not about how much computer power there is, just about how fast it's growing.
Here are the numbers:
Every 2 weeks the difficulty resets so that a new block is made every 10 minutes. So if a new block is being made every, say, 8 minutes, then there is 25% more computing power mining coins than there was two weeks ago. This only lasts until the difficulty reset (which is every 2 weeks).
Let's assume the computing power quadruples every year (really generous assumption). This means that at the end of every two week period there is 5% more computing power than there was at the beginning of the two week period. So blocks could be minted up to 5% faster than planned.
The 18 million bitcoins point is planned for 2020, so it might happen in 2019 instead of 2020.
By the way if the computer power on the network suddenly doubles, the time it takes for the next difficulty adjustment halves, so it's actually corrected sooner.

Or is the intention that HubCoin will be the big one, and ChainZ, ChainY etc will be much smaller?

You really don't understand how bitcoins work. Firstly, addresses aren't compromised when coins are transferred from them. Secondly, *transactions* can be trimmed when all their *outputs* have been used.

Why would a finance mogul feel responsible for preventing crime? Why does it have anything to do with them? They are neither complicit in crime nor seek to prevent it.
It seems more likely your relative wants to charge a tiny fee every time somebody transfers ownership of money; cash doesn't allow that. Maybe your relative wants the valuable marketing data which is everybody's spending patterns; cash doesn't allow that. Maybe your relative wants to increase start-up costs for running a business and accepting payments, and to impose contractual obligations on businesses which want to accept payment; cash doesn't allow that.

Shopkeepers can't afford to wait an entire month for payment. Also, if I make a purchase on the last day of the month, there's no time for me to place a dispute.
Can you also explain how
* As a customer, I know that the shopkeeper isn't using a modified version of the software which stores a photo of my card and puts charges against it (possibly months later)
* As a shopkeeper, I know that the customer isn't going to baselessly dispute the transaction in the hope of getting it reversed, and thus wasting my time and probably money
And can you explain what the point is of bitcoins being anonymous *if the card has the owner's name printed on it*?
Can you explain why you chose QR codes and webcams when all shops already contain an ordinary 1D barcode scanner?
Do you have the patience and the money to actually start the business and deal with all fraud disputes, or are you just going to write the code for it? Do you have the money to pay people to read and resolve fraud disputes? Are you going to publish your real name so that people know they can pursue you in court if you steal their money?
Which shops do you envision using this system, initially? How will the fees compare to debit or credit card fees?
Will I be able to use this card to purchase cash (USD notes) over-the-counter at a currency exchange?

The mistake was treating it as though every man and his dog will need to run their own bitcoin node which is not the case.
What I'm talking about is *not* an eWallet. An eWallet requires you to store your private keys on somebody else's server. You give up control over your transactions with an eWallet. This is not an eWallet.
Think of this as being roughly as difficult as setting up your own email. You could set up your own SMTP and IMAP servers, but most people don't. Yes there will be big players, but (we hope) not to the extent that they can collude and do whatever they want. Anybody with a stake in the system will want to run one, e.g. the EFF, Wikileaks...
What I'm talking about isn't transaction fees, it's something which is a far easier service to provide compared to mining. Do I pay to run queries against Google's database? Do I pay for Google Analytics, reddit etc? In the same way, I wouldn't pay for this.

It's called VAT because it only taxes the value added.
E.g. if I pay £0.20 in VAT for some raw materials and then make something and sell it, and charge the customer £0.50 in VAT, then I send the taxman £0.50 and when I send my receipts I get back £0.20.
So I just paid £0.30 in tax.
It is basically a sales tax though, in that it is a fixed percentage of the price of the product, which depends on what the product is.

You don't need something that's readable by a lot of people, you need something that's readable by smart, dedicated people. A good exchange is not going to be built by a thousand people idly browsing your code on github. And you ignore that there aren't many developers who can wrap their mind around the LMAX architecture either. Surely you have to test each consumer because one slow one will back up the rest of the system?
Erlang is fine and is pretty much created for this situation, its only issue is that it doesn't have a JIT so it runs slowly, but would still easily be able to run 100* faster than Mt Gox IMO.

I don't know how high it'll go but I'm almost certain that within 2 weeks the price will drop to $300 or below, i.e. the bubble will burst. Then in another 6-12 months it will happen again, only bigger. That's basically how it's gone in the past, so it's how it'll continue in the future until people get bored of Bitcoin or people actually start using it enough for the price to stabilise.
When people treat it like a currency it will move up and down like a currency (i.e. slowly). When people treat it like a toy it will go up and down like a toy.

If your transaction is only picked up by 50% of the miners, it will take two times longer than usual to get into a block (so 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes).

The ASICs just make it faster to find the nonce that will go into the next block; running transaction scripts (i.e. verifying transactions) is not ASIC-optimised because it's not the bottleneck. All non-mining clients also verify transactions, so clearly mining is not about verifying transactions.

Did you see their reply to an "are you serious" tweet? It said, "not really, but who knows what the future can hold". They weren't "testing the waters", they were trying to look up-to-date. The  company doesn't even do business with consumers directly, which means they have no need for Bitcoin, unless huge distributers start using it.
Due to the recency effect and such, it's important to them to stay in the public eye even though everybody intellectually knows of their existence.
As for being "true to themselves", this suggests that you think there is a "self" to be true to. Do you really think the employees of Heineken have a different personality or attitude than those making Stella Artois or any other brand? It sounds like it's you who doesn't know how marketing works.

Because banks can normally reverse transactions if they were done erroneously or fraudulently.

Isn't it easier to print a QR code to a URL where you must enter your own wallet's Bitcoin address to receive the Bitcoins? This would be one hour slower for the recipient but it would prevent them from adding the private key to their wallet then forgetting to send it to another address in their wallet. If that happened under your system the website would move the coins back to the tipper. Not cool.
Additionally the website might last less long than a private key but if you are planning to take the funds back after a month anyway then that's a moot point.

Yup. If somebody has 10 BTC in their wallet and spends 0.5 BTC, that could show up as a "transaction" of any size between 0.5 BTC and 10 BTC.

Right, I meant to say it's illegal.
When something's illegal, it's because of what somebody does. Sometimes the intent is involved as well. But you can't make a law purely based on intent. As far as I can tell, when you asked whether you can "manipulate" the market, you just meant "doing something I don't like on the market".
If it were illegal to manipulate the market by your definition, it would be illegal to write blog posts about a company's new CEO and why they are a good (or bad) fit for the company. Heck, it would be illegal to buy or sell a stock just before the market closes, because people look at that price that evening.
Also, I invite you to devise a full scheme whereby giving away free Bitcoins can be profitable. There's no service that lets you take such a huge short position on Bitcoins.

Yes, maybe they are of value after all, but they probably aren't.


A hole is where things that ought to be illegal are not illegal. This is just selective enforcement of the laws.
It's up to the DOJ to decide which laws to enforce. It seems they've decided not to go after Gaia or WoW, probably on the basis that:
1. It would piss off the gaming industry,
2. It was not the intent of the gambling statute and is only illegal by accident,
2. It would not achieve anything because people aren't ruining their lives through those methods of gambling, and this gambling is not a significant threat to the casino industry,
3. Blizzard warns/bans people who run gambling games *and* people who make gold a "thing of value" (by buying/selling it for USD), so they would not be complicit, leaving
4. The individual players running those casinos, who are probably not running a "continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days", or in any case are moving small amounts of money, making their crime rather insignificant.
On the other hand, if somebody runs a Bitcoin gambling site, I am sure the DOJ will come down on it when it is big enough to threaten the casino industry, and I highly doubt the legal case will hinge on whether bitcoins are "money or a thing of value".

You can also do hmac_sha2(challenge, hash(salt, password)).
So it works like this: Server has a table of users with the columns username, salt, hmac(salt, password).
Client: &gt;&gt; username
Server: &lt;&lt; random challenge, salt (or if username doesn't exist, it makes up a fake salt, e.g. hash(username))
Client: &gt;&gt; hmac(challenge, hmac(salt, password))
Server: &lt;&lt; SUCCESSFUL/FAILED
At this point hmac(salt, password) has basically become the password (i.e. a client who knows it can login.)
Edit: this is even better

DPR might have been worried FC's demands would escalate. That said, redandwhite is probably an account set up by FC.

Your assumption the Bitcoin network will still be generating blocks in 200,000,000 years is invalid.
Although, by then the block reward will be 0... hmm...

I didn't mean to imply that I'de come to the same conclusion. I now have an even better theory, which is [here](
Anyway, read page 21 and the next page up to (d) on [here]( Imagining you were FriendlyChemist, what possible reason would you have for *not* impersonating your dealer at that point?

Wikipedia agrees. It doesn't take away the fact that it's the foremost award in Economics and is selected in a manner similar to the other Nobel Prizes. I don't think the accusations that they have a political agenda are accurate.
It is more that non-mainstream economists see mainstream economists as having a political agenda where in reality they are just using and developing the economic model they believe in.

They can, legally and without infringing any contracts, be exchanged for USD, and often are.
Blizzard try hard to prevent WoW gold being a thing of value, but realistically a judge could decide that it is a thing of value.
Here's somebody who says that even gaia online and WoW may be illegal gambling: [link](

A private key is just 256 bits, so it would be akin to memorising a 77 digit number. The difficulty would be remembering it throughout his prison term. Plus, if the FBI can prove which Bitcoin address he has, they could come after him if he ever moves the money again. It would be apparent on the blockchain.
