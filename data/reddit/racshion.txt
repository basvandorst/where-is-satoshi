Thats alot of ifs.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:31:35
All the alt p and d getting old
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:01:37
What's going to jump it up past 14k
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:02:08
Why July?
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:06:11
Gold seems useless
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:47:11
Well he's right we are the world's most dominant currency...
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:35:01
And what's ur guess by January
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:54:07
Yes. Is that all I should expect. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:05:36
What drives price of gold? Same as btc it's valued because that's what someone is willing to pay for it.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:55:50
Why everyone saying 10k
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:19:03
I asked the same thing at 4000$ then at 7000$ then at 10000$. Chance we may see new all time high this year if not next year
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:08:15
It will go back up in long term
@_date: 2019-07-16 02:22:28
Dinar isn't going to go anywhere
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:36:19
You being serious or sarcastic
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:24:43
Debating. Thinking about selling half and holding half.  If I sell half it covers initial investment 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:47:27
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:53:46
But if I'm wrong and it's less than more money for me.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:57:06
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:29:48
U only pay tax once u sell and turn a profit
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:23:54
The world is not I agree the u.s would be until order and community came back together. I imagine would be chaos for a few months.  Look at every other country where they have crashed. Not pretty.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:26:45
Dang man seems like u know ur stuff.  So do u think we will actually see a 100k Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:45:35
Well i bought I'm at 6k when it was the all time high.  Glad I did
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:09:21
I don't even have one btc haha.  So yes I'm a whale. Was going to say whatever it buy order is I'm buying at 1$ more in case ur right
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:01:36
Doubt will ever hit zero.  The original Bitcoin people will hold forever
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:38:53
So what's the drop likely to bring us to?  The correction
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:18:38
Ok that's cool well I put mine on hold on coinbase so hopefully drops to 14k and I can buy in higher haha.  What's the cboe futures?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:52:15
That's why first rule is don't invest what your not willing to lose
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:43:23
Bro its more electricity to mine it than u.s uses a year by 2020.  So idk. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:05:18
Scam lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:18:28
My buddy bought his for 7200$. I am trying to get 1btc don't even have close yet.  But I buy at the dips.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:20:25
So I think we will see a 20k btc before cme trades I'm next ten days. And then after trades massive sell massive short and it will dip then we will see massive buy and up it goes again.  NASDAQ offers trades on it in January. Maybr 25k a coin by then
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:42:02
Iota. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:18:04
So never. My dad bought some though
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:36:29
Alcohol for sure
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:06:26
When does this need to be done you think
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:05:12
Ya I agree but I'm on hold to buy more til said crash happens
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:29:06
I actually own gold btw and silver
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:15:05
If you don't care to lose it buy btc. Most likely will double or triple in 2018. But remember u can also lose.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:12:21
Idk anything about cboe
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:11:18
Crazy dip
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:52:38
Cme trades 18th either cause it to boom or bust
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:52:16
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:08:35
Then after they dump what will drive btc back up
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:23:09
It's about brand name people are buying it to amass wealth not to trade for goods or services
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:04:00
So think it's all up from here
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:00:52
I sold wish I didnt
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:10:27
At least in the u.s it's not.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:55:15
Should be able to start. Some free advice get iota. Thank me later
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:06:33
Why Monday? Pump through weekend?
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:57:35
But users control the market not wallstreet
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:31:17
I use coinbase. It's alright only down side is alot of volumn can take website offline but we have seen this with a lot of exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:34:24
I have both. Why avoid alts can make u serious money
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:43:01
U mean 17m
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:05:50
Idk andreas
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:06:43
As a u.s citizen I agree
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:09:59
Ok so after they short it on cme what Happens?
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:15:09
Btc has accumulated value not based on use or transactions it's mostly off of exchanges.  So maybe in 100 years it hits zer0 but idlk could be useless but still traded for 5$
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:31:49
Always hold I got burned selling and trying to rebuy lower twice now
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:38:55
To many buy orders in if it hit 8k I myself would be buying more
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:49:22
If it hits 10k I'll actually be able to buy more than a few cents.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:00:43
Thanks. Pro advice see an accountant haha
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:20:22
If it wasn't used for jewelery I bet value would go down substantially. So as long as we have women we need gold haha.  But I get where your coming from
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:49:48
Let's be honest no one knows also these trades don't take affect til January from the way I understand it
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:35:18
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:36:12
I understand. Well if u get it I hope world out for u. I think if things get that bad u rather a can of beans than an ounce of gold. Theirs alot of reasons I don't think gold will be relevant in future but I hope it works out for you
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:26:45
Remember first rule don't invest what your not willing to lose.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:11:16
I didn't see it I'll check again
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:52:38
Really think so?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:39:50
Same haha I think even a correction of 40percent still makes btc very expensive
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:54:31
Truth it has eaten up too much of my time.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:22:08
Capitalism is where it's at socialism is for retarded millennials
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:42:39
Haha because that's what I was told through a buddy that made money off his btc
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:55:39
Well good it doesn't get repeated lol. Suffering sucks. History does repeat itself but with technology don't u think the way it repeats itself will change some?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:17:00
Lol based on what I doubt a bitcoin will hit 1b 1m for that matter but maybe I'll be wrong
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:12:57
I'm asking what will keep wallstreet from just shorting it repedeatky for their own personal gains?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:21:44
Ok cool. So once btc gets hit hard on the 18-19th because of cme. Will it just be users buying it again that drives value back up?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:40:42
When will the amount of electricity it takes for Bitcoin to. Be mined transaction fees and times start weighing it down?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:02:05
I think it will cause a huge sell off of btc or a huge boom.  One reason I'm buying alts
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:43:01
Tax is roughly 30 percent of your profit when u cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:11:09
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:00:42
Didn't happen 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:31:34
Dad went from .09 to .10
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:25:42
Where's ur buy orders at?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:15:24
Unpopular opinion here. But after the dip I will buy because they will run it back up again.  Doing it for profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:13:12
In the u.s if economy crashed currency would be food and bullets. Bartering. I think is what things will result to
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:19:28
Lol and copper and silver. I understand man
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:04:05
I don't think so because that means 650b market cap for btc. That's a 275b gain. Unlikely
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:35:17
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:22:45
I agree but how long til it negatively affect bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:01:30
Bought a Bitcoin penny the other day
@_date: 2019-06-14 10:14:38
I think purpose is irrelevant at this point.  It's just a monetary incentive now
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:48:49
I think reason BTC is having a dip because bch but by December should go up again
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:28:38
I agree. Everyone wants to hit the one million overnight over 100$ not realistic
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:47:21
The last dip was caused by fueding before that I wasn't in the game so idk. But I think if it weren't drop 20 percent the amount of orders placed would keep it from falling any lower
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:43:09
If u think it will go up buy more if u think this is the peak sell. If you think will go down sell and buy when it's down.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:01:55
Seems to be current stability point but perhaps I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:17:03
Bch will go down most likely this week. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:34:00
11k by years end or 14k?
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:57:59
Every week new ath buddy. I bought at 7200$ when it was ath. Now look at me. Up 1k. By years end probably up 3
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:14:12
Bro not crying just tired of this fight. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:06:00
Isn't this the truth
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:32:59
Just remember cme trades start in three weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:02:47
Also just so u know a 9k Bitcoin today is a 10k tomorrow. Sometimes it goes lower but the wall of resistance is raising every day
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:00:30
What exchange did u use and how will u cash out?
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:27:52
BTC has name recognition this helps alot. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:17:33
Tax is capital gains tax on profits.  No one knows ten years from now man and anyone who thinks they do is crazy predicting Bitcoin in two years would be a difficult thing to do
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:34:38
Trying. My bro called me at 3400$ to buy one called him crazy. Two weeks later was 5k thought this sucks haha
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:40:55
They are doing another bcc run. Why it's dropping
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:12:13
They are shooting for second week dec
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:33:10
How much u looking to invest
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:37:24
Always long to term
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:39:00
Thanks bud
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:46:31
Y u say that
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:59:05
If BTC fails so does bcc 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:47:34
Bcc and btc
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:16:01
People aren't buying Bitcoin to sell it or use the service their using it as investment. Also transaction fees and times will be fixed eventually. But don't matter to people buying it for the ride only matters to those selling it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:16:38
What u storing it on the exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:55:42
I did not down vote. But I appreciate the feedback. Some I take seriously and some I push aside because u have the Bitcoin fan boys and the bit coin haters. Hard to get an unbiased opinion
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:22:21
Y u into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:33:37
Thanks for all the comments well the productive ones
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:42:46
Doing another Bitcoin cash run it seems
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:21:55
I'm holding cause I think BTC will eventually be worth 25k.  Once we get their I'll re evaluate. BTC is growing alot in terms of interest from non cyrpto people so still value in it to me.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:43:25
Best answer
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:14:32
I would wait til Friday apparently BTC has a correction going on then.  If their was something to cause a dip this would. Just found out about it 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:06:14
Mine is still up on Android
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:54:47
Get an accountant. Also gains tax not break even tax.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:49:07
What does this mean and why is it important
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:24:19
Maybe 2k
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:39:05
So many down votes lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:27:58
Favorite meme all time
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:04:18
Funniest comment I've read in a while
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:46:05
With public interest growing and more people opening up to it less likely to see massive sell offs. So less likely for large corrections.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:02:01
I bought on coinbase then sent to my wallet. If u are buying less than 100$ i would just buy and leave on coinbase.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:51:44
Coinbase is simple
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:49:30
I think next year BTC will address two of those issues the speed one and expensive one. If they don't I think next 2 years someone will beat them out
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:14:03
Every day more people are pumping money into crypto
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:26:29
We will see man. The thing is of btc ever becomes a real threat to the banks they will have it wiped out in a heart beat. Same with government.  Also btc while I think u can see a dya where it's worth 20k everything has it's limit.  Theirs alot to factor in.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:40:02
So my brother called me two months ago when btc is 3400$ and goes check out BTC. I wait two weeks to buy it hits 5k. People always wait and the longer they do the further behind they get. I don't have a crystal ball but I bet we see a 10k BTC by years end possibly 11
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:53:34
I literally sold at all time high bought back in so those profits were never held
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:39:23
And look at who was right. I read BTC all day everyday. Going to start my own page on it eventually.   
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:57:18
Y don't u think will hit 100k
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:59:46
Think he will see 10k some suggest 25k as more adopt. But I don't think this train is out of fuel yet man
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:21:27
People take life to seriously
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:57:24
I don't understand the key difference myself on the technical side
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:01:27
Basically looks like what may happen is trades could cause a dip then people buy back in and it goes back up.  Or people invest and it goes up more. No one really knows
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:35:24
Why you say that it will drop?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:57:07
Nano ledger u control ur keys it's next step in safety from a wallet run u about 75$
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:16:42
Btw I agree it's here to stay. I just wish crypto would come together to change the world. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:47:46
We're to in my opinion btw none of this is fact or gospel
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:38:15
What did u buy in at?  Was at 8k dropped down to 7500$
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:39:43
Lol that sucks.  Think 7200$ seems to be it's stability point. But hopefully by January be 10k so just hold on. Hope u didn't buy to much
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:43:42
Auto correct... I'm holding my btc til at least middle of 2018 as their is still interest driving it. When the interest is gone I'll cash out before the crash.  Nothing last forever. That being said if Bitcoin is still relevant in twenty years I'll hold it. 
Also going to buy iota because I believe this will take off next three years so I want in on ground floor
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:15:28
Yes but doesn't mean it won't be around for a while.  If btc changes to keep up with the times however it won't lose out. 
The nice thing about BTC is finite number of coins
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:27:49
Lol if u think the train is over sell if not hold
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:44:40
Good dude good. Better late than not at all in bitcoin. Got my dad to buy into it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:24:08
Mycellium is free. Or if u plan on buying more and going long term get a nano ledger what i did.  Also may want to pick up some iota and etherum when u have the cash. O think we will see a 1k etherum next year.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:35:19
Fomo been going on since 7k
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:43:33
Lol well it's not over yet. I think probably going back to 7200$
@_date: 2019-04-04 02:09:49
Correct to what
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:20:01
@_date: 2019-05-14 03:30:47
What make u think that would happen
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:48:32
How long will u let it sit
