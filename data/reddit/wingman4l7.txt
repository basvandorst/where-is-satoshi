Holy crap you're self-righteous.  I've been on here longer than you have -- and certainly long enough to have read the reddiquette.
FYI, I *did* use the search function before I posted.  It was late and I neglected to organize the results by date, so I didn't see anything.  I checked again and it had been posted **3 times** in various ways.  Oh, the horror!
I'd dig up a "just because it was posted elsewhere doesn't mean **it can never be posted again**" meme, but honestly you're not worth the trouble.  You need to practice being civil more than people need to stop reposting.  Relevant username is relevant.

 No matter how trifling the cost;
For the end of that game is oppression and shame,
 And the nation that plays it is lost!"

Ah, OLED.  
Yeah, I hate that about those -- amazing power consumption, sunlight-readable, impossible to get hold of.  &gt;.&lt;

What kind of display is that, LCD?  Have you considered some sort of [bistable display](

Isn't this what the startup [Coinbase]( is trying to accomplish, at least in part?

Hacked?  Not as far as I know.  There was a small leak of some email addresses which was related to merchant settings and Google caching *(and a resultant targeted phishing attack against those user emails)*, but that's it AFAIK.
Besides, online wallets are a good idea for certain use cases -- namely, temporary receptacles for some kinds of transactions.

Uh, this just aired ***yesterday***, so maybe?

How long until Somali pirates forcibly take over your nation and hold you all hostage in return for ransom from your family?
