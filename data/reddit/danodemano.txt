That is my best guess.  Still though if you are going to make a public post about how you "Only accept Bitcoin" you should ensure your website gives the same message.

The whole lack of communication thing is IMHO the biggest issue.  Any large site be it an exchange or social network site has issue.  Communicating these issues to your user base though is how you maintain their trust.  We don't expect perfection but we do expect timely communication and swift solutions to problems.  By maintaining near complete silence on these ongoing issues Gox has simply managed to shoot themselves in both feet multiple times.  Hopefully this exchange finally dies and other's see this as a learning experience of what not to do.  Anyway just my 2mBTC.

Well yes I'm aware they are a scam but I'm still unsure what I need to send onto the abuse email telling THEM it's a scam.  I suppose I could reference this thread but I don't know how much pull that's really going to have.  I suspect (though I have no evidence for this) that they will require more convincing than that especially since I haven't personally been scammed.  I'm all for getting the sites taken down but I feel we should actually send them some evidence regarding said scamming.

From my (limited) retail experience though they aren't very effective.  I worked for a major national office supply chain and we were required to use them on everything $20 or above.

That's not really the point though is it?  Yes I could but an account with verry little karma offering up a "java trading engine" just doesn't seem kosher.  Actually any account offering up this "program" would be in question.  If it was open source that would be a whole different ball game as the community could evaluate the code.

Hmm...  Not sure how you would go about that though.  It would be quite useful though, a probability of transaction inclusion in the next block based on the transaction fee.  I like the idea, though I'm not sure how you would execute it.

@_date: 2013-04-08 00:26:15
The point it though that's it's possible though not real easy.  It would help a lot though to know, at least an estimate, of how long it would take for a a transaction to propagate given a specified fee.  Then the person sending the BTC would be able to specify a fee based on their desired "delivery" time.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:49:59

I do like this idea.  My old refrigerator is kinda hacky but then again so is a lot of my homebrewing setup.  I would likely pick one up but it would have to be significantly cheaper than it is now.  That or if bitcoin continues it's upward rocket I may have a little more spending money soon.  :)

Based on [this]( thread I'm going to say no.  Granted that was the Litecoin-qt client but I'm assuming that since it's the same underlying code there isn't anything in place to prevent an accidental massive fee.

@_date: 2013-11-23 01:57:58


Probably but you have to realize the risk with an online wallet.  The site can get compromised and have all the bitcoin stolen which makes it a huge target.  Look at the Adobe breach.
If your PC gets compromised it likely won't matter if you use an online wallet or something local.  The malware will get your credentials and take the bitcoin either way.  
The only real safe method is boot up a machine disconnected from the Internet using a Linux live disc and make a paper wallet.

@_date: 2013-11-23 01:54:21
This doesn't matter if the back-end gets compromised.  If someones manages to get access to the online wallet's servers then it's game over no matter how many factors of authentication you have.  Not saying it will happen but the bigger the target the juicier is it.  Look at the Adobe breach that happened not long ago.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:22:17
I've seen it.  It's a cool idea but I like the challenge with brewing.  Seems like that would make it was to easy then I would get bored and probably stop.  That would end up being ideal though for someone with very limited space such as a small apartment.

So are you trying to make a paper wallet then?  What is you intended method for storing your coins?
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:47:44


While true it would be unlikely for them to have lost just one bitcoin.  What's more likely to happen is the site gets compromised and ALL the bitcoins are taken shutting them down and leaving a ton of people without their bitcoins.
As for a wallet, [Electrum]( is a nice choice as you don't have to store a local copy of the blockchain.

Eh that's a tough one.  As an IT professional I have a really hard time trusting Microsoft with security in any aspect.  That being said from all the testing and evaluating I have done with Security Essentials I'm actually quite impressed.  I'm not sure I would outright recommend it at this point but I will most certainly not condone it.  I would still pick a third party I listed but only because of the past track record.  Microsoft doesn't have a spotless (or even good) record and that leaves a sour taste in my mouth...  In the end though this is simply my two cents.  Take it (or leave it) for what it's worth.
