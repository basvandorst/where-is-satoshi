I'm at a point where I trust some hacker more than the NSA. In that case, many thanks and congratulations to the hacker. He contributed to the welfare of our privacy against malicious and unethical practices that are carried out by our government. Hopefuly the patches come soon.

Yeah, maybe something like *.i2p* or *.union* degrees.

Can you imagine teachers in the future having a salary that is dependent on BitCoin. How will it look like? If a teacher's salary will be 3 BitCoins a month for example. One month the teacher will get a salary worth of $1500 and the next month he might get a salary worth of $40 just because MtGox F**ked up again.

It seems like any system that can be freely accessed by anyone is always vulnerable to those who like to take more than necessary. 
If we have a lake filled with drinking water and come to an agreement that everyone who wants to drink from it should use nothing more than a bucket to fill the water with. The people who live near the lake would remain happy because they are provided with water coming from the lake and its quantity is maintainable and suffices their needs. But then a couple of foreign guys in suits always decide to start pumping this water and bottling it. 
Outcome: in 1 year there is no more water left in the lake, people living around it have no drinking water, people in suits just go and exploit the nearby forest.
