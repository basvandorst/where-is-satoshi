If you can rent more cheaply than buying, it's better to rent and save while moving isn't _too_ big of an inconvenience, I think. A main advantage of buying is price stability relative to changes in housing prices. The biggest drawback is that the cost of moving after you buy is much higher.

I'm sorry for your loss.
Financial bubbles are really incredibly psychologically stressful. Hindsight investing is just so clear and easy, it's easy to amplify vivid visions of "what could have been" and stew in it. And there can be big swings in fortune that are totally out of one's control. And it's hard to put anything behind you when the hype is still ongoing.
I also hope this thread will encourage others who are feeling similarly to your brother to reach out. There are reasons why it's hard to cope. There are many people dealing with this sort of situation. Psychological health professionals have experience with this kind of problem. There are many people who have gone through this before and returned to a state of satisfaction and stability. Bitcoin is new, but the psychology of the financial boom is not.

It has some of the needed properties for sustaining financial bubbles (in particular, it's very hard to increase the supply in response to an increase in price). It's relatively censorship resistant. It's a good approximate solution to an impossible trustless distributed consistency problem. But that solution is by design as energy-intensive as can be profitably maintained. And many problems that can be solved trustlessly can be solved more efficiently with trust, if trust is possible. It's been put to some real uses, some of which are arguably good. I'd say it's the same as ever.

Fits very well with the [bubble theory of money]( (also a post about Bitcoin). If the monetary premium of an asset (e.g. the value of gold above the industrial value, the value of bitcoins above nothing) is based on that asset's ability to "hold a bubble", that "bubble" can be more than market factors that price an asset (temporarily) above its utility. That's another way of framing the difference between an ordinary asset bubble and monetization that the OP's link highlights.
(That's not to imply that a currency can't be overvalued, or anything about the current price of bitcoins.)

Reading and understanding the whitepaper isn't that hard so far as due diligence goes. Which is to say that you're right, the average person has no desire to understand anything before investing in it.

I don't think it's true that a default on treasuries wouldn't seriously impact the USD. It depends on:
1. Whether that massively lowers the demand for treasury bonds
2. Where the money goes instead
If the answer is that investors dump treasury bonds and buy commodities (as in [this hypothetical]( that leads to a sudden run up in prices. At that point, the USD itself could seem "not safe", leading to a flight from the currency, aka hyperinflation.

It seems to me that he's using the latter definition. The point of that definition is that monetary use-value has to do with intrinsic properties of the thing being monetized.

While we both missed chances at early-adopter "free money", it's neither too late to store savings in bitcoin, nor to use it to purchase goods and services (when it is more convenient or cheap to do so). Buying $100 worth of bitcoin for cents is really great, but it's important to remember that buying $100 worth of bitcoin for $100 isn't at all bad.
If Bitcoin succeeds, there will be a transition from "when/how can I get in for cheap?" (and often "when should I cash out most profitably?") to "what percent of my savings should be in bitcoin, given expected returns, risk, volatility, and my current financial situation?"

Nothing's preventing anyone (with sufficient resources) from implementing a fixed-rate bitcoin exchange.  Just:
1. Choose a price (possibly a slightly different price for buying and selling).
2. Offer to buy as many bitcoins as people will sell you for the chosen price.
3. Offer to sell as many bitcoins as people will buy from you for the chosen price.
4. Acquire enough bitcoins or currency to meet the difference between buyers and sellers.
Of course, they wouldn't have either of the advantages that governments have when fixing exchange rates on their currencies:  You can't print bitcoins arbitrarily and you can't use force to restrict people's ability to trade bitcoins for currency through other means.

I thought Paul Smocer made a good point at yesterday's Senate testimony when dividing Bitcoin into three functions, all of which interact with regulation differently:
* It's an asset or currency or security, a token with value.
* It's a depository system, that is the network keeps track of Bitcoin balances in different "accounts".
* It's a transaction processing and verification system.
Those functions could be separated in some alternative system design, but Bitcoin integrates them in a powerful way. But that potentially makes it complicated for regulators.

An error in my favor is less annoying than an error to my detriment, but the uncertainty about why that happened really doesn't increase my faith in Coinbase.

Even if the drugs aren't illegal in your jurisdiction, other aspects of the SR business (e.g. the money laundering) likely are.

Okay, fair enough, I'm overstating a bit, I can't say whether you were more than _probably_ unreasonable in believing that you weren't doing anything illegal without knowing where you actually were.  That's because SR buyers and sellers were doing things that are commonly illegal under lots of legal systems, not just US law.
Still, I should give you the benefit of the doubt, maybe you live in a place with unusually permissive laws.  Even in that case, it would have not been reasonable for you to believe that the people you were handing your money to weren't doing anything illegal in _their_ jurisdiction.  Did you believe that SR organizers weren't doing anything illegal?  Handing money to criminals is a bad idea even if you have reason to believe you're not doing anything illegal yourself.

1.) It's true that bitcoin can't be "printed" by any one entity. That's not the only thing needed to preserve the value of bitcoin, though 
2.) Hard-forks don't reset transaction balances, true.
3.) Changes still have to be adopted by people running clients, true.
4.) Anyone could create a "fork"; that is, create a client with different rules for validating transactions. In reality, I think people would probably converge on accepting one side of the fork as correct pretty quickly.
5.) The cryptography is sound. You're right to identify exchanges as points vulnerable to political pressure.
6.) Again, the cryptography is sound. But governments generally don't need to break in to seize someone's assets, they have many ways to coerce people into bypassing their own security.

There's an argument, but I wouldn't count on it working if tried.

BFL thinks it's better to have the money now than the machine later, and I agree.
Early buyers still _might_ profit massively if BFL is quick to get early units out the door and slow to ramp up production. But if early units are quick, late units might be quick, too.
That also assumes the hardware is up to spec. And that it's not entirely a scam.
I considered buying one of the little $150 units a few days ago, but that was already too late to be an early buyer at any rate, and I ultimately decided against it. I might end up regretting that, but don't expect to.
Buying now seems like a bad idea.

"Needs batch one orders to pay for batch two" is a similar "insufficient investment capital" scenario to "needs batch one pre-orders to pay for batch one". While you're right I didn't specifically include that in my first case, I think the same analysis applies.
The point isn't that selling miners isn't something producers will do to get money quickly. It's that selling them for substantially less than what they will generate will only seem like a good idea if producers are fairly desperate to get money quickly and lack other means to do so.
Selling them for _more_ than their likely total revenue, on the other hand, will _always_ be a good idea.

Do you know what precise definition of "issuer" organizations like FinCEN are using?  (I don't, and couldn't find it easily.)
To get into why it's a complicated legal question:
* Is the issuer the entity that sets the rules that allow or prohibit the creation of new currency? (correct answer: the whole Bitcoin network by consensus; wrong answer: the Bitcoin foundation)
* Is it the first entity that receives or controls a unit of new currency? (the miner)
* Is it the entity that requests the creation of a unit of new currency? (the miner)
* Is it the entity that actually controls the production the unit of new currency?  And is a reward produced by publishing a new block of transactions (the miner) or validating and accepting the block (the network)?
Probably the regulators will come down in favor of answers that say the issuer is the miner, so that they can hold _someone_ accountable.  But for previous sorts of currency, all those questions would all line up.  Regulators could conceivably come up with super-dumb answers to those questions that would have disastrous results (e.g. "the Bitcoin Foundation is the issuer of bitcoins!").

I see you've already taken all the advice to back up.  And to talk things over with someone who can help with legal issues, taxes, and investing (yes, even if you have to pay for those services).
The biggest Bitcoin exchange in Canada seems to be [Canadian Virtual Exchange](  Get an account there.  Sell in small amounts (5-10% at a time, maybe, spread out over time, until you won't be too crushed if the price drops.  Figure out what percentage of your total net worth you want to keep in Bitcoin.  (Even if you're a big Bitcoin proponent, it probably shouldn't be everything, or even close to everything, Bitcoin could yet go to zero.)  Make sure to set aside enough cash to pay your taxes.  After that, set aside enough cash savings to could cover 6-12 months worth of expenses, if you don't have that already.
Don't make dramatic changes to your lifestyle.  Don't go publicizing your sudden wealth.  Remember that lottery winners often end up in worse financial situations in fairly short order, it's easy to underestimate just how quickly you can spend money once you think of yourself as rich.  The ones who do well don't make sudden major life changes in response to the money.  If life changes are called for, you have time to think them through.  Money opens lots of opportunities, so take the time needed to make the most of it!
Don't quit school or your job, it's easier to cope if you have something to do.  Seeing a psychologist or counselor probably isn't a bad idea (sudden life changes are stressful, even if good!).  Be sure to eat well, get some exercise, and get plenty of sleep.
Even if things don't go ideally, remember that you are not worse off than you were yesterday.  Don't panic.

Gallippi's testimony is fantastic!  Really hitting the pro-business talking points.

Bitcoins are pseudonymous.  The pseudonymous activity that occurs on the bitcoin network is very, very public (since anyone can see the entire transaction history of any address).
The level of anonymity of a pseudonym varies wildly.  Which is good!  There are times when you really want a pseudonym to _not_ be anonymous, like when you want people to know that it is indeed you that they are sending money to.
But a pseudonym is only as anonymous as the connections between it and someone's real identity are hard to trace.  There are certainly plenty of examples (on Reddit and elsewhere) of seemingly-anonymous pseudonyms that turn out (to the dismay of the person in question) to be very not-anonymous.

I have no idea.  I don't know that much about finance and economics, but when it comes to bitcoin, I'm not sure financial and economic experts have any idea either.  Don't think there's been anything like it before (abstract tokens where the value is entirely a monetary premium and supply and transactions are regulated by a publicly-known, distributed algorithm instead of a central authority).  I don't know how to hedge bitcoin specifically.  Currently, the value of bitcoin could drop very low very quickly (and in some circumstances, stay there!), so the sensible percentage of your savings to hold in bitcoin is probably very low currently.
(Obviously, people who are willing to invest more than "sensible" in something highly speculative can make a lot of money, if they're right.)

I think [this essay]( is very interesting if you're thinking about what money is in the context of Bitcoin. I think it sheds a lot of insight on why Bitcoin is hard to price.

Successful money is stable in price, but I'd expect that to not be the case until that asset has _already_ been successfully monetized.

Needing additional inputs for the two-factor authentication helps, but makes it more complicated.
I think you could make two-factor much more resilient against man-in-the-middle by confirming transactions through email and requiring two-factor authentication to be used twice (once when entering a transaction, again when confirming it).  The process would go something like this:
1. User navigates to the transaction page, enters amount and address, enters an [OTP]( from their authentication device, and hits "send confirmation"
2. Mt. Gox generates a random secret and stores the transaction along with that secret temporarily, then sends the user an email with the transaction details and a link to the transaction confirmation page with the secret embedded in the link
3. The user clicks on the link, and sees a transaction page with the info filled in.  They must again login (if applicable) and enter their OTP for the transaction to be confirmed.
If the user's email has not been changed (if they have two-factor on the security center as well and didn't try to access that via the attack site), this gives them several additional opportunities to identify the attack:
* The confirmation in step 2 will have the wrong amount / address.
* The confirmation in step 3 will have the wrong amount / address.
* They may unexpectedly not be logged in to Mt. Gox when they thought they logged in to that site a few minutes ago.
Even if the attacker managed to change the user's email, the attacker now must man-in-the-middle the email confirmation as well.  (Just having the confirmation email is insufficient because the attacker cannot generate another valid OTP on their own without the user's authentication device.)  That still provides the user with some additional opportunities to identify the phishing attack:
* The confirmation in step 2 will be sent from the wrong domain, or be attempting to impersonate the correct domain (hard if Mt. Gox [properly authenticates]( their emails).  This exposes the attack to more anti-spam and anti-phishing systems.
* The confirmation in step 3 will have the wrong amount/address (if directed to the real site) or the wrong URL again (if man-in-the-middled at the attack site).

I didn't even know about LTC until recently, and wouldn't have had the guts to put down $5k on it. You may have missed an opportunity to be a millionaire, but you also avoided being the sort of person who loses their shirt on this or the next bubble. Treat yourself to something nice, diversify your investments, and try not to stress out too much.

Yes.  If you want to do arbitrage trading (which note I am not), it helps to plan in advance.

Yes, it remains a crime, and assets gained through criminal acts can be legally seized by the state. Though prosecutors will sometimes decline to go after people for criminal acts that were subsequently legalized, if it's politically unpopular to do so.
Silk Road was involved in a lot of illegal stuff beyond marijuana, though. Since SR tumbled the coins used in SR transactions, even users doing nothing else illegal were knowingly participating in money laundering.

[Pieces of eight]( does not refer to the US eighth-dollar coin. Though a "bit" was also slang for an eighth of a Spanish eight real coin, and hence an eighth of a US dollar was referred to in the same way.
Also the phrase "shave and a haircut, two bits" [does](  refer to US eighth-dollars.

That's why I said "I wouldn't count on it working" as opposed to "it won't work".  Obviously, reasonable doubt depends on the circumstances of a particular case.
(As an aside, reasonable doubt surely won't get anyone their money back.  For one thing, that dispute would be decided in civil court, by preponderance of the evidence.  For another thing, judges would point out that money was not seized from SR users, but from Ross Ulbricht.  Ulbricht (presuming he is in fact DPR) owes a lot of people money.  Those people are in the unfortunate position of being owed money by a criminal, unfortunate because any attempt to collect will probably lead to scrutiny by the criminal justice system, plus even if they prevail in their case they'll probably find that Ulbricht is now totally broke.)
Anyways, you're right that the case against SR users would be uncertain, and that's one reason why I think prosecutors probably won't make a blanket attempt to go after SR users.  They'll choose high profile targets.  And people selling marijuana might not be among those high-profile targets, but that, I think, is more due to the veritable buffet of options for prosecutors that SR presents, not any particular belief about the impending liberalization of marijuana laws.  But they _could_ go after pot dealers, even in jurisdictions where marijuana has been subsequently legalized.  And maybe they will go after a few low-profile targets just to scare people who would consider buying or selling on future SR-type sites.

Bitcoin is a novel bit of cryptographic systems design, but none of the underlying algorithms and data structures are new. Which is a good property to have in crypto! You don't want the building blocks of a crypto system to be relatively untested.

They could be doing a man-in-the-middle attack, where they use your login credentials to fetch pages from the real Mt. Gox. In that case, transactions and balances will be accurate, and having two-factor authentication on withdrawals will only help until you try to make a withdrawal on the phishing site (at which point they alter the destination address and amount).
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:14:06
Yeah. It's just a shitty property of human psychology. Feeling you've missed an opportunity (especially if peers are profiting) is really painful, even if you did well and your well-being isn't threatened. The feeling of having avoided a potential downside isn't nearly as visceral. Hindsight is 20/20, but it's also blindingly bright.

I thought the same thing in 2011. I noted that I'd missed an opportunity when it was $11 per, predicted (correctly) a near-term crash. But I didn't read up on it, and after that crash, thought the story was over. Wasn't the only one making that call prematurely, clearly.
Didn't get my first bitcoins until this year.

Bitcoin's monetary policy is almost certainly suboptimal. Most of the details are not-particularly-informed guesses. The idea seems to be that anything reasonable will do.
It's certainly not intuitive that a complete inability to change in response to changing circumstances is an advantage.
On the other hand, it's clearly not the worst imaginable monetary policy. And it can't easily be made worse.


Likewise, some of the same vulnerabilities apply, an attacker can always coerce you into opening the safe.

I didn't, but I only bought 2 at $90.  Maybe should have sold one at $200+ and made back my initial investment.  Considered it, but decided against.  Oh well.  Doesn't matter terribly to my financial situation either way.
The things that I'd expect to long-term suppress the value of bitcoin (technological failure (in the bitcoin network itself, anyways), government crackdown) have not happened, so I may well buy some more when things have settled down a bit.

The things I want lawmakers to know about Bitcion:
1. Bitcoin has a lot of innovative features that make it a powerful financial technology.  It's truly a [programmable currency](  Because Bitcoin transactions are public, this means Bitcoin provides a lot of innovative ways to re-implement financial arrangements in a way that's cheaper, more transparent, and more secure.  There's lots of room in this space for job-creating innovation, if the regulation in this space isn't too arduous a barrier to entry for start-ups.
2. Because Bitcoin is public, it provides law enforcement with many tools for tracking down criminals.  Because it is pseudonymous, the origin of transactions is not always immediately obvious, so there's privacy.  Bitcoin does change the challenges law-enforcement faces, but it's not a boon to criminals.
3. Bitcoin is a cryptographically verified transaction ledger.  It keeps track of Bitcoin balances, but could also be used to keep track of all sorts of property.  Governments spend money keeping track of deeds and resolving property disputes.  Bitcoin and related technologies could reduce those costs.

That's a bug in the bitcoin-qt client, not a vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol. Might make it easier to develop malware that steals coins from the machine the malware is executed on. But still won't allow double-spending or the like.

Seeing the effort of Bitcoin entrepreneurs to make businesses that are above-board and polished enough to maybe appeal to the mainstream user. Also seeing the market be encouraged by FinCEN guidance instead of fleeing for the hills. Before I would've said Bitcoin couldn't go big. Now I'm thinking maybe, so I bought in a bit, and have been obsessively learning about best practices.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:27:09
Probably, or only by large firms that have the resources to deal with that regulation.
It would be nice if regulation distinguished between the big players and little operations, as always.  If you're not mining much, there's no way for you to conceal any large-scale criminal enterprise, anyways.  But regulation tends to lightly restrain the big guys with one hand and hand them a permanent monopoly with the other.

He probably means faster for settlement, not faster for transactions. Obviously, if you're a customer, you can swipe your credit card and immediately get your sandwich or whatever. But the money doesn't land in the seller's account five minutes later.

Two reasons why diamonds are a poor choice to stick in your vault and sell in the future:
* Diamonds are actually pretty common.  [One cartel]( controls the supply and keeps the price inflated at the point of production.  That comes at the cost of preventing diamonds from coming into wide circulation, so few people will be buying for monetary use when you're selling.  The resale value kind of sucks, and the liquidity is worse.
* Synthetic diamonds are quite cheap.  If buying diamonds to stick in vaults became a trend, a lot more synthetic diamonds would be produced, driving the price down.  (Anti-counterfeiting is way easier for bars of gold than for natural diamonds.)
While it is a matter of self-reinforcing trends, there's a core of rational thought underlying those trends about how some new thing might be a better monetary standard.  Restandardizations do happen sometimes, when there's good reason.
There's a [follow-up essay]( (I know, you didn't want to read the first, but the follow-up is more directly about Bitcoin) which goes into what properties make for a good monetary standard.  Basically, the monetary premium of an asset is all about ability to "hold a bubble".  (Which is why "is bitcoin a bubble?" questions boil down to "will it be successful at monetary restandardization or not?")  That's why gold beats silver in that regard.  If people start selling gold and buying silver, the price of silver rises a bit and the production of silver goes through the roof (there are a lot of currently-idle but _almost_ profitable silver mines).  That brings the price down again.
Basically, Bitcoin will succeed if and only if there's a monetary restandardization from some thing or things to Bitcoin.  And if it does succeed, expect it to gain much of the value of those things (that is, assets held for future sale, at least most of the value of the world's gold supply).  As long as it seems that Bitcoin will do better than gold, the rational thing to do is to sell gold and buy Bitcoin.  (It won't be _all_ the value because there will always be some dissent and hedging.)
(Long for a tl;dr, I know, but you've seen what I'm working with.)

Okay, fair enough. I hadn't thought about the case of regulations and financial infrastructure making it easier to get money to (and hardware back from) an ASIC manufacturer than money to a Bitcoin exchange. If that's the case, buying hardware might be the better deal.
