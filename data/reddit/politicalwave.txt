@_date: 2014-03-18 04:49:55
From what I have already told you, _and this is my last post_, **he alludes to the fact that he stole the money using the following examples:**
1. Twitter tweet regarding taking from the wealthy: 
2. His name: **hood** as in Robin Hood, as in the thief that takes from the rich and gives to the poor.
3. The use of the verb **to pry** a verb that connotes the forceful separation of one object from another. 
4. His post on Reddit where he alluded to returning with more once has gotten it from the wealthy.
5. This tweet which is used to show that he is living in a world which seemingly necessitates obscurity: 
6. His failure to respond to the direct question of whether the money is stolen or not.
7. His very pointed remark that the **crypto** is **not stolen** but the money is **taken** from the wealthy. 
8. When was I **ever disrespectful to you, when have I called you names without provocation, when have I attacked you without first being attacked by you**?
Now get lost.

Nope, I think businesses that fail have failed for a reason. It is time to move on and use another exchange in practice. 'Rebranding' connotes that the Mt.Gox is still around and just got a makeover. Screw that.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:50:22
The grammar was clear. I don't waste time making sure it's anything beyond reasonably understandable. Nor am I the one ranting....look at your most recent post.

Stealing from the rich and giving to the poor is theft, when you wash it thru crypto it becomes laundering. I do not want to speak to you, I find you abrasive and disrespectful and would appreciate you not responding.

I would like to point out the grammatical flaws in your post above but I really don't see the point. I hope that this experience was a valuable lesson to you and that you get your money back. I don't hope -- and there is rather little hope to be had whether I donate mine to the cause or not -- that you see your money before anyone else. Don't use an exchange as a wallet and you won't have these issues in the future.

Erm, nope sorry. Try again, or rather dont. Your comments make no sense. Unlike paper fiat which cant be readily transferred electronically while under government surveillance,  BTC can be.

Again, not the point. 
That isn't the point. Normally, they can freeze assets and prevent you from paying for a lawyer with that money or providing for your family. They no longer can. They can throw you in jail and arguably they might have good cause to. But your money is secure nonetheless. It is just an interesting facet of the entire CryptoPhenomena

It is no longer Gox if it is restructured. You're more of a fool than a teacher. This is the internet, not a lecture hall. I believe you're looking for r/writingprompts ... If Gox is restructured to the extent that I just said, relocated to a new territory operating under a law code more applicable to a global exchange...it's no longer Gox.

I want to have an honest discussion about how dogecoin is ignoring the  fact that the guy CLEARLY wants people to interpret him as a modern day 'honest thief' or 'robbin hood' based off quotes that include words such as "pry from the wealthy" "take from the greedy what they are not willing to give" etc. instead of willfully ignoring the entire story.

Not necessarily. So long as he never sold drugs himself he can argue that he is unable to be held responsible for the actions on his website. There's a precedent even. Its not the drug dealing, its the money laundering that I think will trap him.

Let's assume for a second that grows up and the world, unsurprisingly grows with him.
Let's say our chip ninja friend ends up becoming quite the orator, leader, and is fancying a run at some state office now that he's become some sort of people's champion.
Let's say that he made some less than chaste remarks about the proper use of chocolate chips in the bedroom and that the elite have collectively decided chocolate chips are bad and that all bedroom activities ought to incorporate oatmeal raisin instead.
Perhaps, in his youth, composed poems -- great odes to his beloved chocolate chips fantasy. These were written decades ago sure, but facebook is eternity. The elite, being all elitist and in the loop, find out about this and use it against him and he is routed in the general election.
When Chip Ninja made those remarks, the elite loved chips of all kinds equally - potato and chocolate alike. But it is too late for him to go back and edit his remarks now, they are already out there, attributed to him but owned by the internet. 
Tor allows us to voice our opinions without having to carve them into our very public persona. Maybe it doesn't need to be hidden *now*, but that doesn't mean something said today won't be used against you tomorrow. Anyone that believes otherwise is touting the mantra of the amnesiac and should not consider a life under the microscope. Stay at home and enjoy your chips while you can!
