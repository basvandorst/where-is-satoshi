have amassed like 733 bitcoins, but have a lot to lern about security still!  somehow not having 2F thing and using my kids name for password probably not a good idea!

I got one from coinbase, sounded extremely legit but when I examined the link urls that gave it up.  I would never follow an email link anyway.  The most worrying thing I have seen is browser plugins hijacking the browser so that when you think you are sending to an address the send is re-routed to a different address without you knowing it.

well, I would say this is eBay's worst nightmare.  So many are going to fall.    All these middle men clipping the ticket every time we breathe are going to be history.  As soon as the world gets a taste of this "free"dom, that'll be all it takes to snowball.

People live in a world of control.  They want to be dominated by local and federal governments and they want to vote against their own interests.  Bitcoin would break down those walls and force them into freedom.  That is both scary to them and undesirable.  They want to be dominated and beaten dogs, it keeps them safe and not having to think for themselves.

I feel that Bitcoin is doing right by humanity for cutting out the middleman.  However it is still falling victim to the greedy and selfish.  What was once the biggest hope for humanity is quickly turning into a speculative game for sociopaths.

just a typical ignorant bitcoin hater that gets schooled anytime they attempt to discredit it.

I find all these wallet apps accidents waiting to happen.  I keep $1-200 in a blockchain wallet and the rest on paper.  Nice and simple.

It could be.  Imagine if Jesus came back and tried to explain, would anyone believe him?  He'd probably get assaulted and end up in prison or a mental institution.

why not a cold wallet?  No hardware to deal with at all.  I keep 90% of coin cold and 10% in 2FA hot wallet.

By 2020 your smartphone will be more powerful than the top mining rig available today.  Exponential growth in technology will always ensure bitcoin has plenty of powerful nodes.  Mining may become a waste of time and money but there will always be plenty of horsepower for transaction network.

When people like Palmquist hate on Bitcoin, you know it's on to something lol.

Not what my buddy at intel says.  By 2020 they expect smartphones with 30GHZ x 36 cores (and that's a conservative estimate).
