$120K divided by 52 weeks = $2300/week
You sure about that bro? Local rent seems to be about $500/week. 
The listing I cite says July 2013, but perhaps you've bought it only recently and are trying to make a quick buck out of it. After all, your August 22nd listing (2 months ago), says it only has 6 bedrooms. Now it has 9 bedrooms. Sounds like you're been trying to pump it up.
August 22nd listing: 
You're not in a capital city; nowhere near one. Queenstown is a major town, but you're even on the outskirts of that. You're not on the coast; you're on the edge of a inland lake. 
OH WAIT - you're not even on the edge of the lake! The picture makes it look like it's right next to a lake, but you're actually several streets and 650 metres away from the edge of the lake.
You're also in the miserable south.
tl;dr get fucked cunt

There's no question other than a rhetorical one; you can't use stickered coins in coin machines.
It could also land your ass in jail. It's a stupid idea.

Have you ever tried putting a stickered coin into a vending machine, or ticketing machine, or the like?
Easiest way to piss people off and coincidentally give a name for which people can blame
Some countries may also consider placing stickers on the coins as defacing them, especially if they're permanently glued on. Enjoy your jail time with bubba if that's the case.
