I disagree. I’ll take to Facebook about it.

I would never buy Bitcoin for my child, and I think crypto currencies are the future.
There’s a difference between getting stocks to teach your kid a lesson and buying into a specific cryptocurrency. This is like selling your P&amp;G share to buy FX futures. I just don’t get the point here.
Am I the only one here who likes crypto and doesn’t try forcing it on everyone/acknowledging it’s incredibly risky?
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:41:37
Yeah I bet

You could do the same thing with a Rubik’s cube.
Even if it *is* the future, they don’t give a shit. They just want to pay their bills. The dollar is the now, and maybe eventually it’ll be cryptos. But for now just leave them alone and roll with the status quo.

That’s not what gatekeeping means, bud

The world has benefited immensely from leaving the gold standard lmfao.
You think FX doesn’t vary with supply and demand? Ok bud.

Well yeah conventional economic wisdom a country will collapse its fiat currency before defaulting on debts... unless you’re Russia circa 1998

Yet you’ll force it on some random shop worker?

This clearly isn’t going to be a fruitful conversation for me.

And then go through like two different third parties and sign up accounts to get it back to USD because I’m almost positive people working here are just trying to pay the bills and aren’t very interested in extremely volatile internet money

I’ll take a dollar over the equivalent in bitcoin. At least I can buy back Bitcoin without the price of my dollar moving 10% in two days.
@_date: 2019-03-23 22:14:59
Okay, in relation to the dollar since 2017 Bitcoin has fallen thousands of cents to the dollar.
In relation to whatever crazy time metric you use, you can just use another to disprove it. Any arbitrary time measure will do. If you do since inception the dollar has risen thousands of cents to the Bitcoin since it’s capitalizatiin is like thousands of times higher.

What if I don’t like the concept of Bitcoin in the first place? What if I think monetary policy from a strong central government is an effective way to qualm inflation and offer bespoke support to a unique economy?
Bitcoin is a niche, and it’s only one currency in a vast sea of cryptocurrency. The dollar is the status quo, and if you tip in a currency rarely ever used (mkt cap of bitcoin is like half a percent of US yearly GDP) you’re just being a jackass.

Monetary policy has been extraordinary effective, which is why it’s used and is one of the biggest oofs crypto currencies lack by design.
The dollar probably would have completely collapsed if not for monetary policy after 2008.
It hasn’t fell, Bitcoin has risen, and many other crypto’s have failed completely.

Bitcoins neither good nor bad, it’s either useful or it’s not. People will use it accordingly. To say “education” about it is necessary is crazy.
