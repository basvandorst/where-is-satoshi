@_date: 2017-08-14 17:58:15
This is mostly all terrible advice. It's pretty much no different than relying on a penny stock to fund your retirement 
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:35:58
Yes it does matter. Who is going to trust taking payment in something that swings 30-40% lower overnight? This sub is toxically optimistic 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:27:31
Lol all that typing and all you needed to do was say it's guaranteed to succeed at the end to discredit yourself. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:08:47
It's much easier to manipulate a $50B than a $50T (or whatever it is) market. Bitcoin won't be stable enough to actually perform what it's meant to do until the market cap is much larger 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:13:56
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:11:12
Lol. Fantasy land. The official reserve currency will never be Bitcoin. I'm optimistic for its future, but having realistic expectations is important in speculation and investing 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:15:18
Yeah this stuff makes me sick. There is some group of people that think it's impossible for Bitcoin to fail for whatever reason, but they're just so wrong. For one, the people moving the market right now likely aren't on Reddit. They're likely either institutions or governments or billionaires, and if they want to leave for the next big thing, they will wipe out a large chunk of its value. There are a million things that can go wrong, and a lot of things have to go well for it to succeed.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:21:53
Worth approximately $1984
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:03:26
Not even fucking close. Market cap is 50B compared to the what, $60T probably circulating globally?

@_date: 2017-08-08 20:22:05
Misleading. There is nothing stopping a better competitor from gaining more traction and eventually making Bitcoin worthless for all intents and purposes. I know you're pro-bitcoin, but you really are giving dangerous advice to people with little financial background.
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:00:41
I usually use a rubber for that
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:52:49
It's not. Price is extremely volatile. If the actual big investors (speculators) lose faith, the price could drop 95% in less than a week and never recover. Everybody needs to quit pretending this is some foolproof concept that is sure to achieve actual mainstream global adoption. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:14:21
Not true. That's just the "passive" way

Silly conspiracy theories. Kim isn't risking his security for the chance at a decent return on a speculative currency. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:44:39
People will have to spend the coins. There would be a massive sell off 
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:17:59
Yup. The general public will certainly question whether it is worth it to spend $8-9 to buy $500 worth of currency to spend.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:06:52
The problem I see that people like him need to educate themselves on investing and finance *first*, before jumping headfirst into some wildly speculative venture such as Bitcoin. That way they won't be so confused in 2 years when they lost their entire life savings because they didn't diversify, and believed the idiots that keep saying it can't fail
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:12:50

I told my girl we'll go to the Caribbean if my holdings double. She's now interested.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:49:41
The value can go down. Using it as a form of payment isn't really going to be popular for now because why would you spend any BTC if it'll be worth more tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:02:59
Sounds pretty defensive 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:16:28
Lol. And there is no reason more than 1% will ever use it. That is the flaw in your logic. You're assuming that major players won't jump ship, won't find a better alternative, no technical problems arise, governments don't ban it's use, and several other factors. Honestly, the number of people using it won't matter, the only thing that'll matter is whether the whales are using it. Don't forget that a huge portion of the planet doesn't have enough income to save a dollar a paycheck, and you think they're ever throwing money into Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:35:25
Lol where? The black market? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:27:20
I would bet that the actual number of people owning or using Bitcoin in developed countries is less than 1 in 100. A lot of people here have bizarre perspective because they live in tech hubs surrounded by other people &lt;35 years old, male.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:37:32
Nobody knows and if someone acts like they do, they're completely full of shit.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:47:58
You're one of the morons who'll put your entire net worth in Bitcoin and lose everything when/if it tanks. You can keep up with all of the tech and know that end all you want, but great ideas fail all the time for a million reasons. You're just a fanatic with no perception other than that of a fanatic. Just because it's a great concept doesn't mean the world will adopt it. I seriously suggest you tone down your fanboyism and look at Bitcoin through a common, non-tech savvy middle-aged person. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:10:42
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:21:15
Lol you're talking about something totally unrelated 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:06:19
And he's not wrong. Don't forget that Reddit and this sub are an echo-chamber. There are a lot of ways in which Bitcoin can die. If it was a sure thing, anyone halfway smart would be buying 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:55:24
Tax evasion is still illegal
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:23:44
That's exactly what you said. "It is rising therefore it's a good investment". Incredibly misguided thought.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:12:04
Because there seems to be a lot of people who know a lot about the technology, but almost nothing about finance. I'm flabbergasted at the amount of comments I see where people tell fledgling investors to just keep buying and acting like  the price can't go down. The reality is that it is one of the most volatile, speculative things out there. There's no guarantees that Bitcoin will be the next US Dollar. The market cap is still small enough that big investors can manipulate the price of a coin, and there is no regulation in place to stop them from tanking the value via nefarious ways such as spoofing.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:33:45
How? Do platforms like GDAX have have the capability to lend BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:58:15
Probably not
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:49:36
It's not a share. You wouldn't say "I bought shares of US Dollars"
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:44:20
Lol it crashed 80% from $1000 and didn't recover completely for 4 years. Are people too lazy to look at the charts?
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:11:35
Maybe &gt;40%+
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:34:06

The obvious thing wrong with this comparison is that Nintendo produces a product, has profits, etc. Bitcoin is just a digital piece of nothing but speculation.
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:44:39
I think the real money hasn't arrived yet. Right now, it's mostly Silicon Valley millennialist investing small amounts, with a few big fish swimming around. When institutions start making serious investments it has a lot of room to run (and also will be easily manipulated)

@_date: 2017-08-14 17:52:05
It's the same thing. If you have less bitcoins than before, you are essentially selling out of Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:15:01
It's better for observing trends when growth could reasonably be classified as exponential. The first $500 run of Bitcoin's since inception chart is essentially meaningless because it is basically a line running along the x-axis with seemingly no large movement, even though growth was in the 1000's%
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:31:42
Nothing. That guy probably only understands Bitcoin, not investing 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:53:39
Or, it won't. Nobody knows, and it's far from guaranteed to succeed long/medium-term. Believing otherwise is completely idiotic. It could fall to $400 this week and stay there forever.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:28:12
Well, even if it takes bitcoin 60 years, it won't be of any benefit to any of us.
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:17:49
Every once in a while thrown in between the people paying their kids allowance in BTC or taking out credit to buy it. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:50:59
That's because the price is more influenced by the big fish. They can manipulate the hell out of the exchanges because there is no regulation. There is no predicting day to day pricing. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:47:54
Lol this subreddit kills me. Everyone needs to realize that Bitcoin is highly speculative and could crash to $200 in a week. The concept of risk vs. reward is lost on a lot of crypto-enthusiasts 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:02:33
If that was all you had to invest, putting it all in Bitcoin would be unwise. You could put some of it in Bitcoin, but the number 1 rule of investing is diversification. Actually, investing wouldn't really be the proper word for Bitcoin, it would be speculating. However, if you don't care about losing almost all of that money, and you're income is such that'll you'll be able invest in other things soon, go for it. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:30:18
That's fundamentally wrong. If something already rose in value, the time to buy it was before. Ever heard buy low, sell high? 
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:19:34
Pretty defensive there, guy. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:25:48
Sell them
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:38:33
Because the CC is just as fast, if not faster than a barista fumbling around for change. The CC allows you to track these little purchases with no effort. You get rewards using most CC. Actually, using cash is absolutely idiotic these days, unless you have self-control issues. Unless you're one of those weirdos worried about the NSA knowing you drink a Venti with one shot of espresso 3 times a week, it makes zero sense to use cash. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:20:15
Buying any amount of Bitcoin is speculation at this point. It's semantics, but you're right, I don't consider it an "investment" as much as a gamble or speculation 
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:36:48
This is what young, inexperienced investors think. They say "why don't you just buy at the bottom", meanwhile, you can't call the bottom accurately, and you have a higher chance of being unemployed while still trying to pay bills. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:35:16
Value is subjective in a sense. Value to an investor means buying at a discount and holding until appreciation. You don't buy something when it's already "valuable". 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:19:16
That should be a warning 
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:05:12
Try selling that to the general public. They could care less, and our ignorant to what that even means.

True. I just think people don't like the term "speculation" connected to Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:14:37
At this point in time, the USD is still the most trusted currency in the world. Remember, good ideas die every day. This sub has a mentality that BTC can't possibly fail because the tech is so good. People who know anything about investing know that that is how you end up broken.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:33:16
Bitcoin could drop to $10 in a week. Vanguard funds will not. Ever. Bitcoin is speculative, vanguard funds are not. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:22:52
Lol that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard unless you have like $500. Bitcoin could very easily crash very quickly, don't kid yourself otherwise and don't listen to the idiots in this echo-chamber who tell you otherwise. Just because the tech is great doesn't mean shit, great concepts don't always fully come to fruition.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:25:18
Lol or $1000. Nobody knows what's likely 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:35:18
Bitcoin will go down too. Honestly Bitcoin will likely be remembered as a fad in 20 years, having been replaced by a better competitor. Vanguard won't.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:43:08
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:10:06

Idiotic post. It's funny how many people here understand the tech but are practically retarded when it comes to finance and investing 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:59:21
It won't. Ever. Not even close.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:12:57
Not in the way people are hoping. There is actually very little adoption. Probably less than 1% of people in developed countries own any amount or have used Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:46:30
Wrong 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:57:36
Not at this point. It's market cap is still small enough that big players can swing the price, intentionally and unintentionally.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:13:23
Worst advice ever heard. You'd be barred from FINRA/SEC if you suggested this with even halfway safe investments lol. Leverage is nothing to fuck with when combined with speculation 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:06:00
Irrelevant 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:56:51
lol I didn't know bitcoin was at $6000 last week. Try ~25%

Idk about you, but I don't sit and watch the chart all day ready to sell at any given moment. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:30:29
The people who are affecting its price are using it for speculation. They think they'll make a quick buck. And they have. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:15:18
Sure, but just because crypto is going to be the next big thing doesn't mean bitcoin is going to.

You lose all credibility when you say *will*. You're not a prophet, you're not special 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:14:43
Lol no shit. But most people aren't (and shouldn't) cut out all nice things in their life so they can buy a highly speculative currency that can easily tank at any time. We need to quit pretending this is some guaranteed thing that we're just so smart for seeing what others can't. It is extremely risky, and most likely outcome is that thousands of people will be fucked over. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:56:51

@_date: 2017-09-07 21:25:00
Correct. This is the textbook reasoning why deflation destroys an economy. If people know their money will be worth more next year, they WILL put off purchases of things like cars, houses, Tv's, and any other big or medium ticket item. You'd be an idiot not to. Sure, bitcoin will have no visible effect on the economy for many years due to its tiny size, but someday it could.

@_date: 2017-09-09 00:13:30
Because it was basically a giant vertical line. If many people were selling out at once, it would be a more gradual path down. Think about it, what are the odds that a whole bunch of people essentially hit the "sell" button on $100m worth at almost the exact same time 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:10:46
What are you smoking? Are you really so confused about bitcoin that you don't understand that it is not like a regulated stock market? Who exactly is going to enforce these unenforceable "laws"?
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:15:54
Because this sub is full of delusional nuts who think they are so smart and that bitcoin can't possible fail
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:31:25
You're blind. When we can (and it's efficient, and cheap) to buy things on amazon and Walmart, then you can say that. But as of now, bitcoin is like walking around with store-specific gift cards; not much use in your everyday life.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:15:18
