Not dancing around it at all. I fully believe it was artificially and unsustainable high. I have no doubt and no problem admitting that. But, the point still remains, you're trying to base Bitcoin's success solely off of an an ATH that was only attained for less than 24 hours which leads to some very wildly inaccurate assumptions. To understand the success of currency you need to observe it's behavior over its lifetime.

Unless you somehow have access to Coinbase's internal databases that house userdata (linking txs with usernames), in what way does this compromise privacy. Publicly, all that's seen in the batches of transactions are the input/output and tx hashes. I don't see the problem here. It's like saying "I'm going to observe all txs being made with one of an exchanges hot wallets that does thousands of txs and keep track of the tx ids/hashs." Ok...and what good will that do if you don't know what accounts each tx hash belongs to?  
  
**Edit:** Wait, you do realize that many exchanges publicly expose/provide their hot wallet addresses (for accountability sake), so users can view the txs on-chain, right?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:56:57
My exact thought while reading this thread. Best thing I've seen in awhile.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:44:13
With the amount of txs on the address I wouldn't be surprised if this was one of an exchange's hot wallets.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:06:30
Honestly, in my opinion (take it for what it's worth), the safest bet is to buy whenever you can. Buy little by little over time each time you see a dip. This is called dollar-cost-averaging. That way you get the safest bang for your buck. But, again, I'm just some stranger on the internet, so take my advice for exactly what it is, advice. It isn't fact, just my method. Using this method I don't worry so much about violent dips or rises.

@_date: 2018-01-18 14:07:46
Ok? But, you do realize that that ATH was obtained in an unhealthy, unsustainable bull run, right? Seeing as the price was around 5k back in September, do you really think that ATH is all-telling? This was simply a spike showing that public interest has become a bit more widespread. The market is still very unstable and will be for some time before settling. To base everything that's going on around the ATH is a very irresponsible decision. Try to look at the big picture of where prices were a year ago.

This has already happened (and it was to no surprise to most using coinbase), so I don't see your point? Coinbase has agreed to provide records of all accounts that deal with $20,000 in trading volume in order to tax them accordingly. Bitcoin is not meant to be a tax-haven for people who wish to launder. If you believe that's the purpose of it, then you're sadly misinformed on its purpose. Just because it seeks to take away power from financial institutions and give individuals ownership of *their own* money, doesn't mean they don't still have to pay taxes on said money. If you're job pays you in crypto, they still have to report it to the irs and you still have to pay taxes on it. Plain and simple.

What about when the troll complains it costs $10-$25 to move that $5? I feel like doing this (at least right now) will actually just hurt our case. Especially since those who push bitcoin cash as bitcoin could swoop in and do this afterwards and the user would then be more apt to accept bitcoin cash with their current low fees. Note: I'm not a proponent for either side, I actually only hodl bitcoin atm. I'm just saying that this might not be the best time to do this sort of publicity stunt if we're looking to gain more adopters.

I don't trust it for long-term storage. I go the paper wallet route for now until I amass more and move to a hardware wallet. When I do sweep my paper wallets I do it using Mycellium. If I want to receive any sort of coins from someone (for freelance gigs, etc) I have them send to the Coinomi address, convert it, then send to my paper wallet.

The mempool is still very backed up. If you want to send when fees go down you just need to wait it out until the mempool clears a bit. It could be a few more weeks though. A lot of txs happened over the second half of December and new year, likely because of holidays and people gifting btc.

That is interesting, thanks for the info. However, this doesn't take away from my main point that batching has no effect on privacy. Obviously each country would come up with their own form of financial laws involving crypto. Whether it be similar to non-crypto laws is up to those countries.

I think this climate of rapid and massive buying/selling is actually good for the general adoption of btc. This draws people in initially. They just need to be educated about how btc is intended to be used and not to worry when the price drops and/or begins to level out. Once it starts stabilizing we can then start expanding the adoption and the everyday use in the real world.

But, what I'm saying is those fees and tx times are temporary. They will be worked out as time goes on. It'll just take some time. I completely agree with the statement about being tied to coinbase / gdax. I was just suggesting that as a temporary measure for traders/avid users that still want to trade or transact with btc while fees are still rampant. I completely agree that the fees and tx times are outrageous, I don't dispute that in the slightest.

You have a good point, I do agree that thus far the progress and motivation has been greatly underwhelming.

Transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:31:41
Totally get it. During unexpected spikes and dips that's usually your best option since its instant whereas limit orders can fail to be fulfilled in that beneficial window. Just gotta eat the fee in those cases. At least gdax market orders are only 0.25%

That's all it takes if you have a limit order in.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:29:52
That's due to massive backlogs of transactions. Again, this is something protocols like the Lightning Network are supposedly going to remedy. For now it's best to take advantage of coinbase and gdax. Transferring between the two are free (and instant). And if you need to send to anyone outside of coinbase, transfer the funds to gdax first, then transfer out of gdax to that btc address (for free). That way you avoid **any** transaction fee :) I know it's not ideal, buy this is just the very beginning of this new era of currency. There is bound to be a large learning curb and a lot of issues. Just like with anything in the early stages.

At first I thought it could be, but you're right. That'd be insane.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:55:55

Like I said, it's still *very early* in mainstream adoption. Right now, the public is just starting to be exposed to the cryptocurrency world (read: btc futures opening in the stock market sunday night). With things like Lightning network and the like in the pipeline (yes, yes, I know it's been for awhile) that'll eventually remedy the fee situation. The larger/faster the mass adoption the more apt the devs will (hopefully) be to complete the protocols that will allow for quicker transactions, in turn providing a way to keep the network a bit more fluid.

It's as untraceable as btc that's been on an exchanged and transferred to someone else's address off-exchange... so, the answer is no. Just because it's been on an exchange doesn't mean the irs is tracking that btc, it tracks the transactions connected to the account in order to hold the account holder responsible for the taxes they owe. If they send btc off an exchange to another friend the irs has no clue who that friend is if the address doesn't belong to an on-exchange wallet. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:50:41
They were *hoping*. Also, keep in mind those people were likely basing that off of the unhealthy bull run that took us from 5k in september to the ATH 19k (which only lasted &lt;24 hours) sometime in late November/early December.
