Heres something fun to throw around:
Take a look at Bitstamps order book here:
Group pricing by $100
Scroll down.
There are only 16,000 bitcoins in the way of $90,000/BTC
(Obviously this doesn't account for added selling pressure on the way up, but its fun to imagine what chaos a market order smaller than the auction price would create)

I assume if someone pressed the "Home button" on that ipad, it wont do anything because Charlie is already at home?

Use a fractional amount of bitcoin to experiment and learn how to use popular wallets like blockchain.info or electrum.
Learn how to securely print paper wallets and how to sweep the balance to a hot wallet. (Always sweep the whole amount from a paper wallet)
Hang out in the bitcoin beginners subreddit. 
Once you have skin in the game, expect to be checking prices like a maniac, learn to separate your emotions when price goes against your position, and determine if its really a rational reason to sell. (Usually its not)

This post is rather passive aggressive, and makes me feel a bit uneasy being a part of this community. And people wonder why bitcoiners aren't  taken seriously....
Other than publicly detailing the Winks's "setbacks" I fail to see your point. This shouldn't be the place to publicly chastise individuals trying to make a difference. 
What have you done in this community? Buttcoiners are over there ------&gt;

Incredible accomplishment! Bitcoin has truly been through thick and thin. Never a dull moment in this space!

I really wanted to like Brave for iOS but couldn't get over the fact that I couldn't open links in new tabs by holding or double tapping. Missing such a simple feature makes browsing and redditing a pain in the ass.
