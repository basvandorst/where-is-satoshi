@_date: 2018-01-10 15:36:53
2 years ain't shit.  You clearly aren't looking at the bigger picture.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:26:00
how did you manage that when B is almost at 16k this morning?
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:53:51
You're killing it out here.  Spread the love
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:01:17
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:12:57
It's different because bitcoin is a technology not a business listed on the market.  It is following a tech adoption curve not a stock curve.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:13:22
I love other people.  I never love money
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:30:21

@_date: 2017-12-17 21:11:53
that was eric holder
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:02:25
they sure as hell tried.  They were very adamant about how the bubble was instantly going to pop.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:13:39
someone always expects a crash.  Keep on expecting
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:39:51

little rogy verga
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:51:22
I find it funny how all these fuckin trolls show up out of nowhere at the exact same time
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:12:57
that's because these dumb bitches aren't smart enough to think for themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:14:50
If you're so smart then which alt coins are you buying into now?  Still plenty of options to strike it rich, if you're lucky enough
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:49:04
no we dont need them
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:07:07
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:43:17
yeah that's the bullshit rumor that's been floating around.  But it's not true.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:53:36
Oh hey you're back again trying to get people to dump.  I remember you from the last pathetic bcash pump attempt.  Go back to sucking off roger verga and get out of here
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:06:28
you're worth it bb
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:43:26

@_date: 2017-12-22 20:29:40

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:07:20

@_date: 2017-12-24 20:15:53
yeah.  it means hold
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:34:26

@_date: 2017-12-24 13:49:46

@_date: 2017-12-09 22:21:06

@_date: 2017-12-18 21:42:53
i'm never not not selling
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:10:19
don't be too harsh on him, he's a republican.  It's not kind to make fun of the mentally retarded.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:47:01
would you rather frighth 100 bcash sized bitcoins, or 1 bitcoin sized bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:07:23

@_date: 2017-12-16 14:48:31
we;re gonna be rich!
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:17:19


roger verga and his team of bcash crooks would make Satoshi absolutely sick.
@_date: 2014-06-22 20:23:05
I'm suspicious already.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:58:25
Not really
fit to be eaten (often used to contrast with unpalatable or poisonous examples).
"nasturtium seeds are edible"
synonyms:	safe to eat, fit for human consumption, wholesome, good to eat; More
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:17:27
yeah... Quantum Computing might change all that.
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:01:12
lil verga still at it, huh?
@_date: 2014-08-24 03:20:18
They don't care how secure it is they just want their cut.
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:15:04
They're not going to be able to stop it.  This is the next war on drugs.  They're just going to use it as an excuse to search people and lock them up.
@_date: 2015-05-07 01:48:17
@_date: 2016-06-09 17:25:20
Is that why we have the largest prison population on the planet?  Wow such free....  The world has changed man, america has been left in the dust.  You sound like someone who has never left the country.
@_date: 2016-06-09 17:23:04
Well if you weren't poor before, you will be once they take all your money from your bank account
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:09:45
Don't trust them
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:51:33
now he can cut out the middle man and go directly to the dark markets
@_date: 2016-11-26 09:15:22
Is healthcare all that matters?  How does the average happiness of a member of that hypothetical tribe compare to average happiness of an American citizen?
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:29:44
If it would really cause that much havoc on the global economy the fed would never go through with it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:21:48
These trolls and spammers are completely obvious.  They are trying to scam people out of their money.  What the fuck is wrong with some people?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:01:42
lol.  people being way too obvious with this pump attempt
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:11:27
more of a late term abortion
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:24:58
we got a real snob over here
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:16:09

@_date: 2017-11-20 14:44:18
we going for the big one oh
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:34:28
dodging the question because bch as an altcoin has nothing to offer
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:46:10
guess that means it's time to buy more
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:17:43
media frenzy has everyone trying to ride the wave
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:58:28
bitch tryin to hypnotize me for my bip 39
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:05:43


do you honestly believe this horseshit?  Take this very OP for example who spent 6k on bitcoin 5 years ago and is now worth almost 2mil...  Is that providing more value to others than a lower-middle class laborer who has earned a fraction?  It's feel-good bullshit that has no reflection of the real world where many get rich through luck, inheritance, family connections, fucking people over, etc etc.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:46:30
fork shmork.  You think all this recent attention is all because of the fork?  No.  Bitcoin has proven itself by withstanding the other recent forks, and now everyone wants a piece of the action.  It's starting to hit mainstream.
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:55:34
my brain asplode
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:55:18
look in your crystal ball and take a wild guess
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:24:13
Roller coaster was here with you through the worst of times.  Now you got a little money you think you're too good for roller coaster??  Bitch no you're not.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:20:05
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:58:39
nah fuck you
you take the all time highs for granted.  shame
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:42:35
is this really for fun though if your older than 5?

rock hard dip is an oxymoron unless you got some upside down boners

it looks all old and shit but 1972 wasn't really that long ago
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:07:19

@_date: 2017-11-25 21:20:39
there are quantum proof crypto.  The worst thing that would happen would be a required fork to quantum proof
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:12:06
so what exactly do you think is going to cause this supposed crash?
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:23:16
It's already been made
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:17:03
the way he said "so did gold" like it was some brilliant retort.  And then she just blows him out with that "not as much though".  that was good.  that was real good.  
She hodls
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:37:28
well it went from 8k to 5.5k. So yeah, I'd call that a dip
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:34:28
you all in dog?
@_date: 2017-04-19 23:47:05
Maybe you should have cracked down on actual swiss bank accounts then HUH?!  What, it's fine when the wealthy and corporations tax dodge but once your average person has access now it's a fucking problem?  Fuck you
If it's not fine, then close the loopholes on corporations and the wealthy or fuck off.
@_date: 2016-02-20 01:22:33
and blockchain is even better
@_date: 2018-11-30 03:53:54
awwww that's so sweet!  Happy birthday!
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:15:12
it's called market manipulation.  people trying to get others to dump so they can buy low and then pump again late summer / early winter like last year
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:40:36
it's the work of the devil
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:42:44
it is at christmas time
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:59:47
you better fucking be holding on to it.  Don't make any more stupid decisions.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:03:04
I would not be ok
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:05:16
If you mine a coin today, it might not be profitable today.  But if the price of a bitcoin keeps inflating the profits will be realized a few years down the line, no?
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:07:08
@_date: 2016-10-14 22:31:10
but weeds is so awful tho
@_date: 2015-03-21 01:15:43
Troll harder son.

Have you even seen the back of the one dollar bill???
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:25:03
strongly opposed to audit the fed because then everyone will know it's all a bunch of smoke and mirror bullshit and lose all faith in the broken system
@_date: 2015-02-24 02:27:57
It's pretty sad that we live in a world where many people won't believe anything until their TV tells them to.  It's like nothing matters unless it's on the TV.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:49:30
he said that he sounds like an idiot not that he is an actual idiot
