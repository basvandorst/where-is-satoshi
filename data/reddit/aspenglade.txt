The creator not only didn't associate with one side or the other but he denounced it then publicly killed Pepe off to try to do so even more. You can't control who decides to use your works a lot of the time, even less so when 4chan and other places amp the volume on things as a goof on over-sensitive people.

They also have a massive userbase and can build in the user experience needed to have the average grandparent able to use it easily.

Actually, bad media reporting gave it a minor association to Nazis with a relatively small group. The radical left is far smaller than most think, they are just noisy and annoying.
Also, it is a false equivalency to compare with swastikas, antifa logos, or the ISIS flag.... All of those were created by those groups specifically for the intent of those groups or were directly co-opted by them as a whole to the level that the public at large saw them solely as a symbol for those groups. 
The average person not on the radical left doesn't see Pepe as a Nazi symbol, they see it as a cartoon frog used in random internet memes.

Found the radical left sjw.  Pepe is a meme comic and the Nazi association is superficial bs.  Pepe has been used by so many different groups and individuals in popular culture that to claim it is a Nazi symbol is naive and ignorant at best.

While I understand where you are coming from on the QR code aspect, that then introduces the need for using a phone or other device at the sales terminal to make the payment.  For the average everyday user, this is another complication to making a BTC payment.
What I was getting at was that a user could have a preloaded device, whether that is a card, fob, or even \(eventually\) a biometric implant.  All that user has to do to approve the payment is tap and go.

Interesting.  I absolutely agree that QR codes are clunky and not easily used by average everyday grandparents.  Any system that is going to be mass adopted needs to have that grandparent ease of use factor.

I'm talking about the customer.  QR codes are something that many average everyday non\-technical people do not understand still whereas tapping is something that everybody understands.  The point of this is to increase the ability for everyone to just know how to do something.
As for biometric implants, they may not be your thing but they are a thing and they will become more prevalent.  Just because you don't like them doesn't make them idiotic.
