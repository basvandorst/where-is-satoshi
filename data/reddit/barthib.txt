Bitcoin relies on a wide network to avoid trust authorities. If trust depends only on one node of the network (GHash), the network is useless, and Bitcoin meaningless.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:28:51
Right. Do they plan to integrate P2Pool to the protocol and clients? Then, Bitcoin mining becomes natively decentralized, no pools needed anymore.
@_date: 2014-06-03 20:34:46
You reply about the number of bots but where is your explanation about the rest that I just told you?
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:19:06
You are right, we have to watch silently GHash becoming the king of Bitcoin.
In addition to a warning towards GHash, the fundation could also announce that they work on the problem, for instance by integrating P2Pool.
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:16:16
Is it feasible to integrate this new simple rule into the Bitcoin code :
measure the number of accepted blocks coming from each pool in the last 24 hours. If a pool exceeds 30%, reject each of its new blocks.
Therefore, its number of blocks decreases naturally under 30%. The Bitcoin protocol would become insensible to 51% attacks in a decentralized manner.

Kraken is reliable (American company whose CEO is known, bank account in a country where Bitcoin is officially legal (Germany) ) and have profesionnal order types (market, limit, stop, trailing stop and so on).
@_date: 2014-05-28 16:09:29
Indeed, assuming that the Bitcoin price grows exponentially since 2009, the right point of view to study it is a logarithmic scale. Then, I suggest that we are in the blue circles.

Could you create a fork which integrates P2Pool natively such that every miner is working for a unique giant pool and does not need Ghash anymore?

Kraken, definitely.  They are serious : their office and their CEO are in US and well known. Their bank is in Germany where Bitcoin has a legal status.
After sending your BTC there, just trade BTC/EUR (volumes of BTC/USD are lower).

@_date: 2014-06-30 09:04:19
There is a nice tool at Bitcoinwisdom to know the final price after buying (or selling). Buying 3000 BTC would increase the price by about $40, so the increase is about $20 for the buyer.
That's small.

Another point: Their technical analysis always forecast big drops.

 has a selling mode called "instant order". It coud be what you are looking for. Their engine sells your Bitcoins by small amounts and adjusts the price every 10 min. So you will not cause a deep drop, you will follow (for a long time) the market price.
@_date: 2014-05-21 13:44:44
I agree, I started my Bitcoin life with them.
But it is neither intended for daytrading nor even paying a shop in BTC : obtaining your BTC takes at least one day. Price volatility is a problem then.
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:42:22
Because I'm sure bitcoiners are kind persons ;)
Bitstamp has no market orders and this guy does not know how to get his big amount sold. It's my hypothesis.

He contributed a lot to the the adoption of free software, Linux and Android might be unexisting today without him. What he says about the proprietary stream format is right and consistent with his philosophy. There exists free streaming formats so they should be used.
The problem for some people here to understand him is that they are involved in Bitcoin for profits, while Bitcoin is firstly a free software.

I agree that Kraken is the best, but data in this picture is wrong.
Kraken fees start at 0.2%, not 0.1.
Bitstamp interface got the same grade as Kraken but anyone who tried both knows that Bitstamp interface is horrible (you need to navigate multiple menus to check or cancel an order, and there is no market order).
@_date: 2014-06-03 20:19:43
As said, volumes show that there are massive synchronized orders for 18 hours per day and then a 6 hours break.
This regular volume pattern show huge amounts, so almost all OK Coin traders use a bot, and this bot is just an idiot buyer 18h per day?
Then, since most of the volume is generated by the same bots, how can they win money? When a majority of traders do the same thing (buying simultaneously) the price is expected to rise, but here it falls.
@_date: 2014-06-03 13:50:59
I'm not sure. Look at May 27th with 30 min candles. The same pattern occured but price did not rise.
What do you think about that ?

It is a technical correction, expected by any trader. After a rush, there is always a brief drop.

I see rather 2500 BTC at $670 (Bitstamp)
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:42:20
I think that most people want to react as fast as possible in case that a big crash occurs. Using a wallet outside the exchange means waiting 45 min for 6 confirmations... and loosing a lot of money while the crash continues.
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:46:57
Having drops after a rush is normal and has to be expected. Look at November bubble, you will see several drops (take 6 h/candle) along it.
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:49:01
What are the evidences?
China and Russia, together against the Dollar, dislike also Bitcoin, so such documents are not surprising.

What's new?
@_date: 2014-05-22 06:39:09
The right word for "Bitcoins traded" is "Volume". Usually, one talks about daily volume and monthly volume. Moreover, volumes are different at each broker (exchange).
Go to a chart, for instance  and, if you click "1d" at the top, each bar at the bottom is the volume traded over a given day by Bitstamp's traders. Add their heights over 30 days to get the monthly volume. If you go to "Markets" at the top, you can look at other brokers.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:07:28
Without their miners (who would not need them anymore), they are about 25% of the network power.
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:00:55
I don't get your theory. Why would Bitpay move down the BTC price? Each unit sold by Bitpay has been bought by the client, so the overall operation is neutral (on a world-wide and long-term point of view).
@_date: 2014-06-14 11:41:05
One thing that we can be sure about : The market will move to the auction price.
If those BTC are sold for $300, we will speculate that the guy will cash out to gain 100%, so everybody will sold.
If the BTC are sold for $800, we will speculate that this guy is not willing to sell until we reach this price, and we will move up with confidence until $800.
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:09:36
Personnally I don't trust them. There is too much uncertainty about their identity and motivations. In particular, they have high fees but their website is still terrible to use for trading.

@_date: 2014-06-03 19:48:06
Regarding the volume pattern : because they might add fake orders massively and regularly.
Regarding bid ratio pattern : those massive fake orders are buying orders when price decreases and are selling orders when price grows.
@_date: 2014-06-14 07:21:11

In eight months, the Bitcoin network will die if this number keeps decreasing at the same speed.
I think there are 2 reasons :
- nowadays, people have wallets on their smartphones or at a broker. The full nodes, on PC, are useless for most of them.
- with full nodes, people earn nothing although they spend electricity for the network, while minners earn something for maintening the network. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 08:08:31

No bad news? A company holds 50% of the hashing power (they just shutted down some servers to pretend they have less) and China hunts citizens who trade Bitcoins. Moreover, nobody knows the final auction price and some of us sell to anticipate a possible very-low one.
@_date: 2017-02-17 06:44:19
I think it is not due to GBTC investors selling, but rather a lack of new investors in GBTC. Let me explain.
GBTC's rules require investors to wait one year before selling what they bought.
If an ETF is approved, trading there might start within the next 12 months. Then, old GBTC's investors will start to quit GBTC and buy ETF shares because there is more freedom there. New investors will have no interest in GBTC because an ETF brings more freedom, so nobody will be buying at GBTC. Old investors quitting and new investors having no interest to buy what quitting people sell: GBTC's price will decrease a lot.
Expecting that, it would be a suicide for an investor to lock his money in GBTC now for the incoming 12 months. So GBTC's price decreases currently due to a lack of incoming investors.

I trust them since 3 years. Except a scam in their margin system, I love them.
(the FIFO scheme is a scam. If you borrow to buy 1 bitcoin at 807€, and then you borrow to buy 1 bitcoin at 845€, and then you sell 1 bitcoin at 863€, guess which position stays open? the 845€ one, thus increasing the rollover fees by almost 5% compared to the other option.)

In stock markets, the derivative of the price is correlated to the quantity bought. What you describe is exactly that. What you call "3.6" spike is a measure of the price derivative. What you call "new members" is correlated to the quantity bought.

No. The scale is logarithmic, that makes 400 near 1000 in appearance. You

I don't think so. Most people having Bitcoins just want to make money through price increase. The temporary halt does not prevent that. For rare people needing to move BTC, it was already very complicated (see this post and others in the same sub :  ).

1% should be too high. It's a shame. Bitcoin will never grow like that. It's time for BU or SW to fix this issue.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:53:44
I think that the price is about to increase. It's maybe about game theory. Here is the scenario, in my opinion:
MAIN ASSUMPTION : Bitstamp traders holding BTC since last Sunday have no interest in selling there, the price is stuck at a low value while they can sell at a higher price elsewhere.
A - Those who want to sell will send their BTC to other exanges in order to sell there.
B - Those who want to quit Bitstamp, due to safety concerns, are more likely to buy BTC and send them to other exanges, it is faster than waiting for bank transfers and provides more benefit than selling at Bitstamp.
- People in category A do not change the price at Bitstamp while people in category B increase it.
- Seeing the price increase, traders of the other exanges will buy, thus increasing the price there, which is already greater than Bitstamp's one.
- Note that people migrating from Bitstamp will be waiting for confirmations, so will not be able to sell, so the price increase will not brake immediately.
- So people of both categories will not sell immediately on exanges as long as the Bitstamp price will not catch up with the rest of the world, which will be above current price.

Kraken. They are perfect.

As long as a bitcoin transfer needs 3 days to be confirmed (and this delay worsens over time), nobody will use it as a money.
The problem is that the miners are geeks fighting like in a kindergarten because they don't like that their friend suggests an improvement idea instead of using theirs. They are sinking themselves.

Please, don't think that the fee is the reason. The network is overloaded, higher fees would still leave 50 000 transactions aside.
If the miners don't agree quickly on some compromise solution about the block size, news will talk about the slowest payment system in the world. Then, the world laughs and nobody believes in this shitty system, and the miners mine for $1/btc. They cry, stop, and Bitcoin dies.

It's where I bought my very first Bitcoin in 2014. Then I moved to Kraken because bitfoin.de's buying process takes long (days) while instantaneous with exchanges like Kraken.

Moreover, this party ("national front") is hated by all the others, so now you can be sure that the others will not plan any ban in order to avoid people thinking that they like national front's ideas (as they always do).

Because of too small blocks. If the miners don't agree quickly on some compromise solution, news will talk about the slowest payment system in the world. Then, the world laughs and nobody believes in this shitty system, and the miners mine for $1/btc. They cry, stop, and Bitcoin dies.

Works well on cryptowat.ch :

China, yes. As always. I'm personally tired of them and I think I'm not alone.
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:51:52
No. They stole electricity to do so.

I think that there exist smarter ways than counting to crack a private key, in that you do not need on average a number of steps proportional to 2^256. Or, if such a way doesn't exist, is it proven (is there a theorem stating) that it will never ?
@_date: 2017-01-14 11:11:29
Great ! I will take a look at it on Monday :)
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:03:06
Forget about them. Can't you access to real Bitcoin marketplaces such as Kraken or Bitfinex?

Nothing new : we already knew that the leverage was too high, that's why they stopped it last week.

TabTrader is excellent

Nice news. Now, volumes in Europe and USA can be fairly compared to volumes in China, we will really know where bitcoiners are.
Regarding the news itself, I'm more surprised by the introductory words : "recent abnormal fluctuations of the price".
Read carefully. Is the rise to $1100 abnormal for the PBOC? Is it said that they try to prevent Bitcoin from rising?
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:30:24
Yes. The volume will be comparable to the rest of the world. We might be surprised that China is actually not the leader.
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:11:36
Indeed, they are very welcome the day the brokers stop cheating.
So far, I think that BTC's world is tired of China.

Writing your title with capital letters is dishonest.
This political party never got more than 20% in presidential elections and the forecast is also about 20% for the elections in May.
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:47:42
It's because some miners steal electricity. The title is misleading.
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:11:39
Just a bug of the chart I guess, because it has been like that for about 10 hours.
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:18:58
Let me know the day that you need an English and French speaker :)
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:33:33
Read news from a few days ago, you will know what I mean.
@_date: 2017-01-18 11:46:16
Don't worry, they never got more than 30℅ in presidential elections.

It's a possible meaning. But I think that he actually means, within 140 characters : "because it looks less impressive to THEM and the price stays the same for YOU".

Each time the price increases, the average delay increases : people start to use their bitcoins. It's a preview of what would happen everyday if Bitcoin was really used.
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:19:45
Very well spotted !
The 10mn/candle chart looks like the 1w/candle chart. So, we can expect a small drop within the next hour and what happens within the next 24 hours might tell us what will happen within the next 6 months.
