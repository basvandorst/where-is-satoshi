And people worried about btc latest drop. Really nigga?
@_date: 2019-10-24 17:42:36
Tbh i Hope so, imo bitcoin is not about get rich quick, its about Financial freedom, bitcoin dont need to go to 1 million per coin, It Just need to work as a viable option to this current corrupted financial system
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:40:55
Ur probably right a 51% on online would be already good enough for me

Time to abandon the ship
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:56:39
It succeeds when 51% of markets accept it so i could buy groceries with It. That's what i think of btc success.

The Future is the gig economy, in the gig economy is far harder for the gov to tax, the only question is, Will the gov adapt faster than private sector inovation?
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:32:34
You asked How bitcoin Prevent gov from taxing, and im explaining. C'mon, People work remotelly and as freelancers, people get paid digitally, There Will be a moment when people Will realize crypto is better than PayPal, people get paid in crypto, in these freelancers and Works where you are not officialy hired by a Company is far easier to not pay taxes, the only whay to pay taxes is If u get the job on a platform, at the same country u live. I really Hope we are talking about the same thing here
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:43:41
I know, im Just expanding the Topic, and you're right about US, but on rest of the world a massive number of countrys have inflation Just because bad gov management, my country is bad economicaly because my gov dont know about economics, has bad spending habits, and think can print money as he wants, fuck one of the possible next presidents here Said that the fix for our debt is to Just turn the printer on, fuck i talk a Lot, what i want to say is that in most cases big inflation generally happens cause bad management of the gov, in the USA case, these indirect Wars are a bad management, If US was not the world police they would not need to have a massive military budget and could be debt Free, and i know they needed after world war and cold war, but now they dont need anymore and Will not be able to anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:21:23
Not only the banks are bankrupt but almost If not all govs in the world have a huge debt, and the inclination is to get more debt increasing inflation, making your money lose value, making you spend now instead of storing It, creating a society with short term planing, fuck, and this pleb think that govs can keep doing what they are doing, i Hope this Guy have a lot of Fiat when we get the next crash.
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:07:28
Op is refering to his country but inflation happens for more reasons than embargos, also in the Future is more likelly inflation Will be caused by debt and printing and economic Wars than "real" Wars and real embargos
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:57:55
Im talking about after industrial revolution till now and, when i say cash i refer to fiat influenced and backed by govs, in ancient times anyone could issue their coin in precious metals, only when gov start manipulating money is when things Go wrong, like the Roman Empire devaluating their currency to be able to spend more, eg: inflating  It.
