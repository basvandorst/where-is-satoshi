Ok well it was a long shot, I accept that those connections are very vague.
So Bitfinex invested in blockstream, can you share what other companies were invested in and amounts. It seems this would count as assets.
Liquid was a significant cost can you get a refund for this to cover losses?
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:26:17
I realize that Bitfinex is closely related to cumberland mining, which is a DRW company. I see cumberland invested in simplex, and pgp had mentioned before investments in blockstream sidechains. I understand as well Bitfinex signed up for and paid for the liquid system. Are you considering all of these overlapping things separate from helping customers? It seems that there is a lot of money that has been invested and with cumberland's 27k Bitcoin buy which is tweeted by your CSO  which apparently was just wiped yesterday oddly enough you can see the cache here:  (  and is now a DRW company there is some conflict of interest. Would you care to comment on any of these overlaps and Bitfinex's current investments, that could potentially be liquidated?

yea by design development works best in linear fashion to avoid edge cases and give time for testing in one environment. Sure the order of size and segwit/ln was not how everyone wanted but I think this is very important for the community. Rather than put the political noise behind us, because who knows when this will change, we should put the positive noise in front of us.

but stellar stores value doesn't it? A $3,000,000 loan was issued for 2% of Stellars. If it was just an efficient exchange of currencies, there wouldn't be a master currency issued centrally with a 5% total set aside for the team. Does their need to be a central currency to run an open source efficient exchange? Their consensus algorithm doesn't require a centralized currency. It only requires trusted nodes of Governments, Companies and Universities as it states. Even though I prefer the free and openness of mining, this does provide near instant transactions. I'm curious to see what that means, but it still leaves the question, why Stellar credits? In addition I would look at  and see how there is a direct comparison being drawn between the value store of Bitcoin and that of Stellars. Although a generous offer I do admit.

Bitcoin as a technology is a method of transfering representitive value. I can send you $10 USD and you can receive $10USD if you so choose. You could also hold the representitive token, bitcoin itself which fluctuates in value. One important point is to note that if he does not like the way bitcoin value is determined, he can simply utilize the technology to transfer funds.
A ponzi requires people putting money into something, and the future signups being paid off where at scale breaks and the money runs out. Bitcoin issues unique tokens at a set rate, and the values is entirely determined by the economics of exchanges, mining and other factors. I would hope your friend would look up the actual definition of a ponzi. Rather it could be argued, that holding the bitcoin token is risky and for a beginner they should become acquainted to the shifts in value before putting larger amounts of money in. 
Also open up bitreserve.org and show how money can be held in various forms and converted in a liquid manner.

1. Taxes are best determined when Bitcoin is converted into FIAT. Those that hold significant value will likely be required to report their earnings. It is difficult for a government agency to truly know a persons holdings, but for corporate entities they will have to keep a closer record, and will be under further scrutiny. For an individual there will always be a layer of doubt no matter what law is passed.
2.  It is important to understand what technological advantage it has, not what philosophical advantage it has. It promotes economic growth by making small frictionless payments possible, and reducing fees. Also, since it is only controlled by math, as long as the private key is kept safe, it has potential upsides to people under government scrutiny, be it blackmarket, or simply someone persecuted by government. In the first-world it is not as big a problem, some places in the world, they will just seize your account for disagreeing with a politician for instance. 
3. Going forward, since Bitcoin has a monetary value based in FIAT currencies, it will likely carry the same distribution, as the amount owned is that amount bought in. This does not of course count all of the early adopters who are already greatly benifiting. However, enabling micropayments, and potential options for the unbanked, could redistribute wealth to some of the poorest people in the world. It's more of an enabler to those without means to have banking. It also can help some regions in the world, where currency is more volatile than Bitcoin. Hopefully if price remains stable, or at least avoids a massive downturn, Bitcoin can be a safe investment vehicle for people of the third world to maintain a more constant value for their income rather than be at the whim of a volatile central bank.

This is already happening, slowly but surely. It's honestly a lazyness factor for many large businesses. They are making profit, they have their entire accounting system, sales team, registers, etc setup and so they just don't see the benefit of adding Bitcoin. As the market cap, and userbase grows more businesses will be convinced, so I think user adoption and spread of coins needs to be tackled first.
I think we've yet to see the full benefits of micro-transactions, we've started seeing how changetip can make satoshis fun and simple to send so imagine that capability more widely adopted. Competitive gaming, or even money remittance, and commerce in countries where fractions of a dollar are hard to move, I think that's really the future.

Yes anyone can technically filter transactions as they desire, and the core developers have come to consensus on some paramaters to filter. I assume that has passed significant consensus, and has technical reasoning. I can't force you not to modify the code you run, and folks that opt-in to pools should be aware they follow the operators rules. The distinction here, is that should an open-source piece of software be distributed to filter valid transactions simply because a human decides they are unnecessary, even if they are spammy. If they are valid within the protocol then why block them, let the user decide, make the blocking process modular. If It's a security risk, or causes damage in any significant way out of the box to users of the software I stand corrected, but as of yet I've only heard that it is spam, annoying and fees may not be as some miners/pool-operators wish. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 05:20:57
The cost in electricity and investment of miners is not a direct indicator of price. Consider that miners who do not or can not ROI on their existing equipment will not simply keep mining but will stop, and the difficulty may adjust. There's also a huge secondary market now with rented mining at places like ghash, knc, etc... which allows larger operations to offer mining at a premium, to pay for equipment much faster, and that pricing is less directly corelated to the cost of creating a bitcoin. If they could earn on equipment they'd simply run their own pools but it's not that simple anymore.
To put it bluntly, Bitcoin is a highly speculative global currency, not pegged to a specific value, yet determined by supply and demand on bitcoin exchanges, where price is highly dictated by large traders, and potential news/events in the space. It's much more highly manipulated by traders at this point than miners considering there's only ~3600 coins generated by mining/day. Expect further centralization and large scale mining operations to focus on this secondary market of virtual hashing power, unless somehow technology becomes cost efficient and profitable again for entry level miners.

it depends. It's a matter of convenience vs. trust. If you prefer the convenience and ease of use of one of these services, and trust them, then what they are claiming is the funds are entirely safe.
For the pro-user there are ways you can store your private keys where the only person you trust is yourself. Paper wallets, encrypted usb drives, etc etc. 
I'm not a huge fan of paper anything just my preference, I would prefer something like multiple usb drives with encrypted copies of keys, or finding safe(?) storage somewhere in the cloud and encrypting the keys because of course, we all trust Bitcoin encryption scheme, you can use it for other things. :)

Here's most of the relevant information. I don't want to do the calculation because I might be missing some detail, so someone else feel free. (it's not so much 7tps because the blocktime is variable)
* Higher transaction fees would always be accepted first, this may result in supply/demand and people raising TX fees.
* Max block size 1MB
* 50kb of free "high priority" transactions per block
* Min tx fee 0.0001 
* Max tx size &lt;1000 bytes
* current average blocksize 350 kb (
* average confirmation time 8 mins (
* 2.5x increase in overall transaction size per block would be an issue causing congestion in larger blocks and spilling over to smaller.

The vast majority of people who are not in line with Bitcoin either don't understand it, or do understand it and simply don't like it, like I don't like Blue Cheese, it's a preference. Sure there's a lot of Bitcoiners out there that hate paypal, it's an option as well hated and loved.
Also, I'm a pretty firm believer that the price rocket to 1000+ was a direct result of the centralization of Gox, and internal trading, see willy report. The price now is pretty fair given I was seeing $80-$120 for a long period before all of the crazyness.

mining at its core is utilized to maintain a distributed network of consensus, essentially creating no single point of failure and allowing all parties to agree, for instance the blockchain. In ethereum miners are paid with fees, not blockrewards, and different PoS algorithms etc are being considered.
Without some type of mining it is difficult to do decentralized network, but I think as things progress the definition of mining will change, not just raw computations.
Ether is issued at a pre-set rate computed following the crowdsale
"The annual issuance rate is 0.26x the initial quantity of ether sold, reduced from the 0.50x that had been proposed in January. We may choose later on to adopt alternative consensus strategies, such as hybrid proof of stake, so future patches may reduce the issuance rate lower. However, we make absolutely no promises of this, except that the issuance rate will not exceed 26.00% per annum of the quantity of ether sold in the Genesis Sale." -ethereum blog

Look, I'm just going to propose an easy solution to this. If you've ever used something like Adblock, or Peergaurd, you can block various addresses, or content based on it's intent. Why not just publish, Luke's list and make it an add-on to the source code you're pushing. If people like it they'll start using your list, if not that's fine too. The only way to directly filter Bitcoin transactions should be on a protocol level, at the source, if a transaction is valid by the code's design then it should be relayed, and if there is enough overwhelming consensus that those transactions are problematic then the developers can come to a point where it can be dealt with.

I don't particularly like the classification of Bitcoin 2.0. Bitcoin provides an amazing solution to consensus, that has given the basis for many projects. I think there could be a more all encompassing term used. I think it is really to make it very easy for others to understand, that it is a derivative of Bitcoin, and piggy back on the concept. For this reason, it makes it easier than saying Alternate Cryptocurrency, and Distributed Consensus based implementations.
Bitcoin itself is 2.0 of other implementations in this context.

tl;dr they don't all have to survive just the cream of the crop
We've seen crowdfunding sales like  take in funds and build a product that is decentralized, similar with alt-coins. What you're really embracing is changing the traditional investment model. VC's aren't looking to get 100% success rate, they are looking to get in on the next IPO.
VC's and accelerators know that not all their investments will pan out. You have to keep in mind the goal is to pick a few promising ventures, put effort and funds behind, and then hope that one takes off. In traditional non-btc start up land 1/15 don't make it past 2 years, but then you have an UBER, Dropbox, Heroku, Airbnb, and back to Paypal, that pays off huge. For venture capitalist it's not so much about every company succeeding but investing in a particular space and working with a number of companies. That's why you see things like 500 startups with Bitcoin companies, putting small funds in early stage hoping to win on the industry. Fintech as a whole is a very interesting proposition and I think banking in general sees great interest from Investors. It's not your next social network, it's your next payment network potentially, and that's much more profitable potentially.

the payment system itself is not risky. That is my point. If you'd like to transfer funds, and not hold bitcoin, that can be achieved, essentially, a decentralized cheaper western union. The coin itself is volatile, but even the US Dollar fluctuates day to day, we just don't see it because of it's wide adoption. All currencies actual value fluctuates do to demand, but it only effects those trading, or those converting money **EXCEPT** for places where local currency is extremely volatile. Imagine you lived in a region where putting your earnings into Bitcoin was more safe than using your local currency immediately the argument fails. This is becoming the case in some places in the world.
As a consumer using a FIAT currency in first world nations you are often abstracted from that fluctuation. The value of most currencies is not pegged to say gold, but a centralized authority and supply/demand.

1. You make the assumption you can completely trust the company and their proprietary software.

But I see after reading the latest I was incorrect, Thanks for the correction.
"Civil investigations by lawyers representing any creditors of the exchange are likely to be stonewalled due to the company’s Japanese entity, MtGox KK, having been made insolvent, under which circumstance it was granted bankruptcy protection in the United States. Should any criminal activity be unearthed, the circumstances would be considerably different, therefore the ability to bring those at fault to book would be a much easier task."

1. Let's assume you use a hosted web wallet, and preferably a wallet that doesn't capture user data. The only thing they can determine is you are using a given service provider, since the IP or transaction are not unique, it's tough especially for those service providers that don't use unique outbound addresses. 
2. Disabling Tor, this assumes you won't fall back to another node. If you properly configure Tor, you will not allow any connection excpet for Tor to run, this affects users who automatically drop back to their un-protected connection. You can also partner a VPN etc with Tor. If you stick with Tor only you can utilize a Tor specific node  rather than clearnet.

One can say it's a collaboration of Adam Back, and Hal Finney's work directly or indirectly doesn't matter where as Satoshi is more of a Linus Torvalds figure, the kernel creator, whether it's "Nick Szabo" or not. Adam really has been the most vocal long-time cypherpunk on Bitcoin, founded blockstream etc... as of late. If anything we can look at the code and say, RPOW (Hal Finney), Hash Cash (Adam Back), openssl, ecdsa, and the prior steps, bitgold, bmoney, digicash is Satoshi really one individual regardless? But, you have to think whoever worked/researched the 25 years on digital cash, couldn't walk away, if not for money the idealism. It will or has become entangled into their personal sphere, which definitely has arisen from Adam Back's latest work. I doubt Satoshi ever stopped coding, barring health issues.

the main stat that has been steadily increasing is TX's per day. This may actually be misleading as now that a number of services utilize the blockchain for non-Bitcoin currency needs, it may not directly impact price. In addition most new wallets/users start with small amounts to trade. This shows actually that the blockchain itself is increasing in value not the price of Bitcoin.
Exchange trade volume has stayed relatively consistant

Why a system that can be completely audited, with an open ledger, non-centralized and not under the control of a central authority users having control of funds to the point of being able to print out encrypted keys are fundamental rights we CAN have in this new digital-era we are entering if we choose an open system...
Bitcoin's first block holds the story that should be written, The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks. Bitcoin would be best told as a story about banking, and about the rights of the people versus a monetary system that we have all but proven does not work for everyone, especially in a global context. I think capturing the ideals of a monetary system not controlled by a central bank really speaks to everyone.

A bitcoin can be divided down to 0.00000001 there are currently ~13,000,000 in circulation. Meaning 1.3e+15 units assuming not using transaction fees.

Well I have seen some hybrid PoS/PoW coins where say 51% hashing and 51% of ownership are required for an attack. 
There are also newer mining algorithms like x13 x15 algorithm supposed to deter asic domination.
Other algorithms which are supposed to have superior power usage. 
Do you think it's just a matter of hardware catching up and becoming more efficient thus negating the power cost of the network and diversifying ownership of mining power for Bitcoin in the long run?

I'm a big believer there's room for many things. Bitcoin functions as a protocol for payments, it's a distributed ledger. Sure there is not mass adoption yet, and there is a lot that needs to be done for usability. That being said it functions really well at adding and subtracting balances in a distributed decentralized ledger that so far has continued working despite bad actors, governments, and other threats. That's where the value is.
Bitcoin is not built for distributed storage, and it doesn't make sense for such a system to mine a resource like drive space if it's function is not data storage. Mining is simply necessary at this point, although more efficient and sleak solutions are being considered.
Storj solves a different problem, distributed encrypted storage, utilizing a blockchain. Storage is incentivized because it's needed for the system. I think we need a complementary system like Storj, to solve the pieces not covered by Bitcoin. I contributed to the sale, because I think privacy and file storage on a distributed decentralized system on the blockchain is really something that compliments Bitcoin, but you have to understand the function of Bitcoin, and that it provides the most fundamental of economic needs despite attempts to stop it.

I would evaluate your taxes, and activity of selling on coinbase and do your best to be proactive if there is a discrepancy. Take it or leave it, but my rule of thumb would be show that you're attempting to do your best, and if they have issue adjust.

simple segwit can be deployed seamlessly, the only reason there is a forced feeling we need to HF at the same time is social/political. In reality, the most practical thing is to apply a patch that causes no disruption as it is ready, and then come back to the table with an HF plan.

i don't see why you'd have to use the blockchain to communicate the message. I think it's using your keypairs so you can use bitcoin addresses for messaging.

We'll need to see if Ross can generate a valid address by hand.

It's all about forging relationships with content creators, so that you can send money back for purchases. The issue really is what do people **WANT**. Demand is skewed towards major labels, and production studios. In addition most people able to figure out Bitcoin could probably figure out torrents. In my opinion, you should take your skills and develop something more unique, that isn't already being done in the centralized world. Apple allows downloads one off, without subscription for instance.
