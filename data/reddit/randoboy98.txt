I hate to be that guy, and this will probably get downvoted, but I’m actually pretty concerned that this bull run might be a fluke. I’ve been in since July 2017, but this run just doesn’t have the same energy to it. After going vertical to 13.8k, we’ve been making a series of lower highs (every subsequent pop is getting sold quicker and quicker). Also, the more times a level gets tested, the more likely it is to break. I view 9500-10000 as a level that may be getting ready to break. And when it does, it could get ugly. Again, I’m in bitcoin and obviously would very much like it to continue a real run up to new highs. Just my two cents on the price action over the last couple weeks.

My theory on the recent bitcoin price action: As bitcoin has been looking somewhat weak since the blow off from 13.8k, many big players have been spending the past month accumulating large short positions. So if bitcoin does start to rally and push towards highs, we will see an absolutely massive short squeeze as all of those institutions/whales are forced to rush to cover their shorts. This will add even more buying pressure on top of the FOMO buyers and could send us on the true parabolic move to ATHs. At least that’s what I hope is happening as someone that owns bitcorn

Look it up. I’m in the US, so I can’t without a vpn, but I know there are a few options for exchanges that allow you to short

Shorting bitcoin definitely is possible.

I’m honestly not sure, but it’s 100% happening. Everyone remembers the sell off from December 2017 and big players want to catch the next crash. Im sure that there are hundreds of millions of dollars in short positions on bitcoin right now.
Also, Shorts and Liquidations sounds like a shitty financial spin off of Parks and Recreation lol

It’s for poker reasons not bitcoin reasons. Don’t just downvote me so that I can’t get an answer lol

What happened to the “bitcoin is inversely correlated to the market” theorists?
