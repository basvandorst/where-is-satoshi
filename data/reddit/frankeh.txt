Small hit at most. This has been a long time coming, and should be well factored in at this point. There'll be some slight panic, but it's not going to cause the sky to fall in the Eurozone.

But it seems to me that the people who don't have basic money management skills are the exact people the banks should be helping, not penalizing. A bank is meant to help you manage your money, not laugh at you and deduct $30 each time you make a mistake.. 
Here in the UK:
* Personal bank accounts are free. No minimum balance or anything. 
* 66,700 ATM's that are free to use, regardless of who you bank with
* Chip and pin
* Arranged overdrafts with sensible low fees
* Unarranged overdrafts with slightly higher fees
* Instant payments to whoever, regardless of if you use the same bank. 
And probably a bunch of other shit I take for granted and don't even think about. 
If we can do it there's zero reason the USA can't. A few of the things there were legislated for.. We told them it had to be done if they wanted to still operate as a bank, and they did it.

Lol, read that back a few times until you realise why what you said is stupid. 


A contract isn't justification. I can draft up a contract that says you have to pay me $500 each time you say the word 'And'.. If you sign it, is that $500 fee for each time you say the word 'And' justifiable? No.
That's it taken to the extreme, but the same applies. Just because something is how it is, doesn't mean it's how it should be. $30+ for EACH TRANSACTION is absurd. They're purposely trying to extract as much money as possible from their poorest customers. It's disgusting, and should be legislated against.


Since when is 12% APR 'free'? Where'd you learn to read? 
Plus it's arranged. You agree with the bank.. It just acts as a flexible loan for emergencies, and it works very well. 
I mean [have a gander..](
Doesn't that seem a lot nicer than $35 every time you do a transaction with no money in your account?
@_date: 2015-06-18 10:23:08
'How can I give all my money to middle class Americans?' 
@_date: 2015-06-26 17:20:13
Just arrange an agreed overdraft with your bank? I have a £2,000 overdraft arranged with my bank so I can go up to £2,000 a month into the red and only incur 1% fees. 
So if I was £2,000 in the red for the entire month I'd have to pay them £20. 
Realistically I'm never more than £200 in the red, and only usually for a fraction of the month. I pay pennies in fees. 
Arranged overdrafts are good sense even if you don't plan to use it, because otherwise shit like this happens. 
**Edit:** Apparently arranged overdrafts barely exist in the USA (WTF?), but I've found a bank for anyone interested that does handle them like we do in the UK. Capital One 360 checking account. 
**Edit2:** You should really be writing to your representatives about this. There's absolutely no good justification for charging $30+ per transaction for overdrafts.. It's robbery. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:55:35

Lol, what costs? It's 2015, not 1915.. No one does anything. No man hours are spent frantically trying to find $1.50 for that coke you just bought.. It's just numbers in a database. 
$30 isn't indicative of the costs the bank incurs on overdrafts. You know how I know? Because our banks charge less in the UK. A lot less. Even unarranged overdraft fees max out at £5-6 per day, unlimited transactions. 
So it can and is being done elsewhere. The only reason banks aren't doing it in the USA is because they have people like you defending their predatory practices.

For disclosure I own 0.00x btc that I was tipped. Although I have no idea how to use it, claim it or whatever. 
I think I have ~1000 dogecoin somewhere too. Same story, was tipped it and it's somewhere in the ether. 
Basically, I've never bought any and I don't care about the ones I was given. Certainly not enough to be pumping them. 


And the problem is that there's so many people now invested in the bitcoin protocol that no one would really willingly shake the boat too much. I *think* sidechains are meant to solve this 'problem' but lets face it, all they do is allow bitcoiners to cash in on the innovation of other implementations of cryptocurrency without taking any of the risk. It's all a cash grab, as usual. 
The first cryptocurrency I'll be investing in is zerocoin/cash or whatever they decide to call it as I believe it's more like what was promised with bitcoin a few years ago. Completely anonymous payments.

You'd end up in a situation where companies had a monopoly on trust, which would mean the whole marketplace would be less competitive. 
At the moment I can just send my money to whoever is the cheapest and not need to worry about trust. If they fuck me, I can do a charge back and then buy from somewhere else.. 
In a trust based system where I have to trust the merchant why would I risk going for the cheaper no name merchant for, say a $50 saving, when I could go with Amazon for $50 more because I know I won't get ripped off. 
I lose out on $50, the no name merchant loses a sale, Amazon wins. 
Basically, the economy is not a winner in this scenario.

This is the only document listed at companies house for the company:

If you invested before march (when the company was incorporated) and you're not on that list of shareholders then they've fucked you good an proper and you likely have no legal stake to shit. Or at least not without a lot of lawyers getting involved and you having to make a case. 
Officially, you are not a shareholder in the company unless:

This is such a bullshit line of reasoning. 
The intricacies of how Bitcoin works is completely irrelevant to the consumer. The consumer should be able to see why Bitcoin is beneficial to them without it being explained in great detail. 
How many people do you think fly on passenger jets each year? Do you think they understand the intricacies of how a passenger jet works? Fuck no. They don't know and they don't care. 
The only important bit is that it allows them to go from one place to another place, really fast. 
By and large the consumer won't care what happens in between. The product is getting them from one place to another, fast. 
They don't want to know how jet engines work, they don't want to know the physics behind lift. It's all completely irreverent to them. Just like the intricacies of Bitcoin are. 
Tell the average consumer what Bitcoin can actually do, and they'll be extremely unimpressed.

It's a cost of doing business, yes. It'll be factored into the price. 
But there's more to eCommerce than just raw price of a product. 
For example would you buy a $2000 TV from Amazon using bitcoin if they let you? Yeah, you probably would because the trust is there and they have a good reputation..
Now, would you buy the same TV for $1800 from cooltv.freewebs.com? No, you wouldn't. Because you can't trust that you'll actually make that $200 saving and you might even lose the entire $1800 to them. 
However with paypal, for example, you don't have to give much of a fuck. Take a gamble on the $1800 TV on the untrustworthy site and it might pay off. If it doesn't, claim the money back. 
Now, lets say the sale goes fine. Your understandable reluctance to use the site was ultimately unwarranted. You saved $200, and the merchant using paypal made a sale. That's a $200 risk you might not have taken with Bitcoin. 
Winners all around.

This trust issue has been solved for at least the past decade. The solution was to not trust individual site owners with your card details and instead trust one site with your card details and then let that site dispense your money. Paypal, square, worldpay, etc all work this way. You're being disingenuous claiming that that's really a problem nowadays. 


Apart from the huge bulk of Bitcoin users are westerners since westerners are generally the only people with the infrastructure needed to actually use bitcoins in the way that's promoted around these parts. 3G minimum, smart phones in every pocket, the education to understand how bitcoin works.. 
And when those countries get to that level of infrastructure, the banking system will follow. 
It's a catch 22. The people that could *maybe* benefit the most from Bitcoin are the ones that aren't equipped to use it. And as soon as they are equipped to use it, it's likely their banking system will have improved significantly to the point where they don't need bitcoin.

Presumably NeoBee will take a cut somewhere along the line, otherwise their business plan stinks. 
What's their cut? 
I know in the UK the average card processing fee for a physical store is 0.9%. Are they going to come in much lower than that? 
In the end, even if they charge nothing it's just 0.9% on average..  I'd rather have all the things that 0.9% affords me such as chargebacks, consumer protection, yadda yadda. Plus I already have a bank account, credit card and debit card and have for years. Why rock the boat when the advantages are so negligible?

There is no difference, imo. People only claim there's a difference because they're attempting to hide behind an antiquated legal system that hasn't caught up with technology. 
Intellectual property is property. It takes money, effort and skill to create. Those people should be rewarded *however they see fit* for selling their intellectual property. 
Imagine this hypothetical. 
A man carves a beautiful chair out of a solid piece of oak. Original design, expertly crafted. Cost him a lot of money in materials and he spent a lot of time on it. 
Now, a guy comes along with a replicator and zaps his chair, then makes 1,000,000 copies of it and gives them away for free. 
No one wants to buy the mans chair for £10,000 now because they can get a free replicated copy. 
The act of copying his property has devalued his work until it's worth almost nothing. 
That's essentially what piracy is.  The only difference is that for music and movies we managed to invent the replicator technology. That doesn't make it okay.

I'm literally going to need to get the crayons out in a minute. 
Okay, let me use a simple example. 
I ask you to participate in a competition to find the cheapest Sony 32 inch TV on the internet. 
It's only sold on Amazon.com, MomnPop.com and Overtock.com. 
Amazon.com has it for $250
Overstock.com has it for $220
Momnpop.com has it for $215
To win the competition, which site do you give as your example. You choose momnpop.com because they have it for the cheapest price, and the competition was to find it for the cheapest price on the internet. 
The competition wasn't to find it for the cheapest price on Amazon.
The fact momnpop.com doesn't do 1/10000000 of the volume of sales that Amazon does is completely irrelevant. The end result is the same. The cheapest TV.

I disagree that you have to look at it in percentage terms. 
No one had the kind of sums that we're seeing invested nowadays when the price was $32. The average investment was almost certainly much lower. People were still mining on graphics cards for goodness sake. 
There were multiple screen shots the other day on here where people were showing that they were buying $1000 a month. How often was that happening at $32? It wasn't even possible to set up an automated buy IIRC. The services didn't exist. Buying Bitcoin was a total pain in the ass.

Absurd. With enough disruption to the consumer, they could be made 100% safe. 
Issue a hardware token and require the user to put in the number generated by the token when paying. 
It's a huge pain in the arse, though. 
Here in the UK we have 3D secure which means you put in your card details, click pay, then you're forwarded to another page from your bank where you put in certain letters of your password, then it authorizes. This cut down on fraud a huge amount. The system also allows for one time passwords to be sent in an SMS, but my bank doesn't use that feature. That would be full two factor authentication though and as near as matters bulletproof.

It doesn't work like that. 
You log into your banking app, select a contact in your phones contacts, Enter amount and click send. Then your bank goes around to other banks and tries to match the phone number on file to a bank account number and sort code on file. If it finds a match, it initiates the transfer.

People on here always recommend letting banks fail, to the detriment of depositors. Surely not letting them fail, to the detriment of investors, will make for a more stable system.

Namecoin, Zerocoin, etc. Those are innovating, and I don't have a bad word to say about either. 
My problem is not with the blockchain technology, or cryptocurrency in general. It's entirely with the over hyped and over pumped bitcoin variant which, in my opinion, only has the amount of attention it has because so many people are heavily invested it in, and not because it actually does anything significantly better than anything else..
In my opinion, there's been next to no innovation within bitcoin for the last year or so. It's taken steps back.. Its killer app (silkroad) is now dead and the alternatives that emerged blow..
I wouldn't stick around here if I thought the entire idea was complete shit.

But if you buy up a lot of coins you might accidentally stop someone else who was important to the progression of bitcoin owning some. 
What if you bought the coins that Ulbricht bought that got him interested in bitcoin? So he never created Silk Road. So Bitcoin never got that springboard platform to launch off of. 
I don't think you could make high enough returns from your initial investment without possibly altering the path bitcoin took for the worse (or maybe better, who knows)..

There is no monthly bill.. I can cancel the £12 a month whenever I want. As long as I have a £0 balance or over in my bank account I won't get any fees and my bank account will remain open. 
Obviously if I lost my job I'd have a bit more to contend with as my landlord, phone provider, internet provider, etc would start coming after me but that's nothing to do with banks and you'd have the exact same situation if bitcoin was the norm. 


Not true. That assumes that all those actions actually require to bank to expend money and/or effort.. In reality they don't at all or rather it's completely negligible. Tenths of a penny, maybe? A transfer from one bank to another is just computers doing their shit.. No person is involved and all the systems are automated nowadays. It doesn't cost the bank shit, so they don't charge for it.

Basically, you know how banks take your deposits and invest a percentage of them in securities, bonds, stocks, etc and then pay you a nominal amount of interest and then pocket the rest of the gains?

Allegedly Josh actually broke the terms of the sale, so it's likely if bordercontrol could afford the legal fees he could get it back. Josh said he'd not change anything and that bordercontrol could still work for the site and write articles.

Assuming that they're collecting interest on their deposits, I'd argue they are part of that group. 
It's a sliding scale, and they're just about on the bottom of it in my mind. People with 100,000 euros or more will generally have put a lot of thought into which bank account to use. Enough thought to demonstrate due diligence, imo. The pleb with 1000 euros in his account probably just opened it because it was the first one he got to on his high street! 
I'm somewhat trivializing it, but I hope you understand what I'm getting at. 
I think we have a fundamentally different view, though. I see depositors as investors, to an extent. And you don't. I can certainly understand where you're coming from.

The point of a dictatorship is everyone answers to one man and he has all the power. 
If there's someone corrupt, and he finds out/is told, he fires them and strips them of all their possessions and puts them in prison. 
That's the good thing with a dictatorship, no pesky trials if you can't be bothered. Obviously keep fair trials for the general populace.. But in the end you have all the power.

Not only that, but there's also other costs associated with using rebit.ph if you're just some guy who doesn't give a fuck about Bitcoin but wants to send money back home to the Philippines. AKA, most people using remittance services. 
It's not just 1%. It's 1% plus however much it costs to buy Bitcoins.

Does it matter at all in practice? Citizens rarely keep huge reserves of dollars, if they have them. They instead invest in companies and new ventures as a way to stop their money being eroded away by inflation. 
To the average wage slave, the amount the dollar loses in value each years means nothing as generally their employer will increase their wage by that much. And if they don't, eventually the government raises the minimum wage a bit to give them a nudge. 
Is there really any solid economic argument for wanting people to keep their money doing nothing? Just sitting in the bank stagnating? Adding nothing to society.

Sure, with fiat the first to get their hands on the newly made money do stand to benefit first but at least the average joe does benefit eventually..

But the problem is that it's a merchant benefit at the *expense* of the consumers. And that's not a good thing. That a severe negative for me, and I imagine just about any consumer. 
At the end of the day, the consumer is always right. The merchant wants the consumers money, so it must play by the consumers rules. That's just business, and bitcoin isn't going to change that. 
I just don't understand why your average person, ideology be damned, would take a step backwards like that. Why would they give up easily being able to claw their money back if a merchant fucks them over for those benefits you mentioned. It just doesn't seem realistic to me.

You don't have to trust the merchant. That's the entire advantage of paypal..

So it's just my bank and paypal I need to trust, and paypal has more than earned my trust and I wouldn't be using my bank if I didn't trust them.


What are you talking about? So because you're using bitcoin the merchant **has** to deliver your goods, for, er, maths and reasons.

All markets run on emotion, not trends. Trends (as plotted on graphs, at least) mean absolutely nothing.. Bitcoin is no different.

I really don't think you're understanding what I'm saying, and I'm not sure how to explain it any better. Lets try removing dollars from the equation. 
So, I want to buy a bag of potatos for 1BTC. I borrow 1BTC from Natwest Bank and agree to pay back 1.1BTC in a years time. 
The problem is, now a year is up and 1BTC is actually enough to buy 1.5 bags of potatos. So I'm now paying back way more (in value terms) than I originally borrowed. Then on top of that I also have to pay back the 0.1BTC interest. 
It's like paying two lots of interest on a loan. Only an idiot would do that.

I've lost count of the amount of people who've said they've cashed out their initial investment on here. That's the paying off of old investment.

The thing is, why would banks ever bother with bitcoin? There's already an international and industry standard for instant payments. It's called SWIFT and it's over 30 years old. 
The problem comes when the message hits the bank (almost instantly) and then they take their sweet time processing it. 
Rather than adopt bitcoin, they could simply improve their internal procedures when it comes to SWIFT and have instant and cheap payments. 
~8-15 cents per transfer. 
It's not a lack of technology, it's a lack of will. And Bitcoin won't magically make banks pull their fingers out. 
Here in the UK we just created 'The Payment Services Regulations 2009' and regulation 70 is:


Basically requiring banks to do transfers in less than a day. The banks used this as justification to just make them instant, since if you're forced to upgrade your system anyway then you might as well make it instant.
So now we have instant payments domestically, which are 100% free.  
Fixing slow and expensive payments is a job for regulation, not bitcoin. Which is hugely ironic given the political leanings of this subreddit..

Satoshi could have the same effect on bitcoin by just shifting his coins about, though. Doesn't seem like Bitcoin specifically solves this problem, but rather has transferred such control to some mysterious entity.

Just remember that people on here own Bitcoin and therefore have a vested interest in promoting Bitcoin to new people. The more Bitcoin users there are, the more their stash of Bitcoins is worth. So for them, upvoting any criticism of Bitcoin is actively fighting against their own investment. It leads to an intense echo chamber.

1) The technology to do cheap payments already exists and is in wide use. In the UK bank transfers domestically are completely free and instant, for example. The only think keeping payments expensive is banks wanting to make money. Bitcoin won't change that.. There will always be people trying to make money. 
Look at coinbase as an example. 1% for both the consumer and the merchant. 
2) If you want to pay for something using Bitcoin then you need to have access to your private keys in one form or another. That's the whole point. If you can access them, you can give them up.

For the everyman, what incentive is there to adopt bitcoin when it'll cost them more? That's the argument he's making and I think you're being obtuse by pretending his argument was somehow meant to apply to people who've managed to mine/earn bitcoin. They're the extreme minority.

They weren't 'giving' them away because that implies permission. There was no permission for what happened. If Mt Gox realised what was happening, they'd have stopped it.

You got the maths right but your knowledge of the industry completely wrong. Everything is negotiable especially if you say to everyone involved 'We won't argue fraud.' which netflix can. The per transaction fee will also be very negotiable when you're looking at the volumes netflix is. Netflix takes in around 40,000,000 payments a month from just as many subscribers. I'd be extremely shocked if their processing fees are even 1% total.

FYI, this happened with my Mum and Dad. I think it's a more common attitude than one might think. 
Mum died, Dad took her insurance policy and sold the house. Kicked me out of the house and went to live in some other country. We never saw him again. 
We found a draft of the will and next to the bit that says 'everything goes to my husband' it said 'What about the children?' so it seems it was clear to me that there'd been some verbal agreement between the two as to what would happen. She was young, so I doubt death was seriously on either of their minds. 
What I'm trying to say, is that to anyone reading this make sure your will is exactly what you want to happen when you die. Don't trust anyone as money is a fucking bitch and changes people. Write exactly what you want to happen down.

It's be even worse because my $29.99 worth of bitcoin I had to buy to do the bet would then only be worth $14.98 and then I'd win $14.98.. So I'd break even when I win if the price halved.

Fiat is free to transfer and accept too. It's only the systems built around fiat that charge, and that'll happen with Bitcoin too. 


And yet the vast majority of companies accepting bitcoin choose to use a third party.. 


A small amount of inflation is good for the economy. And can you really say no inflation while:
1) Bitcoin supply is inflating.
2) It's lost something crazy like 2/3rds of its value in a year.
I mean, if I were to have the choice against the £ which had lost ~1.6% of its value this year because of inflation or Bitcoin which has lost ~66% of its value this year because..... Because it just has. 
I think I know which I'd choose. 
At least I can look at the governments monetary policy, the state of the economy, etc and understand why what's happening is happening.

Because by and large bitcoin doesn't matter. 
In real markets there's plenty that can happen in the 14 hours of closed markets that can heavily effect stock prices and the desirability of a stock/commodity. 
Obviously this doesn't apply to you personally because you've bought into the unfortunate cult mentality that the bitcoin community fosters. 
But for professional traders, I'm sure they're happy that they can take 14 hours off a day from watching their computer screens without worrying that they're going to wake up to a decimated portfolio. 
At least with markets closing it means everyone is on fair footing when bad news is announced. At 8am, everyone gets to make their decision and put it into action.

Sure, but what about big purchases. A $1,999 TV, for example. 
Some little no name site has it for $1,899 and Amazon has it for $1,999. Do I risk $1,899 on the little merchant to potentially save $100? Or do I just go with Amazon because I trust them? 
I go with Amazon, because it'd be insane to risk $1,899 to potentially save $100.

All I really think when people use kickstarter is more fool them. I always just wait for the product to be released and then buy. I'm not in the investment business, I'm just a consumer. I want to pay money for a product, not pay money for the promise of a product if everything goes right. 
I'd be well up for kickstarter if dividends were given. But apparently the laws are pretty tight around that.. 
I don't think bitcoin will help in that regard either. In the end the technology to crowdsource business start up funding has been around for ages, but the political will isn't there to allow it.

It's just such an absurd premise to me. There's no way in hell bitcoin is anywhere near as revolutionary as those things. In fact, it requires each and every one of those things to even exist.  
Bitcoin just isn't the big shit people are making it out to be, I'm afraid. It'll probably never ever go away, but it'll also never become what you're expecting it to become. 
It'll remain fringe. It doesn't solve a problem that most people actually give a flying fuck about. It might not solve any problems at all, if you're asking me. It certainly brings a lot of them into the mix.

The rules are set out in the original post. 
I could have easily picked a country that has no bitcoin exchange and no bitcoin remittance service. But I didn't. I picked the Philippines to be fair to Bitcoin. 
I'm not going to randomly select an uncompetitive remittance service to pit against Bitcoin in a remittance scenario that already favours Bitcoin. 
If you really want to open up the ENTIRE remittance market to this comparison then even the uncompetitive pricing of WU will dick all over Bitcoin in 99% of remittance examples simply because there's over a hundred countries that don't have a bitcoin remittance service but do have WU in their country.. Instant win for WU since there's no Bitcoin competitor.. 
So I'm just playing by the rules of the thread I set up. I'm being VERY fair to bitcoin here, and you're still trying to make this seem like some attack.

I don't deny that bitcoin to bitcoin is pretty frictionless, but it just doesn't have anywhere near the everyday utility of fiat. Not yet, at least. 
Any without an edge over fiat, why adopt it? It has fringe uses (I've used it once for buying hard to find drugs online) and it'll probably keep those fringe userbases unless something more anonymous comes along (Zerocash/coin?)
The thing is, people in here are shouting about the moon but as the author quite rightly says there's really not much reason for anyone to use it at the moment for things they'd usually use cash for. The benefits aren't there.

Different situations, different services work better. And on top of that, this thread has nothing to with WU. It's about remittances in general. 
This thread, if anything, shows that there's a lot more cost involved in remittance using the Bitcoin service sector than is being claimed in those spoof WU bitcoin ads. 
And that's all I really wanted to show.

Bitcoin girl: Yep!
Prospective customer: So where do I sign up? 
Bitcoin girl: That's the great thing, you don't need to sign up. You just need to download a bitcoin client for free and get some bitcoins. 
Prospective customer: This is amazing. So how do I get Bitcoins?
Bitcoin girl: Well you buy them from exchanges. 
Prospective customer: At 1 cent per Bitcoin? 
Bitcoin girl: Well no, it's actually more like 0.5-1% per Bitcoin.
Prospective customer: .... Okay, that's not exactly the 1 cent you said earlier but it's still cheaper than WU. So I can just send the bitcoins for 1% + 1 cent and then my mum in the Philippines can pick it up from a local Bitcoin affiliate? 
Bitcoin girl: Well, no. Not exactly. 
Prospective customer: What do you mean not exactly? 
Bitcoin girl: Your mum will receive Bitcoins.

Not true. Centralized, if built correctly, will always be faster and more consistent than a P2P system because you have control over everything. Hardware, software, locale, bandwidth, etc.. It's all under your control. 
All you get from P2P is redundancy which generally also goes hand in hand with increased costs. 
You might not see the cost, because some other sucker is paying for it.. But the cost still exists. 
I'm very certain that the bitcoin network currently costs more per month to maintain than paypal pays to maintain their infrastructure, and they do insanely more (real) volume than bitcoin does.

You really can't beat the walled garden when it comes to reliability. It's nice not having to worry about shoddy programming interfering with my phones core function (being a phone).. 
That's just me though. If you want to use your phone like a computer (and have all the hassle that goes with that) then Android is probably for you. 
If you just want a reliable phone/camera/internet browser that does some cool shit as well then Apple seems like the best bet. 
Oh, and one thing people aren't mentioning is support.. Android updates are few and far between. As soon as the next model is out you can pretty much expect a few months until they stop supporting your model.

I've been on this sub since early 2013. I've always been wary of Bitcoin from the very start, but 6 months ago decided I should at least give it a go (and my mates were hassling me to buy them something) so I did. 
Most of my preconceptions I'd gained in the year and a half beforehand were pretty much confirmed. But at least I gave it a go. Maybe I'll give it another go mid 2015 and see if it's getting easier. I know a few things will be easier. 
I'll probably never be convinced that there's a use case for Bitcoin beyond the darkmarkets, though. Price fluctuation guarantees that, imo. It's a cost of business on the darkmarkets where there's not much choice, but for everyday ecommerce there's established systems in place that do the job a lot more consistently.

I trust that my doctor won't give me drugs that will kill me. I trust my friends will turn up to where we agree to meet. 
Life is a bleak and horrible thing when you don't trust anyone. We're social animals, and that's how we've come to completely dominate the earth. 
Even with bitcoin you need trust. You send the bitcoin to some guy and then you trust that he'll send you the product. The trust isn't gone, it's just been transferred. Now you have to trust businesses rather than businesses having to trust you. And that's assbackwards.

You can't really separate the two when it comes to Bitcoin. 


That's a fair observation, but as you said it's something both systems deal with. I'd give the UK commercial banking system the win for that though since the fee is completely removed, and the ease of use is way about that of Bitcoin. I also think that the per transaction cost is way way lower with the traditional banking system than Bitcoin is with its block reward subsidizing transaction costs.

No it doesn't. It never did. It's always confused me that anyone would buy into this shit. 
Their business plan in their prospectus required at least a 5% increase in bitcoin per month to become profitable next year. 
It's no shock why they burnt through their bitcoins when there was a 20% dip in bitcoin price. They had no contingency for if bitcoin went down in price, and this is the result of it. 
Many people, including myself, warned of this when they opened their shop and people didn't listen. 
You're throwing good money after old with NeoBee. Stay the fuck away. 
If the business plan requires that bitcoin rises in price to make a profit, and you believe that the business plan will work.. Then that means you believe that bitcoin will increase in value and you'd be better off just keeping your damn bitcoins and watching them increase in value.  
Stop being a tard and stop getting fooled by fancy looking shop fronts and crisp looking advertising material. NeoBee is smoke and mirrors.

I only use bitcoin when it offers a clear advantage over the current system in place. I would not bother using bitcoin on a normal ecommerce site, and I wouldn't use it to buy a dell. I'd stick with paypal, most likely. Why would I give up 120 days of consumer protection for no good reason? Especially when buying a dell. 
I've only actually purchased bitcoins and used them once, and that was to buy drugs online. 
In that transaction bitcoin demonstrated a unique and clear advantage and offered a feature that couldn't be offered by the traditional banking system/card network. 
Bitcoin needs a killer app if it ever wants to get me seriously using it. Simply playing catch up with paypal isn't a killer app. It's pretty much the bare minimum it should be managing. Even if Amazon started accepting it, I wouldn't care. It'd still not be bitcoins killer app.

This is why I think it's ridiculous when Bitcoiners talk about the 'trustless' nature of Bitcoin. 
I did a trustless Bitcoin transaction in the purest sense, in that I didn't know the real name or address of anyone I was sending money to. 
I first wired £60 to some guy on localbitcoins.com to get something like 0.25BTC back from him. 
Trust involved there. He could have simply not sent the BTC and I'd have been shit out of luck. 
Then I transferred the Bitcoins to Agora Marketplace. Trust involved there. I had to trust that today wouldn't be the day they run off with everyones funds. 
Then I bought some LSD off some guy on there, and I had to trust he'd deliver. Although Agora escrow was an option, but then I'm back to trusting Agora.. A completely unknown entity. 
So that was my first experience of Bitcoin and a purchase has never been so nerve racking. 
Bullshit is Bitcoin trustless. It requires way more trust at each stage than any other purchase I've done. I use paypal for most purchases and that's essentially just a centralization of trust. I trust paypal to give me my money back if the merchant doesn't deliver, so I never have to trust any ecommerce store I do business with. 
This means I can shop around and buy from the sketchiest sites on the web if the price is right.. If they deliver, great. I got the product cheap. If they don't, then I make a claim with paypal and get my money back. No harm done. 
If I had to do every purchase like I had to with Agora Marketplace, I'd just stick to companies that already have built up a lot of trust like Amazon. And then I have to make the choice. Do I buy that TV from Amazon who I trust for £1200 or do I buy it from Mom&amp;Pop.com for £1000 but I might lose the entire £1000 just to try and save £200... 
Net loss, to me as the consumer.

I'm currently looking at merchant accounts while pondering over a business idea I've had. 
Here in the UK the merchant account I want to use offers 15p per transaction along with 40p per debit card transaction and 1.99% on credit card transactions.. 
At my predicted average order price, we're talking at £1 at most via credit card and obviously 55p per debit card. 
It's dirt cheap already, and honestly I've not really been shopping around. That merchant+gateway just offers the features I want more than anything. If I was going for price along I'm pretty sure I could shave some money off. 
Any saving bitcoin offers could be achieved by talking with my suppliers and working something out. The cost savings seriously aren't worth the effort unless you know you're specifically going to be targeting Bitcoiners with your business. And the demographic I will want to target is about as far away from the Bitcoin crowd as could possibly be. 
I also think implementing it will confuse shoppers at checkout.
This is LETHAL. Abandoned carts are a huge issue, and tons is being done to attempt to make the checkout process as simple as possible. It's amazing how much a shitty checkout experience can decide if an order goes through or now. 
On top of that I'll **maybe** save 2% on a very small fraction of my customers orders.
We're talking a few quid a month, at best. It's just not worth it.  
You could maybe make the chargeback argument, but there's no way I'll be running a bitcoin only business so anyone who wants to use a stolen credit card will still be able to use one. 
Since my business is a physical item business, I don't expect many fraudulent transactions anyway.

You're not removing that infrastructure, though. You're distributing it elsewhere. 
Miners cost money to run. 
Also, the speed of transfers is just because there's a lack of standardization in the financial industry, and lots of regulation. Something they've been actively trying to fix over the past 15 years. 
For example, here in the UK there's a lot of standardization. That's why when I transfer money from my Natwest account to my sisters Barclays account it's instant and free. 
When they've sorted it between countries (and they will) it'll almost certainly be more efficient than the bitcoin network since they'll be working on a system of trust which means less hardware redundancy.

It's not? Bitpay who is the largest payment processor for bitcoin has done $100m this year in payments. 
By comparison, paypal does three times that PER DAY. 
Even if we pretend for a moment that coinbase is also doing $100m a year (lol) in merchant payments that's still only $200m a year in payments to merchants. 
That's still just 66% of what paypal does in a **single day**.. 
Now we look at bitcoins market cap which is around $10bn. 
We can't look at paypals market cap because it's part of ebay inc, but ebay inc's market cap is $68bn..
So how the hell does Bitcoin have an apparent $10bn market cap (17th that of Ebay inc) when it's hundreds of times less useful.

And what about advances in art, or drama, music, comedy, or any other non STEM based intelligence. 
Like I said, there's many types of intelligence. Someone might be good at maths, but they might be awful at making friends and talking to people. That shows good maths intelligence and poor social intelligence. 
Likewise someone might be shite at maths but make friends easily and is good at interacting with people. 
That shows low maths intelligence but a high amount of social intelligence. 
There's plenty of things IQ tests don't account for.

Their business plan is extremely shaky. I have no idea how they've managed to raise almost $6m in start up capital when their whole plan completely relies on the price of bitcoin rising. 'Investors' might as well have just held onto their bitcoins.

Controversial things get debated. Very few people find money creation as something that is debatable. Same with the living wage.. Not many people believe it's worth a debate. Do you really want people who don't care/don't think something is worth debating to be part of the debate? How would that help?
MP's wages are very debatable, especially when MP's themselves were pushing austerity and wage freezes across the public sector. 
The use of that image is actually really disingenuous because [the majority of the MP's and all the party leaders came out **against** a pay rise..]( 
And [here's the article the image is from, published the same day..](
In fact, MP's wages aren't even decided by MP's any more. Since 2009 an independent body called IPSA has been responsible for deciding how much to pay MP's. 
Despite the majority of MP's opposing the rise to £74,000 per year IPSA ignored them and are going ahead with raising it anyway. 
And besides, this is how the commons looks a lot of the time. MP's have duties outside of parliament, and some would argue those are their most important duties. 
It's very unusual for all MP's to show up in the commons. Only time it really happens is when the Prime Minster [recalls parliment]( 
So yeah. Those images are only shocking to people who don't have a clue.

No, I don't think that's a fair comparison. Apple has about the right number of vocal fanboys considering that they're the most valuable company in the world and you can pretty much ask 3 people on the street if they own an apple product and at least one will say yes. 
Bitcoin on the other hand has equally vocal fanboys singing its praises, but is a lot less relevant to just about everyone. 
Bitcoin allegedly has an active userbase of about 800K-1M people from the articles I've read. 
Reddit had 114,943,104 unique users visit last month... How relevant do you feel bitcoin is likely to be to them, compared to apple?

Is there a better example of remittances using Bitcoin? I just did the maths.
[Send £500 to Kenya using BitPesa]( and my Kenyan mate gets 72,258 Kenyan whatevers. 
Then I went to Western Unions site and did the [same calculation]( and my mate in Kenya would get 72,520.66 Kenyan whatevers. 
So on a £500 spend, my mate in Kenya gets 262.66 more Kenyan whatevers when using Western Union. And in reality, if you start off having no bitcoins, then you can subtract another 1-2% for exchange fees from the BitPesa numbers..

Online transactions aren't particularly hard in the first place. Ask someone on here what it's like to buy online with a card and you'd get responses that make out like it's almost as hard and fraught with danger as breaking Enigma. 
Ask your average person how hard they find it and they'll tell you not very. 
If you have paypal, it's generally 1 click, a password, and then another click. 
If you don't, then you just have to put in your card details which most people don't have a problem with at all. Hell, Chrome stores them for you nowadays to make it even easier. 
I am of course talking about 'The West' here.. There are other countries who can't do it with such ease, but who gives a fuck? Clearly there's not enough money in those countries for Visa/Mastercard/Etc.. Why would there be enough money there for bitcoin to succeed?

Ok, I have an apple and I sell it for 1 cent. The price goes up 1000% and I now sell it for 11 dents. 
Easily affordable, right? Still not an absurd price for an apple. 
Now I put up the price another 1000%. It was fine last time. No customers minded the 1000% increase. Now it's $1.21 for the apple.
Would you still buy that apple? Hell no, that's a terrible deal.

I'm in the UK and my friends sent me money for a holiday I booked for us all. It was free and instant, even though some of them use a different bank to me. 
This is because in ~2007 the government got sick of banks fucking customers over by keeping consumers money in limbo (and earning interest, or rather not paying it) during transfers. So they created legislation that required all banks to process and clear all transfers same working day. 
The banks made it instant instead since they were forced to do it anyway. It's called the faster payment service (FPS). 
So banks being costly and shit isn't a technological problem, it's a lack of will. 
And the easiest way to encourage banks to do the right thing is with legislation.

There is more of a trust issue than with Paypal, since you can't do a chargeback with bitcoin. 
Using paypal to buy something from a no name site means you only have to trust paypal, who are a huge and generally consumer friendly business. 
Using bitcoin to buy something from a no name site means you have to trust the no name site directly.

Define 'wasted'.. There's a bunch of government services here in the UK that I don't directly use but that benefits me indirectly. 
Housing allowance for the poor keeps them off the street where they'd undoubtedly beg me for money. 
NHS keeps the customers for my business alive so they can buy shit from me. 
Roads allow my family to come visit me and my packages to be delivered cheaply and promptly.
The national pension system stops old people dying in droves and gives me (a small amount of) peace of mind about my future. 
The schools keep everyone around me acceptably educated so I don't constantly have to deal with (many) morons in day to day life. 
The fire service stops my family and my customers houses burning down. 
Etc. 
Just because I don't directly use any of those services (a lot of the time) doesn't mean they're not worth paying for.

I did a quick search of my gmail. 
I've used worldpay 3 times in the past year, sagepay once, amazon payments twice and paypal a dickload of times. I've never used square, and I think google wallet was discontinued?  
I still routinely see worldpay and sagepay as an option on websites, though. I just pick paypal over either of them because paypal already has my card details. 
I mean, in 2007 WorldPay processed 4.4 billion transactions... Not sure what it's market share is now but it's clear there have been other payment processors in the marketplace other than paypal.

Completely on board with you there, and as I said above for illegal purchases Bitcoin is most likely as good as we're going to get. I don't doubt that. 
But a lot of the proponents on this subreddit see it as taking over from credit cards/debit cards, and I just can't see it for the reasons listed above. Not so much the localbitcoins bit, as that's mostly been sorted now. But the trust bit. 
A paypal for Bitcoin with a mediation service and a holding of merchant funds for 30 days or something would sort this out, but the Bitcoin community as a whole rallies against centralization. You're your own worst enemy, sometimes.

In practice though, it was as near as matters a pre mine. We can argue semantics until the cows come home, of course.

@_date: 2014-12-10 18:07:42
I feel pretty qualified to reply here having only used Bitcoin once. I'll tell my story. 
It was about 9 or so months ago. I looked around for somewhere to buy Bitcoins. Went to Kraken as it was the best European exchange at the time, signed up, verified, and then got told I had to do a SEPA transfer from my bank which would cost £10. So Kraken was out, I only wanted to buy £60 worth. 
So I looked around some more and the only real way for me to get Bitcoins was via LocalBitcoins. Turns out banks over here hate Bitcoin companies, so you have to trade with an individual. 
So I registered for local Bitcoins, set up 2FA, and then went looking for a guy to buy from. As I only wanted £60 worth, and I wanted to do a bank transfer I think there was only a choice of about 5 people. Picked the guy with the second best rating after the first best rating guy didn't reply. 
I had to send a picture of my driving license to him, then he sent me his bank details and I paid him. After about 20 minutes he paid me. 
At this point I didn't particularly feel the 'trustless' nature of Bitcoin. Just buying Bitcoin I had to put way more trust in someone than I've ever had to do online before. It paid off, but it's not something I was useful. 
So anyway, I get home from work, go to localbitcoins.com to transfer the funds to my wallet I'd set up on my computer and... It was down. 
It stayed down for 3 whole days. Again, the trustless nature of Bitcoin didn't feel very trustless. Now I was trusting that this random site would come back up and that they'd not just done a runner. 
Again, it paid off and I managed to get my Bitcoins. 
Then I sent them to my Agora wallet, and again waited for them to show up.. But in that 3 days my £60 turned to £55 and I couldn't buy the product I wanted. I had to instead by the inferior cheaper one. It was still good, but not exactly what I wanted. 
All in all, I wouldn't use Bitcoin unless I was literally forced to. Maybe things have got better now, but I still don't see much of a solution to that helpless feeling you have when you send your Bitcoins away. All your trust is in the person you send them to.. Not something I'm used to with credit cards/paypal. I have an existing relationship with my CC provider and Paypal.. They've already gained my trust by doing well by me, so I don't have to trust merchants at all. 
Anyway, that's my story.

Can you tell me how buying via coinbase is any more secure than buying via paypal? Because I'm not seeing it. 
Paypal and Coinbase both have your bank details and authorization to withdraw from your bank account. 
Merchant never sees your bank details in either scenario. 
All you're doing with coinbase is personally paying the 1% and $0.15 for the merchant, which is kind of you an all.. But ultimately a dumb waste of money.

Then you could use [transferwise]( to transfer the money from the US account in dollars to the Swiss account in francs.

It'd be hypocrisy if anything. Cognitive dissonance is something I could feel, not commit. 
Anyway, I don't think I'm being particularly hypocritical because this community feels like Bitcoin specifically is the future and I think it's usually fair to be critical of the first iteration of anything. 
It's been 5 years and there's been very little innovation in the Bitcoin space. Nowhere near enough to warrant the amount of dollars spent, lost and stolen. 
There's been other cryptos come out as a result of Bitcoin, which is a good thing I imagine. But then this community slates them all pretty much universally. When there's true innovation everyone here will try and claim it's not needed, or they don't need it. Yadda, yadda. 
The problem is the pure amount of vested interest when it comes to bitcoin. It's a level of zeal unrivaled due to the very nature of what is being promoted. 
You've seen how heated Xbox vs Playstation debates get on the internet, right? And they're just products they bought and that was the end of it. 
The bitcoin community is like a rabid xbox fanboy, but with the added shitshow of actually standing to gain financially from winning heated arguments about xboxes vs playstations. 
tl;dr Frivolous spending does drive innovation, as long as the frivolous spenders don't stand to gain financially from what the frivolously spent their money on.

The community as a whole makes these promises time and time again. 
Whether it's hyping up adoption in China, Argentina or Cyprus. 
Or claiming the ETF is just around the corner. 
Or claiming Wall Street money is on its way. 
It doesn't matter, the community hypes up these events using weasel words like 'user adoption', 'new age' and 'paradigm shift' that invoke feeling of 'I'm going to be fucking rich' for the people reading them. 
Bitcoin *is* pretty innovative. It's seemingly the first ever P2P Ponzi. 
No single evil conspirator pulling the strings, just a lot of like minded assholes acting in their own self interest.

* [What are your bitcoin price predictions for 2 years from now?](


(Note how none of the upvoted comments are a price that is lower than todays.. Most are 400%+ higher)
* [Just for fun, let's submit our predictions for the price of 1BTC in December this year. First prize will be one pair of alpaca socks!](

Quite possible. What would cause such a fall in price? It might be something catastrophic, in which case I'd probably think it was worth even less. Yes. 
I basically only value Bitcoin on what it can do that other existing methods can't do. At the moment, that's essentially the online drug trade. The only time I've ever actually purchased bitcoins was to use on the darknet markets. The only time I've ever heard any of my friends discussing bitcoin was in relation to the darkmarkets and trying to buy drugs online. 
It's bitcoins killer app, imo. As long as those markets exist, bitcoin will always have value. 
Unless something like zerocash proves to be even more anonymous and gets adopted.
The philosophical aspect doesn't interest me whatsoever, and I don't think it'll interest the general public either. If the philosophy of Bitcoin is its killer app, it'll honestly get nowhere fast.

However it's not the default action of the money in their bank. They have to actually take out a treasury bond which requires:
1) Knowing about them
2) Knowing how to take one out
3) Having money that can be tied up for a year or more
That's a lot different to just having any money you get given go up 5% in purchasing power per year. 


No one is doing that in the current economy. It's an absurd, unrealistic and completely irrelevant straw man argument.

The first and third are ideological stuff that barely anyone cares about. Ask 100 people on the street to describe their ideology and the majority won't be able to. Ideology means very little in the grand scheme of things.. Everyone knows Nikes and iPhones are made in pretty terrible working conditions and sometimes with child labour.. No one cares. They still buy those items by the multi millions.
The second while possibly true doesn't take into account that with Bitcoin you **see** the fee and with debit/credit cards you don't. 
On top of that, more often than not discounts aren't given for paying with Bitcoin so you just end up paying 9 cents more, or whatever the minimum transaction cost is at the time. 
Honestly, I'm not trying to hate. I'm trying to make you guys realise that Bitcoin needs to make people want to use it **over current technologies**. It has to have a concrete advantage.. One place where it does have a concrete advantage is on the darkmarkets, for example. 
At the moment I equate Bitcoin in the legal eCommerce sector to giving everyone a pogo stick for free and expecting them to commute to work on it. It's just not realistic. Some people who fucking love pogo sticks might give it a go, but for your average person it's going to be a lot of work for no gain. 
Now melt down that pogo stick and cast it into the shape of a bicycle, add some tyres and a chain and you might have a chance of getting them to commute using it. 
That's what Bitcoin needs.. It needs to become more useful, and that can only be achieved by entering markets where credit/debit cards refuse to go. Unfortunately for Bitcoin, those are few and far between.

I do, but they're voluntary. 
I pay ~£12 a month and I get:
* 1% more interest on my savings (pays for the £12 a month)
* Phone insurance 
* Car breakdown cover
* Travel insurance
* Extended 12 months warranty on gadgets I buy
And a bunch of other shit I don't use. 
Even if I wasn't paying £12 a month it wouldn't cost me anything to have the account. Overdrafts are about 1.5% per month, bank transfers inside the UK are free and instant up to £10K, bank transfers to EU countries are a £10 flat fee, don't know how much international ones are as I've never made one.. No fee for spending on debit cards, no fees for using 95% of UK atms.

First off, same argument can be used for Bitcoin. The block rewards are currently subsidizing the network of miners, and it *still* costs ~10 cents per transaction.

The thing a lot of people on here don't seem to understand is that it's a problem with the US banking sector. It's not a problem with fiat. Fiat doesn't require fees to use, just like bitcoin doesn't. 
I'm from the UK and I never have to pay money to use money. ATM's are free, domestic bank transfers are free, I don't pay to keep my bank account, nor do I have to have a minimum balance to keep it open.. I use RFID to pay in most places when it's under £25, and I use chip and pin everywhere else. Got PayM on my mobile so I can pay people if they just give me their phone number. 11 numbers is much easier to remember than a random alpha numeric string about 27 characters long..
Just because the US banking system is a steaming pile of shit doesn't mean that's the way a banking system has to operate. There's plenty of banking systems that easily surpass the utility of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin seems like an attempt to throw out the baby with the bathwater. It just seems insane to me. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 12:42:40


That's true. However people currently have protection when paying online. They're unlikely to give that up. That's a step backwards as far as they'll be concerned.

When/if the cost to produce a bitcoin (electricity+hardware) outweighs the price of a bitcoin then why would miners continue mining? They'd be making a loss. 
I've heard that it currently costs about $105 in electricity to mine a bitcoin.. So that's the price it would need to go under (if that's the correct price) to put the theory to the test.

@_date: 2014-06-06 12:37:04
Arg, I get in this argument so many times on here.
There's 3 scenarios:
**1)** I lend you 1BTC @ $700 with 10% interest rate. I want $770 worth of bitcoin back in 12 months time. Bitcoin price rises by 25%. You pay me back $770 of bitcoin. That's 0.8637 bitcoin. I've lost 0.1363 bitcoin by lending to you, **and** I opened myself up to counterparty risk where you could entirely default. I'd be $105 better of if I'd not lent to you at all. 
**2)** I lend you 1BTC @ $700 with 10% interest rate. I want $770 worth of bitcoin back in 12 months time. Bitcoin price stagnates. You pay me back $770 of bitcoin. That's 1.1 bitcoin. I did okay. I did as well as is to be expected from a loan. 
**3)**  I lend you 1BTC @ $700 with 10% interest rate. I want $770 worth of bitcoin back in 12 months time. Bitcoin price goes down 25%. You pay me back $770 of bitcoin. That's 1.466 bitcoin. I came out better in terms of bitcoin holdings, but in dollar terms I only did as well scenario 2. 
So, given that bitcoin is designed to be deflationary.. Scenario 1 is all that will ever happen.. 
If you believe in 'TO DA MOON' then you believe scenario 1 is pretty much all that will happen for the foreseeable future. 
Anyone who lends bitcoin, and believes it's price will eventually increase, is an idiot who doesn't understand very simple economic principles.

How is it logical to reinvest? Make the argument. I'll make the economic argument against re-investing. 
First off, it costs a fee to buy Bitcoins. Depending on source it's anywhere from 0.5%-10%.
Lets use coinbase as our example. 
It costs 1% + $0.15 to buy bitcoin from coinbase. It costs merchants 1% to receive their dollars from coinbase. 
So the process for buying an item for a merchant and then reinvesting is as follows. 
Money &gt; Coinbase &gt; Bitcoin &gt; Coinbase &gt; Merchant
And then for reinvestment:
Money &gt; Coinbase &gt; Bitcoin
Lets say we buy some Artisan soap dildos, and we buy $100 worth. The fees are as follows (pseudomath):
($100 - 0.15) - 1% - 1% = $2.137015 in fees to get the money from your bank to the merchant. 
Then you need to reinvest:
($100-0.15) - 1% = $1.1485 in fees to reinvest. 
So in total $3.28 in fees, or 3.28%. 
There will be very few merchants paying that much for accepting credit cards. Even paypals top rate isn't that high and they're one of the most expensive ways to accept credit cards.. 
As such, it makes no sense to buy and then reinvest. Or at least it doesn't using coinbase, which I believe has the lowest fees but I'm willing to be be proved wrong.

It's never been a problem for me. Ever. I've probably done upwards of 1000 online transactions by now. According to my paypal I did 200 last year.
I think the complaints about the current system are extremely exaggerated, and the pitfalls of using bitcoin are often dismissed. 
Sure, you might get a fraudulent charge on your credit card but a phonecall later and it's sorted out.

This is the strongest argument against Bitcoin I can think of. In the current system if hackers somehow make it into the banks database and start moving numbers about it can all be reversed by doing some forensics on what the hackers did.

I want to borrow 1,000BTC (100,000 potatos) to manufacture my product and I want to pay it back in 25 years time.
The Bitcoin Business Loan Company(tm) offers me 1,000BTC loan at 3% interest per year.
So in 25 years time I have to pay back 1,000BTC plus 25 years of interest payments at 3% per year.
This is 2,093 BTC.
So you then also have to add 5% deflation per year on those bitcoins. After 25 years, 1 bitcoin would be worth ~338 potatoes.
338 * 2,093 = 707,434 potatoes paid for a 100,000 potato business loan. 
On top of that, while I was originally selling my product for 0.25 Bitcoins (25 potatoes) 25 years ago, I'm now selling it for ~0.07 bitcoins because of deflation.
Taking out loans in a deflationary currency (Bitcoin, or otherwise) is financial suicide. It's financially one of the dumbest things you can do.

Regardless, even at 0% Bitpay still has a cost for businesses. Staff training being the biggest one. 
How many times here on do you hear about someone going to a shop listed on coinmap only to find out the employee has no idea how to use Bitcoin. It's pretty damn often. Twice this week that I've read.. 
So you need to train all your employees how to transact in Bitcoin. This requires a group meeting, an instruction pamphlet, and probably 1-2 hours of the owners time. 
So lets say it's 2 hours of the owners time, 1 hours of all ten employees time.
Lets say they all earn minimum wage, including the owner. 
That's 12 hours * [£6.50]( = £78
He'll also need to buy an android tablet to run the bitpay software on, so that's another £89.99.
Now, lets say he pays the [average card processing fee of 0.9%](
That means to save £167.99 in processing fees and recoup his investment he'd need to process ~£16,799 worth of Bitcoin transactions. 
If he doesn't think there's ~£16,799 worth of custom to be attracted with Bitcoin, then there's no point accepting Bitcoin. 
So there you go. That was todays lesson in business.

The banks didn't rob anyone. The citizens of the world robbed each other by taking out loans they couldn't pay back. That's not the banks fault.. 


I never said I didn't trust Bitcoin. I said I don't trust merchants.. Paypal removes the need to trust merchants, that's why I like Paypal and probably do 95% of my ecommerce using Paypal. 


How can you say that as a negative of paypal, and then as a positive of Bitcoin you put:


Come on, man.. 


Yes, but are they? That's the point. Some tiny little start up escrow service via Bitcoin isn't going to convince me to move away from Paypal.. The whole point of me using Paypal is so I don't have to trust tiny little start ups. 


No, but I can file a dispute with paypal and get my money back.

It's just OPEC nations trying to stay relevant. By letting the price tumble they make green/fracking energy unprofitable. If they can keep oil low for long enough, investment in expensive green energy will dry up.

To be fair, if someone's that determined then they'll get your Bitcoins too. Credit card details just aren't that valuable and no one would waste that much time getting just to get one..

Hey, don't blame me for your incorrect terminology. 
The point to be taken away from this is transferring $100K of fiat and transferring $100K worth of Bitcoin are entirely different things. 
Transferring fiat directly is almost infinitely more useful than transferring Bitcoin since fiat is accepted everywhere and bitcoin is still only accepted in extremely niche cases. 
So yes, it only costs 5 cents.. But then you can't spend it as freely so it's less useful. 
The extra you'd spend transferring fiat directly translates well to the increased utility of fiat.

We've been able to buy stuff online for a decade and a half now. 
We've been able to buy stuff online using only a username and password (Paypal/Google wallet) for about a decade.

It's not like the jump from writing a letter or fax to sending an email.

They have absolutely no problem with bitcoin as long as you're adhering to the same money laundering laws they're adhering to, and you can prove it. 
Basically, they don't want *your* business getting *them* legal trouble. 
Everyone on here like to pretend it's the big bad banks trying to quell competition because a persecution complex seem to be coupled with bitcoin, but the truth is they just don't want any trouble. 
If you take the names and addresses of the people you do bitcoin business with, and offer them to the bank feely, they won't give a fuck. 
The trouble always comes where you have people trading bitcoins on localbitcoins and they have thousands of quid coming into their personal bank accounts from all over the UK with little to no explanation or evidence of who it's coming from or why. 
It has the exact same profile as money laundering. 
So yeah, if you're running a bitcoin business then open a business account, explain what you're doing and explain how you'll be keeping records. 
If you don't want to do that, then fuck you. Basically.

Is it, though? The only reason someone needs to hide money from the government is if the government thinks it's owed the money in some form. Otherwise it's perfectly safe in the current banking system.

There's a baseline supply by miners who need to sell to pay for their datacenters/minin equipment. But there's also a supply of people cashing out on their bitcoin investment. Maybe that's gone down, and is fuelling the rise in price.

There's more apples the second day, but the value of the apples will still be the same.

That's cool and all, but it's still very much a fringe use of currency. How often do you donate to doctors half a world away? How often do you buy something from a grocery store?

Although the fact that bank transfers are free and instant (in the UK at least) is proof that the technology isn't the problem here.. It's a lack of will to change. 
In the UK the government told the banks they needed to speed up transfers. What resulted was instant domestic transfers, for free.


If bitcoin becomes a genuine threat, banks in the US can just follow the same path as UK banks and that's that. Bitcoins advantages diminished greatly.

25,606,888.95 GH/s is the current computing power of the bitcoin network. 
What's currently the most efficient miner per GH/s?
Avalon? Well they manage 210GH/s for 420 watts. 
So the current bitcoin ecosystem if it was a efficient as it could possibly be is running at around 48.7 mw/h. 
The current daily transaction volume is around 120 million dollars and 83708 transactions. 
Yeah, it won't scale for shit. 
For example, I think it's fair to say pretty much every adult in the US pays for something once a day. A coffee, lunch, whatever. So lets say there's at least 300m odd transactions in the USA each day. 
If we scale up using the above figures as our base, it would take 174,535 MW/h to run the network.

This is the same for all money transfer. 
We've had the technology to do global money transfer easily since the advent of the internet. 
The actual costs are:
* Staffing
* Regulatory compliance 
* Real estate
* Lack of standardisation 
Bitcoin doesn't do anything for the first three, but it could help the last one. 
But so would every bank on earth just agreeing to a fixed standard for international money transfer. They could all agree to Bitcoin, but they could also all agree on something completely different. That's essentially what SWIFT is. 
SWIFT is instant and IIRC about 1-2 cents per transfer. The hang up is when the SWIFT message gets to the bank and their computer systems have to parse it. All banks have a different way of doing that, although there's been a lot of work to standardize in recent years. 
Implementing Bitcoin would be throwing the baby out with the bath water.

So, coinbase charges 1% + $0.15 per purchase, right? And then they charge another 1% to the merchant.. 
So you buy a $10 indie bundle with buyback enabled and you're charged 1% (10 cents) and then $0.15. Then the merchant is charged 10 cents as well. 
So 45 cents goes straight to coinbase and for that 45 cents you basically get nothing. 
At the worst paypal rate there is, they'd charge 59 cents. At the best rate for high volume merchants, 49 cents. For that you get consumer protection as well as being able to buy almost anywhere..

Accepting bitcoins essentially means you can spam hundreds of bitcoin forums with your websites URL and have the users of those forums thank you for it.

Because you're opening yourself up to twice the risk. 
If you invest in a business that relies on bitcoin increasing in value you gamble on the fact that bitcoin will go up in price **and** the people running the business being competent and/or not fraudsters. 
If you just hold bitcoin you're only gambling on the price rising.

I'd rather pay a couple percent more and know I have the option of doing a chargeback if the product is complete shite or never arrives. 
I don't think people here on really understand business and the driving force behind online purchases. 
Places like Amazon have a huge amount of trust they've built up over the past ~2 decades. They're a household name. When I put my card details in their site I don't worry for one second that they'll be stolen. Nor do I worry that a product won't arrive, because I know Amazon do well by their customers. 
However when I'm looking at  I have no fucking clue if I can trust them with my card details. They might be the cheapest vendor of artisan animal shaped toilet seats around, but if I can't trust them then I'm not going to fork over my £200 for an artisan animal shaped toilet seat from their store. 
I'll go to Amazon and get a bog standard animal shaped toilet seat instead. 
This is where paypal comes in. I trust paypal. They're also a decade+ company with a strong reputation behind them. 
Now, if  accepts paypal the trust is offloaded from  to  
I trust paypal.com, and by proxy I now trust  because they accept payments via paypal. 
Result is that I get the artisan animal shaped toilet seat I've always dreamed of and  makes a sale. 
In a world where each individual site must gain trust, it'd just be too difficult. Places like Amazon would gain a monopoly of trust. 
Also it's worth thinking about how much  and amazon.com are being charged for my trust. 
 via paypal might cost me 3.5% and 25 cents per purchase. 
 Well they've already gained the worlds trust. Their card processing fees are probably absolutely minuscule because of their complex fraud prevention systems and the volume they shift. Probably sub 0.25% per purchase. 
In the end, the sites that are trusted the most are charged the least for card processing. Which makes complete sense. 
tl;dr The current system is the way it is because it's logical and was decided upon by the free market.

Another thing, this data shows how large the discounts are likely to be for the reduction in fraud. Around 2% seems likely. Maybe add another 2% for reduction in credit card fees. 
So 4-5% discounts are the best customers can really hope for, given this data. Depends on the sector, of course. Some sectors have higher rates of fraud. 
Still, is a 5% discount worth going through the hassle of getting bitcoins? 5% can be an hour of fluctuation on the exchanges. 
Then you also have to factor in the lack of consumer protection you now have from the merchant screwing you. 
I'm not sure it's worth the 5% currently.

The thing is, consumers can't ask a company 'Can I see an audit which confirms that you're Bitcoin Transactors Act compliant?' and get an answer. 
That's where regulations are useful to the consumer. They confirm if the company is doing the bare minimum they should be doing to secure their money from theft..  
Most arguments against regulation stem from abiding by them being costly and therefore cost prohibitive for new start ups, which hinders progress. 
But it **should** be hard to start up a website that stores hundreds of millions of dollars of peoples funds. It **should** require a minimum amount of competency and start up capital.

I never claimed otherwise. 


My point is that the 8.97% number you used in your example is almost certainly complete bullshit. You can literally get a better rate with paypal and they're one of the most expensive in the business. 
Paypals rates start at 2.9% and 30 cents yet you claim that 3.5% and 40 cents is a 'good rate'. 
If you don't want an argument, stop talking complete shit. 
Oh and bitcoin is almost entirely used by a techy young demographic. What possible incentive is there to adopt bitcoin when they have that demographic nailed down already? Most people commenting here probably already have a netflix subscription and it wouldn't sway them either way. 
The only point of adopting bitcoin at the moment is if your demographic is techy, you have absolutely no budget for advertising and next to no market share. 
They'd be better served accepting diapers for payment in an attempt to attract the 'mom' demographic.

Okay, so lets pretend 1 BTC = 10 big macs. 
You earn 1BTC a month. 
You take out a 400BTC loan, which is worth 4,000 big macs. 
The lender says that you'll pay 5% APR, and you have to settle the debt after 5 years. 
Lets say economic deflation is a steady 3% per year. 
After 5 years the 400BTC principle would now be worth 4,637.1 big macs. 
But because of the 5% interest on the loan you'd actually need to pay back 510 bitcoins, or 5811.6 big macs. 
So you end up paying back 27% more bitcoins, but 45% more big macs. 
On top of that, you're now getting paid just 0.86BTC a month (10 big macs)..
You see why a mortgage in a deflationary currency is a load of fucking horse shit and would never work? You'd have to be eating crayons levels of retarded to take out a mortgage (or any loan) denominated in a deflationary currency.

I really shouldn't need to explain why having a lot of money is advantageous in business.. 
For example, for you to start an airline you might need a $100,000,000 loan at, lets say, 5% APR. 
For someone who already has $100,000,000 he can start an airline and he won't need to spend $5,000,000 on interest payments. That'll mean he can undercut you, assuming everything else is the same.

I'll never understand where the idea that the only reason anyone could ever hate on Bitcoin is because they don't understand the technology. It's such a red herring. 
It's not even that technical from a high level. The main points are:
* Decentralized. 
* 21m limit of Bitcoins.
* Works over the internet. 
* Transactions are final. 
That's all anyone really needs to know about Bitcoin, and it doesn't take a fucking rocket scientist for them to decide if those are desirable qualities. 
The intricacies of Bitcoin are really of no concern to the average consumer. The 4 points above are literally the only thing they (the masses) will factor in when deciding if they want to use it. 
Just like no one gives a fuck how the world wide web or internet works. They only care that it works and lets them watch cats falling down on youtube. 
So, you might now say that something will be built on top of Bitcoin. Something like how the World Wide Web was built on top of the Internet..
But if that's the case.. Where is it? It's been 5 years now and the only convincing use case for Bitcoin is online gambling if you live in the USA and a drugs ebay. 
No one here admits to that, though. On here everyone thinks that doing normal ecommerce as has been done for over a decade without Bitcoin, is a reason to use Bitcoin. 
It's not.

Banking in the UK is way better than in the US.. There's simply less need for something like Coinbase. 
* Online domestic transfers under £10-20K are free and instant in the UK, across all banks. If you go to a branch, the limit is upped to £100K in most cases.  
* [The UK average processing fee for credit cards is 0.9% and for debit cards it's 0.2%.](
* [We also have PayM]( which means by 2016 all you need to send money to someone is their mobile number. Again free, although I think there's a limit of ~£250. That accounts for a lot of simple IOU transactions. 
* Chip and Pin has been standard everywhere for ~10 years now. A lot harder to get your card skimmed. 
* 95%+ ATM's are free. Any ATM inside or on the side of a bank is free, regardless of the bank you bank with. Usually only the private ATM's in football grounds or strip clubs cost money. 
* Contactless payments are quite common now. Just tap card to payment machine and you're done. Limit of £25, but it's not much harder to just put your pin in if it's over £25.  
* All basic bank accounts are free in the UK. All the basic accounts offer everything listed above, and more. You'll usually only pay (like I do) if you want the extras the bank provide. I pay £10 a month and get car breakdown cover, mobile phone insurance, travel insurance, an extra 1% on savings and a bunch of other shit I don't use.

You guys just have no idea how this shit works, do you? You're genuinely still expecting huge growth factors this late in the game. 
This is how 2000% jumps look, starting at $1. 
2000% of 1 = 20
2000% of 20 = 400
2000% of 400 = 8000
2000% of 8000 = 160,000

Well from a cursory google search I found [this company]( who offer an exchange rate of £1 = 74.65PHP and a £6 charge for doing a bank to bank transfer. 
10,000/75.65 = £132.19 
Then add the £6 and that makes the overall cost £138.19.

I exclusively use NFC for payments under £25. It's clearly less secure, but the £25 limit is there for that reason and I find it really convenient.. Also, banks are willing to take the loss if my card gets stolen so might as well let them. 
Plus after I think 3-4 NFC transactions a day it asks me to authorize using my pin to check it's me so at most, the bank is going to be £75-100 out in the event of a stolen card. 
I think they're really just getting the tech in place for when phone NFC takes off. Then there'll be added layers of security.

But there's less trust involved in a system like Paypal than there is with a system like Bitcoin. 
**Scenario 1**
I want to buy a widget and it costs me £50. I sent £50 to the merchant via paypal, and he sends me the item. I don't have to trust him because I know that if he doesn't send the item I can get my money back. He doesn't have to trust me because he knows that as long as he has a tracking ID for what he sent, Paypal won't take the money back. 
All we have to do is trust the mediator, who is very well known. It's a centralization of trust, if you will. 
**Scenario 2**
I want to buy a widget and it costs me £50. I sent £50 to the merchant via Bitcoin. He sends me the item. That's it. No recourse if he doesn't send the item. 
100% of the trust of that transaction was me trusting the merchant. He has nothing to lose, other than reputation. But that is the same in scenario 1. 
Bitcoin means you have to put MORE trust into the sites you shop at.

But the consumer doesn't care about the merchants margins. 
For an extreme example, if Microsoft told you that you could pay with potatoes or Bitcoins would you ever pay with potatoes? No. There's no benefit to you unless you have excess potatoes you need to get rid of. If you have no potatoes then you'd need to go source them and buy them.. 
Do you agree? 
Well that's essentially cards vs Bitcoin.. Merchant adoption won't drive consumer adoption. It doesn't work like that at all. There needs to be a reason for Bitcoins use.. A use case. Is simply existing isn't a use case.

But there's still trust involved. You send money to a business, and then you trust them to send you the product or provide the service you paid for. The trust is still there. 
[This hilariously active subforum of bitcointalk]( is proof that trust still exists in a Bitcoin economy. All you're doing is shifting the trust from yourself, to someone else.

No fucking way. Bitpay is by far the biggest bitcoin payment processor and they're only reporting $100m for last year. 
Even if they're at $10m a month, that'll be a huge chunk of the legit bitcoin traffic (not between wallets), a purchase of goods..
Individuals buying goods with pure bitcoin via wallet software &gt; non processor address is pretty rare. 
There's no way it'll be ~100 times more..  Plus current estimates (and they were convincing) put the number of active bitcoin users at 500,000 to 800,000. 
That'd mean each bitcoiner would need to spend a minimum of over $16K of bitcoin per year. That doesn't seem very likely.

Some of the biggest holders of bitcoins are outright criminals. And I don't just mean drug dealing which a lot of people on here don't count as a crime, I mean actual fraud where bitcoins were just outright stolen. 
Please, tell me again how Bitcoin is humanitarian. 
It's not, it's a cash grab. Some people on here are at the *bottom* of the current system and think they can get to the *top* of the next system.

IMO, it will never take that title. A centralized system will **always** cost less than a decentralized system due to there being much less redundancy. 
For example, in the UK we have something called 'faster payments service' that means you can transfer money instantly to any bank account in the UK for free regardless of who you bank with.
That's just one example of a centralized system that is both cheaper and faster than Bitcoin. And that's 6 year old technology. 
Bitcoins biggest advantage at the moment is that it's in a regulatory grey area. It doesn't have to abide by the costly regulation that banks have to abide by. 
It won't be that way forever. Either Bitcoin companies will be regulated, or Banks will become less regulated. Either way I think parity will likely be met whereby either Bitcoin companies have to charge more because they have to conform to regulations or banks will be able to charge less because they don't have to conform to regulations. 
The back end systems that power banks aren't the expensive part of the operation. Bitcoin essentially replaces the cheapest part of the process of transferring money.

@_date: 2014-12-01 01:27:56
Raw bitcoin has a tiny transaction fee that is technically optional, but if you want your transfer confirmed promptly you'll need to supply it. It's about 1 cent. 
However, you also need to factor in how to get Bitcoin. There's a few ways to get Bitcoin, and they are:
* Earn it
* Mine it
* Buy it
It's pretty difficult to do the first two, so for most people the third option is what they'll use. Depending on the exchange you use the fee for buying Bitcoin will be about 0.5-1%. 
So you buy your Bitcoin (costs 0.5-1%) then you transfer it to your family in whereverthefuckistan (1 cent) and they end up with Bitcoin. 
But the problem is that in most of the world Bitcoin is pretty much useless. They'll need to convert the Bitcoin to their local fiat to spend. 
Depending on the country this can cost 0.5% (an exchange) to 15% (localbitcoins).. And it might be totally impossible because no one locally wants Bitcoins. 
So yeah, sending Bitcoin is pretty much free. Sending fiat with Bitcoin, isn't.

How do you know who I don't want to borrow money from? What's the alternative when it comes to borrowing anyway? People *need* to borrow money, and a bank is as good as any to borrow from. 


As a consumer, why does this matter to me at all? 


It's a credit card. It's not my money, that's the point. 


The end result being a few phone calls to my bank to explain I didn't make the purchases. What happens if your computer gets hacked and your private keys are stolen? Who do you call to get things straitened out? 


For ~2% I get piece of mind that should the merchant flake on his end of the deal I just have to phone up my bank and have a whinge and I'll get my money back, or rather not need to owe the bank that money. Well worth it. 
For example, if I were to use Bitcoin and I got conned **once** for £250 I'd need to do £12,500 of Bitcoin transactions over credit card transactions to save that £250 on credit card fees.. 
That's probably 2+ years of online card purchases for me. And if I get scammed again I'm back to square one. 


I don't care. That's a cost of doing business as far as I'm concerned. I am a consumer, not a merchant. If they want my money they have to play by my rules. The customer is always right for a reason, it's because we hold the power. 


And yet it's never happened. I want to spend money, they want to make money. It's a mutually beneficial relationship. There's no incentive for them to suspend my account. 


That's fine, but just know that you're a niche case.

Basically, NeoBee's business plan was:
* Take euros from Cyprus customers
* Buy bitcoins with euros
* Wait for bitcoins to rise in price
* When customer asks for their euros back, sell the bitcoins, give their euros back and pocket/pay out the difference.
Essentially banks do a similar thing. They take depositors money and then invest it, however due to various regulations they must have x% of their investors cash IN cash. 
Hence the term fractional reserve. You need a fraction of your clients cash, in reserve. 
Generally though banks will diversify their investments in a huge range of investments. Stocks, securities, yadda, yadda. 
NeoBees tactic was to do fractional reserve ONLY investing in bitcoin. 
Completely mental.

I wasn't trying to be difficult. I just don't trust bitcoin specific news sources to report accurately when it comes to the current banking system. 
So they've upped the limit to £500. That's a good thing. The limit from an ATM used to be less. I think for my bank it's about £350. 
Better source, thanks. That's kinda weird behaviour. I think they're probably just trying to encourage wire transfers when it comes to large amount of money. Processing a withdrawal of physical cash is a pain in the arse above a certain amount. If it can be transferred electronically, it should be. 
I've also heard of banks asking questions when old people come into the bank and request to withdraw large amounts of cash because it's surprisingly common for them to then take that cash straight to a western union and transfer it to some nigerian.

Bitcoin lending will never happen because it's deflationary. If you borrow a deflationary currency, it will fuck you over big time. 
If you borrow 1BTC at $1000 and agree to pay back 1.1BTC in a years time... And then 1BTC rises in value to $1500. 
You then owe $1650. 
You see why that makes it a horrible deal for the borrower?

The reason for its value is supply and demand. People sit on bitcoin like mad.. They might spend a bit here or there in one of the few places that accept it but for the most part it just sits in their wallets. 
So anyway, people get wind that bitcoin had 3000% gains last year or whatever. They want in, but no one wants to sell. 
The demand grows, the supply dwindles. 
Huge increase in price. 
And that's why it has the value it has at the moment. If we were talking about utility alone then bitcoin would be in mid double digits. 
It's actual utility is in buying illegal shit online. No one likes to admit it, but it's true.

I do realise that, but it's the 'last mile' that's where you want the least amount of trust. 
Mastercard, Visa, Paypal.. They're known entities. You can trust them to not rob you. 
That random e-commerce site I found on shopping.google.com that has the cheapest 52 inch TV.. That's an unknown entity. 
With the system that exists I don't need to trust that random e-commerce store. I just need to trust that Visa/Mastercard/Paypal will sort me out if the merchant's a dodgy bastard. And Visa/Mastercard/Paypal are multi billion dollar companies with staff, procedures, a clearly defined terms and conditions and a track record..
So yes, Bitcoin is trustless. But it's trustless at the point where the average consumer doesn't even think about trust, and then not trustless for the bit where the consumer is the most apprehensive. It seems very backwards.

After 18 months of being a skeptical observer here on I finally bought £60 worth on Friday from Localbitcoins. Did a wire transfer.

It doesn't feel much like the currency of the future. Also, yesterday I had enough for 10 tabs of LSD, but today I'm 30p short. Very annoying. I'll have to hold off on my purchase now and hope the price goes up. 
One more thing.. People claim that bitcoin is a trustless system but at the moment it doesn't feel that way at all. 
When I wire £60 to a random guy on localbitcoins, I put trust in him. 
When I store my bitcoins on localbitcoins temporarily, I put trust in them. 
When I eventually get a chance to buy my damn drugs, I'll be putting my trust in a drugdealer.

For a long time now Apples main 'job' has been to essentially force new technology into customers hands.

&lt;10 years on and you can't find a phone that isn't a smart phone, with a touch screen and an app store. 
Tablets existed for about a decade in one form or another before Apple bought out the iPad. They bring out the iPad and then bam, people finally see the merit of tablet computers. 
Apple is extremely valuable. They generally take poorly implemented good ideas and turn them into well implemented good ideas. Then they sell them to their loyal fanbase and that's that. The technology is out there. 
Imagine if you could get Apple to hype Bitcoin at their 2015 keynote speech. That would make people listen..

Lets use a mortgage as an example...
Okay, so I earn 1BTC a month which is equal to 100 potatoes. 
Bitcoin deflation is 5% per year.
I want to borrow 1,000BTC to buy a house worth 100,000 potatos and I want to pay it back in 25 years time. 
The Bitcoin Mortgage Company(tm) offers me 1,000BTC loan at 3% interest per year. 
So in 25 years time I have to pay back 1,000BTC plus 25 years of interest payments at 3% per year. 
This is 2,093 BTC.
So you then also have to add 5% deflation per year on those bitcoins. After 25 years, 1 bitcoin would be worth ~338 potatoes. 
338 * 2,093 = 707,434 potatoes paid for a 100,000 potato house. 
THEN you need to take into account that peoples wages (in bitcoin terms) would be shrinking year on year because of deflation. 
If I was paid 1BTC a month, and there was 5% bitcoin deflation per year and my boss only wanted to give me a 2% pay rise then the bitcoin amount I'm paid each month would go down 3%. 
So now it just becomes even harder to pay off a bitcoin loan. 
I bet you wish you weren't so fucking condescending now.. You're one of the people I was talking about in my original post you dunning–kruger motherfucker.

To transfer $500 from UAE it costs:
India = 1.46%
Siri Lanka = 1.48%

The thing is, there's no reason at all that the current banking system can't be more efficient than bitcoin. It's just taking time, that's all. They're investing billions to upgrade, though. The biggest problem at the moment is the incompatibility from country to country, and that's where most of the money is being spent. 
For example, in the UK our domestic banking system is currently more efficient than bitcoin. 
In my bank account I get 1% interest on my current account and ~3% on my savings account. I can instantly transfer money to any bank account in the UK for free. If someone steals money from my account, I can claim it back from the bank. I can use a card that my bank gave me to pay in any shop in the UK, or I can put it in an ATM and get money out without paying any fees. 
That's much better than anything Bitcoin can offer me and it's better than anything I see on the horizon for bitcoin. 
Maybe if I did loads of international commerce bitcoin might make more sense, but paypal is pretty damn good for international payments in terms of ease of use. Or something like transferwise for personal transfers. 
I dunno. It just seems that bitcoin doesn't actually offer much that the current system couldn't offer if they ever actually felt that bitcoin was becoming a problem to them. It feels like one big pump and deception by people who own bitcoins just to make some money.

Inflation is a plus when it's is moderate, year on year. 
It encourages investment, which is good for an economy. When it's too high, it's problematic because it hinders the purchasing power and therefore the amount people can invest. 
Deflation is bad because there's no incentive to invest your money. It's purchasing power is increasing just by it existing. Nothing of value is being added to society, nor the economy.

I disagree. I mean, in its current state you're correct but that's the good thing about software. It can be improved and changed to suit your needs. 
I can't imagine any bank wanting to use an irreversible system for their backend. At the moment if someone hacks into a bank and fiddles with their databases they could use forensics, backups, version control, etc to see what was changed and then change it back. 
Someone breaks into their system and empties it of their Bitcoin and they're shit out of luck.

See, I don't understand this mindset. Says who? Who is to say whether or not inflation should or shouldn't exist? 
It's essentially one opinion vs another opinion. There's no should or shouldn't on earth, only doing and not doing. Inflationary currencies won out long ago..
As for your argument about saving being beneficial for an economy because it makes everyone elses currency more valuable.. It does that temporarily. It does that, right up until that person decides to spend. 
Supply and demand doesn't really factor in artificial supply constraints. They're a zero sum game if you assume that people will release their coins at some point. Any benefit gained from the withholding of coins today, will be undone by the release of coins tomorrow. 
What would happen right now if Satoshi Nakamoto dumped all his coins onto the exchanges? The bitcoin economy would flip the fuck out.

Yeah, that's what I'm saying. 
If the customer wants the same amount of bitcoin back in the event of a refund then the company will have to hold onto the bitcoins. That means the merchant would have to take on the risk of price volatility, which they'd have to be insane to do. 
So the risk is shifted onto the customer instead. If you pay with Bitcoin you may get more/less back if there's a refund because they'll just rebuy the Bitcoins to the dollar amount of the refund.

The bet is set up to be really one sided. 
So I take the bet, and I win. Bitcoin falls to $0, and I get $320 in my paypal account. 
But if I take the bet, and I lose and the price of a Bitcoin goes to $1,000 then I now need to pay out $1,000 when I only ever had the possibility to win $320. 
Okay, you might say. So hedge the bet and buy the Bitcoin today and keep hold of it. 
However if I do that, I spend $320. Now if Bitcoin falls to $0 I'm out $320 on that initial bitcoin purchase, and I get back $320 from eof.. So best case scenario is I break even on a bet where I risk losing $320. 
It's a shitty one sided bet. Only a scammer or an idiot would propose it, and since the guy's a Bitcoiner I'm just going to assume he's both.

In regards to the pictures of the Chinese bitcoin farms we've been seeing recently. 
Does no one else think this is a horrific waste of resources to secure just 2 transactions per second on average? Seeing all that metal and electricity being put into powering 5% of a network that is only doing 2tps is insane to me. 
Then to think that most of the machines will just be thrown away in a few months when they become unprofitable.. It's just so backwards. A complete step in the wrong direction as a society. 
It's even worse that it's in China where most of the electricity will be from coal plants. 
Honestly, I could code myself a centralized simple payment network, run it on a single mid spec server and still manage 2tps quite easily. 
What can be done about this in the cryptocurrency sector. It's not sustainable. I wouldn't be surprised if Visa uses less electricity than the bitcoin network does and they're doing thousands of transactions per second.

Otherwise your car will just be doing loads of calls to check the current exchange rate, yadda yadda. A load of wasted effort.

Realistically, though, the savings won't be the 10% we're seeing at Newegg and Dell. That's entirely a marketing ploy and no way the cost of doing business with credit cards. 
For example, Dell has paypal as an option. A bit retailer like Dell will be getting custom rates from paypal likely no more than 1.5% + 30 cents given the volume they do. 
The reason we're seeing 10% is because, essentially, it's a marketing tactic. It's like giving 10% discount to war vets or something. 
So in a bitcoin everywhere world, we might see a decrease of 2-5%, maybe. The bigger the retailer, the less of a price decrease. 
Yeah, that's might sway me with bigger retailers like Amazon/Dell/Etc. But no name little ecommerce sites (which I use quite often to find the cheapest product) I wouldn't touch with a barge pole. I only use them now because I know that if they don't deliver my item, I can whine to paypal and get them to refund me. 
So will that 2-5% saving on the big ecommerce sites exceed the premium often seen by shopping on those sites over little no names? For some things, yes. For others, no. 
Basically, it's hard to say.
It'd be much better if Bitcoin didn't need to rely on merchants giving discounts. Hell, there's cashback credit cards which match the 2-5% saving Bitcoin might offer. And now we're back to square one. 
Bitcoin needs that killer app. It's no real surprise that Bitcoin only really got attention and popularity when its first killer app (Silk Road) was introduced. That got it to its niche status it currently is. 
It'll need a legal killer app to get any further, and I can't for the life of me think of what that might be.

Lending is always important. How do you start an aeroplane manufacturer without someone to borrow from? You're meant to save up the $100m seed capital? 
Or how do you fulfil an order for 100,000 of your product when you don't have the money for the materials and manufacture in your reserves? 
It's ludicrous to say that lending isn't important in any economy. 
Deflation stifles innovation because people are less inclined to to invest their money/assets when they're going up in value with 0% risk anyway..


Isn't that a completely redundant sentence? At the very least, it's overly complicated. You're saying you can remove money from your savings, essentially? No shit.

The main point being that the fall in oil price followed the recession, it didn't cause it. 
Demand went down across the entire world. 
What's happened this time is that the USA is now flooding the market with shale oil. They overtook Saudi Arabia last year as the biggest oil producers. 
This is a power play by Saudi Arabia to claw back market share. Demand has fallen slightly, supply has increased greatly and Saudi Arabia has decided to not turn down production which would mean giving up market share to the US..
Saudi Arabia has wells that are profitable at $20-30 a barrel. The US can't match that. Eventually, the US will stop pumping and Saudi Arabia will claw back market share. 
There's also theories that Saudi Arabia is also doing this to stick the knife in Russia due to their support of Assad. And maybe even as a fuck you to Iran as well, just because they just fucking hate Iran.. 
Anyway, OP is talking a load of shit. This is nothing like 2008.

I think it's easier if you use potatoes, and I still don't think you're getting it right. 
Year 0: 1BTC can buy you 100 potatoes. 
Year 1: 1BTC can buy you 104 potatoes
That's 4% deflation. The BTC amounts never change, but their purchasing power does. 
The problem is that banks want to make money with their money. They want to lend it out and charge interest. 
So they want to lend out 1BTC and get back 1.05BTC. A nice 5% RoI. 
The problem is, that after a year with 4% deflation and 5% interest the **borrower** will be paying back ~109 potatoes for their 100 potato loan. 
The problem gets worse, because in a deflating currency economy that persons employer would also reduce their pay by the amount of bitcoin deflation that year.. Or maybe only decrease it a bit (effectively a pay rise) if they're nice. 
So they need to pay back ~9% on their loan but because they get their wages in bitcoin they'll actually also have 4% less bitcoins to pay back with. 
It's a complete bullshit deal for the borrower. It's such a bullshit deal that it runs the risk of the borrower defaulting since it's almost like a feedback loop of debt where it's very hard to win. 
So the increased risk = increased rates. 
And then the problem is just compounded. 
Lending in a deflationary currency doesn't and can't work. Borrowers wouldn't be stupid enough to do it, lenders... Wouldn't be stupid enough to do it.

This is a bog standard false dichotomy. 
There's a term brandished around here whenever the price is slumping. 
'When others are greedy, be fearful. And when others are fearful, be greedy.'
Why would you put your money into the economic equivalent of a black hole which is precious metals or Bitcoin when you could invest in undervalued stock instead. 
We saw it in 2008. Across the board almost all blue chip stocks fell for no good reason.. And they kept falling, just because everyone was shitting their pants. Their fundamentals hadn't changed overnight, and people who realised that (and stayed away from bank stocks, obvs) did extremely well out of the last downturn. 
So yeah. They're not even close to the only two options. 
Oh, and if they **were** the only two options who on earth (beyond this subreddit) would bet on Bitcoin with its 'potential for massive loss or massive gains' when they could just dial in their losses and go for the bonds? If you offered me -xx% on my savings guaranteed or +/-xxx% on my savings who knows.. I'd pick the guaranteed loss. You can plan your life around a guaranteed loss.

They're not needed, right up until they're needed. 
For a recent example of this attitude very nearly being catastrophic you need look no further than the Falklands war. We'd neglected our military for a few decades, then about 6 months before we were going to sell one of our two aircraft carriers to Australia the Argies invaded the Falklands and we had to cancel the sale and go take the islands back.. 
Had we sold that aircraft carrier it would have made taking back the islands almost impossible. 
So, as I said. They're not needed right up until the point they are needed. 
The USA in particular doesn't really have to worry about US military spending too much since they have a policy of buying US only. The large majority of the money will make its way back to the public in one form or another through taxes all the way down the line. 
With each middle man, the government takes a little nibble out of the money. 
It's worse for us (uk) because we generally buy American too.. So the money just leaves our country never to be seen again.

This is so dumb.
Effectively this means that if I lend out 1BTC @ $700, and the price rises to $800 per BTC, I get back 0.86 BTC for the 1BTC I lent out. Plus interest. 
Why the hell would I ever lend using your service? It makes no sense. When bitcoin is rising in price, I will always lose out. On top of that, I have to trust my bitcoins with someone else. I'd need to charge 25%+ interest and if I did that, why would anyone in their right mind borrow from me?
When bitcoin is falling in price, I'll not be so bad.. I'll still make the interest.
But the end goal of bitcoin is for it to be deflationary in nature each year. So eventually, your business plan will be completely unsustainable since it requires a depreciating bitcoin value. 
Of course, your average bitcoin user has a very simple and often misguided view of how economics works. So they probably won't notice that it's a fucking dumb idea to use your service. 
So yeah, you'll probably do alright for a bit. But it makes no economic sense. It's the same reason so many people get completely buttfucked by denominating their mortgages in a foreign currency.

The thing is, it's very rare to find a site that actually takes credit card numbers themselves. It's almost always fobbed off to a huge multinational corporation who will be really secure. Paypal, Worldpay, etc. 
Personally, I'd estimate I use paypal for somewhere around 90% of my online purchasing. 
Username and password, then two clicks. It's effortless and in the end I only trust Paypal with my card details. Plus, I have someone to shout at if something goes wrong. Actually, I have two people to shout at. Paypal and then my bank. It's a lot of shouting I can do. 
I see threads on here a lot where someones HDD broke, or their coins got stolen from their online accounts and they're shit out of luck and mt gox or whatever just tell them to report it to the police.

I have bought Bitcoin before. It was a nerve-racking, expensive and convoluted process. The only reason I bothered is because you can't buy LSD with paypal! 
I maintain that Bitcoin won't see real popularity until there is a decent reason to use it above the existing payment technology we have. At the moment the only reasons you have for using bitcoin to shop are:
* Ideological
* Buying drugs online in countries drugs are illegal
* Gambling online in countries gambling is illegal
And those reasons have been static for about 3+ years now. I'm not convinced there's even another use for Bitcoin. Maybe remittance? But a lot of the cost of remittance is regulatory compliance and that little shop in the middle of buttfuck nowhere in Nambia that actually hands over the dollars to the person you're sending them to. Bitcoin doesn't get rid of those costs. It replaces probably the cheapest part of the whole process, the remittance companies backend. And probably makes it *more* expensive.
What I'm trying to say is that if you made pogo sticks free for everyone in the world you still wouldn't see people riding pogo sticks to work each morning. 
You need to give them something useful. Something they want or need to use. Simply existing isn't enough. 
It's up to people in the Bitcoin community to come up a killer app for Bitcoin. 
At the moment, imo, it's the Darknet Markets. But no one here likes to admit that.

Well it's particularly easy to see when they don't follow a regulation that says all payments must be settled by the end of the day. Payment not settled by the end of the day? Regulations not being followed. 


Everything is a barrier to entry. There **should** be barriers to entry when it comes to something as important as banks. I don't want any old Tom, Dick and Harry starting a bank and fucking over their clients due to incompetence. There should be safeguards (regulations) in place for such industries, if not all industries. 


After 18 months of being a skeptic bitcoin observer I finally decided to purchase some on Friday and I can positively say that I've never had to put so much trust into people as I did when buying bitcoins. 
I tried Kraken but it was too hard and expensive to transfer money out of the UK to their Euro bank account, and transferwise had disabled deposits to Kraken. 
So in the end I went with LocalBitcoins. I wired money to a complete stranger, which involves a lot of trust, and he sent me some bitcoins. Then I went to spend them on Saturday and LocalBitcoins.com was down.. I'm currently trusting that it'll come back up and my coins will still be there. 
I know this subreddit explicit recommends that you always store your bitcoins yourself, but I figured a day wouldn't be so bad. Even if I did put it on my computer, I'd then be putting my trust in my PC's hard drive. It's not enterprise standard, it's consumer standard. I don't put much trust in it. 
When I finally get my bitcoins, I'm then going to have to put all my trust into the merchant I buy from not to screw me. 
It really doesn't feel trustless at all. I quite like the current centralized trust I have. I trust my bank, and everything else is irrelevant. It's easier to do due diligence on a single bank than it is on every website I'll ever buy something from. It'd be tiring.

You think this isn't constructive? I wonder how many people I saved a lot of money in December by telling them it was a clear bubble when many others were loudly shouting 'Paradigm shift! Normal rules don't apply!'.. 
If money wasn't involved, I'd agree with you. It wouldn't be constructive. But money is involved, and there's a clear benefit in arguing against bitcoin because of that. 
Notice, I'm not arguing against cryptocurrency. I actually think it's an interesting concept and could easily become part of our current financial system. I just don't think bitcoin has much of a place outside of being nerd gold but with less utility. 
I just can't take any community seriously that thinks their chosen technological product is the be all and end all.. That's never been the case before, so I don't see why it would be now. The driving motivator behind peddling that narrative is the fact that people are invested in it.. 
In a subreddit full of investors, it's maybe a good idea to have people like me who aren't invested in any way. So you get a slightly less bias opinion. 
Basically, I'm the ying to your yang. 


I do care if I'm right. If I didn't then the philosophy in my posts would change depending on who/what I was arguing. It doesn't. It (should be) pretty consistent for the past 14 odd months I've been on here.

**Host country:** USA
**Home country:** Philippines

**Amount sent in host currency:** 250 USD
**Amount received in home currency:** 10,955 PHP
**Total cost:** 11,242.50 (actual exchange rate) - 10,955 (their exchange rate) = 287.5 PHP. In USD that is $6.39 or 2.556%
**Process followed:** There is no set fee for a 3 day transfer. They just make money on giving a shitty USD/PHP rate. The rate was 43.82 PHP = $1

Why do people think bitcoins = no taxes? 
It's no different than paying/being paid in cash and you still have to pay taxes on that income. They'll still shove you in prison if you don't. 
Your argument has nothing to do with bitcoin, and everything to do with just refusing to pay taxes. It hinges on the idea that if people started using bitcoins, they'd all also start evading tax..
I'm not really sure how you got to that conclusion.

I'm not convinced that the trustless system is better than the trust one we already have. 
With the trustless system (Bitcoin) I have to trust each merchant seperately. I have to do due diligence for every single site I wish to purchase from, which is a hell of a lot of sites. 
In reality, this would mean I'd just centralize trust as much as I could and stick to big name stores who have built up lots of trust. Amazon, etc. This would essentially give them a monopoly on my custom. 
The current system (EG Paypal/Square/Whatever) means I only have to trust one entity (EG Paypal) and then I don't have to trust any merchants. This is much more efficient and means I can buy from anywhere safe in the knowledge that I won't lose my money if the merchant is a scumbag. 
I've done my due diligence on Paypal and know they do good by the consumer. 
Bitcoin, imo, requires more trust. It seems odd to call it a trustless system.. Or at least misleading.

For Africa as a whole the per capita GDP (PPP) is ~$37.85 per week. 
In reality, some of the richer African countries are propping that figure up massively. It's less for most Africans. Much less. 
Imagine going up to an American in poverty and saying to them 'You need this leather wallet to put your money in before you can use your money. We'll need a week of your wages, and then a recurring payment each month.' 
They'd laugh you out of the room, but that's seriously what people on this subreddit are suggesting. We live in an ivory tower in the west, and when you have running water, electricity on demand, blanket cell phone reception and $30 to blow on lunch it's very easy to forget that those are luxuries in a lot of the world. 
Bitcoin is putting the cart before the horse. 
There's also the moral dilemma of a bunch of rich westerners itching at the idea of Bitcoin taking off in poor nations so that their own holdings will be worth more. It'd essentially be a huge wealth transfer from the poor African countries to the rich West, and to be honest we've been doing that for hundreds of years, and I'd like to see it stop.

But that's not the case, so any argument that requires that to be the case is bunk. 
You're correct, if everyone owned Bitcoin and not fiat then everyone would just transact in Bitcoin. But everyone doesn't, so they don't. 
You inadvertently made a case against Bitcoin. Everyone owns fiat, so why would they bother with Bitcoin?


Fiat without a doubt. 
If someone has a gun to my head and asks for my private keys then I'll give them to them. While next to me with the gun to my head he can transfer all my money to his address and then leave. I'm 100% shit out of luck. All my money is gone.

There's literally no difference between off chain transactions and the current banking systems in place. I'll never understand the boner gets for the whole idea of off-chain transactions. 
The exact same fees that are in place with our current favourite services (paypal, Square, amazon payments, etc) will exist in their bitcoin alternatives. 
The main expenses being staff, regulatory compliance and infrastructure. At the moment bitcoin companies are only able to be cheaper than existing companies because of the grey regulatory area they exist in and the fact a lot of them are absolutely tiny, processing as near as matters no volume..

Lol, your company doesn't even turn over $3,000 a month and you're worrying about a measly 3.95%?
For the uninitiated, Paypal charges 3.9% + 30 cents for the first $3,000 received per month. [Then the percentage gradually goes down in tiers.]( 
You should be concentrating on growing your turn over at this point. 3.95% of barely anything is barely anything.
You're also going to turn a lot of customers off when they get to the checkout and see this bullshit. Is losing customers really worth the maximum $118 saving per month?
My advice to you is plaster 'Free shipping' all over your site, increase prices by 3.95% (if you REALLY need to. You're doing such little turn over at the moment that you really shouldn't be putting your prices up and making yourself less competitive) plus shipping amount. 
Work out how much you should tack on each item for shipping by calculating the average number of items per sale, and then divide the average shipping cost by that. 
For the love of god don't do what you've mocked up in that image you posted. 
I'd leave a site if they did that to me 9 times out of 10 unless I can't get the service/product anywhere else.

That's just because the US commercial banking system is positively third world. In most of Europe domestic wires are free and instant, and international ones (SEPA) take 2 days at most.. That time will only go down as standardization takes hold.  
The BIGGEST thing holding back the banking system is a lack of standardization between countries, or even domestic banks. The easiest way to get banks to standardize within your own country is very simple, we did it in the UK. You just pass it into law. 
People over here were sick of banks purposely sitting on peoples money for 2-3 extra days and using it to earn them money. So we regulated the banks. 


The result was that the banks had to get their arse into gear or they'd start getting fined. They decided if they were going to do same day transfers they might as well make them instant, so they did. 
And that's why we now have instant free domestic bank transfers between banks in the UK. 
The point I'm trying to make is that the problem with banks isn't a technological one. It's a lack of will. 
Now, there's two ways to influence their will. Either you regulate and force their hand, or you introduce competition. You can argue that Bitcoin is such 'competition' but I would argue that regulation is much more efficient. 
In 4 years we went from having slow clunky bank transfers to instant free ones just using well thought out regulation. 
Bitcoins approaching it's 5th birthday and as far as I can tell the banks in the US have done nothing to change their ways. 
tl;dr Banks being shit is not a technological problem so it's unlikely to have a technological solution.

Bitcoin can't even hold at $1000 for more than a week or two, and it's down 50% from then anyway.. And you think that $127,000 is at all possible in just 2 years?
Orders of magnitude matter. The jump from 1-1000 isn't as big as the jump from 1000 to 127,000. You can't just say 'Oh well derp the percentages are similar...'

There's nothing inherently keeping fiat transactions costly. It's just the framework that built up around fiat which made it expensive.

Erm, US Treasury bonds are extremely popular. Japan and China each have more than 1.2 trillion dollars of them.. You've kind of proved my point for me. People will take the low return safe option if it exists. 


What exactly do you think an economy is? An economy IS spending.. If there's less of it, there's less of an economy. 


Those things make up a very small percentage of the economy. They're not enough to sustain our current living standards. Not by a long shot. 


So basically, only absolute sure things would get invested in? That's a terrible idea. There's plenty of huge and socially advantageous companies/inventions that sure as hell weren't a risk free investment when they first started. Hell, the internet wasn't even a sure thing. 
In your world, those technologies wouldn't have got funding and we'd not even have bitcoin because the internet wouldn't have been invested in.

The service doesn't exist yet, and the only service similar was Neo&amp;Bee so I'm a little skeptical. Also, ask yourself this. How will those companies make money. They need to make money somewhere. 
At the moment sites like Coinbase and Bitpay are beating the market because they're operating in a regulatory grey area. That gives them a huge advantage because they don't have to bother with complying to regulations, which is generally a costly endeavor. What happens when bitcoin banks/exchanges are regulated like normal banks/exchanges? We'll likely see a price increase, and in all honesty I don't think using any kind of Bitcoin service will be cheaper than using the fiat equivalent.  
Most money is just bits on a hard drive and has been for over a decade. The Bitcoin technology isn't where the savings are coming from, it's that regulatory grey area that's the money spinner. 
SWIFT is something like 10 cents per transaction, fyi. That's been in place for 30+ years, IIRC. If the killer app is the payment network, then Bitcoin is in trouble.

Their plan was to take peoples deposits in fiat, invest it in bitcoin, and then give the people back their balance in fiat when requested. 
So if bitcoin went up in price by 20%, NeoBee would make 20% off other peoples money. 
Essentially, they wanted to operate a fractional reserve. 
An unregulated fractional reserve is as scammy as it gets.

I've bought this up before in here and the answer has been a resounding 'no'.
Remember the community Bitcoin has attracted. A bunch of libertarians, essentially. The last thing they want is wealth distribution, unless it's into their pockets. 
Of course there's still plenty of concern trolling where people on here pretend to care about other countries citizens (Argentina today) in a cynical cash grab from a less well off nation. 
The only thing Bitcoin will achieve if poorer nations adopt it now would be a huge amount of wealth distribution from the poorest late adopters to the richest first world early adopters.

Bitcoin has minor consumer adoption. It's at least in the early to mid 90's at this point. 
It's a stupid comparison anyway. The fact the internet did well has zero bearing on if Bitcoin will/won't. 
Also, the barrier to entry for the internet was absolutely huge. Back in the early 90's you were looking at spending at least a month or more of wages to buy a computer to get yourself hooked up to the internet. Then you needed to pay your ISP by the minute... And it still overcame all of that. 
What is Bitcoins barrier to entry? Nothing. You need a phone or a computer, which the vast majority of people now have. And yet it's still floundering. 
The 'bitcoin is like internet' comparison is so far off base it's not funny. It's only parroted because of how big the Internet became, and it tricks stupid people into thinking Bitcoin will be that big.

Because for Transferwise that $4.5bn will be $4.5 genuine billion of money moved. From one person, to another. 
It's very hard to get a similar number for Bitcoin because there's no barrier to entry to making a transaction. If I send $400m of Bitcoin from an address I hold, to another address I hold.. That wasn't a transfer of value. But that'd count as $400m. 
Best guess would be to use Bitpays numbers. I think they did about $100m last year, and that was their biggest year. Most legitimate commerce will be through them.

* Richard Boase visited Kenya for 6 weeks
* He believes that the Bitcoin community only focusses on third world adoption as a means of increasing the value of their holdings, and not because it solves a problem the 3rd world actually experiences. 
* He believes that while Bitcoin solves a problem in the first world, in the third world there's much more pressing issues such as basic infrastructure such as water, sewage, education, internet and electricity. Bitcoin is like learning to run before you can walk.  One of the schools he visited needed a clock, for example. Simple things we take for granted. 
* People in third world nations can't afford to lose half their net worth due to currency fluctuations, whereas here in the first world we generally can. 
* By and large Kenyans use the united states dollar when stability is needed. 
* Due to high import taxes, the £60 tablets he was handing out to the charities were sometimes worth 6 months wages to the people he was handing them to. He believes that it makes more sense to sell the tablet and buy things they need, like a clock. 
* Director of a charity in Kenya said Bitcoin opens up a world of possibility when it comes to fraud, since there's no accountability and no way to confirm that your bitcoins are actually going to the charity. 
* The author thinks we live in ivory towers, and that we don't realise the real problems that face people living in these third world countries. 
* The author went to the post office and asked how much it would cost to send £100 to Kenya via traditional means and the price was £5. And £500 would cost £17. Which is a lot cheaper than any bitcoin related service. 
* He was genuinely moved by the experience and thinks his previous Bitcoin evangelicalism was silly.

Someone can put a gun to your head, get your private keys and then walk off into the distance. Security is not better with Bitcoin. Not even close.. That's why it gets stolen so often. 
Running away with a ton of gold is much much harder. And it's harder to shift once you have it too because everyone will be asking where you got it. 


Given that gold is usually just kept in huge vaults and gold is just assigned to people with paperwork, this is mostly irrelevant. You don't need to move it.


See above. Gold is infinitely divisible nowadays too, because it only gets divided on a computer, not physically. 


But easier to steal. Swings and roundabouts.

They're not giving money to the 1%.. That's not how QE works. 
Basically, the central bank prints some money (not literally) and then buys back government bonds off people. Generally banks. 
The banks don't make any more money than they would have by just holding onto the government bond until maturity. They're just forced to the reinvest that money that was previously tied up in the bond, and that (in theory) stimulates the economy.  
They buy other kinds of debt too, but bonds are just the easiest example to use.

They'd all need to match a real account, which is so unbelievably improbable that it's not worth mentioning. Otherwise it'd get put on hold and a call to your bank and probably a few days later you'd get your money back. 
If somehow you manage to get the wrong name, the correct sort code for that name and then also the correct account number for that name then things become a fair bit more difficult. But whinge and moan enough, the banks will have your back.

You realise that bitcoin is a saving of about 2% average, right? Bitcoin makes little to no sense when it comes to legal ecommerce. 
So I spend £3,000 of Bitcoin online and the 2% savings the merchant makes are passed onto me. I chose £3,000 because that's probably around the amount I spend online each year. 
That's a £60 saving. 
All it takes is one arsehole merchant to not send me my [giant black dildo]( and not return my calls/emails and I'm at a net loss. 
It's better to pay the extra 2% and have the buyer protection that cards offer. 
What if it wasn't a giant black dildo I got screwed on? What if it was a £300 TV? Then I've really lost out.

Surely the burden of proof is on you to give evidence that the 1% benefited the most from QE. You were the one who made the initial claim. 
Anyway, banks invest their money. Someone benefits from that investment. 
Whether it's me borrowing money at 4.5% to buy a house, or Jim down the road starting his Pizza business and borrowing start up capital @ 8%.. 
The banks don't just put the money on a spin of the roulette wheel.. It's a lot more complicated than that, and there's way more beneficiaries than you seem to think. 
I won't bother denying that the 1% probably do benefit the most.. But that's true of anything they do. It takes money to make money, everyone knows that.
That's not to say the 99% won't benefit too. Either via easy credit, or increased jobs, or whatever. There's a million and one benefit of banks having excess cash to loan out.

Bitcoin lost ~66% of its value in 10 months. In the same 10 month GBP lost about 1.5% of its value... And my bank account offers 1.75% on my savings so I'm 0.25% up in real terms.

You do pay a fee, it's just small. And you pay it rather than the merchant, so you're generally out more money than you would be when using traditional systems unless the merchant offers a discount, which the majority don't.

It's not the same. You put money in a savings account and the bank you're with invests/trades with it, then give you a fixed amount of returns regardless of their returns.

There's no need to actually buy and hold significant amounts of Bitcoins to promote the technology. 
You can buy as you need them on sites like coinbase/circle and then use them.. It's easyish now. It's been easyish for most of 2014. 
The **only** reason to hold a significant amount is as a speculative asset. You don't need $10,000 in Bitcoin just to buy the humble bundle now and again, or throw $15 at wikipedia..
Everyone who holds a lot of Bitcoin and says it's to promote the technology is lying through their fucking teeth and selling snake oil.

We have this in the UK, kinda. 
Our biggest ISP is BT. They set up two wireless networks on your access point. One public, one private. 
If you allow people to access the public one, you get access to all the other public ones. 
The result is that at least in cities you're never really out of range of one. 
The incentive to do it is that you get access to something like 5 million wireless access points. 
IIRC, it's opt-out though which is a bit scummy. But then again, there's almost blanket wifi coverage across the UK because of it soooo... Swings and roundabouts.

Why wouldn't they accept Bitcoin if no one wants to hold any? I don't follow your logic.

But my argument is that the Internet comparison is extremely flawed as Bitcoin has zero financial barrier to entry (in the USA at least)..
Almost everyone has a phone/computer nowadays that could run a Bitcoin wallet. There's 3G reception pretty much everywhere.. The conditions are perfect and yet.. Er. No on cares. 
There was a 20 year period between the internet being invented and it becoming popular where you couldn't use it even if you wanted to. Unless you were a university, no chance. 
Bitcoin has a higher barrier to entry than twitter/facebook, but a much much much lower barrier to entry than the internet did. 
You'd be better off comparing them to facebook/twitter than the Internet, but it'd still be a flawed comparison. Bitcoin is its own thing.

* EC658 We will gradually establish legal ways for companies to be transformed into mutual organisations, such as consumer or worker cooperatives in specified circumstances if a sufficient majority of the relevant workers or customers agree. Existing shares will be converted into non-voting equity or loan stock. One important initial circumstance when this might be done is upon the sale of a small business or upon the death or retirement of the owner. Another initial application might be to football or other sporting clubs where a majority of the season ticket holders, supported by the wider local community, might want to bring a local club into mutual ownership. In the longer run we would envisage some process of this kind applying, with appropriate safeguards, to all companies.
* CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.
* EN261 We will cancel construction of new nuclear stations and nuclear power will not be eligible for government subsidy; the Green Party opposes all nuclear power generation and is particularly opposed to the construction of new nuclear power stations
* TR310 Vehicles would not be permitted for road use that had the ability to travel at greater speeds than the majority of EU national maximum speed levels

None of that explains why I got the figures I just got, though. Looks like the author only compared exchange rate in the last segment and forgot to factor in the 3% BitPesa charges, whereas WU only charges £2.90 on a £500 transaction. Which is way less than 3%. 
For micro amoutns, BitPesa looks like it makes sense. But for regular large amounts (aka with each pay cheque) it doesn't seem to beat even the most costly service, WU. 
Anyone got any figures on how much the average remittance is? I'm guessing it's usually a % of peoples pay cheque each week/month and therefore on the larger side.

If the bank took 11% out of my pay cheque mid month, that would affect me pretty heavily. It'd be the difference between being able to go out with mates and have fun that month, and not.

Banks could quite easily make money transfer a loss leader if needs be and undercut bitcoin. That's the advantage of being a business, you can allow on part of your company to lose money hand over fist as long as it gets customers in and you get money from them elsewhere. 
The bitcoin protocol, however, doesn't have that option. How else are miners going to claw back costs if they start processing transactions for free? They can't. They're just a node on the network. 
At the moment it's subsidized by mining.

Uber CEO: Can't? Can't?! Oh lord no, don't say that. Why oh why?
Uber exec: Sir, we're currently battling taxi firms. 
Uber CEO: I know, I know! But, Bitcoin!
Uber exec: Sir we just can't. I'm just so very sorry to tell you we can't possibly adopt Bitcoin while we're arguing with taxi firms. As you know, big multinational companies worth billions of dollars can only ever do one very specific thing at once. Since we're battling taxi companies currently every single member of staff is concentrating on that. 
Uber CEO: Is there really no one to spare? You realise we don't have Bitcoin support, right? There's literally almost a million people world wide who can only pay with their debit cards and not their bitcoin. Do you have any idea of the incredible inconvenience they're going through by having to put in 12 numbers, their name and their address? It's not even worth thinking about.

The things is, you seem to be banking on some kind of huge shift in thinking or something. Like everyone is going to adopt *your* money ideology. 
It's just not going to happen. People don't change unless there's a reason to change.. Bitcoin has to actually offer a tangible benefit and 6 years in the only tangible benefit seems to be the darknet markets. 
They're the only thing that Bitcoin has truly enabled people to do, which they wanted to do but couldn't. 
Sure, there's some nifty techno shit that Bitcoin can do. Smart contracts, coloured coins, yadda yadda. But it means nothing to anyone outside of the Bitcoin community. 
They want a tangible reason to bother, and no one's giving it to them. 
Even Bitcoin remittance services are only marginally better value, sometimes.. 
The problem Bitcoin suffers from is that a lot of stuff would become easier if everyone had a worldwide accepted digital currency of some kind. 
But there's no real incentive to jump on the bandwagon. Is it a catch 22? Or a paradox, or something else. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:50:48


I understand the technology perfectly well. In a business sense, none of that matters at all. The banks have had ways of verifying funds since forever. A trustless system is only really beneficial when you have no idea who you're sending to. Banks can work on a trust system because they do billions upon billions of dollars worth of business with each other, and they don't want to kill the goose that's laying the golden egg. 
The reason I mentioned that it's all just bits on a hard drive is because I was trying to highlight that in simple terms the ability to transfer money between banks has been technologically frictionless for years now. Generally the biggest friction encountered is regulatory and differing standards. But banks have been spending billions in the past decade or so to get rid of all the differing standards and develop their own, which they hope all banks will accept. The stragglers, well, if they're not willing to integrate with the other banks then they're even less likely they'll attempt to integrate bitcoin. 
You could argue that Bitcoin is the standard they've been looking for, but the fact that many people who have nothing to do with the bank hold bitcoins and have influence in its function is a bad thing in the eyes of banks. They could get the exact same utility from just creating their own alt coin to use in their backend systems. There's absolutely no advantage to using bitcoin, though.

How does that work, exactly? These things have to connect to the internet. If they have to connect to the internet, then they need some kind of user interaction to get them connected to the wifi. 
They could, in theory, connect to the laptop via a data link and then back out to the internet using the laptop wifi.. But that's complicated and anyone with wireshark would be able to see what's going on and kick up a stink. 
You're literally talking about all this work to collect penny shavings over periods of years. 
They risk:
1) Chips being defective as they're unproven tech, requiring warranty returns.
2) Consumer backlash, for what is essentially electricity bill malware being forced on them. 
3) Government backlash, as we're trying to move to more energy efficient devices. Not less. Lots of governments have green targets and have been working to keep energy efficiency climbing. I can absolutely imagine the EU making this shit illegal, for example. 
It woudn't take many of either one of those points to come true to completely offset any earnings from the miners. 
It's just an all around shitty idea. It **will** never go anywhere, I guarantee it. A company thought 'Right, we've got a problem where to mine we have to buy hardware and electricity. Is there any way we can make other people buy the hardware and electricity, but we get the bitcoins?'

CCTV is extremely useful. If you're actually interested beyond just parroting catch phrases (I'd bet money you've never read 1984) then give this a watch:
It shows how the police solve a random stabbing. A stabbing where everyone got away, and the stabbers got the wrong man. An almost impossible case, if it weren't for CCTV. 
 is the relevant 5 minutes or so. But it's worth watching the whole thing to get an idea of how CCTV helps a great deal. 
Also, I really don't get the hate CCTV gets because CCTV can absolve me of any wrong doing. Eye witnesses are incredibly unreliable, whereas CCTV is less so. What if some idiots put me at a crime scene? I'd be thankful if there was CCTV there to prove it wasn't me. 
Lastly, pretty much all the CCTV the police view in that video is privately held by shops/pubs. It's not some big network with an ominous 'controller'.. It's just people putting a camera outside their business because they want the protection it offers them. They can put that little 'Smile, you're on CCTV' sticker on the door and hopefully scare criminals away. And if not, they can get them caught by showing the police the CCTV.

If I was to hazard a guess it's because gsm text message capability is available pretty much everywhere, and GPRS/3G isn't. Bitcoin relies on a data connection, which many can't afford and even if they can it's not a available as simple GSM. 
Also M-Pesa is simple as shit to use, and Bitcoin is extremely difficult in comparison. 
And because M-Pesa works via text messages, a $5 Nokia will allow you to use it. Not a $100 android smart phone. 
The wild price swings also aren't particularly desirable when you're as poor as some of the third world is. The common saying round these parts is still 'invest as much as you can afford to lose'.. Well in the third world that amount is often $0. And not can't afford as in 'Oh no, I can't buy those trainers I want because Bitcoins price fell.' more like 'Oh, I can't buy food this week because Bitcoins price fell...'

Youtube had $5.6bn in revenue in 2013, and I can't find more recent figures. I know the 1 billion unique users stat above is relatively new this year. Presumably their revenue has grown. 
So assuming 25 cents per user, youtube would make $3bn a year. 
So they'd lose $2.6bn a year. 
Seems like a bit of a non starter. It'd need to be 50 cents a month. So $6 a year. I'm not sure I'd pay $6 a year for no ads when adblock does the job. 
I'm not sure paywalls are the way forward for websites. I think ads are just going to have to become more hidden. Newspapers have adapted similarly. Now you'll get sponsored articles that look just like normal articles, but they're about a specific product.

But if it was created when Bitcoin was worth $4 then it was created before there was a reason to be jealous, no? 
I don't really get the jealousy claim when it comes to I'm not jealous. I'm envious of users like dogecoin-billionaire who literally became a millionaire completely by accident because he tried and failed to buy drugs online using Bitcoin in 2010. 
But I'm envious of him in the same way I'm envious of people winning the euromillions. It was luck. It's all been luck. 
If I'd bought in in early 2013 I'd have made a profit, but again. It would have been all luck. Not fundamentals, or the technology, or wall street money or any of the things this sub has been parroting about Bitcoin. Just blind luck, and it could have gone either way. I could have lost everything. 
I was originally interested in the tech and general concept, but then I started getting downvoted for reasonable discussion of Bitcoins flaws and then that pissed me off. I soon realised that this experiment is unlikely to last when the vast majority of its users are evangelical about it. 
Then I looked into deflation theory and quickly came to the conclusion that the founding idea is a dud. 
I think Bitcoin will continue to be used for quite a while on the darknet markets. But it'll never get mainstream adoption. Mainstream adoption is nothing but an illusion to mask the fact that the vast majority of actual Bitcoin commerce is done on the darkmarkets. 
I also have a hunch that the vast majority of Bitpay/Coinbases volume is fake ecommerce shops set up by darknet vendors to cash out their proceeds easily. 
But Bitcoin can serve the dark markets at $10 just as well as it can at $250. The price is mostly irrelevant to everyone but the holding masses. 
The whole thing is a house of cards, imo. Now we're just waiting for the evangelical bag holders to lose their faith. Today on we've seen quite a bit of that.

Simply being able to buy shit with Bitcoin isn't enough. It needs to be more convenient and/or useful than current payment methods. 
So it needs to be better than cash/card. There has to be a **reason** to use Bitcoin. 
In the darkmarkets a huge amount of bitcoin commerce takes place. Probably more than legitimate Bitcoin commerce. Why? Because Bitcoin is the only choice. No banks will touch them, and for good reason. 
That's an example of a problem being solved with Bitcoin. 
Buying gas and groceries isn't. No one has trouble buying gas and groceries now.. 
A 'build it and they will come' approach is flawed when it comes to Bitcoin. It needs to offer people a tangible benefit over current systems, and not just niche philosophical/ideological benefits..

You should always book flights/holidays with a credit card. The buyer protection it affords you is absolutely invaluable, imo. 
Holiday companies and airlines are extremely volatile companies. A drastic increase in the price of oil can sink small airlines, and if you book a long time in advance then the risk is bigger. 
It's even worse with small travel agents. They seem to go under all the time. 
So yeah, all you're doing by booking with bitcoin and then buying the bitcoin back with your credit card is forfeiting your buyer protection. Makes no sense.

It doesn't change anything. How often do you actually want to give a stranger half way around the world $4? Almost never. The only reason you're doing it is to try and prove a point, not because there's a use case for it. 
The guy above is correct. Email has a clear and evident advantage over snail mail.. Bitcoin doesn't have that advantage over paypal/mastercard/visa/square/google wallet. 
Imagine you're trying to sell the idea of Bitcoin to someone:
**Me:** With Bitcoin you can send *money* over the *internet* instantly, and for free! 
**Them:** Er, haven't I been doing that for 15+ years now? 
**Me:** Well no! You see, Bitcoin is a decentralized ledger that-
**Them:** What does it do other than send money? I've been doing that for 15 years without problem. 
**Me:** Well... Er.. ^^Banks ^^are ^^bad...

Not him, but I do wire money to friends from time to time. It takes about 5 seconds using my banks phone app. And it's free. And it's instant. 
That's because my countries domestic banking is actually structured well and the regulations in place are there to benefit the consumer. 
The technology isn't the problem. We've had the ability to send money instantly for decades.. The problem is the regulatory environment. 
Here in the UK domestic transfers used to take days.. The government said 'Er, that's not on. Make domestic transfers clear in under 24 hours. You have 2 years to get your shit together. Oh, and stop charging people..' and since they were creating a brand new system anyway, they made it instant because it was really no harder and creating one that takes 23 hours and 59 minutes.

That's an interesting way of putting it, but it doesn't sit right with me. 
You're holding, and limiting supply. You're saying this is worth more to me than you're willing to spend. 
But that doesn't make it so.. That doesn't actually make them worth more. The demand must be there. 
And then conversely people not willing to buy it are also declaring that it's not worth what you think it is. 
And of course, this is all extremely skewed by the fact that a lot of bitcoiners have completely unrealistic expectations of the future value of their bitcoins. 
I feel we're getting somewhat off topic, though. I don't think making a declaration that you think something is more valuable than it is is much of a positive economic action.

Do you at least understand that offchain transactions have nothing to do with Bitcoin and that Bitcoin can be safely removed entirely from the equation if needs be? 
For example, when a 'bitcoin' transaction takes place from a coinbase consumer account to a coinbase merchant account it's literally no different to paypal in its functionality. Fiat money leaves the consumers bank account, goes to coinbase and coinbase then sends the fiat money to the merchants bank account. 
Bitcoin's not touched anywhere.. Its branding could be removed entirely from that scenario and it'd just look like a paypal clone.

And yes, bank transfers up to £10,000 are free and available instantly between any bank in the UK. By the beginning of next year you'll be able to send up to £250 for free by just using a mobile number as a destination (PayM).. Most banks have signed up to PayM already, there's just a few stragglers. This isn't a government initiative, it's voluntary. 
It's meant as an easy way to pay IOU's, essentially.

Biggest transaction I've ever done was £80,000 and it cost me £30.. I'm not going to adopt Bitcoin because it might save me £30 once every 20 years.. There needs to be an every day realistic use case for the masses if it stands a chance.

Offchain is just bitcoiner double speak for 'not using bitcoin'.. An offchain transaction is just a 3rd party processor with its own ledger. They could be transacting in shillings, moon rocks or pubes for all it matters..

Well yes. When you don't use Bitcoin it's very easy to avoid the problems of Bitcoin. 
Offchain transactions are the biggest red herring in the Bitcoin community. They allow for everything you guys hate, including fractional reserve bitcoin-ing.

Biggest issue for me is that he calculated our GDP PPP against the entire USA's GDP PPP but then he compared to individual states. 
That's not a like for like comparison because the cost of living between states in the USA is vastly different. Someone in California will have a high cost of living, whereas someone in... Well, I'll be honest. I don't know enough about the USA to pick out a low cost of living state. 
But you get the point. 
If you're going to compare out PPP adjusted GDP to states, you also have to PPP adjust those states GDP's. 
It's apples and oranges the way he did it. Completely flawed methodology and exactly what I expected after he said he'd done original research and that it was 'straightforward'..

What's stopping people from just buying Bitcoin on coinbase and leaving it in their coinbase account? Last I checked they had a vault option, and their track record is better than whoever is starting this fund/whatever. 
I don't really think it's very difficult at all to get money into Bitcoin nowadays if you want to. I think the biggest 'problem' is that no one really wants to. 
This might possibly give Bitcoin some legitimacy, but then again it might also backfire because if real investors see it going up or down by 10-20% a week regularly they're going to just laugh at it and anyone who asks about it.

But Mastercard/visa don't lend anyone any money. The issuing banks do. 
So if you get a BoA Mastercard credit card, it's BoA that is setting the APR, taking the risk and lending the money. 
Mastercard just facilitate the payment.. Just like they do with debit cards.
BoA never sees any of that transaction fee that Mastercard gets. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:16:35
Eh, I'll have a go at tackling this post for all the good it'll do.. 
Generally, people do spend their money as fast as possible. Whether we're putting it into 401K's, savings accounts or buying a house and car. 
These are all economically useful actions. Money sitting in a savings account gaining 2% interest is serving a use. The banks are using that money to invest in businesses in the hopes of getting a return.. That's loosely what they're doing anyway, it's a lot more complicated than that but it's not all that important for my argument.  
So putting your money in a savings account is an economically positive action. It helps stimulate the economy in some small way.. Not as much as actually buying something does, but it's still a help of a kind.  
Now removing your money from your savings account and putting it under your mattress is at best an economically neutral action. The money is doing nothing. It's sitting there helping no one, growing no businesses, gathering no interest. It might as well not exist. 
That is what having Bitcoin in cold storage is.. It's putting money under your mattress. It's an economically pointless action.. 
It serves a purpose in that it limits supply of Bitcoins, so if demand stays the same the price will increase the supply is constantly limited by people hoarding. 
But in the end it's still economically neutral since at some point you will exchange those bitcoins for something and that will increase supply and exert negative pressure on the price. 
At best you're doing fuck all to help the Bitcoin economy, at worst you're actively preventing the Bitcoin economy growing. 
The only way Bitcoins can truly be worth more tomorrow than they are today is if demand grows.
Artificially limiting supply by hoarding isn't really doing any long term good.

None of that has anything to do with differing transaction costs, though. 
Transacting with a credit and a debit card is no different. Who the money comes from is the only difference, but those people offering the credit make their money on the APR anyway..
A card is a card at the end of the day. Where the money is coming from is of no concern of the payment processor, yet they charge more for credit cards..


And to make a profit.

Yes. And it barely processes 2 transactions per second. 
It's incredibly wasteful. 
Visa alone does something like 10,000 a second, and bursts to way higher than that. As a percentage of transactions, Bitcoin has an incredibly tiny market share.. Yet it still uses 0.2% of the power the entire banking system does, which is serving way more people and doing way more work than Bitcoin is.

International transfers, maybe. But then there's services like transferwise that are pro at that too. 
Bitcoins biggest advantage at the moment is the regulatory grey area it operates in. 
It's like Uber in the London. All taxi drivers have to memorize all the road names in London, have a special car, abide by all these regulations and then Uber doesn't have to do any of that shit and can charge half the price for the exact same service.

I can see the passion and ideological interest in BC, but that shouldn't be the basis of an investment strategy.
I don't really understand the purpose of holding and not spending large amount of bitcoins. 
Lots of people claim they're supporting bitcoin by doing that, but how? What positive economic effect does it have? 
At most it artificially limits supply. That's it. 
If you want to support the Bitcoin economy then holding does absolutely nothing.. Buy bitcoin when you need it, and then spend it. 
I wish people were more honest about this bitcoin malarkey. Really they're just hoping to be holding a lot of Bitcoin at the next price spike.. It has absolutely nothing to do with 'supporting bitcoin' because their action is economically neutral, or maybe even detrimental.

That's an unrealistic scenario which isn't really worth discussing. Very very few people have £250,000 to drop on buying a house outright. 
The better scenario is this. 
You have to live somewhere. You earn £2000 after tax each month. The price of rent in the area you live is £1200, the price of a mortgage on an equivalent house in that area is £1000 per month.
Which do you choose? 
You choose the one with less expenditure. It also has the added advantage that after 25 years you no longer have to make payments because you own your house.

I still don't really understand how, as an internet payment system, bitcoin is 'so much better' than alternatives. 
The biggest advantage over paypal seems to be the smaller fees, but for the smaller fees you get an almost infinitely smaller customer base and a slightly more clunky experience due to the still unrefined bitcoin purchasing systems in place. 
The thing is, the fees paypal charge are just what they can currently get away with. Paypal could quite easily lower their fees to 1.5% or less and still make loads of money. It could even become a loss leader since it's such an integral part of ebay.

There's no business argument to be made for implementing bitcoin unless bitcoin users are already your target demographic. 
Bitcoin implementation is better as a marketing tool than anything else at the moment. You add bitcoin as a payment option and suddenly it's completely acceptable to spam your site on every bitcoin forum, and even better the users won't hate you! They'll love you.

To expand on this, would they even need to do that? Could they not buy up something like 30% then shut it off all at once. Then the difficulty would be high and a lot of miners would feel that it was unprofitable to keep mining. They might end up having cash flow problems and being forced to shut their miners down. 
Then it's just a cascading effect. 
Miners shut off their machines because difficulty is too high and it's taking too long to mine blocks. Them doing that makes it even harder for the rest of the people. 
If there isn't an increase in the price of bitcoin during this time then it would become even less worth it for miners to continue.

It's value as a currency is more like $10 if you take into account the relatively low merchant throughput of payment gateway companies like bitpay and coinbase. 
Companies like Reddit and Wordpress barely get any transactions in bitcoin. IIRC Wordpress made a couple hundred dollars of bitcoins in 6 months. 
It's completely overhyped a currency. It's currently acting a lot more like gold than it is acting like a currency. A store of wealth and an investment vehicle. 
However unlike gold, the intrinsic value of bitcoin at the moment is the promise of great things in the future. If they don't come to fruition then the value will be lost. 
Gold doesn't have promises of anything. It is what it is, and people know that. They understand the fundamentals. 
Bitcoin has so many parallels with gold. I don't understand why people think it can be used as a currency. Everyone moved away from the gold standard for a reason.
It can never work as a currency. It's a good gold replacement/accompaniment.

You'll be downvoted, but you're right. At 10% fees you'd need to sell $50,000 worth to recoup. 10% is a bullshit fee, so lets say 5% so people will actually consider using it. Now you need to sell $100,000 worth. 
I just don't think there's that much demand in any single physical location (Bitcoin conferences excluded for obvious reasons) to justify buying one as a business. I can only really see shop owners who like the *idea* of bitcoin buying one for their shop.. Not for any business reasons, just because of ideology and wanting to spread the use of bitcoin. 
tl;dr as an investment or business these are absolutely terrible, except in the most fringe of cases

Fair enough, but I imagine Wikipedia like to receive money. 
Time and time again sites implement bitcoin and then no one fucking donates/buys stuff using bitcoin. 
Reddit and Wordpress spring to mind. 
We're forever being promised a killer app for bitcoin but 5 years on it's still not here. Nearest thing is bitcoin gambling sites. Still not much of a killer app when in most of the world you can gamble online easily using fiat. 
Until there's a killer app for bitcoin, there's really not much point in businesses implementing it on their site. Not enough people hold bitcoin for it to be worth it. Plus if someone wants something and the vendor doesn't accept bitcoin, they'll just use their debit/credit card instead. It's not like anyone's losing customers over not implementing bitcoin. 
How many people on here still use Amazon? Exactly. 
People on here like to pretend that they won't buy anything online unless it can be bought with bitcoins (for that delicious circlejerk karma. YUM) but the reality of the situation is that if you had that policy there'd be very little you could buy online.

From what I've heard Santander are pretty rubbish. That's why they give you £100 to join. That should really be a warning sign to anyone. 
I got trapped by that with Halifax. £100 sign up bonus. 'Might as well!' I thought. 
I switched back after a month. Awful bank.
Natwest is the shit and their iPhone app is amazing. No card? Log onto the iPhone app, click 'get cash' and get a 8 digit pin to put in at natwest cash machines. Then you can withdraw without your card. Very cool. 
Plus they charge barely anything for overdrafts.

One of the biggest mistakes young people make is thinking that change happens in eureka moments. It doesn't and never has. It's a gradual process.

They wanted change, they wanted it all in one go and they got fuck all as a result.
Even past events/ideas that seem revolutionary took ages. Marxism took 75 odd years until people finally gave it a go in the form of communism.

Both are absolutely astronomical numbers.
2.5 is a small deceiving number. It helps readers forget what you're actually talking about. 
The real number that matters is the $100tn number. 
Written out, that's $100,000,000,000,000.
So 2.5% of that number is $2,500,000,000,000
49,946,058 is the number of average US households it would take to earn that amount of money in a year. Average US household income is ~$50,000. 
$2,500,000,000,000 is roughly the entire GDP of the UK with its 64 million people. 
$2,500,000,000,000 is 62,306 metric tons of gold. That's a bit heavier than the [USS Fottestal](

I put it down to the US being bigger and having a larger population. Still, you'd think that some progress would have been made in the past 10 years or so. Certainly more progress than has been made. Cheques are still common place, ffs. 
I don't even have a cheque book. I don't think any stores still take cheques and they especially don't without a debit card with a cheque guarantee hologram on it.. At which point the whole thing is pointless because you have to have your debit card on you. 
Direct debits and standing orders are what I use for everything. Never late with a payment, completely hands off and manageable online if needed. 
If I ever need to send money to a friend I just wire it for free. 
I think this is why I feel bitcoin doesn't really add much at the moment, and might never. It seems more like nerd gold than a usable currency.

You don't, because the claims are correct. The price is entirely based on future predicted utility and not current utility. Therefore it IS speculative whether you like it or not.

For the consumer bitcoin is a nightmare. It basically removes all protection from the consumer. 
A seller can run with your money and there's no recourse. 
Paypal is 100x better (not even hyperbole) for the consumer at the moment. You have superb protection when paying with paypal. 
The consumer is who a currency/payment portal should protect. The seller is what bitcoin (currently) protects. 
Completely backwards.

Better theory. 
You create a company and tell the bitcoin community that you're going to make an ASIC miner. You ask for pre orders, limited amount available. 
You build the ASIC miners with the peoples money and start mining. Once they start to become much less useful and have mined you a shit load of BTC you ship them claiming that you've only just finished making them. 
You have the money the people paid for the miners, plus thousands upon thousands of bitcoins you mined.
It's hilarious that people keep fooling for it.

Define quickly? At a blanket 5% fees for transactions it would need to turnover $400,000 before it breaks even. Not to mention you'd need to rent space for it to sit, so that cuts into your profits too. There's probably a handful of places where this is an investment that will pay for its self and start generating a profit. Even then I think it'd take years.

Pretty sure any in the UK. I know for a fact Natwest can. 
I think £15,000 (~$25K) is the limit in a single payment but I think you can do multiple payments in the same day. 
That's international too (free to approx 30 countries in Europe) by SEPA, however it's likely the bank you're sending to will charge the person you're sending to to convert from GBP to EUR. If they have a GBP account then this isn't a problem.

Anyone who doesn't think bitcoin is overvalued is fucking delusional. The fundamentals haven't changed since last year, only the hype and price has. 
We've got a couple of franchises of subway accepting bitcoin, a single ATM in Canada and a few niche eCommerce sellers making a tiny fraction, if anything, in bitcoin sales. There's very little evidence that anyone is spending bitcoin in any noteworthy amounts or frequency. Bitpay did 6,296 transactions on Black friday. That's nothing. 
For reference, in 2010 Amazon did 151 sales PER SECOND on black friday. Amazon has a market cap of $175bn.
If bitcoin was a payment processing VC startup they'd have wound it down by now.

In 3rd world countries internet coverage is shite. That's where bitcoins are the least useful. Not to mention that they're inflationary as standard. For someone in the west spending a bitcoin even though you know it's going to be worth $10 more next month isn't a big deal.

Secondly, even if I do take that mental leap into the abyss with you the example still doesn't make sense. People kick Heroin addictions every day. It's hard, but it can be done. 


For now it is, somewhat. But it can be weaned off of it. Hell, my country (UK) did £375m worth of Quantitative Easing from 2009-2012 and has no plans for any more. Our economy is now growing fine and we're actually doing better than most in Europe.

Takes longer, mostly because we have to interface with their shitty banking systems and regulations. There's no technological reason they can't be instant. It's all regulatory for the most part. Regulations that bitcoin services will need to adhere to as well. 


You really should have kept reading on the wiki page you got that from:


Maybe I should have said 'Barely anyone pays fees on ATM's' but it's really semantics. In practice, withdrawing money is free. That's the point I was making. 


True enough, but the point is that we already have them. Bitcoin will need to play catch up. 


What banks charge the consumer for direct debits and standing orders?


Free at point of service. Actually, I pay for mine but that's because they give me an extra percent on my savings, phone insurance, car breakdown cover, travel insurance and extended gadget warranty. It's worth the £10 a month or whatever. I pretty much make that back on my savings percent increase.

You think consumers will put up with that? What world do you live on? 
Okay, I'm a consumer. The business wants *my* custom so that they can make money. What incentive is there for me to use bitcoin? 
* No chargebacks is not a plus, it's a negative. Now I have to search online and look for reviews. As anyone knows online reviews of sites are generally negative no matter what because very few people post a review unless something went wrong. 
* Lower fees. Possibly a positive as long as the business passes the savings onto the consumer. Even then, is a few percent less on the RRP really worth the 'no chargebacks' issue? We're literally talking about 1.5% or so difference. Not worth it. Only worth it on larger purchases ($1000+) but then with bigger purchases I want *even better* consumer protection, not less! 
Your arguments aren't taking into account the reality of the situation. If bitcoin ever gets big, all these features will be incorporated. The consumers aren't going to go backwards when it comes to features, and without consumer support the companies won't be making any money. Can't make money if no one's buying your shit.

@_date: 2013-11-22 14:11:17
Well the argument is often that bitcoin will reduce the cost of goods since merchants can accept a discount. 
However if the consumer it just charged somewhere else instead it's a zero sum game. 
You might save 1% off a purchase with the retailer, but if they had to pay 1% more to get bitcoins then no one's benefited. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:51:09

But I'm saying you don't need to know jack about the underlying processes to make that assessment and I imagine many many bitcoin users don't. 
There's just some key features you need to know. 
I don't think a lack of cryptography knowledge excludes people from making comment on bitcoin. I think, for reasons posted above, it's mostly irrelevant when discussing bitcoin as a currency since so few people understand cryptography. 
If few people understand it, it will not play a big part in the success of the currency.

Leading theory, imo, is that Chinese people are getting around their governments capital controls by buying bitcoin on a chinese exchange, transferring to an American exchange and then selling for dollars. 
There's a reason China hasn't reacted to negative news such as coin validation. It's because it doesn't matter to them at all. 
This is the most sane theory I can come up with. There's basically been no change in utility for the past month and a bit to warrant this increase. 
Think about it, the Chinese want the bitcoins so they can get their money into dollars and into a foreign bank account. 
The Americans think Bitcoin is about to become the worlds new de facto currency, ushering in the demise of the dollar and the evil banking system. So they hold. They hold, because they think big things are to come. 
The Chinese just want their fucking money out of China. The thing is, supply is low because all the fucking Americans are holding on for the Moon. 
This increases the price because as we all know, when supply is low (everyone holding) and demand is high (All the chinese people want to get their money out of china) then the price will increase. 
Basic supply and demand economics. 
China don't really care what the price of one bitcoin is since it's just an instrument to covert their money. 
So there you go. That's my opinion on what's going on. 
It's essentially a misunderstanding of motives. 
There could be a problem if Americans stop buying bitcoin, or the chinese government realises what's going down. 
They're easing up on capital controls anyway, so in a few years people might be able to just get their money out of China the old fashioned way, at which point bitcoin will have served its purpose for the Chinese. 
That could cause a correction.

The problem I see is that if I walked up to 100 people in the street and asked them if transfer fees and bank account freezing has ever negatively impacted their lives I'm almost certain I wouldn't get anyone claiming they had. I have the advantage of living in the UK, though, and we don't have transfer fees within the EU. Regardless I don't think the average punter ever has to deal with account closures or freezing. I don't think it's a big enough problem. 
Plus, what about services they do use from banks? Overdrafts, loans, mortgages, credit cards. You and I might think those things are bad, but for your average person they're useful services. How does bitcoin help them with that? I mean if we're absorbing the vibe of this forum we're meant to believe that Bitcoin is a replacement for the whole monetary system. It's a paradigm shift. 
How does bitcoin even facilitate lending when it's deflationary by nature? Lending is a very important part of the world.


Certainly a possibility. The examples I used were just high profile companies that the bitcoin community campaigned to get to accept bitcoin. They campaigned, then barely any of them actually put their money where their mouth was. I really really want dropbox to start accepting bitcoin and then give out their figures after 6 months. I suspect the exact same thing would happen. 
There's also the problem bitcoin has with relatively small number of people holding an awful lot of bitcoins due to early adoption advantage. They'd just become the ruling class. It's secretly what a lot of people on here want. They talk the altruistic talk, but as soon as the price starts climbing you see their true colours and the dollar signs in their eyes. They don't hate the current system, they hate that they're not at the top of the current system and they realise that maybe they could be at the top of the next system. 
I've used the term crowd sourced pump and dump before, and that's often what it feels like while reading bitcoin forums.

This fucks the customer so hard. It's the customer you should be protecting. 
The customer now had no recourse for shitty service and I don't see why anyone who was buying something would use bitcoins over paypal. All it does is screw them. 
The customer doesn't care about retailer protection. I want to give a retailer $20 and I want a fucking tshirt in return. If I don't get the t-shirt I want to know that I can get that $20 back. I don't want to know that they can keep that $20 regardless. 
This is a dumb argument. A very dumb argument.

It wouldn't work to insure BTC for BTC.
You'd have to insure the BTC for the market rate in fiat at the time of theft. You'd just pay out dollars in the event of a problem. 
It's the only way it would be workable.

That was the first order with bitcoin. It was what, $7? So they saved 30 cents and 3% on that order at best. 51 cents. 
It would take around 100 orders before the tablet would pay for its self. 
Unless he thinks he's going to get 100 orders in a reasonable amount of time it's not worth the investment.

Cryptocurrencies are probably the future, but not bitcoin. 
I sometimes feel the people here don't really hate the current system, they just hate that they're at the bottom of the current system. They see bitcoins success as a way to be at the top of the next system and that's why they champion it so and hope for 'TO THE MOON!' to come true..

No, you are wrong. It doesn't matter where the company resides, you still need to charge VAT.


Buying a bitcoin is not a 'financial transaction' in the UK, it's a seen as a 'single purpose voucher' and is therefore taxed at 20% VAT.
They wouldn't have to if their turnover was under £70K a year, but that seems unlikely.

Not necessarily. They could salt and hash a bunch of variations of your password. 
Letter 1, 3 and 6 gets its own hash. 
Letter 2, 5 and 6 gets its own hash. 
Etc. 
Then store them and call on them when needed during login. It basically helps the most against phishing attacks because when a user sees that they have to put in their whole password this time they'll be confused and hopefully won't follow through.

Yeah, adoption is slow but steady. Only places I've used it has been fast food places. 
It certainly only suits certain types of businesses due to the limits put in place (£20 for my bank) to minimize liability when it comes to fraud. Places that sell low ticket items, and lots of them.. That's the businesses that generally have NFC payments. 
NFC certainly does make it easier to commit minor fraud if someone steals your card, though. Not sure what's being done about that other than the spending limit. 
[This looks interesting too...]( Looks like they're getting ready for when phones have NFC built in. I'd love to be able to pay using my phones NFC.

In the UK the limit is £85K, but that's per bank rather than per person. 
So as long as you split it up into a bunch of banks, you'd be protected. Not sure if it's the same rules in the US, but it might be.

It doesn't just need ease of use, it needs to be better. It needs to be easier to use than credit/debit cards.
I just don't see it happening, tbh. My debit card now has an [RFID chip]( in it so when I want to pay for something I just tap it against the till and it's done in about a second. It's limited to £20 and under, but that's a lot of qualifying purchases. Probably 75% of my purchases in a month are under £20. 
And when I need to spend more I can just put my card in, put my pin number in and bam. Done. It's maybe 10 seconds at the most. 
Also, I don't have to worry about keeping my credit/debit card charged up and I don't have to worry about it needing a 3G connection. 
I just don't see what bitcoin adds when it comes to 'in person' transactions.

@_date: 2013-11-13 13:49:02
Why are you loaning out bitcoins? Are you mentally retarded? 
From a borrowers point of view, borrowing bitcoin makes no sense. No one in their right mind would do it because the value is going up and they're deflationary. 
You borrow 10BTC which lets pretend amounts to $1,000 worth. You agree to pay back the loan + 10% APR. So 11BTC in a year. 
The value of 1BTC rises from $100 to $150. 
You now $1650, or 11BTC. 
That's an APR of 65%. 
Your average bank loan at the moment is around 8-10%. Under if you own a home. 
Loans are so completely retarded in BTC that the only people attempting it at people who have no intention of ever paying it back. 
Economics 101. You shouldn't borrow a currency that is currently deflating compared to the currency you earn in.

It's not just adding a button though, is it? If a serious business with a brand and a decent turnover wants to integrate they're not just going to want a shitty button that takes them to the coinbase site. They're going to want proper API integration with the rest of their site.. You can't have your website forwarding to another website. It's ugly, users hate it and it can often end in abandoned carts. Abandoned carts are lost sales.
I'm not talking about setting up from scratch either. You need development hours and QA testing hours if you want to properly integrate a payment processor like that. 
Like I said, for a shitty one page geocities website that sells custom painted thimbles with a turnover of $2,000 a year and only one product the button integration would be fine. For a company with a decent brand, website and turnover they're going to want the full works when it comes to integration and then they're also going to want to be able to be relatively certain that the investment into all that dev work will pay off in a reasonable time, which I don't think it would. That's what my argument has been all along.

See, I don't buy this. 
Bitcoins are only really worth what you can get for them on the open exchanges. That's the price the public are willing to pay for them. 
If you unload 100,000 and the price drops to $100 then that's all they're really worth. 
So why would someone privately buy 100,000 for anywhere near the $600 exchange price when they can't be quickly liquidated for anywhere near that? 
Where's the incentive?

Bank accounts are free. They make their money by putting your money to work and taking the profit. They give you a marginal % interest, but it's barely worth noting on a current account.

Honestly, bitcoin probably makes the least sense here in the UK from a consumer point of view. We have one of the worlds cheapest and most advanced banking systems. 
Wires are free between UK banks and take minutes, if that. Can be done via online banking in under a minute.
No fees on ATM's
£10 flat fee to wire within the european union. 
We have NFC debit/credit cards now. Paying (Under £20) is as quick as tapping your card on the till. Literally authorizes payment in a second or less. 
We have chip and pin on our cards. Reduces fraud dramatically and makes it harder to clone cards. You need to clone the card and capture the pin number. Obviously not impossible, but one more layer of security. 
Free direct debits and standing orders for automatic payments to companies/individuals. Barely anyone accepts cheques nowadays. 
Also, all consumer bank accounts are free. You'll never be charged for having one open. 
All in all, there's places than need bitcoin more than the UK.

Because almost every member is financially invested in bitcoin. It makes for quite a ridiculous dynamic. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:26:24
**Here is the business argument for accepting bitcoin:**
20 * $100 android tablets = $2,000
~40 hours of staff training (optimistic) = $2,000 (Estimating value of his time at $50p/h)
20 * Decent 'bitcoin accepted here' signage = $200
So $4,200 start up costs, then $30 per month for bitpay. 
**So, now you have to estimate how many bitcoin transactions would need to take place to save $4,200 in transaction fees:**
Lets say he's paying the average rate for card transactions in his sector of about 1% + 15 cents and his average sale is $7. That would mean that the potential saving is 22 cents per transaction. 
It would take 19,090 bitcoin orders for him to see a return on his investment, then he'd need to do 136 transactions a month to cover the cost of bitpays $30 a month fee. 
Even if we up the rate to paypals ridiculous fees of 2.9% and 30 cents (which **he will not be using**. They'll be way less.) then it would take 8,400 orders to get a RoI on the initial costs and 60 transactions a month to pay for the bitpay fees. 
So there's your best and worst case scenario. 
The conclusion is that it's a pretty terrible business decision for him to make as he'll not get that amount of orders in any reasonable time frame. Especially not if you use other subways as case studies. 
He'd see a better RoI by sinking $4,200 into advertising local to his shops. Bus stops, billboards, etc. 
It'd be more useful than using bitcoin to advertise his shops to the bitcoin community that is spread all over the world and will likely never be near one of his shops.

Cash doesn't have chargebacks. Chargebacks are a feature of the payment processors. I don't even understand why you've put chargebacks as a negative. 
At the moment I'm going through a very lengthy argument with a merchant that sent me the wrong item and refuses to give me a refund or pick up the item and give me a refund. I'm going to be doing a chargeback in a few days. 
With bitcoins I'd be shit out of luck. 
It's fair to assume that the same consumer pressures that were put on VISA/Mastercard to create the chargeback system will happen with bitcoin payment processors if they get popular enough.

Not really. That's a flat fee. 
Bitcoin is 0.5% to do the buy order on an exchange, 0.5% to do the sell order on an exchange. 
Maybe other exchange fees depending on which exchange you're using. 
So just under 1% to transfer using bitcoin.. So in practice for anything over £1000 it's cheaper to use SEPA than Bitcoin. 
Or you can do localbitcoins trades, but that is a time sink and they're generally sold at a premium which varies country to country.

Worldwide internet penetration is only ~34%, though. The benefit of bitcoin I see touted most is that it will help poor and developing nations, but these are the nations that are also least likely to have an internet connected populace. For bitcoin to be useful, you'd need a highly connected populace. 
That's generally a sign of affluence, which brings on the next problem. 
When a country reaches the kind of development level where the populace will be mostly (80%+) connected to the internet then it's likely they'd also have got onto the radar of Mastercard/Visa and worldwide banks too. So they'll then start operating in those countries. 
So the point at which a developing country could benefit most from bitcoin is also the point at which bitcoin becomes pointless.

20 weeks of miners running 24/7 for little to no reward. That's a lot of electricity to pay for.. 
Meanwhile trust in bitcoin would fall due to a successful attack on the network. Without trust, price would fall. Particularly as it's a lot less useful when confirmations are taking hours. 
The miners might just decide it's not worth it considering the little reward mixed with the now lower price of BTC. The profitability of running their miners might just not be there any more. 
5 months is a long time to mine for without profit. Lots of faith would be needed that bitcoin would recover after the 2016 blocks were found. 
Not to mention that as people decide to stop mining, it will only take longer for those 2016 blocks to be found. 
If you could control and then shut off 90% of the network in one fell swoop, that'd kill bitcoin.

It's because it's a speculation bubble based on a self imposed bitcoin [filter bubble]( where the only news bitcoin users get about bitcoin is from bitcoin enthusiasts and any criticism is downvoted or just not read. 
At some point people are going to start realising that all these promises aren't being met. 
The truth is, the utility of bitcoin hasn't changed since January and neither should the price if the market was logical and not zealous. 
Another way to look at it. You know how passionately people feel about xbox vs playstation? You know all the fanboi flame wars you see on a daily basis if you frequent gaming forums? 
Well that's the kind of bullshit you get when people have invested just $500 into a game console. They feel the need to justify their purchase, even though it's only slight. 
Now look at and bitcoin forums. These people may be on the line to lose thousands of dollars if bitcoin loses value. How much trust can you put in their opinions to be completely truthful and not self serving?

If the US wanted to get rid of bitcoin (within its boarders) it could just prohibit its use by companies/exchanges. It wouldn't be that difficult. 
Companies would then risk litigation if they accept it. Hand to hand transactions would then be the only way to use bitcoin. It becomes mostly useless and probably worthless soon after.. 
tl;dr if the big bad government in your hypothetical wants your bitcoins gone, it can make them gone.

They're not comparable. It's used as a snarky comeback most of the time and people never give it much more of a second thought. Just upvotes. 
The more I read into bitcoin and bitcoin users, the more I realise it's not about ideology for a lot of people. They'll claim it is, but it's not.
It's about people who are at the bottom of the current system and realise they have a chance to be at the top of the next system.  
They'll claim that the 1percenters are a problem, but really the only problem they have with the 1percenters is that they're not a member.

Pretty easily considering the whole world is reliant on it. It's in literally no ones best interest for the dollar to fail which means it won't. Agreements will be made, policy will be passed. 
The dollar will never fail. 
As a counter argument, how do you stop the bitcoin from failing? Are there any governments on your side? Do you have almost 100% of the worlds population with a vested interest in a functioning bitcoin?
The dollar is too big to fail. The bitcoin is not. It's nowhere close. 
Also, bitcoin is completely at the whim of the government. They could (and probably should) regulate the crap out of it tomorrow to the point where it becomes useless and there'd be nothing you can do about it. 
If you can't exchange bitcoins for real money, the price would soon drop to zero. Even on here people are only concerned about how many dollars they can cash out for. 
It's amusing that on one hand you have people doom and glooming the dollar/euro and then on the other you have them bragging about how many dollars they've made.

Honestly, if I actually had any bitcoins I probably would have sold at $200 but for the same reasons. 
The nearest I ever came to buying in was at $100, but decided against it because I still didn't, and don't, believe the hype when it comes to the supposed benefits of bitcoin. I also feel that a lot of the huge downsides (deflationary by design) are brushed over somewhat.  If I hear 'Oh, you bought a new computer though even though there'll be a better one out next week!' argument one more time I'm going to start crying, I swear.

I've been saying this for ages. Bitcoin is a great marketing opportunity, especially if you're an online business and you offer geeky products. 
If you operate a start up and you want some free publicity on a bunch of forums, and some ideology sales to go along with it then accepting bitcoin is a no brainer. 
You can post your links on the bitcoin forums, rave about how good bitcoin is and they're upvote/comment on your thread like no ones business. They'll literally thank you for spamming them with your site!
That's why I often ask companies that have 'just started accepting paypal' on here how long they've been in business and how many sales they made in the previous quarter. A lot of the time the answer is a few months and 'none'..
People here lap it up though and see it as a sign of good things to come. 
Wordpress and Reddit have both admitted that almost no one pays for their services using bitcoin. I think wordpress sold $400 worth of services over 6 months in bitcoin, and that's a tech company!

Maybe with the archaic system in the US, but not with the more modern UK system. Your card never leaves your hand during a card transaction here in the uk. 
Card slotted into terminal, Pin number entered, card removed. 
Even if the person serving me somehow made a complete copy of my card they'd still need the pin number to use it anywhere. And if they wanted to use it online they'd need my 3-D secure password.

Bank accounts don't cost money each month, though.. They might in your country but not in mine. 


Can and have. Well, it took her 20 minutes to check it had been deposited into her bank account but that was different banks as well. No idea how long it actually took but even if it was 20 minutes that's pretty damn good. 
Bitcoin may be faster in some cases, but it's also more expensive in some cases. Plus you're very limited with what you can buy with bitcoin and until that changes the process for sending money will still be:
Fiat in bank &gt; bitcoin exchange &gt; bitcoin exchange &gt; fiat in bank. 
That's going to take days. Local bitcoins might be faster, but still days.
Plus here in the UK international bank transfers within the EU are free too, although they take a little longer. A few days I think. 
There's nothing stopping the current system from outpacing bitcoin if they ever actually want/need to. Bitcoin isn't much of a player at the moment so there's no need for them to worry. If it ever really starts to gain traction beyond a hobby they'll just redesign SWIFT to be instant and cheaper.

No, it's the equivalent of a penny stock at the moment in terms of trading. An investment that fluctuates by 20% +/- in a single day can not be considered a good investment by anyone with even rudimentary understanding of investing. 
Might it pan out? Yeah, maybe. But it's nothing like the sure thing you're making it out to be. 
I also don't think it can be considered anywhere near as much of a game changer as the Internet and I think comparisons are completely unworthy. 
Almost every 'feature' of bitcoin could be copied tomorrow by visa if there was enough incentive. Hell, they could bring out their own cryptocurrency if they felt the market needed and/or wanted it. 
It will have its niche uses in grey/black market transactions. Might get some fringe use in countries where the big players refuse to operate. 
It's not going to change the world. And it's certainly not going to have the impact the internet did 20 years ago. 
Sorry. I know it's not really what people on here want to hear. The fundamentals just aren't sound enough, the advantages aren't clear enough and adoption is too slow.

The thing is, chargebacks might be something merchants hate but it's something customers love. That's why they exist in the first place, because that's why customers want. They want a way to hold merchants accountable. 
I don't understand why people on here think that people are going to willingly switch from credit/debit cards which allow charge backs to bitcoin which doesn't. Why would you voluntarily give up that option because a merchant asks you to? That's surely a great big red flag. 
It's like when an ebay seller of a suspiciously low price item asks you to use Western Union instead of paypal. Why would I? How would I benefit from giving up my chargeback feature? 
Bitpay or coinbase really need to allow chargebacks or escrow if they ever want their payment gateway to go anywhere.

That's incorrect. The population with access to the internet is around 2.4bn. Of which 0.27bn are North Americans. 
So that's a market of 2.4bn going down to 2.13bn. That's a much bigger percentage decrease than you proposed. 
Plus you need to take into account other countries following Americas lead. 
But it all comes back to utility. Where's the utility for most of the worlds population? China, I can understand. Anonymity is important given their very controlling government. I get that. 
But then Europe? I don't see much utility there. SEPA/BACS make transferring money easy and free between countries, so bitcoin doesn't offer anything there. It's actually worse due to bitcoin transaction fees, even if they are negligible. Negligible is more than zero. 
Some might point to Cyprus, but really there's already existing wealth storage products that can protect you against that style of 'bail-in' as they're calling it. Gold, for one. 
The USA, well most of the perceived utility comes from what I said above with China. I say perceived because Americans tend to fear their government like no other, even if that fear is largely unwarranted. Still, even that fear is a fringe attitude. Most people don't give a fuck as shown with the whole Snowden thing. So I can't see people adopting bitcoin en mass in the US, or at least not on privacy grounds. 
Then we have the rest of the world. Africa is pretty much a non starter for a while yet since its internet infrastructure is pretty primitive as is. If they could somehow market it for phones and use SMS to make transactions then it could work since tons of africans have phones and it's only increasing each year. Still, Africa is a cash economy for the most part. Using your mobile to pay for something face to face will most likely seem redundant to the majority of africans. Just pay with cash. 
I just don't see it. And all that is why.

Fair one. You seem to have had some really bad experiences. 
I use paypal whenever possible just because it's so convenient. I hate having to type out my card number and such.
That said, I'm not really scared of security when it comes to my card. My bank uses 3-D secure which seems to me to negate a lot of security issues online. 
To authorize a purchase online with my card I have to enter my card number, start date, end date, security code on the back. Then I'm sent to my banks website where I have to put in 3 letters/numbers from the password I set with my bank. 1st, 8th, 9th for example. 
Even if someone online stole my card number and stuff, they'd need my bank account password which isn't stored on anyone but my banks server.

My argument still holds weight because it proves it can be done, they just don't want to yet. There's either not enough financial incentive to do it, or it's more risk than it's worth. It can be done for free and quickly because currently in the UK you can do it for free and quickly between 30 odd countries. There's really not much stopping this from being expanded if needed. Maybe some regulatory problems, but nothing that can't be overcome with time. 


Well now you're ignoring what I said. You can't compare bitcoin to the entire banking sector. They're completely different. You think people would be loaning out bitcoins anonymously over the internet? Hell no. They'd need brick and mortar places to sign contracts, have interviews and discuss needs and amounts that can be lent. 
Like I said, it's more accurate to compare something like SWIFT to Bitcoin. They're both ways of transferring wealth over the internet. 
SWIFT operate 3 datacenters apparently. It's hard to find out how much power they require, but they send 15m messages a day. I believe that translates to 15m transfers.  I'm going to hazard a guess that that's more than bitcoin's doing by a fair bit. 
Edit: Apparently bitcoin is at around 61,000 per day. Fair to say it's a lot less efficient. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 17:43:08


I never said it would. Cash doesn't support chargebacks, the processors/banks do. Bitcoin processors will likely have to do the same, or one will and all consumers will flock to it for the added security which will then force all the others to offer the feature.

It's absolutely seamless in paypal. Not used worldpay, but I'm certain it does the exchange rate automatically as well. I imagine they skim a bit off the top, but that's hardly a deal breaker. 
I basically pay for everything online using paypal when I can. Click pay button, type in password, one more click and the stuff is on its way. Easily the most user friendly payment processor around, it just sucks for businesses because it sides with the consumer a lot. 
I'm a consumer though, so that's a plus. I don't really care about the problems that businesses have with paypal. That's their problem. 
They offer it, I'll use it. They don't offer it, I'll probably just look somewhere else tbh.

Charge for the account in bitcoins rather than dollars. 0.005 BTC per month, per bitcoin. 
Agree with an insurance issuer the dollar price for insuring $1000 when stored in bitcoin. Lets say it comes out at $5 for one month of insurance (seems high to me!) for $1000 then a 0.005btc charge would scale fine.
If they rise to $2000 per btc then you'd be paying 0.005btc still which would come out at $10 which is the agreed price of insuring 2 x $1000 worth of BTC. 
Therefore when the price of bitcoin goes up, the price of insurance goes up with it. When it goes down, so does the price of insurance.

You're one of the very few people on here that 'gets' it. 
Your average consumer is never going to downgrade to a system of payment that offers less protection. Neither cash, nor bitcoins offer protection natively but payment processors stepped up in the case of cash and offered consumer protection. 
Someone needs to step up and do the same for bitcoin or no one will want to use it. There's just no incentive for your average joe. Even with protection I don't really see there being as much incentive as people make out. Incentive for merchants, sure. But they basically don't matter. They have to use whatever the consumers use or they'll be the ones losing out on sales and profit.

I'll buy in at $30-40 if it gets there. I'm not interested at 3 figure prices at all.. The fundamentals aren't there to warrant that kind of price.

So you agree a loan of 2000btc with 5% interest yearly and in this hypothetical there's also 5% deflation. 
So at the end of the year your house is worth (assuming a stagnant housing market) 1900btc, and you owe the bank 2100btc..
Loans can't work in BTC, can they? They can't work in any deflationary currency.

You think people will be thrilled when their wallet.dat is stolen? I submissions time and time again here on of people being phished for their online wallet details. You think this is something the average consumer will tolerate? Fuck no. 
The exact same type of system will need to exist in a bitcoin future. Not everyone is an IT expert and can secure their computer perfectly. 
Also, what you said about banks not wanting to change their system is wrong. 
Never heard of 3D secure which visa uses? 
You put in your card number, security code (back of card, 3 digits), name, Address, expiry date. Then you submit it to the e-commerce site. Then you're taken to page where you have to authorize it by putting in 3 random letters of your online banking password. 
That's clearly a change to the system. 
They also allow one time passwords sent to your phone, IIRC.

Competitive how, exactly? You can't very well just build a new road next to the existing one. Roads and rail are natural monopolies where the start up costs are just too high for private industry to be interested. The government can take the financial hit with no chance of profitability because they realise the social benefits that come from having a highly mobile population. 
Having a highly mobile population helps stimulate the economies of different areas and allows for more tax earnings for the government, be it VAT, Income tax or whatever. The end result is money in the kitty, even if it doesn't show up on the rail/road books as profit. 
Private corporations wouldn't be able to do this. They could only take profits directly via the roads/rail they built.

Brit here. I just got my first credit card this weekend. 
Instantly set up a direct debit to pay off the entire balance at the end of each month from my current account. 
I'll probably start using it for everything now I've found out just how much buyer protection you get with a credit card. It's quite amazing. 
For example, if you buy something over £100 then the credit card company is jointly responsible with the retailer for the quality of that product. 
If it breaks and the retailer isn't being helpful you can go to the credit card company and they have to sort it out for you. 
Depending on the product this protection can last up to 6 years from when you paid for it.

There is no economic theory that's convinced me that loaning a deflationary currency would work. 
You borrow 1BTC ($1000) and then buy a TV worth 1BTC ($1000) with it. 
The next week 1BTC = $1100. 
You're now on the line for $1100.
Then when you take into account that any lender would need to tack on an interest rate to make it worth their time and it's a compounding problem where the chances of the borrower actually being able to pay the debt decreases dramatically. So then there's more risk. So you up the interest rate and the problem is compounded once again. 
It doesn't work.

You borrow 1BTC when they're worth $100 each. You want to borrow for 10 years. Assume BTC deflation is 5% per year. By the end of those 10 years you'd need to pay back 1 BTC, or $164..
The thing is, the lender gets nothing from that. They had 1BTC, they surrendered it to you for 10 years. They got back 1BTC. All risk, no gain. 
So lets say they need a 5% interest on top to make it worth it. 
So after 10 years, you owe 1.64 BTC or $268.96.
There's another problem. Assuming no pay rise, if you were earning 1BTC ($100) per month in year one, by year 10 you'd be earning 0.6BTC ($100) per month..
See the problems that come from deflation? 
Completely ignore the $ amounts, btw. They're just a reference of value. You can replace the dollar signs with 'cheeseburgers' if you want.

I'm a moderate pessimist. I get downvoted into oblivion. We're not wanted here and unless you're constantly singing the praise of bitcoin, you're not wanted here. 
Everyone just wants to hear 'To the moon!'..
I don't think bitcoin will ever go back to zero, but I think it's more likely to get to zero than it is to get to $10,000. 
There's not enough utility for bitcoin and I don't see that changing. It solves a problem that the vast majority of people don't give a flying fuck about. Ask the average guy in the street about quantitative easing, inflation, what fiat is.. They're not going to know or give a fuck about any of it even if they should. 
As a currency it's also a complete failure. Even now we see that there's really very little spending going on in the bitcoin community. Everyone is thinking 'To the moon!' so they're reluctant to spend it on anything other than cashing out to fiat. Reddit is spending more facilitating bitcoin than it makes back from bitcoin. Wordpress took in $400 of bitcoin orders in over 6 months and that's a techy company. 
This is the problem with a deflationary currency. It just doesn't work and nothing so far has convinced me it will. Bitcoins current killer apps are gambling and Silk road (clones).
They're years old. 
It's my opinion that bitcoins price is based on speculation that will never come to fruition. It will remain a niche hobby for a fair amount of people but it's never going to become the currency people here want it to become. It'll remain a nerdy gold substitute.

But I often see people on here saying "&lt;large company&gt; are idiots for resisting bitcoin when they could save so much money!" or variation thereof.

It's not that it doesn't have any real world utility, it's just that all its real world utility is shared by existing technology like debit cards, credit cards and cash. 
When it comes to face to face transactions there's really very little point in using bitcoin. I've never seen a very compelling argument for using bitcoin rather than the aforementioned technologies when it comes to face to face transactions.

The thing is, there's really no reason for fiat to be as difficult to transfer as it is. Here in the UK I transfer money between accounts and it's usually there instantly or within an hour. That's different banks, too. It can be done.. There's nothing inherently slow about transferring fiat. The best thing that bitcoin could do is force banks to make worldwide transfers free and fast. I'd say bitcoin was a success if it managed that.

I keep trying to make this argument to at least try and make the zealous members on here understand. 
I don't see bitcoin **ever** being easier to use than paypal. It seems like a completely needless step when paying for stuff. 
Flow of a current paypal payment when linked with debit card like most people do:
$5 in bank account &gt; $5 to paypal &gt; $5 to merchant. 
Flow of a bitcoin transaction:
$5 in bank account &gt; $5 to someone who owns $5 worth of bitcoin &gt; $5 of bitcoin to bitcoin account &gt; $5 of bitcoin to merchant. 
Also, then the merchant has to do the reverse of that. Whereas with paypal all is done once the $5 is in their account. That's the end of the line. 
It's the same reason people don't use gold as a currency. It's finicky. 
It just seems needlessly complicated for no gain over traditional ways to transfer money. Everyone but the smallest e-commerce sellers will get damn good rates on their transactions. Often around 1%.

I hope you don't take too much offense here, but it's basically of no consequence that you accept bitcoins.

I don't think the list of vendors matches the current inflated exchange rate. 
Until big players like Amazon, ebay, etc start directly accepting bitcoins I don't see a bright future for it. The current price is what I'd expect to see if at least one of those 2 companies I named had adopted it. 
But we don't. We have a bunch of small companies and coffee shops that accept it and that somehow valued bitcoin at over a billion dollars.

Surely we can get minimum/maximum carbon footprint. We presumably know the most efficient and inefficient mining rigs in operation.

And this is why bitcoin will not ever take off. The current majority of users just see it as a get rich quick scheme.. No one is spending it in any serious quantity or with any frequency.. 
I bet if most people were honest they could count the amount of bitcoin purchases (Not buying bitcoin or fiat) they made in the last few months on one hand. 
It's one big pump and dump. 
Everyone's saying how amazing it is, how much you can buy with it, how useful services are but then really they're just hoarding it and hoping to become millionaires. 
The bubble never truly popped. The price never probably corrected down to a realistic amount. 
Am I bitter I didn't get in on this bubble a year ago? You're damn fucking right I am. But I'm not going to pretend I'm calling it a bubble because I'm bitter. I'm calling it a bubble because that's what it is. 
Bitcoin just isn't that useful. It's certainly not $90 useful.

It's really quite simple. Bitcoiners hope to be at the top of the next system, because a large majority of them are at the bottom of the current system. 
Ideology be damned, that's the main reason it's hyped so much. 
It's nerd gold. 
As a currency it's completely ridiculous. 
1) Can't loan it since no one in their right mind would borrow in a deflationary currency
2) Can't borrow it because it's a quick way to bankruptcy. 
3) The deflationary design means it will encourage hoarding even more so than inflationary currencies already do. 
It's a junk currency. 
Why won't anyone admit it's nerd gold? That's not even a bad thing, imo. It doesn't need to be a currency. It doesn't work particularly well as one in any kind of large scale. It's better suited to being a digital gold that can be transferred easily over the internet.

I feel like the majority of people on this subreddit don't really deal with this kind of stuff and just buy into the hype about how much credit card fees are for merchants. 
Max it's going to be is 5%. That's worst case scenario, small business, low sales, sub $10 item prices, selling online. 
As soon as you start actually shifting in volume these fees come right down. 1-2%, generally. 
The current average charge for card processing in the UK for retailers is 0.9%. 
Depending on the size/type of retailer it can be anywhere from 0.1% up to 2.5% per transaction. 
This is why Amazon, Asda, Walmart, etc have no intention of accepting bitcoin. 
1) Bitpay/coinbase could never handle their volume
2) The savings would be near nonexistent and on average it would be more expensive.
3) No one fucking uses bitcoin.

Every airport I've ever been to has a little booth where a guy sits. You go up to him with your native currency and you can exchange it for the local currency. Usually there's a bit of a mark up so they make a profit. 
How is adding BTC into the process desirable at all? I mean look at the swing today in value. High 114, low 79... By the end of your flight you could have bitcoins worth half of what they were when the flight started. 
That's much worse than the 5% fees the current system charges.

In the UK the only fees I ever see are:
* **Optional £10 a month for gold account.** Gives me free breakdown cover, free phone insurance (Best phone insurance ever. Got a new phone in UNDER 24 hours every time I've claimed), 1% more on savings account, free travel insurance and a load of other shit I don't use. 
* **Overdraft fees.** My bank charges a percentage, some charge £1 a day. You want to go with the percentage, generally. It's barely anything per month since I only have a £500 overdraft and only use it up in the last half of the month. 
* **Unarranged overdraft fees.** Basically if you go over your arranged overdraft they charge you for it. Quite a lot, sometimes. Just don't do that. One time my bank phoned me up because they saw I had maxed out my overdraft and had a payment coming up. I transferred some money. Fee avoided. 
That's about it. ATM's are free, Wires within the UK are free and almost instant. Online and phone banking is free. Paying by card in shops is free unless the shop is shit and passes on their charge to the customer directly which is rarer and rarer these days. RFID payments are free. 
There's nothing stopping the banking system in North America from being cheaper. Just lack of competition. There's generally 3-4 different banks on any one shopping street here in the UK.

Yeah, the trick is to shop around and look carefully at each bank. Some are worse than others. 
I'm pretty certain Halifax is the worst bank when it comes to overdrafts. 
£1 per day that you're in your arranged overdraft, £5 per day if you're in an unarranged overdraft. 
Absurd. 
You want to find a bank that charges a flat % fee for your overdraft. 
Also, with my bank (I'm going to stop mentioning them as I sound like a shill!) the bank manager of my local branch called me up on a saturday after closing and told me that I had a direct debit due to go out the next day but not enough money in my account to cover it and I'd be charged if I didn't transfer some funds over to my current account.

It was a bubble. Bubbles don't last forever. They pop. It popped. The inevitable happened, the catalyst doesn't matter. 
Plus you can't blame Gox. It was the bitcoin community that decided to do all their business through Gox rather than diversify. If an exchange going down can wipe 50% of the value off your currency then that's a flaw in the currency. A flaw that's hopefully been corrected now with diversification.

Miner makes a bitcoin via mining. 
He puts in a sell order for $1000 per BTC when everyone else is selling for $800. 
He then puts in a buy order for $1000 per BTC.
He spent $1000 and got $1000 back, but increased the average slightly. (Minus fees)

Instead of:


In 1991 [the soviets held a referendum]( and the majority of the Soviet Union wanted to stay in the union. 73% of Russians wanted to stay in the union. 
Also Gorbachev was embarking on a huge amount of governmental reform whereby he was democratizing the union and Russia. Unfortunately he did very little when it came to the command economy and as a result the union collapsed. 
The collapse of the Soviet Union was economy driven, not ideology driven. At the point of the collapse the Russian population would have felt more free than they ever had.

@_date: 2013-10-28 13:52:44
Generally, do people on really care about the political and economic implications of bitcoin? Or is it just how many dollars one is worth and how rich in fiat you're going to get?
It's impossible not to notice the fact that as soon as there's an upward shift in price everyone on here starts shouting 'to the moon' and such. Just looking at the 'to the moon' guys karma shows how many people care about the price in fiat of bitcoin. 
Plus, isn't one of the problems with the current system that a very small number of people control a huge proportion of the wealth. That was at least the complaint of the 99%ers, and I think it was a valid one. 
How does bitcoin solve this? For example, if a bitcoin gets to $1,000,000 then you're going to have people like Pirate with a bitcoin hoard worth $600,000,000,000.. 
How is that more fair? It doesn't seem more fair to me. It seems like most bitcoiners only gripe with the current system is that they're at the bottom of it. They see Bitcoin as a chance to become the 1% of the new system. 
So my question is, does bitcoin actually solve jack? Or is it just going to replace one ruling class with another?

This makes zero sense. Just by holding onto the bitcoins the lender would have made 10x their money. They lost out by lending.. 
In a deflationary currency there's no way to lend which doesn't completely fuck either party.

If you make it good for the borrower, then the lender loses out and would have been better off just holding their bitcoins.

At least with the current system inflation helps chip away at hoarders. They have to do something worth while to keep their money growing. 
With a deflationary currency you become richer just by keeping it sitting there.

Well at least for paypal they're almost certainly on their lowest band. Probably a custom one that's even lower if they're competent. 
The lowest published band is 1.4% so it's no unreasonable to think they could be at around 0.99% anyway with a bit of haggling. 
Paypal are also one of the more expensive options. They also use another payment processor but I can't find details. 
Either way, bitcoin doesn't make sense for them. They could probably count the number of bitcoin orders they'd get per day on one hand. Effort to reward is low. 
0.99% is unseen for small low volume retailers. Not big retailers like thinkgeek who ship volume. Also it threatens confusion during the checkout progress which could lead to lost orders.

Isn't bitpay the cheapest and most reliable way to go from bitcoin &gt; fiat? 
I find it likely that a lot of bitcoin holders just use bitpay accounts to cash out. I think if bitpay released their list of merchants the amount of fake fronts would be obvious. 
I mean, look at their featured merchants...
Wordpress did something like 80 orders using bitpay, and they've recently stopped accepting bitcoin.

It polarizes opinion because when you have one group of people who are really zealous about something, a contrasting group will generally form just because of the pure annoyance of the first group.

It's incorrectly stated as a good thing. It's the same as fiat, really. Fiat doesn't natively have the ability to do a chargeback. That's a feature that banks and payment processors offer to consumers. 
If bitcoin wants to compete with fiat (I don't think it can) then bitcoin payment processors will need to at least offer the functionality that fiat payment processors already have, otherwise what's going to convince consumers to use it?

The bitcoin is just a currency like the dollar is. The dollar doesn't have fraud protection built in and neither does bitcoin.

They have a system in place, they obviously feel it's unlikely to increase sales dramatically.
I imagine they've calculated that the RoI of implementing bitcoins is just not worth it. 
Other things to take into account are refund policies. Do you refund in a dollar amount, or in the bitcoin amount? What if bitcoin price went up/down during the time between payment and the refund. 
Then there's staff training, software implementation, etc, etc. 
I honestly don't think there's much incentive for a huge site like thinkgeek to adopt bitcoin. It's really not going to increase their sales by much, if at all. 
Not worth the ball ache. Especially when the target market of bitcoin and thinkgeek are the same. They're not gaining access to a market they didn't already have access to.

It depends if the business owner would keep all the bitcoins as bitcoins, or cash out immediately to $$$. 
If the latter, there's no business argument that can be made. 
If the former, well then you're just speculating on bitcoins and you might as well just spend that $4,200 on bitcoins. 
The business owner won't gain anything from being an early adopter. It's not like investing in facebook when it started. 
Using your comparison, the subway owner would be more like a user making the switch from myspace to facebook rather than someone investing in facebook. 
What did they get from that? Not much. Certainly nothing that can't be had by jumping aboard if/when bitcoin becomes mainstream. 
Basically, why would he take the risk when he doesn't need to? He can jump on when it's established technology and get the same benefits.
I'm of the opinion that face to face payments don't need bitcoin and that the current technology is more that adequate, and in some cases (privacy, speed, ease of use) much better.

Yes. The point is that it can and is being done, it's just that in some countries it's not done. There's literally nothing stopping the current system from facilitating completely free transfers if needs be, it's just that they don't feel the need and they can make more money by charging. 
If bitcoin ever became a real threat, they could easily adapt to allow such features. An update to SWIFT, or a new protocol all together.

My only reference point is the UK and we don't have ATM fees. I didn't realise this wasn't the same everywhere. 
That's an interesting article. Anyway, I currently use my country as the example of a banking system that can exist and function (because it does)..
* Free bank accounts.
* Free bank transfers between accounts in the UK. About an hour to get into other persons account. Doesn't have to be same bank. 
* £10 to transfer money between european banks.
* £30 to transfer money to any account in the world as long as the country has an electronic banking system
* 97% of ATM's are free to use. 
* Chip and pin terminals in all shops. Just put your card in and input your pin. 
* Migrating to wireless payments where you just put your RFID enabled card near the card reader and you can make payments of £25 or under quickly.
This is the kind of banking system that can exist.. If your banking system isn't like that it's not because it can't be or the technology isn't there.. It's because consumers aren't demanding it.

Another problem with bitcoin usage in the uk is the fact that we already have a very modern banking system. Much more moden than America, for example. They're still signing credit card recipts and signing cheques. 
Here in the uk we have chip and pin, and we're migrating to RFID payments where you just tap your card on the till. We have direct debits and standing orders to pay fixed and dynamic bills. 
Transfers between bank accounts in the uk are completely free and take just an hour or so in my experience. Even transfers to other eu countries are only £10.

I got that price by using paypals processing fees on a $100 order. 
3.4% + 30 cents. 
10,000 / 3.7 = ~2700
So you'd need 2700 orders @ $100 to save your company the $10,000 it costed to get their web developers to add bitcoin processing. 
Or 270 orders @ $100 if you dispute the $10,000 figure and think $1,000 is more reasonable. 
Either way, I don't think there's a business case for either in most merchants cases and I didn't mention anything about a 2700% markup.

In 2010, worldwide, Amazon processed 151 orders *per second*. That's almost the entire bitcoin amount of orders in one minute on black friday 3 years ago. 
At the time Amazon had a market cap of about $90bn.
That means Bitcoin is currently valued at 10% of Amazons market cap, yet doing nowhere near as many actual e-commerce transactions. It's doing about 1/3600th of the amount of transactions, yet valued just ~10 times less.

Hell, if you're sending back £400 then it's only 2.5%. 
If you were sending £10,000 then it would be 0.1%. I don't think bitcoin can compete with that kind of percentage when exchanges are all taking a cut.

Pretty sure you could get a deal where each account holder is insured up to $xx,xxx per account. 
You'd just need to talk to a big insurance broker and explain the problem and how you're going to be implementing the solution. 
You'd have to have proof of your security. You'd have to conform to all kinds of security standards for them to even touch you with a 90 foot barge pole. 
A bank somewhere would do it, though. 
For example, I very much doubt that coinbase is operating without insurance. 
In the end, it's really not that hard to keep coins secure. The risks would be minimal. 
90% could probably be in cold storage. Just like banks don't need to have all their customers cash on hand in the bank, neither would a bitcoin bank.

It's like getting a mortgage in a foreign currency when you're paid in your native currency. It's so extremely risky.

My argument is that they're already well known within the bitcoin community. Well known enough that I've seen this thread a few times just on this subreddit. 
Plus they're a high volume eCommerce site. Their conventional payment systems transaction fees are likely to be pretty darn small anyway. 
The only real benefit at the moment is the advertising opportunity that bitcoin represents. You start accepting bitcoin and your company will be posted around the internet for free by zelious bitcoiners. 
I just don't see the incentive, and clearly thinkgeek don't either.

Lending a deflationary currency is an inherently economically flawed concept with prior real world examples of it not working. 
From [here]( people here in the UK took out mortgages in Yen which then rose in value against the £. 
As you can read at that link, it had terrible consequences. 


By February 2009, the loan would have increased to £770,000 (not including interest repayments) due to the Japanese yen rising to 130. In January 2012, the yen had risen to 117 to £1, pushing the loan up to £855,000.
Posting some shitty website that was thrown together doesn't disprove economic fact. Loans can't work in a deflationary currency. They're financial suicide to anyone who takes one on. 
There's a bunch of instances of citizens of countries taking out foreign currency mortgages only to be ruined by it.

Store of wealth I'll give you, but there's really nothing at all stopping banks from offering faster and cheaper (even free) money transfers. 
Here in the UK we have free BACS transfers between bank account in the UK regardless of what bank you're with. 
Because of that we also have free international SEPA transfers to some 30 odd countries in Europe. It's an EU regulation that you can't charge more for EU transfers than you charge for domestic ones. 
So banks can do it for free. They currently *do* do it for free in some places. The only thing stopping them is lack of competition. There's no incentive. 
If bitcoin ever starts gaining traction they could very easily respond with an upgrade to the SWIFT protocol or something similar. It really wouldn't take much in the grand scheme of things.

Well the GDP of the G8 is about 40-50% of the global GDP.. They're also the countries with the highest penetration of the internet which is necessary for bitcoin. 
Also, I live in a G8 country so it would certainly be dead to me and if the G8 aren't using it it's unlikely anyone else will want/bother to use it. If you can't trade it with the biggest economies on earth, then what's the point? 
Also, no countries will ever adopt bitcoin as a national currency because an inflationary currency is essential for the operation of a modern day country. Without being able to inflate your currency at will you basically have no chance of ever paying off your debts. With a deflationary currency the amount of debt you owe will actually go up as time goes on, even if you're paying it down.

I don't believe in anarchistic anything. To believe that such a system would work you have to believe that individuals are inherently good. I believe that in general individuals gravitate towards being inherently bad and that it's only society which whips them into shape. 
Even in that comics example I can see a problem which regulation would solve. Imagine the guy on the left is a haulage firm operator and the guy on the right is a trucker. 
Now imagine that he said 'I want you to drive (work) for 48 hours straight for $15,000'.. 
And the trucker said 'Yes, okay!'
You think that should be allowed? You think the trucker should be able to drive a 10 ton truck at 60mph for 48 hours just because he thinks 'I can probably do that and $15,000 is a lot of money..'
I don't believe people should have such freedoms.

0.54% is what I'm seeing in the graphs, however it looks like e-commerce, mobile merchants and international merchants are pushing that average up quite a bit. 
Walmart and the like don't come under those categories. It seems likely that they're well under 0.54% in that case. It's really a very small part of revenue. Especially considering the advantages of allowing people to buy stuff with money they don't have (credit cards).. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 15:12:36


I don't agree with that premise. You're clearly thinking of this like drugs but I don't think that's an apt parallel to draw. 
Drugs are drugs. There's no legal alternative to smoking weed or shooting up heroin. 
If the government banned bitcoins, made it illegal to possess and process them then you'd find it damn near impossible to get your money back out into fiat that you could use in walmart or for rent. 
Why go to all that effort of risking arrest, fines, etc when there's a perfectly legal medium of wealth transfer available to you in the form of fiat? 
I don't think the comparison works and I don't think bitcoins would see a rise in price after their utility is decimated.

Existing technology currently solves all those problems without bitcoin. 
1 = Cash. No fees for using cash. Can be got from any ATM. 
2 = Debit cards, credit cards or a bank transfer. 
3 = Debit and credit cards offer the same protection, with the added protection of charge backs. Also as long as you report your card stolen as soon as you find out you'll be covered for any spending by the thief. 
4 = Debit cards, credit cards and bank transfers.

It solves the inflation problem, if you believe inflation is actually a problem. 
It however brings about a huge economy crashing problem. You can't lend out a deflationary currency, or rather you can try but no one in their right mind would take you up on the offer. 
We saw exactly what happens when lending stops during the financial crisis. Shit hits the fan completely, businesses struggle with cash flow, people struggle to purchase a place to live, etc, etc. It's havoc. 
The small perceived benefit of stopping inflation is completely dwarfed by the negative of not being able to issue loans in it.

Because it's quick and easy. 


Some do, some don't. Asda and the likes will be paying pennies per transaction because they have volume. Any big stores will have similar deals in place, so for most of my purchases it's really pretty unlikely that reduced transaction fees would be a significant saving at all. 
With bitcoin I still have to pay exchange fees to actually buy bitcoin in the first place. Then the merchant will also have to pay fees via bitpay or whatever payment gateway they use..


Kinda, yeah. It's never been a problem and all my bills are paid on time and in full with zero interference. All I do it log onto my online bank every now and then and check that the direct debits are going out in amounts I expect. They always do. 
If you're paranoid you can always do a standing order instead most of the time. 


Yes. Regardless, currently bitcoin is more expensive for large transfers.
0.6% fees for both sender and receiver via mt gox. 1.2% equivalent. 
You could do zero fees via local bitcoin but they always sell at a premium anyway so it's pointless. 


I have read up on it enough, I just haven't drunk the kool aid yet. I'm a skeptic and I'm putting my money where my mouth is by not buying in.

That's even worse. 
So the borrower buys, for example, a house. 
The house is worth 2000btc when it's purchased, then a year later after 5% deflation the house is worth 1900btc. 
But the interest rate is 10%, so now the borrower owes 2200btc for their house worth 1900btc. 
The borrower gets completely fucked. Especially as wages would have to deflate as well. So they might have been earning 1btc a month when they bought the house, but by end of year one they're earning 0.95btc per month due to deflation.

What country? I'm from the UK. 
It literally took me 15 minutes to set up my sisters. Email, username, address, card details. Sorted. 
That's all you need to start sending payments. 
I got my account verified about 3 months ago when I hit my yearly spend limit for the first time. I'd had the account probably 3 years prior to that without verifying. 
Took me 20 minutes and some logging into my bank account, but I was verified in under 30 minutes I'd say.

$6000 / 40 = $150. 
Where are bitcoins $150? 
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:35:20
I'm just wondering if there's been any decent study into how much of a real world influence bitcoin has. 
I looked up a list of websites/businesses that accept bitcoin and from what I can tell we're at about 400 or so. Some of them like the car dealerships are really just ventures into advertising. Granted, Bitcoins are accepted there but the likelihood of a person actually using bitcoins at that particular car dealership is next to zero. 
That's the problem I have. I don't feel like bitcoin is really being used to buy anything in any serious quantity.
The list of websites that accept bitcoin is laden with domains that just have 'bit' on the front of them, then a product. Bitvapes, bitcomputers, etc. 
These people are almost certainly just dropshipping stuff. Stuff that's available elsewhere. 
I doubt they're shifting any serious quantities. 
The businesses doing well are the illegal ones. Gambling and drugs. 
Oh, and of course the exchanges. 
I see bitcoin has a $2bn market cap and it just blows my mind. The current usefulness isn't reflected in the price whatsoever, in my opinion. This is pure unbridled speculation and it's being fuelled by the newspapers/news sites using bitcoin as a page filler. 
What happens when they stop writing about it? What happens when bitcoin becomes yesterdays news. A few weeks or a monh of stagnation in the price and then it's not worth writing about any more. Then we could see a huge crash as no new money comes in. 
$30 I could understand. Nearing $200 is ludicrous.

They include assets in calculating that figure. They probably don't even have a hundred million in dollars each. It'll all be in stocks, real estate, etc. 
I was talking about cash. 
If I was to calculate 2% of the worlds total wealth instead then it'd be trillions of dollars. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:12:05


Correct, but it's less of a currency than the dollar. I'd still call it a commodity currently. Not enough places accepting it, not enough people spending it.

This isn't even a little bit true.

Terrible idea. Regulation is a good thing. Look what happened to the banks when we deregulated/underregulated them.

Of course they did. Were you not reading the comments of news articles? 
'Oh that's it now. I don't see us ever going below $1000 now that we've broken that mental barrier.'

Because houses don't increase in value, nor is a mortgage cheaper than renting? 
Both things that are completely untrue in my experience.

Bitcoiners have a completely warped view of investing in general. Best luck to y'all, but you need to adjust your thinking if you don't want a world of pain to come your way. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:09:52


To add to that, because of the hoarding the available supply dwindles. If most people are holding out for $100K coins then the coins available to buy for $500 will be less and less. 
Supply and demand starts to creep in. Low supply, high demand, high price. 
This is why I feel it has features of a ponzi scheme (Downvote mode initiated for 99% of the people reading this). The early investors are promising spectacular things, hoarding, driving up the price so that they can dump at the expense of the late comers. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:42:38

That's not what that expression means. That expression means that when you have money in your pocket, you want to spend it. It's nothing to do with inflation.
I understand your inflation point, but the same will be true in a bitcoin future. Why have 1btc in your offline wallet when you can have 1btc in a banks wallet earning you 5% APR?


Do people on genuinely think that's likely to happen? If someone asked me which I thought was more likely to be around in 10 years, BTC or USD I'd absolutely answer USD. 
BTC has a few internet nerds supporting it. 
USD has 300,000,000 people supporting it, along with 11 aircraft carriers and a million armed men.

I question how many bitcoin users actually give a fuck about the fundamentals and ideology, though. I think a lot of people see it as a get rich quick scheme more than anything, as is shown by the highly upvoted self posts on a weekly basis saying stuff like 'Bitcoin dropped $5 in 20 minutes. What's the explanation?'.. 
They only buy into the ideology because they buy into it being a get rich quick scheme, and with that comes the ideological spiel. 
Not everyone, of course. But many. 
I think from the point of integrating a cryptocurrency into the current financial system and economy an inflationary cryptocurrency would be easier for everyone to swallow.

Well in that case he lost $4,000,000 because the price could go up to $100,000 per btc if everyone adopts it. 
Your argument is dumb and wrong. Repeating it doesn't make it any less so. 
He lost the value of the bitcoins at the time of the theft. He lost $4,000 odd.

No one ever got poor taking a profit. Traditionally in the investment world everyone has a price in mind when they buy, at which they'll sell and realise their profits. 
That's essentially what people are *asking* when they *tell* you to cash out. They're asking you to think about that number.
