Supply and demand are determined by the above psychology, and if seeing that the money can be destroyed lowers people confidence in crypto... boom your demand just dropped.

Voluntary destruction of five euro, vs random destruction of 150000 dollars? Those are comparable to you? Also people and their actions aren’t logical, so don’t apply logic to psychology.

Is investing in multiple cryptos really diversifying though?

Everyone freaking out about everyone freaking out is almost as bad. There’s always a small dip then a huge bump right? Let em freak out and sell, then watch it rocket 3000 bucks. Nbd to me.

Has bitcoin meant significant changes in your country?

Cool. Is this recommended above the idea of a paper wallet? And is a paper wallet literally a UPC code on paper? That part has me a tiny bit confused. Thanks for the helpful info.

Well sure, or I did a bunch of reading before I bought and decided I was making a moderately sized but risky decision, and now I’m fishing to see where to go from here. I understand what you’re saying but I’m looking to get info from as many sources as possible and if I said “should I bitcoin”, all I would have heard was “yes”, except a couple guys saying “no”. Maybe I made a mistake but sitting on a little fence wouldn’t have learned me anything.

I feel like I’m trying to kick it with a group of people who are all old friends and you’re like “man remember Steve” and everyone’s like “yeah Steve, so sad what happened” and I’m just sipping my beer and thinking ‘damnit I wish I knew this Steve guy’.

I do agree with you, I guess, but I’m wondering why you say it with such confidence?

Maybe the point he’s making is regret solves nothing and learning from your mistakes and moving forward is the thing to do

My dad quoted this book to me relentlessly as a kid. It’s why I put so little into cryptos, and so much more in the stock market. It’s why I pack lunch, it’s why I never get soda at restaurants. I make a fine living but I live in the cheapest apartment I can find. Eh sorry to spill, but as bitcoin skyrocket all I heard was lambo and now that it crashes all I hear is I told ya so and lamenting. Mother fuckers need to learn moderation.

I daily write somewhere that it’s going to drop and write somewhere else that it’s gonna go up. I’ve had at least one good prediction every day.

Please explain?
