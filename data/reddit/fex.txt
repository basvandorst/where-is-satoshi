Is it not your fault if Amazon is calling the gift code "invalid". Gyft should do more than say "sorry all sales are final" as they are the ones that sold it to you. I hope this works out for you.

I actually use nmap daily and I understand what your point is. However I take it have you have never heard of ["security through obscurity"]( It is actually a very effective and widely deployed concept if implemented correctly. If you understand how nmap works exactly, it is trivial to throw it off and any other type of fingerprinting scanner.

I agree. I really hope they posted fake hardware info. Believe it or not, simple inforation such as server manufacture, make, model and even RAM limitation is pretty valuable to a hacker, especially if your site contains bitcoin wallets. Revealing the OS is 10x detrimental. Simply put, was that really necessary blockchain?

You can do a wire transfer if your banking site supports it, I know BitFloor supports wire transfers. Or you can use coinbase.com and do a ACH transfer by just verifying you have a valid BoA login credentials. BitMe.com also supports wire transfers.
