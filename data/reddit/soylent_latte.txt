anyone know what the average price would be of all cryto coins?

this might help understanding sha256 but...[sha256 by pencil and paper]( i'd appreciate a similar example for scrypt.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:00:47
thank you. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:13:34
beauty now how does scrypt work?

so long as bitcoin is tied to the usa dollar, but consider going right of the decimal until there are as many bitcoin bits as there are atoms in the universe.
@_date: 2014-10-23 19:47:25
ask for an example of how the current system is helping the world.
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:25:27
my concern is that bitcoin seems to be tied directly to the value of the american dollar. if the u.s. dollar inflates then so will the value of bitcoin. more logical would be to value 1 u.s. dollar to bitcoin. sounds like the same thing but there is a difference.

i think you just stepped into quantum economics.

not quite ALL iphones. it does require os 7. :(

should be a gr8 story to tell the grand kids.

bitcoin is an administrative tool; the value is in the transaction not the currency.
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:25:08
there doesn't seem to be anything to prevent one from making a coin called 'bitcoin'. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 08:58:52
a hundred years from now the blockchain will reveal the entire journey of the coins you spend and buy today. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 04:33:54
right now they come from the found block reward, but if the coins are used up where will the tx fee coins come from? 
@_date: 2014-05-13 11:09:02
if they weren't so scamy i'd recommend a 'lifetime' mining contract.
@_date: 2014-04-16 21:06:06
it's a fun equation.
as difficulty increases, fewer coins, same or more demand, = &gt; value.
as new technology appears the old is sold to waiting noobs.
lower power costs come with newer technology

just one last question for clarity. can a node do transactions for all coins or does each coin require a dedicated node?
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:17:18
nice, ty. what's the incentive for owning a node. are transaction fees distributed to node owners? will the ping function use increase as supply dwindles? i don't have enough satoshies to wipe my but but hey have i got alt coins. thanks again.
@_date: 2014-05-13 10:58:23
how about a few nodes as well? 
@_date: 2014-06-19 06:16:33
both will co-exist without issue. the market will eventually marginalize one or the other. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:17:46
perfect solution. nodes are not paid and are critical to the infrastructure.
while miners are pretty well off the shelf hobbyists raking in good returns for the long term.
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:36:28
understood. but if the 'reserve currency' inflates and takes prices of goods with it then bitcoin will simply be as worthless as the fiat currency only harder to bring into existence.

for clarity, losing the keys is equivalent to forgetting your password or 'losing' the paper you wrote it on.

imho it's downhill until they're all mined. then look out.
