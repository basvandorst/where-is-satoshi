I'm very impressed with your intellectual prowess *clap clap clap*

Good job, man! Don't take any shit from trolls, the community needs more people like you, we have to fight back! Dinner is on me. $50 private

Here's another possible timeline: price keeps dropping daily till the next halving, and by then bitcoin will be seen like even more of an afterthought, and people will chuckle at the mention of the electronic version of beanie babies. Most people already do that, except for the poor saps holding the hot potato.

Too bad it's going to $0, those "cool" people weren't high enough in the pyramid and will have to get a job :(

Ruble YTD: -46%           
Buttcoin YTD: -57%         
Ruble is a crappy currency, buttcoin is just crap (of the virtual, non-existing flavor). Happy holidays, enjoy the losses! :DDDDDDDDD
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:31:44
I'm sure you took advantage of the 70% loss in just one year LOL You must be rich now, you hobo! More to come next year ;)

How could you have known? No one could ever have expected that website to be used for CC fraud! What a surprise!
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:33:49
Are you aware that your shit 402 solution will be used by exactly zero websites? I'd say you wasted your time, but I'm guessing your time is not that valuable to begin with :D
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:35:01
I rather have goat dung. Good fertilizer. Bitcoin is useless virtual shit.

Get used to the idea of operating in black markets... And get used to buttcoin being worth less than $1 :DDDDDDDD

Do you count the tips made by changetip employees? Cause, you know, that advertising budget won't last forever ;)
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:37:28
You should be.

PS. You *had plenty. And then poof, bitcoin happened :D
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:25:14
Maybe... Just maybe... Bitcoin is useless, and its allure as a pump &amp; dump is completely gone? That would explain why the price can only go down from here, like it has been going down for the past 12 months...

OP 
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:22:25
You can't with bitcoin either.
@_date: 2014-12-21 16:41:22
You learned a valuable lesson: stay away from ponzi tokens!          
It could have been worse, most bitcoiners are still paying for that same lesson, and the lesson gets more expensive every day :D
@_date: 2014-11-22 23:55:55
I think from this discussion we can already tell who the real idiot is, you idiot.

Thanks for the link. I endorsed the big lake buoy, seems useful. You're welcome! :D
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:41:50
So... How much have you lost this year with your bitcoin "investment"? hehehehehehehehehe Did you get your family and friends to "invest" too? Can you still show your face in public? Cry more! :DDDDDD         
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:35:27
hehe             
 ...               
@_date: 2014-12-13 00:41:04
Looking at the price it seems all the suckers are already in... It's all downhill from here...
@_date: 2014-12-01 00:30:18
The "product" is a pyramid scheme where people like you are at the bottom, and will always be, no matter how much peddling you do. Sorry. kthxbye

If you tip a hobo $0.003 in real life he's gonna fling some shit your way. Rightfully so.
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:15:55
No, but it affects bitcoin's usefulness, which just went from zero to negative. Also, google SEPA. I paid 1€ to transfer 50k from Spain to Germany yesterday. Only a masochist would use bitcoin in Europe. I know there're a lot of those here, so here's my present for them:              
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:49:04

@_date: 2014-11-23 21:34:28
Exactly, specially when you consider bitcoin and poop are practically the same thing.
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:51:50
lol "teach people bitcoin"        
I doubt you can teach anyone anything. The fact you can even use a computer is impressive :D         
@_date: 2014-12-20 17:08:32
And by people you mean the changetip stooges that go around spamming this crap to try to make it catch on. But that advertising budget won't last forever, and then it's back to $0.00001 tips.

Do you pinky swear you'll pay when you lose?
@_date: 2014-12-16 10:14:50
Also, if you he would have put $7 million into bitcoin a year ago, he would have lost more than $4 million. hehehe
