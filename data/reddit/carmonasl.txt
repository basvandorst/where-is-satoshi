Why on earth would ai tell somebody how to double money instead of doing it myself. I don't really understand how people can be so stupid to believe that bs.

I'm sorry but why you say that I repeat the propaganda. I haven't said anything about eth so I don't understand your accusations. Last thing I will tell you is that before criticizing a book at least you should read a part of it. Thank you anyway I guess.

We explain what projects are about and some technical details as it would be too hard for a new person to understand in depth the technical aspects of blockchain but I want to clarify that it is not true what you said that we encourage people to invest in scams or day trading, we just want people to understand the cryptoenvironment and get some fun (investment recommendations can be considered a crime in our country)

Hello bitusher, we don't encourage anybody to invest in anything, we talk about projects and how trading works but we don't give any recommendations, what scam are you talking about?

In fact we talk a lot about Bitcoin and love it I don't understand  your comment but thank you anyway!

Thank you for your comments bitusher. We don't recommend to day trade in our book nor we have telegram groups or any businesses related to trading, the book is purely informational I'm sure you'd like it :)
