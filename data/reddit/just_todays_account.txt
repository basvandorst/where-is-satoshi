You're wrong.  In my defense, I'll cite a slightly more authoritative source:  [The Chicago Fed](  You can read through the PDF at the link for more details as well as an illustrative balance sheet, although the footnote quote gives the gist.
The tl;dr of it is that yes, Bank X can indeed create money (M1) in the form of checking account credit "out of thin air".
Ninja edit: the footnote I refer to is the "Modern Monetary Mechanics" one.

Keep going to page 9 and 10.


Right.  Bank's assets:   
$10k in FRNs (cash)  
$9k accounts receivable
Bank's liabilities:  
$10k accounts payable (to the Fed)  
$9k depositor accounts
Your example demonstrates *full reserve* banking.  There's no money multiplier happening and there's absolutely NO WAY for there to be a run on the bank (i.e. more depositors demanding cash than the bank has on reserve).
Edit: Only when the customer withdraws the $9k and takes it to another bank, can money multiplication occur.  Bank A now as 10k in assets and liabilities ($1k cash, $9k AR vs. $10k payable to the Fed).  When bank B takes deposits (9k cash) as reserve, it can then lend out, say $8,100 of it and credit it to the borrower's account (in exchange for that promise to pay).  There's still only $10k in M0 (total), but there's $17,100 in deposit accounts (both at bank B).  Where did that additional $7,100 come from if it wasn't "created from thin air"?
Furthermore, from page 3 of my source above (emphasis mine):


@_date: 2012-09-15 04:48:31
Ok.  Sorry I'm late getting back to this conversation.
So we have Bank A, holding $1k cash, loaning $9k to Customer A.  Customer A deposits that at Bank B, who then issues a loan to Customer B.  Bank B has $.9k cash (M0 reserves) and Customer B holds the remaining $8.1k.  There's still only $10k in M0 ($1k + $0.9k + $8.1k).


There's an additional $9k in M1: Customer A's checking account at Bank B (that's the $9k in deposits you've accounted for above).  That can no longer be withdrawn by Customer A without causing a run on Bank B.  Assets and liabilities still net to zero, but the broad money supply (M1) has increased by $9k.
Where did that money come, if it wasn't created by Bank A or B?
In short, [from wikipedia]( "Whenever a bank gives out a loan in a fractional-reserve banking system, a new sum of money is created."

This is wrong.  What actually happens is that Bank X borrows $100 in cash (M0) from the fed.  (As an aside, the fed creates this money by buying debt, such as Treasuries or MBS's.)  When you go take a $1,000 loan from the bank, it creates an entry in your checking account (M1) for $1,000 (the bank's liability), and accepts a promissory note in return (the bank's asset).  It still only has $100 in cash on hand.  As such, you can't actually withdraw the entire $1,000 (in aggregate) but you'll still account for it as cash in your day-to-day life.  This is the "money multiplier" effect.
@_date: 2012-09-14 20:13:57
Not OP here, but I'd like to comment on a couple of your points.


Banks indeed create money (M1 and M2) when they issue debt (such as a home mortgage).  Only the Fed can create the M0 that serves to satisfy a reserve requirement, but they do that by monetizing debt as well.  In their case it's usually Treasury debt (although more recently it's also MBS's).


Indeed it does.  When a bank issues a loan, it creates a liability (credits your checking account) in exchange for an asset (your secured or unsecured promise to repay).  Assets must equal liabilities so when the loan is repaid from my checking account, that money is destroyed.
Default is no different than repayment, except that the bank must foot the bill (that the debtor can longer pay) from the sale of secured assets and/or its other operations.


A debt based society (monetary system, really) is very much as it sounds: all money is debt.  An alternate might be an unbacked, fiat money, or a commodity currency.




These points go hand in hand with the notion that all money is debt.  When P is created (by the central bank or commercial bank), they demand P + I to be repaid.  In aggregate, however, that I *does not exist* until more P is created.  
@_date: 2012-09-15 04:50:15
The bank creates a $1M credit (not cash!!) to my checking account when it issues the loan.  The cash comes from excess reserves iff I choose to withdraw it from my account.
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:29:08
That's a pitiful argument. That $1.5M is likely understating the difficulty.
If anything though, bitcoin is more vulnerable. It would take only ~$1M in BFL ASICs at today's rates to mount a 51% attack. And at the moment, all that hashing power is in the hands of a single entity.

I understand all the hate on ripple, but I'd think of xrp less of a bitcoin currency competitor and more as an ipo in a growth stock with tremendous upside.

+1. Censorship this is not. 
Chances are this just got reported as spam. Given the zeal with which the bitcoin community tends to promote itself, I'd say this is the most likely scenario. 
Perhaps we could consider a moment of reflection to understand why this happened and what (if anything) we can do in the future to prevent it and improve our image. 
At the very least can we please put our pitchforks down?

FWIW, I think this is absolutely accurate as a two sentence explanation for the layperson. I think you're splitting hairs over "past" and "pending" which are close enough in this context. Similarly, mining does further legitimize past transactions by a) including them in the blockchain and b) making the blockchain longer, providing more "confirmations".

Not to look the tip horse in the mouth, but it's a little ironic that you have to tithe the bitcoin bot ~$30 to tip outside the BTC reddits.
If we're looking to spread the word, there's got to be a cheaper way to do it.

Not as much as you'd expect. Assuming 300W times 100 cards is 30KW. Times 24 is 720KWh/day. At $.15/KWh, that's over $100/day. You'd burn through $20k in 6 months.

Fun fact  You can predict tomorrow's weather with 80% accuracy--it'll be just like today's.

Why not? It's not a perfect analogy but it's accurate in a number of ways. The only difference is that gold has 1000x the history as money (although the infrastructure to support bitcoin has only been around for maybe a decade or two). 
That said, I agree with the premise that $100,000/BTC is pretty outrageous.

You'd probably trust banks, much as you do today. If you look at the cash in your wallet (assuming you're American, but my point generalizes) you'll see the words "federal reserve note". You're holding an iou from the fed. 
The difference is, instead of the fed, you could trust anyone from the bank of Bitstamp to your neighbor down the street. Effectively, anyone could become a bank. Their market power is limited to the amount of trust other market participants give. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:37:19
Precisely. I don't know the magnitude of those probability with any precision, but I suspect you'd need &gt;$1M in hardware to have even a 1% probability to double spend a single Litecoin confirmation. (This is WAG. I'm not familiar with the [Skellam distribution]( but $1M would only buy you ~10-15% of the network hashrate.)
If a suitably large pool such as BTCguild (&gt;40% of the current network?) were clandestinely redirected though, a double spend would be significantly more likely.
More likely than a single attacker, IMO is a bug like the 0.7/0.8 BTC bug that caused a weird fork, generating an orphan chain long enough to get some double spends in.
But I agree that for the vast majority of transactions, 1 confirmation is more than enough.

Technically, there is a max where the only blocks accepted are those with a zero hash. Practically, that difficulty is around 2^224, so there's not much worry of actually getting there. 
@_date: 2013-09-23 15:21:56
You *could* call it that, but I think you'd be wrong. If we could determine that this was blocked because of its content, I'd be right behind you. However, there's nothing to suggest it wasn't caught in a spam filter and/or flagged by a number of users who have annoying, proselytizing bitcoin friends.
I'd bet that the block was content agnostic. That scarcely meets the definition of censorship any more than I'm censored because I can't flood your and your friends' inboxes with penis enlargement solicitations. 
Anyway, I say all this because some words have very specific meanings. Regardless of how many caveats you add I think it cheapens the idea of real actual censorship. To call a spam filter a "customer centric, corporate sponsored, private censorship" (or whatever) bastardizes the real censorship that happens in China, Russia, North Korea, and across the Middle East.

In a theoretical sense, the "security" against double spends is directly proportional to the current difficulty (times ~1000 for scrypt mining). As such, a single LTC confirmation is an order of magnitiude easier (or probablistically more likely) to double spend than a single bitcoin confirmation.
If I understand correctly, in order to double spend a single confirmation, you'd need to mine 2 alternate blocks before the network mines the next one (or 3 before the next 2, etc.) as the longer chain is deemed canonical. Without a tremendous amount of computing power, there's no way to do that for either coin, though.
Currently, litecoin is roughly BTCdiff/(LTCdiff*1000) = (10M/500k) = ~20 times easier to counterfeit.

Green addresses are a single point of failure. You need to trust the issuer of the address (e.g. Mt gox in the canonical example) not to attempt a double spend. With ripple, you only need to trust the majority of validators not to collude against you, a significantly weaker requirement.

Are you measuring from the wall? There are significant power losses through the psu. I'm skeptical that you could get 650MH/s at 200W. Mine are closer to 300 before I factor in motherboard/CPU overhead. 
That said, at $.07/KWh, you're at least a year ahead of an ASIC.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but implied volatility is usually calculated with the options prices. It's the sigma that sets the Black-Scholes equation equal to the current price (the other variables are usually well-known).
The actual volatility CAN be calculated. If we take the natural log of an arbitrary hourly observation, say ln($85/$60) we get a sample hourly volatility (here about 35%). Volatility scales with the square root of time, giving an estimate annualized volatility of sqrt(24*365)*ln(85/60).
That's roughly a 3,000% annual volatility for those keeping score at home.

I know nothing of reddits api, but I'd assume it would be orders of magnitude more efficient to track post histories rather than live comment threads. 
Unless there's a technical reason, why not just poll the history of registered tippers (maybe in the thousands?) every ten minutes rather than try to keep up with the hundreds of thousands of daily comments reddit gets? 
Edit: durr I just read through the thread you linked. Looks like I'm not the first one with that idea. That said, perhaps screen scraping would be a possibility? Although  it could be just as kludgey.

The reason for creating xrp is to reduce transaction spam. In order to transact, some fraction of xrp must be destroyed. There's no way to do this with bitcoin or some other currency (it must be built in). A few hundred xrp should be enough to last a lifetime.

ELI5: What's preventing this from happening again in the near future?
It's my understanding that the bug was in 0.7 and only by petitioning miners back from 0.8 was the protocol kept from a hard fork. It's also my understanding that the 0.7 bug hasn't been fixed yet.
What happens now if a block similar to the one that b0rk3d 0.7 gets generated again? Will it simply be rejected by the majority on 0.7 (and ultimately orphaned for those still on 0.8)?
With the ever-increasing BTC transactional volume will this being to happen more often? How long will it be until the majority goes back to mining 0.8? Will there ultimately have to be a hard fork in the not-too-distant-future?
