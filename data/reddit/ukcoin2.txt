it's such a hilarious read, to think the guy will fight in court to try and justify an avalanche of lies and forgeries and still sit there and say it's all true, it's fascinating to see someone who will never ever back down even when every single person in there knows he's a liar and a serial fraudster and forger.

if you want to call being incredibly successfull and making huge amounts of money a blunder go ahead, I wont be agreeing with you.
Also, I was replying to the point saying "greatest blunders in business history". Im fairly certain there are thousands bigger blunders than a company deciding to go from retail to OTC and making huge amounts of money from it, not what I would call greatest blunder in business history.

$1m in btc unless you actually need to use the money. Bitcoin moves from top to bottom and back so fast that unless you need the money within 2-3 years you might as well leave it in Bitcoin. It also depends how long you've been around Bitcoin, if you've seen 2 or 3 bubbles you're like "meh, ill just leave it in btc" and pull up the mr bean rollercoaster gif.
Also, if you've been in Bitcoin a while a lot of people will agree it transforms your way of thinking by turning spenders into savers, Bitcoin is the only thing I've ever owned that feels painful to sell, like you'd rather sell anything else first or go without before selling coins. I think that sort of thing will have happened to a lot of people.

You've almost certainly been scammed by the seller on localethereum. The bank wouldn't send the funds back to the original account unless the original bank had filed an indemnity recovery. So, the seller either used a stolen account or sent the money then claimed he had no idea about it. When it happened to me I was lucky the original bank realised the account was a scammer and froze their account and I got my money back. It's messed up that they send the money back rather than hold it to get both sides of the story. I hate banks but Revolut are simply following the ridiculous laws and regulations, the original bank will have filed an indemnity recovery and Revolut had to give the money back because they're being told they're holding onto stolen money.
One thing for certain though, the remaining balance on the account will not have been sent back and is rightfully yours, Revolut are not allowed by law to steal that money, if you can prove the source of funds they have to give it back to you. They must have a fraud department so if the balance is worth fighting for you need to contact them and demand the return of the remaining balance because you have proof of source of funds. I've had 4 bank accounts blocked or closed and I got every penny of my money back, it took a while but I got it all eventually.

but you dont know that someone scammed the original sender, it could be the person sending from his own account and then claiming he knew nothing about it. What I explained to you is exactly the scenario you are in so you need to read it and listen to me and follow those procedures. You need to speak to your banks fraud department and send them proof of the transaction and then they should make an indemnity recovery claim. You might not get your money back if the other person was legit scammed but what I'm telling you is that when my bank made the indemnity claim to try and get the money bank the other bank said "yes we realise the sender was the scammer, his account is frozen and the funds we took back from you are safe. We will return them back to you" So right now you dont know if the original "innocent party" was actually a scammer or not and for all you know they might have been found out and their account blocked because they might have used their own account and scammed lots of people. You wont know until you engage with your own bank, send the proof of the transaction and then make them file an indemnity recovery to engage with the other bank.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:59:14
don't explain anything, live a simple, basic life, blend in quietly until the day comes to get out. You get very few chances to change your life in an extreme way, if you tell your parents and they stop you doing what you're doing it'll grind with you for the rest of your life. If you need to reduce your activity slightly to become less "suspicious" then do so but do not expose yourself to the chance of messing it all up. Example, buy a couple things off JD/Sports Direct like you said, they wont know how much is cost, spend like 10-20% put rest in Crypto, dont put 100% in then have no way of explaining yourself. Seriously, if they mess this up for you out of ignorance and you realise quickly or years later how gigantic of a mistake it was telling them, you'll regret it for years to come. Most things in life should only be disclosed if you feel there's no choice, openly disclosing things opens yourself up to problems. Do you want everyone around you knowing you've got 2.8k, on a council estate?  I would'nt. Believe me, quiet, anonymous, blend into the background is the best way to go until everything is in place and you can make your move.

don't say anything, keep doing what you're doing until you change your life. Just because your parents are older doesn't mean they're wiser.
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:18:15
Do not expose yourself out of your own fear, it sounds like you expect the worse when nothing has happened. I've been there and done that. Like I said in my other reply if you need to scatter a few things on the ground to make things easier then reduce your activity a little, do things that will ease your worry a little but do not disclose what you do. You also need to realise that at 15 you are still entitled to your own privacy, with everything in life only disclose the minimum that you can to appease a situation. There's a very good chance that the only person that's smart enough to change your life is you, it's important to be prepared, calm and know how to protect yourself from exposure. If your parents ask questions play the dumb kid, say you spend it, say you dunno where the money goes, say your dad doesn't pay you enough (deflecting the questions onto him), 5 euro an hour is nothing, they cannot expect you to be living the high life on your wealth from a weekend job on that wage, to an adult it doesn't even cover basics. 2.8k euro is literally nothing, you need to understand that in your head, it sounds like you feel like it's a significant amount and so it's weighing you down, remove that thought, 2.8k doesn't get you even 1% of the way into life so look at the big picture, relax, blend into your surroundings, be smart and carry on.

it's nothing to do with LBC, it's to do with the banks, all you can do is send your banks fraud department screenshots of the trade, but I'm not sure what will happen if the other account is claiming they had no knowledge of it. This exact thing happened to me but when my bank tried to get my money back again I was lucky because the other persons bank had figured the guy was a scammer (no idea what had happened with it) and I was able to get the money sent back because they had frozen the acc in question. So don't give up hope yet but it does depend if the other account is seen as innocent party or if theyve realised its being used to scam people and if your money is still sitting in their account.
If you speak to your bank or want to research online it's called an indemnity recovery. The scammers bank sent a recovery notice so your bank had to send the money back. Once you contact your bank and send them your proof of the trade and they understand it was legit you need to make them now send an indemnity recovery to the scammers bank and claim the momey back, that's when you're hoping they've closed the guys account and frozen the money so you can get it back, if they still see him as innocent victim then I'm not sure what'll happen, as I said I was very lucky.
The point is you did nothing wrong so if you talk to your banks fraud department, tell them you have proof of the transaction (especially if the details matched and include the chat screenshots). It may take a week and your account will  probably remain closed but they'll have to give you your balance back and you then also have the right to push them to make a recovery claim as you've proven you've done nothing wrong.

There's going to be 20b euros created out of thin air every month for as long as they like.
So, just one year from now they will have created 240 billion euros, that's just scary. Four years from now nearly one trillion euros made out of thin air.

the look on the guys face lol.
I'm amazed a btc exchange managed to survive in Turkey, felt certain banking and government would've shut it down a long time ago

USD, early days there were much bigger btc transactions sent like Mark Karpeles shifting MtGox coins.

this is what makes me laugh, like you say they've been doing it since single digits, instead of being rich they have a reddit sub to circle jerk into.
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:09:57
as expected
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:32:59
if you put a scammy shitcoin that no one uses as the first option on the site people wont take you seriously. It looks like a site that supports Bcash so I wouldn't use it.

a random stranger who happens to have the surname nakamoto mixed with a war criminal, so classy.
You get the award for stupidest btc shirt.

1. mempool was empty so stop lying.
2. Where was it stated he couldn't bump the transaction if he wanted to? Did Roger stipulate that in the bet or did he simply bet it wouldn't confirm? 
lame ass lying Bcash tards all the same.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:48:40
ahahah great joke you did there.

As long as Erdogan stays in power there's a very real possibility of hyperinflation. His answer to the lira problem is simply deplete all other reserves to buy lira, instead of fixing the problem. When the reserves run out it'll be a collapse.

It's nice of him to keep reminding everyone what a cheating, lying pile of scum he is, and on such a public stage too! wtg Ver.

99% of people will still have the same life, only a few will make wealth from Bitcoin. The wealth gap won't close, a few people will simply be able to jump up some levels, same as those who made wealth from the internet, that didn't result in the wealth gap closing.

"The Group of 7 (G7) advanced economies created the FATF to combat money laundering and terrorist financing"
well that worked out well didn't it? Funny how rules and regs get more obscene yet the things they're designed to combat continue to flourish...

ignore the fact the mempool was empty right? dont let facts get the way.
@_date: 2019-05-24 07:43:08
that's not how it works. It's every 230,000 blocks not every 4 years. We are now 3/4 to the next halving.

you clearly haven't seen the weird split personality that has come out of his twitter account.
@_date: 2019-05-25 15:09:28
why do you Bcash tards keep spouting lies?
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:51:03
but you clearly are pushing your personal preferences if you list BCH first, there's no reason for that, it's 4th by marketcap and they're not listed alphabetically so why do you have it listed first? It clearly looks like you're trying to push one of the worst altcoins out there, so it impacts your credibility greatly.
@_date: 2019-05-25 15:08:05
if the mempool was empty it's irrelevant what number it was.

"The miners in this case did choose to drop prohashes block and from what I heard, it is because they deemed a transaction within it to have been invalid,” responded active bitcoin cash supporter Jonathan Silverblood."
so much facepalm
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:11:37
it's ancient news, a t least a couple of years old, not really sure why it's being rehashed now.
@_date: 2019-05-25 15:10:50
well look at the facts and decide for yourself. The mempool was empty and the Bcash tards lie and never accept when they're wrong.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:05:54
Vinny Lingham is a clueless idiot who not only supported Bcash over Bitcoin but keeps spouting nonsense until he's as right as a broken clock.

I wouldn't say that until there's 144*365 blocks left, that's the next target I'm looking at and we're not quite there yet.

exactly, we need somewhere for those people to go, otherwise their disease spreads back out into the community.
