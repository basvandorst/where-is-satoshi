Hi all this is our ATM and would like to clarify a few things. There is only one Canadian exchange that the Robocoin backend worked with: VoS. We were happily trading on that with a much smaller and more reasonable spread. However something broke/changed and RC informed us we can no longer use it after our ATM was down for 4 days while they bumbled through trying to fix the issue. 
So we now have no alternative but to use a USD exchange to run our ATM. This is what causes the large spread for us and we hate it. Not to mention it's an accounting nightmare. 
So to break it down for you:
All our transactions have to be padded by an initial 9% to convert CDN to USD. 
Secondly we also pay an additional 2.5 - 3% premium in fees to banks to convert our funds. 
Thirdly if the market moves against the CDN or we have to pull money back out from our exchange to fund the ATM it will cost an additional 1-3% in fees. Just a small change in CDN / USD exchange rate can wipe out our profit. 
Fourth we pay an additional 1% directly to robocoin
Fifth we pay rent
Sixth we have to make a profit. 
Nobody is forced to use the ATM. It's a convenience and one of the few ways left to anonymously transact in bitcoin. Point us to a reliable CDN based exchange that works with RC and we will happily switch and reduce our risk and fees. None exists at this time. It's very easy to point fingers when you don't understand our business specifically.  Operators in the US have a huge advantage over countries that have to convert their currency.
