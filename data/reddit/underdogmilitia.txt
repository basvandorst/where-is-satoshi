Whenever I see or hear the term "hoarding money" by people who advocate monetary inflation it only seems to apply to working or middle class people.
Apple Inc , big corps and billionaires with billions in cash is not hoarding, right?
Come on, I know people like you can't turn down an opportunity to lecture me about how I dare judge Apple inc sitting on Billions in cash, while telling us all the evils of some working class man keeping more than a few months cash as savings.

It would appear that a LN node requires "always on" connection to other LN nodes to function as a hub.
Now this begs the question, can a "spoke" LN node be used if it is only connected to  a hub to "update" the channel, and will the channel of the spoke still be up if the connection is intermittent. 
Upvoted for discussion.

I don't know, but CJDNS may be a possibility when configure correctly, although in any case an actual LN hub should NOT be located at a personal residence (i. e. hubs should be hosted on dedicated servers).  Nodes at personal residences should be limited to LN "end points" at most.

No you don't (according to your comment history)
I've been lectured for most of my adult life about how poor or working class people are envious or jealous when someone else makes money.
However, it seems to me that the people I see getting offended about a working class man climbing the economic ladder are those with money.
For example now that I have more money than I ever had, it is people who have more than me who seem to be the most offended about it.
It is like a southern plantation owner getting butt hurt about an escaped slave.

Two problems with this ruling.
1. Commodities were only taxed as a gain when selling for dollars.  Now the IRS appears to be claiming taxing jurisdiction over interactions among persons where no dollars (no commerce) is involved.
2.  The Coffee cup analogy:  Most of us would gladly pay a reasonable lvl of taxation, I do like roads that are in decent shape for example.  However, when I buy a cup of coffee, I already pay a sales tax in my local state, and the business pays income tax on the profit from selling me the cup of coffee.  These taxes are already being paid regardless if I use dollars are BTC, now the IRS wants to lay a 20 to 23% capital gains tax rate on top of those other taxes.  To call this double taxation would be an understatement.

My only experience with tax collectors threatening me are at the local and state lvl (PA)
I was charged for failure to file twice and won both times.
I won by filing a simple motion to dismiss because they were beyond the statute of limitations (2 years in PA, and most people do not know this).
I do like BTC for the fact that it is much harder to seize, that is one of the many reasons why the majority of my "liquid assets" are in BTC.
BTW- I say harder to seize, but not impossible, because DPR and others have proven that the slightest slip up in security can put your BTC in danger of being seized.

Best analogy I can think of is cars vs bus (carpool lane) .
Some urban areas have multi lane highways with some lanes for all cars (including single passengers) and carpool only lanes.
In a sense this makes the highway much more efficiency as long as single passenger cars stay out of the carpool lane.
The segwit part of the blocksize increase from this soft-fork is like an added "carpool lane" on the highway.
Luke is simply asking people to keep single passenger cars out of the carpool lane as this makes the highway less efficient.

Bitcoin should pass over 10k within the next 12 months, however, I believe there will be a wild ride before that.
Also sometime when bitcoin is between 10k and 13k there will be an event where bitcoin gets smashed back to between 4k to 6k giving folks another buying opportunity before the next rise.
Although, when bitcoin does get knocked down from over 10k to 5k many of those who were saying they want to "buy the dip" will be too scared to do so.
Those who remember reading this in the future, know this, now is not the time to give into fear.

The Judge rule bitcoin is money specifically in this case because the prosecutor's case requires that judge to recognize bitcoin as money for it to be an element of the "crime" and secure a conviction.
If the prosecutor's case required bitcoin to be rule NOT money, then the judge, or another judge (I predict in a future case), then the ruling would be different.

You are in allegiance with those who are blocking segwit (LN) from bitcoin and then have the balls to come on here and say LN isn't the answer because "nobody uses it"
This is the very definition of gas-lighting deception greater than a Jedi mind trick.
This is very rude of you.

Fair enough.
Here is my upvote sir.

If I was a betting man, I'd say Bitcoin will cross $3000 within 48 hours of segwit activating.
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:01:52
My guess is that John's escape clause will be to claim 500k will still count as the sum of the combined BTC + BCC forks.

next stop $1776 Litecoin

"I think what happened is my exchange resubmitted the transaction after it expired?"
Looks like the problem could be at the exchange. Is there an actual transaction hash you can verify on the blockchain?
Without this, it is possible (has happened before) an exchange can be dishonest with you about transfers.

Recommend to move it before July 31.
For beginners I would recommend electrum wallet :
You memorize a series of words and the bitcoin is stored in your brain (or you can write it down on paper).
Electrum connects with servers that run full nodes, , in the future be sure to connect your electrum client side wallet with the node running the fork you are wanting to transact on.
