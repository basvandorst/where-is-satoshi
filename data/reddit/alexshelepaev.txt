I wonder how they are going to do decentralized management? On blockchain technology? Without ICO it will be difficult to do. We therefore formed their own ICO

Why on the website two identical pictures under different names?

I'm sorry! I wanted to help.

Perhaps they meant BCC? typo out

What's the problem? ICO worldwide are working successfully! In China shut down, but the end is not yet.

Russia is concerned about the problem too. As you consider whether to adjust the operation of the ICO in the world?

ICO is the real theme! A great opportunity to display your project and tell the world about yourself! You like a good ICO projects?

Don't be afraid! Bitcoin gold will sink into oblivion as well as BCC.

According to this principle works only SCAM! The rest of the ICO itself is quite decent, for example Investy or InvestFeed.

Yes! Look at their website. I would attach a screen shot, but I do not know how.

The government of China gradually picks up everything in their hands! ICO is forbidden, and the bitcoin has allowed and legalized.
