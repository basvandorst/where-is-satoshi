Before you take this post word-for-word, please know that it and the movie The Big Short are simplifications on what happened with the great recession. I do not have the info present but I was taught in an intermediate macroeconomics class that regulations were created to prevent something like this from happening again, although they probably are focused on the housing market alone. 
Even though banks were incentivized to make risky loans to people who could not pay off their mortgage, I do not believe the banks acted with the idea "If something goes wrong, we'll just be bailed out and it'll be fine." Lehman Brothers is a perfect example of this, since they were divided up and bought by other banks after declaring bankruptcy.
I clearly do not have all the information, but I want to point out that the Great Recession is not something that can or should be summed up by a short post like this.
All that being said, bitcoin does provide a venue to make reliable transactions without banks. Decentralizing transactions does take out the middle-man of banks, but also takes out the regulator of government. If bitcoin does replace banks hypothetically, the bitcoin community should be open to regulation to prevent another recession from happening. There is pretty clear evidence that bitcoin's price bubbles, so there should to be some type of regulation to minimize the impact of a bubble forming and popping. I understand if this last statement gets ridicule because people love watching bitcoin's price go up, but I'd rather see a price that is a strong identifier of bitcoin's actual worth, especially since it's worth appears to be increasing as well.
