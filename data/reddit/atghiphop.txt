Appreciate the analysis, nice work!

It is a fake 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:09:41
That happens when it lags. Just keep pushing it, reload the page, push it, reload the page. do it until it works. that worked for me
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:11:08
It is fairly common. It lags out like crazy, the price drops because everyone sets orders to market price. Then others get nervous and sell, then once its back to ok the price comes back higher and lots of people regret trading during that time.

haah go for it ^^
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:15:48
hope it works for you

In Japan you dont. I also live in Japan and transferred from my Japanese bank account with no problem. Took about 3 hours.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:50:38
You dont need to be verified to transfer money in and buy. I joined a few days ago and am not verified and I have bought 10 coins already.

My advice is read all you can on it. Its what I did. And yes your best bet will be to buy directly from an exchange. Read on the exchange's site how its best to get money into your account. It is a bit intimidating at first, but you will learn it if its something you feel worth the time to invest in.

I just did exactly that no problem/

haha you go by percentages when it comes to stuff like this
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:16:53
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:41:04
They could?

@_date: 2013-04-10 16:16:59
Thank you! Ya its weird, but its what works
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:50:48
Just watch the ticker sites, they usually show the lag:
or here for lag info only:
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:21:11
you're an idiot
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:52:16
haha true, nothing beats the surprise of a market sell with a 12 minute lag in the market!!
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:42:02
I dont want this anywhere near paypal. I cant wait for the day bitcoin puts that awful company out of business. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 09:00:28
Ya, just follow their directions perfectly and you should be set! But since its Sunday the money will probably be in your account Monday morning around 10 or so
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:14:01
haha one guy trying to fix his order isnt gonna do much worse to it. it does sound weird, but it will get his order canceled. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:07:47
I know exactly what you mean!
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:48:52

My favorite thing about bitcoin is the hope its given me to escape my current financial situation. Its also really fun to watch and stress over the live charts ^^
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:54:13
No it wont say anything until its there, check the address on  for how many confirmations you have so far
but bitfloor is super lagging now. I think everyone is trying to do this
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:56:15
Well I live in Japan where Mt.Gox is located, so I didnt need to become verified to start trading. I transferred directly from my local Japanese bank account to theirs and had my bitcoins with a couple hours. If you are somewhere else you may want to try another exchange if you dont want to wait. Read up on all the info on the sidebar, or check some of the more popular threads for info about other exchanges. 
As for sending Mt.Gox personal info, yes I did send them scans of photo id and proof of address to increase my withdrawal limit.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:40:11
For sure. I bought what I was comfortable with, sold a few coins and got my original money back, the rest is gravy
