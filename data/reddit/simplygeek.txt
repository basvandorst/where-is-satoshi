Bank runs happen because of the scam known as fractional reserve banking. Return to 100% bank deposits (and a gold standard) and that eliminates bank runs. 
Regulation, whether by a 3rd party or by government, is a separate issue.

I invested in some risky stocks and other assets as a quick "buy low sell high" and made some good money. But I don't do it very often and it's nothing to brag about as a consistent get rich strategy. 
It's like the kind of money some people would spend on scratch tickets or going to a casino. It's just for fun and for me it's more fun than blowing it at a casino because there's at least some element of skill involved.

Agreed that it would reduce the rate of growth. On the flip side, the growth we WOULD have would be safe and stable.

Do what I do. Set aside some money each month as your "risky investment" money. This should be disposable income, not your rent money. Of course this depends on your financial situation. I allocate a small percentage of my overall investments into really risky gambles.

Sweet man! What I love about stuff like this is that there's actual skill, planning, and analytics involved. That's all stuff I can enjoy for it's own sake. The money is a bonus. This is exactly the type of stuff I'm referring to.

Earlier this week the market cap for BTC was $1 Billion USD. His amount is a tiny meaningless fraction.
