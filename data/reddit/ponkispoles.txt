Makes me feel for the dogs that keep thinking today is the day, and that day never comes :/

Actually following up on this.  Would we ever know if he deleted his own bitcoins? Was there ever a trace to his wallet to see them moved and etc... Not new just curious.

Thats awesome bro!
Im buying a Harley with a little of my initial investment that i just sold. Never thought it would go this high, and living frugal doesn't leave much for expensive toys. Seems fair I reward myself too. cheers!

thanks m8! I remember seeing this on the front page a long time ago but never followed up on it. Have some catching up to do 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:54:37
I am! 
I was saying who the hell is buying at 100 last Monday. Now I'm buying at every correction.

I learned that bitcoin dips and recovers faster than I can dump money in the exchanges.

This might be an unpopular opinion but I don't think he should ever make himself public. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:38:51
Depends how you look at it, anyone buying into BTC right now is an early adopter in my opinion.

What do i do with this leased Lambo?

I told her she'll regret not accepting a bitcoin today a year from now. 
either way i took a redditors advice and ask to pay in bitcoin in every cash business situation.

Do it. I did the same thing 3 months ago with about the same amount of money.  Whos to say btc wont keep going up.
Never put more than you are willing to lose. If you can stand losing 500 bucks then by all means buy buy buy!

I thought I was late to the party when I bought some last weekend.

The market is always right. Even when its wrong.

Anyone know how much it costs in btc? 
Edit: never mind. It's switched to USD automatically. So 250,000. 
If I listened to my gut a few years ago I could have afforded it. Maybe in a few years from now!

125% increase in 2 years? I'm ok with that
@_date: 2013-10-07 23:46:15
I don't doubt it. I'm willing to bet there are many very interested investors wanting to buy large amounts of BTC. Those coins will sell like hot cakes.
@_date: 2013-04-27 22:16:15
Might be worth .50 cents next week too. Never know

My countrys exchange was hacked during the pop back in April and it was closed for over a month. I would have sold them all at a loss if it wasn't for that.
