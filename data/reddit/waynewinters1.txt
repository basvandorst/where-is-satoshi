Yeah it seems like it's the only reliable way... Do you know a safe and reliable way to get from bitcoin on coinbase to a trader who buys in GBP?

I've searched all options, the only option they're giving me is to deposit euros into my euro wallet, Im British and have GBP... I've read up that id need to make a SEPA transfer which I'm not sure how to do, and I'd have to deposit money to coinbase just to open an account... I love how easy it was for them to accept GBP wire transfer though :)

Thanks IL check it out. Is there a failsafe for both parties? What's stopping either of us from running off with the others money? Surely there would be plenty of scammers if it's simply trusting anonymous strangers?

Wow ���� if it was so dodgy why do they have the option to receive this money then? And how did I fuck up?? Because my country has GBP and not euro? Fuck off you idiot.

It won't let me open a GBP or euro bank account without a SEPA transfer, I have my money in my euro wallet on Coinbase and am trying to get it out as cheaply as I can. Would a sepa transfer to them be the only way now to open an account?

It seemed alot more complicated tbh �� I didn't know where to go with the bitcoin and how to ensure I wouldn't get scammed, it's a decent portion of my wealth so Im pretty cautious incase I made a mistake. Is it a simple process?
