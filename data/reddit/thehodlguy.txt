No.  I don't think I'll give you my bitcoin.  I'll continue to just hodl.
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:49:18
But they don't know what hodl is, so not really much I can add to that subreddit.
@_date: 2018-05-10 03:07:46
Yes.  That you don't know this should probably make you think twice about 'contributing' to this subreddit.  It's 2018 bruh.
Me?  I prefer just to hodl.  I get rid of the $ first.
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:20:34
Video games.  Only by them devaluing over time can you teach them the advantage of hodling.
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:07:59
Been hodling for over four years.  2014/2015 was harder.
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:09:44
The lady knows exactly where the bitcoin is.  We hodl together.
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:24:44
I'm a simple man.  I just hodl.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:50:20


No.  I hodl, not waste time trying to educate the wilfully ignorant.
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:04:16
Why didn't you read the ['getting started']( links in the side bar?  After you get all of your money stolen, which you will if you go to those sites you have chosen, you might want to read those links first next time.   Then you will know how to hodl.
@_date: 2018-05-26 03:46:42
This is how I hodl.
@_date: 2018-05-10 02:43:56
That's how I hodl.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:46:51
Bitcoin has the same averaged 10 minute confirmation times for all blocks since it was created.
You should just hodl until you learn how it works.  If you want instant transactions, use lightning.

Having been a hodler since 2014.  Bitcoin passed 5k for the first time in mid october last year.

My prediction :
2019 : hodl
2020 : hodl
2021 : hodl
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:39:13
I'm a simple man.  I just hodl.
@_date: 2019-12-17 05:51:15
I have one strategy : hodl.
@_date: 2018-03-04 05:28:38
I reckon he really just needs to hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:41:51
You should really just hodl.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:22:05
I think I'll hodl.
@_date: 2018-03-20 08:51:39
Do you hodl?
@_date: 2018-03-19 06:12:54
I hope he hedl.
@_date: 2019-09-02 10:39:55
I hodl until people stop measuring vs dollars.
@_date: 2018-07-29 01:47:08
I agree.  I'll just hodl.  Until such a time as I can spend easily and pervasively directly to people/merchants, without the middle-men.
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:00:23
I just hodl through all of them.
@_date: 2018-07-02 00:30:30
It's for hodling money for when you're ready to spend.  But primarily, it's for hodling.

In 2025 I'll see what my stack is worth and decide what I want to do.  Until then I hodl.
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:33:57
I just hodl.
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:33:00
No-one is forcing you to use segwit or lightning.  It's a soft-fork, unlike the bcash fork.
If you are a hodler of bitcoin, nothing has changed.  You can hodl what you like.  But what you don't get to say is the thing I hodl now is something different, because you want to steal that name.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:00:32
Hodly wodly.
