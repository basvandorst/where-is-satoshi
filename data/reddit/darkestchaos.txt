Fair :) thanks for the honest, understanding, and accepting response- you're better off than most, character-wise, on reddit. Cheers.

He actually bought another two pizzas last year, using BTC. He's a good sport.

Besides the ability to scan your license, it also allows you to scan barcodes. They need access to your cam for this.

Oy vey..! Jeesh

Answer checks out.

^This guy nails it.

Except you no one has to pay for a whole bitcoin- they'll gladly buy pieces at whatever price.

Making a video to remind YouTube folk TODAY. Good post. We should all know better- especially newer crypto users!

Then where do I get my cheese from?

Just bought beer with mine to celebrate the price increase :) Cheers

I'd give you gold, if I could.

Or on the election night, when Trump was about to be declared winner- and stock future crashes, and had to be put on emergency lock down for the night.
Next morning, back up to previous levels...nothing to see here!

Paying through Bitpay is not the same as paying someone in Bitcoin. 
Bitpay is NOT good for Bitcoin... we should encourage peer to peer spending, and not this distraction, to fit regulatory molds.

Just leaving this video about him here:

Welcome back :)

It's not a loss unless you sell. You, long term, shouldn't be thinking about accruing "cash", especially in the short term. The more BTC you have now the more "cash" you'll have on the next run up.

Capital controls are strict. Citizens cant move much money out of the country...realistically, every government should be realizing that Bitcoin is better money than the phony central bank fiat. This is a frightening fact, but some places are clamp down quicker than more populist governments.
@_date: 2019-02-08 01:56:51
What are the chances he doesn't get caught? Seems slim...
@_date: 2019-02-08 02:00:25
..or even hear about it on the popular radio stations, like back in late 2017, here in Los Angeles. Kooky times.
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:46:28
You're welcome, man :D

USAA is the best damned bank, if I had to pick one. They've been giving me screaming deals on Insurance, and work with the US Army to give great incentives to veterans, family members, and people working hard every day to defend the constitution.

PNC is a terrible bank- I'm surprised OP stuck with them for 15 years..I had a car loan for 5 months and wanted to shoot myself in the face, for how difficult they made it for me to pay every month without calling them and paying a fee for the "convenience",
Basically, I called at least 6 times to request a "pin" to setup online payments, and never once received them..instead I received late payment notifications, with even more fees tacked on.
I just financed a new car--- and would never recommend PNC.

I used to serve this guy, at a restaurant I worked, in a hotel that he owns property in. Nice dude- family and friend oriented, with a genuinely kind demeanor. Bitcoin fan for sure.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:31:22
Ahhh, I may just change the video title to reflect that. Thanks, Harryhorss

Halvening. Time for its gains, breh. Said it would take 4 months, about 3 months ago :)
@_date: 2016-10-11 17:32:15
Yes sir. However, I was way more enamoured with Bitcoin before I ever took the time of day to listen to others and look at Ether. Still holding a lot of BTC, but the debates over blocksize really seemed childish to me, after a certain point.
@_date: 2016-10-11 17:37:51
One coin has enough people pumping it already :) 
@_date: 2016-10-09 01:33:15
As good a reason as most :D thx lol
@_date: 2016-10-29 10:09:51
I bought in when he said that. Thanks Mike!! (285$ to 700$ :)

I wish, man. The video device stopped recording after a limit was hit, since this was one of my longer interviews. About 5 minutes were lost, when I went to edit. Made me so depressed lol
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:34:48
For sure! Anytime that dude opens his mouth one learns so much about why we HODL 
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:06:27
:( Hopefully you didn't lose too much, man
@_date: 2016-07-07 11:45:20
Seriously. What a loser. Tell him to buy a green screen already.
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:52:04
I've definitely shifted in favor toward BTC, as you can hear in my videos, man-- check them out, with new eyes :)
