Develop a strategy for purchasing beforehand. US? Read about coinbase problems.. GDAX.. Gemini.. realize that buying $30 in BTC to hold on coinbase will not get you far if you want to a) send to a wallet b) send to an exchange. The fees associated will eat that money SO FAST. Want to get into alt coins? Look into GDAX or alternative, but know you will be waiting days to actually use the fund on an exchange.
I encourage everyone I know IRL to get involved in crypto but learn the ropes a bit first, otherwise you'll throw money away. The fees I paid to transfer my BTC when I first started out would now be worth hundreds if not thousands of dollars at today's price.

Depending on geography, use coinbase or equivalent.. could take a few days to see funds though. Otherwise use an Escrow to p2p sell someone who can send cash through venmo or equivalent. Either way it'll take a few days to "cash out" unless you know someone that can literally give you cash for your coins.

Without a lot of capital, you will almost definitely lose all your money. Or you have to be extremely lucky, know exactly what you're doing.. and even then you may lose all your money. Rule number 1 is don't short BTC.

So seized assets... Can you direct me to a ledger where I can see where those are being allocated? Or are they locked away in Ft. Knox with all the gold..

If you purchased BTC at this moment with a 20$ bill in CAD, you should receive 0.000876 BTC.
The thing is, those ATMs typically charge hefty fees (10-30%) . So your 20$ just became 18/14 (.000788/.00613). 
As for market price over 100k, either code error or blatant theft. You can try contacting the ATM owner or chalk it up to a $20 learning experience. If you want to purchase crypto or btc I highly recommend reading around the subs to find the easiest onramp for CAD. Coinbase works I believe in your country but BEWARE OF FEES. It may not be worth putting only 20$ in at once . Maybe LTC or ETH .. DYOR before getting into this game.
Sorry friendo

There was an interesting discussion late last night on about lithium storage efficiency but the discourse was regarding technological pertinence in the present. Examples included electric cars, IoT, and LED bulbs. Essentially, even though great ideas are discovered decades prior, it takes time and continuation of research and public discussion before something becomes widely accepted.
Merkle trees have been known for some time, yes. But block chain utilizing this nesting structure in conjunction with increased algorithmic security (SHA-512) are helping create the runway to mass adoption. It is more secure, it's permanent, it's decentralized. Whether or not you're into the moonboi theories doesn't matter, what does it that this is next gen tech for data storage that will become mainstream in the next decade. How that affects the economics of tokens remains speculation but I'm not responding to discuss that, merely to counter your statement of "it's been known for awhile so it's never gonna be anything more".
That's my 2¢ anyways.
