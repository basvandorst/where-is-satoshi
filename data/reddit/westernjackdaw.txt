I didn't know much about this guy, but just by judging on a few cases noted in this thread his judgment is so terrible he's a liability. He needs to relax, stop acting on impulse and stop showing trust for people without much proof, and he will be better.
In the context of this technology and this community, his attitude is not appropriate.
@_date: 2015-08-29 02:24:37
You shouldn't stop reading there though, because it's important to be aware and know about what these fuckers are up to.

I take serious issue with the iThingies. This is a bit on the radical side, looks like an Apple commercial.
As for the physical coin, I don't feel so strongly about it because this is a site aimed at newbies and anything that could resemble something to do with Bitcoin in a screen is going to be super confusing for the newcomer.
The alternative is doing away completely with the devices and the screens. Something like a pulsating network of interconnected nodes as a landing screen and buttons to go to the different sections, that can be left more or less like they are not for the time being.
Just trying to be constructive.

More creative ways to railroad the miners long term into big blocks.
If the miners are going to vote, it makes sense that they vote it both ways depending on what's more convenient for them and for Bitcoin. Miners also have an incentive to defend the value of Bitcoin.
In 2020 miners will be more capable to decide on the appropriate block size at the time than users can decide it now.
@_date: 2015-08-31 07:23:07
They are sweet money laundering machines though. Newly minted coins to an address of your choice that not even the guy selling you the device can trace.
So they have that going for them which is nice.
@_date: 2015-08-31 07:28:46
Blocksize is going to be directly set by human intervention so long as it isn't machines doing the transactions.
Bitcoin is mainly for human usage right now.

Except for the "stress tests" spamming the blockchain in September. 
Currently we are far from reaching capacity. If you look at transactions they are often very low too and fees are really low. One day the fee market will have to be tested or eventually mining will collapse and the whole system with it.
@_date: 2015-08-30 22:03:56
I think there's a bit of a leap from $1 and an interbank settlement network. The hyperbole for that doomsday scenario is unwarranted, and quite frankly it looks like populist politics to push the agenda of some together with the "big blocks" code.
@_date: 2015-08-30 21:46:28
They cannot predict emotional market reactions and I'm afraid we have plenty of those in here.
Simulation will have a bias towards the expected elements we introduce in them. Too many unknown unknowns.
@_date: 2015-09-11 07:34:23


That's because you are a complete moron, just check that out.
It's imbeciles like you and the kind of idiot who'd upvote you that I'm talking about. This community is chock-full with them.
@_date: 2015-09-10 21:32:28
I find it amazing that someone can be so stupid to think this spam attack has produced any important results for scalability.
@_date: 2015-09-11 22:58:30
If it's about then tone then it doesn't matter, does it? It's not like they give me vouchers or anything for the karma.
This attack simply makes life harder for people using Bitcoin. Namely nodes and also people executing transactions themselves or through services. May lose them money, time, resources. In that sense this is bad. And no, we basically learn nothing from this. Maybe a few dummies wake up to some realities but generally speaking nobody who could do anything about the current problems is going to learn anything from this.
PS: it does seem that because of my low karma or whatever reason my comments are censored until someone approves them. If I open threads unlogged I cannot see my comments for a while. Well duh, maybe I will post some jokes elsewhere to thwart that nonsense.
@_date: 2015-09-11 07:44:33


If only the problem wasn't already known or at least the attack could hope to show any unforeseeable effect. But that's just not the case.
This is more like you know there is a gaping hole if your roof and then you are happy it downpours on you just to feel vindicated that yeah, the fucking hole lets the water in.
Feel free to downvote away though. Maaku7 is still right and he knows what he's talking about. A bunch of guys who want to feel positive about everything prefer to click the red arrow on him or me and that's fair enough, whatever makes you guys happy.

I'm interested on how does it expose the user in any way if the maximum block height is persisted and signed in the transaction.
Maybe you have something somewhere about this or you can outline it here? note that there are many imaginable expiry mechanisms, this one I have in mind I don't see how it would expose the user in any way. But I'm happy to be proven wrong.
@_date: 2015-09-12 22:49:19
Transactions that expire unless included at a given height seem like a workable change. It's a big change, but otherwise the user doesn't have a way to signal that a given transaction with a given fee is only valid for them for a limited time.
RBF is great and all but it's essentially a different thing.
Yeah I know this is not a thing to lightly throw around but Cohen is right that the fee market would benefit of a tx/fee/time balancing mechanism.
@_date: 2015-09-10 21:34:28
Something as basic as this test can be reproduced no problem in TESTNET.
What you cannot reproduce in TESTNET is the panic, the moronic conclusions and the general idiocy of some people over here.
@_date: 2015-09-13 21:46:47
Because most nodes can't handle it, then you just thrashed the node network decentralization, making Bitcoin completely pointless.
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:54:55
I think Bram Cohen has a very strong point on the need to introduce protocol changes to make transactions expire, so a fee market can be more effective before we are under real strain.
Great conference so far.
@_date: 2015-09-13 10:16:38
Well yeah, zero-conf is not safe and low conf is as safe as it's hard to reorg the tail of the blockchain.
A transaction with expiry would immediately be a "slow transaction" only safe after a few confirmations minimum.
The fee/time market helps for a settlement kind of slow blockchain where only n-conf transactions are considered secure. I think that is the kind of blockchain that works as a base with the current characteristics of the blockchain and real-time, immediate payment is best done on a higher layer because of the security trade-offs.
I understand it's hard to accept changes that involve giving up on something we currently sort of have. But if you push for improving zero-confs or defend their current capabilities above other considerations, that is also a trade-off. It has to be considered.
@_date: 2015-09-10 21:40:48
Do you actually believe that nonsense? No, the problem is that Bitcoin currently is not ready for any attack. It's demonstrably cheap to saturate the network and create a massive backlog, and there are no simple solutions for this. People are working hard to solve this, Bitcoin won't just solve it on its own for some antifragile honeybadger meme nonsense.
@_date: 2015-09-10 21:37:39
How is that "disagreement on the consequences"?
That's disagreement on the immediate approach for scalability, something that this "test" does absolutely nothing to solve.
But everybody knew what would happen.
@_date: 2015-09-11 07:39:42
Not meaningfully so.
And you can create a closed environment TESTNET to test things like this, which for instance Rusty Russell already did.
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:31:12
Yeah that's a problem. Also, some of them cannot be canceled from software, it will override any measures to stop shut-down.
Even in my Linux nodes, just in case I keep a relatively recent snapshot copy of the blockchain in storage so I can re-launch a node relatively quickly. The re-indexing being so slow makes it worth it.
@_date: 2015-09-13 10:55:48
Yep, the number of people using bitcoin worldwide is probably a directly-correlating incentive for censorship, not the other way around...
@_date: 2015-10-14 21:51:42
There are plenty, they try different moderation approaches and they are just not great. People should consider why is this and bitcointalk.org where most actual discussion happens (other than complaining about and bitcointalk which apparently is what drives other places).
Might as well be that these approaches simply don't work well. And/or that the people running them are not the greatest at the job. Or that they are exceedingly negative and have perverse objectives.
Have a look at them and judge.
@_date: 2015-10-15 08:02:18
If you rebooted without shutting the client cleanly you might have borked the indexing. This problem happens in all platforms and it takes a long time for the blockchain to be re-indexed (typically several days).
@_date: 2015-10-14 21:45:44
They are downvoted regardless. It's called a herd, the trolls that are afraid of the new rules form a very close knit one.
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:33:48
Yes, that's right. Also it will sometimes override any attempts to stop it from software. Because welp Windows knows better than you or so it thinks. I've lost work I had left unsaved because of this a couple times, because in the office we run Windows.
@_date: 2015-10-15 08:09:49
Not sufficiently to be workable. It doesn't take long in reddit to notice the little arrow system on its own doesn't work if you value quality content and truth rather than feel good comments and convenient lies.
It's not a matter of ideology, it simply doesn't work. Because people actively work around it to promote their own interests and when things get heated they don't respect anything.
And this is why moderation is a huge thing all across reddit, even admins getting involved when anti-social behaviour can be helped somewhat. Controversy and the karma system just don't mix, and for many topics it simply cannot be helped in any other way than moderation.

You think 7 doesn't, or maybe they are not as competent?
