No yellow bar. I get a little progress bar "Authenticating to Poloniex" followed by "Fetching Balance from Poloniex", then it shows a header with "Poloniex $0.00" when it finishes. No errors or anything. 
I moved some BTC from my lending wallet to my exchange wallet on Poloniex and ran Sync Holdings and it showed the balance in my exchange wallet in the app. Moved it back to Funding wallet and the app now shows no holdings again. So it looks like the app is only pulling from the Exchange wallet balance. I can help with any more debugging requests if you want to use PMs or here is fine.

No, it used to be instant. 0 confirmation payments were commonly accepted. 0 fee transfers usually got included in the next block. RBF didn't exist. Transactions getting stuck were quite rare. I remember buying things and it'd only take 2 or 3 seconds for the website to see the payment and complete the sale. Some places would require a small fee (a fraction of a cent) to accept 0 conf payments just to be safe but not all did.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:12:45
The block limit was reached. There are more transactions being made than can fit into a 1MB block. A backlog started forming. Fees rose to compete for block space. 0 fee payments don't get confirmed anymore. Payments with low fees now regularly get stuck. 0 conf transfers can therefore no longer be trusted as they might never confirm. Transfers with even reasonable fees often take several blocks to confirm. These things combined mean that a payment could take 10-120 minutes or longer instead of the previous 2-3 seconds. This is the problem lightning network is attempting to solve. It's also the reason the "other coin" forked away.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:11:18
If coinbase batched their transactions (sent a bunch of withdrawals in a single transaction) and used segwit for those transactions, their transaction frequencies and sizes would be much smaller, and result in a much smaller mempool (transaction backlog). Additionally, they are adding fees which are higher than they need to be. The result is that they are both clogging up the network with unnecessarily frequent and large transactions, as well as paying too much for those transactions requiring everyone else to also pay more to compete for block space. 
TLDR; It seems that Coinbase is adding to both network congestion and high fees because they won't implement a few changes to their withdrawal system. This recent withdrawal outage of theirs shows just how big an impact they are having.

You could sell on an exchange then wire the funds to your bank. They will report it to the IRS so do make sure you pay your taxes on it. Assuming you do pay your taxes and have records you can show if asked, you'll be fine.   
Making many small deposits to your bank will actually look like structuring and get you flagged for money laundering which can result in your accounts being frozen and getting you under criminal investigation.  
In general, assuming you've done nothing wrong, you want to just do what you need to do in the most straightforward way possible because if you do things in an attempt to "go under the radar" you will end up looking very suspicious and causing problems for yourself.

Let's assume no other income to make this easier. Also we'll assume a single unmarried filing. These are the tax brackets for long term capital gains. The income falling within each range is taxed at the percent given. This means you don't pay any capital gains tax on the first $37,950 you cash out if you have no other income.
$0 - 37,950 - 0%
$37,951 - 418,400 - 15%
$418,401+ - 20%
So if you cash out $1m lump sum right now, the taxes break down like this.
* $37,950 @ 0% = $0
* $380,450 @ 15% = $57,067.50
* $581,600 @ 20% = $116,320
* Total tax owed = $173,387.50
$500k now, $500k in 2018
* 2017: $37,950 @ 0% = $0
* 2017: $380,450 @ 15% = $57,067.50
* 2017: $81,600 @ 20% = $16,320
* 2018: $37,950 @ 0% = $0
* 2018: $380,450 @ 15% = $57,067.50
* 2018: $81,600 @ 20% = $16,320
* Total tax owed (2017 + 2018) = $146,775
By cashing it all out now, the last $500k is taxed fully at 20%. By waiting until next year, the first $37,950 of that last $500k is not taxed at all, and the next $380,450 is only taxed at 15%.

Short term gains are gains made after holding under a year and are taxed at your income tax rate. Long term gains, those held over a year, are taxed at the long term capital gains rate, which for most people is 15%, but always lower than your income tax rate

Gemini doesn't charge for ach. Then it's just the 0.2% trading fee (I think). You have to wait a few days before withdrawing for the ach to clear and your bank has to be in their small list of supported banks, but that's currently the best route. I'm planning on opening a new bank account that's supported so I can do this. If you need instant, go with Coinbase but you'll pay more in fees.

You sell goats in a small village. A customer wants to buy a goat, but you have no banks so people have put their money into bitcoin. Your customer goes to the village center which has a few computers hooked up to the internet. He sends you payment then comes to get his goat. You don't have internet near your goat farm, but you're connected to the satellite so you can see he sent you payment and you give him his goat.
Or, you live in an area that caps your bandwidth. You want to run a full node, but downloading blocks eats away at your cap. Connecting to a satellite reduces your bandwidth usage.
Or, you're using an air gapped laptop to sign transactions from your wallet for security reasons. You can now connect that laptop to the satellites so your laptop can generate its own transactions without connecting to the internet.
Or, your internet connection is terrible. You can usually broadcast transactions since they're small, but downloading blocks and staying in sync with the blockchain is literally impossible. Connect to a satellite and now it's simple.

When you're doing contract work, it's generally advisable to charge around double what you would make in a similar salary-based job. This is to cover the additional taxes you pay when self employed, and the unpaid time spent marketing yourself and any overhead time/monetary expenses that an employer would typically pay, which add up to a lot more than you might expect. Also, your clients get to write off what they pay you on their taxes, where employee paychecks cost them additional tax money, so it's not as huge a difference to them as the numbers would make it seem. So charging $82 an hour might be for a job that would pay a salaried employee around $40-$45 an hour, or roughly $80k-$90k a year, which isn't that uncommon in the tech industry.

* Fees. LN is amazingly exciting, but it will be a while before it's widely used, and isn't a cure-all. SW is a good step but adoption is slow and more on chain scaling will be needed within the next few years and I don't hear much about concrete plans for that. I think we should try to get fees as low as possible even during usage peaks while we're still in the public adoption phase of things. $20 fees or whatever they were during the last top should be avoided. Also trying to figure out what fee to use is complex and daunting to newbies. We've instituted the fee market prematurely in my opinion and it's hurting adoption.
* The entirely of Bitcoin Cash is a blemish on BTC. I think it's good that the fork happened as now people like Roger Ver are no longer a part of BTC, but it does highlight a lack of urgency around the scaling and fee issues. I think once BCH inevitably dies off BTC will be stronger for it though.
* XRP, libra, and other centralized "cryptos" being too closely associated to BTC. They really are not the same thing at all and should not be a part of this space. People still see XRP as a cheaper, faster version of BTC and don't understand how wrong that is.
* Public perception is immature. "Magic internet money," "HODL!", "TO THE MOON!", "when lambo?!". It's all kind of juvenile. BTC is maturing, but is still often viewed as an internet meme.
* The focus on price and lack of even basic fundamental understanding. I know several people who have no clue what the word blockchain even means, but have price tickers on their phone. I've even heard the phrase "I don't care what it is, if it makes me money." Just makes it look like a get rich quick scheme. Yes, BTC will make a lot of people wealthy, but it will also revolutionize the way we store and transfer value, worldwide. That's a fundamental shift in human society, but people only see a number.

OP, if you're curious as to why the debate still hasn't reached a conclusion, it's because so many people have attitudes like this. The whole, "My side is right and everyone else is an idiot" approach leads to stalemates, division, and contempt rather than compromise, cooperation, and respect. The truth is that both sides have brilliant minds pushing forward solutions, but the base of each side is so toxic that it makes reaching a consensus impossible. Personal attacks, censorship, and stubborn close-mindedness are seen as the only way to progress an agenda these days. It's not about doing what's best for bitcoin, it's about being right, and that means that nobody is.

The bitcoins were sent from the address you posted, to here:
Following them from that address (likely a hotwallet for an exchange) they were then transferred in the following transaction:
From there, they were sent to two different addresses. The good news is that half your coins remain unspent in one of them ( where they current sit waiting for you to get them out. The rest, well, they get combined with funds in other exchange wallets and sent all over the place over and over. I can't track them much farther than this point. Here's a visualization of the trip your coins took:
Click the Yellow circle to see the next step. As you can see half of them end up at the address 1KQM6trPRWU3gyywDwoQoHTvjEYpfq9GSs and the rest become impossible to track down.

I'm the same, but I mined my coins so when I think of profit/loss, it's in btc, not usd, since I didn't directly put in any usd to start with. Also my goal is to make more btc, not more usd. I've gone from 2 to 5, and even though with the crash the value in of my account went down a little (2 peak vs 5 I still see myself as profiting 150%. It's all about perspective :)

These have all been deleted, do you have the original text so I can flag it when I see it?

There have been in the past, but it's based on the hashing power of the mining network, which has only gone up with the increased interest in bitcoins. Asics are also machines orders of magnitude faster at mining than PCs that are slowly entering the market, so difficulty is expected to not only keep rising, but to rise much higher than it is now.

For what it's worth I've been a member for 3 months now, have made bets, withdrawn, invested, deposited, etc etc without any issues. Even been in the chat while Dooglus (owner/admin) discussed openly the security methods he used, while taking suggestions on improvements. The site is secure, the only threat would be Dooglus running off with the balance, if he was going to do that, he probably would have back when there was over 60k btc in the site.
Of course, use your own judgement, if you don't think it's safe, don't send your coins there. Period. I've got coins there though and am not worried about losing them (unless of course, I go on a gambling bender and lose them that way).

The right column shows the recent transactions. No human would trade like (or could, that's a lot of small orders really really fast)

I'd try emailing the admins of all the exchanges you think they could have been sent to, and see if they can look up the addresses involved to see if it's one of theirs. If you find a hit, they may be able to help you transfer them out.

Then yes, you know the risks and can afford to take them. Welcome to the party.

The difficulty is already filled in on that calculator. It's expected to rise about 15% in 2 days (via  Higher difficulty means smaller rewards, so in 2 days you'll receive about 15% less from mining than you currently do. Difficulty goes up about every 2 weeks.

the API seems functional, but a withdraw attempt just returned "disabled"
