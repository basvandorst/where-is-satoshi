I am familiar with that. Looking at bitcoin's usual ups and downs this doesn't seem like something that will cause the downfall of btc? Or will the MtGox situation serve to alienate both users and the public from ever putting real trust (and more $$$) behind btc?

I don't have any coins on gox. However I would choose to hope for the best for those who do.

So, would the price begin to increase (theoretically) since the dump is finished? I'm guessing people will want to be buying these cheap coins?

If could be because they are shutting down the entire platform. OR it could be that they are about to reopen things. Who is to say?

Even though you're kind of being a dick I do appreciate the alternate view. You *are* browsing so maybe you could shed some constructive light on the opposing opinion of "to the moon?"

Are you.... Saracoinbit? Or possibly her SO?

You're holding out on me aren't you?

What was the original title?

I'd really like him to elaborate a little on who these "buyers" were.

Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much for your help. I'm also having problems with my tip bot, but, if you send me your address I'll send you a beer. Thanks for your help.

Thanks, I appreciate your input.
What do *you* think big_choed?

This is a little off topic but.... Isn't there a way to trace back the funds that Gox does or does not have? It's all on the block chain, no? I understand that the addresses are anonymous but isn't there some massive cold storage wallet that should be available to check on?

What's the logic behind that? Is there a reason to think it will inflate astronomically again like last year?
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:20:34
I follow that idea but other than the general public picking up Bitcoin as a common form of currency what chance does it have of making it to that point? Really interesting idea however. 
Also, just what decides that the bitcoin market is $8bn? The going price?
Edit: Just to be clear, I am not deciding one way or another yet. I'm weighing options.

No, which is basically a given here. Not yet anyways.

Does anyone have the original version of the post? Apparently it was changed?
Edit: Here's what the original looked like before Coinbase and the rest changed it:

I've been watching the btc market for a year. Some of this is regret at scoffing when the price was 12 when I first considered it. The rest is that is may continue to be a viable investment due to the rapid interest and continually growing use as a currency.

Dude, your *name* is bitcoins. That means you had to have been around early on. Which means you are probably sitting on some nice chunk of change. How about you gift me one you greedy bastard.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:31:28
Meaning that it has been removed, essentially?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:24:40
I was thinking the same thing. He refused to state what his good news was on reddit the other day (yesterday?) and even backpedaled a little on the topic. Now this?
I for one hope he starts blabbing a little more.

If I can make a little supplemental income while holding for the long run, why not? I may hold until next year or begin using btc to do daily transactions but until amazon starts accepting it I'll use the cash!
