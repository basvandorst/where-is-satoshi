Right, authy works just fine for the new account I have. Unfortunately, this account was is in no way linked to authy before I lost access to it.

If it were a bank, I wouldn't be having this problem.

Wow, your're right. I should'nt have 'ignored' this warning I never heard.

Its a nice suggestion, but its not really a solution to my problem.

You make it sound as if someone made an argument to me which explained why I shouldn't be using coinbase in the first place. Which is what everyone here seems to assume. Like the guy below who said I "ignored warnings" about coinbase.
I only made this post because as you said, the only way to get coinbase's attention is to post on this subreddit. I have way too much to worry about in my life to add this apparently toxic community to the list though. I have had this account with coinbase for years, and at the time they seemed like a reputable company, and I still didn't know much about bitcoin. The only reason I have endured these needlessly vitriolic comments is to get my money back. So, to answer your question. Yes I will be moving away from coinbase, and I will also be moving away from bitcoin.


They are just people like you and me, with more or less or different information. Fuck me for not knowing everything about bitcoin. If you guys really want bitcoin to become more viable, and for more people to start using it, then it might help to be...you know... helpful, when someone doesn't understand something as well as you or if they are just getting started with bitcoin.
At any rate for me. All of this is simply not worth the headache and the passive aggressive replies when all I'm doing is asking for help. Good riddance bitcoin...
