What's the ratio of price / Bitcoin

Huh?  "Bet 50,000 BTC for each md"?
How does that make any sense at all?
The event is a scam.  This guy is part of it

On the website they refer to him as a "Managing Director"
Morgan Stanley's own website calls him a "Financial Advisor" this is basically the lowest level title which is given to new employees. 
NO official Morgan Stanley info I could find calls him an MD much less makes any reference to Bitcoin.
At the very least it's clear that they are being misleading in implying he has something to do with Bitcoin and the firm. He is on the retail side and has no influence whatsoever on corporate decisions.

No / his role at MS has NOTHING to do with Bitcoin whatsoever he has NO management power or authority whatsoever.  He is a retail broker, period; he doesn't even work in the same building as anyone with ties to actual management.  Look into it.

Just suspect of this thing and that it seems they are implying thst MS corporate is somehow involved when they are not.

"Morgan Stanley Managing Director" 
1- there are about 50,000 managing directors it's not an actual directorship like the old partnership days, it's a bs title they give to people who sell a lot of shit
2- the guy is not there representing the firm
3- looks like he hasn't done shit in the space
4- from his bio he appears to be a retail broker, probably looking to rally up some rich Bitcoin nerds personal accounts by selling crappy overpriced Morgan Stanley managed accounts

Also, being "enthusiastic" doesn't mean shit.
100,000 people on this board are enthusiastic.
Has he actually done anything? At all? One advisory role? One investment? Does he even own a Bitcoin?
I don't think he's that well connected as no one seems to have heard of him.

Another poster told me they met him and he's a nice guy. That's great but I'm only talking about accuracy.
It's total bullshit to say Branson is a host of something when it's simply renting his property and it's also total bullshit to imply someone is there on behalf of a corporation when they are not. Using an incorrect title is an outright fucking lie.
BONUS: can some reporter out there call Morgan Stanley spokesman for comment? I can fuckijg guarantee that he not only doesn't represent the bank but that they don't even know he is going and wouldn't allow it to be mentioned just like Branson's own spokesman distanced himself from the bullshit claims.
BONUS 2:  If he wants to come on here himself and explain and says he's actually representing Morgan Stanley and verifies it's really him I will donate $100 to bitgive and provide blockchain proof.
My guess is that he's a guy who's mildly interested in Bitcoin and is using the MS name so he can try to get contacts with rich Bitcoin people to sell them bullshit crappy investments.
We need more honesty in this space not more fast and loose bullshit.

He's not involved in Bitcoin. He wrote a paper on his own mentioning Bitcoin.
He's NOT in MS management and he or someone else LIED about his title, changing the lowest title the firm has for the highest one.
Pretty big fucking deal.
