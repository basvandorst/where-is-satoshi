I get what you're saying, but this will be for long term investors looking for a secure way to invest in BTC. A lot of people are uncomfortable with having their BTC sit in a virtual wallet, after what happened to Mt Gox.

Question for OP: what kind of insurance do you have against hacking or malware? You're using a hot wallet so I'm assuming you're aware of the risks right?

what about all these governments trying to create their cryptocurrencies to compete with BTC? Do you think BTC will survive if all governments flat out BAN it and force people to use their own? I'm just wondering because I'd like to invest but this war on bitcoin is starting to make me question it...
