Good point, they might wake up and see the price and be all 'Hell yea, hella profit time' and sell, might be right, might dip below 9k again when/if that happens......We'll see what's up with the Chinese New Year in a couple days as well. These next few weeks in February are going to set the tone for 2018 I believe.

anybody checking out the buy orders on GDAX right now??

These Fk'ers and their FUD talk, really has me considering pulling out $1,000 worth and keeping it 'until it drops to 6k'.......ARGH!!....WHAT TO DO??

Lost hope, lol. I saw a couple high buy orders but dreams quickly crushed in the following minutes. haaa. Just wanted to see if anybody else was checking it out. Hope we get more Green Candles, or maybe more red so I can buy more. I think either way I'll be happy. Kinda weird......

Dollar Cost Averaging. So you don't end up losing the $750/weekly if Bitcoin tanks (you never know, hope not). Just put $200 (or whichever your amount is) every Friday (or whatever day) FOREVVERRR (LOL), but as long as you can comfortably put more without worrying. 
So you still have your 'Savings' account along with your 'Bitcoin' account. And both will have a good amount in the long run!! :0)
