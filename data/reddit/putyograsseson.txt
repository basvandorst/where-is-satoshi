IIrc uninstalling the app doesn’t do anything for your keys as they’re still in your phone’s secure enclave, you gotta wipe your wallet from within the app.
I would also wipe the phone itself after that so there is 100% no trace left of your seed/keys on your smartphone which makes it essentially a cold wallet.

@_date: 2019-09-17 17:49:28
If you didn’t jailbreak your iPhone and kept it updated then it is 100% fine.
For the future I would recommend something like breadwallet, it’s an iOS bitcoin wallet that stores the private keys in the secure enclave of your phone where other apps don’t have access, plus there is no server/account that can be hacked/compromised with this method.
If you want to be extra safe you can wipe the wallet from within the app and afterwards wipe your entire phone, turning it essentially into a cold wallet.
So finally you “only” have to keep your analog piece of paper (or wherever you wrote down your backup seed phrase on) save.
Thanks for sharing your story, it will hopefully help others to stay safe in the turbulent digital future that is coming.
