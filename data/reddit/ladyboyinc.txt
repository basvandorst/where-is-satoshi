They will! Question is, will they have support from the Bitcoin community? We've been on board for a few days. Made the official announcement today. I know a handful of other site owners who are adding to their sites as well.

Will do. We're very excited to get these new sites open to affiliates and hopefully integrat Bitcoin into the affiliate system.

You'll always have some people making comments about such things, it unfortunately comes with the territory. :-(  "Thick skin" and all that.

Give in to the dark side...

Just trying to keep up with technology and support a new currency at the same time. It takes a little bit to get your head around Bitcoin. You're going to see a lot more porn sites offering it as more people understand it. For me, understanding it was the issue. Now I fully embrace it and support it.

Would you rather sites not accept Bitcoin? Or just not tell anyone about it so you can figure it out on your own? Seems illogical not to be happy about new businesses supporting Bitcoin.

We would be interested in that. I believe understanding it is the biggest hurdle currently for Bitcoin. Most in our industry are fairly tech savvy, but even this took a little while to grasp at first for most of us.

hell yea. thank you for the support!

Sure do, and thank you! Sending you a private message now.

We're averaging a handful a day. It's a good start. As Bitcoin gains traction, we expect to see a lot of new customers in the future. An anonymous way of paying is very important for a niche like ours, as many would-be customers don't want any association with joining a porn site, let alone a kinky one, or a transsexual site. We often get emails asking for a more discreet way to pay, and now they have it. :-)

Hi, being a new site our affiliate system is still in Beta and we've only started accepting Bitcoin for our own internal traffic. We hope to have a Bitcoin / affiliate solution shortly, as we'll be coming out of Beta soon for all affiliates.
