your first response was all i needed, but thanks again!

thanks very much, will look into it all. Someone (I would if i could program, lol) should definitely compile all this into one super simple offline / app combo to make average joe comfortable with cold storage.
That aside, I'm switching to android very shortly, just because of bitcoin. But yeah, the emphasis of my post was on a wallet app that never saw the private key. I'm not sure there is one to date.

So in light of all this and to crossover into cold storage territory. Is there an app / html source combo out there that does the following:
- always offline computer stores private keys
- always offline computer scans address QR code via webcam
- always offline computer creates QR transaction info + signature
- phone app scans that and sends to network
Armory et al look so much more complicated to me, and also involve USB key data transfer which could get compromised.

Yeah. Not sure I follow though, when you scan the flip side of the verso, isn't it scanning the private key? To be fully cold both ways, you need the key to never see an online device... Unless I misunderstood how verso is working.

yip. crystal now. thanks!

That vid seems to be it. I don't see why anything should be limited. All the logic to create a signed transaction is set in the protocol and immutable no? So any input info required could be handled phone / app side, the signature handled offline laptop side, and then the sending handled phone / app side again.
Feels like this could all be presented in a much friendlier way than whatever Armory or others are doing. When I read their ubuntu based how to's, my head explodes. And I'm not THAT technologically challenged, i'm just not a computer science major.

AH HA. Thanks so much to everyone, and THANK YOU rrobukef :) That last one really clarified it for me! 99.9% sure i got it now. So to confirm: 
I plug in the desired transaction + my private key into my hash function. Out comes a signature. The network can verify that the signature for that transaction was created with that private key and that I own it. But it can't do anything else.

thanks so much for trying but sorry, still not clear (arg). 
Basically here's what I can't wrap my head around: to enable a transaction from an address, you submit information to the network, in whatever form. You guys are saying not the private key, fine, just the public key. If all the network needs to confirm a transaction is your public key and now THAT information is public. How can it not be reused?
I think what i'm really dying for here is a very simplistic A -&gt; B -&gt; C (however many steps) explanation of one transaction, that shows me how I can while not disclosing my private key, enable the network to agree I have it, more than once, without it being able to use the information from the first transaction to say it knows the private key as well. 
And additionally following your comment, my understanding to date is: public key = address. From the private key you can get public key but not the opposite. Are you saying there's three things here? An address, a public key and a private key, or that the address is the combination of both? Or what?
