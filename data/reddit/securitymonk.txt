Aside from following the security engineers or organizations directly on whatever webpages they have, podcasts are one of the best ways.
Check out this link: [
Crypto-gram is on of my favorites (here is the podcast link): [
If you have Telegram,  "IT Security Alerts" channel is good as well.

I use to work for Google several years back. The amount of data that I was able to see on someone just off of their gmail account was disturbing. I could see every phone you had ever put your gmail account on. From the phone, I could then see all of the previous Google/gmail accounts that had ever been tied to it previously, so it could basically tell me if you were using a used phone or sharing it with someone else. Next, I could see every app you had installed on your phone in realtime, without your permission, even if it wasn't from the Play Store. I also could see your last physical location, it would tell me your last physical location based on data being reported from your phone.
Scary stuff. I think what would be more worthwile would be to get more into encrypting your data and moving away from using these services that are completely aimed at collecting your data and spying on it. You know, don't upload your data directly to the Google or Apple Cloud, and don't use their email services as well. I think the reality is that you can't escape having your personal info collected on current phones as, that is what all these phones are designed to do. Collect data. Even websites are doing it now.

Security Expert here. Having 100% privacy on your digital life is almost impossible. Most people who believe they are fully secure, really aren't. It requires a higher than average technical knowledge to properly implement them and on top of that you have to make sure you are always up to date on what is happening on the latest exposed exploits/vulnerabilities as new ones are always constantly being discovered before they can patched in time.
The best thing that I can say to you or anyone who actually wants to truly have a better lock down on their own personal privacy and security is basically this, it all boils down to trust. You basically want to never have to put trust into someone or someone's code that you can never see. You also have to keep in mind that while someone can have something completely open sourced, it can still leak metadata that will expose you. Also, companies that are based in countries such as the U.S. must allow surveillance capabilities be made available to them whenever they request it. If they do not comply when they are asked for this access, they cannot operate in the US (google 5eyes, 9eyes, and 14eyes). Many people who believe that they have a safe vpn, really don't. As what is the point of actual privacy if the government has a straight backdoor into all of it?
**The amount of things to cover are not enough for me to list, but this would be a good strong foundation:**
**1.** Have an Operating System with no backdoors. Linux is pretty much your only option. Qubes OS and Tails OS are linux based ones that are popular for security, but to many are very extreme for the average person. I think just using a linux based distro like Ubuntu with full disk encryption would be a good first start.
**2.** Always use encryption when you can. Make sure your phone, desktop, laptop's hard drive is fully encrypted if possible.
And since we are taking about encryption I must also mention TrueCrypt 7.1a. This is a free encryption tool on the web that is believed to be completely untouchable by even the FBI. It will take some time to learn how to use, but I feel like it is worth making you at least aware of it's existence depending how deep you want to go with security.
**3.** Use a password manager like Keepass, so you are not using the same passwords, for other accounts. It will also allow you to make really ridiculously long strong passwords that would take someone forever to crack, and the best part is you don't ever have to remember them.
**3.** Try to migrate your calls and texting to a secure messaging app. Such as Telegram or Signal.
**4.** Use a non 5, 9, 14 eyes vpn. NordVpn is one that is free of all of this that I hear also has very strong encryption on all your traffic.
**5.** If you are tech savy enough, look into taking full control of your own router with something like the open source Tomato firmware. You'll want to set the vpn up on the router. This will make sure that all your internet traffic is passing through VPN at all times, which would be very ideal for maintaining no leaks of your actual ip address to the public interwebs.
I hope this helps a bit. I don't usually post on here, but dammit I love talking about anything infoSec.
