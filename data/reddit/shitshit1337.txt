hmm... I doubt you understand invesment. I don't. But even I understand that a significant thing such as this, even if it is far from now will have an effect on the value of this thing.

I am really sorry to hear that as we admire brainy peeps like u home boy!

That was very mean. It hurts coming from a big person  such as yourself. Someone that is so grown up that he always needs to have the last word. But i stay on my knees and continue my praise of such divine character such as you. Thank you for beeing around to let creative people that acctualy do stuff, like the ones creating this game, know what and how they should do stuff different. You and your kin makes the world go round!!
