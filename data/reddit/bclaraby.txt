Bitcoin's been attacked plenty of times over its lifetime.  It's far, far easier to attack exchanges though as they're a central point of failure (which, incidentally, goes against the entire core ethos of Bitcoin, but you know, whatever).
Whatever happened to decentralized exchanges?

Everyone craps on regulators but the hard truth is that these utopian ideals are exactly that: ideals. Lots of great ideas work well on paper or as thought experiments but they do not scale.  As soon as you begin to set up a system like this, especially if it 'functions', it invites bad actors and people who wish to take advantage of that system to come in and find flaws or ways to pull it all apart for their own benefit.
Ethereum's recent DAO disaster is a perfect example of this.

Now, I preface this as a general 'pro-Bitcoin' person.  I'm not a fanatic, but I like what Bitcoin is and has the potential to be.
That said, facts are facts:
I suspect people aren't tracking the +200% because most people who got into Bitcoin did not get in back when it was in the $100 - $200 range.
That +200% growth is only relevant for those who already had Bitcoin pre-boom.
For the people who bought in when Bitcoin was surging, if they're lucky, they're breaking even.
The '+' growth is only relevant compared to when you jumped on and how far back you're willing to hold your goal posts (for most, it's when they bought in).
For the people who bought Bitcoin in 2014, they most likely lost money (or, more specifically, buying power) this year.  It doesn't mean that they won't get it all back in 2015, but if you bought in in January, expecting to be a millionaire by December, you're probably sitting on a ball of sad right now.
Here's hoping that 2015 swings for the fences!

All the better to appease the big money interests who want someone to be held accountable when/if things go sour. SEC won't back Bitcoin exactly because it's decentralized.
This seems like a plan designed to create a top-down structure that, at least, optically, will allow it to get some sort of stamp of approval. Once SEC verified, big money interests will then be free to dive in.
Whomever is involved in the process clearly has figured out that there's a lot of money waiting in the wings and if they have to rip the beating heart out of Bitcoin in order to get at it... So be it.
To that end, IMHO, this community will continue to see 'shills' and whatnot until there is enough consensus (read: backroom politics) to ensure that a hard fork takes place.
As a side benefit to, well, pretty much any world-level government, if the one legitimate threat to their power tears itself apart from the inside then that's even better.
There's too much to gain and too little to lose by creating a rift in the Bitcoin community/coin thus we have the current situation.

I think one of the good things about having the code be open source - and the community, together, actively maintaining it - is that as the technology becomes available the community can roll with the punches.

Large-scale, I'm trying to engage the Bitcoin community in a  discussion about how we can extend Bitcoin (by using it) while also showing that we can be doing good things with it (not just being 'silk road bandits' as the media would like to portray users of the currency).
1 BTC = $580-ish right now.  Therefore 1 BTC could go directly to a community or organization on the ground - doing whatever we choose to sponsor as a community - and do some real good for people who need it.

The one thing to be aware of is that Bitcoin is still vulnerable to, say, China (or anyone with the money to invest) investing $10-20 Billion in Mining to work towards getting that 51% share and thus control of the currency.  Until the market becomes more robust, and another major player steps up to counter such a move, it's an issue.
Why would anyone do that?  If you wanted to destroy bitcoin, that'd be one way.
And if you don't think that someone would burn $10-ish Billion dollars on a whim, take a look at all those Ghost Cities being built around the world - well, not exactly a whim, but you get what I mean.  (or look at the Gold Dinar and how much was spent on the effort to destroy that before it got off the ground).
Bitcoin's market cap is still tiny on a world stage.  I'm not sure how Bitcoin can protect itself from such a threat, but its a vulnerability that needs to be scrutinized and prepared for - especially as the currency gains world attention and interest.

You don't have to pay it though.  There are people on there who do sell BTC around market rates, they might not be online at the moment, but they do exist.
People in general are selling high like this right now because it's been so volatile lately.  When I bought in it was just before the ride up and it was pretty close to market rate.
You can also go on there yourself and put forward an offer to buy at or around market rate and see if anyone's willing to sell to you.

I understand that in the context of one or two cities, but not in the context of 10+ entire cities being built.
The myth comes off as spin to a degree, sure, but no one could look at the state of some of these places (many of which are not even being properly maintained) and say 'well, we thought they'd fill up fast'.  They weren't all built at the same time.  They were built knowing that the previous cities were not filling up according to plan.
One or two would be a mistake. 10+, that's not an 'oops we thought we'd have more people buying in'.

It's a factor of youth and a still (relatively) small distribution coupled with a massive demand and a ton of speculation investors betting on its future. (And a few million people hoping to make a quick cash-out - buy low, sell high).
Once more bitcoin is in more people's hands it will start to level off (And once the Whales holding onto massive chunks of BTC decide to cash out).
Even now, in dollar terms, if someone wanted to just utterly flood the Dollar market with their own $Trillion of cash that they have lying around, and destabilize the market, they could.
It'd probably take that amount to even make it wobble at this point, but theoretically, it could happen.

I was thinking about the idea of how do we use Bitcoin for good - how many kids could be vaccinated for 1 BTC?  How many schools could be built?
We should use BTC for more than just the odd Subway sandwich - and with the price of 1 BTC skyrocketing, even fractions of BTC can be a huge help.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:29:15
Bitcoin isn't a currency right now.  It's a commodity.  Once it stabilizes again it will be a currency, but right now - even though it's 3-4 years old - it's too new.  It's right on the cusp of mass-market awareness/acceptance.  AKA, BTC is going to be all over the place for the foreseeable future, until everyone who wants to buy in to cash out has made their money, really.
Once a good chunk of the Whales have cashed out (those who bought a shitload at like $1-$10) then it'll start to stabilize again.  Then again, I could be entirely wrong... so hit me up with some knowledge if I am.  Thanks!

Right now it's a commodity - primarily because users are treating it as one. Many are trying their hand at 'buy low, sell high' and hoping to make out like bandits.
Eventually BTC will reach a greater, more diffuse distribution and it'll start to level out.  Especially once more countries enter the market.
Eventually it'll become as unexciting (comparatively) as USD.

If they export it to their fiat currency, yes.
But if they then go on to trade in Bitcoin, based on the value of bitcoin (no fiat currency) then it becomes a Bitcoin transaction.
The cost of fiat is the cost of exchanging into Bitcoin, just as you'd convert Euros to Dollars, etc.  Those purchases aren't then Euro purchases, but Dollar purchases.
Once Bitcoin levels off, this will be more likely to happen.
Remember, back when the Dollar was tied to the Gold standard, the dollar had these kinds of wild swings as well - because Gold was a commodity and the value could vary wildly.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:06:25
That's the point.  These are scenarios that need to be pushed into the limelight, debated, prepared for.  If they're ruled out, amazing.  Fantastic.
But weaknesses need public scrutiny to build confidence. Only by defeating these weaknesses, pulling down ways to destroy confidence in Bitcoin as a currency (not just a commodity) can we stabilize it and help it gain wider acceptance.

Yes. Yes they did.
I would've bought that argument if they had only built one city, realized that it wasn't making any money and they stopped.

From your linked article:
An attacker can:
- Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
Wouldn't that pretty much allow them to cement themselves as the defacto fork in the chain?  Once you've got the 51% the only way you're going to lose it is if you lose 51% control.  If you don't let anyone mine anymore valid blocks, that does more than 'gum up the works'.

The huge swings in price are coming from people treating the currency as a commodity (hell, in Canada, they've pretty much legally called Bitcoin a commodity).
The wild swings are happening because people are buying in low to try and sell high, like a commodity.  Once a majority of the people who have a shitton of Bitcoins sitting around (that they bought for cheap) sell off, once it becomes more evenly distributed, the prices will stabilize and you'll have a functioning currency.
Right now, bitcoin is volatile because users are making it volatile.
