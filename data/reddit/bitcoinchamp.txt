You guys are being unfair to Zane. You act as if he is intentionally feeding misinformation to the community. Now why would he purposely feed misinformation if he knows those deadlines would pass and he'd have to keep pushing them back further. I don't recall any other exchange that's been hacked in the past having a PR rep accessible 24hrs a day to answer questions. When he knows something you'll know something. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:57:59
So you had 2 separate accounts on coinbase? They only allow one per user maybe that's why they no longer allow you to do business with them.

I will say this. If bitfinex makes its customers whole without regulators and courts sticking their noses in this situation would at least have some sunshine in what most would consider a terrible storm. A lesson could be learned here about the bitcoin community that we can handle our business without outside scrutiny. You wouldn't see any banks on wall street reimbursing customers out of their own pockets that's for damn sure!
I would like to add that Coinbase should take note of what a responsive representative looks like. Has done his job well here these last 20 hrs.

Brian I think your company has done an amazing job bringing bitcoin to the masses but on the flip side your customer service department falls well below that of Walmarts. This should be top priority for your company at the moment improving customer service response times oh and how about a marketing department or at least a PR Rep?

I think Zane did a great job keeping people in the loop with information he either knew or was allowed to share. If you think there was any better way for this situation to have played out which would garner more money back to the people you're crazy. Bankruptcy would have taken years with a much lesser payout. I think you just like throwing gas on the fire. Yea the situation sucks but I don't ever remember Kapeles keeping everyone updated when Gox went bust.

The fact he keeps saying customer losses instead of bitfinex losses seems like it's the customer who loses.

Trading on an exchange you work for is unethical and should be illegal. If you work for a casino you are forbidden to gamble there. This info alone should be enough to put them out of business by taking your business elsewhere.

I've read a few responses pertaining to your insurance policy and in each response I read customers are covered for losses in the hot wallet. What about cold storage coins or coins that people put in the vault or multisig cold storage. Are those covered by insurance?

People are going to feel stupid if they come back in 24 hrs and say they sold equity in the company and have managed to pay back every single customer. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:31:05
If we have to rely on every single bitcoin user to learn how to secure their own bitcoin properly bitcoin will never go mainstream. This has been said for 7 years and still applies today. Though it has gotten easier with wallets such as trezor it's still to complex for the average person.
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:31:57
An exchange with tens of thousands if not hundreds of existing customers is not worthless.

They will sell equity to an investor in exchange for the funds. There's no way they will file bankruptcy here. Owning 51% of your business is better than owning nothing.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:54:11
But then people who held cash or other crypto would lose anyway. It's cutting your finger off to spite your face. Bitfinex knows they are in control here. Either all customers take a 36% haircut or a bankruptcy proceeding takes 50+% haircut from everyone. Either way everyone is getting the haircut. They know this we know this this is why they made this decision.

To the people here saying they're swamped with support tickets I'm here to tell you that's false. I have 2 support tickets in since end of August. No response and no solution to my problems.

Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme. Sure some look at it that way but I suggest you do your due diligence,  research everything there is to know and understand why bitcoin is superior to government fiat. Only then would I suggest you start buying some. Learn how to use them store them and spread the knowledge to others in way that Inspires others you know to want to own some besides them thinking they will become rich. I've done literally thousands of hours of research myself and some things on bitcoin still confuse me. Mostly the technical stuff. It's a fascinating technology. Welcome aboard and good luck in your endeavors with bitcoin.

Got one today. I paid my bitcoin gains so they got some fucking nerve sending me a letter. 
The letter states anytime you trade bitcoin etc into another token it needs to be reported. How the hell am I supposed to figure out all my alt coin purchases for the last 2 yrs? They were 99.9% wash sales as I purchased the alt immediately after buying the bitcoin.

Gemini works great. The only issue people would have is if they don't use a major bank they would then need to send a wire transfer to Gemini to link their bank account which cost 25 dollars at most banks. But once people get passed that hurdle it's smooth sailing on gemini. I've recommended over a dozen people to Gemini and none have had a single issue. Customer support is night and day compared to Coinbases nonexistent support. Hope this helps.
Fyi: if the person you're trying to get set up on an exchange isn't 100% motivated into getting into crypto the wire transfer scenario becomes an issue. You'll need to stay on top of them and help them initiate the transfer. Basically kick them in the ass to get motivated. After that they'll become pros. 
I've emailed gemini asking them to carry more coins. It wouldnt hurt if others emailed them too to show demand for more currencies.

There would be no way to buy 100 million worth of bitcoin without moving the market directly or inderectly. You buy on exchanges bitcoin goes to the moon. If you buy off exchanges those bitcoin bought never make it to exchanges which depletes incoming supply onto exchanges. Either way I'm happy to let them give it a go.

This  has been coming for a long time. Makes you wonder why bitcoin companies haven't had teams implanted inside Greece holding town hall meetings with the citizens for months explaining how to use bitcoin. This is a prime example how lack of marketing has failed at adoption. This should have been in place months to a year ago! Send some fucking representatives from your company and start educating the godamn people already! This should never have been allowed by the community to have the Greek people running around like a chicken with their heads cut off trying to retrieve their money from the banks. This should have been nipped in the bud when the warning signs were there. I just hope bitcoin companies learn from their inadequate performance on this situation and correct it for the next crisis.

Many people became rich on paper but lost it all on MtGox. I'd guess only a handful of people bought for pennies and held thru the run up although they probably had thousands of coins.  A lot were wiped out or forgotten about before bitcoin became a thing. Check bitcointalk.org at the very beginning of its existence and you'll get a read on how many people were in it at such low levels. It still kills me reading about them bragging about selling 800 coins for 7.50 8 dollars and making like a hundred dollars profit. If we all only knew then what we know now!

@_date: 2015-06-12 13:34:39
The bitcoin price should theoretically rise under any circumstance due to the fact there's a limited supply and 7 billion people on earth with growing adoption. It could rise faster or slower if the stock market dropped no one really knows.

Bitcoin advertising has been in the toilet since bitcoins inception. Besides BitPay with the Bitbowl we haven't seen jack shit from the major players. Coinbase and Circle need to step to the plate and use some of that venture capital investment Into marketing. Who runs a company and doesn't advertise? That's just dumb and poor managment! There are plenty of inexpensive ways to market without breaking the bank. If my local drivers ed school can sponsor the traffic and weather report every 30 min for the last 10 years we can see some kind of marketing from a company with over 100 million in funding!

Price manipulation and lack of advertising are why we're not moving anywhere. The manipulation only hurts bitcoin for what? A couple hundred bucks profit. Greed is a horrible trait. Lack of marketing only hurts bitcoin because it doesn't counter the negative stereotypes surrounding bitcoin. It takes a second to form an opinion but a lifetime to change.
All these other technical reasons people give are not accurate. Demand is rising slowly around the world but manipulation is stifling prices.

I still believe the majority still haven't heard of bitcoin. I spoke to two different people on Friday asked if they've heard of bitcoin. Neither have. That's the same reaction I've gotten the last few hundred times I've asked someone. Unless you're in the circle or watch Bloomberg, Fox News or CNBC which the majority of the population doesn't then most likely more than half the population still knows nothing of it. We're still in the 2nd inning of the ball game here.
That being said the ones who've heard of it and hate it without understanding it I think jealousy like others have stated plays a big part of it. That and the majority of Americans are ignorant and unwilling to learn new things. We've become a lazy and uneducated country with no Interest to do our own research.

How about a Brazilian average Joe I know that now sends money back home to family using bitcoin once I told him about it. I hate to break it to you but us 300-350 million Americans aren't the average joes. We're the minority in the world. The 3.5 billion unbanked are the average joes!
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:40:18
The problem is it takes forever for the average person to understand bitcoin then forever to learn how and where to buy them and then that's where the education ends. No one explains how to set up a hot wallet on your phone and send or buy things with bitcoin. This leaves millions of people sitting on bitcoin hoping to just get rich because they don't know what else to do with them. This is why education needs to be focused on how to spend them. There's no reason in the world bitcoin shouldn't be being spent. The deflationary theory is ludicrous. If I want to buy something with bitcoin I spend then buy back immediately what I just spent. Like I said once people have them they have no clue what to do with them.

Bitcoin has definitely picked up a few more adopters over this Greece situation. It may not be the millions were all hoping for but it's definitely a few. Exchanges are reporting increases in sign ups from Greece and now there's a big push to give all Greeks free trading. A littlel to late to start marketing to them but better late than never. Just imagine if exchanges had actually prepared for this scenario in advance. I hope they learn from this and become proactive before the next crisis in another country.

The reason its falling is because theres no marketing. When was the last time you saw a product succeed without marketing? Never! No one knows what a bitcoin is or thinks its a scam. Why arent Coinbase and Circle doing tv commercials? Bitcoiners rely to much on word of mouth education which doesnt work because half the time we cant explain what it is or how it works properly.  The big timers need to stop talking at bitcoin seminars and hit the pavement on Main St billboards local tv commercials newspaper Interviews thats the only way well succeed. Other than that we will fail. Lots of great ideas have failed in history. Marketing is everything. Thats why companies dedicate millions of dollars towards it.

I personally think this debate isn't as big as one might think. I think paid trolls are encouraged to voice outrage against a block size increase in order to create chaos. Once the fork is put in place I'm confident the powers that make the decision to either follow the fork or ignore it will choose to follow. It's in everyone's best interest to scale it right down to the almighty Satoshi who said it will need to be scaled in the future.

What you fail to remember is Coinbase has 1.8 million users the majority of which I bet hold their coins in their wallet. Coinbase hasn't said how many coins they're in control of but I'd imagine a couple million. That being said the "am I rich" list would only account for Coinbases wallet not each individual customers meaning many more people own more than 1 coin than what you see. Then there are many other wallet services around the world including exchanges. Many exchanges cold wallets are on that list that have thousands of coins in them but they belong to many people around the world.

The price drop from 1200 to 450 wasnt large enough? It may drop some more but enough people know about bitcoin now that when it reaches a certain level it will shoot back up. The price may stay stagnant for awhile but everyday more and more people are getting into bitcoin, eventually the tide has to turn. It only makes sense cause theres only 12.6 million coins on the market.

For starters the big boys in bitcoin need to not only speak at bitcoin conventions where 95% of the attendees already own bitcoin but also to Main St America where the average joe knows nothing about it.

The tide is turning. More and more people are thinking bitcoin is done which only means one thing....a substantial increase in price soon.

while i agree people will be scared to buy into a sinking ship those same people were scared to buy at a price so high. the price will get low enough where money will pour in Once again and drive the price up. more good news will eventually start rolling in and things will get better.

There are12.8 million coins in existence. Every single one is potentially available to the market yet the price is at 600. And keep in mind even if they go at auction for 1000 each theyre still getting them cheaper than if they were to buy 29k on the open market. I see them going for higher than market value because like i said theres no way they could buy that many now on the open market.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:01:19
Im not seeing the problem with this auction. If anything the goverment selling them is a good thing. First off these coins everybody knows already exists so the fact their moving should make no difference. Second the market price should be readjusting itself upwards based on the news of the auction not downwards. What would be the price today if someone bought up 29k coins right this minute? A lot higher than 600 thats for sure so the market should look at this as 29k coins being snatched up. Finally the goverment auctioning them off adds legitimacy to bitcoin basically inplying they will not be banning them. To auction them off then declare them illegal is even below our goverments standards. The market will sonn see all this and im expecting a huge increase in price the next 2 weeks.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:36:43
Huh? Go back and look at the last months worth of posts on r/bitcoin. Losing coins over not having 2factor enabled verses lost passwords is a 10/1 ratio. Stop pretending like 2 factor isn't the most godamn important thing in bitcoin because it is. And Gox happened back in february, I said lately!
Edit: sorry I don't know where I came up with the exchange getting hacked thought. I could swear that's what u said. If not, my bad. But I stand by my point losing a password is far more rare than getting account hacked due to no 2factor.

if i were to buh more than 1 and have the difference pending for 5 days i believe that opens us up for high risk rejections emails.

The US volume has declined dramtically but china volume has stayed the same. Maybe people are spending their coins so coinbase needs to buy less on the open market. 
I dont understand how these bitcoin indexes come up with a fair market value when they dont calculate many of the currencies worldwide. All i read about is Argentina this Argentina that yet nobody figures their volume or price into the indexes.

while telling people dont risk more than your willing to lose is good advice the way you tell it to people you make yourself sound like a cold heartless asshole. in this day and age with the way the economy is if it didnt hurt people to lose What they put in there wouldnt be any investors. i can afford to lose 1 thousand even 100k but if i did lose it your bet your ass id be upset and pissed the fuck off. Its not a matter of does it hurt to lose it cause unless your bill gates any amount  hurts to lose. stop being a dick and show some compassion!

Then maybe you should stop coming to r/bitcoin for your bitcoin info. There are lots of big things happening behind the scenes building the infrastructure from the ground up. Lots of very smart people in bitcoin not just to the moon people. Its idiotic to sit there and say that someone who bought bitcoin and has seen their money grow by great leangths over the course of a year shouldnt be excited goes to show that a lot of bitcoin bashing is due to jealousy. Grow the fuck up.

No more copy and pasting bitcoin addresses.

Blame Coinbase, Bitpay, and the all talk no action Circle for this one. Besides the bitcoin bowl from Bitpay we haven't seen a shread of advertising from any of the major players in bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-08-10 02:47:49
Do these businesses not have any employees? Every buisness that begins accepting has employees getting introduced to bitcoin for the first time. I agree it would be awsome if every buisness that accepted them would at least retain the 2-3% they would pay in fees in bitcoin and I think we as consumers have a right to only spend our coins with those retailers who openly state they retain a portion. But back to my origional point the world is a big place. I talk to many people everyday who still have not even heard of bitcoin so what better way for people to be exposed to it than to learn on the job your company now accepts it.

Some days im very bullish and some days im very bearish. More bearish lately than bullish. I find myself who once loved the chinese cussing at them under my breath thinking to myself if it had not been for their goverment back in december we'd already be over 3k. But Ive still been buying faithfully every week with whatever spare cash I have. 
Keep the faith, after the crash last april i kept buying every week thru the summer and fall, had my doubts the whole way wondering if i was just throwing money away but stayed persistent with my buying and was rewarded in november. I see the same pattern here and thats what keeps me investing now.

I will likely co tinue to use Coinbase in the future and not Circle just for the simple reason Coinbase was the rock company when others went to shit.

I believe him cause I just bought a house and asked my mortgage broker about bitcoin holdings. I told him I had some on coinbase and the majority in paper wallets in a safety deposit box. He said I could use what I had in coinbase as asset but not the paper wallets. I chose in the end to submit neither. Fuck the banks they stopped just shy of requiring I give them my penis size as far as financials were concerned.

First of all Coinbase was the rock of the bitcoin industry when we were in turmoil due to Mt Gox. Second of all Coinbases talent is second to none not to mention every female they have working for them is smoking hot! Third of all the 40 cents you guys probably save by buying thru Circle (cause lets face it people like to pretend their big ballers when in actuality your most likely buying 40-50 dollars worth at a time) shows what kind of loyalty you have towards a company whos done things right by the community and continues knocking the ball out of the park!

Isnt coinbases transactions off the blockchain? Consumer using coinbase as their wallet spends them with merchant then coinbase recieve from merchant and sell to customer.

They should just start teaching this in the school curriculum like they do units of measurement. Start them young.

0.0001 BTC = 100 microbits
0.00001 BTC = 10 microbits
0.000001 BTC = 1 microbit

What's your stocks potential? Could it ever hit astronomical levels? I find stocks pretty boring now myself. Big deal my stock went up 10 cents today. Last year bitcoin was going up 100 dollars a day. You take the good with the bad. If your a wuss sell your bits and buy stock if you have some balls keep the bits. Four to 5 bitcoin isn't exactly an amount to have to ponder for hours on what to do. Not to mention 15% on roughly 15-1600 dollars isn't something to jump for joy on.

someone just wrote in another thread, sorry for not giving credit to the op of that post i cant remember which thread it was and to lazy to go digging, but that coinbase has a feature that lets a user know by typing in the email address if that email address belongs to a customer of coinbase and sends u back the real name of that user. why they would have that feature not sure but nnetheless this would explain whats going on. there was obviously a leak from another site probably gox or bitcointalk of all the email addresses and the person matched those emails up with the feature as described on coinbase. 
AGAIN THERE WAS NO LEAK ON COINBASE!

Doesnt it sound like a joke currency when you spend 100k bits on a soda? Id much rather see it move to millibits and pay 3 bits for a soda. I like doge and own a few myself but ita still considered a joke currency when people are sending 1000 doge and its not even 4 cents. I think people will look at 100k bits for a soda as to inflationary of a currency when in actuality its the opposite.

I get excited when the price drops because I buy more. Every time the price has fallen you have to determine what caused the price drop. If it wasn't anything fatal then it's time to buy. So far nothing has been fatal to bitcoin. There isn't anything on this earth at the moment that has more potential than bitcoin. Could it go to zero? Absolutely! Could it go to extremes that none of us have ever seen in our lifetime? Yes it could! That's why I'm a hodler. If it goes to zero yes it will hurt me in the wallet but I knew the risks. Maybe if your so nervous lower your holdings to half of what you have. Idk I've never heard of a person have such a dilemma over such a small investment.

I agree one hundred percent. Were letting the mainstream media advertise for us and what gets peoples attention on MSM? Sex death and crime. MSM only focuses on the negatives because thats what sells. How do we combat that? Ive been pondering that for awhile. Were not a company so we dont have a single entity to fund it. 
Ive asked both the bitcoin foundation amd coinbase to put together a simple 1-2 page Paper in laymens terms not some shit that only a geek could understand of what bitcoin is how its beneficial to the world and where its going along with maybe combatting some of the stereotypes associated with bitcoin and post it up somewhere so us as the public can download it and make copies and pass out to the masses. Nothing as of yet. 
Maybe coinbase should do some TV advertising also.

thanks for the response. well if people buy bitcoins prior to spending them and use the ones just purchased to buy the item then there would be no issues since there would be no increase in value. it would affect people that sell bitcoins for cash but thats a given if you sell for a profit obviously you owe tax on it. if anything all this ruling does is ensure that people top off there accounts prior to spending them.

Reguarding your first point tho it seems that coinbase is no longer buying from bitstamp or at the very least minnimal amounts. So how do we reconcile that volume that coinbase deals in but does not figure into the price equation? As more and more merchants accept bitcoin buying from an exchange will be pointless for Coinbase. Not to mention im sure a good majority who trade on the exchanges buy from coinbase directly and transfer their coins over to trade. So you will not have the buying pressure on exchanges any more, just a few day traders as were seeing the last few weeks with the volume.

i think it will have little impact on bitcoin. people arent going to declare petty purchases nor do i think the IRS will go after people not declaring capital gains on small ticket items. they cant keep up with issues outside the digital currency world let alone go after every tom dick and harry that buys a pizza and doesnt realize capital gains on it. if you plan on buying a big ticket item then just buy bitcoins right before purchase of said item so theres no capital gains.
for merchants this ruling does nothing to change their practices. if they recieve 2 dollars in cash or bitcoin they will declare it as revenue. payment processors are already tallying those transactions up for them so nothing changes there.
miners are probably the most impacted by this tho i still dont understand exactly how hard this will hurt them. 
bottom line os nothing really changes for merchants and consumers. if anything it encourages people to never dip into there cold storage to buy big ticket items basically ensuring a shortage of supply on the market to buy coins to spend.
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:19:37

A falling price does nothing to bring more people in. When was the last time you bought a stock that was once a fortune 500 company right before it filed for bankruptcy?

My source is common sense. While all of the other currencies worldwide are trading at previous normal volume, US volume has declined dramatically while at the same time Coinbases consumer wallets continue to rise at same previous levels. Its no secret Coinbase was the largest volume buyer of bitcoins on bitstamp and all of a sudden volume has dried up while demand has increased.

Consumer wallets and addresses are two different things. You were implying that everytime someone buys bitcoins it was pumping up the number of coinbase wallets when that was misleading. I could sit on coinbase all day and click the new address bhtton and have 1.2 million new addresses in about 3 hrs. Thats why your being downvoted. Unfortunatly theres only a upvote and a downvote button so when someone is wrong they get downvoted. Its happened to me many times. Nothing against you. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:28:21
Yes because once bitcoin gets listed on the bloomberg index and an exchange opens up in the US every major financial institution including JP Morgan will be piling money into bitcoin. 
Think about it. If your a publicly held company you would not be touching bitcoin right now because for starters they wouldnt send millions of dollars over to slovenia or wherever Bitstamp is located with a chance of never seeing their money again and no regulations in place. This will all change this summer or fall hopefully and when that happens you better hope your all in on bitcoin!

I agree with op. A falling price does nothing to draw in new users which inturn would hurt bitpays bottom line leading to a decline in their value not just bitcoins value. Lets face it Coinbase saw exponential growth last year when the price was going up 50-70 a day. They were getting new signups to the tune of 10k every 2 days. Once the bubble burst their sign up bubble bursted also.  More customers more value to your company, not rocket science.

personally i think a buisness should cash out immediatley except for the 2-3% credit card fees they are saving on. why not keep those percentages in the system to invest them. of it goes down big deal they wouldnt have had it anyway had the person used a credit card and if it goes up then they just hit the jackpot.
 think of the millions and millions of buisnesses in 5 years that are all retaining that 2-3% that would normally go to credit card fees and then watch the shortage of coins on the market with a big price increase.

I used to think we needed consumer adoption before merchant adoption for bitcoin to take off until i realized that every merchant that decides to accept bitcoin has employees that get exposed to it for the first time who then im sure a percentage become future bitcoiners. Everybody in the world works for someone so when their employers start accepting them most likely these employees arw being taught about the benefits of bitcoin.

This is actually false. They have made numerous claims that only their coins they hold in their hot wallets are fully insured which equates to roughly 2% -3% of all coins they hold because they keep 97-98% in cold storage. So pray they don't suffer a deep cold storage hack/theft.

You mean buy them and hold them for at least 24 hrs longer than you hold yours? The only way for us not to be worried about cojns being dumped on the market would be mass consumer adoption which seems to be slowing down. Im in the group that believes consumer adoption should come before merchant adoption. Unfortunately it seems to be the other wah around. Get out educate the public about bitcoin, reverse the stereotypes put out by the media. Thats the only way we will win in the end.

The price is being manipulated by a few big players. The average person isn't sending money overseas to a shady exchange and paying wire transfer fees to buy 100 dollars in bitcoin. We will continue to see a downtrend until an exchange opens up in the US. Unfortunately exchanges are the only way to determine what the price should be but I think it's unfair to have the price be determined by a handful of traders.

The guy from twitter said it would blow our minds. Changetip on Facebook was already known to be going live soon and Coinbase already told us Uber would be one of the next big companies to accept them so not really mind blowing news the 2 I mentioned unless Facebook went the extra mile and actually bought changetip. That's my theory I guess we'll wait and see what if anything transpires today.

If there's no laws or licenses in practice how the helll are they supposed to be licensed? Coinbase has a very good compliance team and I'm quite sure they dotted their I's and crossed their T's knowing they were legally allowed to open the exchange without the incoming bit licenses in hand. Their claim was they are the first regulated exchange and under current regulations they must feel they comply.

But yes it took the longest of any period of time to hit the next milestone at about a month and a half. Bitcoin will die a slow death if the biggest player in the space Coinbase refuses to do any kind of advertising or marketing.

One has to realize that the protocol of bitcoin is still intact and it hasn't become illegal in the US. If one of those things happened I'd be very upset and selling everything. The market is small and manipulated by no more than a few hundred big players possibly entities that would like to see bitcoin die. I agree people that come on here and say price doesn't matter are annoying as fucking hell because price does matter. But until one of those two things I mentioned above there's really not much to be worried about. Eventually the price will reach a low where the majority think is cheap and the buying will be back. Even the people trying to kill bitcoin wouldn't pass up making money when the price hits a certain point. Don't panic relax take a breath. The tide will turn. And if It doesn't so be it were all out a lot of money. I'd gladly trade all my bits to get my health back since I was diagnosed with  rare blood disorder 2 years ago.

the deflationary argument holds no water. bitcoiners have shown time and time again they would spend there coins if given a reason. Also why is it so hard to grasp the concept of spending your coins and then replenishing your account with more coins. if your gona buy a tv buy it in coins and use the worthless fiat to buy more coins. Its not rocket science.
this is What makes bitcoin the future. if u sit on cash you lose money so you spend with bitcoin you can spend it AND sit on it and make money.  It doesnt have to be one or the other.

Instead of holding the coins till one day possibly paying off our nations debt they would rather take the quick buck. Eighteen million dollars is a drop in the bucket to our goverment.

Keep blaming miners. While the rest of the world will blame market manipulators. Miners would not all dump their coins at the same time and cause a crash. They would want to sell them off gradually.

Do you really think Coinbase will start advertising? They've been in business 2.5 years and haven't advertised yet.

There's only about 5 million people out of 7 billion that own bitcoin and only 100k business worldwide that accept it. Shoot I've been trying to spend bitcoin locally but I'm not driving an hour to the nearest restaurant to do so nor do I need legal immigration advice which is 30 min away. Lack of merchants and lack of education on the consumer side as to how to spend bitcoin. I know 10 people who own bitcoin none have a clue on what to do with them but let them sit there. Free local workshops from Coinbase and Circle would go a long friggen way to begin educating the public on what to do once you own bitcoin!

I have the solution.....set up a toll free number where people can call in for the last price they sold for. Average them all out once an hour and there's your fair market value. Who wants to volunteer to answer phones?
But seriously these exchanges suck. Not sure I understand how a global currency is dictated by maybe 500 traders if that with large sums of coins worldwide. I live in the states and wouldn't dare send money overseas to these exchanges not to mention wire fees to send 100 dollars. I buy thru coinbase who gets there coins from the merchants or from miners and I bet 75% of bitcoiners do the same thing. We won't see a real fair market value until regulators in the states get off their fat asses and put laws in place for an exchange to open here legally.

I don't have a computer science degree and I'm into bitcoin nor are the 7 people I got into bitcoin. The fact that it's not ready for mainstream use is hogwash. We'd be in a lot better shape right now if half the population owned bitcoin and we're waiting on places to spend them than the way we're going now. Bitcoins not rocket science and I'm not a rocket scientist. If I can figure it out anyone can. The word isn't reaching the masses. And by the word I mean marketing by the big players in bitcoin not MSM. These bitcoin conferences that the big players go to speak at for 300 dollars a ticket are absolutely useless.

A couple of greedy fucks would rather dump on the market for a few thousand dollars profit and jeopardize the whole network than sit tight hold and allow for everyone to make money and if anyone thinks it's anybody other than people wanting to see the demise of bitcoin dumping on the markets then you're all gullable. Early adopters and or miners would not dump thousands of bitcoin on the market at once causing themselves to leave money on the table due to slippage. There's obviously an ulterior motive for these massive dumps and my money is on the people who have everything to gain by people losing confidence in the market.

The seller on ebay is partnered with Satoshi labs and the package comes in a box sealed with tape and inside the box is the trezor inside a smaller box sealed with thick plastic and security seals. It would be almost impossible for it to have been tampered with unless they have a packing facility identical to the trezor company so to answer your question yes it is safe. In fact the only way to open it was to tear the box open.

There are vast amounts of untapped parts of the world far far away from these negative mainstream media articles such as the US News article out today. I'm betting on those parts of the world to embrace bitcoin, why? Because it's better than what exists there already. Bitcoin doesn't have to succeed in the US for it to become big. The US makes up 350 million of the 7 billion people world wide. Not to say it's doing poorly here in the US because it's not its doing quite well but the US isn't the end all with bitcoin.

I think lawnmower is a killer app. It adds all the spare change in the world into bitcoin that would normally get lost or spent or sit in a big water cooler for years until one day you need a dolly to lug it to the bank to cash it in after losing 3% a year due to inflation.

This is the problem with Coinbase. They have you partially verify when a person signs up the person buys their buy gets cancelled and being a passive bitcoiner who's not technically save they receive an email saying their buy was cancelled and they don't know why and they don't log back on to find out. Coinbase loses a customer and we lose a new bitcoin user. I know 5 people who this has happened to and at the moment still don't own any tho all would have been repeat buyers had that first purchase gone thru and if I know 5 then the numbers of people who've had this scenario happen to them must be staggering.

I don't think you can make any assumptions on what the price will do if compared to litecoins halving. First off there are very few litecoiners out there. That was definitely a pump and dump though it did settle higher. Bitcoins halving is a completely different animal. Thousands around the world are entering bitcoin on a daily basis. The price could stay flat pump and settle at 800 or it may never stop rising. It's going to be one exciting fucking year that's for sure either way. Just thought I'd mention litecoin halving because I've seen many people refer to that as what will happen with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:38:30
Buy now. If it falls buy more to lower your average.
@_date: 2016-06-04 19:59:56
All the bitcoin in existence multiplied by the price and there's your marketcap. A higher marketcap for bitcoin generally means a higher price though the price can stay flat and marketcap will still rise due to new coins being mined.

No offense but a rep from the exchange that caused today's sell off is hardly trustworthy. Instead of spending your time arguing with me maybe you should work on keeping your exchange up and running. But I'll play this game for a sec. People inside your exchange who do have access to the backend should be barred from trading on said exchange.

Actually fee free trading and fake volume stifled the price of bitcoin. What incentive did the Chinese have to let price rise naturally when they were doing wash trades to themselves to get their withdrawal fees waived. They were also able to make tremendous profit on 1 cent moves keeping prices in a  tight range and unable to move naturally. This is great news for bitcoin and longterm it will show. In fact Bobby Lee agreed with me on this a few years ago but said fee free trading was not going anywhere because all of China were doing it.
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:27:00
What I'm saying is the writing was on the wall when their CEO said he trades on his own site and sees no conflict of interest. That's a big red flag. It was a huge story about 9 months ago. Yet people still use them like they did Mt Gox.

No one knows what the price will do. After halving price could fall or could never stop rising. If we all knew the future we'd all be rich before bitcoin. Buy now if you're going to buy. A few dollars either way isn't going to make you or break you.

Phil G. Potter is a major stakeholder of Bitfinex and has administrative access to the backend platform including direct access to the database and is often present on a teamspeak voice channel where around 200 trader chat and share trading analysis.
Yesterday he was asked if he trades on his own platform Bitfinex, to which he replied yes. He was then grilled "don't you think that is a conflict of interests because you have special access to the platform?" - that is, he can see things normal traders cannot, like hidden orders, the size of everyone's accounts, the open margin positions of accounts, exact trading activity of each user, how much USD is flowing into and out of the exchange (he would have the competitive advantage of knowing when big players are feeling bullish). All of this gives a huge competitive advantage. After this questions, he tried to back-pedal but made it worse by trying to justify it by saying because he is an early adopter (meaning he has a lot of coins and qualifies as a whale) he "only trades a little bit here and there".
Edit: He is not the CEO

On June 2nd they hit 3.9 million so it took roughly 19 days to get another 100 thousand users. Much faster than the previous average of nearly 30 days. Don't know if these are new ethereum sign ups or bitcoin sign ups. Probably a combination of both.

I've used Coinbase for awhile and think they're great to an extent. I've run into a few minor hiccups with them canceling automatic buy orders or freezing my buys all together until I log on and update more info which for someone like me isn't to difficult to fix the situation but for someone who doesn't really understand what they're doing a buying freeze on a account would petty much end that users experience with bitcoin..I know a girl who signed up made a purchase, that purchase was canceled because they needed more info and she has yet to go back and update. I'm sure we've lost millions of passive bitcoiners due to these kind of issues.

If it breaks it's all time high it can fly away unscathed indefinitely or until next resistance level of possibly 2000 but more like 5000. The ATH is really our last real resistance level so I disagree with your assessment it will crash. Keep in mind 2013 it multiplied 52x. Sure it was artificial but the infrastructure is much more grand now than back then. A 25% rise would be peanuts and no cause for a crash.

Can you explain why you're not actively marketing your company? I would think grabbing a lionshare of the market before Gemini comes on line would be a great strategy. As of right now you're begging for another company to take your market share from you.

What if it's not a toaster but something like a car. Think of how that would change the world. Fleet trucks long haul truckers commuters that commute an hour each way to work all mining bitcoin while they're in operation. Never have to pay a car note again the car could automatically send payment to the bank. Never have to swipe your card at the gas pump cause you could just pump and the car send payment to gas company. Never having to re register your car your car would send payment directly to DMV. That's what excites me. It may sound unrealistic now but I find it hard to believe that this could never be. What happens to the price of bitcoin when you now have a half a billion new people in the ecosystem and a whole segment of the economy running on bitcoin? You get an obscene price increase that you hear thrown around all the time!

How do you figure a visitor is a wallet? I think you're the one confused. Their user numbers have been stagnant since the beginning of the year only generating about 500k new users this year. Meanwhile their wallet numbers are jumping like crazy. And since wallet numbers are a pointless indicator of growth it's irrelevant. They've also only acquired 3 to maybe 5 thousand new merchants this year. Not the kind of growth we want in a market where 99.9% of the worlds population own no bitcoin yet.
Not sure why people are up voting your misinformation.

Are you doing any kind of marketing there in Greece? If so could you explain to Coinbase what you're doing so maybe they could do some marketing here in the states?

Not if you're a new customer. If you've been a customer for at least 2-3 months with some buys under your belt you can email support and ask for a limit increase. They will probably bump you up 100. They said every 3 months to write them back and request an increase.

I got into bitcoin in 2011. Never mined wish I had. I'm more a saver and less of a spender tho I have spent and will continue to in the future. I'm like a squirrel tho saving those nuts for a cold winter day. I look at bitcoin as potentially saving my families financial future when the current economy collapses around us.

Actually Coinbase is not 0 fee nor is Circle since they have a mark up on price. Both have received tens of millions of dollars in funding yet we see zero ads.

Actually bitcoin adoption on Coinbase has become stagnant. February they hit 2 million and a half year later after opening in 24 more countries they've only managed to gain 400k more users. I'd say a 30-35% increase year over year in an untapped market which is most likely what they'll do in 2015 is pretty crappy.

I don't think that's a bad thing at all. But in this situation if you're talking about a few hundred dollars I would say Coinbases vault option is as secure as can be with a 3rd party. They also have an option where you hold the private keys.

I disagree. People in the states are growing more and more tired of rising food, energy and general living costs. They were not happy with the bailout of banks in 2008. I read somewhere public opinion of banks and bankers are at there lowest percentages ever. I think we need to play on that notion that no banker in the world goes to bed at night wondering how to help the 99%. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:56:57
Thanks for doing the legwork. Now look at 2014 and you'll see a sharp decline year over year. Not something you want to see when 99.9% of the world's population owns no bitcoin.

Thanks for the read. I'm at work so I made sure I read it all lol. Personally I think it's impossible to keep track of your bitcoin spending if you spend numerous times. I think it's an unrealistic request by the IRS who may I add can't even keep track of where their emails went let alone an average Joe remembering exactly when and where a bitcoin purchase was made at what price and keep in mind people aren't dealing in full bitcoin they're dealing with fractions so if I'm buying a cup of coffee for 3 dollars and I have to figure out how much capital gains I spent on .0002 bitcoin when I bought .39 bitcoin at 274 they're out of their fucking minds!

I happen to agree with you but unlike you am taking no pleasure in admitting it. Imagine how many more users and how much more adoption could be if they just did a little marketing. But obviously they don't care to grow their buisness.
Anyone denying there's a problem when the largest company in the space increased users by 90% in late 2013 thru 2014 and will have a hard time breaking 30% in 2015 while expanding into 24 more countries need to wake the fuck up!

They should give you an option to have 2 small deposits deposited into your account for you to verify. If you don't see that option and don't feel comfortable giving your account password email support they'll direct you on how to do the deposits.

Why couldn't it be a combination of all 3? The chinese pushed it up to 1200 in 2013, if its the Chinese now why has it only risen 20+ dollars? I'm sure there are Greeks that got their money out and are putting it in bitcoin. Surely not the crazy hype mania that's being portrayed but def not zero like you make it sound. A twenty plus dollar increase is nothing compared to Cyprus 2013.

It's not like the price is going up hundreds a day here. It's only up 20 dollars in 2 weeks. The way you make it sound is the price has multiplied 3x and theres no way it's due to the Greeks. Twenty dollars of course it could be from the Greeks. It doesn't take much to move the market especially when there's low volume.

This is a step in the right direction tho I fear it will just trigger a lot of bogus accounts that will drain Coinbase of money. I'd much rather see free local workshops held around the country educating Main St on bitcoin or at the very least some advertising on billboards at bus and train stations. The word Coinbase needs to be implanted in people's minds before they're willing to link a checking account to an unknown company. Hopefully this is the first roll out of many bigger things on the marketing front.

They use coinbase which is probably a lot safer than most other methods for beginners. When she starts accumulating larger amounts then start to consider alternative security methods. I think you may be over thinking it to much.

So you're saying all 7.5 billion people on earth already heard of bitcoin? There's only roughly 25-30 million people who own crypto half being Coinbase customers and the other half I'll generously give to China. I really don't think only 30 million on earth want to own bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:51:32
This might be a stupid question but with China banning bitcoin would this be a good opportunity for Trump to go ahead and back the US dollar with bitcoin effectively claiming bitcoin as our own?

What's sstopping them same criminals from just targeting wealthy people and demanding bitcoins? For the most part most bitcoin holders at this point are not wealthy. They'd have much better odds targeting wealthy people  and making them figure out how to buy and send bitcoin.

It can just as easily he held or hodl. Nothing wrong with hodl and when an opportunity arises spend it.

A company with a big bark and very little bite. They were supposed to transform the financial world. So far they've done nothing but offer you a way to buy bitcoin. Haven't heard a peep from them since they launched. They're obviously taking Coinbases marketing approach which is do nothing and stagnate for years.
@_date: 2015-04-09 10:07:37

How about take it a step further and have every vehicle on earth mine bitcoin while running. Long haul truckers will then make money while making money. Fleet trucks for thousands of companies World Wide will be making money while out making money. Normal people who commute to work will now be making money while traveling to go make money. Imagine going to a car dealership and driving off the lot never having to worry about making a car payment because the car you're driving automatically generates it's own income and sends bank payment on the first of every month. Never having to pay for registration because your car already paid the registration fee to DMV, car insurance paid on time every month directly from what your car generates in bits. Or pulling into a gas station pumping your gas and getting back in not having to worry about paying for you gas because your car automatically sent payment to the gas station. This world is going to change in a big way and I'm glad I'm along for the ride!
That's the fucking killer app for bitcoin that no other money or commodity can touch! It can pay itself off for things you buy. What it does is it forces society Into bitcoin. Similar to how if you still used a pager today you'd look like a fool. This is what he was talking about his product at 21 taking bitcoin mainstream.

If they're unknown to the real world how would they verify with any police department?  It doesn't make sense. I used them a little more than a year ago to buy some litecoin.

I feel Coinbase is a good gauge of user adoption and the days between each new 100k users keeps stretching further and further apart. It went from every 9-12 days 15 months ago to this last update 10 days short of 2 months. They also signed up almost 1 million new users last year. This year they're on pace for 550-600k. Big drop off from a market leader in an untapped market

Wait the 30 day grace period and you'll be instant buy on coinbase. It's not the end of the world. You waited your whole life to buy bitcoins 30 more days won't kill you. Plus be happy that 30 day grace period is there because it looks like we're in another downtrend so you'll end up getting more for your money. You know volatility works both ways. Sometimes you win sometimes you lose. In the long run let's hope there's more winners than losers.

I'm with you. Don't know why all the down votes. We have a real problem on our hands. I've gotten 10 people into bitcoin all when the price was rising or around 600. I had 3 more on the ropes but now want nothing to do with bitcoin because of the falling price. 
There's no marketing no educational material nothing! Who heard about bitcoin for the first time and says yes let me turn my 100 dollars into 50 almost overnight.  Like I said in a thread I made a last week this community is running around like a chicken with our heads cut off. There's no organization. If we were a company we would have been out of business a long time ago. Things need to change and quick. And enough with the price don't matter bullshit.

Thanks for answering. So say if all 1 billion were divided into multiple pools it's likely they would win said lottery if even a fraction of a bit. So in order for it to be cost effective price would need to be orders of magnitudes higher am I correct? But if a billion new people join the mining pools that's a billion new people in the bitcoin atmosphere which would make that happen. It's like solving the chicken or egg problem. Cause I think I have the answer to that 2k year old question. Just trying to gather as much info as possible here.

So say you were not a very nice person and bought bitcoin from them and received instantly yet they don't receive the money from the banks for 3-5days there'd be nothing stopping you from sending those coins out of Coinbase and canceling the bank account or not even have the money to pay for them. No business would stay in business if every one scammed them and in fact a few shut down for those exact reasons tho I believe they were  credit card scams. It's not about being distrustful it's about not losing your business to scammers. I don't think you would lend cash out to strangers without full identity and verifications they are who they say they are and can repay you back.
Very simple way to buy instant is make a small purchase from them link a credit card to your account then wait the 30 day grace period u til they give you instant access up to 1000 dollars a week I believe.

My question was a sincere one. I still have no clue how lightning works. I'm lucky I understand the gist of bitcoin after many thousands of hours of reading it and researching it. Seven years in its still to complicated for the unmotivated. Will this all be dumbed down for the unmotivated?

They live in a 3rd world country and most likely will never move to a first world country therefore the ones who adopt bitcoin will become the new wealthy elite in their respective countries. The ones who don't will remain at the bottom of the chain. I also suspect these same people will surpass a lot of first world people who didn't adopt bitcoin.

Besides their stubbornness to hire a marketing team Coinbase is a great company. The complaints you hear here about their rules and regulations have nothing to do with them. Their hands are tied on that front. 
They have some great talent working for them and they've done more for the advancement of bitcoin than everyone here bitching about them combined.

They should be working on what no other money can do but bitcoin can. Pay you back for things you buy virtually making every purchase being free in the long run. Bitcoin is money anybody can generate not just government therefore why shouldn't it be generated while you buy/own things. Take what you want from my statement but I think 21 Inc is working on this solution that will transform the world's economy overnight. Businesses don't just get 116 million in funding in one single round unless their idea is going to change the world if it materializes.

It jumped like 13 dollars in a matter of minutes. It's obvious it's a single buyer who purchased a large amount. Jumps like these usually don't hold and fall back down. I'd rather see a slow steady increase then one large increase. Americans can never hold or continue a rally out of Gina.

I brought this up to the bitcoin foundation over a year ago. They don't care.

So I buy bitcoin at a 1% surcharge and pay for my car insurance and get no rewards back using this card? I'm not big on credit cards but it seems to me like 1% cash back using my discover card beats paying 1% to use this card. My mom nor anyone else I know hates the banks that much where they will give up free cashback and pay to use instead. We need perks and we need them now! Grant it you have to start somewhere but just doesn't seem like a game changer at all as of yet.

May I suggest you contact them because I've asked for numerous exchanges to be listed there and none have made the cut. They like speaking directly to the CEOs.

He should have verified a credit card then purchase the instant limit of 100 per day/week forgot which it is then there'd be no issues. The credit card verification is key here. It enables instant purchase of a small amount until you reach 30 days after first purchase then limits are raised. 
Coinbase should make this their policy and not allow people to buy over a limit on credit until their 30 days is up. To many stories like this. 
Anyways have your father In law wait a few more days till the credit card is verified and then like I said buy only up to the limit. I've done it this way for 6 people and none have had a problem.

I had a similar problem and it turned out it wasn't a defective Trezor. It took my like 3 hrs to figure out but I finally found out my computer had to be manually updated in the control panel to recognize a new USB device. Once I did that the computer recognized the Trezor immediately. Sorry wish I could go into detail what to do but I don't remember enough to be able to guide you properly. I actually had to Google the process step by step. Maybe someone with more technical experience could guide you step by step through it.

Coinbase has amassed quite a compliance team with highly reguarded resumes. I'm not worried in the slightest. If they opened in states without licensing since I've yet to hear of a state with licensing in place I'm sure it's because they got the permission to do so and have proof to prove it come crunch time or they'd be operating lunar exchange in all 52 states if they didnt. They have what they need to operate in the states they're in as of now.

Other than their customer service and their switch to ethereum I have no real issues with them but find myself buying from Circle more and more. Every purchase that leaves Coinbase and goes somewhere else is money out of their pocket. I hope they wake up and hire a full time customer service team with skills of knowing the customer is their reason for existence.

Every person on earth should be a target audience to market towards. How will they pay for it? Idk they just received 75 million dollars. Marketing is a very powerful tool for any brand or product. Or we can just continue to let mainstream media taint the general publics perception of bitcoin until there's no more hope. The flyer idea would cost them roughly an hours pay to one of their employees to put together and post on their site. The fact that this hasn't been done yet in over 2 years of operation boggles my mind.

1. I have actually heard of you but admit never researched.
2. Just checked out your site it's very sleek and easy for a beginner to navigate.
3. N/A due to the fact I haven't used the site yet. Will make it a point to use bitquick.co on my next bitcoin purchase to try it out. But here's a little tip for you. Advertise the hell out of your company because the big players namely Coinbase does absolutely no marketing and it's showing in their stagnating user growth. Keep pounding bitquick.co into every persons head until they get tired of hearing the name. That's how you become a household name.

The 4.7% was not a transaction fee it was most likely because the value of bitcoin fell. Circles support I found last week to be on par with Coinbase. They respond fairly quickly and quite friendly. 
The good thing about doing business with Circle or Coinbase is that if you lost your 2 factor you will most likely gain access to your account again. If it was someone like btc-e you could pretty much kiss your coins goodbye.

This is incorrect they updated to 2 million mid January. I know this because I was expecting 2/15 to be the 3 week mark and was hoping it would hit 2.1 by then.
Edit: Jan 29th was the exact day they hit 2 million. If I could edit my title I would to state 45+ days instead of two months. Nonetheless 45+ days is not exactly what we would call rapid growth when it was happening every 12-14 days.

I don't feel like I need to brag about my successes in life to prove my point with you. You said their marketing strategy is wonderful because they dropped changetip. I say that's bullshit because it does nothing to further adoption. The main point of my post was Coinbase needs to get their name out to the masses. You claim by doing nothing they are doing something. I say they are doing nothing and it shows by their stagnating user numbers. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:00:09
The only people that heard about dropping the tip button were people on reddit and who own bitcoin already. A targeted audience that does nothing for further adoption. Their marketing plan sucks. If it was so good then I'd never see a frosted flakes commercial because Kelloggs wouldn't  need to do commercials they'd follow Coinbases marketing plan.

Thanks for replying to my post Brian. I admire you and what your company has done thus far and if anyone were to look at my post history they would see that I'm a strong proponent of Coinbase.
That being said I like yourself am passionate about bitcoin and want nothing more than for bitcoin to succeed and without some kind marketing I don't see that happening. Every single day there is a negative or ignorant article in the media. You being the market leader with millions of dollars at your disposal need to be the one to combat that. Marketing is a pretty big sector of a company to overlook. At the very least there have been some good suggestions made in this thread that doesnt require a marketing team per se. I hope you begin to focus on that more. 
Anyway this has been eating at me for quite awhile and finally said to myself I'm going to make some noise on this issue. Now I know you that you know what I wanted you to know and I'm glad to find out you DONT have a marketing team because not only does that explain what I've been feeling but I also felt bad for calling them out on doing such a poor job! Haha! 
@_date: 2015-02-06 18:05:53

Listen if marketing wasn't necessary for a brands success there'd be no commercials. We'd have commercial free TV and radio. I don't know about you or your 2 mbtc invested In bitcoin but I have a stake in seeing bitcoin succeed. We can agree to disagree but if you think mainstream media is doing a fabulous job at portraying the benefits of bitcoin to the masses on their own then so be it.

My numbers are direct from their website on the about page. I've been with Coinbase a long time and they were at a point last year of 10k new users every 2-3 days to now 100k every 45-60 days. They doubled in size last year this year they are on pace to increase 25% if their trend continues. Hardly a growth rate we've become accustomed to with them. Bitcoin pulses 30 day growth is not accurate because they only update when Coinbase updates their page and every month it takes a little longer for Coinbase to update their user numbers to the next 100k. 
I used the 3 examples of commercial, magazine and billboard because those are the top 3 ways to advertise. Personally I don't care how they do it but the point is they aren't doing it. Their strategy is to give everyone that signs up 1 dollar in bitcoin. I say that's a lame strategy and if that's the best their team can come up with then we're all going to be broke!

If you want to stay anonymous there are ways to do so outside of a well funded highly scrutinized exchange. People love to complain about Coinbase but if it weren't for them bitcoin would still be 10 dollars each. They're the rock when everyone else was getting hacked and or closing up shop with customers funds and last but not least what godamn company in their right mind would front ten thousand dollars so someone could buy a irreversible currency without having the funds in their possesion?

Like the op said it's good to have some regulated choices. If you want to remain anonymous there are plenty of other options. Fingerprints of employees? Fuck yea why not? If they don't plan on running off with our money no reason not to. Proof of reserves? Haven't we all been asking of that since MTGox? Let's face it the big players aren't coming unless there's a legal on ramp for them to play. The ramp is being built now let's just hope they show up.

It hit 600 for the first time in almost 2 years on June 11th. Just a little more than a month ago. Today its 55 dollars higher than 600. DI'd you really expect the price to be 1 million in a month?

If you're new and not fully verified on Coinbase buys are delayed by 4-5 days. I'd imagine you'll have your coins on Tuesday afternoon with Monday being a holiday.  I would think it would be the same even using a debit card until you're fully verified.

The question I'd like to know is what does 33% increase in monthly sign ups consist of in real numbers. Maybe the CEO could enlighten us. Is it 7 customers to 9.5 to 12 to 16 to 21.5 customers and stands at like 45 customers total today or are we talking 100k customers back in February to 133k in march and so on. That makes a big difference.

I'm sure a fake rolex is still illegal just lesser of the illegal type on there.
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:51:29
I Personally wouldnt have a problem with this but there would be some negatives to this. First the way goverment loves to tax us to death i could see that 1% climbing another 1% every year until they bled us dry. Secondly that would put users of coinbase at a disadvantage over everybody else that buys bitcoins thru other means such as localbitcoins bitstamp mtgox etc. So now that i think bout it id be against it. Although at first glance it sounds like a compromise between the goverment and the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:13:24
You realized that the price was  4 times the amount it was in april correct amd were only day 2 into this sell off hysteria. This is far more disturbing in terms of magnitude than back in april.

Talk about an exchange that could have done big things. Stopped using them almost 2 years ago and never looked back. Always had horrible customer service luckily I never had a problem but followed others problems closely. In the end after some time most if not all of customers issues were finally worked out but could imagine the anxiety people went thru. My question is why would anyone be using them today when their volume is nonexistent?

Place another order if you want to and if your first order gets canceled email support asking for your act to be whitelisted and they will most likely remove your act off the high risk list and Let the next transacrion go thru smooth.

I highly doubt the feds would step in based on customers complaints that there getting flagged as high risk. If you want to play ball with the big guys like coinbase wants to do to stay in buisness then they need to have some kind of system in place to show the goverment there abiding by all laws.

 banks are bannned. People are free to do as they wish. Banks will sever all ties with exchanges. Why would banks Still associate with btcchina when it was just banned from doing so? Will every chinese citizen send in money orders to btcchina to buy bitcoins? We see How well Thats working with the only US exchange campbx. The banks have no benefits to allow transfers into btcchina to begin with so now Why would they continue to do so after this ruling?

No Never. I told her that her Bits could be worthless tomorrow and i made sure She knew i hadnt pushed her into buying anything. I told her the only reasoning i ever mentioned bitcoin to her was because Ive been bursting at the seams to tell somebody about them other than my wife who gets annoyed with me when i talk about em to her. So my mom is well aware that i Never solicited her to get in on it. 
I am extremely shocked Actually that shes so eager to get involved. I also told her to sign up on coinbase and while Waiting to be verified do lots of research on it before sinking her first dollar into it. I said read all of the negative articles as well as the positive ones and make a well informed decision.

Thats impossible because a year and a half ago it was about 5-6 bucks a bit so a 100 bucks wouldve bought you no more than 20. It be worth no more than 6000 today. Sorry but youd have to go back over 2 years to even get the price below 2 bucks.
Oh excuse me i didnt see your reasoning before i posted my commenti but yea we should all be millionaires if we bought at the lowest and sold at the highest.

Was it foolish to buy google when it was 400? Or berkshire hathoway at 40,000? People that took a risk at those prices have made spectacular returns on there money. Bitcoin has just gotten started. But again it could all dissapear tomorrow. Think of it as if your going to the casinò.

Most people are law abiding citizens therefore i have trouble seeing the price going up if they make em illegal to own/use.  The US goverment has alot of pull in other countries so they would drop the iron fist on countries that keep them  who are our so called allies. 
Personally i think they will continue being legali just with heavy regulations  because lets not forget the US goverment is a big holder of bitcoins due to silk road. I just wish theyd mind there own fucking buisness like someone else said everything they touch turns to shit. 
My question is if anybody knows if they do deem them illegal is there any recourse thru the supreme court to overturrn any laws they put in place or is there decision to make em illegal final?
