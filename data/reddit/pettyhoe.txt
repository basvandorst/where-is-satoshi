This week we get James D’Angelo in the studio to explore his new data and stance that miners are in trouble. His math holds up though and we find out the problem with proof of work is that it is completely mistaken. Satoshi made a fundamental mistake and we’re just going to have to get over it. And his mistake was right there in the whitepaper; it says, “one CPU is one vote”. And there’s nobody who is going to deny that one CPU is no longer one vote. What we really have to come to terms with is it’s basically centralized from the very day in 2012 when there was a high number of miners and ASICs came in and mining started to centralize. And it’s centralizing exponentially; we don’t know the numbers but I think almost everyone can feel it. Also, 10 year future predictions! And for all you technophobes out here don’t get confused. This is remarkably simple math, very easy to understand and after listening to this episode you’ll be able to explain this phenomenal new technology to your techie friends.
@_date: 2016-04-19 14:18:16
If I understood him correctly, he really wants a "proof-of-personhood" on the miners.

SuchWow.tv is the quirkiest video channel using PopChest bitcoin micropayments. On episode  we talked in length about the micropayment system but now we wanted to record a show with someone that uses the system itself. Laura Lopez is a genius. She is a Los Angeles-based reality tv editor. She thinks cryptocurrency micropayments are the way forward for content creators and teaches an introductory bitcoin class. Most people are doubtful about bitcoin and its price volatility. But as soon as content creators realize they can win a lot more distributing their creations through bitcoin than with actual models like adsense or amazon, despite the variability of its price, the bitcoin market can explode. Hopefully this is the first step in changing the world of content distribution using bitcoin.

**Interview starts around 21 min if you aren't interested in our banter.**
We wrap up April by discussing the rise of bitcoin’s price, an update on the pending halving event and we invite one of the Co-Founders of Ethereum, Joseph Lubin, to chat with us so you experience a vibrant and seamless view of ConsenSys and its deep understanding of the potential blockchain technologies can bring to the world. It’s a good chat, and it’s one that doesn’t happen often. ConsenSys has emerged from stealth with a network of members worldwide, on a mission of creating decentralized applications (dApps) and various other tools for the emerging decentralized economy that leverages Ethereum and other Blockchain eco-systems. Also, we celebrate a full calendar year rockin’ this podcast shit. Thanks for being there with us and we’ll continue to produce another year (and maybe a year after that).

Now that you've established you feel there's a problem with the semantics, you've missed the point.  We've gotten incredibly far away from the intentional design.

We touched on this topic during the interview.  You can view Provenance as somewhat of a web-of-certification, that verifies data's validity, and is decentralized and tamper-proof.

Caution is always appropriate.  However, I would say that after speaking with him, he knows his shit. If it was a scam, he's dedicated enough to a backstory that he deserves everyone's money. 
No one knows that much for a scam. Pluto's is real, and you only give them your email for now.  And when you actually can use their app, you only need to send bitcoin to am address, and it works. If your scared, send 3 dollars and test it.

You made the broad sweeping generalization, I simply corrected it.  99.9% of middle class Americans probably don't think much about Bitcoin and its benefits, but they don't make up the people who could use the banking services that Bitcoin can off them.  They simply see it as a risky investment option, especially if that is how you present it to them (not saying you are).  The vast majority of people who would find Bitcoin attractive as a transaction network are people you probably don't talk to, unless you talk to impoverished peoples outside of America regularly.
99.9% of middle class Americans are also pretty ignorant to how money actually works, and what is involved with a single transaction.  You may speak to a lot of people, but it is still a small portion of the whole, and the sound of your tone seems to indicate that you speak condescendingly and negatively about the prospects of what something like this can offer, and if you come from a perceived knowledgeable position, of course the people you talk to don't see a benefit.
Furthermore, the transaction services of Bitcoin has been analogized to SMTP and the internet.  I remember a day when people thought email and the internet was dumb and useless, simply because they were too ignorant to understand it.

this takes into account a miner, for instance, which is relevant considering they operate a higher percentage of hashrate, meaning their contribution to the network is higher.

This is great feedback, and I think there is also an aspect of the audience as well.  I know Dee wants to tailor this to a broader audience, so their needs to be an aspect of answering _their_ questions through the vehicle of the conversation with the individual, which is a very difficult thing to do.
I'm excited to see Dee grow in his ability to explain these concepts, and really get the picture through, to a wide range of audience, and feedback like this only helps him get better at it.
Our first podcasts sucked, and I feel as though we've gotten better at it over time, and that because we started, and sucked, and learned lessons. 
He's hit a nerve with this podcast concept, and now it's just a matter of continuing it and continuously getting better.

The [linked paper]( explains a bit more, but not too much.  In the introduction: 


symmetric key is of special interest as a building block for protocols that operate
on top of Bitcoin. For example, a possible idea behind this kind of schemes is to
encrypt data using a symmetric key cryptosystem, release the encrypted data,
and then create a hash locked output where the unlocking value corresponds to
the symmetric key used to encrypt the data. The amount of bitcoins deposited
into that output corresponds to the price that is going to be payed for ability to
decrypt (and thus obtain) the data. In order to collect the bitcoins deposited into
the output, the symmetric key must be disclosed, thus allowing the decryption
of the data [5].

Essentially, the difficulty associated with understanding the mapping from `cleartext -&gt; cyphertext` is exacerbated (exponentially) with multiple rounds of hashing.

Deduced behavior from the current distribution of versions can only be attributed to soft-forks and general software releases.  Those versions, by definition, only follow the current consensus rules, and wouldn't show other [hard] forks.

@_date: 2016-12-01 19:37:40
In this particular context, that "series of bytes" corresponds to an agreed upon denomination of things we call "bitcoins."  That agreed upon denomination came from somewhere, which is an associated value to the "unit" of bitcoin.  We used these denominations as an exchange of value.  
If there is a medium, then it is considered money, if it meets a certain amount of criteria, which Bitcoin definitely meet.

The charts look quite similar, mind giving me a difference chart?  If the trend is the same in both plots, then the consecutive add-on means nothing.

My intention is to get at the reasons people are opposed to a hard-fork, and why a soft-fork may solve those reasons.  
It is at least clear, according to logic of previous comments in this post (not saying that is sufficient), that the process of upgrading a client is a poor argument.

you using a certain nomenclature to obscure saying "giving someone bitcoins" doesn't make it not using money.
@_date: 2016-12-01 19:56:53
Your "equality" conveniently leaves out the exchange of money, to which you **literally** refer to immediately afterwards.  
What I think you miss is the implicit evaluation of the tasks at hand in terms of the money.  You consider them equal because they both "cost" the same in some currency. 
The fact that something "costs" something means you've agreed upon an evaluation of a task or item in terms of some money.  
Your example above I assume uses USD.  If we are relinquishing control of UTXOs, and handing them off to someone else, then we are referring to Bitcoin.  The denomination of UTXOs we relinquish control of is the same thing, money.
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:30:04
The same triviality would apply to nodes, would it not?
@_date: 2016-11-23 20:49:14
When a userbase gets to certain size, particularly in regards to a system with a hierarchy of its user's technical knowledge and use, compromises must be made in terms of what percentage "consent" is important.  
The real question is where you draw on line on who to consider worthwhile to poll for "consent."  In other words, there is a percentage of users of high-level users that simply don't know or care, and their "consent" is worthless. 
Where that line is, I don't know, but it exists.

So we can agree that "Everyone would have to upgrade" is a poor argument against hard forks?

I think the instant factor is key for some.  From the people that I have gotten to purchase BTC from Coinbase, their main objection is "why do i have to wait ~4 days to get it?"  Society is about instant gratification, and although cryptos provide that, the entrance barrier to it is sometimes slow.

I discuss this topic in the [latest episode my podcast](  I keep hearing things like this since the new year, and I finally had to say something about it.  This comparison, although it sounds awesome (go bitcoin!), is a misnomer.  Comparing something so small relative to the leading currencies in the world leads to false conclusions, and really ends up as a detriment to Bitcoin as a whole.  
It makes us look like we don't know what we are talking about, and it would be much more satisfying to truly state the current level Bitcoin, and watch it rise as it succeeds more.  
Please, give us a listen.  We are definitely for Bitcoin as a whole, but try to not say too much stupid shit, in an approachable kinda-of-way.

It's not for everyone, and I quite enjoyed your parody of the synopsis.  The podcast is a mixture of typical conversation amongst friends and a bitcoin discussion, in efforts to keep it lighter than other podcasts, without the fake laughter.  
Some people don't want to listen to that, that's cool.  There are some great interviews in there though if you decide to listen anyway.

Compared to alternatives, even a more centralized bitcoin (in some aspects ) is a metric fuck ton more decentralized.  Most of people's complaints are motivated by fear of what could happen, and not what most probably will.

Your ethnocentrism and misunderstanding of how money works is second to none, good sir.

I've discussed this before with people pushing bigger block sizes or how the UTXO set scales, and they seem to dismiss with as if it doesn't matter.
The UTXO set _is the state of the network that everyone must keep track of_.  You change it by doing transactions.  If you scale users and every transaction generally increases the UTXO set afterwards (what happens before segwit), then you get to a serious problem later on down the line.
 
The increase in transaction fees that is ironically caused by this increase in UTXO set simultaneously makes those small UTXO inputs more expensive to use and combine in a transaction, thus exacerbating the issue at hand.

Interesting first comment on that article.  Not sure how I want to take it.  
I do hold some merit to the idea that it isn't quite necessary to use the technology in the future for only the sole purpose it was created, i.e. all blockchain technologies are use for censorship resistance.  
That's almost saying all internet creations should be used for governmental information sharing.

living?  a very small amount.  Usually, it is only a single aspect of their life that is closed, or a percentage.
The infrastructure to do so completely is still small, which makes people creating more closed loops so important and exciting.  
The more times this happens, the easier it becomes to operate only in BTC.

Nicely done, thank you for quality content that helps people make good choices.

I think the most important thing to consider in this link is the paragraph under "why gold cannot be an ideal money."
@_date: 2015-09-28 12:03:21
This is an interesting point.  I'm going to think about it more. Thanks for listening!
@_date: 2015-09-15 14:22:31
This is true, but to say that the majority of business operates this way certainly isn't.  There will always be a percentage that is "under the table," but if the majority of businesses operate this way, then there is an issue.

As adoption occurs, this non-taxable thing will probably change.  I don't think you can have a worldwide system that doesn't account for business profits.

I completely agree with this.

no, because a mempool is specific to the miner. There is no universal mempool, so the absence from something that doesn't exist can't be tracked.

I love how a bitcoinmagazine blogger ripped this off nasty, then gave no credit.

Corey here, from 
Here to clear up a few things, assuming it's already not too late and I won't get buried by the current feuds.
Our podcast is in a partnership with  (CT).  We are not journalists, and CT does not push us out as journalists.  This is important when people write articles around our interviews.  The interviews are easy to draw conclusions from and quote, because they are a direct quotes, but whatever we talk about outside of the interview is just speculation and the opinion of The Bitcoin Podcast.  
We interview people of interest in the community, shoot the shit with them, and then talk around the interview about whatever we want at the time.  Sometimes that's bitcoin, sometimes it's "blockchain", sometimes it's Street Fighter references.  It's an show, and we do it to have fun. 
We've gotten some tracking, and we've gotten some great guests, and CT wanted to push our content, so we decided to become partners with them, and become their podcast source.  
I'm always around reddit if you have any questions or want to come on the show.  If you're interesting, we'd probably like to hear from you.  If you're a troll, we don't.  If that makes you mad, start your own podcast.
P.S. Shout out to for being awesome and adding some great stuff to this episode.

I agree, we at The Bitcoin Podcast are big supporters of this.  Today we'll release an interview with the CCO about all the new developments.  Give us a listen (

**Interview starts around 26 minutes in**
Description: Wait so let me get this right, I have bit coins in this wallet, then I just pay as normal at a shop that accepts contactless payments?      Last year we had Plutus Chief Communications Officer Filip Martinka on during the early stages in which we learned that while other methods connect to a third-party exchange or hold considerable reserves of bitcoin, Plutus uses its own decentralized exchange to directly connect customers and traders. Now equipped with a new white-paper, we revisit Plutus to see what they’re up too. Don’t wait for merchants to accept bitcoin, use Plutus.it sucka!!

Yeah for Griff!  Mission accomplished.

You've got yourself an angle.  
If you aren't aware, the Copenhagen interpretation is only way of looking at quantum mechanic's.  Recently, it has been losing ground, specifically with a new form of quantum mechanics formulation that doesn't require the wavefunction at all!  
Check out [this](  It might give you some new material.  P.s, I'm a physics PhD specializing in quantum mechanics. ;)
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:21:50
That's exactly what I'm telling you, there is new physics.  We have a new formulations of quantum mechanics, that gives you the same predictions mathematically as wave and matrix mechanics formulations, but DOESN'T require the wavefunction to do it.  
The predicting power of the new formulation puts it on equal footings with the others, meaning that the interpretations of each have to be taken equally serious.

Abi Aryan is someone we follow on Twitter and thought she would be a great representative of Bitcoin to tell us what is currently going on in New Delhi. She continually works to educate and enable individuals and businesses to leverage Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. How exactly can Bitcoin prevent fraud from Hawala, which is an ancient system of money transfer which originated in South Asia and is now being used across the globe?! Topics like this and more! Abi is passionate about new technologies with special interests in machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, virtual reality, and IoT. She just wrapped up her position at Coinsecure, the leading Indian bitcoin exchange, as their Chief Business Development Officer. In addition, we bring up 90s cartoon “Bobby’s World” and discuss the 10 quotes that defined Consensus 2016
@_date: 2016-05-02 11:01:35
Any reason why you would think so, that is legitimate?
@_date: 2015-11-02 20:25:22
Based on the interview I had with him, Peter says that Mike is really on board with Bitcoin, and is attempting to learn everything he can about it.  
He seems to be interesting in the currency, and doesn't simply see it as selling his name for a buck.

The idea was to use my rig at home, octo-core i7 with ATI 6800 Series do something at night and while I'm at work.  If I get into it, I'll upgrade my work PC to do work while I'm at home and sleeping, considering I don't pay for the electricity there.
I'm still learning and finding this whole thing fascinating.  Buying a cheap ASIC and using it at work may be something I am interested in doing as well.. considering my room is heavily climate controlled (joint to a super-computer) and electricity is on the school's tab.

Good to know, I plan to tell quite a few people who miss the online poker scene, but aren't privy to the bitcoin movement.  Whatever helps get people interested in the currency is good in my personal opinion.
