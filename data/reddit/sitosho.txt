!lntip 100 does that count?

Hey Crowstock, no dumb question. You should always ask. You do own the forked coins, I assume you know that by your statement.
However, Lightning is not a nother coin, but a way to use your bitcoin (btc). It's kind of a network where you can send and receive btc with 'lightning speed' and pay almost 0fees (mostly only some satoshis, which is the smallest unit of a btc -&gt; 0.00000001 btc)
I suggest you download "walletofsatoshi" and play around with it a little. There are also some really nice videos on yt explaining the tech. E.g. from andreas antonopolous or rene pickart
Here you have some btc via lightning:

I guess so. I'm using Shango and BlueWallet. Both are not able to adjust oce you've scanned the invoice.
Does anybody know if theres a way to make it work in Shango?

Can someone please explain me how to use it? I have a lightning node but the requests tippin me generates are empty. Is it possible to change the value that should be send? I am using Shango Mobile Wallet.

How do you adjust the amount? When I scan the invoice the value 0.00 is fix. I can't change this.

Bitcoin / Lightning needs to be as easy as a whatsapp msg. No one should care about wallets, invoices nodes etc. I'm sure some super smart people are working on that already and this could realy boost adoption.
 Same situation as in kenia where people adopted mobile credit as a payment. It is super convenient.
I hope I can soon tip my noncrypto friends the same way it works here with the tip bot. And they then use it to buy a coffee or snack and get excited.

BTW I love it so far!!! Usability is pretty nice.
One more hint, I downloaded it to use lightning only, so I thought I could fund it directly. Took me a while to figgure out that you need to create a btc wallet first. When clicking on 'refill' you could spend a text explaining this.
Thanks for the great work!

It's not possible to select/adjust the amount that one wants to send. It stays at 0.00 $
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:09:05
Oh, too bad. Are you planning to change that?
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:37:51
Hi ncoelho, thanks for the quick reply. It did when I selected the btc amound to fund the lightning. 
But when I want to send a transaction via lightning, it dosn't. I've clicked everywhere. Using the Google Pixel 2XL on Android 9.

Nice! Love the bot!
