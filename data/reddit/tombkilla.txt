why anyone does business with them is beyond me. We have people who spend YEARS making financial applications and YEARS of auditing to ensure stability. Here we have 300M moved into software that hasn't even been around for years. WTF people. This is the same company that thought it was a good idea to have the last case of a withdrawl be "execute verbatim on the internal wallet" 
Not only would I say they have no idea what it means to make secure software I would say anyone here is a fool to trust ANY software that parity makes without considerable auditing and pen-testing.
If you can afford to lose 300M of peoples money you can pay a portion of that to have your code audited. If I was an investor in parity I would pull my money they are a risk.

Use an incognito window. Support told me to either disable 2FA (fuck that) or to clear my cookies. So I used an incognito window and I'm able to do withdrawals no problem.

Hey OP, I can't make withdrawals on CEX in a normal browser session, I have to use incognito mode for the 2FA to work. And this was the instructions from support when I told them I couldn't withdrawal.

You have any proof of this?

Took over a month for them to verify me, and I've had support answer me within 24 hours recently. I don't know what OP's problem is but CEX is still allowing me to do withdrawals.
As a matter of fact I just did a withdrawal to make sure.
