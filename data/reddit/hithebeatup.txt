Interested in responding to you if only to put these absurd myths to rest. [If I don't get back any constructive replies, I will have to assume everyone agrees with me and just does not want to face up to reality.]
How many people regularly say things like: I finally save money now because of bitcoin. The fact is most people throw money around like it means nothing and are compulsive consumers. Look at random new posts: Oh I just got $15 of bitcoin, what do I spend it on?. That is bad enough but then people respond: Use starbucks fold app to waste your money on overpriced frappacinos / Go to overstock and buy some junk / Use purse.io to buy some junk. --------- These posts are a dime a dozen. Hardly enough ever says in any context to save money by spending less or working more.
The statistics with Americans bears it out. With such a horrible mentality, it is no wonder real wealth derived from savings and making slowly compounding investment returns on those savings is a dream to most people.
As for your meritocracy whining, tell that to all the immigrants who spend their childhood actually studying and working hard in school and being called nerds to get top grades, and then becoming doctors and engineers with top salaries. Even with the high tuition debts, you can easily pay that off with a good job which is easy to get if you are qualified.
Contrast this with most kids who whine that: school sux and that: math is booooring and prefer to spend all their time playing videogames instead. Point is success starts early from day 1, and most people are too lazy and not willing to put in the hard work when it matters. They rather complain when they are adults and it's already too late to change the consequences of their actions from the first 25 years of life.
