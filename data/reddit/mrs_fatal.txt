Can you tell us more about this?
Does the lawyer say the proposal of Bitfinex is not legal?
@_date: 2016-08-11 22:09:15
Yes for now. Since there are periods of time when all blocks are full, there is a backlog and the miners have a clear incentive to include the transactions with the highest fee per kilobyte. If the blocksize were to be increased, this could change.

Ehm, so in order for this to work, you are going to convert a substantial amount of ETH, ETC and fiat into BTC. 
Any idea when you are going to this, not that I want to frontrun it ....

Wait till Sunday, most of the Sundays the mempool is almost empty and the fees are the lowest. Expect to pay 250 times 0,150 times 15.000 = over 500.000 satoshi for this transaction. 
A lower fee is possible but it might take a long time for the transaction to get confirmed and you might need to push the transaction a few times manually.
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:44:45
You might think that, but if only 1 party does not go along with their proposal and sues them it basically blows up in their face.

@_date: 2016-08-07 13:59:07
Correct, Zane only responds to a few questions and ignores the more difficult and in my opinion important ones.
If they implement their proposal, they will take ETC, ETH and fiat from some of their customers and convert them into BTC in the open market. Anyone who knows when they are going to do this can make a nice profit frontrunning it.

My thoughts for what it is worth.
Gold has been the best liquid store of wealth for a long time so anyone with a positive net worth should have some.
Bitcoin might be the best money we have ever had and the upside potential in purchasing power is still 500-2000 times in my view.
I can imagine if you are an investment advisor with mainly conservative clients that endorsing bitcoin will raise some eyebrows here and there and might even cause you to lose some of your clients. Let's see how their opinion changes were bitcoin really to take off.
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:56:19
Are the gold guys like Jim Rickards and Peter Schiff just talking their book or do they really not understand Bitcoin?
Any thoughts?

Paper is ok for cold storage if you do not plan to spend any of your bitcoin soon. But be aware of theft, fire, water, etc. You might want to encrypt your private key with a passphrase as BIP-38 can do for you.

Well then what is going on right now is a good test to see whether the vision of Satoshi is worth pursuing. If it cracks it is not, if it does not however, confidence in his vision will actually grow. 
Good things stand the test of time, let's just wait and see.
@_date: 2016-03-02 10:46:03
Well it would be a disaster when you would have invested a lot of your time and resources in something and then it ends up being a failure. These type of "stresstests" are in my opinion very good for the bitcoin community in the sense that they will prove failure, or prove resilience. When failure occurs, let's move on to something else, if however it does not fail, we have something that is good and worth working on. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:41:47
Yup, they may be operating on a fractional reserve basis already. That goes for everyone who stores coins for someone else.

Legitimacy is going up, upside potential still high.
People need time to process all the concepts, it seems everyday new people join now. Not because of ideology like what was happening until 2012-2013 or so but as diversification, away from the legacy system.
If you manage let's say 500 million dollars, you have some real estate, some bonds, some stocks, some precious metals, some art, some cash. Moving like 0.5-1.0% into Bitcoin seems quite reasonable now.

Why 2-3 months? If I look at the charts, the tops in the current bull-market are like 7-8 months apart. November 2015, June 2016, January 2017.
The only time the price penetrated the 200-day moving average during this bull-market was during the Bitfinex-debacle early August 2016. Right now the 200-day moving average is around 680 USD. If that holds, it seems to me that 700-750 USD is a good entrypoint going forwards.

1.Convert excess energy into BTC via mining
2.Use BTC to purchase whatever
3.`Whatever` was the excess energy available somewhere else in the world.
Is this a correct summary or not? If it is, and it would work, is that prove the network effect for BTC is higher than for energy?

Similar to my experience. 
It seems that the people who compare bitcoin of today with the internet of the early 90's are right when it comes to the percentage of the population that is aware of this new technology.
The feeling of being a (very small) part of something in the very early stages that might go mainstream one day is something I enjoy a lot.

The black market would select a new medium of exchange.
Do you really think that if the government bans cash, all the crystal meth addicts will say: "ok that's it, we quit"? Maybe crystal meth becomes money in some circles in such an environment.

@_date: 2016-09-08 17:57:19
That is interesting!
During his last conversation with Joe Rogan, Andreas Antonopoulos mentioned that there are over 3 million users of Bitcoin right now.
If you use the link provided by OP, you can see that there are less than 1,3 million addresses containing at least 0.1 BTC. 
Since quite a few people own multiple addresses the size of the BTC-community seems to be quite a bit smaller than the 3 million Andreas mentioned.
Or am I missing something?

Easy, it is like a foreign currency, you can exchange it for the local currency and spend it for your day to day purchases.
A lot of people in the world hold US dollars while their local currency is a different one.
Gold has proven to be a way better store of value than any fiat currency. 
If, like you said, a currency is only a medium of exchange, and nobody wants to hold on to it as a store of value, you get situations like the one that is now playing out in Venezuela.

Ok, thanks for the clarification. 
And how about money? 
I always thought money and currency were the same but studying BTC and gold gave me second thoughts. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 19:04:15
You are right, thanks for the help. 
That implies that there are people holding bitcoin on an exchange who do not have another bitcoin wallet. Anyone reading this who is in this situation?

What are your definitions for money and for currency?
And do you view US dollars as a currency in the specific case when people hold on to it while their local currency is a different one?
@_date: 2016-09-12 09:59:24
Yes, learn to sweep it. This means you transfer the entire balance on the paper wallet to for example your blockchain.info wallet. After that the paper wallet is useless and you should never use it again.
Quite some BTC has been lost by people making a payment from a paperwallet and losing access to the change.

As grnqrtr already mentioned, the state might view this in a way that you are running a business without the needed license. 
It is a bit like narcotics, the margins are great but there is a risk of getting in trouble with law enforcement.
I suggest you consult a legal expert on the matter before going large scale with your operation.
Good luck anyway!

Start experimenting with small amounts to gain the experience. After you have done it a few times you will realize how easy it is. 
However, if you want to cash out locally, liquidity is something you need to monitor on a regular basis. Make a back-up plan like visiting the closest real big city for cashing out if liquidity becomes an issue.

Semantics is an overlooked topic.
Bitcoin is often called trustless but people need to have trust in something, whether that is the people they hear talking about it, the protocol, the network, etc.
I find the math behind Bitcoin very interesting and stimulating and I have a good reason to study it now. For most people around me, I think they would have to trust the fact that other people trust it otherwise they will not start using it.
Any thoughts?

They do have something of it, namely the flip-side which is debt.
Bitcoin is equity based, big difference from the currenct money system.
@_date: 2016-10-06 13:55:00
Yes, it all boils down to economics I guess.
What I find interesting is that if technology allows it, Bitcoin could become a way to convert "waste heat" into a money/tradeable commodity.
@_date: 2016-10-06 13:33:00
Let's see what happens, maybe a few itterations are needed before someone figures out how to make it economic. 
The whole Bitcoin infrastructure consumes quite a bit of energy but re-using it might be a possibility if cost-benefit works out.
Question will be how people will view this device, a heating stove that also generates money, or a money creating machine that also heats your house.

The network effect for the USD is huge. It might be in the process of a long-term decline but the USD is still by far the most dominant currency in the world.
The value of the USD is relative to other currencies. Alternatives for storing value like the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan all have their own issues that make the USD look quite attractive on a relative basis. Other alternatives for storing value like gold, silver, bitcoin, etc. look even better from my perspective but I only represent one person while the markets represent a lot more, so who am I to argue with them. Let's see how this is going to play out over the coming years.
If you look at the size of all these different ways to store value, the potential for value increases for bitcoin is still huge despite the very impressive run it has had so far.
@_date: 2016-10-09 10:56:40
Just looking for facts here.
Has anyone here on reddit cashed out One-coins or know somebody else who has?
@_date: 2016-10-06 13:42:12
Maybe one of the reserve currencies.
At the moment there are multiple reserve currencies with the US dollar as the most dominant one.
But also the euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound are used as reserve currencies and the Chinense yuan renminbi is perhaps on his way to also become a reserve currency.
