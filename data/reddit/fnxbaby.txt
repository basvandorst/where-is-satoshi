adoption is usually the abillity to buy stuff in btc. since 99% of the time this means converting  btc to $/€/etc. this equals more sell pressure -&gt; lower price

it wouldn't be the first time in history. look at full tilt poker, the 2nd most successful online poker site was making $$$ but decided to tap into player funds. or Ultimate Poker which used superuser accounts (see all hole cards) to win in high stakes games.

you don't need verification (or only very minimal) on bitcoin.de for that amount.
op: not a lot of ppl are selling bitcoins with paypal (because chargebacks)

don't recommend alpha software to other people. You can use what you want but don't recommend un-stable software
