Sorry, i probably didn't understand your last post right. Your are right.
Sustainability of mining is getting real complex fast.

They are as sustainable as there are infinit coins. but who cares?

Another point i consider using bitcoin in a foreign country is that if your not familiar with language and coulture, you could be scammed more easily.

That's why I avoid regular mining bonds (e.g. 1MH/s per share). ASICMINER shares are not bound to a hashrate. They're bound to it's business. Only about 0.02x BTC are from mining, the rest is from hardware sales.
It's also dependant uppon the share price vs. the price of an BFL at the point when you want to sell it, but this is completly open…
Some say ASICMINER hardware is currently way overpriced, but as a shareholder this is good, as long as there are people who buys the hardware and as long as there is room for discounts.

Are the coins not finite at 21 Million? And after that, there are only the transaction cost to earn, which highly depends on people using bitcoins. Are there estimates, how much transaction costs are there to earn today?

I will. There was just one suggestion that came to my mind: please include also the more critical voices to a certain degree. Not the silly ones but the ones with substance. Else there is a risk to sound not authentic.

The number of shares is fixed at 400,000, so they are not beeing dilluted. Asicminer, as i understand it, has more hashpower at hand to maintain it's current network percentage. Beside that, you'll earn dividends not only for mining (about 0.013ps) but also from the income of hardware sales (minus cost for the hardware and developement).
