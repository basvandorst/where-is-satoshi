I see a lot of people getting into crypto because they expect it to worth a larger amount of their fiat currency in the future as a way to increase their buying power.
Those people should understand that if a crypto's value increases too much, it would mean that the fiat is worthless and its acceptance will decrease all around, thus the growth of the held crypto's buying power will be reduced.
If you can't imagine a world where fiat currencies do not exists, then you have understood nothing from what crypto currencies are about.

If the monetary system falls, the richer will have to possess the largest part of the currency that is the most used by the majority of people.
We would have to redefine richness as soon as fiat currencies may no longer be used as a common metric and medium of exchanges.
I bet BTC will be our new metric, but in fine other coins will be used to make payments for goods and services in the everyday life because any fees or delays are unacceptable for payments.

Some increasing supply does not necessarily mean inflation.
When you say "inflated", imagine when you blow into a balloon, the latter inflates, but this does not mean that  you are creating more balloons. You are just putting more air (which is not the object of the inflation) in it, so the balloon's size increases as a consequence.
This is what inflation means, it is not the right term to describe the variation of a supply. It is its consequence.

Why would you restrict the area ? It can be up to the whole planet.
One would feel bad just seeing everyone participate and he does not as it could be a daily subject that replace politics in the medias. There will be some social pressure to participate.
People who administrate the healthcare system are more likely to take the bigger part of the money needed to help the ones you want to help by the taxes you pay!

Having an healthcare for everybody living inside some area can be one of the participative project too.
I see and I trust that more will participate up to what they can afford when they have all the information about any specific case.
For instance, in France, some people donated in few days over 100k EUR to pay a yellow vest cop boxer's lawyers (he is now in jail and the donations have been stopped by the government). Later there have been donations for the cop in hospital that went up to a million in few days also...
The money will arrive quicker without being limited by any equity rules applied on some list of profiles or some rules to avoid corruption, self-profit or fraud. The one in need must receive the money at first, not at last. Massive administrative costs could be avoided using blockchains.
The more people will be informed, the more will participate, and because they would have statistically more money in their pockets at any time. A new kind of politics has to be created...

Digital money is scriptural money (this technique has been used for centuries) which represent the amount of money the bank owes you from the time you make a deposit. In Europe you can have a negative balance in a bank account what should not happen with real money.
This was especially made because banks realized they could only keep some "working capital" cash corresponding to the amount withdrawn by their clients during some period of time, and issue them scriptural debt money instead for convenience.
So when you contract for a loan, a bank increases the amount she owes you by adding a new accounting entry in its system, there is no new trees cut to print the money. And when you are withdrawing, the bank settle his debt to you.
If the banks fall, all their customers are fucked because banks can't repay their debt to them anymore.
Only exist bank's debts and cash. Banks are just making you to think the money you see on the screen that shows your account balance is real, but it is not.

@_date: 2019-04-29 05:43:37
I'm not saying that either. The acceptance is just beginning.
But you seem to believe that only exist bitcoin and the dollar to measure a price and a purchasing power.
Why do you think prices written in EUR are less than the ones in USD for the same good/service ?
The price is different but it expresses the same value.
I need less EUR than USD to buy the same thing but this changes at every moment, pricing with bitcoin is not different.
Bitcoin will be accepted only when the majority of the prices will be denominated in BTC, and not any more in USD. It looks like this is not imaginable by a lot of people's, including you, yet.
People buy bitcoin because they expect to have more USD, not to have more BTC. But it does not mean that from today their purchase power will increase if all the prices increases also (inflation is applied to everything that has a price). No acceptance is possible if you think that way.

@_date: 2019-04-13 22:36:48
Because no third party should interfere in an exchange of two parties in any ways.
Fees value can vary too much for no reason and can represent a lot of money if price increases.
Also, it would allow to be refunded integrally in the case of commercial disputes between the two parts.
Finally because it is technically possible.
@_date: 2019-04-13 22:24:51
I mean strictly fee less and instant, not almost.
@_date: 2019-04-19 23:26:07
If only rich people can transact because of the high fees, that means bitcoin cannot be used as cash by everyone using the Internet.
Cash don't need a third party to be exchanged and it does not make you lose more cash on every single transaction.
At some point, any fee, because of the uncertainty of its value for each transaction you will do, and especially if the supply is limited, can lead to the monopoly of the third party who takes those fees and to the death of the transactions, the market, the economy, the nature, and/or the people.
@_date: 2019-04-15 00:02:41
Just think about it a little bit. Bitcoin is a technology. There will always be technologies that does the job better, BTC is not Gold at all, it can be replaced by a more useful asset.
Try to pay something you need in the instant by sending BTC and cry about the variable amount of money (because it will depend on the price at the time you will spend) you will give to a third party who has nothing to bother in a two parts exchange to make your transaction possible and cry again for the time it will take for you to have access to the good or the service you need because the other part will not receive the payment immediately.
Then cry once more when you will have a commercial dispute and will not be refunded integrally from what you have paid. The more transactions you make, the more you will lose in fees and computing time.
How this will invite people to spend ? And if it is not spent, how can it keeps its value, at some point, people will stop to buy because they will not be able to pay in good conditions with it: price would go down.
What if fiat currencies disappear ?
@_date: 2019-04-15 01:02:58
It is my opinion as a basic user of payment services.
I don't know what BTC will do. But we must buy it to have access to all the other (and better) coins, because it is certainly not usable for payments.
BTC's technology has no solutions for the facts I have listed.
@_date: 2019-04-14 01:48:59
Digital mining is cool but in my opinion, is not what the average consumer will care when making a payment. The incentive is more made for the "geeks". Also mining has always been associated with environmental destruction.
For a massive adoption, the most successful coin has to be the coolest but also the cheapest, simplest and the fastest to use, it has to be the more discrete and frictionless possible. It has to do better than what we are using for payments today.
@_date: 2019-04-30 12:22:10

So expecting to increase its purchase power with a fiat currency by holding a crypto does not insure to have an increasing purchasing power with that fiat later at all.

@_date: 2019-04-28 07:40:47
You are wrong.
The object of inflation is the price, not the variation of the supply.
Describing some currency as inflationary means that the currency should make all prices to increase over time caused by an increasing supply of that currency.
At the opposite, a deflationary currency should make all prices to decrease over time because the money supply can only decrease.
@_date: 2019-04-25 02:45:59
To me, it is more an efficiency than an environmental issue, for now.
One transaction happens punctually (in a flow of multiple other punctualities) so it should not require more than some effort from the one who sends and some from the one who receives to update their accounts in the public book. When the transaction is done, there should be no more work needed (the machines should be running IDLE waiting for the next transaction to occur).
Having many machines computing hard, whatever a transaction happens or not, is certainly not efficient and does not necessarily bring more security.
This finally brings a lot of frustration to the average user, in terms of costs and time, which can prevent transactions from happening.

Against using it: Making transactions in BTC are expensive, take too much time and this can't be improved much. It is already 10 years and still no real change was made. With bitcoin, you need a third party to allow two individuals to transact.
Against investing money: More people have invested under current price than over, and it is still possible to invest no money but time.
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:12:38
Better use cash than bitcoin then.
@_date: 2019-04-13 21:57:46
To me inflation (as I understand it from wikipedia's article) is a consequence of the variation of supplies that we measure in terms of variation of the price. Inflation happens when a price increase because money supply increases more than the asset supply does, or when the price increase because the asset supply decreases more than money supply does decrease also.
Inflation takes both exchanged supplies and time together as parameters, it is not only the base or the counter's supply variation.
In astronomy, inflation is when the same mass takes more space-time.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:31:24
How will you price BTC if the system falls and fiat no longer exists ? How will you pay ?
I'm sorry for writing this but economy is not science. I trust no words from economists but only from pure mathematicians or quantum physicists when it comes to numbers and reality. Economy has never moved from the classical linear view, even with econo-physics and has always been a failing discipline in human history.
Until economy does deal with uncertainty, I can not listen anything from this field.
@_date: 2019-04-29 04:32:09
By losing value for a currency, I only mean losing the purchase power per unit of it.
If you need some number of units of a currency to live during some period of time:
\- You lose your purchase power when more money is created because prices are increasing and your are stuck with the same amount of money (your salary does not increase, in proportions, as quickly as money is created): Money's value changes.
\- You lose your purchase power because you earn less money than usual (lost your job or whatever), and it is most likely not directly related to the currency's supply nor its value.
If prices are going down, it means that the money supply or the demand for a particular group of goods or services (in the case of a bad economic conjuncture) are decreasing.
@_date: 2019-04-28 20:43:57


You are wrong.
If the dollar lose its value, then all the prices written in dollars will rise, not only bitcoin's.

BTC is far from being efficient. Same POW can be achieved more efficiently.
No more than one machine that need to transact should be doing the POW of its own transactions. This is possible, more efficient, thus eco friendly.

We could find a better expression than "tax" in fact, like a "participation". It would change a lot in people's minds.
Anyone could accept easily to act like in the participative economy to finance projects people believe or need. Some group could present the project to the community and list precisely what they want to do, how much money they need and how it will be spent.
The problem with taxes is that we have been asked to pay without having any idea (and a lot of lies from the ones in charge) of where the money goes. We could do it for any project that could concern our near environment easily.
I find "Tax" to sound more nationalist than the word "participate". Nations are run by governments, and governments can't stop to fuck the people. We only need countries, regions, not nations like Mr Smith thought was the best at his time.

@_date: 2019-04-13 20:40:40
I'm not sure if we can talk about inflation for BTC.
Because we all know how much BTC there will be and the fact that this number can never change. When you have 1 BTC, you are certain that you hold 1/21M of them, and not 1 over current supply. Only the difference in the current supply and total supply will make you work until all 21M BTC are released.
That is not true with fiat currencies that have infinitely irrational increasing supply. One would hold a number times 1 over an increasing number. Which mathematically tends to 0.
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:04:01
I totally disagree. Everyone does because of it. It is the first asset that have a fixed supply and that can be exchanged so easily.

There is still a lot of people who can make huge profits if they sell now, and I'm sure some could still make huge profits if they sell as low as 200$ because they had invested 0$. Those can wait forever to dump their bitcoins.
But there is a huge amount of money in the world that has not yet being exchanged for BTC and after ten years, there is still a lot of work to make its utilisation smoother as a currency you actually pay with (if you consider bitcoin as so).
As soon as there is no incentive for developers to work on bitcoin's protocol improvements (remember they are dealing with a non mutable P2P data structure...), except if they are also mining, I don't see how it can get better with time as it is now in terms of computational time and energy consumption that can make transacting a long and expensive experience. I personally find this very frustrating.
If you consider bitcoin like gold and have no plan to make any transactions, think that if everybody does same, miners would not be rewarded enough for their work, they would dump their earnings and stop their activity. And at some point, this could cause the death of the network.
That said, banks can't stop to print more money, they will continue for the next months and they are capable of doing so until all the financial system falls. But if they stop (because federal/central banks are most likely to raise their rates sometimes), then a huge amount of fiat money will disappear from the system very quickly and when it happens, only the demand for bitcoin will allow it to keep its value...
@_date: 2019-04-28 16:20:22
When a crisis happens, a lot of fiat money disappears from the system.
If it does, the market cap denominated in fiat will decrease, but it does not mean your buying power will decrease.
If the crisis is strong enough to make fiat currencies to completely disappear, it will not be possible to price a crypto other than using another crypto instead of a fiat.

It is now because governments use this vocabulary to mislead people who don't understand how money works. They don't see how it can be used as a currency at all, because for them, money is only cash or banking services.
But we can say they consider cryptos as stock because there is no adoption as a medium of exchange yet, and if people start to pay things with their coins, the governments will have to adapt the laws and the vocabulary they currently associate with crypto.
At least there is no VAT on it (at least in Europe) if you buy or sell. If you are holding and not trading, you only get taxed because of the newly created money from the federal/central banks because they consider you are making profits taking the difference of value at different times without counting the inflation of all prices.
At the point where crypto is being used to make payments, there will be legal uncertainty and a huge risks for governments, fiat currencies would be useless and could totally disappear (in quite some time though).

To make a transaction on bitcoin's network (which is not same as making a transaction on an exchange), a fee is paid in BTC and its value in fiat is proportional to bitcoin's price.
If bitcoin's price rises, the fee's value increases with it.

It is good for the crypto market.

Ok, but one can not live by making only two transactions a month.
If you pay your rent, energy, Internet and food, you need at least 5 transactions (one of them should be your income), and you will lose after each one.

What is bitcoin's use case then ?
If one satoshi would represent a hundred dollars, how will you buy things that worth less or equal 100 USD ?
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:51:25
You can be paid in Banano by folding for example.

In Europe we have no fees on ATM withdrawals or bank transfers ;)
We only pay for the bank's payment services (debit/credit cards and interests). Our banks also make profits on insurances and mobile telecommunications services, also businesses like Orange are becoming banks too.
Also we can make instant bank transfers for free that take 15min to an hour.
The only reason we need cryptos in Europe are to avoid inflation, avoid to pay for banking services that are also under inflation, and for ownership related topics.

This is more useful than just mining.

Are bitcoin miners consumers or producers of energy ?
Do producers of energy get paid in bitcoin ?
Do we have cheaper energy because of the existence of bitcoin ?
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:51:16
So you are betting the financial system will never fall and bitcoin's price will always be measured in USD ?
At some point, bitcoin's price, and maybe after, bitcoin's fees would have an infinity value because of the fiat hugely increasing supply. Do you think this can happen ?
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:24:22
Your english is very good ! It is not my mother tongue too ;)
But still, when you say:


You mean that you value bitcoin high, so as a lot of people I guess, but this is not true for all, so saying that bitcoin is "highly valued", or is bringing additional values over other cryptos, is subjective.
But it can becomes an [objective]( argument if you say it has higher value because it has a higher price or a higher market cap.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:27:20


So you are suggesting that when bitcoin price is too high, people should avoid to use it and wait for the price to drop and I agree with you.
@_date: 2019-05-27 19:27:24
I am currently, but using a 2012 macbook's CPU folding inside a web browser because the software that allows to mine from the GPU is Windows/Linux only, I get few units of BANs, it is not really worth it that way.
But people can get around 1 and 2 dollars a day worth of BANs using one GTX 1070 (I've seen it in the sub)
 I guess this will not stand for long.

You are buying bitcoin with bitcoin ?

I don't know but before Bitcoin was released, people used to fold for free.
Creators can distribute their newly created coins that way now, and this is great !

I agree with every words, bitcoin is almost perfect for all these things.
But for now I can not do any thing with it but hold and wait until the day it will eventually be used as a currency. And as I already said, I have no money I can afford to lose, I can not keep any amount blocked for more than few months.
Also when you say:


If adoption happens, bitcoin fees value could indirectly tell me I cannot transact every time I would like to and this particular point has always bothered me.
I do not want any third party to take any amount that is variable and which could be used to feed a whole family for a week every time I want to buy something expensive.

Since you can craft it to create jewelry which will add value to the final product, it is.
You can't do this with currencies or cryptocurrencies.
Gold has an utility value that bitcoin or any form of pure money will never have.

What is bitcoin's use case then ? Not to use it ?
So it is useless and you are blind.

Also agree with you.
That would also mean that no single crypto could replace fiat currencies any time soon.

WW3 is an economic war.

@_date: 2019-05-08 16:44:26
An economic crisis starts when prices are becoming too high for a majority of people because their income increases lower than the rate at which new money is created.
In other terms, the crisis starts when a minority of individuals/corporations/institutions can borrow more than what the working majority is capable to produce in currency measured volumes.
The object of the inflation is the price and it is a pure monetary effect that is not related to the wealth of an economy at all.
Actually, it is one of the causes of crisis.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:38:08
I did no mistake and I think people understood that I am only talking about the market value because it represents something that is true for everyone at any time.
The only way to quantify a subjective value is to spread out pages of words that can have different meaning for each person, so why bother mentioning it ?
If you really want to talk about philosophical or subjective values, can you tell what are the additional values that bitcoin brings and that any other crypto does not ?
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:44:15
Tho I was not pointing your very good post but people who mislead others with the term "value" to encourage someone who has not been educated about how money works to enter the crypto market !
Also, the amount of money one owns represents the rest of his work's production, or the value of its labor.
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:07:18
If prices are written in BTC and someone can buy things without a fiat currency then bitcoin is a currency.
If after all are mined people keep holding without making any transactions in bitcoins, then it can be anything else than a currency but bitcoin will die because there would be no more incentive for miners and nothing do to with the coins.
@_date: 2019-05-13 03:49:29
Bitcoin miners are earning infinite times the fees of every fee less cryptocurrencies combined.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:13:20






We are talking about bitcoin here. Gold has more than one use case.


That sentence has no meaning because you use two concepts that are not related at all.


It stores the value as soon as you want to use it and claim that value, because of the fees on every transactions.
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:38:34


So he has tested all the alternatives and came out with bitcoin ?
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:42:57


Yeah but all the bitcoin that are used for speculation are centralized in the exchanges addresses. Speculators don't really care about bitcoin... They want to make short term profits using the money that is usable today to pay everything. If they want to move their coins onto another exchange, they will most likely use cheaper and faster networks than bitcoin's to do so.
Adding this to the people who buy to hold their coins and never use them for 10, 20 years or more and you can find a dead network very quickly.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:03:00
Yeah, when you loose money, it usually goes to someone else if it is not burnt.
If you want to loose your money, it is your problem but do you really think this is what people who are using fiat currencies wants ?
I need solid arguments here, stop the bullshit.
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:40:31
They are overpaying fees because they want faster transactions.

I think they are wrong considering cryptos like assets because there is no dividend gain as returns by holding without work.
I mean, one can only earn by working to the creation of new unis (like mining a kilogram of gold or printing cash), or one can earn by doing some work for someone in exchange of some amount of already existing units.
One can invest in businesses that will do the work or invest in assets that will be used to do the work that is needed to have returns in the form of dividends in the chosen currency.
Holding some fixed amount of any currency does not bring anything like a dividend paid in that same currency, this is because a currency is only a counting unit and its spot value is dominated by the sell price of the ones who are working to create more units (the creators or the miners), who are the first distributers of the counting system (also by demand and supplies of exchanged pairs of currencies).
We don't earn more BTC when we hold some because no dividend is paid back in BTC. We must do some work (like playing games, resolving CAPTCHAs, trading, mining...) to earn more or to create new units of the coin since there is no more work needed to create the counting system as it does exist now.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:49:47
That amount can represent weeks of food for the majority of the planet.
And it can represent thousands of loss after more inflation of the price with some time.
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:05:21
I don't buy jewelry but, I mean, value can vary a lot more than bitcoin's price for two jewels of same k.
The difference is in the work that was needed to change the shape of the piece of gold into something one can find more valuable.
Gold can be money using a unit of mass, but a pure money can't be gold because you can't make jewelry with printed numbers.
Bitcoin does not melt, it is only numbers, it can not be crafted to create a new concept that has more value than itself, so you can not get more bitcoins by holding bitcoins and not working to earn more.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:05:38
If you only store bitcoin and don't use it, it will just die.
Miners will mine the coins that are actually used because they want the fees from these transactions, if everyone holds, there will be no transaction, so no more miners.
You are blind if you do not see it.
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:38:33
You are right, I dont know what bitcoin use case is and I find this a good reason for asking very precise questions to the people involved before I put any usable currency into it.
I've been watching bitcoin since the end of 2009, I know I could have made huge profit but I really needed and I still need every euro I earn to pay everything without any debt or credit. I do not feed that big troll since 2011.
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:19:30
That theory is wobbly because you forgot the investment part that is needed to buy the mining rigs and to create the cheap energy that are necessary since you are starting with no bitcoins.
Also, you say that it "will" happen but in 10 years of existence, that behaviour has never been observed.
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:01:42
I understand what you meant even thought the object of the inflation is the price and not the supply, but why do we need an increasing supply of money ?
Why do people say we need all the prices to keep increasing knowing that not all the salaries could ever follow the same rate ?
When gold was the money standard for milleniums, any society could thrive multiple centuries without knowing any economic crisis, economy did not exist at all in fact.
All the prices were decreasing, so people could become rich only by holding the money they earned from their work with no concerns about the time they will retire. This, until the people from Europe brought the gold they have found in the almost virgin America they "discovered" which drove to the revolutions from the poor because bringing more gold made them poorer.
The money supply should at most follow the demographic growth instead of being increased exponentially like we do today. Otherwise we don't really need inflation, it creates businesses that are toxic because of the necessity to earn always more money in order to keep the same purchase power at the expense of nature.
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:05:49
A deflationary currency does not necessarily conduct to a recession (which is different than a "deflating economy"). This has been the case for centuries, maybe milleniums with gold as money standard.
There is a recession when what is produced is not consumed, and it can be because the society does not need the good or the service anymore, or because the prices are too high. The monetary policy will never make the basic needs of a society to disappear, but for sure, it can make things worse if there is hyperinflation or hyperdeflation.
But a deflationary currency absolutely can make toxic businesses that exist today to disappear. Would it be bad? I do not think so ! But there are a lot of them and there are people working for these.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:44:56
Can I burn some of your coins the way everyone benefits ?
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:38:56
I don't think the majority of people that are not already engaged in cryptos (which could represent 99% of the population right now) will be happy to know they will loose money every single time they will want to spend it.
But anyone can drive its own bets for the future !
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:11:41
Ok, let me try to illustrate the problem differently.
If from tomorrow, every dollar changes to become a crypto currency with fixed supply, and this, without changing anything in the actual system with all the coins that are already on the market, then bitcoin's would lost its store or value property because there would be inflation in favor of the crypto-USD (I'm not talking about stable coins here), or in other terms, deflation of bitcoin's price, because more new bitcoins will be created.
Same would apply for gold if this happens.

Where does your equation come from ?


What do you mean by "the energy source is released" ?
Because if the miners are consuming the energy from their providers, the latter will have less energy to produce once they stop mining.
If the miners are also producing the energy, how do they become energy providers ?

Like a deposit bank account which guarantees how much your bank owes you (your share of the circulating supply of the chosen currency), yes.
