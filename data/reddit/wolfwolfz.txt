@_date: 2019-03-17 15:02:31
Then if u question its thriving why do u still hold your position? Or did u blindly jumped in on the hype without due dilligence? Maybe u are in a loss and want confirmation that everything is ok and going well? In that case, just have paitience, btc is deflationary and has a huge network effect. But be sure to sell the top on the next rally so u dont get dissapointed. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 15:47:10
No i actually mean it, calm your tits
@_date: 2019-03-17 12:48:47
Still btc is number 1 and u cant do shit about it
@_date: 2019-03-28 08:47:10
Its capitulation if u are shorting, so u panic buy to stop losses from increasing. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 12:54:05
Lol look at all the butthurt haters, point is i can now pay with btc and i personally dont care if they receive fiat or not

@_date: 2019-03-25 18:03:51

Dont beat around the bush with nonsense questions, u are against btc and i give u a straight up real answer that u wont do shit about it, there is enough btc information why it is number one. Its network effect alone beats every other coin, dont act dumb the info is everywhere but you are selfish and dont want to see and acknowledge its success.

Just mentioning that the pump and dump scam runned by crooks is a contender to the Bitcoin name is enough to recon that eth and bcash are desperately hoping for the bitcoin “dead spiral”, vitalik also congratulated bcash for their achievements.

These people gathered to demand their money from the bank. She explains how hard it was for her to gather the money to put it into the bank for interest and nobody is answering their concerns. Shareholder of different financial institutions in Iran have, in recent years, protested time and again complaining of not receiving their money or even the interest of their shares.
Financial institutions have grown rapidly in recent years in Iran. These institutions borrow money from people with the interest rate of 18 to 20 percent, but loan others with the interest rate of up to 25 percent, making 5 to 7 percent interest just out of borrowing and lending.

You are wrong, the price doubled couple months before the halving, and a couple months after the halving it kept growing and growing. After every halving btc price been exploding, the next halving will be huge. Buy now or get left behind.

Every 4 years, bitcoins block reward will halve, currently 12.5 per block are produced, this will change to 6.25 btc. No your btc wont halve, buy as much as you can, next halving will be the catalyst for huge price increases.

Thank you, but why would it bee foolish if he would touch some of his btc? Wouldn't it be good news that he is still here? And cant he spend btc anonymously? Just send them to a mobile wallet and make a purchase or something. Just because he touches them doesnt mean he is going to do something bad, i think it can also be seen as good news and gives bitcoin worldwide attention.
