I know, I've used one, on a trading desk on Wall Street.

Not quite true. Bloomberg didn't build a $22 billion by providing charting tools and information because they don't work, Fama is disputing efficient market theory here. Charting techniques can provide other ways of visualizing information, and while it is true that past indicators are not indicative of future prices, statistics can help in decision making.

I'm better at both.

Claims to know what anecdotes are, misspells it "anectodes", then decides flames are a smart way to have a conversation.
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:51:11


I do not think that word means what you think it means.
My point is, traders, who make real money use TA. I've worked a trading floor, it isn't b.s. it is real. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:02:44
Not like this: "Way to simplify Bloomberg. You love your anectodes don’t you?"

If you read the charts at a 1 week bar, there is clearly no confirmation of an uptrend. At the moment the price would have to break above \~$8362.1 USD to confirm a reversal. If I was anything but a day trader I would be sitting on the sidelines, even if I have a long term belief in the asset. 
@_date: 2019-11-22 02:31:39
The strangest thing is when you realize that you only buy when the price is in a proven uphill channel. Yah, you miss the very bottom, but it is a fool proof method. Right now I wouldn't buy until the price closes above 10.3K

A thoughtful response. I agree with you. Buying on momentum is a traders mentality, for those looking to buy low and sell high. If you won't ever sell, then the $ price is literally irrelevant. I want to hold gold as a stored value asset as well, but I still convert it back and forth into $ in order to increase the overall value of my buying potential (which is what all traded items are: proxies for potential to buy). So, by converting my buying potential between asset classes that are on a momentum uptrend I am increasing my potential. I think people here get lost on the belief that fiat, or gold or whatever are worthless (eventually), maybe so, but in the present they alternate in how much buying potential they represent. At the moment, bitcoin represents less potential than the $, or gold for that matter. That could change overnight, or next month.
@_date: 2018-10-12 04:21:52
OK, so because people have asked: a reversal for bitcoin would be: 8109.01  as of today
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:56:11
I have believed in many asset classes: gold, oil, natural gas, stocks, sectors like tech, bitcoin. But it doesn't make any sense to HODL any of those classes when the statistical odds are against them. If you knew for a fact that an asset class was going down for 1 year you would juggle classes to your benefit, of course you would. So while no one can say that an asset class is going to rise tomorrow it is possible to say that a class has reversed and that historical odds favor a further rise after such a reversal. That may not be correct, but it is better than other rationales. If you don't have a proven, tested reversal metric you should. There is nothing indicating that bitcoin is showing a reversal. S&amp;P (to the negative) and gold (to the positive) have just proven the probability. One should trade accordingly.

anyone who reads a chart.
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:24:31
of course it does.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:20:26
Sure this is possible, statistically possible, which is no guarantee, but does help. Study the MACD and RSI indicator, and I'd suggest setting it to the 1 week bar just so you don't get short term signals. Google them on investopedia. good luck. I use a different indicator myself, which I don't share, but there are many that can help you know when momentum is positive.
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:42:33
someone was right. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:38:18
Oh yes. I’ve done that. That’s why I’m not in bitcoin at the moment. For perspective I got into gold at 350 and out at 1200. But, I’ve lost fortunes too. My first bitcoin purchase was in 2011 and I sold for 300% profit, haven’t been back since. I rode oil all the way down, and natural gas too.  So I have experienced the ‘fundamentals’ that ‘guarantee price movement’
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:42:02
As of right now, a confirmed short term reversal of decline is: 5832. Longer term reversal must cross 7659. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:59:51
agree completely.

mathematics and probability. which are fallible, but useful guides

My prediction ([ for 10/1 was 4873, Was off by a month and change.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:49:36
You'll see. It just means, only when it crosses 7894 (as of this moment) does it confirm an uptrend that is worth buying. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:47:34
current technical analysis says that until bitcoin crosses 7864 (as of today) that it is not a buy, so, as I said last night, it is better to sell, no matter your position, and rebuy when the indicator says that there is a sentiment and momentum change.
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:21:28
so true
@_date: 2018-11-16 03:47:22

Justing looking for the confirmation of a trend reversal, patience.

Well listen, I'm not here advocating sell or buy. But, personally, I've been in positions (oil, nat gas, gold, silver, and other commodities ((I'm a commodities trader))) where I've seen the technical numbers stacked very much against my position. In other words, I was wrong. In every single instance it is better to sell as soon as you realize this, than to continue to hold. If you are wrong, then something in your calculation is off, and you need to re-evaluate. The sooner the better, in all cases. I usually switch to paper trading at that point to re-calibrate my senses.
My point here is not to mention any of that, but rather to point out that there is a ridiculous sense about bitcoin that has approached a cult or religious fervor. I've seen this before and it is always, always always a sign that people should step back and evaluate their assumptions. "But this time is different" really screwed me in the late 1999s.  When I was a young and enthusiastic participant in the next big thing. And yes, many of the technologies and ideas went on to become bigger and better, but not necessarily the ones that I/we were invested in. In other words, people lost real. Intelligent, highly capable people. I was working for a large brokerage firm on wall street then, and I can tell you, as many others, that smart, smart, smart people took it in the shorts.
rant over.

I didn't tell you to stop. just reminding you of the perils of your groupthink: [Groupthink]( is a phenomenon when a group of people get together and start to think collectively with one mind. The group is more concerned with maintaining unity than with objectively evaluating their situation, alternatives and options. The group, as a whole, tends to take irrational actions or overestimate their positions or moral rightness.
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:28:30
yah. probably not tho. But I'm not into a dick measuring contest so, I could care less. HODL all you want 'bro'
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:05:13
Yes, you've just done the wave at a high school football game. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:01:03
??? Not sure I follow? I don't care if you buy or sell personally. Just stupid to reinforce the groupthink with slogans that are trying to inspire herd like group think. People should act for themselves rather than form bizarre clicks of propaganda messaging. It is not a good look.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:43:36
You're right. I forget how ridiculous it is to be 20. But, mark my words some day you'll look back on this as childish behavior. Oh well. carry on.
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:12:33
Sure. carry on. Best of luck.

Pretty sure you're going to feel like a child...but I get that it isn't clear to you now cause you need a tribe of bros because you don't know how to survive in the world. but, set a reminder to revisit this in 10 years. then, buy me a beer.
