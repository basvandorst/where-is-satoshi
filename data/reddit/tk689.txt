Do you realise Hong Kong and China are two countries?

If you don't know that Hong Kong and China are two countries you need to go back to basic geography.

Do you really just trust what these China men say though?  Do they have a licence to operate an exchange in Singapore?  No one has actually visited their so called Singapore office as of today.  I am sure when their Singapore office gets exposed, they will say they moved to some random countries again.  Cause you know what's funny?  People actually never do their own due diligence on anything other than watching a couple Youtube videos and a few posts on Reddit.  Watching a few Youtube videos aren't due diligence for God's sake.  Do a site visit.  Use legal searches.  Consult with gov't agencies.  Ask the local community.  That's proper due diligence.  And you know what sounds even funnier?  You guys asked KuCoin themselves and believed whatever they throw at you.  Will the con man tell you he's con-ing you? You guys are just sounding so desperate.  You didn't put your life savings in KuCoin Shares did you?

The guy called jiangnanyun is a Chinese Communist Party hired internet troll. The Chinese Communist Party literally spends more than 20 Billion per year just to spread these false comments to further isolate their own people. I think you can ignore him.

"Have I even read a history book?" Dude, you talk full of bias. It's time you sort yourself out and get yourself in one piece. I simply wouldn't honour the few communists as a country. 
Not only do they send millions of Uighurs into re-education camps, they burn down temples in Tibet and imprison every political dissident, while at the same time, send all their family members and friends into house arrests. They bribe and take away the land and hard-earned money of every Chinese citizen. Their Nobel Peace Prize winner was tortured and died in prison.  
I have zero idea why you would even honour them as a government, a country or anything that we in the modern world would understand. You sound like you are legitimising the commies and justifying it for them. I personally have strict moral grounds and I won't do that. I ain't sure about you anyways.

To state it precisely, there's no government in China. There's only the Chinese Communist Party, which is a criminal gang oppressing their own people, after they got into power.

China is not a government. China isn't even a country. It's the commie murdering and stealing from their own people, and everyone else who are now in their controlled territory. It's like a terrorist group taking over a piece of land. Check their rule of law rankings. It's close to the bottom of the 102 studied nations.

I think you are mistaken. China is not a country. It's the Chinese Communist Party only.

Shame on you to really compare US to China. Have you looked at their rule of law rankings before you even utter that crap?
@_date: 2018-10-25 16:30:07
Do you know what goes wrong with that line? **Taiwan's** passport also says the "Republic of China". So are there **two Chinas** now?

I ain't playing anything with you. It simply perplexes me when you would compare China to any other countries, as if you'd honour the Chinese Communist Party with the status of being a country, when all they do is really to coerce and deceive and send people they don't like to labour camps. In case you don't know, their rule of law ranking is close to the bottom of the 102 studied "nations". It simply perplexes me how you'd compare a few dirty communists oppressing an entire population to an actual country.
