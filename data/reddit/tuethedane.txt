@_date: 2014-05-30 17:13:52
I think its because all of the tipping has distributed a lot of change that people tip forward. I tip people and get tipped and i never made a deposit to changetip wallet. Its great fun. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 12:35:06
Is there a way to avoid having my wallet sync everytime i open it. First time took two days at least, now faster but still annoying. Can i speed this up?
@_date: 2014-06-07 10:35:16
Woah dude

Yes, there is no need for other methods, bitcoin is the next bitcoin.

I filled it out, i think its good that people write about bitcoin. Remember there is a large selection bias  when you advertise like this on reddit. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 18:16:29
Bitcoin is the base unit not bit. You could call 1000 bitcoin a kbitcoin though. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 15:32:11

What am i looking at? Sorry if this is a dumb question, but why would it not be distributed equally?
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:50:34
But that is not the point nor does it answer OPs question. Also im pretty sure its not that simple.

I have earned a miniscule amount from tips and odd jobs on /r jobs4bitcoins, no fiat involved. 
I have spent in on playing poker on sealswithclubs, i dont have enough to buy anything online really, would like to try it though when i get more :) 
The biggest hurdle is that i dont trust to buy with fiat on the web because i am paranoid, and that i dont have any fiat to but with anyway. 
@_date: 2014-09-15 17:11:32
I will sign up when i get of work :) And ill do my best to make a good comment
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:56:17
Just gamble it away, it will kill some time at least. Thats what i do when i have spare money of any kind. Im desperately poor, but i get to spend a lot of time in front of my computer so that is nice. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:04:13

This post really hit home for me. 
I got a call yesterday from my mom who has been battling lung cancer. 
She had been scanned in the hospital and it turns out her last round of chemo did not work so now her cancer is inoperable.
She is going back to the hospital in 2 days to make a plan for life extending chemo and palliative care. I do not know how to deal with this, but i will try to be there for her. 
I can only imagine the added hardship having to worry about raising money for treatment must bring. I have made a donation to help you and i hope people here will do the same. 
I will pray that your mom gets better soon.

This would not be a problem if people had not kept their BTC on a trading platform for MtG cards. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 13:15:41
No they took it under false pretenses, as they are not following the agreement laid out in the contract. It's not a theft, it's a scam - i don't think that makes it any better.

Yes because no one ever got scammed with fiat...
Edit: Thanks for the downvotes, if you think bitcoin is the problem here as opposed to scamming you are frankly being moronic. What is actually the problem is the scam, and my point is that people have been scammed out of fiat long before they got scammed out of bitcoin. Bitcoin is not the problem here. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:28:18
Implying they wont lose it again when the fiat+stocks come crashing down. Stay in BTC for real value. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:32:02
We will get the money back soonish!
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:00:07
I went to a bar two days ago and some chick said she wanted to pay with BTC, i did not know it was an option, as they did not advertise it. The bartender did not know how to do it though, so she paid in cash instead. 
The next time i drop by i will try to pay with BTC myself :)
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:35:29

@_date: 2017-11-14 07:13:12
Does it really cost 10 $ to send BTC now? Or is it because of a unique problem and the amount i added ad fee would be normally okay?
