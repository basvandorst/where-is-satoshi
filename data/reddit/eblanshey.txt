Does this mean that they will be allowing users to hold their own private keys, similar to greeaddress? If so, this would probably make it the ultimate online wallet, as it would combine personal storage for large amounts, along with easy day-to-day spending via their checkout.
If they're talking about holding the keys for you, then nevermind.

I would argue that Ethereum holds a lot of value, and that the money could be used to further the distributed application ecosystem, but to each their own, I guess.
@_date: 2014-07-27 14:07:39
If successful, Ethereum would have as much intrinsic value as does Bitcoin. It is both a fundraiser for the development/ecosystem and an investment in the tokens that run said ecosystem.
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:43:17
What on earth are you talking about? They've got a testnet running, which you would have seen had you looked at their development updates. They've got videos on YouTube with demonstrations of the software running a Dropbox-like app on the network. Visiting their github would show you plenty of code and documentation.
I'm on my phone so can't give you the links, but doing some searching would have shown you this.

Remember that it's just software, so there is no "policy" like an organization would have. The government wouldn't be able to shut it down like they did with the Silk Road. The only thing they'd be able to do is the usual stuff, analyze traffic from the ISP (would be harder with TOR, though), locate packages, etc.
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:48:02
I've spoken with people who don't care about the privacy, centralization, etc aspects. For them, the primary reasons boil down to two things:
1. Cheap international transfers (which are pretty much always expensive).
2. The promise of lowered prices in the marketplace. I say "promise" because merchants are paying 2-4% in credit card fees, which they pass on to the customer. Most places that accept bitcoin currently do not offer discounts for accepting bitcoin, even though they're saving the 2-4% (though some do). As more and more people start using Bitcoin, more and more merchants will start passing on the savings to their customers.
At this point, unless you're often making international transactions, the primary reason is just to show support for a fair currency that's cheap, global, fast, and secure, which in the end will benefit everybody.
If you do care about the privacy/centralization issues, however, then bitcoin is a no-brainer.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:49:42
Agreed, I wouldn't use them for any large amounts of money. I believe they're more of a good solution for non-tech-savvy people at the moment. Eventually hardware wallets with multisig capabilities should be able to replace all these.

You know you've been on here for far too long when you can figure out abbreviations like this in a matter of seconds.
@_date: 2014-11-14 02:33:59
It's just harder to bootstrap what they're doing without a coin. Having a coin with value means people will want to provide bandwidth to the network for it.
Anyway, that's just one reason for it. The other reason is pretty massive, IMO: it's complete different from bitcoin in architecture, mining, everything. It does not use a blockchain at all, and by design, it's made to be a lot more scalable. It's a whole new ball game, really. At this point, I'd say it's as uncertain to work as the original bitcoin client that Satoshi came out with. That is, it's a complete experiment. But if it works, then it's going to blow everything else out of the water.
But again, I'm not trying to proselytize you. Just read up on it yourself and make your own conclusions. It's just not related to bitcoin or altcoins in any way.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:30:53
Decentralization is the main underlying innovation of bitcoin, not anything else. Without it, Bitcoin is just another money transfering service.

Yup, the Electrum command line has supported it for quite some time.

Indeed, this has me very excited! If you can pull this off with both proper anti-spam protection and a workable, decentralized reputation system (no easy feat for sure!) then I believe that this, along with bitcoin, will truly revolutionize commerce. I'd attempt to sell stuff there first before going on ebay, just to support it.
Thank you for your work!

It's impossible, from an engineering perspective, to foresee all problems that will arise in the future. Saying we need to solve all future problem now is just unrealistic, in my opinion. We will certainly face problems, some of them small, some potentially disastrous, and I would rather have others to fall back to in those cases.
I totally agree that the network effect is important, but I believe that there will still be room for many. Bitcoin is still very small, but its network is already impervious to many attacks, and this is just the beginning. Eventually, new ideas will come up (such as new ways to mine besides proof of work/stake) that will make currencies even more resistant to attack. But sometimes the only way to know how good they are is to use them.


Indeed, decentralized exchanges are certainly possible. Someone's already building one on the Ethereum network, I believe. Exchanging cryptocurrencies will be trivial.
But I guess we'll have to agree to disagree :)

Although it's not the goal at the start, that's the long term goal of [MaidSafe]( It's a decentralized internet infrastructure. They've got a working testnet running, too. Join the forums at maidsafe.org and ask some questions if you want.

The idea here is that the coins will be put to good use, to help decentralize the network.

Aha, that may be probable. That is psychologically better for customers for sure. Exchange rates vary a lot between exchanges anyway, so it may or may not be noticeable, depending on their markup.

You forgot that it's free for bank transfers, vs Coinbase's 1% + $0.15 fee. Once I connected and verified my bank, once I buy bitcoin they show up instantly in my account for free.
@_date: 2014-05-21 12:20:12
To be honest with you, the topic isn't related to bitcoin directly, so you'll have trouble making it fit in. Perhaps what you can do is give real-life examples of agile software development in bitcoin-related companies. This will be easy to do if you've personally worked on bitcoin software development. If you haven't, you could reach out to a company like Coinbase and ask them about their development. They'll likely want the free exposure, and yet you'll be able to give real-life helpful examples for the attendees of the conference. And of course, you'll give a brief summary about what bitcoin is before you begin.
@_date: 2014-07-02 21:40:23
This is one of the many reasons why I support multiple currencies. People are used to the fact that they only use one daily (whether USD, Euro, etc), but it doesn't have to be that way. I envision a future where everyone's wallet can have 10-50 various cryptocurrencies in it at once, thereby not keeping all eggs in one basket. If one currency forks/collapses, all the others are still fine (and will learn from each other).
There are just too many good ideas floating around to limit us to a single currency. I think the "monopoly on money" idea should be seen for what it is, a legacy of the archaic system that is no longer needed. Indeed, decentralizing the decentralized currencies is important, too!
@_date: 2014-11-25 01:42:32

This is great. More individuals that want to see Bitcoin succeed should do this. Perhaps announcing that x% of all earnings will be distributed fairly amongst all P2Pool miners when blocks are found.

1. 0 fees for you is the biggest reason (free for non-profits through bitpay)
2. Holders of bitcoin would need to pay ~1% to convert to fiat.

You can't incentivize the growth of the network without its own token. Bitcoin would not grow without its mining algorithm which creates new coins.
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:44:20
My bad, got mixed up with another thread. It's still 1% (or $30 flat fee a month) vs a fixed 3% with credit cards.
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:45:16
They're not at all based on bitcoin. They're doing things completely differently, and incentivizing the network requires their own network tokens.
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:53:20
And thanks for the tip! Will pay it forward.
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:22:26
I'm not sure we can know for sure, but as more money flows into it, more individuals/organizations will want to donate to it. The bigger the opportunity to make money, the more people will join, thus diversifying the miners.

Besides smartphone devices, Electrum works just fine for me. Sometimes I have to restart it, but that takes like 10 seconds. Not sure of one that works for both computers and android, though.
I wouldn't do that with large amounts of money anyway as it's risky. If you're doing it with small amounts of money, then there's no reason not to use something like GreenAddress.it or something similar. They claim they don't have the ability to take your coins, but if you're not holding large amounts there it shouldn't matter anyway.
@_date: 2014-07-20 15:10:46
Another cool one is escrow with a third party voting pool (buyer, seller, voting pool). For example, 8 of 15: 4 keys each for buyer/seller, and 1 for each of the voting pool members. If all goes smoothly, the buyer and seller sign, which is the required 8. If they don't, then the majority of the pool decides who gets the funds (4/7 voters + 4 from the buyer/seller). Because the pool only has 7, they don't have enough power to collaborate and steal the funds for themselves.
To change the amount of voters, just follow the simple 2n-1 rule, where n is the number of keys the buyer or seller has (in our example, 4).
@_date: 2014-11-09 01:51:19
Fair enough. You can say the same thing about anything. Don't trust something until you've researched it yourself. However, if you believe that bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that should exist or would ever have a chance, then I think that's a bit narrow-minded. Not saying that's what you believe.
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:41:56
There is nothing wrong with third party services if you only keep small amounts, which is likely as a facebook wallet. It will be a great avenue to introduce bitcoin to others.

I actually recommended this elsewhere but didn't receive a response. Instead of permanently burning coins, why not have the burned coins be donated to all the miners on p2pool? It's like donating to charity, but in a decentralized manner.
I still need to do more research on how p2pool works, but from what I understand it uses its own blockchain. Thus, it would be possible to prove if funds were donated to the proper addresses during a certain point in time.
This links has info on how to donate: 
Not only would this reputation system work, but it would go toward securing the bitcoin network. The more people use openbazaar, the more people will want to start mining on p2pool, further decentralizing mining.
This definitely isn't the easiest solution to implement, but if done right I think it can work well. Would be nice to get some feedback.
@_date: 2014-10-21 01:46:11
What's you pricing structure like? In the About page you mention it's cheaper than a $40 wire, but if you charge a percentage like 2%, it'd be more expensive for anything over $2k. Or do you charge a flat monthly fee?
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:43:55
If they can pull it off, then it's certainly great for bitcoin to be able to buy without any fees--that does seem to be one of the limiting factors for new adopters ("why buy bitcoin when I can use cash/cc for free?". But the question is, how can they afford to do that and still stay in business? The video clearly shows that they allow credit cards, which will incur them a 2%+ fee, and will also be subject to chargebacks. Even with their identify verifications, that won't stop someone from buying $200 worth of bitcoin once (like in the video), and requesting a chargeback.
If the idea is to make money with merchant services (like mentioned in this thread), then to offset fees they'd have to charge 2%+ for each transaction, which is comparable to credit card fees.
I really do hope that there's nothing nefarious about this service, I really do. But I question how they're able to do this. Are they selling user information? Do they have some sort of new business model in the works? What's going on?
I'm eagerly keeping watch.

I'm not sure how you come to that conclusion. I can make the same argument about anything in the free market. If one bookstore in town has the best intentions, what's the point in having an additional one open across the street? 
- It can do something in a different manner than the first bookstore.
- If the first bookstore closes (or a currency collapses for whatever reason), the second one works as a fallback.


The money supply does not increase. One currency will bring the value of another one down, so it'll always even out. I'd rather have many currencies in my wallet of various values than one currency. All this sounds complicated, but the wallets will take care of all this seemlessly.
As for reasoning for "how things will be done differently", for example we could have crowdfunded coins. Usually when we fund an organization, they get the money and that's that. Eventually we can have biologists coming out with BioCoins with a "premine". Anyone who wants to fund their research will buy coins from them at launch. A small ecosystem can emerge where all supporters of the biologists will transact using those coins. This is great because a) your money is not completely gone once you buy, all the while b) the scientists will make money from the initial launch.
This is just an idea, but I can definitely see a lot of different coins coming out for various reasons.
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:26:57
And don't forget that it's the buyer that would pay for protection, not the merchant. And rightfully so. Why should the merchant pay for the buyer's protection?
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:35:26
No apparent way yet. They've VC backed so they don't necessarily have to have a way to make money yet. Eventually they may add premium services.
Some people say that make money from buy/sell spread, but some reports I've see from others claim that's not true.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:17:34
While I won't argue with that, it's also easier to make more money when you have money to spare. Starting a new business is much easier when you have the capital for marketing, sales, etc. If you don't have that capital, it really makes progress slower and harder.
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:13:48
Most merchants already have refund policies as a standard. If you don't trust them with their policies, then either you shouldn't shop there, or you should purchase insurance. By having the merchant pay the fees, they inevitably raise their prices for everyone to compensate (they don't eat the costs). Yes, you're still paying for your insurance. It's not free.
@_date: 2014-07-20 15:00:18

Intro Video: 
White paper: 
MaidSafe has been working long and hard on the new decentralized internet, called the SAFE network, and its release is just around the corner. SafeX (Safe Exchange) will be one of the first apps that will provide a decentralized marketplace for goods and services.
One of the most noteable features is the Decentralized Board of Trade. The marketplace will have its own token that serves as shares on the network, powered by the **Bitcoin blockchain** using the Omni protocol. Owners of these shares act as watchdogs that can comment and vote on contracts. There is a [crowdsale going on now]( to purchase the shares, and 100% of the funds will go towards funding the development of SafeX.
Although I'm not associated with SafeX, I wanted to share it with everyone here as I think the SAFE Network has extraordinary ramifications for a new decentralized internet. For anyone who's not familiar with it, it is a network whose aim is to create a totally new internet infrastructure that is private, decentralized, and anonymous by default. Any app that you use on the conventional internet (social media, news, streaming, etc) can be built upon the SAFE network. I wrote a fairly detailed description of what it is and how it works [here](
