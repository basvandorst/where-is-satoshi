that's because the US government is run by nazis.   where's the foreign internal defense?

I'm not joking.  The business plot, prescott bush, operation paperclip, ,JFK, 1000 nazis used in cold war, second reichstag fire, second enabling act, seconed homeland security.   couldn't be more obvious nazi.  they overtly support nazis in ukraine and whereever else nazis are to be found.  enough.

too easy to hack and spoof.   that's why retina scans will be mandatory.

we'll see how they implement it.  apple will not pay you in bitcoins.   dollars are unlmited supply but bitcoins aren't.  it's going to be a race to hoard.

My Fibonacci projection analysis of the bitcoin candlestick charts indicates it should fall to about $250 over the next several weeks/few months.  Do you agree?  
Also, what specific encryption problems does bitcoin solve?  is it essentially crowdsourced encryption cracking?

not sure I understand.   how would that compare to say using crowdsourcing to crack encryption?

looks like it's about to come down a fair bit.

the Bilderbergers decide you can pay in bitcoins, but you can't get paid in bitcoins.  you'll get paid in taxable dollars.   nice way to collect all the bitcoins.

Instead of buying bitcoin, I think they would be wiser to institute their own digital currencies of scale.   AFAIK control of money supply can't be achieved with bitcoins, or gold

there's a bite taken out of it for a reason.
