Switch your client to display in uBTC and call them "you bits" - bits for short. One million bits per coin.
Today's rate: 2000 bits for a buck.

You may be right. Personally, I find µBTC an undesirable label.
I just wanted to see what it takes to modify the Bitcoin Core [code]( to effectuate the change. I don't think the "computer literates" have anything to worry about.

Set your client to display uBTC and call them "bits". Done.

From now on, whenever I upvote a post I'll also 2 bits. Might have to change my name to 2-bit-tipper.

Feel free to call them mirco-bitcoins as its the scientifically correct name. Using uBTC does not conflict with mBTC. Although, I think the use of mBTC was short sighted as it will become too large a denomination in a couple of years. 
Just like the US Dollar can be called a "buck", I'll be calling a micro-bitcoin a "bit". Today's rate: 2,200 bits for a buck.

No. You don't buy a car for 30 kilo dollars. Basketball players don't make 20 mega dollars a year.
We don't &amp; haven't used SI notation for money - ever.

Requires a couple changes to bitcoinunits.cpp: ~~
