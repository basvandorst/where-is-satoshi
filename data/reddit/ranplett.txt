Huh? Are you drunk?
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:31:27
Damn, these guys just can’t let go.
If you have invested $1000, it drops to $100, and you invest $9000 more, your $9100 now has an _opportunity_ to increase or decrease losses, based on a future earnings variable, but that’s about it.
And if you’ve already lost 90% you should probably consider investing somewhere else. That scenario is highly unlikely as well, because most guys blow their load all in one shot.

It looks like he articulated his position really well. Your response is the real waste of time here.
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:26:29
you lack basic understanding of logic. I suppose based on that, 50% of my posts get deleted, right?

Love it. I’ve been everywhere. It’s great if you can get freshly harvested coffee in Oaxaca, or freshly roasted chocolate in Tabasco, or juicy tree ripened mangos from the market. Downside: they seem to treat dogs like crap. They don’t take them for walks and keep them in little cage like areas far too small for them. They end up going loco. You walk down the sidewalk and dogs jump at you and scare the ever lovin shit out of you.
@_date: 2018-03-11 06:27:54
Yeah but you’re still taking on far more risk. You can also lose insane amounts of money.

Yup spend my winters here. Love it. Far better than Van(couver) in the winter. I eat lots of raw fruit, so it works out quite well.

That’s how I feel about real estate. Never sell. Do you have positions in any other coin?
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:38:03
How is it struggling? People are doing great here. I’ve traveled all over the country, my biggest complaints are how dogs are treated (absolutely disgusting), unclean water, and rarely some foodsafe issues. Otherwise it’s a paradise. I’ve also traveled extensively through about 22 countries, and this place is particularly hard on dogs. I’ve never been to China or Russia tho. You sound like a ignorant American that watches too much Fox News

Are you suggesting we sell everything and buy dogecoin?
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:16:03
“But on the dips” lmao. More like “sell on the peaks.”
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:17:18
I may be wrong, but it could go up. However, it could also go down, though I could be wrong as well. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:19:49
Mug? What type of lambo is that?
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:51:26
Buying on the dips works great for a solid company trending upward like AMZN or ADBE.
If BTC is trending down so hard as it has in the last three months, the better advice would be the opposite: sell on the peaks.
That way your funds aren’t locked up and you can take advantage of better buying opportunities.
Following bad advice of emotional newb traders whom repeats “buy on the dip” ad nauseum is like the blind leading the blind.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:18:03
Sell on the peaks! Sell on the peaks!
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:56:59

“Buying on the dips” haha. What about selling on the peaks?

you’ve been to Mexico? Woah you explorer you. I just closed on fairly sizeable chunk of land here. Business is booming as far as I can tell. “No poor people” lol. Retarded.

Not to mention I get 1 year of extended warranty on purchases and cell phone loss / damage / theft coverage with my CC. Also, flight insurance coverage, travel health insurance, car rental damage insurance (which saves me a fortune), etc. Also, I get 1% cashback and put that in a tax sheltered account. And I don’t have to sign up to coinbase.
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:15:31
Yeah because I’m the one who likes to diss poor people in Mexico. Have you ever been to towns like Coos Bay, OR, or Uereka, CA? It’s like the fucking twilight zone man. I’d live in Mexico any day over the USA unless I really like shopping or financial opportunities.

Repeating HODL ad nauseum is just a way to calm the intense amount of fear and buyer’s remorse around here. Smart investors just hold their position and follow their plan. Weak investors gotta yap and chirp and say HODL
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:50:36
Yup. I’ve got some dry pow and the thought of gambling it in BTC scares the shit out of me
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:44:12
I walk down the street in my gf’s neighbourhood, and these ugly ass looking pit bulls scare the ever loving fuck out of us literally slamming their faces into the fence and barking at you really loud. They damage the big metal gates. They were probably really nice dogs at one point, but being locked in tiny cages (a carport) their whole life drives them loco. Drives me nuts too. There are no nice dog parks to take them to, and if they were ever let off leash, they would go kill other little chihuahuas
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:43:11
Be careful. I feel the same and wish I trusted my instincts more. However, confirmation bias basically prevents people from seeing any counter evidence to the process. Yes you’re gut instinct can be very correct at timing entry and exit points, but it can also be very wrong. The human brain tends to ignore those instances in favour of ones that confirm success. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:12:40
There’s no way of knowing anything, but based on trends, it could go as low as $4k. There’s been a lot of good news lately, but what about if some bad news comes along? If I were to guess, I’d say it bottoms at $7k in the short term, works it’s way back up to $9k, and then slides hard down to $4500
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:17:07
Weird. I just talked to him as well and he said it would cross $100k in Dec 2018. Dec. 16th at 4:36pm to be exact. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:58:33
I don’t know why anyone shorts anything. Most you can earn is 100% and that’s if an organization goes bankrupt (highly unlikely). Going long offers far more upside. I’d just be patient and wait for buy signals
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:19:11
Yeah I think the joke is a little over done lately

@_date: 2018-02-28 11:16:33
The patterns are so bloody clear. I’d be watching carefully if it could overcome resistance and even break 11.5k or 12k. But right now it just looks like business as usual. Another double top and then woosh
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:36:33
And then strong fundamentals TOTALLY REDEEM THEMSELVES (dumb and dumber reference)
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:28:56
The last major bubble collapsed to about 20% of the previous ath, which leave us at about $4k. I see that as an incredibly strong support line. So I could see an investment getting no less than halved, and could also see 25k by years end. I’m actually getting a stronger bullish feeling based on the last few weeks. Expected a much worse drop in early March.
@_date: 2018-02-26 07:22:17
The evidence IS the patterns which is a clear indication of market manipulation. He said there are no patterns and that is very much untrue
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:25:14
That system could be used to establish trust, and once buyer / seller are comfortable with each other, they can opt out of that optional system to save transaction costs. Kind of like a “for sale by owner” real estate deal. I think the key issue is trust though, and those provisions are usually absorbed by the vendor, which I’m sure will be the case in a few years from now.
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:55:42
Last major bubble at ~$1150 popped and slowly went down to 1/4 - 1/5 of that value in about a year and a half. That plants BTC right at about $4000 - $5000. It would then take several years to recover once people forget how badly they got burned.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:29:48
There is support over the long term (6 months). If it breaks through lower than ~8k, it probably has further losses ahead, but if it hits support and starts a short term trend upward, it may be a good entry point. If it gains momentum after ~8k that could be a bullish signal that suggests $6k was indeed the bottom.
Obviously no one has a crystal ball, so it’s practically impossible to predict these things. But around the $8k mark should provide some clues.

Fascinating idea. You can get your bots to throw a wrench in the plans of other bots and cash in. Basically manipulating the manipulators.
