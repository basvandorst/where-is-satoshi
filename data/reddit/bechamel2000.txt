Garzik nearly broke Bitcoin late 2017.  His code for the hostile (no replay protection) hardfork segwit2x had bugs in it.   He's a well known person in crypto only because he has been around a long time.
From memory satoshis 'number 2' was Nick Szabo or Hal  Finney, ... not Garzik.

Also, so Roger Ver could have his own coin.  He realised he couldn't own or drive Bitcoin and this hurt his ego.   He even referred to it as "my project".  He's probably genuinely  convinced himself that he's doing the right thing, because no one wants to believe they are just a greedy egotistical person.

No .. It's effectively POS

Lightning network... you say it's coming out later this year.  Where did you get this information?   Will this be a full release, open to the general public?  It's in alpha at the moment so I don't see how it can make it through beta and multiple release candidates by the end of the year.   :-(
Lightning adoption.  I think because of the dramatically cheaper fees, adoption after general release will be more rapid than a year.   Users will demand lightning from their exchanges and their wallets providers because of the fee savings.  Those slower in offering lightning will be abandoned or only  used by people who don't mind wasting money (the minority).
I am looking into running a lightning node and experimenting with it.  Have you done this?

Where can I get the actual facts about the level of support?  Is it tracked or recorded anywhere?   The stats I read are so diametrically opposed.

It will crash.  And it will rocket up too.  Not sure in what order.
It will go up to $23,541

But seriously...  Buy it now.  Even if it suffers a big  correction,  it will go up eventually.
Do you need the $300 for anything "real"?  Like food or toothpaste?   If so, don't invest in BTC.

You have the hard drive that the doc was stored on?  It is possible to do undelete on filesystems but it all depends on how much you have used the drive since and a certain level of luck.
Look for undelete programs 
Good luck.

I politely suggest you do some more research in crypto before investing.   Or ... if you really wouldn't miss the $300 ... just buy it, and do some research into how to store it safely.

Hi,  when and where do your 2 lines meet?
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:41:48
Yes.  Search for "undelete Windows 7" or whatever your operating system is.
