Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.

I’m not sure about that. You set the entire fee, not the value per byte. It’s either 0 or the `txminrelayfee` which is definitely less than 1/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:22:06
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:19:48
Not at all. If your transaction has e.g. 3 inputs, you essentially need to pay double fee for the same confirmation time. If you don’t have an unspent input of $150, more inputs get included. So it’s not unlikely that your $15 fee counts as $7 or $5 fee, which normally takes days.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:52:14
That requires you to send a transaction for every mined block. If you don’t send transactions constantly you won’t catch every pause so it will take you longer than 4 days on average.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:12:38
Hmm, that’s fair.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:24:25
No, I don’t think that applies, the block is full. They include these particular 1000, because they are extremely high-fee and they don’t include more because there’s no more space in the block.

Mining in one paragraph: There’s one value in the block that doesn’t have to follow any rules, a garbage value called "nonce". Miners are free to change it to whatever they want without modifying the rest of the block. To "solve" a block, they have to try different nonce values until they find one that makes the block valid, forcing the hash of the block into the acceptable range.
Simplified: A problem that miner has to do is to roll a random number between 0 and 2^256. They can’t influence the outcome, and it takes a constant amount of time. If the number they rolled is too large, they have to roll again. Difficulty is simply defined by what is "too large" and what is "small enough". The threshold number is called the target, and it’s reversely proportional to the difficulty. 45000 is twice easier than 22500.
So the difficulty changes how likely you are to **win** after solving the problem **once**, not how complex is the problem.
Currently the chance is about 1 out of 10 quintillion (10 billion trillion), so you have to "solve" the same problem 10 quintillion times on average to solve it once.

Miners choose whether to confirm transactions, most will probably stop, but there will be a subset of miners who won't stop, so technically yes, it will work fine, but with more delay. There's something called minimum relay fee in all nodes, transactions must have like 0.1 sat/b, but that's still almost zero.

No, it only has to be less than the target, no  second boundary. You can't go for the smallest value because you provide the nonce, which is used to find out the target you hit. It's like you need to make a world in minecraft, and every block is a completely new version of Minecraft, so you have to look for the seed all over again. The target always means the same thing (e.g. a total number of trees) but every block completely scrambles the correspondence between the seed and the world.

As far as I know, every time that happens the network is split in two. Literally, some of the nodes disagree with others on what is Bitcoin.

You need huge investments, around $10,000, and it’s risky even then.

How long is recently? Why is that?

No, I don’t think so.

I don’t know much about scrypt, but seems like it’s not.
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:31:07
The difficulty *is* the number of shares needed, on average.
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:09:17
it feels great, try it sometime
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:45:02
It has to be 317, the bottom is a prime number.
@_date: 2014-10-09 18:55:22
Maybe there is a Rainmeter widget?
@_date: 2014-06-15 06:29:36
So it can be set to a lower share difficulty.
@_date: 2014-08-02 00:13:09
I'm still seeing genuine grief. Nevermind, must be on my end.
@_date: 2014-06-22 13:22:34

“ a last way to get out of work”? What?
@_date: 2014-08-04 11:17:33
You should tell other people not to use it, with a smug expression.

I bet it was 1000 bits (gasp!)
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:41:57
How is it removing uncertainty? Instead of a fixed, easily calculateable reward, the income depends on the amount of BTC moved around.
Another point, unless you’re making some amount of micro-hashes mandatory (e.g. at least 100 small miners must contribute to a block), you’re essentially discarding the work they do (it doesn’t matter if people micro-mine or not, the difficulty stays the same).
@_date: 2014-11-26 07:07:03

I know someone like that.  
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:06:18
You’re right, you will technically make less, but it’s like 0.01% with a huge pool like GHash.
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:10:31
OK, you are smarter.
@_date: 2014-12-03 08:08:30
The opposite. Lower hashrate means longer confirmation, lower difficulty = faster confirmation. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:16:09
What’s that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2014-06-11 18:18:41
You can’t ensure that there’s no cheating. Bitcoin will always be a fertile ground for that :D
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:22:27
Either it goes to the original pool or it gets destroyed. There is no other option.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:47:31
~~Why does it have to be Ghash? All pools would benefit from Elegius losing “customers”. What am I missing?~~
Nevermind, I see it. When someone leaves Elegius they don’t choose at random, they pretty much definitely go to Ghash.

That’s a magnificent pussy.

Sick product of an artificial brain; didn’t read:
— The Ministry of Finance suggests to ban the use and the issuing of cryptocurrency by 2016. They have already talked with FSB and CBRF and decided on some “concrete measures”.  
— The Central bank of Russian Federation has warned that buying or selling cryptocurrency can be regarded as potential involvement in money laundry. That's old news from January.
RBC is a legitimate source as far as I know.
@_date: 2014-06-14 07:05:03
“51% attack” doesn’t sound scary. It’s not like “Kwisatz Haderach” or “Sapir-Whorf hypothesis”.

Please make some corrections.
@_date: 2014-07-16 09:06:26
Presumably people will stop using the current Bitcoin protocol before that happens (the reward is to stay above 0.00001 until 2100). A lot can change in 90 years.

No, it’s not accurate because pools can be lucky or unlucky. The difficulty not changing is not the factor.
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:10:44

Not that I know of.
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:30:00
It will take like 100 years, it doesn’t make any sense to me that the current protocol is unchanged for that long. Realistically we drop Bitcoin before the last coin is mined.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:48:51
Why does it bother you specifically?
@_date: 2014-06-16 13:45:50
@_date: 2014-07-26 09:25:06
It could be either, there’s no telling.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:53:24
If you’re using a real wallet, yes. If it’s an online service, they may credit it if they want to.
@_date: 2015-05-14 11:18:11
I don't see the contradiction, sorry.
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:53:02
I can only say why Bitcoin is a loser right now. It’s a paid service, so only rich people can afford it, and it’s centralized, so only pro-China people will buy it.

A definition is a type of rule.
@_date: 2017-03-11 12:29:45
I’m talking about transaction fees.

Things like these: [one]( [two](
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:32:08
It shows 232 inputs, which is the reason I suppose.
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:39:25
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:37:40
A significant drop in trading volume in this case doesn’t imply a significant drop in transactions. Exchanges are off the network.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:52:25
They made a rule that the first block must be larger than 1 MB to make it invalid on the old chain. Maybe they didn’t think it through or maybe that’s a good way to go about it, I don’t know.

BCC doesn’t accept regular Bitcoin transactions, they have a separate mempool.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:14:33
If one is `141`, `148` or `*91` (18 total), and the other is `bcc` or `*ec` (17 total) that’s 1 out of 54827.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:02:24
You won’t lose bitcoincash if you sell after the fork is activated. If you buy bitcoin after the fork is activated, you won’t get any bitcoincash. Buy before the fork, sell after the fork.

Are you mad? It can’t be less than 14 tx per block.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:16:13
That’s already implied. I’d have to double the chance if they could go in that order.
@_date: 2018-10-16 10:38:56

@_date: 2017-08-01 17:17:35
It’s 7000 transactions.

Gotcha, thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:42:23
We did. Bitcoin Cash is not synced to BTC. They are mining on top of a different block.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:12:04
That’s not going to change after the 1st block.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:58:23
~~Sorry what?~~ Oh right, `*****bcc`.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:47:02
Love it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:33:53
Just think about it, the BCC nodes have stopped syncing to the btc blockchain (that’s not obvious, I assume  is correct). The only way to lose BCC from moving BTC is through transaction replay, BCC is protected from replay.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:15:11
A business would be more likely to see a direct benefit from helping the network, if they are actually **making money** from Bitcoin. A Bitcoin user is **paying** for the service, so they may see it fair to not contribute in any other way.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:24:57
The addresses that have always been empty are not on the blockchain. You’ll have a “list” of addresses that were used.
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:31:13
Is [localbitcoins]( hard to use in US?
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:58:32
If you sent btc after the fork, you still have the alt coin. Your concern sounds like you *received* btc after the fork.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:16:50
It’s possible that they haven’t made the transaction yet, waiting to send multiple transactions in a batch. There’s nothing you can do in that case.
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:51:49
What do you mean why?
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:34:48

You just sounded like an automoderator. "Your post has been selected for a "mining is pointless on a cpu" response because we detected the word "CPU" in your title. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.*"
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:02:36
The adjustment is usually done when a block is mined, not between blocks.

@_date: 2017-08-15 22:54:45
Is it all capitals?
@_date: 2016-11-27 15:54:09
That’s correct, although as far as I know the armed conflict already ended.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:04:04
The split is done. It’s already too late to move bitcoin to your wallet, and it’s safe to move it out. No need to wait for the 1st block as far as I understand.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:22:36
Yes, it’s safe.
@_date: 2016-11-27 15:38:27
There was a war in eastern regions of Ukraine quickly after the annexation of Crimea, easy to get them confused.
@_date: 2016-12-09 14:12:11
Yeah, that’s not a guarantee anymore. If you’re not using mixers you’re tracked. If you’re paying fees you’re financing the Chinese business.
@_date: 2016-12-09 14:05:01
That was true 4 years ago, when it was free to use, so there was no doubt you’re not financing corruption directly. You are actually paying now.
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:25:50
You can't get a live one, only an approximation. 
 is the approximate interval between blocks. Difficulty times 2^32 divided by the interval should give you the hashrate (divide again by 1e12 for TH/s and so on).
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:55:35


Sorry? At the moment of writing it’s a paid service.
@_date: 2016-11-03 10:52:32

Oh yeah,  GH/s.
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:16:32
That's for Bitcoin mining. Don't mention Bitcoin when you state the question and you'll get different answers.

There’s no reason to do that, so nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:33:43
having a list of all adresses would be impossible, too much data
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:18:28
Surely you can put any limit on your own mempool?
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:20:03
They are way way way way too similar to tell.
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:22:25
You are applying conventional logic to magic smoke money.  
In this world, you lose all your stakes when you do that.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:46:48
There shouldn't be anything about this transaction that makes it better to spam the network with. You can't cheat the fees. What do you see in it?

Yes. In theory any transaction can be confirmed several years later, you can’t cancel it, only invalidate by spending the coins.


All coins are distinguishable for this case, the transaction points exactly at the outputs you want to spend. After the new transaction clears no coins can be spent by the old transaction, but you need to spend at least some of the coins used in the old transaction, and it’s possible to accidentally make them independent even when spending from one address.
So yes, that’s a real possibility.

No other mechanisms, if the hashrate drops, the difficulty stays high for 20 (40, 50...) days.
Worse, if the hashrate is less than 25% of nominal it will take more than one adjustment, so for 10% it's 140 days + 35 days before the difficulty adjusts completely.

They would have to pay 8 times larger than normal fee because of that. There's just no difference between that transaction and 8 smaller transactions. I'm afraid I still don't understand where you're coming from.
The fee is always scaled with the size.

There's probably a trick to make them reappear. Because in Core it's as simple as `abandontransaction` AFAIK.

No, in that case they can’t.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:58:34
If the hashrate is 1/10 of the necessary, it would take 140 days before the adjustment hits (simply 14 times 10). But the difficulty can't drop by more than 75% in one adjustment, it's one of the rules. So after one adjustment we will only have 4/10 of the necessary hashrate and it would take 35 days for the second one.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:24:32

Well, *the required number of confirmations* is not a single number, it’s just what **they** think is fair. An exchange can ask for 3 confirmations when accepting BTC, but 10 confirmations when accepting LTC, and be justified (lower hashrate **and** faster blocks equal more risk).
Apart from that you’re very much correct.

Your estimate is both optimistic and pessimistic. Withdrawal and deposit can be done simultaneously (your wallet will let you spend unconfirmed incoming coins), so it won’t take the time×2  
However, the exchange likely won’t let you trade after just one confirmation, especially in the case of LTC.

Miners get the same reward for empty blocks versus the ones with transactions! If the miners were motivated by the reward only, you wouldn’t get any transactions right now. The mining fee is a separate bounty.
Not to mention that one CPU is pretty much enough for the entire mining. It would easily process 3−5 transactions and the 7 million hashes per second. As long as Greg keeps the computer on, we’re doing great.

There’s no Poisson distribution in difficulty adjustments. It will take twice as long to get 2016 blocks starting with the moment the miners leave, but nobody cares about that. There aren’t 2016 timeframes going on simultaneously, there’s just one. Like, at any point there can be 100 blocks until adjustment, or 10 or 1, not 2016 every time. You are clearly making an argument for an entirely different question (how many seconds will pass until the next block).

tl;dr No the supply rate is not increasing, it’s just high, which is different
You are right that the supply rate is higher than nominal every time the difficulty goes up. It’s not increasing because that happens consistently, it’s almost always between 0 and +20%, the first derivative is relatively “flat”. It’s been like that for years. There’s no reason why the market should react, if nothing unusual is happening. 
If the supply rate really was increasing, the [percentages at the bottom]( would be going up.
Personally I don’t believe that supply affects the price enough to care about it, although I probably don’t understand economics enough. Isn’t it like 5% per year? Why would that be noticeable?
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:48:39

B (0.14| →  |black hole |→| E (0.8)|

All inputs are spent, the change goes back to you (ABCF all belong to the same person), and the amount that isn’t declared as an output will be claimed as mining fee.

It’s hard to organize people to do arbitrary things. With our current system you don’t have to convince people that you know what you’re doing, you just pay them money and they do whatever you want, so we get things like iPhones, where thousands of people are working on different parts of it, that only make sense as a whole. If there’s no money you have to convince people using something else (promises, reputation, arguments). It makes things more structured and rigid, which can be seen as an upside but can be argued to actually make things more chaotic in the long run. With money, you don’t need a central authority or an ideology, people just kinda do whatever pays and that works out.
Money is like democracy, it looks insane, but that’s just because it gives structure to the normal insanity that already exists.

@_date: 2017-07-21 15:57:09


But that’s pointless? Your hardware wallet works just fine in case of a chain split.
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:29:26
If a non-bip141 block was mined it would be accepted by Core and UASF, so no reorganization means no blocks.
@_date: 2015-03-20 11:14:43
I find this hard to believe.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:19:42
I’m guessing that when the pool hashrate rises, it generates a lot of traffic, which they don’t want to deal with. They raise the share difficulty to reduce the traffic, which makes the chart look that way.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:48:40
No one is responsible for processing a transaction, it's always a voluntary process, like adopting an animal from a shelter. Transactions are public, no "server" is responsible for certain transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:30:10
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:04:24
You don’t specifically need a paper wallet. Electrum works just fine. Any actual wallet works just fine.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:23:26
Doesn't work like that. The server is responsible for showing you your current balance, it doesn't handle the transactions you make.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:19:39
That’s your change address.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:15:40
Maybe the pool tweaked the stratum difficulty? Or just messed with the chart settings. It’s normal anyway.

It doesn’t have to be him though. You’re a better candidate IMO.
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:16:46
The $55 got split into 3 parts: the fee, the $5 and the change. The change is transferred back to one of your addresses. Note that it says "Estimated BTC Transacted 	$ 4.96". The explorer successfully guessed which part was supposed to be sent to another wallet. I don't know how it does that, maybe it guesses wrong sometimes.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:55:27
It's the opposite of a sell in a sense.
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:15:21
Any source?
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:10:58
It’s not even the main point of confusion. You’re suggesting more miners as a way to speed up transaction processing. The difficulty adjusts so that any amount of processing power makes the same amount of blocks. More miners or less miners. Any number equals any other number. The backlog just can’t be processed any faster (or slower).
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:44:20

Why would anyone *think* that? Gambling is awesome.

I'm guessing it's because the red area was growing when the price was 1200. 1200 times 1.3 ≈ 1600. It's a rough estimate.

You should try and get the wallet.dat back with an uneraser program or whatever.

xbt is a different less relevant countdown.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:28:08
There are two problems, fees and spending less than a cent. You can exchange dollars to vietnamese dong, 1 satoshi is ~0.5 dong. Payment is solved. The minimum fee is 0.01 sat/byte as far as I know, that’s 3 satoshi. So you can’t use standard transactions. You can buy 1 satoshi at the cost of 4.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:58:44
BIP148 and UAHF. No legacy chain.
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:26:39
You could send all the remaining balance to yourself with a fee that would cover both transactions ($3−$5 probably). It could potentially bump your first transaction’s priority. I’m not sure if it works.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:45:40
The old chain probably. They are initially stuck together, so when you move them on either chain the other moves as well. A chain split doesn’t immediately “split” the coins but you do get an equal amount on the other chain.
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:10:34
No matter which wallet you use, you will not lose any coins, including any potential splits as long as you don’t send or receive. Only people who keep their balance with third parties are at risk.
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:12:18
It will follow the trend.

A wallet generator is not an online wallet. It essentially picks a random entry from directory.io and prints it.
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:55:52
Did you send it to your own wallet or to someone else? Do you have any bitcoin left on the blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:25:12
Of course.
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:55:18
$1 for 10 days, $5 within 1 day.

@_date: 2017-06-05 10:10:54
And do you have any left?
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:38:07
According to this, a standard node wouldn’t accept a zero-fee transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:26:27
A transaction will “land” separately (two times). When it gets approved twice you can withdraw both.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:03:05
I guess pretending to miss the point is always an option.
@_date: 2017-07-08 04:43:00
That’s what I’d use.
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:44:39
Yeah it shouldn’t affect things. The unconfirmed transactions will get lost but that’s not a big deal.
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:28:25
The main risk is that you can’t trust the coins you receive during the split to exist on both chains, so buy all you can before the split and keep them in your own wallet. You may run UASF or an old wallet it doesn’t matter.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:40:35
Yeah, I see it now.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:48:42
~~Usually you have several addresses. One of the outputs is yours, you simply don’t recognize it.~~
I don’t get it.
@_date: 2017-06-28 12:27:15
You use a program that searches for the address that contains the characters you want. 
So you type e.g. “winter”, it takes a couple hours to generate a million addresses until it finds one and then it gives you the private key:

@_date: 2017-06-08 21:24:50
The 1st of August is the split date. Segwit won’t even be locked in at this point. Are you assuming bitstamp will support the alternative chain?
@_date: 2017-06-10 09:04:59
You can simply make a deposit before the split and withdraw it twice after. Anyway it’s about splitting the coins, you don’t require a service to start owning coins on the other side of the chain, legacy coins are automatically copypasted over.
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:39:40
Yeah, you’ll be fine.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:32:09
The difficulty can retarget to a lower value but it doesn't happen immediately (the more adjustment is needed, the slower it happens). It can take a full month before any adjustment happens.
So yes and no. The difficulty adjusts but for a while one chain will be faster.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:14:03
Yes, the price will change just like it does on the website.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:22:58
Are you saying the miners only approve high fees, plus some insignificant amount of lower fees to hide the fact, and fill the rest of the block with fake transactions to hide it further? The drama!
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:19:25
Never will.
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:01:00
My connection is around 5 MB/s, took me a couple nights.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:05:41
You’ll have to wait until there’s a splitting service apparently. I won’t be able to sell you any without losing my legacy coins.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:50:01
Oh I forgot about minimum output which is something like 5460, but I’m not sure about that.
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:08:23
The coins that were already in your posession are guaranteed to double, no action required. The payments after the split are not guaranteed to be two-sided, although there won’t be an easy way to send a one-sided payment (you either send two transactions or none). There may be services that allow you to split your coins so that you get more control over them (you will need to use it whenever you have unsplit coins).
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:42:08
To make the system resistant to attacks I guess. Protect it from hacking and spam. They have a lot of things to figure out still.
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:20:47
Some of the contracts were made around the price point of 1200, we just assume that some means most.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:41:39
Yes. They are as good as erased.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:34:11
That would be a third transaction. Does cpfp work across 3 transactions?
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:59:09
That’s correct but when you spend either coin the transaction will have a large chance of confirming twice, so you lose the coins you didn’t intend to spend. You have to keep that in mind if you have a mindset of having two different coins.
@_date: 2013-04-20 04:01:55
The graph is hard to read, what can I do to see it clearer?
edit: Apparently it only works with default zoom.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:49:28
Sending the entire balance should cost less in theory because there is only one output.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:35:45
The output is spent, so someone has definitely received it. They are either lying or have given you the wrong address.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:30:42
When you buy you pay the price of the cheapest seller. When you sell you get the price of the most generous buyer. The bids are simply sorted by “generosity” and you see the first one.

5 MH/s is nothing.
Edit: Slush has a policy of sending your reward in portions of at least 0.05 ฿. Unless you’re underestimating your hashrate you’ll need roughly a year of casual mining to get any of your bitcoins. 10 years, if the difficulty growth is accounted for.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:31:26
The combined fee is 57 sat/b, so there’s twice as much hope.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:45:59
They won’t be synced. You’ll just have two different addresses with the same name.

It’s clearly just a wording mistake. Instead of talking about number of transactions, I was talking about the linearly growing transaction *rate*. See [this comment](

The miners will still receive their reward from the network, in the form of transaction fees, rather that minted coins.

Let’s say there’s three guys in the whole world. There’s a spammer, he spends 1 bitcoin per block to fill it with garbage, there’s a rich man who sends 20 kb of transactions per block, and a poor man who also needs 20 kb per block. The rich man can outbid the spammer paying 0.02 in fees, the poor man can’t. If we increase the blocksize 1000 times, the blocks are still full but the poor guy can outbid the spammer now. How can you argue with this?
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:38:04

I think I get it.
@_date: 2013-05-04 07:15:41
One possible explanation is that you saved up those 1.5 BTC in small increments (by mining, gambling etc.), while spending some small amount every time you gained money, “celebrating” the income.
This way your money would get dispersed between tens or hundreds private addresses (as [change]( making for an enormous transaction: the fee is **per kilobyte**. You may consider using Electrum, or some other client that lets you set the fee below 0.0005 if this is the case.
