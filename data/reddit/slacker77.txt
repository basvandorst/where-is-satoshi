He he... nope. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:48:31
Haven't used Kraken for many years now. I used it in the early days when I first hear about Bitcoin. Nowadays I mainly use Bitstamp.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:45:06
Just returned home. Hmmm, guess I failed. ��

First rule is always: Only invest money you can afford to lose.
Second: You will regret if you sell it now. HODL!
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:35:29
Looks like it...
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:00:26
GreenAddress.it is a good Segwit wallet. Not really easy to use, but it's a good wallet with many options.
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:55:32
If you have connections it's working.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:35:15
Indeed... 
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:58:12
Me? I use segwit wallets. ;-P
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:51:32
Lol.... :-) It will take a whole long day of shopping then I guess. ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:02:06
Would be nice to see the price go up a little again.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:46:06
Yeah, me too! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:17:30
I was already wondering what just happened. I left home to do some shopping 1 hour ago. It was right under 15k. Looking at the price when I got home it was almost 16k. Wow.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:52:24
Bitstamp is over 16k.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:20:14
I have a Pi 2 running as a full node here for over a year and it runs just fine. No issues with it at all and have 60+ connections. I don't see the problem.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:49:06
I am a really happy user of Bitstamp.
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:17:26
Who knows... :-) You never know. However, every januari Bitcoin dips and goes back up later in the year. So i am not really that worried.
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:34:37
Ok, I will. Thanks man! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:34:07
Korea is not banning it. It's China now. Atleast it looks like they want to ban the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:44:00
Wow! Awsome car! Congratulations!
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:52:18
Ok, I have to admit. After seeing the first Youtube video's I was a little skeptical. But after having tested it, I am actually really impressed. It easy to use and works excellent.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:57:33
Hmmm... that's strange. Have two transactions open that have above 100sat/b and still are not confirmed:
Am I looking at it wrong or is there something else wrong with these transactions? Had 3 more transactions that day with each 121sat/b per transaction and they all went through already.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:12:40
So far it is! :-) It's going in the good direction.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:09:32
You have a point there. Thanks for pointing it out!
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:23:00
Hopefully it will work easy when it’s finally released. We have to wait and see I guess. In early days if I internet, people did not understand it either.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:54:17
Congratulations! 
I never regret selling some of my coins to buy myself or family something nice! Enjoy it man! Happy for you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:08:36
Thanks, I will check it out and start my Android simulator. Have no Android devices in house. I'm an Apple fanboy. ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:36:13
I understand. But you do hear more and more people about the fees. That's not the best thing. On the other hand, it is what it is, and the demand makes the price go up. So in a certain point, it's good. ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:17:47
Hmmm... I can not do that myself, as it was send from Blockchain.info to my hardware wallet. :-(
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:34:42
Thanks! I noticed they suddenly came through. Thank you!
Could you please help me out one more time? Have 1 more stuck:
Not too much in a hurry, but it would be great if it got through before 2018. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:33:06
I hope it will go up, but see a lot of messages about Bitcoin going down instead. Not sure what will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:08:30
Ah check, hadn't noticed that. Crap. :-) I will look into child pays for parent. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:45:08
I sure hope not. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:54:12
Yeah, definitely is not saying anything.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:56:28
Don't worry. It happened to me often too that I bought at the top. It will always come back up. Focus on the long term, not on the short term.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:09:49
Nice post.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:10:27
I agree it's not the best source for news. It's mostly bashing, even though there are some nice posts to be found in here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:50:10
Ha ha ok. Had no clue. I thought the developers quit. But I guess it's still alive then. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:36:35
That's awesome man! I know how you guys feel, as me and my wife has issues wanting to get a child before too. It all turned out fine eventually. Feel for you and wish you both get to enjoy a new life that is from the both of you!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:34:05
Cool, that’s awesome man! I am really happy to read all the stories here about people being able to pay off their loans and do some extra nice stuff with the money!
Good for you all guys! Never regret and enjoy! You online live once, so you might as well enjoy it the fullest when you can.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:23:23
50 sat/b? Hmmm... ok. Not sure how that happened then. :-( The hat sucks Guess I have to be patient with that transaction then. :-) Not in a hurry, so that is ok.
How did you find the transaction with the input fee of 20 sat/b? I can't seem to find it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:00:54
Yeah, he is looking towards Lightning. He said it will work better on Bcash... So, suddenly it seems he is not about onchain scaling anymore?!
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:13:24
Half year? Hmmm... Personally I was hoping it would come a little faster. But understand the fact they want to test it really well.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:28:43
Dude, you are awsome! Thank you so very much for your help! No idea how you do it, but I am really happy with it!
Merry Christmas and a happy new year to you too!
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:34:59
I have no idea actually. I think there will not be any limits?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:44:57
I understand. Hopefully some news about it will be shared soon.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:54:54
I only looked at the paid service. Perhaps I can give that a try. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:22:25
My sending wallet says it's send and only not confirmed. So it's not being rejected by the network (yet).
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:52:40
Best reaction ever from the community, after he got bitched by a former Bitcoin supporter publicly on Twitter.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:18:39
I am in no hurry at all. Just wondered why my coins never showed up. Thought I lost them. But I guess I have to be patient now. Never had this happen before, so wasn’t actually sure what was happening.
Thanks for explaining. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:09:14
Lol, in 2018... when in 2018? December? What a shitty statement.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:38:13
When my Bitcoins reach 4 million dollars, I will take some gains. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:57:05
What I was also surprised about is that he now states that Lightning Network will work better on Bitcoin Cash in the future. He was always talking about onchain scaling to be better, etc. etc. And now he says that???
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:56:12
Ha ha lol. I thought Dogecoin was dead. But I guess it's not? :-)
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:48:13
If it reaches that point. I will sell half my coins. 1.000.000 is definitely my moon.!
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:52:16
Well so far they do a good job. Lot of parties are accepting it now and more to come. I do find the use of the Bitcoin name is not correct though. Still do prefer Bitcoin (core), but I am kinda worried about the fees right now and hopefully it will not be a problem for too long now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:59:28
Yes. You can hear it clearly.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:56:50
Lol, me too! ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:08:50
Ah cool! Thanks for pointing me to that wallet. I haven’t heard of it.”, so I will most definitely will check it out. How it works sounds pretty good.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:56:11
That sucks! Not a good thing that party’s like Steam are not longer offering it. :-(
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:07:06
Your welcome. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:02:59
Still more then $ 1000 rise a month average this year. 
Not worried at all. Just hodl!
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:49:26
Trying to move my funds out of blockchain.info, but according to the wallet 180sat/b is not enough to move my funds. :-s Crazy... Something is really wrong with that wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:38
YeS I am. Price going up a little ok. But this is insane and scary!
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:49:33
I agree with you here. I was expecting something different from Lightning, but then again, I did not do my research.
Looking at how it will work now, it seems not like a really easy to use solution. Having to add bitcoin to a lighting wallet, before making a connection and doing the transfer. I would like to be able to scan a QR code and just send it from my main wallet, like how it all works now.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:07:51
Lol. I was afraid about something like that. I just tried again, and failed again.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:30:12
Thanks for the response. Well explained and hopefully company's will implement Segwit and Lightning soon.
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:58:25
They have a partnership with Hut8 mining that is setup by Marc van der Chijs (famous entrepreneur). From what I read, it's a good stable company.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:04:34
I will still have coins left. :-) Not going to cash out everything. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:43:13
Well the dact he is excited is a good start! ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:25:05
Congratz and welcome to the club! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:04:17
I tried it just now at the top of the clock and, but I get the notify "Submissions are beyond limit. Please try later.". Guess I have to try it later. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:21:54
Yeah, guess you have a point there. :-) Have multiple wallets too. Use my iOS wallet for small storage and my hardware wallet for long term storage.
@_date: 2018-09-14 14:34:22
Looks a lot better that way. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:15:53
Hmmm. I have some transactions stuck for a longer period then that. Accelerators ask way too much. It's not reasonable anymore. :-( $160 in total for two transactions of a total of $12 is crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:39:42
Lol, indeed! Good buying opportunity!
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:53:02
Oh yes! Ordered the Trezor T in the first batch. Hoping to get it in January. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:09:17
Not really... I think ViaBTC is trying to make some nice money out of it. :-(
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:25:34
Thanks for explaining. I guess I have to sit this one out then. I send the coins from my Blockchain.info wallet to my Ledger Nano S. Blockchain.info does not allow a replace by fee, etc. So, I guess I just have to wait then. Hopefully the transaction will get through sooner or later. I am not in a hurry. :-)
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:32:35
Good for you man. Your wife is a hodler! ;-)
Luckily I don't have to lie of hide it from my wife. She knows exactly what I put in Bitcoin and she really doesn't care. :-) As long as the bills get paid every month, she's fine with it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:40:47
Yeah, hear it too! It's still in there...
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:04:48
Yes, I know. But it has taken an awful long time. :-(
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:47:57
Having issues myself too. When I try to use a regular fee (180 satoshi per byte) the wallet says it's not the minimum required. :-s Minimal satoshi is 91... Something is wrong with the wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:32:10
Good for you! Congrats!
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:50:36
Did not get a notice about it. Normally I see the link is posted notice.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:59:59
It's still there. Turn up the volume and you can hear it clearly.
@_date: 2018-08-20 14:14:36
And Still they don’t implement Segwit.
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:12:39
Does anyone here know how you can setup the pi so that the output of the Raspibolt command is displayed and updated on the LCD? RaspiBlitz has this, and I would like to see this on my own node too.
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:06:30
There is a guide with image ready based on this tutorial too:
@_date: 2018-08-26 12:59:11
I Raspberry Pi hardly uses any power. It's really cheap to run it. You are right, the costs are not to consider.
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:15:00
Damn. Whish I had bought Bitcoin back then.
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:43:48
Lol, the guy himself blocks users on Twitter that point out his fraud. Talking about censorship!
Perhaps someone can tell this loser the world is not waiting for him and that not everything can be bought with his money. 
What a loser!
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:34:41
Hopefully it will be over soon. Hard to explain to new users, why it’s so high.
@_date: 2017-02-24 06:42:54
Congrats! A good thing you hold on to it. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:47:34
I know what you mean. Was really happy to see the first test runs on Youtube with Segwit. At that point I noticed the fact there is a big group not wanting it. It's really too bad.
Hopefully there will be a solution soon that will be good enough for everyone. We really need to move forward.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:39:33
@_date: 2017-02-04 11:29:54
Thanks, will give it a read.
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:48:54
Yes I do. From how I see it, it looks like a too complicated solution. I think this is the main reason so many in the community are against it.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:10:56
It runs smooth. Did not have to do any changes at all.
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:02:20
Nice. I have 2 pi 2's at home running Kodi. Works excellent. Really love the pi's.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:07:37
I prefer Exodus(.io)
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:05:42
Thanks! That is a good idea. Will see if I can get it to work like that.
@_date: 2017-02-02 09:08:11
Whoops. See the mistake now. Can't alter the title anymore.
@_date: 2017-02-19 17:27:40
Updated my Raspberry Pi node. Compiled the core and it's running now.
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:41:21
Well, I wonder why we can not have both of best worlds. Block increase and Segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-19 13:44:37
Downloaded RC1 and compiling it already on my Pi. :-)
@_date: 2017-02-04 09:54:01
U can using Blockchain.info wallet. You can Bitcoin from there. Or use Bitstamp when you are in the EU.
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:21:43
I want a solutions that makes everybody or at least the whole community happy, so that we can stop this discussion. It's time to move forward with Bitcoin.
I personally don't care what the solution will be. Segwit, 2MB, a combination or something else. Something just has to happen to move forward.
P.s. I think the complexity of Segwit is why the community does not support it. It's not what I think, want or don't want.
@_date: 2017-02-21 08:09:28
I am getting pretty sick and tired of the debate. BU vs Segwit, etc. 
Why is it so hard to just increase the blocksize to 2MB next to the implementation of Segwit? It's seems the most logical thing to do. Especially now that BU is gainging more and more ground. Before we know it BU will be Bitcoin with a few incompetent developers.
@_date: 2017-02-24 10:38:14
Thanks again for the tip. I got my NAS shared folder mounted and can store the blockchain on the NAS now. :-)
@_date: 2017-02-07 11:48:30
Did you try to recover your wallet with a software wallet on your computer with the 24 word seed?
@_date: 2017-02-26 08:20:24
Same here. Plan A is still my job. Bitcoin is my plan B. Hopefully it will make me financial independent within 10 years or so. :-)
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:04:16


I understand you. Like I said before. For me the solution doesn't matter. I personally am fine with all solutions. I just hope there will come a solution to the whole debate.
And no. I don't want to dismiss or ignore people with a different opinion. If the solution is to keep the blocksize limit in place and find a good solution that will satisfy everyone, I am fine with that. :-)
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:53:06
You have to search  for a software wallet that supports 24 word recovery.
@_date: 2017-02-11 07:49:58
I use an sd card for the operating system and software. The Blockchain is stored on an 128GB USB stick at the moment. When it's full I will probably switch to an bigger USB stick or get a cheap hard disk.
@_date: 2017-02-02 07:15:56
Here is a list of companies that (will) support segwit: 
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:21:42
Wonder how far the price will drop this time...
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:11:25
Nice. I run a full node  0.13.2 using a Raspberry Pi 2. OS: Raspbian with Pixel. And use BitcoinCore QT to run the node. Although I could also run it from te command line, but I like the fact I can see in QT it it's up to date and how many connections I have when I login with VNC to my node. :-)
I run it using a Pi, because of the low power consumption.
@_date: 2017-02-14 18:30:08
Correct. They have a referral program
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:07:15
Over at they are talking about a power outage that took 18 hours. According to them it should be back up soon.
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:02:01
Why should it go down instead of up, what everyone is talking about?
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:13:10
Not my yet... Hopefully I will be in some day. :-) Almost there.
@_date: 2017-03-03 07:58:02
I bought many times too and see it crash not long afterwards. You just have to stay calm. All my bought coins are much higher in value then when in bought them. You just have to be patient.
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:25:40
I can tell you that they are not the only ones...
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:34:01
Here is a good tutorial to setup a node on a pi:
Use it like that myself too.
@_date: 2017-02-11 07:56:21
You can always set the upload limit so you don't upload too much when your bandwidth can not handle it.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:06:45
It says core supports, NOT core devs!
@_date: 2018-10-25 05:57:16
@_date: 2018-10-18 11:45:48
Have the same problem here. Were you able to fix it?
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:24:48
Ah, thanks for clearing that up! Wasn't sure how it works in Australia.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:12:12
Seen 3200 come by on coincap.io! Woohoo!
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:29:50
The transaction came through. :-) Everything is fine again. Didn't know it would be rejected otherwise. I read stories about it being stuck in the network forever. Luckely this is not the case. :-)
@_date: 2017-01-19 08:46:36
Wonder if SegWit is ever going to be activated. Looking at last months statistics it seems it's losing ground while BU is increasing.
It's nice to have so many nodes support SegWit, but in the end it are the miners that have to make the switch. And looking at it now, I don't see the activation happen anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:36:55
Nice! Cloning the code now and will compile it right away. Thanks for posting!
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:31:59
Ouch, that sucks. Hopefully it will go back up again soon.
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:41:02
I love updates. Compiling 0.13.2 right now on my Raspberry Pi. Node will be back up in a few hours. :-)
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:03:26
You have a point there! :-)
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:24:44
That is indeed true. But I guess we also want companies that mine the coins to support it. If they all decide to stop with Bitcoin and mine segwit2x instead, we have a problem.
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:55:42
Still far away from 95%. Wonder if we ever going to reach 95%.
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:34:18
I never set and recuser and rpcpassword. So I don't understand why I get this error. :-)
The node run fine for a few days and then suddenly stopped syncing. Now I get this error after a reboot.
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:32:56
Yes, I downloaded everything according to the instructions. Updated everything before compiling, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:23:55
Thanks for explaining. :-) Makes it more clear now.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:52:18
I store it on my NAS. But you can you use a big USB drive too if you want.
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:15:34
I use a RPi 2. I downloaded the first part with a torrent. And from there on I downloaded the rest. Took a long while, but I wasn't in a hurry. :-)
@_date: 2017-01-29 17:28:16
I sure hope so. It seems like it is taking forever to get bigger blocks.
@_date: 2018-10-18 13:51:46
Thanks. Worked for me. :-)
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:23:46
Nope. It worked fine here. Compiled nicely, although it took a while, and it runs here fine.
Perhaps you can can clone it from Github again and try it again?
Update: did you run autogen.sh before you started compiling?
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:15:32
Ok, I see. thanks. I will contact them then.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:37:54
Not to surprising. They did it before. Looking at the price of Cash going up and the fact there are hardly transactions, it look to me they try to create a full transaction pool. Get the fees up and make look Core bad and make people switch to Cash.
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:24:13
Downloaded core again and reset everything. It's syncing now. Seems to be working for now again. :)
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:22:32
In case of segwit? I don't think so.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:54:48
Yes. I have read it. From what I hear it's about 72 hours. So I guess I have to be patient. :-)
In the mean time I am trying to load it in Electrum. It says is synchronizing. Hopefully it will be done fast and I can try to add more fee. :-)
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:29:24
Thanks man! Nice to see someone actually making sense between all those negative posts.!
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:23:42
We are going to the moon!
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:38:49
Yes, but that was because of many spam Transactions. After Segwit got locked in, fees suddenly dropped. Now they go up the same time BCH is being pumped up in South Korea. Too much coincidence if you ask me. But perhaps I am wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:51:10
That’s true! 
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:47:40
Where does the list come from?
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:18:22
Nice! Good for you. You go girl! ;-)
@_date: 2017-01-19 07:14:19
Yeah. I am kinda concerned. It seems that Segwit will not be activated anytime soon, as it's lost 0.3% last month. Instead of growing, it's losing now. Not sure if it will ever be activated like this.
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:40:32
Strange you ended up with errors. I build it on Raspbian Jessie. No problems with that. Don't know where your build it on, although I don't think that should make a difference.
@_date: 2017-01-17 10:00:55
The script makes it really easy to run a bitcoin node on for example a Raspberry Pi. It downloads the compiled core which will save you a lot of compiling time.
And for those who don't trust it. You can easily see the contents of the install-full-node.sh in an texteditor. You can see exatctly what commands it will run.
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:06:26
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:05:38
So, can you tell me how I can get my transaction unstuck? Will it be removed automatically after a while? Never had this before, so not sure how it works.
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:01:43
No, you don't get paid for running a node. Only miners get paid. But you will help keep the network strong and check transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:01:08
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:41:52
Indeed. According to a Twitter post from Kraken, it can take up to 80 hours before we can dump BCH there.
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:51:59
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:26:19
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:12:19
They can’t 95% of the topics is about Bitcoin and bashing. Just don’t understand why they keep talking about Core as Cash is supposed to be much better. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:11:54
Ok, thanks.
Do you perhaps now if the transaction will be dropped by the network after some time? Or will it stay unconfirmed forever?
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:52:18
Not sure my pi can compile and keep the node up running at the same time. So to be safe, I do it like this. In the meantime I make a copy of the Blockchain so that if something goes wrong after the update and upgrade of the Blockchain I can always restore the latest version I had.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:19:41
Bummer... it’s not animated. ;-)
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:33:03
Safer to move them to a new save address, and then try to claim your BCH coins with your private keys. If you don't do that, you risk someone using your private keys to steal your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:16:07
I downloaded it from  Pulled it in and compiled it myself.
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:02:18
I agree!
In the end, I think the whole debate about scaling sucks big time! People bashing each other, etc, etc. I should really stop. Wish we could all come together and make Bitcoin better. Not fight for the best coin. It doesn’t do anyone any good.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:14:44
Ledger doesn't have the lightning bolt. So I have to import it in to Electrum of wait I guess.
I will try to find out how it works with Electrum tomorrow, if it hasn't gone through tonight.
Thanks again for the help. Please send me your bitcoin address so I can send you a small tip.
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:59:00
Thanks. Going to look into it now
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:13:04
I posted comments like that, but get downvoted really fast.
@_date: 2016-12-22 22:42:21
Thanks for the tip! I will give that a try over the weekend. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:21:06
Not really an attack I think. More of a big problem.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:31:44
Good one... hadn't though about that. Use -j4 now to make it as fast as possible. But I will try your tip the next time!
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:23:46
Thanks for the tip. I tried that, but I only get the see a message that the transaction fee is too low. :-) But that I already now. :-) I can't update it in any way.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:32:35
Ok. I have a hardware wallet. A Ledger Nano. I used the receive option of the ledger wallet and set the amount of bitcoins I want to receive.
Then I opened my Blockchain.info wallet on my phone. I scanned the code that my Ledger Wallet generated. And then send the Bitcoins. 
What I however failed to see is that the transaction fee was set too low. Now the transaction is stuck between my own two wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:09:21
No matter on what side you are of the debate, I liked the fact it was respectful to each other! That is something that I haven’t seen for a while between the groups on both sides.
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:05:42
Wondering if someone can confirm this.
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:56:34
Hmmm. Not sure I am happy about this. Will this be the right step forward? Is locking out segwit2x not bad, looking at the many companies that support it?
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:19:49
Problem is i set my ledger wallet to receive coins. I scanned the code with my blockchain.info wallet. :-( Now it's stuck.
@_date: 2016-12-26 20:02:23
Yes. I just it as a temporary storage for Bitcoin before sending it to my hardware wallet.
You can only not buy and sell Bitcoins using Circle. They partner with Coinbase for it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:27:39
Congratulations! Happy for you. Hopefully one day I can open a topic like this too. ;-)
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:24:46
Thanks! Going to give it a try then
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:59:31
Just look at the market! It's going down already.
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:32:44
Still think it has to do with a lot of the sales. Perhaps the malleability attack on BCC is also a reason.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:57:23
Indeed. Waiting over two hours now for a second confirmation. Really good experience. Love the new coin..... NOT!
The only thing they had to do is fork it right and move the hashpower. Even that, they can’t do!
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:27:16
Agree with you that all this bullshit isn’t doing Bitcoin any good.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:46:19
Thanks man! :-)
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:24:13
You still can. Just hear rumors that they might stop with it, but perhaps I am wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:19:50
Welcome to the club! Congratulations!
@_date: 2016-12-26 20:01:26
That is strange. Perhaps is the location? I installeer Circle just a couple of days ago. I live in Europe and it workshop fine here.
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:24:13
You still can. Just hear rumors that they might stop with it, but perhaps I am wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:37:00
Your contract is not profitable. You should have had notices (by e-mail) before that your contract is not paying for the maintenance fee anymore. I have had them too. 4TH is just not enough anymore to be profitable.
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:26:32
Will drop lower soon, before it will finally go back up.
@_date: 2016-12-29 17:28:06
A Dutch 13.1 node runner here too. Run 13.1 from the day it was released.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:35:34
Next time atleast do not sell all of it, unless you really need the money.
@_date: 2016-12-26 15:43:06
Nope. I can still send Bitcoin to my wallet. In the settings of the app I can also choose my currency including Bitcoin. No issue here.
@_date: 2016-12-24 17:40:07
Merry Christmas! May the Bitcoin rise even more!
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:56:49
1. Hmmm ok. Well so far it's fine. I make some nice money with it
2. I have thought about that, but it seems hardware wallets don't like so many small transactions.
3. Like I said in my first post, they don't want to send it in large badges, because they don't want to keep the bitcoins on their server for security reasons.
4. It's not really a pool. It's a mining company where I mine my coins.
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:49:09
I think it will drop to around 5k before it will bounce back up.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:18:46
Thanks. Hopefully they will get through fast now. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 10:04:04
Awsome! Installed it and it looks and works really good so far.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:47:06
Way too early to say!
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:35:43
It was Blockchain.info?
Not sure what happened. Can you make a screenshot? Whatever you do, just don’t share your private key with anyone!
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:12:12
If you made it on wallets-Blockchain.com, then you have been scammed. :-( Only real bitcoin wallet from Blockchain is Blockchain.info.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:03:27
Lol ��, best comment i’ve seen in a long while!
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:39:29
1.013sat and still stuck. :-( Something has to start to change.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:32:38
0,029 in Total for 0.99BTC. Were a lot of small transactions. It was the regular fee that blockchain.info recommended.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:50:55

Hello and welcome to the club!
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:43:55
Looks like it. :-) But he only wrote Bitcoin as a word. So not sure what he means.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:06:40
No worries. September 2 I bought for a few thousand dollars. Not long after it was worth $ 2000,- less. It’s scary, but now I am at a $2000+! Just hold on to it and don’t sell when it drops. It may take some time, but it will get back up!
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:11:05
That is awsome! Nice work!
However, one thing I want to plint out. The Bitcoin logo is tilt the wrong way. ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:25:06
Are you sure you used the correct site and not and scam site?
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:38:24
Yes. Just make sure you made a backup of your private keys! Also enable second layer of security. Can be SMS. Everytime you try to login, a SMS wil be send to your phone as second check. You have to input the received code in order to login into your account.
Perhaps is better to remove your old account and create a completely new one. That would be even better!
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:09:58
No, 200USD. I knew it would be high. Many small transactions combined together with the full mempool. It sucks, but I had to move it. Didn’t have an option. :-)
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:58:46
You should be able to set the fee manually to 2 Satoshi per byte. Yes, it will say it’s not recommended and it will take some time to get through. But in the end it will come through. No worries. Just will take a couple of hours.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:30:36
Lol! Nice one...
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:58:32
What he is trying to say is: you should not confuse Bitcoin Cash with Bitcoin, because Bitcoin Cash is better. He writes it down in a way on purpose, so that people misunderstand what he actually is trying to say.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:20:34
Ordered one to replace my Ledger Nano. :-)
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:35:23
Not completely convinced yet. Although I have some. 
It's crazy to see there are hardly transactions taking place when you look at the size of the blocks. And yet the price goes sky-high. Someone is clearly pushing the price on South Korean exchanges. The price is not going up because of demand.
If you ask me, at this moment the price goes op, because someone want Cash to be profitable to mine, when the new difficulty kicks in. There will be less blocks from that moment on and so it will be much less profitable, unless the price spikes like it does now.
We will see how things turn out in the coming months. Can always buy more or convert my Bitcoin to Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:37:43
Yes! :-)
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:13:41
Agreed. Even with Segwit the transactions fees are high. As long as no-one is implementing Segwit, the problem will remain.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:53:09
Really feel sorry for you!
Please remember that Blockchain.info is the real site. Always enable an extra authentication and keep your private key save! Make sure you control your own keys!
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:43:24
Nope. Not sure what version you run now. But Core is backwards compatible with older versions. 
But if you can, I would upgrade. :-)
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:36:53
Because there is nothing to complain about. That's why you don't hear anyone.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:00:06
I am happy for you that you reached your moon!
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:41:27

Good for you man! I am happy for you, that you got out such amount for your family!
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:55:58
I didn't say it was. But I don't think the most important people behind Bitcoin Cash, will give up so easily. That's my point.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:33:41
Ah ok! Thanks for explaining. I wasn’t aware of that. Makes a lot of sense!

Crap. Some blocks are corrupt. Tried using an old source and start from a point month ago, but not all files are ok. Guess I have to go through the whole index process.
@_date: 2016-12-27 18:28:55
If  you want a reliable mining option, check out Genesis Mining. You can find them at  They are really transparent about their business. I mine with them for over a year now.
If you decide to buy hashing power there, please consider using my promo key: ug1GFQ
You will get a 3%discount and make me happy too. I get some extra hashing power then too.
Good luck looking for the best option!
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:59:21
I guess you are right about that. Just wanted to speed up my node (Raspberry Pi). Downloading on a pi takes so long... :-)
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:59:55
Just make sure you close all channels and move the funds out, before updating your SD card. Don’t forget to run the cleaning script.

@_date: 2017-09-14 17:44:30
I spend about $ 4500 on a single Bitcoin right before the fall. Have to admit it sucks to see the price drop since then. I will not sell at a loss. It will come back up eventually, although it may take a very long time to reach the $ 5000 again.

@_date: 2019-01-09 19:18:16
It's a Bitcoin core wallet with LND connected. I have 5 channels open and see the value change. It's strange, especially as the first 4 channels have been open for 2 days and have not been closed at all.
I used zap wallet to connect to my personal node.

Although it's not an iPhone wallet I would like to have this in Exodus.io wallet too. They set the fee at almost $4,- to send 0.4 Bitcoin while I can send it with Blockchain.info for  6ct!

Sure would like to see Bitcoin move up to 500K USD! Rather sooner then later. ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:07:25
Use a wallet that allows you to set fees manually. I send $ 1000 yesterday for only $0,40 and even that was still a high fee.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:20:44
5 to 10 sat/b should get you in a block pretty fast now.

I would like to stop working and spend more time with my family. That's why I am prepared to sell some for 1 million each. ;-)
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:45:19
I use it to receive my mined coins. I find it easier to check the amount received during the day. I use two addresses that receive coins. And save it there, before sending it to my hardware wallet.
I used to send it straight to my hardware wallet, but my Ledger Nano does not work so well with a lot of small transactions. They (Ledger) advice to save a certain amount on a different wallet before sending it to the ledger.
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:47:32

Ok, thanks for the tip! I will look into that.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:06:22

I'll sell for that right now. ;-)

Can take a couple of hours for me, as I need to compile the code myself to use Bitcoin qt. Use qt so I can see some nice stats. The pi only does not compile so fast. ;-)
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:41:43
Yeah, can imagine. I like the Pi because of the low power and the cheap price. :-)
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:34:40
Send your bitcoins to a wallet that lets you hold the private keys yourself!
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:21:27
You have your own private keys. When you make a backup, you get to see the keys.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:29:29
Not surprised!
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:11:11
Hmmmm ok. Was just refferd to this topic. I wanted to buy a KeepKey too, but noticed it was sold out. They also did not respond to my questions. That doesn't sound promising.
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:52:49
As lon as you control the keys you’ll have access to the coins after a split. With Blockchain.info you control the keys, so you can use the keys to import the wallet in a bcc wallet after the hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:43:05
Good advice... but it's pretty hard! Especially when the price goes up! ;-)

Agree. I use Exodus.io a lot on my system. And they only use dynamically calculated fee. Can not even set my own fee, which sucks. I understand most people don't understand it, but for advanced users it would be nice to also set the fee manually. Have to pay way to much now.

Not the best ever. The best ever would be when it says it’s above 100k ;-)
