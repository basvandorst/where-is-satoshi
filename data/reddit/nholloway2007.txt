What are ChangeTip's views on centralization of BTC? I feel like CoinDesk and purchasing sites like it (i.e. ones that are connected to an existing bank account) could very well be a step toward a centralized BTC environment, and the whole thing that draws me to bitcoin is the lack of a central "banking" authority. How do you, and ChangeTip, feel about that?

Did anyone else not get a tip during the game, despite tweeting with the hashtag?

I pay taxes by coercion. I don't know about him, but I give Uncle Sam my money so I don't face jail time.

See, my problem is that none of the subs I'm part of really use ChangeTip, and I have no BTC in my account, so I can't share wealth I don't have. Damn debt based economy...

Wish I had known this was a thing. I live near the base.

Might I suggest you read *Economic Science and the Austrian Method* by Hans-Hermann Hoppe?

Sounds like a YubiKey.
