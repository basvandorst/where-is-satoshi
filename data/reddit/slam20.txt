Use coin base to check the current price 
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:53:56
This is very true. Even with buffet saying that he basically doesn't think it's real currency. Bitcoins doing still doing very well.
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:55:10
What does buffet know?! He just a billionaire investor. I respect his opinion but do not share the same beliefs. To the moon!
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:59:19
So it was honestly that simple? Was there any other factors to take into account?
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:13:05
There might be one up now of the video. It's over and I was on my couch and heard his name. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:33:34
Are you talking about gox or all of btc?
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:37:23
We need the good news now more than ever.
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:29:12
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:10:43
Yea I hear you. The futures unpredictable but I guess I'm reaching out to others who can empathize with me. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:30:14
And the falling of another company in recent news my aid to that decision. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:34:46
Agreed. I've learned that I want to better bitcoin and make it more established by supporting it. The extra cash is just a bonus. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:08:18
I personally sold half mine. I,asked a similar question. Check my submitted posts. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:54:13
Stop wasting my time 
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:24:51
I see what you're saying. Thanks 
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:43:13
I see someone like to gamble. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:22:21
Bold statement.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:24:51
I believe them.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:34:07
What does this mean for the future?
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:56:11
I like
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:59:22
This post is bigger than a simple 'no shit.' They're the ones that have a direct line to the public. If you kill the image Bitcoin is damaged. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 05:13:00
It has to be bigger than that 
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:36:33
Have a good day

Ron Paul is one of the most informed and collected politicians. He understands and doesn't assume things. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:10:44
Did you see how much they tried to get him to slip? He handled himself very well with the opposing questions. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:42:06
People still have to build credit, so until credit agencies check your bitcoin rotation limit, fiat and cards aren't going away. :)
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:06:26
I'll,sell you one for 790
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:27:33
Drug dealers hate him.
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:24:48
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:04:12
It says that when you sell one back to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-21 00:15:18
That's what we need 
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:30:02
Edit: tl;dr?
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:01:18
Haha you're not lying 
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:08:04
Hey man, I'm in the same boat about the investment. I'm 25 and I could pay my bills if I lost it all but I'd have to be very frugal to save and may never invest in something like this again. As a business major, this is pretty much going to be my future so I see it as a step into the real world. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:43:09
To be honest I sold had of what I had for a loss to either buy back at a lower price or just reinvest in common stock which I can diversify. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:21:21
Thanks. I don't listen to everyone but I like to hear alternative strategies to things like this. I use reddit as a resource. I've sold half for a loss and I'll decided to keep the rest in to roll the dice. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:36:54
Drop of water in a bucket.
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:35:02
You asked this question to a bunch of bit coin investors...
@_date: 2014-09-29 12:26:17
Agree. Good news equals decline 
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:57:07
Just in time...thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:38:22
I did. People should have more important things to do.
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:32:07
Thanks. This makes sense now
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:21:23
Try again. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 21:35:36
We've seen this too many times... *yawn*
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:09:48
Couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:10:11
Growing currency that's excepted globally. A legal way to circumvent transaction fees implemented by creditors as well as a great way to adjust/advance a business in an evolving market.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:28:05
Byrne is a pioneer by leading the way for corporate America into bitcoin. This guy risked his career, job, connection, and even freedom by accepting and reporting his financial picture. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:51:13
What do I do about my taxes?
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:30:43
This is going to be good. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:13:59
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:33:47
Auto correct*
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:02:48
I love that they base information off the fail/troublesome mtgox. Of course when they reach out to mtgox there was no reply. They should base decisions off of other exchanges and but coin as a whole rather than just off mtgox and their never end conundrum.
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:26:46
So you just hold for an indefinite amount of time? Is it worth it though?
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:55:26
How did it affect the price?
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:12:46
I can't wait until bitcoin cuts gox's dragging anchor. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:40:32
That's pretty interesting. This isn't the first time land has been purchased with btc, it shows that businesses are will off to take on more risk by accepting larger amounts at a time.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:00:27
Welcome to the community 
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:33:17
No worries. Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:03:58
Edit: bitcoin not but coin
@_date: 2014-01-16 19:19:06
Hello, sir.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:58:56
When it rains it pours.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:06:23
This is a very smart move by this casino. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:22:10
If you use somethjng like turbo tax, it will bring you to a menu that has an area to report gains/losses. It's like winning at the casino. Same concept 
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:27:26
You're very right about the dollar comparison. And I believe you when you say it's not a one month investment. That makes a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:37:47
Maybe this was already answered but I thought the FBI shut down Silk Road earlier last year. Which meant that those coin were seized by the FBI and we're going to be put up for auction. It was listed that they had 2% of the market.  Any information would be appreciated. Thanks 
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:14:40
Commenting to check back later

So let's make it a property.

He ran as a presidential candidate. He's considered republican. And he's a former politician. 
 former politician. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:04:47
Give them to him.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:29:33
Home screen coinbase on their iphone and use it that way. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:42:55
What was your last transaction that said that?
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:16:46
They should stop breaking the law. Look at the facts.
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:47:14
I almost thought it was true.
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:23:42
This is good and bad. Bad because btc is a currency. My theory is that they don't want to compete with it. Therefore making it property puts it into a completely different category. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:01:15
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:03:22
Toss one over here.
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:30:49
In that case, there's a few options. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:58:48
Sounds good. I was being lazy.. Not going to lie.
@_date: 2014-01-16 19:36:40
This is great news, but we can't compare all the countries that accept and decline the use of bitcoin. There's much red tape that has to be carefully circumvented. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:10:01
It's pointless from the business perspective but I feel that having a sense if community helps whether it's real or fake. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:33:14
Haha I did just that. Sold some at a considerable loss but I plan on not completely cashing out. We don't know what could happen. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:43:28
10,000 to 2 mil. Not bad if you know what you're doing.
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:46:52
Hacking is a federal offense. So even if NJ decided to not prosecute. The US govt could. Which means it's a criminal offense AKA felony. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:56:17
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:10:05
This guys a drunk mess.
@_date: 2014-05-25 05:13:31
I've been waiting too long for this 
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:16:26
Couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:50:15
This a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:53:58
I agree to some degree. Bitcoin isn't full integrated yet and with the recent problems, progress was slowed down.
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:15:29
Are you saying to get a loan or put more money into my investment therefore making it more liability to asset involvement? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:29:36
Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:40:43
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:40:44
It takes away from the innovation 
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:39:23
I'm old school I guess. So your smart redundant comment gets a down vote.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:40:02
How will 'hacking' help bit coins image and further crypto currencies as a whole. Serious question.
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:31:01
I second this
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:13:29
We need more posts like this. Btc became way too serious. The fun and sense of community is gone. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:36:01
Don't do it. Unless bitcoin is your business.
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:33:40
I completely agree. The reason I use bitcoin is because it is not dictated or manipulated by the 'steps' in the article. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:49:33
Gox should just close up and repay what they can to their buyers. If they have nothing then they should  just leave and leave quickly. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:44:12
Congrats man. Enjoy the ride 
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:32:11
Do you think it will go away? The banning is going to happen but some of those countries really don't matter with the obvious exception of china. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 05:40:56
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:42:40
So you're the reason that coinbase hit its max..
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:03:53
We'll said
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:06:31
I just think it would be a bad idea to base your entire business on an extremely volatile internet currency. Diversify the business income to earn more sources of income.
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:35:01
Hey man. If you're going to call people names on the internet go somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:16:32
This website seems phony.
