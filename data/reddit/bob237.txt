Well, that isn't quite true is it? Only a tiny fraction of people were lucky enough to buy and sell at the right time, and of course avoid the myriad of scams and thefts in the meantime.
In any event it's about comedy, not the money. The farce transcends exchange rates

Incorrect. Take any false statement and append "... is a false statement" and it becomes a true statement. Therefore, there are at least as many true statements as false ones.

When bitcoin is buried in shit, I guarantee that if you put your ear to the shit mound, you will hear a muffled cry of 'this is actually good for bitcoin'

Also a good point. Maybe. People gamble with credit cards too.
But if you want to rule out sites like satoshidice and reduce the actual number of transactions... doesn't that strengthen my argument? ghash.io et al are still making $600m a year, only processing even fewer transactions?
@_date: 2014-07-08 22:41:41
They do use fiat currency. But it's harder for them to transmit over international borders... There's only so many bills you can stuff into your knickers 
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is perfect for this use. Anonymous wealth transfer across state borders. I'm not saying that terrorists are using it, but if they aren't, they are missing out...

Because it sounds reasonable? Its a fraction between 0 and 1. It's bounded on the low end by miners needing to pay electricity bills, and given the slim operating profits on a lot of mining equipment these days, somewhere on the same order of magnitude as 2/3s seems reasonable

Even an optimized database cluster plus some legacy financial stuff is going to be better than bitcoin, in which every transaction ever made is copied onto thousands of computers around the globe and stored there forever.
There is nothing efficient about bitcoin by design or implementation. It's all about the decentralisation

As stated, for me antifragile is meaningless. Devoid of meaning.  The way you have used it demonstrates the twisted tautology used to define it: antifragile is a characteristic that bitcoin has: "What could be more antifragile?". Bitcoin is antifragile. 
The usual pattern seems to be:
1. Something bad happens. There are negative consequences - lost assets, lost confidence, w/e. 
2. However, it doesn't totally shatter the bitcoin protocol
3. Someone, somewhere, can learn some lesson from the bad thing and maybe even propose a hypothetical way of avoiding it in the future, which some people might adopt
4. Antifragile!
It's a modern twist on the broken window fallacy. Someone gets a brick through their window, boards it up, claims their window is antifragile because it is now stronger after the attack and resistant to future bricks. So you see, that brick was actually a good thing...

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news: If BTC ever does join mainstream society, then libertarianism in bitcoin will become as relevant as libertarianism is in the rest of mainstream society.
You don't see people going berzerk now because the government is 'robbing' them by printing dollars.

there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.

Not butthurt. I have actually owned bitcoin - was gifted to my troll account on bitcointalk years ago. And then I sold it a couple of years later when it was worth the effort. I didn't make a fortune,  but enough for a few weeks of fun. I'm definitely ahead of the majority of bitcoin users/'traders'/'investors'.
And I still think that bitcoin is a dumb idea for a currency.
@_date: 2014-07-05 20:41:57
Of course... Grabbed the market data from  if you want to check my workings
e. yes, 'integrating' would be more correct - well, as far as the discreteness of the blocks would allow, summing the product of the block reward and the price at the time it was found. But this is nitpicking, it's not that volatile over 24h, and the daily average is going to be right within a reasonable margin of error

If this counts, then isn't almost everything 'antifragile'? Like our current financial system, in which Bernie Madoff highlighted the need for more oversight and regulation

excuse me but what about the fact that at least 10% of all CC transactions end in a fraudulent chargebacks? makes you think eh

@_date: 2014-07-05 20:35:05
Multiplying the average daily price by 3600 (coins mined per day)... For over last year to date, miners were paid $601,487,208 plus tx fees to secure the network and process about 20 million transactions 
Is that a better deal than credit card companies? They may make 100x more, but they are also processing 3000x more transactions
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:18:14
Awww, he deleted his post. No fun. In it he justified the 8% figure by quoting an article that said visa had a $0.10 flat fee + 2%. Which might be close to 8% if you bought a drink for $1.50. Math.
I don't think 'low fees' is a good selling point for bitcoin, if you include flat fees. The default flat fee on a transaction is already what, $0.06? And that's now, before we've gone to the moon, and while transactions are effectively being heavily subsidised by the block reward. Bitcoin's network is inevitably going to be more inefficient than mastercard's - this is the price you pay for decentralisation. 
good luck with your dog btw

@_date: 2014-07-05 20:22:26
Competition is not relevant. If you want trustless, decentralised, currency, it comes with overheads.
Bitcoin has to disseminate a transaction over a fluid, worldwide distributed network of computers and then a bunch more computers work out millions of hashes to confirm the validity of the ledger. Mastercard just has to  send a message from its terminal to its own server somewhere and update it's own 'ledger'.
Whether CC fees are too much is one thing but on a fundamental level bitcoin isn't going to be cheaper or faster
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:24:35
Intriguing that so many worthless navel-gazing posts are regurgitated and upvoted on this forum about how in the [near] future bitcoin will hypothetically be pervasive and worth the moon...
And yet by asking people to say where exactly that moon is, I'm being silly?

I agree, we need more goxings. Only after everyone has had their coins stolen, will bitcoin be finally secure...

So, the reason btc-e doesn't run with your money now is because they want to maximize their gains when they do eventually cut and run? Seriously? I used to like playing buckaroo when I was a kid but it's no basis for a serious financial enterprise

So, after all the technical bluster, this is where it ends up. Zero-conf double spends aren't possible because if someone did them then other people would get mad. Anyone else think this is a very weak defence? As transaction fees become a larger part of miners income this type of attack is going to be a real problem
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:24:02

Yes. Actually that was what led me to this  topic in the first place. As a semiprofessional bitcoin troll, I was wondering in what circumstances I would start taking bitcoin seriously.
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:08:39
Miners produce 3600 coins a day. Assuming 2/3s of these are sold, that's $1m per day at $450/coin.
If there weren't enough new users buying in every day, then the price would be collapsing. It's not, so there must be a healthy level of adoption QED

Well, by other measures, it's a failure. We're five years from release and by all estimates only a tiny fraction of a percent of internet users have ever used bitcoin. 
The point is not to argue about the current state - it's impossible and futile to call objectively one way or the other now, because we both have an opinion and vested interests. And we're not really at either extreme yet.
That's where the magic of the scientific method comes in. If we make testable, falsifiable statements about the future now then we'll be in a much better position to judge, if those circumstances do indeed come about.
