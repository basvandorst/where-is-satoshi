Personally, I like when bitcoin does this. It's like after you go for a run, you stop and catch your breath, drink some water, and ponder your athletic greatness.
At least that's what I imagine, but I dont run due to my fear of tripping. Which is actually a fear of embarrassment if anyone sees me trip. Not to say it wouldn't hurt if I bumped my shin, or ended up with a broken wrist from clumsily catching my fall. 
Not that I fall alot. Unless its icy outside, like during winter. Even if it is winter, I wouldn't say its alot anyway. I only fell like 4 times this year, and luckily I didnt hurt myself. I dont think 4 times is alot, when you take into account the amount of time I spent outside shov...
You know what? Your right, I'm fucking bored.

"Bitcoin is not money. It's a protocol to transfer money."
Says who? Is this your opinion, or is this a known definition?
@_date: 2019-11-18 07:18:40
It's not possible to be priced in.
Bitcoin needs to be profitable to mine. If it was already priced in, the price of bitcoin would be at least double what it costs to mine, and it's not, because if it was, then more people would mine, the hash rate would go up, and it wouldn't be again.
@_date: 2019-11-11 07:45:19
Yeah, but in my stupid hypothetical the robber has the gun on the cashier. So unless the cashier is wyatt earp or a willing hero like you is around, it wouldn't be worth the cashiers life to save a couple hundred dollars, or maybe it would, depends how much the cashier values their life.
The reason I posted this is because I read about a local robbery at a restaurant and thought about how bitcoin adoption might change situations like this. In the local robbery, nobody pulled out a 45 and blew any heads off, so unfortunately, the reality was that the victim was a "snowflake".
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:34:26
While I see what your saying, I dont entirely agree.
Because in a sense, paper money is just a way to transfer wealth.
So if you look at it that way, your definition of bitcoin would be: wealth transfer, transfer protocol. Which I think isn't the whole story. 
If any country decided to make a crypto currency for their country (which will probably happen), would that be money? Or would that be a money transfer protocol? Then would bitcoin be a wealth transfer, transfer, transfer protocol? 
What if a small country decides to use bitcoin? Then would bitcoin be money, and a wealth transfer, transfer, transfer protocol?
Like I said, I'm not disagreeing with you entirely, I just think your thoughts are too black and white. And I think these are the important economical discussions about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-17 22:56:36
"If Bitcoin became the currency of the world, it would absolutely have to be monitored and regulated by the government."
And which government would monitor and control a global currency?
"US dollar besides the fact that it will always lose value (as will Bitcoin if mining continues)"
Why would Bitcoin lose value if it becomes harder to mine (Bitcoin is deflationary)?
@_date: 2019-11-05 07:18:42

Ok, let's agree to disagree. I have personally seen imaging showing the blood flow of the "Thalamus" in people with Fibromyalgia and people without. I can respect your opinion if your a seeing is believing type of guy, but that leads me to believe you have seen imaging of the "Hypothalamus" in women with low breast milk production if you believe that is real.
You might be right about people with chronic fatigue and adhd though...
@_date: 2019-11-21 06:12:24
I definitely believe that a person's thinking can effect the body. But how is an underactive hypothalamus an "actual impairment" when it comes to decreased breast milk, but an underactive thalamus causing hyperactive nerve impulses (fibromyalgia) not?
I dont understand your reasoning. 
Why cant both be cured by pretending they dont exist? Is blood flow to the thalamus more susceptible to thought then the hypothalamus?

I think the idea of winning "in game currency" when you win a match is ok, in this instance the in game currency would be bitcoin.
The only thing about this that I think would be murky  is the fact that people will try to cheat.
If there is a pool of winnings, say everyone puts in a dollar, and its 100 people, the pool would be $100. Say Dev and game company take 20%, now the prize pool is $80. There are alot of people that will try to cheat for $80 a match. People teaming up and such.

Yeah, my wife doesnt bother me about my bitcoin. 
She asked me once if I was worried about my bitcoin becoming worthless.
I told her that if it ends up worth nothing, its irrelevant because she didnt lose anything, and if it goes hyperbolic, it's irrelevant because she didnt make anything.
I do my part in our finances, past that, she is welcome to ask about it, but I'm ultimately the one who would pay the price.
As far as my friends go, I tell them I own a little, and if they ever want to get into some I'll help, but ultimately I'm not pushy about it, and I generally dont like people asking me how many bitcoin I have, which for some reason, nocoiners are comfortable with, but they are completely uncomfortable with asking someone how much money they have.

Yeah, it's something like 60$ per hour made from on shore wind turbines. Just from the energy production. 
So if they buy 2500 ant miners for 1.2mil, and a wind turbine for 2mil. They would only have to mine bitcoin for 1.5ish years at it's current price and hashrate. 
That being said, they can start selling electricity to customers whenever. But at least the miners will be making them money while they wait for customers. Then they can salvage the miners in a year to get probably a third of there mining investment money back. 
Doesnt sound like a bad racket to me. They could probably pay for there turbines just with bitcoin mining within 2 years (and selling there gear off when the hashrate rises), and then for the remaining life of the turbine (23 years on average) they would sell there energy for a profit.

It's not possible for it to be priced in. If it was priced in, mining would be twice as profitable. But instead, mining is barely profitable. So when the block reward halves, either the price goes up x2, the hashrate is cut in half, or a mixture of both.

No, dont get me wrong, I agree that there is a lot of exaggeration in this sub, but due to it being the Bitcoin sub, I dont really think its unexpected. That being said, I dont think it's a "massive" assumption that Bitcoin could be the global currency. If Bitcoin is successful at scaling before it's to late, there would be no reason for another digital currency, right?
Now let's look at the 10,000x arguement.
In 80 years the value of the dollar will we be worth about 25x less, at current inflation.  
Do you disagree it is possible for Bitcoin to eat up 5% of the 10 largest stock markets?
Do you disagree it is possible for bitcoin to eat up 5% of all savings accounts? 
Do you disagree it is possible for bitcoin to eat up 5% of gold market capital?
If Bitcoin can achieve this
With these factors Bitcoin could easily go 100x (from current price) add that with inflation, your talking 2500x in 80 years. Past that point it's not really worth valuing Bitcoin in terms of the dollar.
While I agree it is exaggerated, I dont think mental stability is at stake. The numbers work. It's just speculation at this point.

But how will mining stay profitable when the reward decreases by half? If this was already in the equation it would be twice as profitable to mine bitcoin, no?
Instead, even if the price doubled in anticipation of the halvening, more miners would join, which would increase the difficulty, thus creating the conundrum we are in.

The price cant possible stay the same though. Which is why price is related to the halvening. Miner rewards go down, the reward must be worth more. The halvening cannot be fixed into an earlier price due to the nature of Bitcoin. That would mean Bitcoin would have to be twice as profitable to mine than it costs to mine, and it's not.
 If it where twice as profitable to mine, more people would buy miners and the difficulty would go up, and it wouldn't be twice as profitable anymore. 
So either A: the price rises.
Or B: miners stop mining. 
Either way, I dont think "zilch" is the appropriate word for the effect the halvening will have on the price.

Do you think the future of money is cash, or do you think it is digital?  If you think it is digital buy bitcoin. If you think it is cash, dont
It seems to me that cash cant continue in it's current form. So I'm going to assume it will end up digital. Pair that up with the transaction advantages, privacy advantages, the fact that it is almost impossible to confiscate, and its deflationary advantages, I would say Bitcoin has a good shot at being worth a good percentage of all liquid wealth.
If you agree, then it's just a matter of time before bitcoin rises in price. Eventually, you will be able to go to the store, scan a barcode, and leave. 
With that information, short term price movements are redundant.

Short scenario: 
Another redditor (redditor A) gives me 100$ to hold on to for her, I put it in my bank account. 
You ask me if you could borrow money from me, so I tell you you can always borrow 100$ from me, you just have to use my debit card that is linked to my bank. And for every 100 you use, you have to give me an extra $4
Now you go to the store and spend 100$ on my bank card. Within 60 days days you give me the money back plus my extra 4$, I put it back in to the bank.
This is how a bank works. Money isn't created out of nowhere.

While I agree with you, some people can use opennode. No reason to push people away from that service if BTCpay doesnt fit there situation. 
Sometimes things like Opennode are appropriate. I would like to see access to all options. 
Specifically if you are a middle to large retailer (+50) transactions a day. Opennode gives you automatic accounting. It tells you how much the order was worth at the time you received it. 
Like I said, I agree with you, but I feel it's unfair to not provide the OP with all possible solutions.

Your not going to get an unbiased answer about Bitcoins future value, on the Bitcoin subreddit. Most of us think it will go up which is why we are here, and the people that say it will go down are people that got burnt, or altcoins trolls. 
My advice, do some research. If you have a computer tech or a finance teacher, talk to them about it. Use your information to decide. 
Bitcoin is supposed to be about the future of finance. It's not a stock.
Maybe buy a small amount and play with it!

But isn't it just as easy to say freedom of choice should apply to exchanges as well? I mean, shouldn't an exchange be able to decide that they want to delist a coin on the premise of the coins reputation? 
I mean, as a business decision, an exchange decides to delist bsv for the following reasons :
1. To remove thier association with what the majority considers a scam (defend their reputation)
2. To acquire new customers. People may see the delisting as a sign of trust and might be more apt to use the exchange.
3. To avoid possible conflict (exchange may have acquaintances that are involved in the lawsuits.)
4. General opinions and beliefs about the negativity of lawsuits in the cryptocurrency space.
5. To increase their reputation as a "good actor" in the crypto space.
Nobody made them delist BSV. Shouldn't they be aloud to do that?

It surely does change the lives of millions. Just using Bitcoin as a way to combat hyperinflation, bitcoin has changed more than a million lives. Not to mention using bitcoin as a way to transfer money.  If Bitcoin can evolve it could change the lives of billions. 
Why not choose a decentralized currency over a centralized one? Now, I agree most people dont care that a big corporate apparatus (government) issues and controls their money, but I do.
If used as a global currency bitcoin would be a nice way to realize currency values. (How much all fiat currencies are worth relative to eachother.) Currently USD is the global currency, which is not a good idea for anybody besides the U.S. If used in this particular case, everybody would feel the effects of bitcoin. The U.S. government wouldn't be able to keep printing global currency. 
Not to mention, Bitcoin has use cases we dont even realize yet.

"Everyone here loves to cite ( insert content to belittle )", is a shitty arguement of why you think bitcoin isn't better than the money your government allows you to use (dont fool yourself, it's their money), and it doesnt change Bitcoin.

I realize that abstract commodity industries are hard to wrap the brain around. 
Bitcoin (the productive asset) produces a ledger (the block chain). The ledger (the block chain) doesnt produce anything because it is the product. The product (the block chain) provides utility.
Much like a farm (the productive asset) produces crops. The crops do not produce anything because they are the product. The product (the crops) provide utility.
You can call me names all you want (I personally think name calling is a non productive asset ��), but I dont see how my character is relevant.

Ok, so 21 trillion market cap. But this is a weird way of looking at it. I mean, imagine there is 1 million shares of x company, each one worth a dollar so they have a 1 million market cap. Now say the company destroyed one of those stocks. The price would still be a dollar because the market wouldn't feel such a negligible effect. 
Now imagine there are only 10 shares of a company worth 100,000 a piece so they also have a 1million dollar market cap. If the company destroys one of these shares, the market has gained 10% worth, with the same market cap. 
This is why bitcoin is so volatile, because there isn't enough liquidity (amount of shares) so when somebody sells 1000 Bitcoin, it is noticable. I think this fact alone could bring the price to a million. Eventually, when big investors sell their bitcoin, they will hang on to some of it. Ask any investor if they do this (most do). If everybody is hanging on to a chunk of bitcoin then the demand will outgrow its supply. 
But you didn't answer my question. Do you think bitcoin will ever be worth one million?

I mean as an example, in the VR (virtual reality) subreddit, you dont see people saying they hate vr and its stupid, or that it is a dying technology. Its bizarre to see people that dont believe in Bitcoin and think it is worthless spend so much time on the Bitcoin subreddit. What do they get out of it?

What if tomorrow Venezuela dumps 10bil into bitcoin? Will your line make a sudden sharp turn?

The only people that engage on altcoins are:

2) hoping to get rich off "the next bitcoin"
3) unloading bags
Either way, Bitcoin is on top. Cant argue the numbers. I guess you could make an arguement that someday another alt may take over for such and such reasons. But currently, alts are way down from their highs, and ₿ remains king. Good luck!

You say the smart guys like Lee and 100x anonymous users dumped. But you dont mention the many people that bought. 
I'm not sure what your getting at when you say the point is not to have bitcoin, the point is to have s happy life. That is like me telling you how I brush my teeth, you say "that's not what the dentist says", and I say "the point is not brushing your teeth, the point is having a happy life".
I'm not concerned about the hash rate. What will miners use their machines on? Will they just shut them off, and throw them away? Worst case scenario, the hash rate drops a little.
Also, I dont feel like my "American dream" is in jeopardy. Much like you telling me about the point to life, I dont think Bitcoin is related.

Every transaction becoming part of the blockchain (mining?) and billions of people download (nodes?). What percent of those perform verification?: you can verify a transaction has been included in a block through any block explorer, or you can run a node and check it yourself. If you are truly interested you should do a quick google search for basic understanding of blockchain. 
That being said, a quick run down: you send bitcoin, it is included in a block (first confirmation). A block is mined every 10ish minutes. The next block that is mined buries your transaction deeper in the block chain ( more confirmations). As far as verifying your transaction you can check through a block explorer, or you could run a full node and verify it yourself.
 In my opinion, the electric used beyond mining is negligible. My phone uses about 6watts to charge it for a whole day. I can check transactions and send transactions as much as I want on 6 watts a day, which is secondary to the real purpose of my phone (email, calls, text, facebook, browsing the internet). I am by no means a "folk who knows the tech well" but this is the understanding I have.

"Baffoon"�� 
The first time I bought bitcoin, at around $28 each. I thought, "it's easy not to worry when people bought at $5 each." I was once you. 
I've bought bitcoin at $100 $1000 and $6000, so I'm holding bags as well. I dont see why you responded so aggressively. It's hard for me to imagine a guy behind a computer like " this guy is such a baffoon, I cant believe he would say that". 
The difference is, I'm not telling people what to do. I'm telling them what worked for me. OP is saying "your an idiot if you do that" which is odd to me. 
Saying things like "this is a retarded arguement" and "a baffoon like you" really says alot about you. I really hope people can see what type of human you are. 
In 3-5 years, the people that got into bitcoin this year will be telling new adopters to Hodl, and another new adopter will say its retarded and call him a baffoon. Around and around we go. 
This happened at every crash bitcoin has ever seen, and they always say this time is different. Its redundant.

Bitcoin has no use case? What about its ledger? You can sell houses on the blockchain, or cars, or intellectuall property. It can be used to transfer money. It can be used to hedge your money against hyperinflation. It can be used as a currency. It can be used as a way to hide money from a tyrannical government. It can used to buy black market stuff. It can be used for micropayments (tipping). It can also be used as tokens for blockchain functions (transport and shipping, keeping track of employees, etc.). I could go on...

 "if you just thought about things yourself, you wouldn’t need that word ever again." 
"Blockstream that own bitcoin, should work harder"
 "if you knew about Bitcoins short coming, and what projects they are working on, you wouldn’t need to ask"
"If you kept up with all things crypto you’d realise"
I feel a theme here...

 I would much rather the developers take their time to ensure a good job. I guess this is where we differ. I dont think either of us are "wrong", I'm just a bit more conservative. I didn't agree on lightning being released early, but it seems to have worked out ok thus far.

Or maybe bitcoin scaling continues to progress until there are more that a million transactions per block. Then if transaction fees are 100 - 200 sat per transaction, miners get to split a whole bitcoin or 2.

That "rubbish bitcoin talk" is what started bitcoin. It is what made bitcoin go from an idea to an asset. I guess you can see the future better than me. 
I wish the government good luck monitoring my bitcoin purchases. I pay my house taxes, income taxes, and sales tax, beyond that... happy hunting.

I thought I understood it ok. If somebody accepts crypto for payment on a house, or a hot dog, there would be no need for fiat conversion.

I understand what you said. My point is: online shopping has been around for 23 years, and tax laws still haven't caught up with the time. It could take a while for crypto aswell. 
I dont feel its irrelevant, I think not declaring the sales tax of online purchases from another state is fraud as well. Do you disagree? Maybe I should be awaiting a knock on my door. I do alot of online shopping.

So you agree with me that 1 BTC = 1BTC  is not "a big joy". Because your right. Now that we have come to that conclusion, I dont remember thinking u/Hardeth was expressing joy when he made the comment that you criticized by saying he was "purposefully dense". It would be nice upon exit of this conversation (stop flogging this poor horse) if you could realize you where being unnecessarily assholish to him. I'm sure you will find a way to justify this nonsense. But that was really my point.

Ok, I can get with you on that. It has many uses, but the majority isnt using it as such. Like gold, it has use cases, but mainly it's an investment tool (speculation). 
I dont think it's fair to say that because a commodity isnt as convenient to use as another commodity means it isnt a commodity. 
I challenge you to find a more secure "incredibly slow database". This is where the term "dont trust, verify" comes from.
That being said, I think Bitcoin is in its infancy and I'm excited to see what these developers make. I'm very excited about the things I dont even know I can use my bitcoin for in the future. 
In the meanwhile, I think speculation isnt a bad thing, as it adds interest. People like Jack Dorcey giving money to development teams will only help Bitcoin.

Bitcoin specifically. I dont use alt coins.  What did you think I was talking about? Can you not see a world in which Bitcoin is just traded amongst peers? That's how it was in 2011. I'm sure the darknet guys and gamblers will still need to buy and sell. Just my opinion. Who knows, maybe Overstock will still be around after Bitcoin completely crashes. Maybe coinbase too, and all of the other exchanges, and all of the developers. I wonder if all the mining companies will shut down, and the bitcoin gift card companies. I wonder if my own website will stop accepting bitcoin payments? Damn! The more I talk about it the less I think I'm going to be able to buy a $10 bitcoin. You have completely ruined my day.

Not to go against the hate western union narrative here, but what if my brother needed money right now, but he doesn't know how to use Bitcoin, or he doesn't have a way to use it? This would be a good service.
As time passes and more people accept crypto, this service would become less useful, but until then, this service could be an asset in certain situations.

The developers working on their side projects owe nothing to you.
Also: you can do what you want, but for the benefit of all, maybe you could try not to discourage people from asking why in the future. Asking why is a very efficient way of transferring information between humans. This is a thing.

There are lots of things people dont pay taxes on. Look at online shopping, technically in the U.S. if you buy something from a seller in another state, the burden is on you to pay the sales tax. Do you think the tens of millions of people send in their sales tax?

Here is the part I disagree with. "The bot controls funds that matter". I dont see why anyone would put an amount in the tip bot that would matter. If you have an amount that matters, withdraw it to a channel. 
I think an exit scam would be negligible provided people are using the tip bot as a tip bot, and not as cold storage.
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:07:08
Well, provided you have a LN channel, there are basically no fees to deposit or withdraw. As far as being "trusted", it's a tip bot... I would hope you wouldn't keep more than you plan to tip other people in your balance. And so long as you have a LN channel, you can use it with little to no fees during the next "fee event" as well.

Well, some people think futures help people short the market (it does), and so bitcoin will plummet. Also, futures doesn't really provide a service beyond speculation. That being said, it is probably good because it will expose people to Bitcoin. Also, these particular futures are supposed to be settled physically, which means someone actually has to own the Bitcoin, so it should increase volume as well. As far as price, no one can really tell if it will increase or decrease.
