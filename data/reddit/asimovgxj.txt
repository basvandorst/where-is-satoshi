Thank you. Your right. 
So looks like it impossible that if there's huge fund to short ,then require equal huge fund to long? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:10:15
I don't think short position will HAVE to be matched to someone elses long position reg. CME bitcoin future.
It's naked short.

why you can start text thread in r/bitcoin? I can only post link here.

No. Not the same! Look at the charts of different commodities since the 70s and how they behaved before &amp; after they have been involved in futures or any other 'certified' investment products.
This time Bitcoin will not revive if don't detach CME by hard fork or some other strategy.

Any Wall Street involvment is not good.Just have a look at the charts of different commodities since the 70s and how they behaved before &amp; after they have been involved in futures or any other 'certified' investment products.
I don't believe there's such a coincidence that just after the CME futures was released in 18-12-2017 the bitcoin's price never again was the same. You cannot fight with the present monetary system and at the same time hope for any kind of involvment from banks or government backed institutions. WALL STREET, THE BIG PLAYER THIS TIME.
I don't think Bitcoin to become the only one in the history which can conquer CME futures market .

No one talking about CME which is born to shor B.T.C ??!!
Bitcoin will never be back to 10,000 ,ever ,until detaching CME by hard fork or some other strategy!
Everyone pls realize it's CME to blame,not ban FUD!!
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:13:22
Maybe people move to something else. 
It's a big deal for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:46:29
Yes. Before CME involvment, quite a few people predicted the decline of BTC price . 
But 0.01% of people at r/Bitcoin understand or accept that it's the CME to blame for current crash. They just don't agree with it. I don't know why !!
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:38:08
Bitcoin can not recover unless detaching CME by hard fork or by some other strategy.
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:40:22
Reason...I think it's the long term effect of the rmb&lt;-&gt;btc BAN starting to show.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:24:11
CME and Wallstreet don't play game like us, their aim is to kill crypto coins.

Cool. Now people can shout out fuck china twice

However thanks for your comment.
But do you believe there's such a coincidence that just after the CME  futures was released in 18-12-2017 the bitcoin's price never again was the same.
You cannot fight with the present monetary system and at the same time hope for any kind of involvment from banks or government backed institutions.

Am not a 2X fans. But tbh when you try something time and time and time again, there can be a great chance that you make it. So am wondering when this kind of split/fork stuff will end in the future.

tell cn gov : never resume their exchanges pls ! and ,try to shut down pools or do the 51% attacks then the whole world know bitcoin can survive these
