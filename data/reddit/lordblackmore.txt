Is this supposed to be some sort of revelation? People who made their money the "old fashioned way" are generally going to trust what they know and have experience with. At the same time, I wouldn't dismiss what any of these people have to say, because they may have valuable insight. 
I don't know what the point of putting Nobel in quotes is, but it seems like a passive aggressive way of dismissing them.

Oh for Christ's sake. Apple didn't ostracize the BTC community. They made a business decision based largely on the unregulated nature of BTC and their potential liability. They didn't say BTC sucks or that they're against it. They made a simple, rational business decisions. 
If you weren't so stupidly and blindly anti-Apple, you'd have been able to figure it out for yourself instead of making up a story about what Apple did. 
And no, one supplier not selling Apple gift cards doesn't mean "we" (and seriously who is "we") Apple is going to be excluded from the BTC economy.

What you have to understand is that there are people who think Apple sucks and that anything they do is evil. It's an irrational position, but if you look at some of the comments through that lens, you'll see where the bad arguments come from.

They're absolutely alienating people who buy Apple gift cards. And it might be a suprise, but when someone buys a company's product, they're (gasp) customers. So yes, they are alienating Apple customers who want to buy Apple gift cards with BTC. 


You're basically the only person in this thread who thinks there's some kind of conspiracy going on.

Continuing to repeat something won't make it be true.

Spoken like someone who has a hair up his ass about Apple. People like you act as if Steve Jobs himself stole your girlfriend, kicked your dog and set fire to your house. 
There are a lot of valid criticisms that can be leveled at Apple. Unfortunately, all you've got is the same tired old anti-Apple BS.

I could spend all day and all night laughing at the level of butthurt you have about Apple.

There's a larger point here. As a business they have the right to sell or not sell whatever they want.
But people who really want btc to become more widely accepted probably shouldn't be cheering when things like this happen.

There's dumb and there's your kind of super dumb.

I never said anything about Ver being dumb. In fact, my comment had nothing to do with Ver at all. It has to do with the abject stupidity of claiming people are "leeching off of his hard work" which somehow means he's supposed to be above criticism. 
The criticism of Ver in this thread is absolutely warranted. He rejected his citizenship and has a criminal record. The criminal record alone is enough to disallow his entry into the U.S. for a non-citizen. He made his choices and now he gets to live with the consequences of the choices.

I guess I was bitten in the ass by Poe's Law. :) Well played.

The U.S. Government is the duly elected authority and as such is tasked with enforcement of our immigration laws. You don't like it, work to change the laws or if that's still distasteful for you, use the Ver method and go somewhere you'll be happier. 
So simple even a potatoe can understand it.

The don't need moral authority. All they need is legal authority, which they have. Perhaps it's going to be surprise to you, but the U.S. rejects visa requests all the time for all kinds of reasons.
The only reason this is in the news is because it's someone who renounced their citizenship and made a big deal of it.

Make no mistake, though. That guy is going walk away thinking they won the argument.

This has to be satire.
