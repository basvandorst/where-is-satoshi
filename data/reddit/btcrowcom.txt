How do I get a prospectus from Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities.

Firstly, I have emailed snoodsispro personally to apologise for the delay, which was clearly our fault. I also requested that snoodsispro remove many of his scam allegations from the internet or to at least update them as btcrow.com is clearly not a scam site. However snoodsispro has not replied to me. 
Normally we release escrows within 24 hours of the buyer giving us the OK (the final step is manually approved). I was overseas during March/April, and had very poor internet coverage, this delayed the release of some escrows and also delayed our response times. 
snoodsispro's escrow was FULLY released. We did not withhold $30 as alleged in his EDIT. The transaction was in BTC, and snoodsispro was fully paid in BTC, not dollars. If snoodsispro would reply to my email and remove/amened his internet comments about BTCrow.com scamming people, I would compensate him for the $30 he claims to have lost.
It's not our policy to post details of transactions. However since snoodsispro has already posted many articles all over the internet with details of the transaction here are the blockchain.info payment details:
The funds were released to this address: 1QHGEmKFtENRRMH51Kt1CT9EGyLLB56AXL
