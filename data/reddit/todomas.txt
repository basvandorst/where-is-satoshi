Wtf dude u r dumb 
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:13:44
Wow  Is it really that simple?   
@_date: 2014-04-05 00:45:43
We could draw parallels to Mt Gox and a corrupt money exchange      Not a bank.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:20:08
It'd just be more convenient to be able to directly buy it from a website 
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:59:16
Where was this?
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:03:54
This is exactly what I meant thank you.  It'd be great if blockchain.info did this.
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:05:14
I told him that you can buy giftcards with them because he was trying to make the point of how there are limited vendors accepting bitcoin and that was my way of showing him that there are ways that you can still make payments to vendors who don't directly accept bitcoin.     What's your take on Bitcoin?  I'm just wondering.   Do you think bitcoin or just crypto currencies in general have a place in the future?
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:32:39
You can buy visa giftcards with store giftcards:(
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:23:44
With this logic wouldn't Bitcoin be susceptible to failure and to being over valued because it is being built off of the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:45:56
When commenting on these kinds of posts this should be your first comment.   People would appreciate this kind of input over a condescending remark on their knowledge of the subject at hand.
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:24:30
Ehh I wasn't looking for a specific answer just someone's else's take    I personally feel like it is a lot a speculation with a dash if demand but I love what bitcoin represents nonetheless 
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:39:26
... I just answered a comment briefly explaining explaining our arguments and points    I guess I should have included that in the sub text     
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:56:30
There's the same problems with regular money    You're being virtually pick pocketed.   With both BTC and USD you must take the proper steps to secure your money
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:49:22
And I haven't lost my argument with him if he's being open enough to here me out he's open enough to consider facts.

Damn you just threw $500 at the kid!?  He's going to buy a new gaming rig!  My address is 16t8xdVTtV45MJmDGRhntmXE57NFDZwXPa if your still feeling generous;)
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:37:18
He says how Bitcoin isn't valid because it doesn't have any physical backing.   He also talks about how inconvenient bitcoin is for purchases.  He said to me before Christmas break, go to a grocery store and buy me something with bitcoin, go on ebay and buy me something with bitcoin.   I've explained to him how you can use gyft to get giftcards for many store but he i at convinced
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:42:41
He easily could have avoided this by using a paper backup   His fault not bitcoins'
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:13:02
On the site it says that because of encryption they don't even have access to my coins or password   What does this mean if they get hacked?
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:06:51
Haha thanks I'm actually one of this teacher favorites because try to have something to contribute to the class
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:45:55
I think Bitcoins are great because they offer an extent of privacy, are open source, and because they are decentralized to name a few reasons.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:21:24
A Visa Giftcard is the only thing they don't have:(

Basically it seems like most all os's are compromised.   If you have anything to hide from Uncle Same or if he wants to see what contents you have he's gonna see it.   Do you understand the importance of the 4th ammendment?

The fear mongering is real with this guy.   
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:03:37
Allegedly.    DPR called a hit and we have no idea if it was the other users who had access to the DPR account.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:52:04
Can you explain to me how that makes it's value go up tho?   I'm really in the dark tbh
@_date: 2018-10-30 20:06:25
I hate Trump but serious economists have floated the idea of just printing a trillion dollar coin. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:48:21
No.   I think the downvoats come from the fact that it would be insanely difficult to enforce a ban
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:52:00

Same thing happened to me!    I was playing with friends and they told me to buy rainbow 6 and I was like only if can pay in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:05:50
My end goal for bitcoin is actually to buy a Tesla with it
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:59:28
Lol nevermind

It's still recoverable but kraken would have to recover it for you I'm petty sure
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:52:13

The way I see it is that Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin in the same inverse that Ethereum is the real ether as oppposed to Ethereum classic.   I'm not super read up on the politics of both sides but the way I see it is the one with the most OG users and insitutional support is the most legitimate network.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:18:15
But realistically the rich do hold the capacity and ability to manipulate it's price as they do with any other currency 
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:55:50
I don't think people should be able to freely Express themselves as a nazi.  You know because a core nazi belief is the extermination of jews
@_date: 2019-04-20 06:56:06
That's gonna be a no from me dawg
@_date: 2019-04-26 00:30:03
I mean it's cool that other sites are integrating it but I'd rather it not consisted of a bunch of alt-right neo-Nazi types
@_date: 2019-01-24 06:55:30
Illegitimate and not elected democratically 
@_date: 2018-11-16 06:06:21
I would use ether or ltc before I used Bcash

@_date: 2019-01-11 01:59:04
Everyone go check out the Dave Rubin subreddit lol
@_date: 2019-01-16 17:08:03
Dave Rubin is gay and is supportive of Brazils new President, who is very in favor of killing gays.  Not the brightest crayon in the box

Weird that I've been getting the same responses from everyone calling me an NCP kind of ironic 
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:39:37
What claim of mine would you like a source on il gladly provide
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:00:22
He didnt say that it isnt risk free he said that it tears the soul apart.  He has also floated the idea of state intervention on this issue.  Do you agree with that as well?   I've had casual sex and my partner and I are still very good friends.
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:57:28
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:46:17
The guy you're replying to isnt me. He didnt make any claims.  I gave you sources in a comment above. Chill out 
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:46:06
Except for the fact that 97% of climate scientists agree that global warming/climate change to the extreme degree that we are seeing it is caused by humans.  You just dont like science man. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:27:55
No lol im in my twenties 
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:09:32
Okay here the one where he thinks the Chinese discovered DNA.  He's talked about it on multiple occasions so I can provide more links if this isnt sufficient.
@_date: 2018-12-31 03:45:33
 
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:16:15
He does deny it. Il give you links. 
Dont forget that according to nasa, 97g of climate scientist agree that climate change to the extreme degree that we are experiencing it are caused by humans.  I can source that if you like but its am easy Google.
He said he's not sure that men and women can work together in the workplace yet.  It's pretty fucking obvious that we can.
And yes the C-16 Bill part is true.
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:42:37
So you would support genuine people who actually do want to do something about it right?
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:03:49
No that's actually totally the right question. Jordan Petereson has made a ton of false claims and I think that makes his credibility unreliable.  Which  false claim would you like me to provide a source for? 
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:16:27
Dude Jordan Peterson is a nutcase.  If anything theres still hope for you.  He gives some decent self-help advice in his book but in general he tends to pepper in a lot of anecdotes, misrepresentations and pseudoscience when he gets into politics
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:21:58
������ okay buddy.  How about the fact that 97% of climate scientists agree that climate change to the extreme degree that we are experiencing it is caused by humans?  Here's my source.
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:56:53
I did sound like a misunderstanding or didnt? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:00:38
������ what's their agenda?  A nearly limitless source of solar energy that doesnt pollute?  Aren't those multinational oil corporations globalist?
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:25:07
I bought about 75$ of worth of BTC my senior year of highschool. It equated to about .31BTC  I'm approaching my senior year of college and it's now worth $900.   This also means that I own more wealth in BTC than USD
@_date: 2018-12-31 06:50:06
It's really great lol
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:13:49
Lmao I'll link you the video.  
Conversation starts around 4 mins.  He thinks women only wear lipstick to attract mates and that means they want to fuck their coworkers so were really not sure if men and women can work together.  Imagine unironically calling someone else an NCP lmao. literally all of the other claims are true too.  
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:41:38
Dude if a women wearing lipstick is gonna distract you from your job you have problems lmao
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:15:28
 The US dollar is the most powerful currency in the world and it's not backed by anything
@_date: 2018-12-30 23:01:13
Yeah I don't give a fuck about Jordan Peterson using bitcoin.  I do give a fuck about his stances against birth control, gay marriage, casual sex, and plenty of other ridiculous things.
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:10:22
No it's because the dude is straight up nutty.  He shells out very basic self help stuff in his book and then gets paid by the koch brothers and other right wing elites to deny climate change.  He is against casual sex and gay marriage and a plethora of other things that are completely reasonable.
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:22:04
Would you like a source on that one too?
Here you go. 
Stop accusing others of lying because you havent done you're own research 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:51:09
Seriously?  I feel like I could easily get scammed on Craigslist 
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:40:39
It's a Vice video featuring Jordan Peterson������
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:00:21
Jordan Peterson is a bafoon.  He denies climate science, claims to have been kept awake for months because of apple cider, thinks the Chinese discovered DNA thousands of years ago because of snake double helix drawing, doesnt think men and women can work together in the workplace.  He's pretty psycho. His claim to fame was misrepresenting a Canadian Bill that made it so businesses couldnt discriminate against hiring transgenders and tried to say it was now illegal to misgender someone.
Edit: words
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:23:26
Someone disagrees with you? Just call them an NPC!  Nothing ironic about an entire group using the same term to label people who dont hold the same beliefs as them! Totally not something an NPC would do!
@_date: 2019-05-02 02:31:24
Yeah maybe we should stop sanctioning their oil exports so they can sell and cash in on what is rightfully theirs
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:03:22
I said he floated the idea lmao.  And he's definately suggesting that the state might find it necessary to intervene.  That's a totally insane thing to suggest considering the amount of people engaging in casual sex has been decreasing for a while now 
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:45:27
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:57:47
What would you like a source for
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:32:50
Here you go man.  Ironic how you're like the 8th person to call someone who doesnt like Jordan Peterson an NCP in this thread. 
Here's another link for another claim I made 
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:59:50
Solar energy is literally more cost efficient than fossil fuels now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:00:05
Alright i will definitely try Craigslist 
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:38:45
Definitely listen to this guy!  He's who started me up in Bitcoin and is very smart with his money
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:38:40
I do t want to use a deposit because I'm only 17 and I just kinda feel weird about it honestly because I've never really used a bank before without my parents 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:51:34
Thanks il check it out right now!!
@_date: 2018-12-26 06:20:40
Okay then yeah with your Hurricane Katrina examples you seem to understand the importance of improving our infrastructure before tragedies strike instead of after.  We now understand how most people are very short sighted but we also know what's going to happen if we dont start making changes.  The damages of rising sea levels and inclimate weather will be in the trillions so we need to act now and do everything in our power to prepare.  
And yeah people still consume wastefully at alarming rates and we cant expect individuals to change their lives.  Most pollution is done by corporations who dont give a shit about anything than making as much money as possible as easily as possible.  We need to create regulations that will incentivise corporations to go solar and we need to invest more money on rebuilding our infrastructure before we literally have to rebuild it.

Is it necessary to have a laptop to exchange BTC or will a smartphone work too?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:53:19
I don't want to be a day trader by any means if that's what you're saying.  I've been looking at bitcoin for about a year now and I just want to buy some bitcoin in hopes the price over it rises significantly over a log period of time
