This is an old thread so the only person who will see new posts is me (the thread creator), and I'm definitely no expert. You might want to make a new thread for help.
That being said, try directly checking the wallet where you sent your coins using an app like Mycelium.

Excellent explanation, thank you!

By back-up, I assume you mean a mnemonic recovery? Blockchain had me do the same thing when I signed up for a wallet there. I'm not too worried about it for now as there is less than $3 worth of bitcoins in the wallet for now, but if I end up taking bitcoin a lot more seriously as a financial venue, I'll definitely do that. Thank you!

That shouldn't be possible as hexadecimal only includes 0-9 and a-f. I sent you a PM.

Yes, the receipt is as follows:
    Buy Receipt
    Time: 2015-10-10 15:37:07
    USD: 38
    Bitcoin: 0.15444015
    Robocoin Transaction ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx9ea9
    
    Thank you, BitcoinNW

I don't know if the transaction ID is safe to post online so I blocked it out.
edit: The transaction ID is hexadecimal, which I know bitcoin wallet addresses are not, so that can't be it.
edit2: The service has an option to send money, so if I sent a hundredth of a coin to my blockchain wallet address, would it show up on the receipt there?

Result is "unrecognized search pattern" regardless of whether or not I include the dashes

Yes, I'm able to check my balance on the site and it shows BTC 0.15444015 - the exact amount I bought. But without a wallet address, how do I send money to that wallet or spend any of the money on it at an online retailer that accepts bitcoin?

Alright, I created a Mycelium wallet, and sent 0.01 BTC to there from my Romit wallet to the new one on Mycelium. The money was sent successfully, however I'm still waiting for it to be confirmed. However, after I did that, my Mycelium wallet address changed! Does it always do this after every transaction?
Thanks for being so understanding.

My, that's a lot to read. I'll go through it when I'm not at work. ^ ^
Thank you, though! I'm sure it'll help me understand bitcoin better.

That makes sense.
A few more questions if you don't mind.
I'm looking at the transaction hash on blockexplorer.com and it says 0.5 BTC was generated, but I don't even own that much bitcoin. The 0.01 BTC went into my Mycelium wallet as intended, 0.0005 was collected as a miner fee, and then 0.4895 went somewhere else. Where did the rest of that money come from? Not that I'm worried because the money isn't mine and never was, but I'm curious and I want to understand this technology better.
Also, if I go back to that kiosk to trade cash for bitcoin, I assume it will have to go to my Romit wallet every time, where I can then transfer it to Mycelium as my main "bitcoin bank account?"
