This thread is about *offline wallets* as stated in the title and they are using the Ledger Nano S as an example.  The electrum question is completely valid in the context that the person is asking about it being a viable offline wallet, which it can be.  A Raspberry Pi 1 is great for this as it doesn't have any WiFi or bluetooth features built in and very cheap!

Things that make me a bit nervous with devices like the Ledger Nano S is the following type of situation...
Say I move some BTC to my Ledger Nano S, save my 24 word seed and store it away.  Five years from now, I get my Ledger Nano S out and it doesn't work.  Say during this time, the company making these is now out of business and no longer making this product.  What would I be able to do with a 24 word seed and broken Ledger Nano S to get access to my BTC?
Seems people keep complaining when people leave their crypto on exchanges where others are holding it for you, but when it's on a hardware device like a Ledger Nano S, you still seem to be at mercy of the company who made the device.

Thanks!  I didn't catch that detail in the features listing, but that's awesome to know!

I also love their reasoning to attack crypto because it's used for black market and illegal goods.  As soon as physical cash is removed from existence, then they have a chance to then point at crypto, as physical cash can be even more capable of hiding movement.  It really sucks that anyone these days can pick up the mic and talk  :(

Well, there's still microbits, or ubtc.  1 ubtc is 0.0033, or one-third of a cent, but in the future it may be a better alternative to mbtc!

Unfortunately, there is someone always wanting to fight from the other side, no matter how right you are and how perfect a solution is.  Hell, we have a growing group of people today that insist the earth is flat... it's really a sad state!

You have to give the donation some meaning... seems an average testicle is about 2 ounces, or .057 kg.  He could donate .057 BTC and put his money where his mouth *would* have been!

Who says he can afford either donation amount?  Why are you comparing my analysis as an undercut to what?  The original commenter said "0.2BTC (or any amount of your choosing)", which does not define a clear amount.  Are you going to argue that the original post undercut the charity by some arbitrary amount as it could have been 1BTC, 100BTC, or more?!?
I do appreciate you taking a comical post and trying to turn it into some kind of negative against a charity.  Best wishes to you!

Not to be stupid here, but is crypto mining a gold mine in Venezuela?
If the monthly minimum wage is $7.20 and I'm making about $2/day with a GTX 1070 mining, that's about 1/4 the total monthly minimum wage earned in a single day.  Given that monthly minimum wage is about $1,250 in the US, if I earned 1/4 of that being about $315 per day, I think I'd be quitting my day job!

The shortage is probably compounded right now with the new upcoming GPU's and nVidia focusing on building up stock of those to sell and not so much on manufacturing the old GPU's they will be replacing.  Either way, they would be making money as fast at they can make the cards!

Not counting the direct financial competition with fiat, there is still a direct dependency on fiat when it comes to the backbone of crypto as a whole.  The internet is a crucial part of the blockchain succeeding and those avenues are both closely tied in with the government and fiat.  There needs to be a solar/wind powered mesh network solution that can run independently by each person.  This would rid the centralization of data transferring and eliminate the need for fiat to both ISPs and power companies.  The biggest hurdle is getting EVERYONE to get one of these devices!  Maybe I should just white paper this and start an ICO, lol!

If he's gpu mining with NiceHash to buy PC games, it's likely he is in the Ether market and maybe doesn't know it... he will just be receiving BTC as payment, but he should definitely be interested in what's making him money!

I still can't figure out what that title is supposed to mean.
