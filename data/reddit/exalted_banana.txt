It's literally impossible to tell at this point in time. The next 48 hours might shed some light.

Ye, I still have a small mining operation going just in case.

I lost a small amount in this bull run, selling at 7k, anticipating a plunge which never happened, so I bough back at 7.6k just to be safe. Fuck day trading in this unpredictable market. This could dive to 6k again. Or break 9k. Who knows? Not me. I'm holding. 
At the very least, don't be an idiot like me and only day trade a small amount of your total holdings.

Held the dip, cashed out today at net profit of 50 cents. The volatility just isn't worth my neurons.

From what I've seen even seasoned experts are timid when it comes to making crypto price predictions. Don't trust anyone who sounds like they're reading from a crystal ball. And yeah, like others have said, do not invest more than you're comfortable losing. Buy low, sell high, read the news, educate yourself. You don't need an "adviser" if you follow those principles.

I bought in at 11. Now I sit alone in my bathtub, contemplating on swallowing a Tide pod.

That's only a US thing, right? I'm in EU.

Maybe although I wouldn't bet on it. Mostly because I have no god damn money left.

I honestly did not think it would have such a bullish effect. I thought it would rise a little bit and then get dumped hard into 5k. Granted, that could still happen. But man it's nice to see green for a change.
