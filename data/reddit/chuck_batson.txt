"Actually, throwers don't worry about ticking 'cause modern bombs don't tick. But when a suitcase vibrates, then the throwers gotta call the police. Nine times out of ten it's an electric razor. But, every once in a while... it's a bitcoin. Of course, it's company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a bitcoin. We have to use the indefinite article *a* bitcoin, never *your* bitcoin." ;-)

Here's a good discussion of sample size:  This sample well above the minimums discussed. How many samples would you suggest?

It's a fun and interesting exercise to roll your dice a bunch and measure the results. I found my hexdice didn't have nearly the even numerical distribution I was expecting:

A differing distribution is not necessarily abnormal, true; but the probability that the distribution I observed is from a fair die, using the chi square goodness of fit test, is very very small. The surprising part is how far away from fair the distribution is (p &lt; 0.0001). How many rolls would you suggest?

Nice analysis. Two questions:
1. If the dice are truly fair, then certainly the exact sequence I rolled is one possible outcome. So isn't it possible that the chi square test is incorrectly rejecting a fair die?
2. How did you compute the entropy of 3.96 per roll from the distribution data?
*Edit: Changed "random" to "fair."*
*Edit: Clarified entropy question.*

Good read, thanks! It's not clear to me though how Poisson distribution applies.

Good move generating them offline! You could also generate BIP0038 encrypted private keys in a similar way, using your awesome password. This is a good way to keep multiple copies securely (both digital and paper/physical). I don't know much about PGP, but the scrypt used in BIP0038 is intentionally slow, making brute-force attacks an impractical proposition.

The distribution is nowhere near as even as I was expecting. Has anyone else measured their hexadecimal dice?
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:14:59
No, this is great. When randomness and statistics intersect it always leads to a fascinating conversation. :-) For any finite sequence of rolls, there's always the possibility (for fair dice) that further rolls will occur in such a way as to even out the distribution. Perhaps the question then becomes, how likely is that? I think that's what the chi square test tells us.
Anyways this is pretty much academic, though I do love a good academic talk! It's interesting how there isn't clear consensus as to whether the data points to unfair dice or is just insufficient. I got some different dice that are supposed to be higher quality, and will test them out.

Sorry, I should have been more specific. I'd like to know how the value of 3.96 bits per roll was arrived at from the distribution data.

I just received a pair of Precision Gaming 16-sided dice yesterday. I'll run the test on them. :-)
