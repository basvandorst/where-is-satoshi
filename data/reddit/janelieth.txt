You mean turn a exchange platform down? (That actually happens) 
Or do you mean turn all miners down? Or turn all nods down? (I don’t think that’s possible as long as the internet’s functioning)

See if this helps.

I don’t think so. You can’t use GDAX in Asia, except Singapore.

FYI, 80% of the trade volume in Japan is made up by leveraged trading. Leverage traders don’t/can’t hold. 
Here’s some data of trade volume. BitFlyerFX is leveraged trading platform.

Cause they can’t control Bitcoin?
Cause they want centralized tokens?

I found a web site selling properties in Bitcoin. 
I don’t think being a foreigner itself is a problem. The hard part is you have to be able to speak and read Japanese, or find someone to translate for you.

I personally believe the price drops because exchange platforms have to pull their money out. (That’s when people say “the whales are selling”.)
In January is was because China had made Bitcoin totally illegal. And the dip since March it’s because Japan is banning unregulated exchange platforms.
China banning Bitcoin is unpreventable.
For Japan, I’m not too worried because the government is actually very supportive of Bitcoin. The exchange platforms with licenses are invested by large companies and they are doing well. I believe the buyers (who were kicked out because the exchange platform they were using was banned) will come back to the market sooner or later.
Anyways, I’m holding and doing nothing because I’m a optimist and a terrible trader.
