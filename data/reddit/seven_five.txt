Yes, and from BTC to ETC even faster. Many millions more of BTC market cap have moved to ETC than from ETH.

It started as a pump by bitcoin trolls who wanted to introduce mayhem and questionability into Ethereum. It basically worked. The problem now is that it's performing even better than Bitcoin.

I know, it's crazy. Maybe the idea is that ETC has the immutability of BTC, but the features of ETH.
At first I thought it was passive-aggressive bitcoiners hoping to kill ETH, but now ETC seems to be its own thing. It rises even as ETH and BTC fall.
What has been created is not a competitor to ETH, but a new competitor to BTC.

Nobody seriously believes they are in a position to have to defend this point. I'm a little disappointed he felt the need. The ceaseless bashing here is obvious resentment and bias.

The white paper describes a technology, not a philosophy. Electronic cash is a goal, not the goal. The goal is an independent financial system, whether specified in the white paper or not, because that is what the technology enables. "Be your own bank" is the simplest encapsulation of this idea. Electronic cash will come later, when scaling technology enables it. There's no point in being a pedant about "electronic cash" just because you read it in the white paper. It just means Satoshi himself didn't know what he was creating. We all want "electron cash," but financial sovereignty is the precursor, the more fundamental idea, which Bitcoin enables. Be patient, instead of being such a fucking pussy.

I think in this case it is helpful to reframe your position as a computer science problem - specifically that of transmitting trusted information through an untrusted network, aka the byzantine generals problem, which has been a standing problem solved by recent progress. The solution, a technology known as the "blockchain", is what allows digital scarcity and thus cryptocurrency to be possible. Bitcoin is then just one instance of cryptocurrency, but it could also power decentralized prediction markets and other such things. This might be a more helpful approach.
@_date: 2015-06-23 01:41:49
Until everyone pays them, so then it increases, in turns until it's an unreasonable price for the average consumer.
At that point bitcoin fails as a currency and becomes a resolution book between large exchanges, and instead of an actual decentralized currency, we just have a basically traditional banking system that's unregulated. And while that's still cool, I think it falls way short of the original vision.
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:56:58
I'm clearly not berating you, I'm just telling you that what you're asking for does not make sense. If you want privacy and feel like you're not getting it? Sure, that's a reason. Or some bitcoin feature they're lacking? Fine. But that's not what you're saying. You're saying you want them to "voice objections to the US law" (apparently), which you don't know they're not already doing. You are literally making no point at all. Also how does pointing these things out in any way equate to "senseless and hypocritical and not a supporter of bitcoin"? That doesn't make any sense. I started out with honest dialogue but I'm starting to think you're a troll. Like, that's just not a real counterpoint, that's just name calling.

@_date: 2015-06-24 23:45:44
Is that really your argument?
Obviously it is impossible for anyone to "show you" what is going on inside coinbase besides themselves. But I wouldn't assume they're *doing their own business active damage* by staying silent or supporting these laws, instead of trying to fight to make things better and easier. There is literally no argument for them doing otherwise. I mean, show me they're *not* already fighting it.
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:31:34


Yeah, that's what I said. What makes you think they're not doing it already? Every bitcoin company is, to the extent that they can.
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:13:24
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. It sounds like you're trying to voice opposition to the law? But you're criticising the company which has to abide by said law. In actuality, that accomplishes nothing. The way to voice your objection to the law is to voice it to the *law makers*. Private companies already do what they can to combat the restrictions placed on them; if you want more to be done, you have to go to the source, not the victim. This is why none of your comments in this thread make any sense.
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:01:04
If he's e.g. selling them on localbitcoins then Coinbase has to shut him down, or else Coinbase itself gets shut down. They probably suspect something like this, hence the question they're asking, which he probably can't answer to.

Evidence can be lacking and ambiguous but still _called_ "ample and ambiguous". It literally means nothing how they reference it, if he wasn't charged for it. Charging would require them to prove "ample and ambiguous" instead of just characterizing it that way. It's a characterization.

You are wrong. They do initiate an ACH debit immediately. They determine the amount of bitcoin to give you on the day the ACH transfer clears. That is the difference.

Holy crap, it is more evident than ever that there is some serious voting-ring type stuff happening in this subreddit. This post having a score of 0 and all downvotes on the positive comments does not make sense otherwise.
Multisig is awesome, and it is basically everything security-conscious people (a large part of the bitcoin community) have been asking for. An API to use it is a great first step, and a potential UI on top of it would be killer.
Within a few minutes of being posted, the top comment is a not-very-helpful "don't care" with upvotes?

I don't think your milestone sounds particularly special though. If you did $10 in your first month, $10 in a day isn't exactly amazing.

Your analogy applies to bitcoin companies that are literally mining companies, but not the others. Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc are not spending their efforts acquiring bitcoin themselves, they're facilitating the delivery of it to users. Like a shovel, they are facilitating the delivery. There's an analogy here, but you're not doing it right.

In my experiences the price differences of this nature have been consistent over at least the past few weeks. I don't mean to be condescending - you may be reading my tone improperly.

In theory it could be true. But they'd need buyers frequently enough to cover the daily cashouts they're paying to merchants. That means these "otc" deals would need to fit very specific ranges at very specific times. For what, a few basis points? I doubt bitpay is doing this. But maybe if they answer this question in an AMA, or if there's any actual evidence or reason to believe they're doing it, then it'd be more believable.

I'm not sure you do. It is clear you are not just looking for the best price. If you were, you'd buy on Coinbase and sell on Circle. Since it's bitcoin it's interoperable and can just be send it between them.
Also the same argument you're making for Coinbase that "just because it is now, doesn't mean it always will be" applies to Circle as well, so I'm not sure you're being completely objective.

It sounds like sales tax doesn't apply, but since it's still property instead of currency, I assume you would need to pay capital gains instead. Which is generally a lot higher and more burdensome tax-wise.
Anyone else reading it the same way?
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:53:03
1. First and foremost, this is simply not true just based on the actions of people who currently own bitcoin. Some is saved, some is spent, some is given away for free, just like any other currency. So the reality has already proved this theory to be untrue.
2. Nobody knows the future of bitcoin, and whether or not it will continue to be adopted and therefore go up in price. If we knew this, it would become a self-fulfilling prophecy immediately.
3. *People want things*. The same impulse that makes you eat a candy bar now instead of an apple is what leads people to buy things they don't need, regardless of future consequence. Deflationary currency can't change this aspect of human nature. Not spending on things we don't need simply won't happen.
4. Money that isn't intended to ever be spend isn't actually worth anything. You save things so you can eventually spend it.
I don't and have never bought the argument that inflation spurs the economy. Superfically, maybe, in that obviously people want to get rid of something that will be worth less, so they are encouraged to either spend or invest. But this leads to dangerous things like the housing crisis, where people blindly invest in whatever - houses, sub-prime bonds - just to evade the slow devil of inflation. And how did *that* turn out? As a net positive? I think not! We've all been robbed. First by the bad investments, then by bailing out the banks who carried it out for us. All because the government decided that they had to fuck with our incentives and push us to go along with this kind of thing. It's a wreck. A total mess, and where and how people spend their money should not be in the scope of the government's interests anyway. (IMO, at least.)
I would argue that the spending and investments that come as a result of inflation are not actually genuine - they're not things people need or things that make the world better, it just pumps numbers that make everything seem like its growing. Real growth is in quality and availability of things, and inflation fucks with that by making us think it's all about numbers, and the numbers keep going up because there's more of them going around, so obviously it's great! But it's not. Because a country full of savers who didn't lose their houses and their money to the banks and the feds is much better off than a country full of people who had everything slid out from underneath them in their panic to escape those very people.
Inflation is just a numbers game meant to convince you the world is getting better when it's not, so that the people behind the curtain can continue to control your future and how you spend your money.

Context matters.
If you are a poor college student and "all in" means your $100 bank account, well that's not much.
If you have a mortgage and 3 kids who will rely on you for help with college, that's kind of dumb.
If you're a single, younger, steady-income person who will have more financial opportunities than just the money you have on hand right now - then it may be reasonable according to your risk/reward analysis.

Variety is good. I just expect US customers to want to be able to use a US exchange because it abides by local laws and, if permitted to exist, would be easier to interact with.
Most bitcoin users *happen* to be US-based, which is why I was wondering why Kraken wasn't bigger.
There is nothing in anything I said that implies I *want* the US to be the largest bitcoin community or that I am "uncomfortable" with other companies outside the US. Not sure why you're trying to mold my opinion into that - it's wrong.

If the accused is innocent, this leaves them at a disadvantage because they do not have time to prepare.

Makes sense. If it were true though I'd sort of expect some bitpay employee to come out and say "yeah, they get some btc from us." Maybe in the next AMA either company gives, you can ask them specifically about this. Sounds theoretically possible, I just doubt it's the case.

I mean, any number of scenarios can play out. How can either one of us say? I was just offering a possibility. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that over time, the value of bitcoin and the total number of transactions will increase, making the revenue that can be pulled from only transaction fees incentive enough to mine.

There are hundreds of addresses, *at least* one of which had a 99 btc transaction away from it.

This is exactly the kind of response I'd expect from a site that has flagged you as a potentially malicious user and just does not want you to know.

One of the beautiful things about Bitcoin is that when viewed through any generic, interoperable client, all bitcoins are valued equally.
When you start making it so that some bitcoins have alternative values, but only when viewed through a specific program - you break the interoperability.
At the core, these bitcoins are still just private keys. They will be exported and stored in cold storage. There is no program that "marks" your printed sheets of paper - you have to remember to do that yourself.
Inevitably, these coins will be re-imported to generic clients accidentally, and that additional value will be lost. It is likely this will occur sometimes even when the owner knows they're colored. Most cases people will probably responsible, but a massive loss of value and cause for confusion is bound to come from this.
And paper imports is just the most obvious case - sending colored coins to a generic wallet isn't exactly something that you can't do easily. You can do it just as easily as sending plain bitcoin (because that's what they are), so it will happen in more benign use cases as well.
It's like handing someone a $100 bill and saying, "this $100 bill is worth $500 because it represents a share in Google. But be careful, because you can only know this as long as you store it in your CashAsEquity wallet." Inevitably, someone will find themselves at a grocery store with an empty wallet and a $100 bill in their CashAsEquity wallet, and either due to not caring, being in a tight squeeze, or mismanagement, they will spend it on some food. And the value will be dispersed into the ether.
It will work somewhat because the people who are enthusiastic about it will sort of make it work, for them. But I doubt it will take off, because as time goes on it will be clear that too much value is being lost from too much confusion for it to be mass-adopted.

I don't see Apple Pay really taking off in a major way, but to the extent that it is used, I think the real benefit will be that it helps consumers get into the habit of using their phones to pay for things, which will mean a lot for future bitcoin adoption.
But mostly Apple Pay and bitcoin are just way too different for it really to have an impact on bitcoin adoption anyway. They're not really too comparable. So I think AP's existence is good for bitcoin, for the reason above.

The thing about that argument is that it sounds convincing when you read it, but we've already been through this in the past and mining has kept chugging along. Not only that, but those who do get into mining go in knowing that this will happen. I don't see why it would be different next halving.
You're also not accounting for higher transaction volume. If bitcoin becomes more popular over time, more transactions means more fee collecting. So the fee doesn't necessarily need to increase much (or maybe even at all), because the same amounts will be collected more frequently.

Yes, the idea is that the latter case would happen. I mean in 2140 they're only going to be mining tiny fractions of bitcoins anyway, nothing like what they're getting today, so for even that to be profitable bitcoin would have to be much more valuable, which would make mining for transaction fees a reasonable proposition at that point, 126 years from now.

No, this is wrong. Lots of people aren't smart enough to sell, store, or otherwise protect their stocks - they use a brokerage to do it on their behalf. This doesn't mean they don't deserve to trade stocks. It being difficult is colored coins' problem - not the users'.

Well it is clear that you're actually not doing your research, because the numbers don't add up. I pasted them for you right there, and you can do the math:
$376.02 * 1.01 = $379.78.
Circle price: **$379.95**.
Coinbase price *with fee*: **$379.78**.
It is cheaper to buy bitcoin on Coinbase.

I don't feel the same way - that it is a sudden cliff we will reach and fall off the edge of.
Blocks rewards will cut in half every four years. In the long term that seems sudden when most of it has already been released after 20 years, but at each specific step 1/2 is not that drastic, and combined with a theoretically increasing value over time and more rewarding tx fees, I imagine it will be a smooth easing, not a "problem" that is very close.

Circle sells bitcoin for a higher price. The fee is just hidden.  $376.02 on Coinbase vs. $379.95 on Circle as of this minute. That's *over* 1% more expensive. You're getting ripped off.

While I agree that mike is kind of hyperbolic, the movement to fork and move to a new client / team is a belief that is very widespread outside of him. Sure he was a in line with it, but he was more of a reflection of those ideas in the community than a generator.

The purpose of code being open sourced is so that it can be forked, ostensibly so that the forks could be put to practical use. If that doesn't happen, then outside of simple auditing, there is no point in it being open source, and it may as well be closed.
The threat of competition is not the same thing as competition existing. History has shown in basically every industry that progress tends to be stagnant or poorly directed until tangible options are available.

- Segwit doesn't even get 2x and Lightning network [has its own criticisms]( Sidechains have no practical implementation, and nobody really knows if they'll actually work.
- Hard forks allow clean transitions and simpler code. We've also already done it before and it wasn't an issue. Hard fork fears are mostly fear mongering. The real concern isn't technical; those who fear it know that if users are okay with hard forks, they may be okay with hard forking to a different client with a different team.
- What you're pointing to isn't really a "roadmap" so that's not a fair criticism. Actually seems like a neat way to gauge sentiment.
- Why? Remaining stagnant on all the things they're not moving on is itself a risk.
- Nobody's even trying to get us to VISA levels right now. You're not arguing against real people with this point. People want to just be able to use bitcoin without their transactions getting stuck for arbitrary amounts of time, and Core is failing us on that point. The 1mb limit is completely arbitrary - there is *zero* wrong with doubling it, and there is lots right about doing it. It's the opposite of a rush - a 2X increase is quite slow and is already overdue.
- "If it's that easy to fork, it failed." Huh? A fork is a technical change, one we've already seen happen easily. What failed previously was consensus. Also the fact that something is difficult is no reason not to do it if it's important.
- Even the link that you point to shows overwhelming consensus in Classic about keeping the 21 million limit. Demanding some change to make bitcoin workable isn't a slippery slope to doing everything willy nilly. You sound like my grandma saying "Legalize marijuana?! What next, heroin and sex during playground recess!!"
- Anyone who thinks this is a push from "blockchainers and banks" does not get the situation at all. The vast majority of actual users of bitcoin want these changes. We want them because bitcoin is not working, and we do not believe in the proposed changes by Core, and we do not believe in the ability of the team behind them to ever really consider the opinions of those outside themselves, and we want competition among clients and developer teams to change that. If they build the best client, they have nothing to worry about. So their fear and recent panic says a lot.

I actually agree with you - and that's why I support it. Classic is less about the 2mb increase than it is about the political power change and introduction of competition into the system. The supporters are hardly unknown however. Gavin managed bitcoin for a long time, and under his leadership things operated pretty smoothly. When he ceded control, we fell into this mess quickly. The reason they got support so quickly is because it's been building for basically the course of an entire year, not days.

It goes both ways. I've made comments criticizing core and get scorned by a new account that was created just to criticize me.
If accounts are old and have so many posts you can't page through them all... that sounds like a pretty real user to me. You're trying to group people into conspiracy efforts but it sounds like you're just describing regular reddit users.
"Everyone who is putting down core is either old or new." Well, you just described a generic reddit user. "The post suggest they are of the same age group and location West Coast USA" &lt;- how can you honestly determine this?
What you're describing is so generic that it seems like just regular users, which further makes me feel the response is widespread and grassroots, not some wild conspiracy.
I do believe that many of the new users that are posting exclusively about this topic are probably old-timers with strong opinions trying to be anon, but that's still not a conspiracy, it's just how people use reddit, on both sides of the argument.

This is exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about. I read it, and I was searching for something good here. But there isn't anything. It boils down to 2 points:
- Hard forks are dangerous and we haven't done them before. (We have, and it was basically painless.)
- It requires more than just one line of code to change, but we don't want to change those other lines, even though we're willing to do it for other pieces of tech.

You haven't refuted the fundamental point which is that 2MB is harmless and that it will help.
People make it out to sound like there's been a massive propaganda campaign to convince dumb people that 2MB is right. As someone who's had my own opinion changed over time, I can tell you that it has simply come from reading both sides. One consistently provides reasons for 2mb being helpful, and the other puts forward arguments that just aren't convincing. At a certain point, even as a lay person, if your IQ isn't 70 or below, you pretty much do understand what you need to, and you can decide what side to support from a rational, informed perspective. I believe this is how the vast majority of users have come to their opinion. It's the same mindset that got them into bitcoin in the first place. Being interested in technology, being open to new ideas, and researching them. Believe it or not, this same methodology is the one that has lead to most people desiring a 2MB block size. It's not propaganda, it's informed research.

This. It's like a tech company without product managers. The programmers run wild building esoteric things that please themselves but don't solve simple user issues.
Companies, who actually have to survive in a market where they compete against entities with similar but varying products, have evolved to have these pieces of a business because understanding of practical product use among users, and how to apply dev talent to solving those problems, is generally something programmers are not well equipped to do on their own.
Imagine if web standards were decided solely by Microsoft, and IE didn't have a PM team. Our internet would look like total shit. This is the position Core currently takes for granted.
The fact that there is no real competition among bitcoin clients should scare everybody. If they were, what would they compete on? Come up with a list. Those are the things users want. Is Core working on those things? No? Then you know they don't have your interests as a bitcoin user in mind and they have no reason to.

Hey man, I'm not trying to spread FUD. Like I said, I am in favor of a block size increase.
What I don't understand is why this poorly understood and little-known-about feature is being lumped in with the block size increase in XT.
And what else is there? These aren't the only two changes.
If the motivation were honestly to fix a pending disaster due to block size, that would be the only change, and these other things that there also isn't consensus on yet wouldn't be getting slyly pulled in.
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:12:50
I am someone who is in favor of a block size increase. After all the debate, nobody was able to convince me that it was a bad idea.
But this article actually does convince me that XT itself is a potentially malicious fork. I urge you to read it if you haven't.
Basically, XT does not just introduce a block size increase. It also adds several other features that are not being talked about, because they're being overshadowed by the block size debate.
The most important of these are the de-anonymizing and blacklist features which make it easy to ban nodes from the network and drastically reduce privacy.
Read the code - the actual code snippets with comments are in the article. It's almost unbelievable.
I am for a block size increase. 8MB blocks increasing over time sounds great to me. But the XT fork itself is actually starting to sound like poison, for the reasons outlined in this article.
XT should be redone to only introduce one new feature: the block size increase. Then I could support it. As it stands, I don't think I can anymore.
IMO if the blockstream guys don't want XT to become a thing, they should be way more public about this angle of the fork.

No, they just follow regular consumer news. Get over it a bit, you know? Education is something we all need to promote. If you think people should know, help them learn, don't blow up at them on reddit.

Bitcoin Cash is just a separate currency, doing its own thing. When Bitcoin fixes its shit, it will rise again as well. I have faith. People here should focus on Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:23:06
BIP 101 and XT are two different things.
BIP 101 could potentially be merged into bitcoin core directly.
XT is an alternative implementation *which also includes de-anonymizing and transaction blocking features*.
XT is not the only way to increase the block size and it should not be adopted strictly because it is using the block size debate as a way to introduce malicious code into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:57:47
There is no war. The war is over. Bitcoin Core won, and is Bitcoin now. The Core team is free to proceed with technological advancements without concern of a hard fork, because the BCH hardfork is in the past, and the B2X hardfork has been canceled.
It's pointless to compare the prices now. BCH is its own thing. Just let it be, and focus on BTC. Otherwise you just sound bitter.

This is such a lame excuse. is not a community for the core reference client, it is a community for the network, everyone involved, and everything else bitcoin-related. XT is now interfacing with the real, global bitcoin network. It is part of Bitcoin. By your logic, discussion about bitcoin core should go in Why aren't you pushing that, too?

A large group of users here would have you believe that bank-like features are the devil and that you are literally evil and/or a fucking idiot for seeking them out. They use this perspective to shit all over companies providing them like Circle and Coinbase.
And yet as a rational individual, you see the value. Cool.
You can try btcjam, though the verdict is still out on whether you'll gain or lose. You can lend on bitfinex, but that may be a little complicated. True easy-to-use savings accounts aren't readily available yet, but hopefully we'll start seeing some of them in the next few years.

@_date: 2018-02-11 21:58:10


This isn't true, Coinbase just outsourced their trades to other exchanges. GDAX wasn't the first exchange after MtGox...
And yes, I know about slippage. Anyone with any trading experience at all will know how to avoid it at scale. This is what OTC is for. You match whales directly so that they *do not* affect the market. Even if the market was your only source, you spread your purchases out over time and/or buy short-term dips, not just make one big market order.
Whales and people like Draper are successful because they know how to *avoid* slippage. No trader who knows what they're doing just goes and makes one giant above-market order.
Paying a premium for a large amount all at once would be so dumb. That just means you could buy on the open market until the slippage brought the price up to the supposed auction premium price. Then you would have (1) gotten cheaper coins, and (2) ultimately not have paid any premium, since you made the price rise!
All other government auctions of things that are seized (like houses) are sold at a discount. If you weren't buying at a discount, you would have already gotten it from the market itself. I don't know why people want to believe so hard that someone would pay above-market for BTC, it doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:25:40
No, the bitcoin were acquired for below market. There would be no other reason for participating. What's the PR purpose of owning bitcoin? Tim Draper certainly hasn't appeared to try to milk it.
Some people here really want to believe that savvy billionaires with histories of making smart behind-the-scenes investments love bitcoin so much that they wanted to make a large volume purchase above market value as a PR move. That's not how it works...

"Transfers and withdrawals can take up to one week"
This isn't native send/receive functionality in Robinhood, it's a one-off manual process that requires you to contact customer support and wait for them. So technically, in a way, you'll be able to export, but nobody would deal with that process regularly if you're trying to buy to own. It's not really in the category of support that I'd consider send/receive functionality.

That literally makes no sense. The open market is already a large bidding war. If any of the parties involved had wanted bitcoin at the market price, they literally could have gone to the market and acquired it.
The bitcoin here were sold below market. That's pretty much the whole point of this kind of auction.

I don't think it's against the principles of to put a low percentage (like 5%) of your investment in to something high risk. If it loses, the loses are minimal; if it wins, it wins big. A small percent of high risk is part of a well-balanced portfolio.

Basically. You can't connect a bank account without giving up certain of your ID. Which is the only reason to use Coinbase in the first place.

"Let's encourage people to farm accounts by giving away free money to unverified strangers on the internet."
You underestimate what people will do to get a free $0.25. I used to run a faucet that gave out $0.10 based on unique verified email address and had to reduce it down to satoshis because every time I blocked the way accounts were being farmed they'd come up with a new method and I got tired of it after months.

Overstock uses Coinbase, not BitPay. Additionally, they never "collected" bitcoin, they always converted it immediately to US currency.
@_date: 2015-04-17 04:58:26
Because it is not stupid easy. For example, how are they going to pull your coins when you do a sell if they don't own the private key? They can't.
Your case is important to you but not most people. You can always go create that company yourself and see how much traction it gets. My guess is that that functionality would not be a differentiating factor for the vast majority of people.
Like somebody else pointed out, just move your coins off site when you get them. It's basically that simple.
@_date: 2015-09-25 08:25:46
Why not? The companies don't have to exist to still be a threat in the future. The unfortunate reality is that if they don't try to take them now, then a patent troll could acquire them, and then troll them with the very patents they could have applied for. It makes absolute sense.
@_date: 2015-04-07 03:32:06
Users of Coinbase, Circle, whatever, use it *willingly*. It isn't an "invasion" if you agree to their terms, which you must to create an account. If you don't like it, go somewhere else. And I know you'll respond "okay, I *will*!" and that's great and I'm happy for you. But please also recognize that the majority of people who want to buy bitcoin easily see this as an acceptable tradeoff for a service that would otherwise not exist.
@_date: 2015-04-17 05:05:16
The value is that they act as gateways. As long as you can send your coin off site, which they all let you do, they have massive utility.
@_date: 2015-09-22 08:32:14
How is it a game changer? You said:


Can you explain this? Because I don't think it's true. Sending USD to USD is just moving money in a bank. In fact, not even that. The USD just stays in the bank and Circle's database gets updated. Blockchain not utilized (or needed). Same with EUR, when they get it.
The more interesting question is, will they allow you to send USD to a EUR user? That would be kind of interesting, but not really a game changer. And that could, but doesn't need to, use bitcoin underneath. In fact the use of bitcoin in this scenario would be less valuable for anything technical it provides, USD -&gt; BTC -&gt; EUR would just be a way to try to subvert international money regulation that would prevent direct USD -&gt; EUR. So I guess good that BTC exists, but not exactly a manifestation of the grand vision I always had.
So really we have a venmo that lets you deposit and withdraw in bitcoin if you want. I think that's pretty cool. I think they may be successful with it. But I also don't think it's that revolutionary.
@_date: 2015-04-08 06:36:58
Coinbase doesn't generally start cancelling buys after you've had a lot of successful purchases in the past so something makes me think you're not telling the whole story here.
Are you using multiple accounts? Did you apply to be a merchant and not fill out your business info properly? Did you send any transactions which would seem suspicious? (Have notes that mention drugs, etc.) There are other possibilities.
If you genuinely can't think of anything like this, or anything that would have changed on your account to provoke a change, I actually have a hard time believing your being honest.
@_date: 2015-04-17 08:26:28
"no harder than sending to their address". Huh?
By "sell" I mean when you sell bitcoin. This means the website *gets* your bitcoin somehow, and gives you fiat for it instead. How do you expect them to get your bitcoin if they can't take it?
As stated above, there is already a solution: just move your coins off-site.

I don't think this is right. What I mean is that sort of by definition, the key innovation of bitcoin must have been something that Nakamoto brought to the table.

The problem is overstated since you can also just check the network requests your browser is making, which are way easier to parse. You don't need to read the javascript to observe that sufficient private keys are not being sent to their servers.
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:06:24
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:19:52
You're conflating ideas though. You're right that it's not a "community-based, peer reviewed open source project," but it's an equivocation to suggest that not being those things means that the solution is necessarily, in fact, insecure.
All of the keys are generated client-side. You can audit the javascript yourself. If you don't want to trust something like that, well, don't.
But answering OP's question in a way that implies Coinbase controls enough private keys to move the bitcoin in your multisig wallet is a lie.

Acknowledging that bitcoin is decentralized doesn't mean we can't ask the exchanges to make changes.
Decentralization/anarchy is not the same thing as happily accepting whatever people want to do.
Exchanges are free to make whatever product they want, and everybody else is free to criticize it and ask for changes.  Asking them to change instead of waiting for market alternatives does not make the incumbents "central" entities any more than they already were.
There is no hypocrisy here.

That's my point though: you think you're changing things, but you're not.  Nothing has changed.  Their product is not different.  You complaining about your place in line is not an indicator of a larger thing that they have to fix.
*Nothing* has resulted from this public display than simply your jump ahead in line.  You think it's representative of some sea change, but after they take time away from people who are waiting patiently in line to answer you, they just have to go back to their normal queue and keeping nailing those cases out.
There is simply nothing you can say or complain about on social media that somehow reduces a company's queue size.  They've already stated multiple times how they're addressing it.  What in reality are you expecting?
So, again, your public rants serve no other purpose than to actually *distract* from the issue (answering cases in their queue), and only serve *you personally*, not make anything better for people in general. Get real: you can't justify bitching on social media as some noble cause, you're just preventing everyone else's cases from being answered earlier, cause they've got to deal with you first.

Obviously neither of us believes either of these scenarios.  My point was that Coinbase isn't going to succeed because Fred Wilson is a VC.  If it succeeds, it'll be because the team built an awesome product, and possibly that VC helped a bit in making connections or promoting it.  The lion's share of the effort and respect is deserved by the team.

Everyone keeps saying this, but it's been a few months now.  If these massive increases were people looking to get *out* of bitcoin, they'd have to convert back to fiat at some other exchange, which would equally depress the price.  That doesn't appear to be happening.
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:17:41
I think in reality most users of Bitcoin don't have a fully deep understanding of it.  We have enough knowledge for it to make sense to us, but not to recreate the whole protocol on our own if it were to disappear somehow.  We understand the general concept, but not the specifics. (Unless you're a programmer.)
I don't necessarily think most people will need to know the specifics of Ripple to use it, either.  But the general concept and most common functions have to be simple.  Right now those are kind of cloudy, and I think that's a big part of the issue.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:39:51
Of course you don't.  Brats don't care about being brats, otherwise they'd simply stop being brats.
Meanwhile, this thread is generally full of praise for coinbase during times when the price isn't swining wildly and people aren't feeling jipped by the same high risk cancellations *that happen all the time, even when the price is going down*.
It isn't actually possible for Coinbase to sustain as a business unless the majority of their customers are helped and satisfied.  Bitcoin isn't big enough to rely on revenue from first-timers every day. They need repeat customers and for that to happen, they need to be letting the majority of sales go through.
What do you mean by "or nothing gets said" anyway?  Write into support, that's saying something.  And when you say "nothing gets done" you think you mean that nothing changes w.r.t. everyone's accounts and purchases, but in reality you only mean w.r.t. your own. It's petty and stupid and polluting the forum.  Unless what you're complaining about is actually relevant to a bug or principle of the site that doesn't affect edge cases or "high risk" users (i.e. not what you're talking about), please let the grownups use the forum to discuss real matters.  Thanks.

"The market" is not the same thing as "this one specific exchange." Coinbase does most of its matches internally; I assume this is the market rate on *their* market, which takes the other big exchanges as a factor, but not the only one.  Gox is @ 209, why isn't Coinbase even higher than it is?  If you were trying to sell instead of buy, that's exactly what you'd be arguing: "Gox is at 200+!!! Why can't Coinbase get in line with the market and let me sell that high???"

Any exchange needs to have a way to maintain a cash balance.  That requires a banking relationship with private credentials.  I would love for someone to explain to me how that can exist as open source or p2p.  Secure bank information must be held centrally.

The graphics are cool, but what is the actual gameplay?  The preview just looks like a bunch of abstract shapes flying around.

Twist: "coinbasepanic" purposely made the purchase himself, and either (1) didn't realize his lack of funds, or (2) is actually trying to scam Coinbase himself, and is creating this thread as some sort of attempt at public evidence that he is innocent.
It fits the data.
Coinbase probably gets this kind of stuff all the time.  The only ones who will really be able to tell what happened are them.

There are multiple senses in which something can be considered "secure."  The argument for bitcoin security has always been about its resilience to hacking and double spending, *not* user error.  I don't think anyone has ever made the claim that the raw bitcoin protocol is user friendly and without risk.  In fact, most of the bitcoin community acknowledges that raw bitcoin is not very user friendly at all, and that you should take great measures to be very safe, using backups, etc.  So who exactly are you criticizing?
As bitcoin develops, services will be built on top of the raw protocol that do actually make it easier to use.  For example, blockchain.info or coinbase.  They may not be as easy to use as your commerce bank account, but they're the first step.  Banks have been around for hundreds of years.  Bitcoin? 4.
One of the great things about bitcoin is that *you don't have to use it*.  There is enough information out there about how risky bitcoin is that everyone who starts getting into it, generally speaking, should know what they are.  If they don't, it's irresponsibility on their part.  Who puts 20k into something they don't know how to responsibly manage?
Bitcoin is risky.  Sometimes risk leads to loss.  If you are using bitcoin, you are implicitly accepting that risk, and that potential for loss.

As someone who is familiar with bitcoin but not an expert, I don't understand why sending 12 bitcoins in OPs case also sent the remaining 88 as "change" to another, new address.  Was this some option that OP selected?  I've always been able to send small amounts from my address and keep the remainder right where it was, at the same address.  Is it different for brainwallets?  Why?
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:30:22
For the reasons I mentioned.
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:38:41
No, it's because these are age-old things that everyone already knows about.
Also you're front page anyway so I'm not sure what you're complaining about.

"...the government also accused the alleged Silk Road mastermind, known by the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, of hiring a hitman to kill six people."
Different.  Title is wrong.

Seems like you have to take their word if you use their site for any other purpose... which most people here do.  So someone would have to explain why you can trust them for a hot wallet but not a cold one.
@_date: 2013-05-28 22:37:06
You don't.  If you import back to Coinbase, it'll take the full funds from the wallet.  If you're importing somewhere else, that sounds like a general paper wallet problem you've got to figure out.

The question is why we should consider Apple's "rules" valid in the first place.  They shouldn't be.  They are not in the interest of the consumer.

Can you even get USD into bitstamp?  I really don't know - how tough is it in comparison to Gox?
Not that this whale was necessarily using USD but just curious.

Doesn't Fred Wilson just sit in his office and throw money at companies? Doesn't seem like he's responsible much beyond that.

Ah, gotcha.  This makes sense.  Thanks.

It would become more valuable due to limited supply.

But all of the addresses that you send from, have to have received the funds from a trail going back to the address that originally had them.  So it's traceable, isn't it?
It's only untraceable if the original address sends into a pool that is much larger than total bitcoin amount being laundered, then new transactions of different amounts are sent from the pool to new addresses.  If there isn't some pool in the middle that ambiguates everything, it'd be transparent.  Right?
You also couldn't merge all the coins back into a new address of the same balance or it'd be too coincidental and immediately suspect.

All I'm saying is it's like the bratty 5 year old who can't stop crying about being first in line, and then he gets it, because he was a snotty brat.  Gross.

You're asking people to input a private key into a site that has no reputation, no link to source code, no "about" for info on the creator, and doesn't even load over https...
It almost seems *designed* for phishing.
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:32:22
Did you use a shortlink or username or something other than the generated identifier to login to your account?  Just wondering, maybe there's a correlation between this and hacks.

You're not even patient enough to wait for a ticket response, how can you possbily be aware of how it's performing and improving over time?  You also have no idea of what fraction of users are improperly marked as high risk.  You only know that it happens to *some*, including yourself, and it seems you're extrapolating that into meaning *everyone*, or at least a near majority, which wouldn't make any sense at all, because if that were true Coinbase could not stay in business.
You're just making a lot of assumptions that all add up as justifications for being annoying, but they're all wrong.

Thousands of little $19 transactions actually is a high risk situation.

Dude, getting burned by an algorithm and then personally bitching on like a little girl and personally calling out staff isn't going to help you.

What should be visible?  They're hiding what?
People don't have to seek out a solution.  Again, that's the point.  They answer everything.  If you're an impatient whiner you complain to get extra attention, and delay everyone else who's waiting patiently.

Assuming the person got their money in before Gox started halting withdrawals (which *is* what we're assuming), that wouldn't be a loss at all, as the price on gox at the time was less than $100.  Combined with the fact that the person would have to know that the Gox price is currently inflated, due to exactly what they did (buy btc and export), I don't see why the spread between Gox and Bitstamp would be a reasonable factor in not selling now.
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:01:27
What's the ETA on that.
