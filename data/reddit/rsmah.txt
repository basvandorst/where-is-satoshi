The SEC does not approve or regulate most common exchange traded derivatives (i.e. futures and options) -- they are regulated by the CFTC.  The SEC does have oversight over some more exotic derivative instruments (e.g. equity-based dividend swaps) but the CFTC still has oversight authority over more common swaps (e.g. interest rate swaps). Most other derivatives are traded OTC and, barring some filing requirements, the SEC is not involved.

Actual revenues or transaction volume?  I suspect transaction volume.

Almost all bitcoin casinos are illegal in the USA because of the Federal Wire Act of 1961 (18 U.S.C.) and because most states also ban private gambling except in certain narrow circumstances.  All of these laws are phrased in such a way that gambling for \*anything\* of value is illegal, be it dollars, chickens or bitcoins.

And yet people routinely trust 10x or 100x that much USD to third parties.  Think about that.

My sister and her daughter live in NYC (brooklyn).  When my niece was a bit younger, her and a friend had a lemonade stand (in front of their apartment building) during two or three summers.  They had no trouble with the city or cops.  Cops even stopped and bought a cool drink or three once in a while.  Hell, even some of the neighborhood tough guys thought it was cute and bought a lemonade.  It all depends on the context.
