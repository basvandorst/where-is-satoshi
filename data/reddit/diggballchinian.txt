for technical question purposes, how can we know a game wont steal your private keys if you link the wallet to it?
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:44:56
I hate long reviews. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:41:44
I had same concern. None of  my other wallets did this. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:36:21
Obviously you would want an effective system if you're paying for it.
@_date: 2014-09-23 05:02:40
too late?
@_date: 2014-08-24 01:41:06
thanks for the info
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:49:33
If we can't trust it, it shouldn't fucking be there.
@_date: 2014-03-17 05:41:24
get help

Bitcoins are very stable when you exchange it for dollars or giftcards. It works perfectly in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-08-29 05:46:20
Since mining is out of the picture for most, and buying is a hurdle for common citizens, there needs to be more popular opportunities to earn or win btc. More people who acquire btc casually will be willing to spend on products.

Has anyone built a web application using toshi yet? 
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:28:14
Why would someone visit .bit domains? Is this a browser extension, wheres the download link? I'm just asking questions.
@_date: 2014-03-22 04:40:00
BTC isn't just for financial speculators looking to make money. There is a place for merchants who just want an easy payment system with low fees. In this case the protocol will be useful, as it is now a standard technology.
*based on my understanding, which may be shit.

At this point, the only purpose Litecoin serves is dumping.
@_date: 2017-04-23 03:59:34
The price went up 400% in a short time period because the world really cares about segwit? People are coming in here to hype litecoins because they want to get rich. It is just a matter of when they will be dumped.
@_date: 2017-04-23 02:00:04
Nobody uses litecoins. Why is this pump scheme allowed here?

Why would anyone listen to a guy who wants to abolish the position of president, and probably the country altogether
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:21:30
To clarify my question "why would any one listen to a guy..." was in context of finding the best person for a job. If you do not even believe the concept of president should exist, your opinion on the best man for the job should be questioned. Not even saying the opinion is wrong. 
As for why anyone would listen to a person who wants to take your money and rule a geographic area- its an election process, that is the point. We are voluntary participants.
@_date: 2015-04-23 03:04:47
They don't come after you with guns and bust in your door to lock you in a cage. They keep contacting you, wondering why you aren't paying the agreed price for the services and infrastructure provided. When you turn out to be a lone nut who believes they don't need to pay, they will arrest you. Same thing happens when you go into Walmart and take without paying. There are many geographic areas separated by borders to choose from. I have never been convinced we are not participating voluntarily. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:28:48
It isn't nuts to not want to pay for those problems, I get it as a form of protest. But I see the concept of tax as the price for services that is inevitable. You're only as free as your choices, and reality limits land area and resources. In that sense I believe we participate voluntarily in the context of realistic nature. I can be wrong, I can be explaining it poorly, but I just cant see some feasible ideological purity in this way.

Bitmit was the best, and it was a very inconvenient time for me to see them to close.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:11:47
This is horrible. I thought the site was really going big.
@_date: 2013-11-02 19:24:01
Made me think of this. :)

My wallet on Mac OSX has been stuck with an unconfirmed balance, after reindexing blocks. What do I do?
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:28:38
its out of sync, and its been reindexing blocks on disk for days now. It often becomes corrupted and needs to rebuild the whole blockchain, but it has never been stuck for this amount of time.

Are the coins stored in wallet.dat or is it just the key to access the value? If i backup wallet.dat file to an external harddrive, and then receive more bitcoins to my address, is the offline wallet.dat backup able to be updated if accessed on a new PC?
