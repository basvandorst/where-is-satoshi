That's a bad mentality. Sure sometimes taxes are not well spent but don't forget that taxes paid for the road you drive on etc. etc.
Don't NOT market bitcoin as a way to avoid paying taxes. Taxes are both important AND the reason the government will hunt down bitcoin if we decide to use it like that.

I'm on my phone so I can't type the whole explanation but they basically flooded tor with enough nodes and requests to make sure that some of the requests go through their nodes only and that made them able to see the entire route their requests took. This isn't something that can be fixed easily, and not merely a "tor vulnerability" .

For profit or not, I like the quality of content there. It's for coders/designers/entrepreneurs etc. 
This post is uninteresting, uninformative the tattoo quality is crap and just basically useless. 
I'm trying to keep the things I like just the way they are. Sue me.

Don't post crap like this on hacker news again, please.
