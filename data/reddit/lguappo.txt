I was struck by the same. It seemed like a stage intentionally designed for him to "subtly" imply with pauses and innuendo that he was more deeply involved than he was willing to say, and also to publicly argue with Nick Szabo who most think is Satoshi. Given that this is crypto, it seems like the likeliest explanation is that he is a scammer and some of the people who organized and promoted the panel are in on it. Hilarious that he got raided the same day the articles came out (which he/partners may have planted  Whatever Aus police say, that timing is not coincidental. I think they knew what he was up to, and those working with him, and the truth will come out in short order.

Interesting. Which new digital currency?
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:44:57
Interesting. Cool that he was willing to correct the error so quickly. It seems weird, though, that he felt the sentence was still just as true talking about 277 mill volume vs 8.4 mill volume. I'm no expert, but I'm surprised 277 mill isn't considered decent sized volume by cap markets standards. I guess they are playing in a whole different league on WS. 277 mill here, 277 mill there ... pretty soon you're talking about real money.

Yeah and I thought coinmarketcap showed well over 200 million. Does anyone know the explanation for the different figures? Hard to know who is hyping and who is underplaying it with their methodology.
@_date: 2016-05-08 11:03:15
No. He couldn't, and he isn't. Claiming that is his next play, but it won't wash. He has the intelligence of a used car salesman. He can't pull this off.

Sure they are. They are no less free than predators. Both are enslaved to appetite, but both are free to roam:

Great post. I disagree that he cares about money more than credibility though (I don't think he really cares about either). It is a common misconception that frauds and sociopaths care about money. They don't. If they did, they would accumulate money in less risky ways, in ways that aren't as likely to get their money confiscated when they are inevitably jailed by ATO. What it is really about is people with extremely fragile egos who are compelled to work day after day throughout their lives to construct a sense of superiority based on ability to manipulate. It is actually really, really sad. These people are empty, unable to experience joy. Their lives literally consist of nothing but an endless, ultimately doomed quest to prove that they are smarter than every single person they meet.

Man, this guy is trying sooooo hard to be an international man of mystery. Can't we all just agree to pretend to be impressed so he feels better about himself?
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:47:47
That's my thought too. Why in "the coming days?" Why not today, right now? Because it drags this on for a little while longer, and in his scammer's heart he figures he can come up with a new excuse a few days from now, and then a new one, and so on. He doesn't need to convince everyone, but just to create a sense that it is possible he is Satoshi. That will be enough to get book contracts, manipulate prices, maybe get some unlucky folks to invest in some phantom "start-up" of his.

His business accomplishments are nonexistent. Everything that's been fact checked (supercomputer for example) turns out to have been a lie. The more scrutiny, the more you'll find hes accomplished exactly zero except some failed scams and plagiarism in his life. I also quite readily deny he is smart. He strikes me as a moron whose only talent is shamelessness and an inability to recognize that others are laughing at his idiocy. ATO is onto him and he is heading to jail. His ambitions far exceed his talents.
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:40:42
He's been "leaking" "information" about himself since December and begging newspapers to pay attention to him ever since. He's been staging demonstrations for weeks. And despite insisting he wouldn't give any further proofs and doesn't want recognition, he suddenly realized today it would be helpful to move coins? Lol @ him and anyone ridiculous enough to shill for him. The compulsive behavior of sociopaths who dont recognize how foolish they look is hilarious.
@_date: 2016-05-03 12:20:54
After having made himself look such an idiot with those "leaks" back in December, I'm really not sure why CW thought he was smart enough to pull this off. This is a man whose ambitions far exceed his talents.
@_date: 2016-05-08 11:06:46
It's not that he comes off as an ass. It's that he comes off as incompetent. Satoshi may well have been an ass, but he wasn't incompetent.
@_date: 2016-05-08 11:10:09
We should dismiss it, because it is the obvious play in this half baked con: claim a connection to a dead guy who can't deny, then seek money now based on false promise he has assets (Satoshi coins) tied up in trust until 2018. It's too bad he couldn't have thought of a smarter con, because this one is way too obvious too work. This guy's future career options include selling used cars and snatching handbags from old ladies. Beyond that, he's going nowhere fast (except maybe jail for tax fraud).

Thanks Alpacasallday. Small ruminants ftw!
@_date: 2016-05-08 13:32:46
Right, and i don't think you understand how nonsensical it is to say that he *might* be connected to this or that. It is not necessary to find disproof of every ridiculous thing that might have happened. What is beyond doubt is that this guy is a fraud and an established con (and apparently not a very good one). Anything that hints at him having done anything with his life other than rip off old ladies should be assumed to be false. Certainly, in logical terms, the burden of proof is on anyone who wishes to plant the idea that this incompetent con is doing anything other than he's always done: con incompetently.
@_date: 2016-05-02 21:12:57
Yeah, that article seemed to have a healthy amount of skepticism, while reporting on a newsworthy (though false, IMO) claim.
@_date: 2016-05-07 03:34:56
Yeah, A for effort and F for execution. Poor guy just doesn't have the skills to pull this off. They aren't done though. The next phase is trying to convince people that he was part of a group of Satoshis and his access to the coins is held in trust. I feel sorry for anyone who fronts this halfwit wannabe scammer money based on this claims. Hopefully ATO wraps up their investigation and jails him before any real harm is done.

Other things his being a conman doesn't disprove: he invented post-it notes; gravity is 30% weaker in his backyard; he was the best playdoh sculptor his kindergarten teacher ever saw.

Not the first time he was accused of plagiarism. Check out this blog post from 2012:
This guy is a joke. There is nothing even slightly convincing about his act.

Serious point about sheep: they are a species that has thrived all over the world. There are many more sheep than there are wolves. Herd mentality is a viable survival strategy refined over millennia by evolution. Why all the hate for our wooly friends?

I will be shocked if it actually happens. But I've been shocked before. If he does somehow provide definitive proof, I wonder how long it will take people to move from "OMG Craig Wright is too shitty of a person to be Satoshi Nakamato" to "OMG Satoshi is a shitty person."
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:10:33
And also skill. Wright was a dumbass and an obvious con. Madoff was a little brighter and more sophisticated. Crypto is lucky that way - some of the most incompetent cons in history seem to have been drawn to crypto.

The person who made that video is on Twitter (madinmelbourne) and she was hyping CSW for many months prior to the first "leaks" using the same vague "i know something but can't say what" kind of vibe. She was also very friendly/perhaps involved with some people who perpetrated other altcoin scams. So knowing that info, his being in her video is yet one more suspicious sign to me. At this point, my approach to crypto is to assume the worst. I basically think the culture of crypto has failed, and that it is overrun by people who have some very deep psychological problems around issues of power, whether it is the perceived power of TPTB or a jealous desire to become manipulators themselves. CSW is a shining example IMO, though not a particularly smart one. For blockchains to change the world, I frankly think the best bet is for the tech to be coopted by the mainstream and move beyond this small circle of ill-intentioned clowns.
Totally unrelated, but I just found out the *second* Wachowski brother went transgender too. Holy cow.
