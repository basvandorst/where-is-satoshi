C'mon man, when someone called Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core" besides Roger?
What have you done to correct this "mistake"? Fired the guy ?

OK, i'll buy it. I like you, and i was new on my company once, i caused +/- USD100.000 in losses in my first year with a simple mistake (blocked a huge cellphone site for 14 days).

Daniel Fraga is a real life hero, but later he was suporting bcash, what made me feel bad for him, if he traded BTC to bcash.
Maybe hes not that rich like we think, if he really commited to bcash.
