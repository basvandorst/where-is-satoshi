Sorry, but everyone watched her video and don't think she's lying. 
You can start fixing the situation by apologizing and sending back the 1BTC back to her that you stole from her.

I thought something was 'off' when I first saw this... she didn't seem to really know what was going on in the interviews.... ~~This Ingo Pless guy sounds like a total asshole who manipulated her.~~
We should help her out if we can. 
EDIT: Plot thickens with a twist...

Why don't you explain how any why you are involved in this ??  
If the article is lying and you are receiving all of this bad press, why don't you write a request for them to remove it and tell your side of the story??

1. How did you find out about bitcoin?
2. How long did you mine for?
3. Why didn't you move these earlier?
4. Why didn't you sell at $1, $10, $100, or $1000?
Almost unbelievable...

I'll be that guy.
You gonna return the 3000 Bitcoins back to hashfast customers who deserve them about 3000 times more than you do?

And the big question..
5. How many blocks did you mine?  
Guessing you were 1% = 1.4 blocks per day. Maybe you had that for 12 months? ~500 blocks? Am I close?

That's theft. They need to give people an option to withdraw before they increase withdrawal fees by *ANY AMOUNT*.  Imagine if they said it was 10%?

I like how the only way this made it to the bitcoin front page  and got upvoted was that the title didn't use the word "Ethereum".
This was the week-long Ethereum Developers Conference that happened in London last week.
Mods should delete this right away!! What happens if Ethereum keeps gaining momentum ?!?! It's a threat to Bitcoin just like XT is... We need to ban hammer all Ethereum stories and just act like it's not growing at all.
Please everyone, downvote ASAP!! Don't buy Ether!  (/s)?

1. Will regular wallets (breadwallet, mycelium, blockchain.info, etc) be able support moving BTC to the Liquid sidechain and creating txs on it, so that the average bitcoin user can take advantage of settlement in N seconds?  Or will only the participating exchanges be able to create transactions?   
2. Will the tx fee to Blockstream on Liquid be lower or higher than current mining fees on the Bitcoin network?
3. If Liquid has lower fees, and near instant settlement, why would anyone want to keep their BTC on the main chain?
4. If Liquid has lower fees, isn't it a conflict of interest for Blockstream developers to make sure that blocks stay small on the Bitcoin network so that the fees are high, so that users move their BTC to Liquid so that they pay lower fees to Blockstream?
5. Will anyone be able to create assets (IOUs) on Liquid, or only participating exchanges?

1.  Becuase transactions are virtually instant, retailers etc will want to use it as long as they trust the validators.
2. Their blog says blockstream will take a fee on each tx

Great Summary. Thanks.
