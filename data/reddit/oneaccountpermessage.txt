Everybody understands its a terrible situation, and that solving this is going to take years not days.

I have been an administrator of a very large site for more than a decade and I can tell you it is very tempting to sometimes ignore clients that have a very negative tone, and of which you know you cannot help them right now. I can imagine bitfinex is still in internal discussion with synapsepay and bitgo, and any clients affected by this can probably not be helped until they sort out internal disagreements, not replying is often the best solution, because any answer will only cause these unsatisfied customers to make angry forum posts.

I always keep my coins in secure cold storage, but yesterday I decided to sell some bitcoin as a hedge. 
So I sent my bitcoin to bitfinex, and immediately sold 90% of them. So I had USD balance + some bitcoin left (~10%). 4 hours later it seems my bitfinex associated wallet got drained (All of it, not just 90%), does that mean Bitfinex attributes this loss to me or to the person who bought the bitcoins?

So if 96,000 BTC + 24,000 BTC was stolen and 73800 BTC are remaining, does that not mean that 61.5% of your bitcoin was not stolen?

Well judging from how other exchanges handled this sort of thing:
A loan means an agreement that the user who borrows BTC pays back BTC.
So I assume that if the user that borrowed your BTC sold it, that he would have received dollars, those dollars could be used to re-buy BTC and refund you.
But if the user did not sell your BTC (sell order still on the orderbook) then this users BTC might have been stolen, so he wont be able to pay you back your BTC
Its quite complex sorting out these sort of things.

Yes, but there are various ways to secure a server against compromise though physical access (full disk encryption, kernel compiled without module support) and having a private rack/room with 24/7 cameras and guards (This is pretty normal practice, most datacenters have extreme security levels).
There is no way to protect your VPS against the type of access, and you will never even know someone accessed your data in the first place.
Storing private keys of any significant value in the cloud is completely irresponsible. Do you know all the security routines of this firm? How do you know that hardware they might discard does not contain traces of your data?

Easy, in the blocks when the attack was executed 99.9% percent of the transactions involving multisigs were part of the attack.
That already narrows down your result set, and now you can filter that down by filtering by transactions signed by the same two keys used in most of those transactions (the bitfinex key and the bitgo key)
The insider job argument for not implementing this defence tactic is pretty weak, because to be effective bitgo would have had to implement it.

Because you will lose lawyer fees, and have no chance in court, because by selling your BFX-tokens you agreed to sell all your debt claims.
 
--By **transferring** a token to another person, all transferors thereby assign to the respective transferees **any claims** that the transferor has against the **Bitfinex Group** on account of the Losses.
When using bitfinex again you had to agree to the new terms to use the sell BFX tokens page, and by actually selling you are re-affirming your acceptance of these terms.
People who believe they can still sue after selling their BFX-tokens live in a fantasy world, its like someone selling their bitcoin and afterwards claiming they want their bitcoin back in court.
According to the Choice of Court Convention the jurisdiction picked in the Terms of Service is internationally recognize and binding.
The bitfinex terms of service state
-You unconditionally attorn to the jurisdiction of the courts of the **British Virgin Islands** and all courts competent to hear appeals therefrom. The doctrine of forum non conveniens shall not apply in the selection of forum under these Terms of Service.

The argument used by the OP is not rational at all.
He frames it as though a user who has x% loss on their margin position will be extra affected by the cut, while in fact, they are getting exactly what their margin position is worth at that point in time.

Fun fact: lol is actually a word in the dutch language meaning funny that was added to the dictionairy in the early 19th century. Since the Netherlands (Holland) was one of the first countries to be connected to the internet in september 1988. It is very likely that the real origins of the internet word lol are from dutch people using it. People made up the acronym Laugh Out Loud later.
It is similar to HODL, some people say it means "Hold On for Dear Life" but people who have been around long enough know that is not what the term means at all. People have invented that acronym later to try and make sense of it.

- 500 bitcoin = $500,000
- 800 bitcoin = $800,000
- 1,161,460 Ethereum = $9,000,000
So the statement "So Ethereum Foundation sold around half of their ETH reserves while increasing their Bitcoin position by 60%."
Can be re-worded to say:
"So Ethereum Foundation sold around half of their ETH reserves while increasing their Bitcoin position from 5% to 8% of total holdings"
- 90% exposure to Ethereum, and less than 10% exposure to Bitcoin.

Which proves it was not just wash trades. I opened a 1500 BTC short one day as a hedge for a transfer I was waiting for (to prevent too much exposure), and after the transfer was done I could close the short and als this cost no trading fees and maybe 0.1% slippage.
On a western market such a trade would cost a ton on fees and even more on slippage because the liquidity on all exchanges (besides okcoin and huobi in the past) is horribly bad.

You are saying that by giving the government control over its own currency issuance it becomes easier to manage the country and make the economy grow.
While that is partly true, it depends on wither you believe that the ends justify the means.
It is a trade-off of individual rights verses collective rights. 
Your proposed solution allows a government to tax their citizen up to a much higher amount than normally possible. By inflating the money supply the government can spend money out of thin air, essentially stealing purchasing power from everyone. This system works if you believe in socialist ideology, since it allows stealing from the rich and giving to the poor in a much more effective way.
The fatal flaw in this system is that rich people are generally more mobile, they can easily switch over their operations to a different country, with a different currency. This creates either the usage of legal loopholes using shell companies or actual brain-drain by the elite leaving.
When the elite leaves innovation stagnates and a country becomes uncompetitive. 
Venezuela has progressed far in this process and is now facing an economy that is totally dependant on oil revenue. Giving the low oil price the country is struggling.
Socialism works as a short-term strategy to increase equality, and seems to improve the economy (Since more people are now spending). But in the long term it erodes the fundamentals behind a countries economy and it will collapse. The government will try to stop this process by limiting freedom. But eventually the process will destroy the country. After that the painful process of rebuilding from scratch starts.
The elite of any country can grouped into two categories: 1: Rich families passing along wealth. 2: The smartest people of society.
Arguably society does not need 1, but any country will fail when they loss 2.

Inflation punishes passive money (Unused) more than it punishes active money (Invested money).
Therefore increasing inflation, increases both investment and spending.
1: In this situation Person-A, Person-B, Person-C and Person-D all had the opportunity to earn $1000, and combined they earned $4000:
- If Person-A earns $1000, and spends this on goods provided by Person-B then Person-B will earn $1000.
- If Person-B earns $1000, and spends this on goods provided by Person-C then Person-C will earn $1000.
- If Person-C earns $1000, and spends this on goods provided by Person-D then Person-D will earn $1000.
2: In this situation only Person-A made $1000, the others made $0:
- If Person-A earns $1000, and keeps it as cash.
- If Person-B earns $0, and spends this on goods provided by Person-C then Person-C will earn $0.
- If Person-C earns $0, and spends this on goods provided by Person-D then Person-D will earn $0.
**Because people have an expectation of inflation most people will not keep their money as cash, but they will instead put it in a bank (To get interest, which will help counter inflation). Creating the following situation:**
3: In this situation Person-A, Person-C, Person-D and Person-E all had the opportunity to earn $1000, and combined they earned $4000, (However Person-B has a $1000 debt):
- If Person-A earns $1000, and puts it in a bank, this bank loans this money to Person-B.
- If Person-B loans $1000, and spends this on goods provided by Person-C then Person-C will earn $1000.
- If Person-C earns $1000, and spends this on goods provided by Person-D then Person-D will earn $1000.
- If Person-D earns $1000, and spends this on goods provided by Person-E then Person-E will earn $1000.
Since Person-B,Person-C and Person-D still need to be able to eat and sleep, the government now need to provide them with money, but it can only do this by raising taxes. However in situation 1 the government could charge income-tax on all 4 people, in situation 2 the government can only charge income tax on 1 person. 
Since the government will probably not be able to sufficiently tax just person-A to pay for all others, it usually resorts to printing money to pay the others. Since printing money increases inflation, it will have the side-effect of punishing Person-A for not spending his money. If this punishment causes Person-A to start spending then the government will be faced with situation 2 which is better for the country.
Note: While I recognize that this principle is useful. It gives too much power to the government to control its citizen. By having a non-inflationary alternative (like cryptocurrency) it will force a government to not push this tactic too far or they will risk losing control since people will use a currency not controlled by the government. Most of the financial problems facing the world at this moment are caused by government trying to push this principle too far creating huge asset bubbles.

Actually if China becomes serious about banning bitcoin for real this time it will be a mayor issue.
Last time they did not want to ban bitcoin, they simply wanted to reduce the impact it has on China.
Since they are now realizing it is a problem again they can do this:
They can quickly modify the great firewall to block or greatly delay packages that look like bitcoin traffic (it supports advanced packet analysis).
This will create major chaos, because it will basically split the network in two, and it is unsure if the hashrate of Bitcoin-China will be higher than Bitcoin-rest of the world.
If Bitcoin-China has a higher hash rate then this creates a major problem for the Bitcoin-World network, since all the miners there know that all their efforts might be in vain. If the longer chain created by the Bitcoin-China miners somehow makes it out of the great firewall it will cause a major chain re-organisation. Because it will be the longer chain.
The chinese goverment could on purpose Block-unBlock-Block-unBlock.
That way the Bitcoin-world network will shift between being overly slow (+20min blocks) to being reorganized and cause double spending risks.
All this will create a major downward pressure on the price, and with it downward pressure on the in incentive to mine. 
Eventually the Chinese goverment could decide to deliver a deathblow by seizing all the bitcoin mining equipment and using it explicitly to attack bitcoin.
When this happens the rest of the world is faced with a dillema. the network will be cripled and the only two ways out of it will be either buying billions of dollars worth of mining equipment (to mine an asset with now uncertain future), or switch to a different type of proof of work.
It will be unclear though how well bitcoin will cope with the huge uncertainty caused by this event. Bitcoin has no effective leadership, so it is very well possible different parts of the network will want to take different solutions to this problem. For example chosing which proof of work will be a major challenge. Some people will argue it is best to switch to something tried and tested like the proof of work of litecoin, but then some people could argue China again has a huge share in that. Then it could be argued it needs to be a completely new proof of work. But the parameter choosen will be very political, since it might favor certain CPU/GPU/ASIC configurations over others

Actually it will allow capital flight.
One person might want transfer out 1 billion RMB, but transfering this using any method other than bitcoin will cause it to get flagged and stopped.
If this person buys bitcoin instead it will push up the RMB price of bitcoin compared to the USD price.
Now an arbitrage oppertunity is created, and thousands of people take the oppertunity to make a profit of this arbitrage oppertunity.
All these small time arbitragers contribute a small enough effort so that it is within the limits of the law.
An individual chinese person has a quota of the amount of money he can tranfer out of the country legally (I believe it is $50000 a year).
Many of these people dont use their quota under normal circumstances.
But bitcoin puts incentive pressure on this. And since china has 1.4 billion people, that means a theoretical outflow of almost 75 trillion $ a year.

That depends on the amount of fees from transactions.
If bitcoin use does not grow to a point were fees alone can pay for the electricity needed to protect the network then it might get to a point where users decide expanding the monetairy supply is needed to keep the network safe.

ICO's are a completely new way to get investors. However what benefit does it have over traditional investments?
The main ones from a person looking for investments are:
- There is no regulation
- The userbase in inexperienced with investing (Most made a quick buck with crypto and suddenly have huge amounts of money without actual business track record and/or experience)
- It is not even clear that investors have any actual legal rights
So in a sense ICOs are an easy vessel people can use to scam people out of money.
So I agree with what you are saying, but unfortunately it is not going to happen that way.
There may be a few ICO's that will generate money, for investors but most won't, they will be gambling vessels propped up to unrealistic values, until people start learning most of the ICO's are actually worthless.
Sure maybe a lot of people who start ICO's have genuine good ideas, but over times their intentions might get corrupted because they realize that this huge pot of money is actually theirs and the investor has no real legal rights. So many owners of ICO's will pay themselves generous wages while doing very little, or simply run of with the money, depending if they want to keep up appearances or not.

Well, it means 4 things:
1: The fact that every computer should be assumed hackable is more true than ever, so the risk assessment you made should be adjusted.
2: By knowing this weakness in Intel chips you have probably found one of its greatest weaknesses. It should have already been assumed it had a build-in backdoor, since security agencies demand such things. However it is unlikely that an Intel chip will contain two as advanced backdoor mechanisms, so following the tutorials to disable Intel ME, might actually make Intel chips safer than competitors as a result. 
3: It could trigger you to transfer more of your data into cold-storage (Not connected to the internet in any way).
4: It should be assumed that an exploit for this vulnerability will one day be discovered, and that will mean a digital apocalypse of never before seen scale. It will greatly influence how people view their privacy and safety, and you can consider how this risk might affect you personally.
Keep in mind that remotely exploitable hardware exploits are very rare, and this will be the first that could affect billions of people. There might not be a solution available that can be implemented by regular low-tech end-users, since upgrading hardware is a very different story than upgrading software.

Bitcoin is no longer a thing laymen never heard about. That is simply a fiction people like to tell eachother to back up claims of uncontrolled future growth.

I traveled to over a 100 countries so I have quite a bit of comparison material. 
I spend quite a few months traveling around india and one popular theme is blaming different factors for why india is not as successful as it could be. Some say the british stole all their wealth. Some say the government is too corrupt. Some say people don't pay enough taxes.
But personally after trying to do business with india multiple times and after knowing many indians got the idea that the main factor is lack of truth/integrity/honesty. Everywhere you go in india, whenever you ask for the meaning of anything or ask directions or ask about history, 3 people will give you 3 different stories.
If an indian person explains his job, or his education or his background he will tell you whatever he thinks you want to hear based on what he wants to get out of you.
Of-course not all indians are the same, and there are many many indians. But if I had to look at averages I would say lack of honesty is one of the main challenges when doing business with india. Every poor country faces this to a degree, but in India the problem is far worse.

I did not disagree that all systems are hackable. However you talk about it like it is not worth discussing this very important security vector, because "All systems are hackable".
It is true that there is no safe system, but by knowing all the known attack vectors, and by protecting yourself further by anticipating unknown attack vectors it is possible to make it too difficult or too expensive for your particular opponent to hack you.
The higher value target you are the more security measures you have to take. Simple exploits can be used to hack low-value targets, but high-value targets that have protected themselves against all known attack vectors can only be targeted using unknown (to the public) attack vectors. Since this kind of exploit is very valuable it can be that the risk of exposure of the high value exploit makes it not worth it.
So while secure in theory might not be obtainable, secure in practice can be obtainable. But to achieve that you have to keep adapting yourself.
Your last sentence proves exactly why this particular security weakness is very interesting, since under normal circumstances you are right that a firewall could help. But because Intel ME listens directly on the Ethernet port and runs independent of the main processor and hence independent of the Operating System, a software firewall will offer no protection. Meaning there is no way to shield yourself in practice, unless you are aware of a hardware device firewall that does not contain a similar backdoor. Some people say that Intel ME is disabled by default and hence no treat, but that is only an assumption, and likely wrong. Corrupting the firmware of the Intel ME will mean your computer will shutdown automatically after 30-min. There is probably a hidden remove way to activate it remotely.

So you have counter proof?
The whole "show me proof" argument is flawed in a lot of situations. People will have to accept that "proof" is always something that makes something "likely". How "likely" something becomes, and what is considered acceptable depends on the context. In micro situations very convincing proof is possible, for example in Chemistry or Biology. However in many other domains providing very good proof is impossible, because things can only be in-directly observed (Psychology and Economics).
In markets there are very little things that can be directly observed. So smart people will instead rely on the proof that is the most convincing.
If you are stuborn person that only accepts "Absolute truth", whatever that concept might mean. Then sorry but I have to tell you this: Sorry but this reality does not work that way, and you will be a very ineffective person since your screening of information will not allow you to accumulate knowledge of any kind.
In reality very few people are so stubborn all of the time, most people use it only when there existing beliefs are being challenged making it a very powerful enforcer of the Confirmation Bias.

About the effect of interest rates hikes and its effect on the value of bitcoin, mentioned in the article, I have a different opinion in the cause and effect relationship in this matter:
When the fed increases the monetairy base (print money) it will lead to inflation (aka prices increases) (because money becomes less scarce, and thus loses value).
However this inflation only happens when this new money is actually being spend, if it just sits idle it wont affect the market.
How fast money is being spend is called the velocity of money.
The velocity of money is at historical lows and the amount of money in circulation at historical highs.
Therefore a lot of inflation is likely to happen at some point in the future.
The fed raises the interest rates in anticipation of this inflation to try and keep it under control.
So while a price rise of many products (including bitcoin) is likely (inflation). Your argument that it is caused by the interest rate increase is not true. The interest rate increase is merely a signal that the fed expect the velocity of money and as a consequence inflation to increase.
If my argument makes no sense: sorry I am very tired at the moment.

The assumption that there is no exploit in the wild is an naive assumption.
Anyone with enough skill to use such an exploit also has the brains to realise how valuable it is.
If you have a multi-billion dollar worth secret exploit, of course you are not going to report on it. If you tried you would probably end up missing.

Actually hardware wallets existed from day 1, at least for those who have the technical skills.
What makes a hardware wallet safe is that the private key gets generated on a separate device that lacks networking capabilities (a separate piece of hardware).
So in effect a hardware wallet is just a processor and some memory and storage.
It is trivally easy to design your own hardware wallet, and when I designed my own it only took a few hours.
Making an easy to use and idiot proof hardware wallet and mass producing it and marketing it to make the costs reasonable is a completely different story.

I guess if they give you 3% APR then that is not too bad.
But to be able to make such attractive rates possible they have to establish a complicated credit rating system first, to separate low risk individuals from high risk individuals when it comes to lending. 
Exchanging such information on a massive scale would not be allowed due to privacy legislation in the European union.
I guess it is nice for some people they can get cheap liquidity, but at the cost of those weaker in society being stuck with a poor credit rating and being charged massive amounts for the same service.

As a Dutch native I would like to add a couple of points to make the contents of this article more easy to place into context for foreigners.
First of all yes, cash payments are getting more rare and have been getting more rare for the past decade. 
- The main argument was that carrying less cash discourages robbers. 
The card system in the Netherlands is different than the visa/mastercard systems. It is more like an electronic version of cash. The cards are very secure (no magnetic strip), pin payments only. Generally no online payments with cards unless you add a service provider like Ideal. No chargebacks possible, no merchant fees. No overdrafts or debt allowed (with small exceptions)
From the consumers point of view it is a very attractive system, because you never get charged extra for using it. And you will never have to deal with coins and wallets.
Obviously crypto-currencies still have some advantages over this system: 1 Free from central bank control, 2 free from confication by the goverment. 
But these are not advantages most regular people care about since: 1: basically means more value fluctuations and most people simply want to spend without having to think or worry about this and 2: this is only partly true, because they have other means to force you to pay (confiscate passport, late payment fines, jail time)
I personally think 1 is worth fighting for, but I guess mainstream people will only realize that when the central backs cause major problems that can be felt by ordinary people.

I doubt DB will be allowed to go bankrupt, letting the lehman brothers collapse is widely viewed as the cause of the 2008 financial crisis by bankers.
Of course reckless lending and creating money out of thin air is the root cause behind all the problems in the financial system.
But like we do in healthcare most of the time, and like we currently do with our financial system is not treating the root cause but treating the symptoms instead.
The central banks can prevent DB from collapsing if they want to because they can create money out of thin air as much as they like. They can give DB billions of euros of loans at negative interest rates to cover any liability they might have.
Of course such "solutions" create even larger problems long term. But who knows how long they will be able to do it.
I personally expect a prolonged time of stagnation and increasing burdens for the younger generations, and no immidiate crash. But that is difficult to tell to a bitcoin community that wants economic doomsday for their own financial benefit.
@_date: 2016-09-15 18:11:28
Looking at official statistics is misleading, I happen to know a lot of high profile bankers in the netherlands and they explain that statistic the following way:
That statistic is caused by how the banks represent the savings versus debt, the netherlands has both the highest savings rate and one of the highest debt rate in the world. That is because the morgage debt is represented in both numbers unlike in most countries.
It has to do with tax deductions on morgage debt, therefor banks offer products that allow you to keep your morgage debt artificially high while still paying back the bank, but receiving maximum tax benefit.

One question I have is: Why are you not a Panamanian resident, it is probably the easiest country in the whole world to get residency (I have it), there are about 52 different ways to become a resident. And given the fact that you are able to stay in the country for 6 months that tells me that you are from a country that has a good relationship with panama. Meaning you can most likely apply for a "friendly countries visa". Basically you start a company that doesnt really do anything, and they grand you a life long residency visa.
And even if your not a resident opening a bank account is not very hard. I know someone ( a non-resident ) who only had a college degree to proof he could make money and after 2 months they opened a bank account for him (not the usual bank reference requirement).
Anyway, bitcoin requires no KYC at all so good on you, but I am just surprised you chose to operate like that in Panama.

In the world outside of the United States, most people like to only spend money they actually have.

I am from the Netherlands and literally know nobody who buys a car on a loan, but then again they might simply not tell me about it, but it is definitely not something considered normal.

Your right to and extent. What banks and other big financial institutions like about blockchains is that using a distribute ledger it allows them to make a tamper proof "record keeping system". The fact that it becomes tamper proof is important because that will allow international legislation to be enacted that will greatly speed up cross border transactions.
Sure if there is central authority is might not be 100 percent tamper proof, but central authority can never act outside of its mandate because doing so would be completely transparent.
The reason current day international financial transactions are so slow is because it contains inefficiencies that most people cannot even understand why they exist. The underlying reason is mainly trust. But more trust in a legal sense. A lot of times different jurisdictions are not allowed to take certain facts as facts until all parties independently verify it.
There need to be an internationally agreed treaty or standard to solve this.
Take for example another inefficiency that was solved in the past using the apostille convention:
The one of document authentacy. 
In the past for very important legal matters a document would have to be certified 2x: once by the sending jurisdictions courts and once by the receiving jurisdictions courts (verifying the stamp of the first).
It makes sense that certification should only be needed once. but because of the way legal systems work, they are only allowed to accept as fact things decided by the competent authorities inside that jurisdiction.
Unless there is a international treaty overriding such requirements.
Big financial institutions are interested in blockchain because it might allow them to create an international standard on ownership transactions of digital data representing value.

Actually your claim that using a mixing service is better than using an exchange for mixing purposes is false.

 this source claims the blockchain is supposed to be over 200GB, yet I have a fully synced node with on 15GB of data in use.

Yes, but it is an extremely expensive and unlikely attack, it means that someone who performs a sustained 51% can temporarily fool newly synced nodes into a false state.
But fast sync doesnt have to be used to sync to the state of the blockchain right now, it can be used to sync to the blockchain of last week, meaning someone would have to 51% attack the whole network for a week (while creating a seperate chain containing invalid state changes). and still be only able to fool freshly synced nodes.
If someone were to pull off such an enormously expensive attack (more than $50 million at today hash rate) it would surely be know by the community and migratory action would be undertaken.
