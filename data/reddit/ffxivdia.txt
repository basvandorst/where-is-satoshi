How do they calculate the rate tho?

Slight hope, maybe try after Jan 31? I talked to a Wells Fargo investment banker and he said they were having a meeting on that day to be more educated about crypto. I asked him what is Wells Fargo’s stand on crypto right now, and he said they are not for or against it, but the volatile nature of the market makes it so they are not going to help their customers invest in crypto. 
Of course, their investment side is probably different from their business account side...

Like, atms? What do you mean all over japan?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:59:42
I salute u sir, I myself am too chicken to invest more money right now. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 01:26:04
Yeah but can u imagine if u give these out to the kids, in 10 years we might get another btc bull run. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 01:29:52
Exactly. That’s what I will pass out this year, if I can find it.

How old is your grandma?
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:51:20
Wow that's amazing reading what used to be a $600 mistake. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:22:54
Haha first thing I thought of after seeing this. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:14:27
If you have a good relationship with your parents, tell them the truth. 
I recently told my mom about it, I'm also nearly twice your age, but she was very confused but took me a while to explain how it works but it worked out at the end. She even bought some crypto at the dip today!
So op, how did it go?
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:14:54
Funny you should ask, my mom was just saying how she would put everything into crypto if she won the lottery. For me, I'd only put half lol
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:22:44
There was an armistice but no treaty.  Hmm yeah I dunno if that counts as the end of the war or just a pause. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:14:49
Recently when the news mentions drugs and bitcoin, my mother said, oh so that's why it cost so much! lol it doesn't phase her though, I introduced it to her as an alternative investment platform. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:26:31
There should be a 5K run for bitcoin awareness once it happens :D
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:16:31
Oh yeah, but if it's encrypted or erased, maybe it'll take a while to recover it.... if the story is even real. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:25:51
Oh shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:05:57
Does this means the any bitcoin (BTC) I have on exchanges can now transfer out way cheaper to my own wallet now; and don't have to pay $5+ in transaction fee for micro transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:05:37
Might need to find a copy of that now!
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:29:01
Technically isn't the US still at war with North Korea?

Only half of the world's population even have access to the internet, not sure how many percent of that are adults. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:54:42
I should get some bitcoin for my niece for her birthday, hope it might worth something for her college fund. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:24:41
Go mom! I'm surprised she even noticed to look and know what that is!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:00:26
Only adds to the value of btc with less supply. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:54:25
Think the one I saw at a store locally was about $5k, Janome skyline s9 I think it was. I ended up buying a laser cutter instead lol. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:34:03
Nice machine! I wish the one I have access to would automatically trim the threads!
Btw you guys in the US, check your local library or makerspace, usually there are access to use an embroidery machine fairly cheaply or free. A basic embroidery machine that does 4x4” max size cost $500-700+
The tough part is the “digitizing” of graphics, usually the software cost a bit of money. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:29:50
Just do a search for “makerspace + your location”, then go visit! They usually have free tours. The one I go to has laser cutters, 3D printers, wood and metal shop, crafting and sewing, robotics, Arduino, and even a crypto study group and classes on bitcoin mining!
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:56:22
What about HER money? Don't suggest someone to do something you wouldn't do yourself. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:51:51
I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter if it has bite marks or chunks of it taken out. This is only in theory since I'm too poor to ever hold a bar of gold in my life. 
In jewelry business tho, precious stones and metals are sold by weight, there were a few shows I've been to that I saw this in action. (Not for gold bar, but for stones and they charged for fiat). 
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:18:51
Soooo that's insider trading right?
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:57:48
I thought it would be zero. You didn't have to pay for it after all. When you sell your bitcoin then it would be different cuz you paid for that. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:17:09
That means you were never willing to lose that 300 in the first place. 
Do you own any 401k or ira? It helps prepare you to not worry too much. Once you have seen the top potential and have it all go below how much you have put in, you just need to realize that you will only lose money if you sell. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:41:40
You measure out the weight of the gold and take it to a scrap metal or jeweler place to sell it for fiat. Then go to buy it with cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:59:04
Thought it was like 5 days til all trading stop and they must withdraw by the end of October?
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:12:55
If you never invest more than what you are willing to lose, then there is no problem with hodling. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:35:44
They had that site for months tho. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:23:53
Why the fuck would they even keep bitcoin, wouldn't they trade it for monero?
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:22:35
I went to bed thinking I should sell and buy more when it drops... then when I woke up it dropped a bit. No more hesitation. Sold my tiny bit of bitcoin, come on dip! I want to get more!
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:29:37
How do you get it if you already have btc? Sorry I'm a noob
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:07:35
Saw that article this morning... it's a click bait really. There's nothing backing up that guys claims. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:24:08
I thought BCC wouldn't exist until after aug 1?
So does that mean if my bitcoin were on an exchange like coinbase I wouldn't have a copy of bcc now?
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:47:07
Wait so it's separate from the regular Electrum wallet? I just tried moving some bitcoin to a new electrum wallet, though I wasn't too sure what I was suppose to do after that during the wait for aug 1.
Sorry I'm such a newbie &gt;.&lt;

Persistence of Vision type of gadget on a fidget spinner? I'd actually like one lol. If there's a small enough micro controller and a micro SD card, powered by a coin battery, that should work ....
Edit: google POV fidget Spinner. It does exist!
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:19:00
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:09:52
Should have bought in at 2460s!
