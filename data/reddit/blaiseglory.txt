I think you are being too hard on him. I think his message is that if you buy bitcoin you’ll be able to afford to sit on a wall overlooking the ocean, and I’m all for that.

I think you may have misunderstood the concept of immutability of the blockchain.

You’re right, most of my money is in ETH

Sorry, that is a BS argument. Those systems do hundreds of millions of transactions per day, bitcoin doesn’t come close. If you don’t think Bitcoin’s energy consumption (and every other PoW system)  is a problem, you are seriously delusional.

Well maybe the structured recipe just says ‘add fuck all fruit’ because that’s what I got. The girl behind the counter was quite embarrassed by it and told me clearly that my original drink was made according to the recipe.
Next time you get a smoothie there have a close look at what goes into it, I think you’ll be surprised at how little fresh fruit it actually contains.

It was the Fremantle store, and yes it could have been a directive from that store’s management. Either way I was not impressed.

But then you have to buy their shitty product. I bought a Berry Blast from one of their stores and was amazed to see the girl making it put in one strawberry and a couple of blueberries, some ice cream and a whole lot of apple juice. When I complained she apologised and made one that had a little bit more fruit, but she said that they were told to only put small amounts of actual fruit in the smoothies. 
The place is a rip off basically, most of what it really just sells is cheap apple juice.

I’m not. 
Please share your methodology, otherwise your predictions are of no value to anyone

Wow, predictions from a Python program. I’m impressed!
