Can anyone explain why it won't crash?  I foresee a security breach within, oh 12 months. This could be a major exchange, or with the underlying blockchain tech itself.  Set a remind me for this post, and kiss my feet when you live in poverty you scum.

Cool man.  Doesn't relate whatsoever to the legal status of BTC in Vietnam.  More so a disclaimer on the general mechanics of any investment advice. Thanks for proving my statement 
Have a new year xoxoxo love you
