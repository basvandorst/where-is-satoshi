Privacy is not a crime. Tax Evasion, Money Laundering and/or Terrorist Financing are. 
All I am saying here is that helping others achieve this anonymity without knowing their intent is negligent at best. This mentality is exactly what gets crypto a bad reputation. 
Again. If you want anonymity in your transactions go buy Monaro. If you have no reason to hide your sources of income stop trying to create this false sense of obscurity within BTC and other altcoins - That is not their core value proposition.

Dude. I’m going to clue you in on something. Anyone trying to “anonymize” their BTC transactions did not acquire their BTC from any legal business. 
You are literally laundering money for people, and I would strongly suggest you take that natural skill set and apply it to words a path that will yield even higher returns (and keep you out of federal prison). If you graduate just about any 4 year college with experience coding in blockchain, or actually any programming language for that matter, you will be making $100k annually within 3-5 years post grad. 
You clearly have the Hussle. Figure out how to monetize it. 
Also. If people are looking for anonymous transactions on a blockchain. Take their $200 and tell them to use Manero. Literally solves the problem.

I applaud educating people on how to purchase crypto, I really do. 
However, if you are purchasing on behalf of another party, and the that person sends the funds to any group or individual linked to any illegal activities - you will be implicated in it for any host of felonies (money laundering, terrorist financing, etc.) 
Any time you’re “helping people transact without the government knowing” you need to ask yourself why they are doing that. I saw your response on helping your dad stay anonymous. That’s fine. But people off craigslist? Sketchy at best.

Switch “Anyone” to “Many People”. You are correct.

Hey - who knows. Your reddit profile is only 12 hours old, so for all I know this is just a very well played phishing exercise. 
Just be cautious.
