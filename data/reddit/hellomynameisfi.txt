Legal, yet bad! Kinda BTC/Bcash analogy innit? Karma ;)
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:58:18


So they are going to pay higher fees then they should (since they are the ones that pay them). So if they are hostile towards BTC that doesn;t matter to me. I buy on GDAX with a limit (mostly no fee) and transfer to cold-wallet (no fee from GDAX), It is profitable from my point of view, to them not so much. Their choice.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:46:46


I still can't have set my own fee? Why? Wouldn't the calculator be more useful when it would tell you an approximate time of tx confirmation for a chosen value? Now that would be useful.
Where did you get this 510 sat/B value from? Are you using next block fee or 0-delay fee? Why would you want to choose any of those values? 0-delay makes no sense for most transactions. Look at mempool. If you set your tx to 510 you will be in a minority (by far upwards - meaning overpaying) of what the market pays (but for a luxury of confirming the tx within 1 minute - which for most transactions makes no economic sense) which is a 100-140 sat/B value.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:01:09
Yes... this!
Heh... you got fucked by Coinbase, sorry bro, they set 450-600sat/B fees :D
Sorry for thinking you are a trololo... now i feel kinda bad ... you just got fucked buy the attacker :/
Next time you can withdraw without fees through GDAX. Log into GDAX (same credentials as Coinbase), transfer your funds there. Withdraw from there (check if they still say there are no fees). Profit :)
... and again... sorry for thinking you a troll

Bitcoin is a long term thing. As a deflationarry asset it is best to hold it. Exchanging a deflationary asset (BTC) for an inflationary asset (FIAT) makes no sense in the long run.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:32:53


But still, what is so super about Bitcoin to you? Cause if you want cheap transactions, high speeds and high acceptance you might be better of with FIAT. 


The miners would love that;) This is a community and you have to think about both sides. Those fees don't go to banks, but to bitcoiners. Paying few cents, with those volumes? No the fees don't have to be cents or fraction of cents. Nobody ever said that Bitcoin transactions are supposed to be cheap. You want to pay cents on both transactions of 1USD and of 100000 USD? So would I mate. What do you propose? How we do dat?


It has more properties of gold (right now) then a currency. So why should my 4x4 Jeep compete in Nascar?
100sat/B is about 3,40 USD not 5,00 USD. I use values less then that and get money sooner then 5 days... believe me that :D But yes, there is no guarantee that mempool won't change, so I'm gonna get my money few days later. I have sent a lot of FIAT around the world. You have no idea how slow can it be, how your transfer can bounce back (the destination was in Asia, not some African war torn country) because _the bank wants to protect me_, how you can pay penalty-fees on that bounced transfer, how that fucks up your week. Here... I set a fee of 30 USD (If I need to) and have a confirmation within an hour or two. 30 USD would be less then that penalty.


There are still 1 sat/B transactions that are being cleared (not much of them, but still), you know that, don't you?
You don't know which chart is showing what? Maybe I can help and explain. The last chart i showed you was average confirmation times, meaning how fast you will see your assets in new wallet and you can then spend them. Currently it's 51 minutes or so. That is more then enough for me.
The model is not 100 USD per gallon of gas. You are not forced to pay that much here. The model is: _pay as much as you want for the gallon, but have in mind that the less you pay the later you will receive your fuel_.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:41:53
I... don't remember who wrote it... but... shouldn't zero sat/B be ok as long as mempool clears?

@_date: 2018-01-09 12:13:46
I'd say that a theoretical maximum (end-game) price of BTC would be (all BTC and Gold mined (est. that there are 300000 tonnes in total of mined and minable gold):
1 oz. Gold = 0,001 - 0,002 BTC = ~260000 USD (in FIAT _today_)
You can only compare a store of value to a store of value. FIAT currencies are not stores of values, but simply an IOU's. They cannot store value as they are inflationary in nature. You can only express FIAT value in historical or current values.

Yes. He mentions gold as a non-investment. Not thinking that investment doesn't always mean profits it may just prevent a loss of value.
I only wasted time reading this _blog post_. Guy has no idea what he is talking about.
Everything has value _only_ because of consensus. For example apples have no intrinsic dollar value. This means that you can buy the same article in two different stores for a different price. This means the price can change in the future. You agree which price you are willing to pay. You make a transaction. You cannot invest in apples directly as they are a product or create a product. You can invest in an apple option but you will have no guarantee this debt will be payd to you. You can hold to those apples but they will either be eaten or rot. You may sell those apples fir FIAT but that will lose value over time. You can buy a scarse asset and store this value much longer. So gold is a viable investement strategy.
He might be a computer scientist he has bo clue about economics and why things have value.
This _blog post_ is so full of economic fallacies that it would take a loooong time to comment on every singe one of them...
. a lot of words not backed by knowledge.

Are you really asking me this question? Think about it a bit. We used it as a currency. We stopped because there were better alternatives (in terms of transaction speed as well). Most people don't even trade real gold instead they trade gold-certificates (an I have no idea what those are, but there is much more of them then gold on this planet). But gold remained a store of value. Gold (except for extreme scenarion) will not become currency again. But Bitcoin can go both ways. It will always be a store of value, but if there are technical possibilities it might become a currency (and that may happen in few months)... then there might be a better currency, but it will remain a store of value.

No, LN has mechanisms built in to discourage centralization.
LN is not controlled by a company as they have opened it and agreed on standards for interchangeability with other entities wanting to join (they will never be the only player).
Because Bitcoin is highly decentralized and fully countable. Faster and cheaper does not mean more secure and decentralized. Nobody controls Bitcoin except the community as a whole.

Well it's quite easy. 
Coinbase forces high fees on the network (even around 600 sat/B). Then charges the customers if they don't withdraw their funds through GDAX. Turns out they are spamming the BTC network. Why? We can only suspect ;)

@_date: 2018-01-10 12:14:09
But I can always choose to send a small fee transfer that is going to go through after, let's say, 10 days... a month. That is my decision to pay 50 sat/B instead of 500 sat/B. You can choose to lower your fee 100 fold. Want things to go fast - pay. Don't need hyper speeds - pay less.
How is all of that a bad thing?
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:11:27
Look at it this way. The network slowed down for the same fee you payed somewhere in the past (a lot of new users). But you may choose to speed it up (pay higher fee). The network will speed up... and now i get to buy cheap :D
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:21:17
I am not saying that there was no fee for the transaction. I am simply saying that there are ways to minimize the costs. They chose to pay it, fine. Why should I care? I made a decision to use their service because of that market advantage. 
It would never occur to me to send a transaction with a fee of 535 sat/B today.

First go to "Accounts" and select a wallet you sent your funds from (BTC for eg.). There is gonna be some info about the transfer like "Sent Bitcoin" on the right (or something like "Sent Shitcoin" depending which wallet you have chosen previously. Click on it. Box opens. Lower right corner of the box says if the transaction went on-chain ("COMPLETED"). Pending means you won;t see it on the chain yet.
Check if the destination address is correct.
If it is completed then check your destination wallet on blockchain.info (or wherever you like). Should be there.
If it is not and it is completed and the address is correct: wait 24-72 hrs and file a ticket with the support.

I payed zero fees. I transferred X amount and received same X amount. Hence - no fee payed by _me_. I am not saying that there were no fees involved. I am just saying that there are simple ways to minimize them (thge part that you pay).
4 days is not acceptable? Have you tried SWIFT? How well does it work on weekends? 4 day transaction on BTC is equal to ~2,8 days SWIFT transaction really (excluding weekends). Are 4 week (Mo.-So. not Mo.-Fr.) days not acceptable for you for an international money transfer? I had transfers that took 2 weeks with FIAT currencies. 4 days for a low fee... even 10 days sometimes sound good. Try sending 20000 USD to a _legit_ company in Nigeria and see how fast will it arrive (if it won't bounce at some point).

@_date: 2018-01-11 10:33:35
Yes... but even if I pay my fees I don't set them to 500 sat/B :D
Domestic SWIFT usualy takes about 16 hours (different banking entities)... that is domestic.  People are enraged that they have to wait 16 hours for BTC transfer to complete. 
You pay with a credit card and the seller gets money instantly? Wait few months for LN... and you are golden.
The situation where somebody chooses to pay for me is quite nice indeed. Why should that worry me? They set their fee... i set mine.
So... do you think that 75 sat/B is high? Do a test. send some BTC with that fee through SegWit and see how long it takes.

In other words. You have to wait bit longer :)

Ok so everything can be a currency, but not everything is. Shells were once currency. They don't even store value now. It might have been a currency then but not because of quick transactions and low fees. Fast and cheap transactions do not determine if something is a good currency or not. You can have fast and cheap transaction with hiperinflation at the same time.
People are used to getting someething for free nowadays. But there is no such thing as for free. People think they use facebook and google for free, and yet those services cannot be free as that would be economically unsustainable. You are paying for those services weather you like it or not. It is better to know the price of the services you use. You are paying either directly or indirectly (value of the data provided is not being payed to you).
There is also nothing for free in Bitcoin. Let' look at the reacent fork. You want everybody to be able to run the node, don't you?... or just so the only entities that will be able to do so are big datacenters? Your block sizes cannot be 1GB big because not everybody will be able to catch up with downloading the chain, Even with just a bit bigger blocks you have to think about storage space that will have to grow slower then the median storage capacity in use by consumers. Even small changes push Bitcoin in some way. You want it centralized or not?
There are no easy way outs in Bitcoin. 
If all you want are quick and cheap transctions... the sea shells!
Bitcoin is better as digital gold then currency.
Blindly looking at the white paper is also kind of dumb. This is not a religion. You havevto upgrade for the benefit of all instead of only few.

Fee too low? Your transaction bounces. Submit it with the same fee if you have time or up the fee if you want it to be processed quicker. But a usable fee at this point is even below 100 sat/B.
... and yes I compare it to FIAT as both FIAT and BTC have their pros and cons. I am simply saying that the cons are not so bad.

You can try to activate an account at gdax.com. BTC on-chain transfers are free (or use any other exchange, but there might be fees when withdrawing). You can ask somebody that already has a GDAX if you can wire them £ and they can transfer BTC to your account if necessary.
You can try to day trade, but since you want to invest £100 in it I'd say you are a beginner and will. Day trading is risky.
My strategy for you would be: buy £100 of BTC now + £25 of BTC every month (do not look at the price for first 3 months) + as soon as being bot transfer to hardware SegWit wallet (that you didn't buy on Ebay).
Small amount means low financial risk vs your budget.
Cold storing will curb your emotions (you will have to pay a fee to return to the exchange).
Except to learn a lot and to gain just a bit of £.

Don't worry, GDAX payed over 4,3EUR for a transfer of 17EUR (equivalent in BTC). I payed about 0,0425EUR of fees. They are at a minimum 4,25EUR per every transaction I make. Beats me what is their business model :/

Guy doesn't really understand what an asset is, what is a store of value and what is currency.


Ok... soooo... gold? Does not really create products does it (and even if it does it has a deflationary effect as some part of that gold will be lost). Currency that creates products wouldn't be good as it would be consumed as product itself and would have to be replaced by something that is more permanent in storing value (Zimbabwean Dollar also stored value at some point, but it was more useful as wallpaper or toilet paper)... and if gold is not an investment then all those people through hundreds of years were wrong and this guy is right.
Bitcoin is the first secure _countable_ asset that exists. It is both secured by software (encryption) as well as physical by having no physical representation and may be stored in your mind (seed words). Better form of gold in my opinion.
Oh and substitute "Bitcoin" with "FIAT currencies" and this _blog post_ makes just as much sense.

You wrote: 


That just got me wondering. I am simply asking what is the new paradigm (your words used) of Bitcoin... what is it to you? Why did you invest in it (or didn't)? I just want to know your opinion on the subject.
Again... average fee is what people _are willing_ to pay for it. I am willing to wait a day or two for my transfer to complete. I would never pay 30,00 USD fee :D 100 sat/B is really fine by me (right now it will be few hour confirmation). Typical BTC transaction is about 250 bytes in size. That gives around 3,40 USD fee. 3,4 USD for a transfer of (for example) 13000 USD (equivalent) is a high price? ... or are you trying to "buy coffee" with your BTC on the spot? It makes as much sense as paying with Kruggerands for your coffee. Even though they hold value they are not meant for this task.
So what would you say is the lowest possible fee right now to get your transfer completed within 5 days? ... and how exactly fee range is a problem? If somebody is willing to pay high fees, I say, let them do it. Where is the problem?
Since we are throwing links at each other: 
The highest it was (historically) is 3564 minutes (~2,475 days). Compared to international wire transfer? It's a great result! Against VISA - not so much. As I said - you want to compete with VISA/Mastercard/PayPal/etc. then wait for LN too roll out and then you might pay for your coffee on 2nd layer.

Why people want to pay high fees is beyond me. They want to have their money in a new account in an instant at the same time have something that solves the double-spend problem.
You cannot have a cookie and eat a cookie.
Looking at the mempool right now.
If I needed a very fast transaction I would choose to pay somewhere around 225 sat/B and expect the money to be there within the next 48 hours. For slower transactions I would choose something between 50-80 sat/B depending how fast would I like to wait. I would have to wait probably around 5-10 days depending how everything plays out.
You can decide how fast the transfer should go and how much are you willing to pay for that. It is totally up to you. Mempool info is public.
Too me the problem for most people is more like: "I've set a high fee to have my money transferred in seconds and the fee was high". People just seem to be scared of "where iz the moneyz when between accounts" and set high fees (IMO).
Don't want to pay fees at all? Transfer from GDAX to on-chain - done!

@_date: 2018-01-11 20:49:13
Lose words like that. More info about how fees _actually work_. Adding a field to set desired sat/B then calculating expected time of completion for set sat/B. Separate calculations for non-SegWit and SegWit (also LN in near future). Calculation formulas should be open to verify.

Are you joking? Even right now the two layers that we have can be scaled to accommodate all monetary transactions in the world. The problem lies not in the current technology but the size of the networks (hence, it can be scaled) 


Tech goes forward you know. This sentence is like saying at the beginning of the '90 that there is no way you can stream a full feature movie in high quality over internet. VHS is superior and cannot be beaten ???!?!?


Compared to what? All the mainframes that banks use? All the workstations of bank employees? I work for a medium international company (\~5000FTE), just my location alone (which is one of the smallest - \~200FTE) uses almost 100MWh annually (and we are in a service business, not like we are running furnaces or anything). So the company I work for consumes *at least* 2,5GWh of power annually. Bitcoin currently consumes around 75TWh, might seem like a lot but that really is a drop in the ocean of all power consumption (I'd bet that it is even less then all the banks in the world alone, though I might be very wrong here). Additionally most Bitcoin mining uses renewable or excess produced electricity, so its actual impact on the grid is none to minimal (as we did not experience ANY energy price rise due to Bitcoin mining). Additionally there is nothing free in the world. You can choose PoS instead of PoW to limit the amount of energy use by sacrificing the decentralization.


I think you just went full retard here or you are just extremely ignorant in the field of economics. The sheer fact that somebody chooses to do it gives it economic value. So this can in no way be "useless" computation as those performing it would generate a loss (again, nothing in this world is free) and would be squeezed out of the market by more "useful" computation. /smh

@_date: 2019-07-23 05:40:31
Really? What are you, like fuckin' 5? OK, I'm gonna make this short:
1. In case of local war your BTC is safe. It does have to be some kind apocaliptic event for the whole network to go down. Right now you can send BTC throu a satelite link or even simple radio waves for that matter. E.g. People in venezuela value it a lot, even if there are blackouts and their local networks are down tgey still manage to get access. Temporary lack of access does not mean it is worthless.
2. I love Lambos, but wouldn't even cross my mind to buy one.
3. 3rd world countries do have access to it (look up Venezuela, Kenya, etc.)
4. I am not a citizen of the US, and I do not even live near by �� You Russian?
5. "Putin bought" meaning Central Bank of Russia
6. A simple act of buying gold did not have any impact on inflation as those are totally separate thinh when the currency is unbacked by it.
7. Gold is not the oldest form of money (please read a bit about the history of money).
8. Banks buy gold to hedge against the inflation they and other central banks create as they have foraign assets on the books of which the supply is/will be inflated (e.g. USD).
9. By central banks agenda I mean they wish to uphold the current system they can control. If you don't like the word "agenda" substitute it with "strategy".
10. The part about applying my logic - does't even make any sense. Please read again what I wrote.
11. Bitcoin will be used for what the market decides it is best used for.
Look mate, you seem to have little to none basic economic knowledge (not even mentioning of your lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works).
Let's end it like this: If you like gold, fine. Invest in it. Physical gold has it's place as an investment. I think we both agree on that. Just stop writting rubbish, as what you write is so full of fallacies it really hurts my brain. Put some effort in it and at least read some basic economy books (I recommend Friedmann or Sowell... they are fun to read).

2.  You cannot fully solve a problem without ever experiencing it. There are known compression technologies that may be used to compress blocks at storage.
3. Bandwidth problem is and will be nonexistent TBH.

I think you wanted to refer to a NPC and not a SJW meme ��


This just does not make and difference. Puerto Rico (natural disaster), Venezuela (failing infrastructure), Haiti (natural disaster and failing infrastructure). People will find ways to send a tx through by any means if necessary, even if by radio/post/whatever. Additionally if all your assets are in Bitcoin that is some poor diversification.


I truly tried to refer to all your arguments. If you have no means of accessing the network that is somewhat true. Everything has it's up- and downsides. You can then trade your gold in barter (as the other side of the transaction will statistically have no access to \~90% of their funds). I (personally) would use silver coins in that case to loose less value in barter. Bitcoin would be a store of high value that I do not have to access in the first few days of the disaster event.




I am sorry but I don't know what this part is referring to  ☹️






So... you want to tell me that Vladimir Putin is the Central Bank or he bought that gold and put it "in his pocket"?... or what are you trying to say?






Yes I did. But I don't think you know what inflation is. It is an inflation of the monetary supply and has nothing to do with buying or not buyong gold by the central bank or president Putin, or Jesus himself.






Oh sorry, my mistake. But by saying that "Gold is the oldest form of trade commodity" you are even more wrong, then before  ��


I admire your confidence ��


No, far from it. I don't believe in such conspiracies. Each central bank has their own goals in regards of the economy and it's (bank's) existence. At this point buying (openly) a decentralized asset that they cannot control would not be in their best interest






No, It means that this is the easiest way for us to give an abstract a numerical value. The fact that we currently do it in Fiat is a mere coincidence and is not necessary to giving anything value. If that was the case then it would have been impossible to assign value in times when there was no Fiat yet.


I would love to have copy pasted all that... would have saved me so much time  ��  If you think I copy pasted anything here (except clearly marker quote about Bitcoin's durability), then google it and see if it comes up.






This the answer to your question. The market will decide the best/optimal way of use. It is not up to you, me or Satoshi to decide. This is true for Bitcoin, gold, silver, cameras, steel, everything (in an free market economy).


You are either truly stupid or trolling (and I do not mean it in an offensive way).


This was my way of thanking you for this discussion. You clearly have a position that you will hold no matter what. But at the same time you clearly have no idea how economies work and what economics is all about. You try to be cocky, but it does not work that way if you have little to no knowledge of the subject.

@_date: 2019-07-22 17:32:02
Sure, I will gladly waste some of my time to teach you about economics (though I think you should have done it yourself before you wrote all that). Here we go:


Everything has it's up- and downsides. Here is some simple info-graphic for you: [ "BTC is closer to Fiat than gold when it comes to durability since it has no inherent physical attributes, which would make it durable on its own  – the BTC’s durability is essentially a function of network’s stability and its perceived security." Keep in mind that those values are relative. If you are expecting some catastrophic apocalyptic event, then true, get gold (it has physical representation and a high perceived scarcity). You just have to factor in how probable this event is and how high would be the motivation to keep the Bitcoin network alive, and if this offsets the possible loss of profits ��‍♂️


Gold (physical, not paper) has it's place as an investment, though I have met too many people lately that stopped acquiring gold and are now acquiring Bitcoin instead. Central banks are currently the ones that are buying most of the gold (they basically have no choice if they want to hedge themselves against the inflation they create, as buying Bitcoin would be extremely against their agenda). So I am not so sure about that " everybody and their dog is buying gold right now", the price chart does not seem to reflect that. That would be a valid point somewhere between 2006 and 2009-10.


Yes. Only \~21mBTC will ever be created. This constitutes it's scarcity. You would need to fork Bitcoin to try to increase this amount (and we all know how well BTC forks are doing). If you do not count assets that are one of a kind (n=1), then Bitcoin is one of the most scares assets we know of right now. Scarcity refers to the limited availability of an asset/commodity (meaning you cannot create more BTC, but you can always mine more gold, e.g. from the sea bed when it becomes profitable).


Your understanding of what money/value is extremely primitive. What if i determine the value of Bitcoin in gold? Why would I then need Fiat currency to inform me of the value? I would not care what you payed in Fiat for this gold as long as you give me the right amount of it. This means that Bitcoin is in no way reliant on Fiat. It would if it was pegged to some Fiat currency in some specific ratio. This was the stupidest thing you wrote by far!!!


The only reason we denominate everything in Fiat right now is because this is the most common payment system that everybody is familiar with. Before that it was gold, before that it was... i dunno, cows... before that see shells. That way it is just easier for us to grasp the abstract that is value. Abstract example: If I tell you that 1BTC is worth 5 cows, you will revert to the most common payment/exchange system you use? Real life example: I do not denominate BTC in Yen. If you tell me how much 1BTC is worth in JPY that tells me nothing (and probably tells you nothing either). If people want to get rich of Bitcoin it's fine by me. But they want to get rich in their "purchasing power" and not in Fiat (as Fiat value changes overtime  because of inflation - having 1000USD today is not the same as having it in 1900)
I hope this answered your question.

The anchor points are not random as you place them at the end of the candle wicks (lowest/highest values that allow specific part of the chart to be fully above/below a drawn trend line) and not some random point on the chart. The result is only an approximation of what is most probable that can happen based on historical data. Usually this prediction is correct for 2-4 bounces of the trend line. Beyond that the probability of the trend line being right/no breakout falls dramatically.
Also if you take into account that this chart does not really represent a "true" asset value, but is in fact a chart of human psychology it makes a lot more sense that you can predict future moves this way.
The major difference is in what kind of chart do you use. I found that using log. values yields better results.
This is surprisingly accurate for such an easy tool.

Parents in today's world do not know better (excluding interpersonal relationships). The world has changed beyond belief during their life times and they did not notice that. It may look similar on the outside, but the inner workings, successful economic strategies/choices are out of grasp for 80% of them in today's western world.
Example would be sending your kid to an university. University in of itself is not bad, it's just a question why you want to go there. Do you have enough money to pay for it out of pocket? Do you even need to go there? Who is going to be paying? If the kid is paying through debt, how is he going to repay it? And there is no way parent today can answer this question, as majority of them lacks knowledge, skills, intelligence or all of the above to come up with an optimal solutions for future they are simply unable to predict or even imagine.
I know a kid(s) who were put into crashing school debt because of their parents. Even though I (and the kid) advised against that (not speaking much since I told them "I told you so"). The kid will be in his middle forties when he pays it back. They killed him economically even though they meant no harm.
I know a 19y.o. who's parents thought it would be a good Idea for him to get a loan on a brand new car (he wanted a used one). Now he can barely afford the payments + fuel + insurance.
Hint: if your parent's aren't wealthy - they suck at economics.

Anywhere from 370k-440k USD/BTC (today's dollars equivalent) is easily obtainable within less then a decade as the network grows slowly and organically (based on current functionality Bitcoin is very undervalued and also kind of undervaluing the growth rate). Bitcoin is (even right now) in many ways better money so according to economic theory people will tend to hold on to "good money" and spend "weak money", so this will support Bitcoin's (current) deflationary trend (although Bitcoin is not deflationary in nature, as people want to make you believe). This is not taking into account central and investment banks entering the market in bulk.
Now, beyond that it is quite hard for me to say and I would think that this is in a realm of pure speculation. That said: you will see a 1m USD/BTC (face value at future time) price, just not as McAfee said, you will have to wait more then till end of 2020.

BTC is still relatively low to maybe mid-liquidity market. Just look how much the price swings when somebody buys/sells 500BTC at once on the exchanges (that is only a 5mUSD trade at today's prices).

If you are living paycheck to paycheck you should really look at your spending habits. You can always save, invest, get a second job. In such case investing in gold (99,999% 0,1oz coins) or BTC would be most optimal solution (small amounts of capital you have will limit you in your investment capabilities, so those would be safest ones).
Having low income is no reason not to save or to invest.

There is nothing wrong with high transaction fees. This is how the market works. More miners can join the system. This is an encouragement for becoming a miner. Small fees are not good for miner.

Why should the fact that it is being used as a store of value (because of digital scarcity and that is very hard to be taken away by some other party) be concerning? High transaction fees have no impact on anything if you conciser it a price to pay for the benefits of blockchain.
I can give an example with cars. We had electric cars at the beginning of 1900's, but we have switched to ICB engines instead. Both were means of moving the automobile. just fine, but one was more functional at the time then the other. Now the roles are changing again. Maybe in the future we will use Bitcoin as a currency... we will see.
Not every case (in case of cryminal activity) requires the coin to have any value other then the blockchain. Coins can be used to exchange information about debt between two or more individuals and the end or mid-end resoult would be exchanging the end balance IRL. (+30-50-45+70=10 - you need to move only 10 units *agreed_exchange_rate IRL instead of 195 units when there would be no blockchain to keep track of changes (everyone watches everyone which is a very important thing for security in a cryminal's world) - simple risk management.
The fact that they are starting to accept altcoins is not concerning IMO, but worth mentioning.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:37:53
Yeah, but my point is that they are "printing" them in a _digital_ form (mostly). When there is a printing press shown on TV this is not the real way money is being made/produced. Everyone says that there is a difference between FIAT and BTC in the "being digital" part - I just can't see it myself.

The problem with Bcash is that it is taking the "easy way out". It is like fixing your high end DSLR with scotch-tape - sure.... it can work for a while, but it is not a long term solution. I suspect (but I have no proof that it will happen) that Bcash will face the same problems BTC is going through right now, without a solution that is much different of what BTC community is now doing. They will have to admit that they have to adapt same technologies BTC is adopting right now. This would be a dead end for them, as they will have to admit to being wrong at the begining (that will render Bcash virtually worthless and pump BTC price up, as people are scared of betting on the wrong whorse they feel cheated about)) or they hard-fork and the new fork copies solutions from BTC, which will devalue Bcash andbtransfervthat value to BTC.
I really want to believe that Bcash will succeed and that it may be a good investment (so public can profit) but people involved in it seem to be a bit close minded and avoid or reject any criticism towards their coin.
I do not hold any Bcash at the moment and never had, but if I had I would exchange them for BTC as soon as I could.

... and how do you add those extra BTC to a blockchain? It's like counter-fitting USD. Bitcoin only exists as a list of transactions not as an individual entity. 
... and taking a credit in BTC would be madness, just as taking a credit in gold (both have a deflationary end-game). You can take a short term credit before the market is fully mature (when mining is still possible - not even mentioning profitable), but after that you would be mad to take a credit that you have to pay back in the same currency. If you don't have to pay back in the same currency you may conciser this transaction as a simple sale of BTC for other currency (crypto or not). So it's either stupid or impossible in the long run (IMO).

Your arguments are sound indeed. I am stressing the digital part but only in regards of FIAT currencies. But it still doesn't answer my question. Why do people treat those two things differently?

@_date: 2017-12-20 21:50:05
Yes they are... but this software is a bit different don't you think? You can't really pay with MS windows CD's, can you?
I just don't get where the initial value comes from since it is just a derivative of the amount of coins somebody had. I can make a fork each day, and generate new coins. 
IMO coins should start with ICO, and that's it. Just my opinion. It has nothing to do with programming.
and if it comes to Bcash, making the block bigger is not a permanent remedy (if you have some programming and mathematic skill you should figure it out). If that would be the case block would be as big as the sky. Bcash will fork in the future because of that, as they will have to implement similar solution as Bitcoin. They took a step backwords stating that it is a huge leap forward.

Those "extra" coins would be worthless. It's like counterfitting a Picasso. You can make a perfect copy but it's not Picasso. There would be a problem with lack of compatibility, as the true blockchain will concider those coins as invalid and you will not be able to use them through blockchain. Not using blockchain brings back the double-spending problem which makes the new coins worthless... this would be hard to overcome. There would have to be destinction between the true an "new" coins so there is clarity on how and when can you use one or the other. Something like...... BTC and BCC. there would have to be two seperate chains. BTC protocol is extremaly simple and that does not give the enemy many attack vectors.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:47:46
Ummmm... I don't get it.
I _am_ saying that BTC is _superior_ to FIAT and that ordinary people _already_ use digital currency all the time. It's like every banknote in the world is just a paper wallet that stores value of FIAT. I am just wondering why is everybody looking at BTC as being digital and at the same time say that money that is ~92% digital is in fact physical. Makes no sense to me. Maybe BTC would be easier adoptable when ordinary people would just notice that they already are familiar with using digital cash.

Think of it this way. It is something you have to go through as an investor (also outside of "crypto"). It is better to lose 500$ then 500 million $:)
... and I believe you might be looking at this a bit wrong. Try this. How about you didn't lose anything, but you have bought yourself a turbo-education. Crash course 101. You have learned something about your psyche. Look up a what is the yearly tuition at a collage you would like to attend to. If you have lost close to that It is still a great deal. You got yourself more experience then you could ever gain in such a short time:D
Oh... and I lost many TIMES on this dip too. I panic sold... but quickly rebought (my decision did not fit my strategy, and was emotional + few times + god damn fees). I lost "money", but in the end I gained satoshis:D The multiplier of future gain will be better. But now I would appear to be at a loss:D (Because of some recent forces outside of my power) I have invested my _last_ savings in BTC (not the situation at the time of putting money in), so if I lose a substantial amount I am bit fucked:D ... so chill out and rethink your strategies (maybe the strategies are ok, but execution was wrong or vice versa). The gains you have expected were probably overrealistic or you have chosen too small of a time frame. 
You might still be right and it is just a dead cat's bounce. Who knows? That is the beauty of it. Even with all of the supports in the world every outcome is possible:D

Well you can worry about low volumes, but you might also consider that the culture here is HODL (bit religious). That may (or may not) explain the lack of volume. When holders do not want to sell the buyers (market) will have to negotiate a higher price. Good for holders as long as the sentiment lasts:)

The _best_ endgame scenario (IMO) would be high adoption rates for crypto-currencies combined with highly distributed mining volume (billions of low-hash-rate devices - e.g. through an app on a phone). You can "vote" on the coin by providing it mining power from your phone/device. You might or might not be compensated for that (the compensation will be so distributed with such high hash rate that the reword would be also distributed). This might even coexist with the existing mining eco-system.
Just an idea.

- First of all - Chinese people are not the same as the Chinese government. nobody is calling anybody names.
- Second - China is not a free/democratic/non-authoritarian state so putting so many nodes in this country must bring suspicions. This choice says a lot about the intentions of Bcash creators. Money at an expense of currency security. One player (China) would be able to bring the Bcash network to a stop long enough to crash the currency. This can bring other crypto-currencies down as well or skyrocket them. China or the creators of Bcash are playing a dangerous game here in the name of self interest

I see the value of the blockchain that is backing up the new coin, but I am merely stating that no other value was put into creating those coins, which makes them inferior in my opinion. Also I wonder how will this impact peoples sentiment to Bcash (or any other fork). I know that it is secured by the computation of the Bitcoin chain at the beginning. 
... aaaaaaand ... Size of the block is not a problem specific to blockchains... you know that, don't you? Do your research yourself. You might learn something new (or not, cause maybe you have already knew it all (note: no sarcasm)). The underlying technology is that from Satoshi's whitepaper (Bcash i mean) with just bigger blocks. Can't you imagine a trading volume that will cause the new network to experience the same problems? It is postponing the inevitable without looking at the problem as a whole. This whole thing stinks of lack of imagination.

Hmmmm... and you have mentioned about another thing that bothers me (OFF TOPIC!). Deflationary Spiral has never been fully observed and remains a theory. Japan has deflation since mid 1990s and their economy seems to be quite stable for the last decade (even with all those demographic problems they have). I am not saying that deflation is good, but I ain't saying that it is bad either. We always try to manage inflation (which is not very capitalistic in essence) and maybe we should be looking at those forces as natural things that occurre that self-regulate the market. Everybody says that deflation is bad. But there is not much evidence for that. There is no country that went bankrupt because of deflation, but there are countries that went bankrupt because of inflation (or hyperinflation what ever you want to call it)... I don't know :/

Quick example from business area. In China you are unable to compete with your product (even if it is superior) because your company may not be Chinese enough or what ever. Chinese solutions to replace Facebook, Youtube etc. suck a bit to be honest. The only thing they made really well is WeChat. but this was only possible without full business freedoms. Since all your conversations can be viewed by the Chinese government you can sure assume they will be (because of corruption for eg.) used to some extent for somebody's personal gain. You have no guarantee (and the Chinese government is quite open about it) that your conversation will not be listened to. Now imagine that you have to give somebody very secret and important business information (concerning your internal company affairs). Still don't know why this is bad? Insider Trading rings a bell? Or do you really believe that China is one of a kind and there is no corruption and crime there. If you think so you clearly have not lived in China or even went there as a tourist. You would see lots of scammers on the streets. 
... aaaand centralized China and decentralized Bitcoin don't really go together ideologically. Don't you think? Putting so many nodes on servers of just one company in one state (which is openly authoritarian to add to the thrill) is incompetent (if not malicious behavior)

Well... why should it be?
We have bounced back from 12000USD which is a hard support on the chart (long-term). The price "should" hover for a bit around the price we have now (around 13000USD).
This dip was innevitable, as the price rose in the last month quicker then the historical trend would predict. This was a "curb your enthusiasm" dip. Chart returned to it's historical trend line now. This actually supprising if you think what were the forces that were bringing it down (bcash, coinbase, yubit, roger ver, LTC founder sell all, media, etc). This all happened at the same time, yet the price did not fall below the 12000USD support.
I know that Bitcoin is not like stocks, but lets assume that Bitcoins are stocks of "Bitcoin Corp.". This company just survived hostile take over, media FUD, database hacking and a dishonest competitor. Those stocks didn't dip below hard support from few weeks before... You would jump on those stock in an instance, as they have proveen themselfs to be able to withstand such attacks possibly in the future.
What REALLY supprises me is that we did not dip to 11000USD with following stagnation around 12kUSD. That would bounce the chart below the historical trendline for a while. This hasn't happen, or yet happend. But if it does the new dip "should" recover shortly.
Look at BTC logarythmic chart (1 year), ignore all the spikes, and you will have left is quite a nice line without any sygnificant dips.
We just flew too high and we had to get back to the "norm". I would say that this is now a good time to buy some coins (but I can always be wrong).
The real question for me is: why did the price rose so much in the last month despite all the shit that was going on around Bitcoin. Does that show Bitcoin's strenght or people's high expectations regarding crypto-currencies... andbwhat does it mean for future spikes and dips?
I don't believe in jinxing, but I can always be wrong (probability of that should be always assumed to be high).

Yup... why are you supprised?

Getting a 500k mortgage while earning 100k is not an economically optimal solution if the real estate will not be bringing you extra income. Do people do it? Sure! Would their long term financial situation be better if they wouldn't? In most cases yes.
The National debt is owed by the whole public (meaning each and every citizen, also the owner of that 500k mortgage) . So a citizen's true debt level is private + his share of national debt.
The problem with a high national debt to GDP ratio is that debts have to be rolled along the way (this is not some one big debt but thousands upon thousands of different debts with different terms associated).
Lets get back to your mortgage example: You get 500k earning 100ka. This debt will have a fixed rate (if you decide on an adjustable rate... well, remember all those "2008" people that got wiped out on the US real estate market?). But national debts (because they have to be constantly rolled) are in fact an adjustable rate loans with no expiry date (if you keep finding lenders). This rate is determined by the lender based purely on his "trust" that you are going to be able to repay him a higher value (not amount). Do you see now that this might be a dangerous situation in some circumstances?

The company does not have a way to exercise a vote, but the vote is still there until the stock exists for reissuance. When a stock becomes treasury stock it does not mean it magically disappears it's still on the books. It still exists until the it gets retired. The weigh of your vote does not really increase till there is a clear exit plan for the treasury stocks. If they get retired, yes. If they get reissued, then no.

This share is not split equally among other shareholders as it does not increase their vote. Those shares still exist. The company owns the shares and it is the company that has this vote (such entities are most often then not legal persons, don't forget that). The reason the price rises is because of the artificial demand created, not because everyone got an extra piece of the pie. 
... and as per your example:


4 is total supply? So You have 2 stocks (50% of total supply), I own 1 (25% of total supply) and the company owns 1 (25% of total supply). The board of directors (or managing director) does act on behalf of the share owners, but now the board of directors has a saying with those 25% of total supply. This did not increase your vote... get it? Nothing changed for you except the stock price.
The problem arises when the company does not wish to go private again after buy backs and will either have to keep those stocks on their books or sell them to free the capital locked in those assets.

Shares are not an expression of monetary value but of ownership. By "destroying" a share you own you would effectively destroy your ownership of the underlying asset and distribute that value among other existing shareholders. This means you would just give away the money you spent on the buy-back to other shareholders.️ What a great business decision this would be. No. It does not work that way. You hold on to your shares (for various reasons).

Can confirm. I am rocking a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (set 4GB swap to avoid OOM issues), 16GB microSD card and some chinese 4A power supply (2.5A is more then enough, but I am splitting this power line to power a miner directly from power supply). Connected external devices are: External 1TB 2.5 in. HDD (salvaged from an old laptop) and one GakkoScience 2Pak miner. The whole thing cost me around 70USD to assamble (got the miner and drive for free).

In theory free trade is not a zero-sum game. But along the way there are also negotiations which may result in non-symetric benefits. Just because both parties can benefit does not necessarily mean they will.
If you think that free trade is always a zero-sum game why did the Brits got rekt by EU negotiators. It's a free trade deal, buz yoi don't like it do you?

Your economics skills saddens me. 
1. Nobody needs to pay for those missing UK contributions. This will only shrink EU's budget, but then there will be only 27 recepients instead of 28. This budget does not pay for external debt or anything like that, so it's just a smaller pie to devide between remaining countries. There are already countries that confirmed that they will be willing to chip in the missing funds. Furthermore UK's contributions for years were not proportional because of the rabates UK got back in the Tacher era. EU will not be better of without UK, but the impact will be nothing like the impact on UK's economy, simply because of the scales of the available markets. UK has to options: leave with a deal and be tied to EU for as long EU decides it benefits the union or leave without a deal and get eaten by everyone around. No good choices at the table at this point for UK saddly. EU on the other hand, should do quite fine (although it will also take a small hit)
2. EU is a democratic organisation. Such arguments as "undemocratic centralized EUDSSR" are just silly. For democracy to exist not all positions are or even have to, or should be directly elected by the public. (Most probably) Where you live, you do not directly elect the Minister of Health or a Secretary of State. Thinking that democracy is when everybody is elected by the public directly is non-sence and missinterpretation how democracy works. You elect your representatives to vote in your name. This means that if you elect an EU MP and he votes for somebody to be elected President of the European Commision that does not mean this is not democratic. Same thing if they appoint someone a possition at an external agency, it is still democratic as you have ceeded your right to vote on this matter when a representative was chosen by tge majority.

Oh... and as for the argument that "we are gonna sign a deal with the US, they are our friends": you gonna be eaten by the US in the negotiations because of your weak possition in the negotiations (UK loses much more if the deal does not get signed, as US risk basically nothing)

This was not a "proposed deal" but something that the UK government has negotiated and agreed to. They did their best with what they had. Too bad it wasn't much. US will go over UK like a steam roller in trade negotiations, as for UK those negotiations will be time sensitive. Sorry.
Reclaiming sovereignty and economy is secondary? Right. Why does this argument come up whenever the supporters of Brexit have no economic arguments for it. And you will not gain much sovereignty by leaving EU, you won't even notice it. 
But there will be a price to pay for that. The worst case scenario would be UK splitting, as EU will gladly take Scotland and N.Irland back very quickly. That will put England in a very poor geopolotical situation.

As long as I get no notification that some service(s) have failed I don't even touch my setup. I just let it do it's thing. For me it's just "fire and forget". If I ever mine a block I will see it in my wallet, any other thing just does not interest me all that much��

Is a static IP required to run a Lightning Node?
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:06:00
It is very simple:
* P2PKH Address - starting with 1 - is the address is the default/legacy address format for BTC
* P2SH Address - starting with 3 - is the SegWit enabled address (more transactions per block resulting in lower fees and also fixes transaction malleability (ability to change the txid before the tx is confirmed on the blockchain)
It is up to the wallet creator to implement SegWit (or Bech32) functionality into their software. Why don't they do it at this point? Laziness I guess (as the controversies regarding implementing SegWit mostly died off by now) and not caring about the blockchain nor the users of their software.

You should use:

to verify the number of active connections. If you see connections there you then have a full node.
Copy-paste your IP to Bitnodes. Check if the port on the site is set to 8333. If this fails maybe there is some problem on their side.
If you can see connections you are on the network.

Reasoning: BTC price can easly achive 150k-250k USD in a decade as adoption spreds and new generations enter the market. No inflation. Cannot be "printed". Costs me nothing to store my assets even for 100 years. I can easly prove that I have right to those assets by holding a copy of the ledger (running full node).

    10 BTC = 1 gsat (GIGASATOSHI!!!��) 
... but you are simply proposing the use of satoshis as the base unit of measure. "k" as in "kilo" is a mathematical power prefix only. Kilometer means simply 10^3 ˟ meter... so 10 kg = 10 ˟ 10^3 ˟ gram. As you can see the only unit here is the meter/gram. Kilogram is not a separate unit.

But could it be possible that your lawyers are in fact shit? She is trying to \_sell\_ you the custody of your child. That could mean that there is little to none emotional connection towards your son. That is a good spin for a lawyer, don't you think (depends a bit on your local law)?. I would file for full custody ASAP if I'd have this "deal" in writing. Best if she can print it, sign it, and send it to you by post for you to sign, so there is only one signature on it when you receive it and it's hers. And I wouldn't pay her anything (at least not more then half of all savings, and not a dime from what I had before the marriage). She want's to leave you with your child and no money. All savings and 50% of salary for 3 years? And you and your lawyer OKed this??? Are you both for real? Will you even be left with a sufficient amount of money/assets to take care of your son properly ("*(...)and walking away with more than anyone could have imagined*" seems to mean that you ain't no billionaire)??? 
First of all calculate how much money can she put into her lawyer(s). If you can spend 4x as much as her, she might be majorly screwed (sorry to burst your bubble, but money helps in court. A LOT!).
Don't fall for this emotional blackmail. I went through a divorce last year after 6 years of marriage. My advise to you my friend is: fight like a fucking lion for everything you can (son, money, car, house, TV, carpets, paint on the walls... every. fucking. thing.). Offense is the best defense. In my case that cost MUCH less then my ex-wife's claims - had to pay a lawyer, but she got shit and had to pay me a small sum in the end (and that I wish you too + getting full custody of your son)
Also think about it this way. You will be giving her the money for your son's collage, for his dreams, his first car, his potential medical bills, for when he might be in real need. This could be a jump start in his life. You are a fucking man and you are responsible for your child well being, no matter if he is by your side, or not. So think about your son's future.... and no, love and having each other is sadly not enough IRL (again sorry if I burst your bubble).
With 23BTC worth you can probably destroy her in court (that's 130K USD for legal (sorry to burst your bubble, but having money in the pocket really helps to win in court).
Negotiate. Gather evidence. Approach a different lawyer. Pay him for few hours out of pocket to talk about possible strategies and and his point of view. Best to pay your lawyers with the savings you have (as you still have right to at least half, don't you?) so that the harder and longer she fights in court, the less money will be left potentially for her in the end. Approach r/LegalAdvise
TL;DR: It is a shitty solution for you my friend.

can you make a full set for sale?
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:52:49
... and your full balance is at risk ;)

Can't Blockstream sign it then?

LMAO! ........ but that non-SegWit address at the end though :|

Oh great! Thanks! Now I trust it. Let me hold my keys in it. /s

Is it "China banning Bitcoin" time again?
@_date: 2019-05-22 09:28:30
It has mostly nothing to do with BTC adoption but with economic illiteracy (here at it's finest). If they were offered 1 USD or 1000000 JPY the answer would be the same.
Furthermore those people exhibit a total lack of ability to resist instant gratification. They also did not seek any info prior to giving an answer. I see some grim economic future for most of them (and their student loans going down the drain). Well... I mean... somebody has to be poor so others can be wealthy in comparison ;)

75 cents per transaction to move your coins to anywhere in the world is to high for you? :|
@_date: 2019-05-19 00:28:42
safer estimate would be 19m I think
@_date: 2019-05-09 12:37:19
The sheer fact he even mentioned it made him look incompetent. At least we all got a good lough out of it.

OP, here is a question for you: Would you give the API keys to your account to somebody you don't even know?

where is this chart from? cannot find it on bitmex

That is if she does not sue for full custody later. Then: no money, no son and hello alimony payments ;)
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:25:59


I have no idea how you calculated that, but with a 2% annual inflation in 10 years you will lose about 20% (not 50%) of purchasing power.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:46:32
Yeah, Bitcoin **is** the exit strategy!
@_date: 2019-05-03 12:56:13
thank you
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:13:54
Yeah, learn to math first! Zero times infinity is undefined. Meaning that it is nor 0 nor infinity, nor any other number. Technically it is a undefined real number.

So why do you advertise this solution to the general public?
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:01:51


Until the service provider rolls back your transaction. If you are a seller you may remain with no funds and no goods. Been there, done that (PayPal).
