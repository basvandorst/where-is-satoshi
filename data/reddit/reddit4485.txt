What are you talking about?  The fact that a mempool even exists means there isn't enough room in each block to handle the number of transactions.  The backlog of transactions is the mempool!  So the size of the mempool is maxed out and the number of transactions just depends on what type the miner chooses to include in the block (for instance if they choose segwit more transactions will be in the block).
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:44:08

When BCASH was opened on Coinbase someone was artificially inflating the price buying tons at $9,500 while it was around $3,400 on other exchanges.  This was to make it appear it was worth more than it really was.  This was so bad that Coinbase stopped the trading 4 minutes after it was introduced.  Also, there was  a ton of buying prior to the supposedly secret introduction of BCASH on Poloniex exchange proving insider trading was occurring (Coinbase says their investigating this).  Roger Ver (a BCASH proponent) said insider trading is fine and we need more of it in a recent interview.  This led to a huge distrust of cryptocurrencies as a whole and a massive selloff.

Ver wants BCASH to replace money.  Just to cover the transactions that visa carries would take over 500 MB blocks every 10 minutes.  It’s not a scaling solution and would centralize BCASH even more.  That’s why off Blockchain transactions on the lightning network are much better.  It would be much faster and is much more scalable.

Getting rid of ASICBoost is an argument for Segwit (not against).  ASICBoost allows miners to only selectively choose certain transactions to reduce the amount of energy needed to mine bitcoin (by 20-30%).  The energy needed provides Proof of Work that secures bitcoin from attacks from bad actors.  So you can think of ASICBoost as reducing bitcoins security by 20-30%.  Also ASICBoost is mined using antminers but this type of mining rig also has a secret kill switch (called antbleed) which mining pools can use to shut them down.  So really it centralizes power to mining pools.  IMO the reason Bitcoin Cash hardforked was because the implementation of segwit would block ASICBoost.

There are many.  BCASH is almost exclusively mined using antminers.  These are chips that mine using ASICBoost.  ASICBoost hacks the Proof of Work algorithm by only choosing certain transactions to mine and saves about 20-30% energy.  However, this means less work is used to mine BCASH making it less secure.  This is why BCASH hardforked because you can't use ASICBoost with segwit.  Also, the antminers have a secret kill switch (called antbleed) allowing mining pools to shut them down by just sending a kill signal.  This allows them to shut down almost all mining whenever they want.  Antminers also broadcast the IP address so its not anonymous.  All these make BCASH more centralized and under control of the few.  Ver also thinks you can scale by increasing block size to 8 MB which is stupid.  Why?  Well lets say you wanted to scale to the number of transactions that VISA supports.  You'd need over 500 MB blocks.  Eventually, the size of the block chain would be so big only the rich few would be able to mine which centralizes everything.  That's why bitcoin doesn't scale by increasing block size.  Instead, they allow transactions outside the blockchain (something called the Lightning Network).  An example of this would be if Alice gave Bob one bitcoin which Bob then gave Joe.  This would be 2 transactions.  However, if Alice gave Joe one bitcoin directly it would only be 1 transaction and achieve the same thing.  The Lightning Network would take these 2 transactions and turn it to 1 which would be added to the blockchain thus saving space.

There are greener cryptos.  For instance Burst coin is 500,000 times more efficient than bitcoin in terms of energy use.  Burst coins are mined using the amount of hard drive space dedicated to mining.  Hard drives use little energy and make mining completely ASIC resistant. It was also the first crypto to have Turing complete smart contracts (yes, even before ethereum!) and has an active dedicated group of coders working to improve the coin.

BAKKT is skewed towards long positions since it's physically settled.  
"Second, Bakkt’s futures will be physically settled, which is a game-changer and could bring in more institutional volume. This is due to the fact that physically delivered futures require the actual purchase of bitcoins. If investors want to go long, they would need to have enough funding. If they want to go short, they would need to have enough Bitcoin. This model seems fair but in reality it is skewed towards long position. For instance, short position requires having Bitcoin as your proof of asset; if you profit from going short, then it also means that the value of Bitcoin decreases. In the case of long position, you not only profit from the growth of transaction but also from the value of Bitcoin itself. In the long run, Bakkt benefits those who hold their Bitcoin."

Actually, the real issue here is about fungibility not fake gold.  The gold bars they're talking about contain highly pure gold but the stamp on them has been faked to make it look like it was produced by a legitimate source.  They think Chinese miners faked the stamp of legitimate refineries to sell gold that was made in an illegitimate way.  There are KYC and AML laws that only allow you to buy gold from ligitimate sources.  Kind of like conflict diamonds except with gold.  So it turns out that gold in not very fungible.

I respect that every miner adds to the security of bitcoin.  At the same time, every penny spent on an antminer (made by Bitmain and run by Jihan Wu) gives money to someone hostile to bitcoin and will do anything to promote BCASH.  Blockstream just opened a gigantic mining facility able to mine 10% of bitcoin's hash rate that purposely DID NOT HAVE any antminers to promote decentralization of bitmain and China.  Wouldn't it be better to promote other types of rigs not made by bitmain unless they prove they will not be hostile to bitcoin in the future!

The new BCH difficulty adjustment makes this much harder.  The BTC hash rate is actually going up (see fork.lol).  I think there needs to be an increase in transaction fees on non-segwit transactions.  This will increase segwit adoption and make it more difficult to flood the mempool. If segwit adoption gets high enough it will also make it harder to mine using ASICBoost.

Maybe I'm missing something but it would seem to be harder for BCH to attack with the new EDA.  Lets say miners switch to BCH increasing hash rate.

No they're legit.  People thought they weren't real rigs because they were restricted from showing them due to patent negotiations (which is now over).  They use Overt ASICBoost (Bitmain uses Covert ASICBoost) which is compatible with segwit. Overt ASICBoost is better because companies use it for free as long as they don't enforce their own mining patents.  This forces a more even playing field for everyone.  Alternatively, Covert ASICBoost by Bitmain is incompatible with segwit and they use proprietary technology that they've sued others for.

Not exactly.  Its true BCASH copied and pasted the code and transactions for bitcoin and slightly modified things to increase block size.  However, they also removed segwit.  The reason is BCASH was forked for miners to make more money.  Segwit allows more transactions per block that cost less.  Also, segwit blocks ASICBoost, a hack to the mining algorithm (SHA256) that takes 30% less energy to mine bitcoins (this also makes bitcoin 30% less secure).  Jihan (the mastermind behind BCASH) makes mining rigs that implement ASICBoost and didn't want to mine coins on an even playing field.  So he made BCASH without segwit.  BCASH is also controlled centrally.  BCASH is exclusively mined using Jihan's mining rigs.  He installed a kill switch (called ANTBLEED) where he can disable whatever rig he wants.  He also made the rigs transmit IP addresses back to him so its not anonymous mining.  Do you think its good that one person can threaten to take down the entire currency unless you do what he wants?  Finally, segwit is compatible with the lightning network.  People often think of bitcoin as old and outdated because it was the first cryptocurrency.  However, the lightning network makes bitcoin's blockchain the most innovative out there.  Instant transactions for almost free, atomic swaps that allow you to exchange bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies, etc.

Not only that but the start of the bitcoin crash from $20,000 started exactly when BCASH was offered on Coinbase.  Insider traders knew it was going to be offered and started buying on poloniex before it was available on Coinbase.  After it was available, someone was buying on Coinbase at almost 3 times the normal price to make it seem like it was worth more than it was. It was so bad Coinbase halted trading and Armstrong had to warn his own employees not to release privileged information. Then Roger Ver admitted insider trading was happening and said it was great for everyone. However this whole episode caused people to panic and all crypto currencies suffered.  Now BCASH is worth way less than before the insider trading happened and all others cryptos suffered along with it. I know a lot of other things contributed to the crash but insider trading of BCASH was what precipitated it all.  Why would anyone want to buy a coin where a select few have insider knowledge that the rest of us don’t have?

I thought it was about the Bahamas too but if you go to google trends and type in "bitcoin" a menu will drop.  If you select the "Currency" option it shows bitcoin searches are skyrocketing.  This "currency" option looks for all searches about currency that includes bitcoin in the search term.  Its a more general way to search for trends.  This may or may not be manipulation but it's interesting.
  
Saw it mentioned in this article:

The big difference is BCASH was created and is owned by miners for miners and their profits.  That's like banks controlling your money.  Look at the upcoming BCH hard fork.  Jihan Wu and company just said this is the fork and deal with it.  No voting or consensus, they're just going to do it and if you don't like it than it sucks for you.  The thing is they're losing the battle and becoming desperate which is why Ver is committing outright fraud.  It's so bad antpool is literally destroying 12% of their mined BCASH to decrease supply and pump price.

If you're wondering why BCASH has been increasing in price recently it's because antpool is literally throwing away 12% of the BCASH they mine to artificially increase supply.  It's a desperate move to try and pump price in order to stay relevant.

This will probably get worse because BCH will undergo a premature halvening due to their disastrous initial fork and overmining of coins.  There will be less motivation to mine with less coins awarded and, probably, a decreased hash rate.

FYI, C0bra is co-owner of bitcoin.org.  Look it up!

Did you even read the article?  It says the mempool was empty so the transaction was cleared.  That's not a favor!  It's what any mining pool would do!

I found this online about the white papers copyright status
 
Copyright Protection on Blockchain Applications and White Papers. 
 A developer’s white paper and computer code are typically protected by copyright as soon as they are written, as copyright in a creative work of authorship automatically springs into existence (with a very low threshold for creativity), and there is no registration requirement for copyright protection in the U.S. Any original work of authorship, such as a white paper or computer code, is covered by copyright at the moment it is “ fixed in any tangible medium of expression.”10

CZ said the stolen bitcoins were from a hot wallet which represents only 2% of their holdings with the rest on a cold wallet.  If 7,000 bitcoins is 2% then 100% is 350,000.  Of course this assumes there’s not other cold wallets out there.

60 minutes usually has 3 unrelated stories and the last one was about bitcoin this time. The best part was the first story about large banks being involved in a quarter of a trillion dollar money laundering scheme. Ironic considering critics always talk about bitcoin being involved in illegal activity!

Volume is easy to fake but price isn't because it leaves opportunities for arbitrage. If you artificially offer bitcoin for more than its worth than people will buy it and sell at another exchange for profit. Exchanges wash trade (buy and sell to themselves) all the time because they don't lose that much money doing it and the volume makes them seem more important (i.e. listing on coinmarketcap). That's why it's easy to fake volume but not price. Arguing this is all due to fake volume makes no sense!!!!
