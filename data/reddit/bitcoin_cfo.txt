So what the market considers a bubble.....
@_date: 2016-04-12 04:25:50
10Xs is too much so don't get your hopes up.  Price must stay above $280 per bitcoin for miners to have flat profits.  Max price after the halving, dictated by margin trades, $1600 though I even doubt that.

This is a subject I have actually talked to a few lawyers about.
Easiest case, and I know I may get flack for this, have your coins in Coinbase.  Just as a Bank in the U.S., coinbase goes through the same procedures, death certificate, will/trust, or estate affidavit procedures to release funds to another individual.
Otherwise, I'd recommend having a Safe Deposit Box with your private key written out, and leave ownership of said box through a will.

Either demand goes up along with the price, or it fails.  Miners cannot survive if Bitcoin is below $220ish after this upcoming halving.

Was it staggered transactions or did you just go above $10,000 in moved coins?

This would be a concern with coinbase as Bank of America, or any other bank, would not be able to verify bitcoin transactions/sales.
Was their a way coinbase had given any information to the bank or a claim was created from the bank against a transaction with coinbase to allow the information exchanged between the 2?

It's not specific although I can assure you that they operate in the same manner and by the same laws.

(Goes directly to comments)
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:22:23
This is where the focus is driven in to what "will" be.
First people need to become familiar with Bitcoin to start accepting it and using it.  Currently, there is no true need to use it as currency in shops other than security for yourself and lower transaction fees for those businesses.
What "will" be is a hybrid of cash, checks, and debit cards.
Some people will still want to use cash so consider Bitcoin a blanket over all currencies for you to exchange depending on where you live.   "I travel Mexico, I go to a bank and exchange a Bitcoin for Pesos, use pesos, when leaving Mexico go back to bank convert peso into BTC."  As Bitcoins acceptance with Merchants goes up this won't be necessary.
Some people use checks which have everything to do with Trust and authenticity.   Bitcoin and the blockchain will make it easier to show transfer in ownership of funds and make it easier for banks to show that there are funds.
No holds or processing any longer since Bitcoin has a value behind it so it's easy to either "cash" or hold on to for transactions with merchants.
And finally wires.  Risk goes up but transaction speed and costs go down for consumers.
To answer your question, use of Bitcoin currently is to create the ideology of what it will be.

All other replies other than the gentleman's above is rubbish.  What allows traditional banks to succeed is convenience and only convenience for the mass, not for smaller pockets of people.  As corporatism and technology grows, people will flock towards alternatives that continue the same convenience factor, while catering to the core objective of banking; safeguarding funds while have access to those funds regardless of place or time.

Well, I was a Senior VP for that central system, learned weaknesses and operational gaps in risks, applied that knowledge to bitcoin, made that risk the central banks had into a selling point of the blockchain which transferred risk over which created their adoption of the technology that was actually them signing their right to die.....
Got it?

Depends on your balances.
Banks do not steal, people do not read disclosures.  Don't like them, don't use them, no reason to complain about them.  
Just as with bitcoin, don't like it, don't use it, no reason to complain about volatility or transaction times if you read the core issues.

The holders from the beginning have more power than what most think.  You own more shares in a company, you can dictate the price.
Decentralization needs to be spread throughout the market rather than huge farms.  21 is doing this. Miners have the ability to unload on the market causing the swings and fluctuation of pricing.  Limit their ability to sell or amount they mine, stability begins.

If and when our current system co-opts with digital currencies it will merely be the transitional period.  Bitcoin will be used as a token for validation and trustless peer to peer payment method, (new check system).   Walk up to an ATM and cash your "digital check."  
In regards to not allowing centralization of Bitcoin is where it gets rocky.  With our $3.5 billion market cap, how easy would it be for others to acquire their so called competition?

**"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs."**

Your debit card transactions are processed by Visa/MasterCard/etc which will take a few days longer when returning funds, similar to returning an item.  Usually for people whom have MoneyNetwork or Debit Cards from their employer.
Depositing into an account usually takes 1-3 Business day and the deposit is made to your bank similar to a direct deposit.  Best case scenario, Tuesday.

*"bitcoin will inevitably enter the discussion."*
With many prime investors, and them having a **large** cache of coins, a country will not even consider implementation, let alone speak of it.
The lower the price goes, the easier distribution of early adopters coins will happen by them choosing to part ways.  This is what these countries want for their benefit and their control.
We shouldn't want adoption by any country.

You are some mind reader, clearly understanding the sorrow I felt.  I dont belittle, I preach fact based off of the opinions which others state.  Take a large inhale of air, realize that trolling is just the emotion you wish to exude.

RTO would be nonexistent for a bitcoin related commercial or even the mention of it.
My money's on seeing someone with a "Send me BTC" sign during pregame, which by the way, if someone is in Glendale AZ and can get a sign on that pregame show, I'll fund you 1BTC.

"Good Afternoon,
First off, thank you for the website as it has become a household used site in our home.  Keep up the fantastic work.
The other day my wife and I were watching one of your Most Popular sectioned movies when my wife questioned the Ads that come up and the price paid to Los Movies for playing the Ads per watch.
Obviously with my email and subject you can see my passion and commitment to showing the possibilities of Bitcoin and the merchants that support transacting from bitcoin to fiat currencies, currently at no cost (Bitpay, Coinbase, etc.)
What if rather than showing these Ads, which may be cumbersome to the user, there was a way to Pay-per-View with bitcoin, which would transact almost instantaneously allowing the user to avoid the Ads?
Now I am in no stance to be aware of the fees paid to Los Movies by the Ads watched before the media shown, however I am aware that users, like myself, would be willing to pay in order to avoid the Ads.
I look forward to your response and as stated above, thank you for the service.
-Bitcoin CFO"
There you go. Wife and I discussed this the other day and sent this over to them.
