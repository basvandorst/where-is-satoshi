Really well written letter... it's a shame WSJ didn't just get you to write the article :)

There was a story a few weeks back about a guy who went to pay his bill in BitCoin using a QR code. He scanned the bill and sent the money, but it never got through. Turns out, some high tech hacker sticky tapped their own QR code over the top of the restaurants. No one tell Gox about this, or they might call it a flaw in the protocol and hold withdrawals back longer. :)

I didn't read all the responses (there were a lot)... but from what I did read, I didn't see anyone raise what I think is the most important point of all. Who "deserves" to be rich? How much is a "fair" amount to earn. The answer is simple... the person that contributes a lot to society deserves to be rich. How much do they deserve to earn? Let the free market decide. In a market where no one is lying or coercing, everyone earns what they deserve.
The only way BitCoin can go to $1m per BitCoin, is if the whole world embarrasses it, either as a 1 world currency, or as a means of transmitting money. If one person brought this much value to the world, then in my book, they deserve to be a Trillionaire! Good luck to him I say. If you put the top 50 or so richest people together, they would probably have a trillion dollars, and I don't think think all 50 combined would have contributed as much to the world as Satoshi (assuming BitCoin goes where we all hope it's going)
