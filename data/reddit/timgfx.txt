That value isn’t worth 20$ of transaction fees, I also don’t think btc is that decentralized as there is only 1 dev team working on it. Most alts have multiple of them

You’d be a wonderful politician. You remind me of someone
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:53:46
I don’t think that many alts will go for 20$ fees

If you don’t have any valid arguments then you might have to rethink your opinion. Otherwise post them so people know what you’re talking about
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:18:17
Mind elaborating why? If you have some valid arguments I would be more than happy to agree with you

Time to try Bitcoin Cash :P

It should go low so investing will be cheaper, then spike up
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:35:40
I know, which is why I'm wondering why you're saying that this sub doesn't ban people for disagreeing while it looks very like it's very true
@_date: 2016-10-21 19:15:47
No, I'm making a Steam BTC Bot. All I'm doing is managing the transactions etc myself so I can't get any trouble with other wallet websites.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:40:41
Okay I think I get it now. Basically I should look at all unspent transactions, and look at the closest one to what I'm sending, then send that amount - the miners fee?
@_date: 2016-10-20 16:28:53
Uhh I have no idea how I would set that up. I don't even know if I am using my own node, all I do is generate transactions themself, I push them to all nodes using BlockChain.info
@_date: 2016-10-23 05:57:41
Javascript(Nodejs). I've already figured it out lol. Spent the whole day yesterday to basically finish the whole bot (but then buying from it, which is easier to make)
@_date: 2016-10-21 16:45:55
Yeah I know. That's all done with code
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:27:23
Oooh, so all BTC wallet servers form a global network that all contain the same data, and if the wallet server of someone you're sending money too, my wallet server and his wallet server have to contain the same balance data of the both of us to perform a transaction, correct? And afterwards the updated data will be shared through other wallet servers?  So if I were to start my own wallet website I could give myself infinite BTC and trade them for real life things with users of my wallet server? (For educational purposes :p)
@_date: 2016-10-18 19:01:56
Alright, I've tried it and am able to generate BTC addresses and get their private key. I'm searching for a nice looking one now :P To broadcast to the blockchain I would use something like  right? 
@_date: 2016-10-20 14:14:50
I don't get what an input is then, could you explain?
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:40:42
Okay so if I were to create my own BTC server what would be its limitation or differences to other servers
@_date: 2016-10-18 19:08:21
Thanks a lot! This will help me tons :)
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:38:37
Ah I get it now! So a transaction with 2 outputs and 1 input would be when I sent 2 BTC to someone and get the remainder from the 10 I got in another transaction back (and leave an amount as miner fee). How do I select 2 outputs then? So I can send 2BTC to someone and 9.8 to me? I think because I didn't declare this, it just gave the remainder to the miners! 
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:37:36
I see, so if the transaction is older it will get a higher priority? Then how can I decide the fee taken? In the transactions I've made it just took the remaining BTC balance. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 21:00:01
Ill watch it tomorrow. Thanks for the help so far! :)
@_date: 2016-10-20 14:56:49
Ah okay, so multiple inputs are just multiple addresses sending BTC to another address. I don't think I will use that then :p. Thanks
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:53:55
Interesting. But how do you make all ledgers update? There must be a central server then right? Also, if you use a wallet website they're the ones receiving the ledgers right, and if you have your own wallet you're the one receiving the ledgers. If so how would I go about continuously updating the ledgers?
@_date: 2016-10-18 20:14:06
One last question. If I use the Blockchain.info API to broadcast my transactions I do not have to open a wallet at Blockchain correct? I am managing it myself right, and with a Blockchain wallet they manage it?
@_date: 2016-10-18 18:00:54
Alright. I've watched it and get how Bitcoin works, now I'm wondering if this allows me to create my own bitcoin wallet server, with my own ledger files.  Can you confirm? Thanks :P
@_date: 2016-10-17 19:31:34
I see. But wouldn't you be able to give yourself as many BTC as you want then? I don't get it x)
@_date: 2016-10-20 14:59:19
Ah alright. But the problem is that I don't know how to set the fee :/ it's automatically done by blockchain or BitcoinJS
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:10:37
Okay, and there you can enter it yourself?
@_date: 2016-10-23 17:36:32
I've heard of bitcore but never used it. I use bitcoinjs-lib and Blockchain.info's api :)
@_date: 2016-10-21 09:39:51
But I am not using a wallet, I have my own server for that, but I already found out :D. Thanks man!
@_date: 2016-10-23 18:59:11
Ah okay. So you wouldn't have to submit transactions through for example blockchain.info?
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:51:16
I am not using anything to manage my wallet. It's on my own server. I use BlockChain to send transactions, so I think they decide the fee. But I think a 25 cent fee on less than 1 cent is a bit extreme. 
I'll check the code on how it submits the transaction later so I can check if it's decided there
@_date: 2016-10-21 20:44:03
Yeah I went kinda off topic in the comments xD
@_date: 2016-10-24 13:23:15
Multiple addresses.....
@_date: 2016-10-20 14:01:38
Okay. Do you know how to do it? Their nodejs module only allows me to submit transactions, or is the fee included in the transaction already? 
If it is I would have to take a look at the module I use to create transactions. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 12:39:39
One more question. What would be the best way to pay people using a bot? What my idea is, is making a transaction with 2 outputs. One is the user I'm paying with the amount of BTC they should get, then an output is the bot, so the same as the input, with the rest of the bots balance - a miners fee. Do you think this is a good way of doing this? Or should I look at my previous transactions and send an amount of a transaction that hasn't been spent yet, instead of my total balance? I thought total balance would be handy since I wouldn't have to do that then, what are your thoughts about this?
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:39:34
Yep! Great explanation :)
