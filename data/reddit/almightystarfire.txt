You're an idiot.
Yes, the tax disparity between classes is unfair and needs changing.
No, taxes are not theft. Taxes are the crux of every successful economic system. How do you expect a country to run without taxes? Let's all stop paying taxes because we're pissy little bitches and watch our countries collapse.
I have no issue with some minor tax evasion on a side venture like BTC mining purely because the rich dodge tax therefore it's 'fair'. What I do take issue with is the principle of "taxes are bullshit why should I contribute to society even though i have the means and then some?"

"Hey, these are fake!"
*scary face* "...and? What you gonna do, huh?"
"Well i err... hadn't thought that far. I'll call the police!"
"Yeah, I expected as much when I decided to rob you. Good luck with that."

Don't be a fucking retard all your life.

Speaking from experience: criminals - especially thieves and especially *professionals* - tend to prefer avoiding physical confrontation because it's messy and a beaten body is a plethora of evidence. Most guys like this would rather rip you off and be gone before you notice.
Only an idiot or a *genuine* psychopath will beat on you just for the fun of it when they could've just taken the resources and legged it.

Traps who like men are gay, yeah.

Male being attracted to another male __*who looks like a female*__ (if it looks like a man in a dress there's no trap) hence the first male isn't actually attracted to a male.

It's only irrelevant if you can't see the relevance.

*My* comment is relevant because it's a philosophical statement that could be apllied to just about any thread where the word "irrelevant" comes up.

...because then they wouldn't be able to loan out/use/create tokens for more than they have and the entire exercise would be moot.
