Since it was removed, here's the OP text for anyone who finds this thread later.
"Hello, I am a 7 year old girl and I would like to draw something for you. I will draw anything (as long as my Dad who is helping me is ok with it). If you like my drawing, I accept Bitcoin tips which I will use to buy an easel.
To start, here is a picture I drew today of an octopus making a selfie: 
Thank you!
Edit: Dad here, here's a pic of the artist in action for the skeptics  Thanks to everyone for making drawing more exciting than usual for her. Now she's out like a light. Thanks again.
Edi 2: Upon seeing the response this morning she's done a couple more pictures and says: Sweet!"
Also since this thread was a lot of fun for her and for us as parents, we created a tumblr at  where we'll post further work if it is requested via tumblr.

Dangerous picture. This kind of makes me scared even though it's my own picture.

Dad here. Just to follow up, it looks like this post was removed after being up for about 16 hours. We've decided not to raise it as an issue with the r/bitcoin mods but it was a great experience and my daughter already wanted to do it some more.
More than the money she really responded to the attention this thread brought by focusing a lot more on her drawings than ever before. To archive it and keep the door open, I created a tumblr for her ( and will be on the look out for other opportunities for her to do this again. If you know of any places where kids can share their work with other kids (at this age always with their parents as a proxy), please share and I'll do the same.
