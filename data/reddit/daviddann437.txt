I don't know, many altcoiners aren't going to recover

The weekend is when they play with the price, I wouldn't look at the chart until atleast Tuesday.

I used to do this until the dip kept dipping then I got suicidal and had to be checked into a mental ward for 5 months...
@_date: 2019-07-19 11:04:37
Except those that are buying the dip that keeps dipping.. what about the bitcoin alts that think its the real bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:37:42
blind speculation, I wonder how many dream of bitcoin reaching $10,000 probably those that brought in at $1,000
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:58:34
there are other coins which are cheap and have the potential to rise, dont' go chasing gains
@_date: 2017-03-30 23:30:14
Well it could reach a $1,000,000 if 21,000,000 millionaires each had one...

Doesn't matter ~~had sex~~ makes sense.

It's the prudent that end up suffering when the reckless default and the gov bails out their bad debt while prices increase.

hold me, I need someone like you to guide me through this space.
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:05:38
But my lambooooo
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:13:53
Wait what year is this? 2017 again?
@_date: 2018-06-18 12:17:38

It's over the experiment failed.

Some of them deserve it, shilling their shit bags and taking money from ponzi payouts. They should've banned those bitconnect tards long time ago.
@_date: 2019-12-25 07:42:07
It can't be left to the free market and they know because they police out human trafficking and the likes of Alex Jones. Yet they leave the shitbags shilling their get rich quick ponzi and scams, VPN's, gambling.

you'll never get any btc more like EAc
@_date: 2019-09-20 08:46:56
Fuck EA pieces of scum worse than ICO's with the scams they pull on in video games
@_date: 2016-10-01 01:56:50
are there any bitcoin miners in spain?
@_date: 2016-10-01 04:03:45
Perhaps they had to come up with novel ideas to balance the budge and estimate they could raise millions by taxing bitcoin miners
@_date: 2016-10-24 13:58:06
Nice self plug there Trevor Martin. Still after that candy ?

I don't know why anyone would want to complete against the Chinese and their electricity subsidiaries.

get everything off the exchanges, I'm being serious there could be a run on several of these exchanges and lack of liquidity could cause a panic and anyone of them could be insolvent. 2013 bubble ended when mtgox went under... so be careful.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:05:48
you could always give me the BCC's if you don't want them...
@_date: 2016-07-29 05:36:02
What if coinbase create their own HF to get back the ETC... what a paradox.
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:33:32
What if ETC becomes the strong chain?
