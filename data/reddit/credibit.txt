I think you've adopted a pretty uncharitable of Wladimir's comments. He doesn't want 100% consensus, he wants general agreement in the technical community. The issue is that Gavin has managed very effectively to rally non-developers but has had very limited success in convincing the people who understand Bitcoin best. Wladimir is right to be cautious in those circumstances.

I think this calculation is misguided. The bitcoin exchange rate is a variable in the calculus of the miners, true, but it's also a variable in the calculus of any attackers. If bitcoin becomes substantially more valuable but the attack difficulty stays the same bitcoin is less secure.

Businesses have physical assets which are not subject to counterparty risk. Bitcoin is entirely dependent on a community consensus that it is valuable, which means that its value is extremely volatile.

The 14th amendment establishes the right to privacy through the due process clause. Abortion is an aspect of the right to privacy. 
I don't have time to review the constitutional jurisprudence but the 14 -&gt; privacy argument is reasonably compelling unless you to take a strict originalism approach. It's also worth noting that if you don't believe it works for abortion you have to be prepared to acknowledge that it doesn't establish a right to privacy for other things.

Firstly, those fines are almost always the result of settlements, so nothing was actually proven.
More importantly though, its far more difficult to obtain a conviction in a criminal trial. Civil trials are judged on the balance of probabilities while a criminal conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In a criminal trial a specific individual needs to face time in prison, which requires the prosecution that that specific individual performed the illegal act and had the requisite criminal intention. Civil trials, by contrast, generally only require proof that the illegal act was performed.

The advantage of using the blockchain is that it is far too slow for high-frequency trading. The downside is that this 'bug' is likely going to prevent its adoption.

This is something only someone whose taken Econ 101 but NOT anything higher would say. There is plenty of 'waste' which is not realized as profit or loss. Emissions are a good example of one such externality. 
Edit: I didn't even realize that I was responding to Vorhees but this is certainly consistent with his general lack of understanding.

Because they are potential sellers. There is a point where even the most committed hoarder will need to recoup some of his losses. The potential that these sellers will begin offloading their bitcoin makes the traders nervous, and the price volatile.

I don't think you understand how PseudoNode works. The creator would be the better person to comment but my understanding is that, because PseudoNode doesn't store any data, it would need to request the information from the nodes which are storing it.

Business owners talk to each other. If their friend down the block has had a good experience with accepting bitcoin, they'll be interested. If they've had a bad experience with accepting bitcoin, they'll be turned off.

In order to 'hide' full nodes against DDoS it is necessary to have a high number of fake nodes relative to the real nodes. However, at this point, since even the fake nodes believe other fake nodes are real any request will take far longer because it will have to be passed from fake node to fake node to fake node before it finally hits a real node.
