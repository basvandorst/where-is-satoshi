Maybe you should diversify your portfolio more. I did it and I'm seeing good profits right now compared to when I would have everything in BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:16:32
Look on  
Don't put the fee where the bar is very long. Something slightly above those high bars is totally fine. That's what I'm always doing and it always worked (on average takes about 2 hours for me).  
You can actually ignore the warning because with nearly every wallet right now, their fee estimation algorithms are not reliable.

What do you mean with Auth? As in Google Authenticator / SMS etc.?  
If so, you can turn that off if you want.

If you really have access to free electricity, then yes. It can be even more profitable to rather mine an altcoin instead of BTC.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:51:31
In my opinion, you can forget about any future BTC forks, jsut a waste of time and only rewarding for those who created the "fork coin".  
To answer your question, no it does not make any difference if you store your BTC on legacy or segwit address. Just make sure you store it in a wallet where you have control of the private keys.

I don't know which exchange you are using. I can recommend you Binance though. You can deactivate 2FA (Auth) if you want to as far as I can see.  
Note: It is **not** recommended to deactivate 2FA though. Too much security risk. Just saying.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:53:01
  
Here you can see the Segwit adoption as a graph.  
And the amount of transactions has nothing to do with Segwit. Just more people doing more transactions than normal I guess?
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:57:31
Bitcoin addresses don't have to necessarily start with a "1". In case they already implemented "Segwit" for example, they can start with a "3" too.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:16:39
Care to elaborate? What do you mean with "none will work"? I never used Poloniex exchange before but I assume it's like every other exchange. For each coin, there is one fixed deposit address, right?  
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:11:35


No, you don't need to verify an ID with Binance. Unverified accounts can withdraw 2 BTC per 24h, verified accounts 50 BTC per 24h. That's the only difference when it comes to verification.  
Binance is quite safe, it's one of popular exchanges around here. Personally, I can totally recommend them.  


Yep, nothing to say against Electrum but I read from many comments here that Electrum is not really "noob-friendly". Might be difficult to use for someone who never touched Cryptocurrency before.


Send the BTC to an exchange which supports BTC/USD pairing. For just turning BTC to real cash ("fiat"), GDAX would be totally fine.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:08:30

well ust show us the transactions ID's so we can have a look on them. My transactions went through in couple of hours the last few days.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:09:03
if your BCH is in GDAX, there is nothing you can do right now because GDAX/Coinbase paused all BCH buy/sell orders. I guess you to wait until it's open again.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:39:33
bc1 addresses are considered as "native Segwit" and the 3... addresses are just a "light version" of Segwit, a transition phase if you want. So it's not bad to include both.  


Not really I think. It's much more important from what address the sending person is sending.  
This post exlains it quite well: 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:21:10
I assumed by their post that they support withdrawal **from** p2wsh addresses. That would be already sufficient. Segwit deposit addresses don't make a difference if you are not sending from segwit address.

According to their website, they do **not** support segwit yet. It's not even in development.

"Planned = It's on our radar but we have not actively started development on it yet."
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:15:39

The probability to guess 12 random words in exact same order is really really really slim. We are talking about winning in the lottery 5 times in a row, that kind of slim.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:17:34
Segwit to non-Segwit is still a Segwit transaction and hence gets the Segwit "benefit".  
  
Sender is relevant, Destination is not that important. I hope that makes it a bit more clear.

yep as others already said, you were confusing "stop order" and "limit order".  
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:50:53


Yes, you can. However...


That's because of the bech32 addresses which as of right now, nearly no one adopted them yet. So if you want to send from traditional address to bech32 address, the bech32 address will most likely be shown as invalid address. Many wallets/exchanges just don't recognize them yet.  
I think Electrum gives you the option to also generate segwit addresses starting with "3...", use them.  


Please no. :D Start using Segwit-supoorted Wallets.

Well after a quick Google search, I found pretty nothing about it. Either it's pretty new or no one is using it, at least not in the western world.  
Anyways, if you ask me, I wouldn't use it because there are plenty other exchanges with much more reputation.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:58:31
Why do you think it would "disappear"?  
I assume you use Blockchain.info (cause "from blockchain"). If you try to send your BTC to a Segwit Address starting with a "3...", then this is totally fine. If you try to send them to a Segwit address starting with "bc1...", Blockchain.info will most likely say it's an invalid address cause they don't recognize them.  
So your BTC will not just "disappear" suddenly.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:11:01
Yea the default suggestions in many wallets are just bad, I recommend everyone to set a custom fee.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:52:16
It was the same for me. GDAX shows transfers as complete. If you check on Coinbase (same company as GDAX), I bet you see the transfer there as 'pending'.  
Give it 4-5 hours (that's how long it took for me to withdraw yesterday)

You can buy BTC at 'exchanges'.  
The most popular are Coinbase (Gdax), Bitstamp, Gemini, ... there are so many. I would recommend you Coinbase, very easy to use. Create an account at your exchange, verify your identity and deposit money via bank transfer, paypal or debit card etc. After they received your money, you can buy your Bitcoin.

Go for something you feel comfortable with. Personally, I would go with iOS or Android cause Desktop Wallet gives me an "unsafe" feeling. If your PC gets infected (much higher probability than phones) with some malware or something, it's just a matter of time before something bad happens.  
EDIT: Regarding iOS, just give any wallet a try and see if it is user-freindly for you. Electrum is quite popular, so try that one.

Use this site  , scroll down and it says what fee is used for fast transactions and what the average fee is.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:59:49

@_date: 2017-12-08 13:37:53
It's because the network is flooded with transactions right now.
At this moment, about 217.000 unconfirmed transactions.
 
Nothing you can do other than to wait.
Hopefully, Lightning Network will be implemented soon so these times of slow transactions will be over.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:51:58
I would say it depends on what price range your products are.  
Offering more payment options is good, the question is: who is gonna pay the (currently high) transfer fees?  
Customer probably does not want to pay that, neither you cause this would lower your profits.  
So if you sell low-price products (e.g. &lt;50$), then no...wait. For high-cost products, maybe yes if you can bear the trouble with the fees and the current slow transactions.

BTC addresses don't have a '-' sign in it. That's probably the "Transfer ID".  
On the top-right corner, click on "Accounts". Then you click "BTC Account". Then on the top-right corner, you click on "Transfers" (small font). Expand your latest withdraw and there you should see the "BTC transaction hash". That's the transaction ID you want to type into e.g. Blockcypher

For now, starting with a "3..." . bc1 addresses will not be recognized by major exchanges and wallets cause they are not supported yet. If Segwit gets more adopted, amount and use of bc1... addresses will rise too.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:00:12
There are two types of Segwit addresses: p2sh (start with a "3...") &amp; bech32 (start with "bc1..."). Bitstamp says that the bc1... address is invalid because not many wallets/exchanges have adopted it yet. Not even many have adopted the "light" version of Segwit (p2sh) yet, so it will take some time until we can actively use bc1... addresses.  
Just generate an segwit address starting with "3..."
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:08:56

Go to [bitaddress.org](  
At the bottom, you can find a download link for a zip archive. Download it, close your browser, clear cache &amp; cookies, disconnect from internet and open the html from the zip archive.  
Then you go from there, move your mouse to create your private/public key pair.  
After that, send a small amount (if you want to make sure it works although this will cost a lot of fees I guess, but better safe than sorry right?) to the public adress to make sure the paper wallet "works"

"we are planning to implement SegWit in 2018."
 


You have 2 options:  
1) If you really want to hold for some years, let it stay on Coinbase in order to save transaction fees. **But** the general advice is to never let your BTC in an exchange because you don't have control over your private keys. If the exchange is down, you don't have access to BTC. If the exchange gets hacked, there is a high chance that your BTC will most likely be gone.
2) You transfer your BTC to a wallet (with Segwit support if possible) where you have control over the private key, but you need to pay the transaction fee once.  
If you have much much money in BTC and want higher security, go for option 2. Otherwise option 1.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:38:20
Use Coinbase, very simple to use.  
You would need to create and verify your Coinbase account, then transfer money to them via bank transaction as you prefer. Then you head over to gdax.com, verify again, deposit money from your coinbase account (free &amp; instant), then you buy Bitcoin on GDAX (preferrably with Limit Order). From here you have two choices, let your Bitcoin sit in GDAX or transfer them to a wallet.  
This is as far as I know the way to minimize the fees as much as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:17:45
Why would you trust something which looks like a "rip-off" and has not many testimonials than something which might be the "original"?  (Why not just use GDAX in the first place? Or any other known exchange with good reputation)
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:41:32
With Segwit, you can expect to pay much less fees compared to non-Segwit transactions.

It doesn't matter if Deposit is Segwit or not. Withdrawals have to be Segwit. The sending address is the relevant factor. If you withdraw from them, they send from a Segwit address, good. If you want to deposit to them, you have to send from a segwit address.

Short answer: If you send from a Segwit address, you pay less transaction fees.  


Just choose a provider who supports segwit-enabled wallets. Take a look here:   
There are some Wallets listed which already support Segwit.

Binance, Bittrex, Gemini, blockchain.info are all major players and still not supporting Segwit yet.

Fees are very low right now (~10-15 sat/b)...we are talking about cents here. Transaction times seems also quite fast, 10-20 minutes is a good estimate as far as I have read lately. Better calculate 1 hour to be safe.  
So due to the very low fees and relatively fast transaction times, there is no need anymore to switch to a faster coin to transfer, just keep it in BTC.  
Note: You did not state your intent but if you just plan to hold your BTC long-term and rarely trading, transfer them to a wallet instead of an exchange like another user already suggested. Ignore this if you want to trade ;)

Not sure if Bittrex really lowered their withdrawal fees. If you want to save fees, then yes send the BTC directly but expect 1 hour to arrive in worst case. If your priority is speed like you want to buy some dip right now in another coin, do the workaround with e.g. DGB like you mentioned. You have to decide between highest speed vs. maximum saving of fees.

Even if Coinbase rolls out Segwit next week sometime, it still won't work with "Segwit Electrum". If you choose Segwit in electrum, it gives you a bech32 address (someone correct me if I'm wrong). However, nearly none exchange supports bech32 yet so if you try to send from GDAX to your "Segwit Electrum" (bech32 address), it will simply say that it is a invalid address.  
So yes, choose "Standard" for now.

It's because bc1 addresses are widely still not supported yet. This should change in the upcoming weeks though with the release of the recent Bitcoin Core Client.  
But for now, you need to use a "non-bc1" address.  Check in Electrum if there is a way to create a segwit address starting with a "3...."

The text says 0.2% fees but the image shows 2% somehow

I don't use Ledger but I assume that your Ledger segwit address starts with "3...." right?
If you create a segwit address in Electrum, it starts with "bc1....". There are two types of segwit addresses where the bc1... ones are considered to be "full-segwit". The "3..." addresses are widely used and compatible everywhere where the bc1... addresses are not supported almost anywhere yet.

"We are excited about the advances SegWit offers and we plan to begin making it available within our wallets in as soon as possible in 2018, with an eye towards rollout in Q1."
