Cryptsy has had the hallmarks of insolvency for months. If they've been hacked or otherwise lost user deposits, and have become insolvent, and lied about it by not revealing that information, all the while taking more deposits to pay for other users' withdrawals, it's a giant scam. If this is the case, I hope criminal prosecutions follow.

Running an insolvent exchange and accepting deposits to pay for other users' withdrawals, without telling anyone, is a scam. If this is what Cryptsy is doing, they are scammers.

They could set up their own distributed proof of stake multi-bank blockchain, with each bank holding huge chunks of the network's "coins" as off-limits reserves (to prevent centralized double spends). The remainder would be spendable and would constitute the value for the network's transactions. 
They'd undoubtedly want to form a private network, with a private consortium developing it. No fucking way banks will treat the Bitcoin blockchain as anything but a tradeable/manipulable commodity when it's outside of their control.

Bitcointalk needs improvement, the trust system is broken because of things like this, and the forums are filled with useless shitpost filler because of people getting paid for postcount from these signature campaigns.

If F2Pool abandoned NYA, why is it still being signaled in their blocks?
Though [the current numbers]( are roughly the same, a 6-month hashrate share % doesn't hold much meaning too btw. It'll be the hashrate present on the pools running this or that software for the potential hard fork period.
Edit: The latest tweet on this account says the pool will stop signaling NYA whenever they restart their pool server.  However that would still leave about an 85% supermajority of hashing power signaling NYA.

Miners have the most control of consensus in Bitcoin. According to  94.4% of blocks mined in the last 24 hours signal "NYA" or Segwit2X support.

Yet another way using an ad blocker keeps you safe. If internet advertisement companies were responsible, and actually had a human look at their ads to make sure they don't have malware or other scam attempts, I would be fine with limited advertising on the web. This is not the reality obviously, so I exercise my right to not run their irresponsibly unreviewed code on my computer.

I don't think MaxCoin made Max any money. No premine, and the people that made the most on it were Nvidia miners who had ported the CPUminer code to Cudaminer in the first day or so. It was pretty much an ego thing for Max.

That's heavy speculation. Mt. Gox was having severe withdrawal "issues" before January 28th when the bot started selling rather than buying. Suspicion "on the street" was Mt. Gox had become bitcoin insolvent sometime in the middle of January. Although there was more evidence that they were currency insolvent, it's possible the bot owner(s) were trying to bail out via currency.
