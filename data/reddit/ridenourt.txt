I would sell right now if I were you. 
The biggest tip off is "I'm young and have my life savings in btc right now". Never throw money into something like this that you don't plan to lose. Plain and simple.
Sell sell and sell. Once you have disposable income and you can afford to lose than invest and NEVER place all your eggs in one basket.

"They" are what we refer to as the MM's or the market makers. They push billions with algorithmic trading, media control, and other avenues. 
I do agree on a point above that this would be way further down the road. 
On another point "You can't have bitcoin go mainstream while at the same time keep it isolated from larger financial markets. They are part in parcel."
Bitcoin has done a great job without wall street so far. They will be fine without them in the future.

After reading a lot of responses on this board for this last hour there is a ton of weak hands that will get feared out of their positions. Too much hope that it rises to the moon.
Besides that though looking at the chart 1090-1100 looks like a good entry if you want to gamble on the ETF decision. 
If it fails and this is just MY Guess. We hit 890-920 range. We bounce off that and it heads to 970-990 range. From there we start the next leg down from Lower highs/ Lower lows.
If it passes and this is just my guess. We go higher with quick shot. maybe we fill the third wave in the elliot wave theory. However it really feels like another buy the rumor sell the news feeling in my gut 
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:43:30
I would be a little careful here. At 1000 it is hitting the top of the downward channel. It would actually be a good short if I was shorting it. This is just the trader in me and everyone should be hodling and not watch the short term moves. I would short at 1000 or that area and my stop loss would go in at 1017
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:41:52
I really like that there is NOT going to be a ETF. We will be back at 1300 in a little bit. It might take a few weeks or even a few months but we will be back. 
Wall Street would manipulate this so much. Just look at the volume of silver and gold on the CME. They trade more silver in one day then they produce in a given year. How is that even possible ? Gold is almost the same way 
Look at the options for Jan 18 2018 GLD
They don't produce anywhere near that many tons of gold.
Bitcoin would have been the same way. Just manipulate up, down and sideways and the house always wins minus Hodlers)

I just sold 1/2 my ethereum today at 49.25. I ike both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin has a cloudy few months with all the core/Bu back and forth, however Ethereum rocket fuel is about to run out as well. I think the drop in Bitcoin can be attributed to Ethereum getting hot.

This is the one area I have hope in. The finite supply of bitcoin itself ( 16+ million) right now going to 21 million by 2100, however what is the rules on exchanges regarding shorting. is there any way to get the short percentage  or outstanding coins shorted? For example lets say Bitcoin goes to $2000 USD. A big player has a account on a exchange in Japan funded with 250 million. The ETF is trading at 200. he comes in and buys 30K contract of the 190 PUTS. he turn around and shorts 500 million in bitcoin. Causes a panic and drops bitcoin to 1100 or 110 on the ETF. Then picks up contracts for $8000 a contract. In turn buys bicoin on other exchanges and another 30-60K contract Calls. Start covering his shorted Bitcoin while also buying in other exchanges ring it to $2500. Rince and repeat over and over

I wish I had tenant like this. I have 3 rentals and 7 I watch for my parents. Out of those 10 about 6 are good to go every month with no issues. 2 of them have been a revolving door of hoarders, people that just did not care ect. I never had anyone pay upfront for a year though... The last 2 are really starting to go decent now as well. 
I am planning on retiring at 44 and have been investing since I was 11. My best investments were QCOM early. AAPL in the 60's pre-split. MA right after they IPO'd and ISRG in the teens. Last year I did great with NVDA and still own percentages of all above except AAPL . 
I agree timing the marked is very difficult, however I play it a little different and go by the trend. The trend in Bitcoin is broken and lower highs and lower lows right now. I am still Hodling strong, but want to pick up a lot more. When I threw in 4% of portfolion in 2015 to crypto I ended up taking off the table at certain points. On bitcoin it was buying at 350-400 and selling at 840, 920, 1215. Now I only have 25% of what I first bought, but I have a great gain. With Ethereum bought a lot 8 range and unloaded in high 30's and high 40's. Still have some but nowhere near what I started out. If either falls heavy I will grab some for the long term. 
so again let me say this. averaging out is great if the underlining investment does great, but what happens if you dump a heavy part of you core position when the trend changes.

See the thing is they don't have enough silver to sell to begin with. So they make up a paper price and sell silver as much as they like to manipulate the price. Each contract is for 5000 ounces. The open interest on the CME right now until Jan 2018 is 3.8 billion ounces short. Everyone is naive if they don't think they an manipulate Bitcoin jut because there is a certain number of coins. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:58:56
I would stay clear until it drops to a support and holds it for a long period of time. Let it bottom out on it's own and once it stabilizes then jump in. We might be days, weeks, or months away from that point.

In addition Wall Street is the BEST and I mean the FUCKING BEST and instilling FEAR or FOMO. If the ETF get approved they will jerk you left to right on a weekly basis. The Hodlers will win at the end though as long as they don't check short term price and listen to the talking heads. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:16:03
I am hodling with what is left. Sold most before this drop, and even early at 1215 before it hit the 1300 range. I want to pick up cheap coins and when you fear the most it usually signals a good time to buy. Unfortunately there are still way to many weak hands that will need to get flushed. Then what is going to happen, in this civil war that is really heating up. If they hard fork split then both sides will be dumping huge amount of coins. If that happens then give it some time and pick up cheap coins. 
If you buy now the chances of huge upside are limited. If they come to a agreement I would definitely buy. The view is better on the sideline right now 
Chart wise this is really breaking down. The long term bull run from Oct 2015 looks to be broken. There is strong support at the 880 level and again 820 level, however it seems to be lower highs and lower lows (sign of the bear). 
@_date: 2017-03-12 04:23:37
I have been investing for a long time and I like to think that others are in my same boat. Short term I could care less and really this is a hedge against the dollar for me. 
I bought a lot of gold and silver Jan - March 2016 and then in April I picked up my first 20 Bitcoin. I ended up selling 12 when it more than doubled so I ended up with free coins. 
Anyway the reason for the buying of bitcoin, silver, and gold is the inevitable collapse in currencies. The Euro is really on shaky ground right now. If Germany or France pull out the Euro is going to get crushed. Then on the other side you have the US in 20 trillion in debt. Those chickens will come home to roost at some point in the next 10 years.

This +1. I bought GOOG right after the IPO at 115 and held for a little while. When it IPO'd it was valued at 51 billion and they only had 400 million in sales a year. They didn't know at the time how Google would monetize search so a lot of people said no way. On the outside it looked like another dotcom stock that was useful, but couldn't make money. When they tried to monetize search a lot of companies balked at paying Google for clicks. 
Obviously a lot has changed in 14 years as Google hangs out raking in the money at a alarming rate.

I think you can throw away all the stock charts on this one. There is just two many apples to oranges scenarios to trade it like a stock. Also politics definitely come into play as far as China goes.

I bought silver at JM Bullion last January. I mined bitcoin back when it was around 1-3, but could never use it. 
Also I remember there was a website you signed up for and you received 10 bitcoin. Anyway back in the day I used slickdeals.net a lot so when I worked nights I would buy a bunch of crap from everywhere ( Dell, HP, Cisco on and on ) and sell it on e-bay. Anyway one day a offer came along and you get 10 free bitcoin for opening a account. All that was required at the time was a email address ect. So over the course of three nights I did like 25 accounts for 250 bitcoin. A month or so later my hard drive crashed. I replaced the hard drive and threw out the old one. I didn't keep the seed or anything. Later on when bitcoin soared to 25 I was searching everywhere because wasn't sure I threw it out or not. Anyway it was done ...
Does anyone remember the site that gave 10 free bitcoin ??

First rule of investing or buying is only throw in what you can afford to lose. If you don't think bitcoin is speculative than you are already in the wrong area. 
I believe we are close to a short term bottom, however this is nothing like equities (stocks)  where I have 28 years of experience. There is glaring differences. 
Bitcoin trades 24/7 so it can be manipulated easily on light volume. Once it gets manipulated heavy in one direction it can definitely cause a cascading effect down or a rocket going to the upside. 
The reason I believe this is a good range to buy is because at this price point is where it took off. So before the rocket up people were happily paying 790-800. I consider it almost like a base of some sort and that is exactly what bitcoin needs to start building right here. 
A Lot of people believe this will be a major currency or medium of exchange in the future. They also believe that fiat currencies will collapse over time or that the printing of money will make them worthless as the paper they are printed on. I call these people the Hodlers and at some point they are going to be right UNLESS. Unless bitcoin gets hacked. Unless China and other countries clamp down hard on this. Unless another medium that is better does not come along. There is some scenarios that can derail bitcoin. What I believe is the technology and underlining fundamentals are spot on. This is a medium of exchange that governments can't control. There is a limited amount of 16 million right now that will increase to 21 million over the next 123 years. 
What is also taking off is you are actually able to use this in your daily life. So you can turn this in and actually buy something of value ie food, silver ect. Since it is the first digital currency and a limited number available the price should increase exponentially over the years and it will. 
So buying at 800 is not a bad idea.I personally like my chances here, but I also bought a lot lower and unloaded some at $1040

I have watched it .... quick story I started shorting KBH, NVR, Toll Brothers and the entire sector. I got my ass handed to me when I initiated my short in NOV 2006. It wasn't until Feb 09 did I come out ahead on my shorts and some positions just annihilated. Still made out ahead, but if I waited 14-16 more months I would have made out HUGE. Patience is key when it comes to investing

If this scenario plays out it would be catastrophic. The wild card here is Trump/Yellen and how they play the debt ceiling. They will have to push the can down the road again and that is the way it will play out, however we are already the point of no return with 21 trillion in debt. 
I really believe we will get in the 30-40 Trillion range before the world starts cutting the US off, however like I said Trump is a big wild card here. His administration is a mess and he is unable to do anything. He might try to tank it ...
If this scenario plays out we could also look at the dollar going down heavy instead of up. If people lose hope on the US dollar and change currencies pegs we could look at a Germany early 1930's to see the effect. 
Either way in both scenarios everything crashes except precious metals and bitcoin. At the start both might even come under heavy selling pressure as people need to unload to pay off bills ect. Other people will probably try to head to both as a safe haven asset. Real Estate will be killed to start, however will recover yet again.
If I was in charge I would do it completely different. I would make the Fed a government entity and turn around and monitize (or eliminate) all the US debt they carry on paper about 12 trillion. Then I would be left with about 8.5 trillion of money owed to people and governments and would honor that debt. Then I would take the 4.8 trillion that they have and use it flush the system with heavy liquidity causing even more inflation. This would draw out over years though. Then I would balance the budget and the US would be good for another whatever years, but that is me and will not play out that way.

Hey I have a ton of silver as well. Bought a lot of Eagles when it was trading around $4.50-$5.00. Sold many rolls at  $35-40. per eagle, however missed the 2011 top by a few days. Silver is still a great investment and one day will go back to $30-$50 range. 
Its not a bad investment. The 3rd largest silver mine is shut down and the top 10 silver mines in the world are getting less and less production. In addition the demand for Silver has outpaced production for 2 straight years. Lastly there is 4 billion ounces of silver short on the paper market.
I have been investing for 29 years  and have owned bitcoin not only close to the beginning but also Lightcoin at 4, an Ethereum from the 10 range.  
On stocks I own a lot of NVDA, V, MA, and ISRG. Bought NVDA at 33 range and I have been in ISRG since the 20's. With MA or Mastercard I have bought at the lowest possible price point in the history of the stock when I bought 400 shares at $40.20 pre-split. 
Give silver a chance before bagging.

I like your thoughts on it, but all along I really thought it was Hal Finney. I believe he was at the same conference at Dorian Nakamoto and really liked the name that much.

Had 8.25 BTC before this big rally. Was able to get rid of 4.25 at $1044 per BTC. All it is doing is pushing out the weak hands and creating a perfect time to buy. Time to buy is when fear is the strongest !! Just picked up 2.5 at $811
Also on a side note. If you are investing or trading in anything at all, and it has gone up this high it is time to take some gains. I know a lot of people on here are hodling until the end which is fine, but if you take some gains  each time it sky rockets like this you will be a better investor in the long run 
I will give you a example. In November I bought ATW ( Atwood Oceanics ) at 7.50 for 500 shares ($3750). I sold 150 shares at 11.65 ($1747) even though I knew it had great fundamentals. When it hit 14 ($2100) I sold another 150. Now I have 200 shares long that I just let ride instead of worrying about the roller coaster ride. What I am trying to get at is if you are in the mind set of taking some off the table each time a investment goes up, you will become a better investor in the long run.

Just by adding a ETF it will not create stability in the price. The volume will definitely increase and the price should also increase heavy in the first two months, however adding more volume could also fuel the fire even more. Look at this downdraft for example. You had people dumping Bitcoin from $1150 and if you have a ETF dumping at the same time with heavy volume your volatility should increase. With a ETF you could reach capitulation quicker though

As someone that heavily traded tech during the bubble and was even up 1.8 million at one point it is very close to the same. There are some differences though like the sheer amount of companies that would go public and automatically be worth 10-20 billion. Take your entire statement and switch crypto and internet around. Look around though as a select few not only made it out of the bubble, but also thrived. Look at the ICO's coming out now and starting off at 300 million. We are not at the point of a full fledged bubble, but we are getting there. 
In addition the bubble lasted a good 3+ years/ We are in like the 3rd inning of the bubble. Once you see ICO's pop out at a billion then you need to start worrying. Plus the top companies from that last bubble were Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, Qualcomm, and Amazon with a market cap at the time of 2.4 trillion. All of those survived and some have prospered. For everyone that prospered there is 9 that have gone belly up.

Depends on what happens after segwit. If after a while the mempool is still hosed up then yes. the first places to get the LN should be exchanges and so forth. If we are at or under 80% and transaction go back to a reasonable level then just let it be. If segwit activates and it takes months/year to get all the LN networks set up while we suffer long delays and higher costs then go for 2X. All I want is a smooth running bitcoin with low transaction costs and speed. So whatever it takes to get there.

I am a VERY cheap person. I used to take the $500-$600 offers from Ameritrade and Schwab ect to place money in my account and free trades for like 2 months. After the two months is up then I would call and get more free trades. It felt like I was constantly switching account ect after 1 year. It felt like your internet bill with whatever company was $29 then they moved it to $69 after 1 year. I closed most down except for 2 for when I want to short or derivatives.

Debt Jubilees is just the cancellation of other countries small debt. Think tiny African nations. This is 22 trillion with the fed only holding 4-5 trillion. Most of it is in house owned by Americans and institutions.

I always thought it was Hal Finney. There were four big giveaways on it being Hal. 
The first was when Satoshi was e-mailing people back at the very beginning the writing styles compared to Hal were very similar. From the way he started and ended sentences to the word structure. 
The second is Hal had the first transaction ever on Bitcoin. He was testing his own POW system. Look at all the coins he mined in the first few months. He even sold some to pay for treatment later. The main Satoshi address's haven't moved any coin because Hal died. 
Third would be when silk road went down and there was article after article about Bitcoin/drugs/murder for hire/ and the FBI wanted to interview Satoshi. They went to Hal's house and the FBI stopped looking for Satoshi, because it was Hal. The FBI wanted to back door into bitcoin, but it was useless and Hal was almost dead due to ALS. There were multiple articles looking for Satoshi after silk road was busted and they all stopped after interviewing Hal. The FBI never gives up and the media coverage at that time was everywhere then just stops. 
Lastly Hal Finney at some point met Satoshi Nakamoto in his own town (they lived close). Maybe coffee, conference or whatever and liked the name so much it turned into his pen name.

" It's all to prevent bitcoin from becoming a world reserve currency and shows he is backed by PBoC and other Rothschild central banks"
There are bigger forces at work here. In 2011-2013 Bitcoin was just a outside blip on the radar. Now it is getting bigger and being used more and more. All the major central banks still see it as a pest, however if they don't do more then it could get out of control. I don't like pushing conspiracy theories, but if you were the FED or China central bank ect why would you not crush this fly in the early stages or control it. If Segwit activates you can be completely anonymous in every transaction. If it expands far enough you can be your own bank. Control the money, and you control the population. 
Also look how much this has grown in only 9 years. Why do you think Mastercard and Visa have hired a combined 13 lobbyist against it. I have thought for a while that Jihan is only just a puppet for the PBOC.
Just think what happens if Bitcoin ever gets a market cap of 50-100-200-500 billion. Imagine the FUD and governments trying to shut it down. I bet China would do a outright ban on Bitcoin, because it would be out of there control at that point. I believe it is already past the point of control. At this point you can throw everything at it plus the kitching sink, and it will just keep coming back stronger and stronger.

I see all the comments and pictured something completely different. I believe if Litecoin and Bitcoin get Segwit/LN you could inter-exchange currencies. Like say Vendor A accepts bitcoin only well you send Litecoin it gets swapped and for Bitcoin (all in one transaction) and you pay in bitcoin. Even there would be another layer or party to swap it as it would go through almost instantaneous. 
I could easily seeing this being the future

I remember when the FBI was tracking down Satoshi due to Silk Road and to see if there was any way to backdoor into Bitcoin for tracking. It was story after story then they went to Finney's house and it all ended. At the time he was at his end with ALS.
It has to be him ....

Also I wanted to add one more comment about JPM. This is the same guy who was bailed out. I realize they were ahead of the pack during the whole debacle having 100 million saved away. People really forget the run on the banks Wachovia, Washington Mutual, BofA, Chase and Wells Fargo. There were literally lines down the street to withdraw, and they limited the transaction amount for 2 weeks at most places. That 100 million they had left over would not have lasted very long with the lines of people down the street. 
Next why trust the banking cartel head. His bank pushes a fiat currency that really rules this world right now. The US GOV is 21 trillion in debt with another 1 trillion added every 8 months. LET THAT SINK IN FOR A MOMENT. Japan is 7 trillion in debt. The Euro is so dysfunctional and in debt so is just a matter of time. Every country out there has some serious fiat issues, and they all seem like a house of cards to me. 
Do you want fiat backed by a government that is 21 trillion in debt ? Yes and No. Yes to cover bills/expenses, however NO to spread investments in other avenues.
As bitcoin grows the battle between the banking cartel/ governments is just going to get stronger and stronger. If this hits 7500-10K this FUD will look minimal in comparison.

Rating's agencies would be one. They wrote credit worthiness based on how much they were getting paid. Collusion was  rampant and based solely on money being paid by the underlining issuer. the top 3 rating agencies exec's should all be in jail. 
 Entire executive teams of the top 10 banks for giving false information on balance statements, and liquidity. They lied about both at the time and defrauded investors with incorrect financials. They did this for at least 3 quarters when the crisis was starting to unfold. 
Multiple 10-Q's were amended from 2007-2009 in Bank of America,  Wells Fargo, Chase, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Fifth Third Bancorp. The biggest issues were also Fannie and Freddie who for 2 years prior were completely late filing and were off by billions on their balance sheets. From 2002-2008 they were the canary in the coal mine. Every executive should have been thrown in jail and they even testified way before the housing crisis about their mismanaged financials
lastly the auditors should have been thrown in jails as well. Credit default swaps and other very risk derivatives were listed as assets and never truly audited.

It's a great strategy. Some of these coins have doubled overnight already. 
Just like the tech stock boom there was a lot of pumping and dumping back then. I remember some stocks would be up over 100% in a week or two to only lose about 35-60% from the top. Then rinse and repeat over the course of 3 years. Almost always when a rally started on a specific stock it would not sell out ore than 60% though. Just like coins if you have a coin that is at 10 then all of the sudden at 20. Most likely it won't fall below 14 unless there is bad news.

Once they lock in it is hammer time. When AMD was at 15 CNBC was pumping out 2-3 articles a day. Intel had all these publications that were paid for adds and they used their benchmarks to compare processors. Sometimes it would show a slower processor, but only after doing this this and that. Well CNBC would publish 15-20 articles over 2 weeks explaining price too high, yada yada, and more BS. In addition some of their articles were 4-5 days old but would happen to have a new time stamp 30 minutes before the opening bell. AMD even with a huge quarter still lost 25% and whoever wrote 10s of thousands of CALLS escaped.

This is a total attack on Bitcoin. Either there is a huge short position formed and they want to cover or they want to buy in lower.  They do it on any stock they want to and they have been doing it for 20+ years. Also watch the article times on the top and they will change to regurgitate the story in a few days. They have caused some serious stock slides over the years.

I have never deleted a comment ever. I did sell 75% of my Litecoin holdings under 33 ( bought at 4) though.I also sold 45% of my Ethereum under 98 ( Bought as low as 8-10 range ). I sell portions when it moves up heavy so I can lock in profit.

This is incorrect. Their 3 largest exchanges limited bitcoin withdraws from Febuary until May. When they were finally able to withdraw bitcoin the market already started dipping. The rise up was caused by Japan and South Korea as their exchanges have really taken over. Also in Japan, and South Korea I read somewhere that 500K places now take bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:47:50
Sounds like a plan to me.. A few weeks of slow transactions and China is completely gone from the scene.I like it and sign me up. Nothing left to ban after that once miners, and exchanges are done. Japan, South Korea, US, Europe, and other countries pick up the void that was left by the China. Might be slow transactions for a while, but we will come out a lot stronger

China is has been saying the same thing for years. look at all the posts back in Jan-March. Every 5th thread was abut China banning Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized so China can't ban shit. This was a coordinated effort to drop the price on bitcoin. They hit it with a lot of 100 BTC blocks over and over. 
If you were a whale and wanted cash out for that yacht why would you dump it all at once. What you would do is slowly sell it over 12-24 hours at the 4600 price. 10 btc here and 15 btc there. Eventually you will get there. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:49:30
Uncharted territory in the 4th inning of a bull market. The easiest way to tell is when it dumps huge then you start seeing all this FUD from CNBC, Yahoo, WSJ, China and on and on. These dumps are controlled to shake the weak hands out so the money goes to the strong hands. Also another indicator is reddit and bitcointalk.org. If you see a ton of bashing coming from less than 1 month users then they are going to try to talk it down.

It has always had it peak's and valley's since the start. In 10 years when most of the bitcoin has been mined people are going to look at it in the 50-100K range. I can see it now panic in the streets as bitcoin dropped from 75k to 62K in 4 days. Que the bitcoin is dead mantra. The big FUD is still to come when we go head to head with the banking cartel. It will get ugly !!

Thought I would revisit my post from a few days ago. Got some at 3915, 3500, and again and 3250. As I watched it hit sub 3000, I thought I would pop another order in, but it quickly bounced higher. I never really thought it would go sub 3000, and I am not trying to call the bottom or time the market. All I was saying is when the FUD is heavy it is usually a great time to buy. Still early as Bitcoin seems to be holding that 4050 level. More WSJ, CNBC, Yahoo,  and even CNN articles calling it Tulip mania ect. The FUD is still strong, but Bitcoin is like the honey banger and just does not care. 
Also PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY ADVISE. I don't want anyone losing money listening to me. I do see a correlation with the price compared to FUD/FOMO. Next China will ban mining as they are going to get desperate.

No not at all. it's in a heavy bull market. They pull out all the FUD to drop it so the strong hands make even more $$$. I have been trading stocks and investing for 29 years.

That is nothing compared to the CDS's and Derivatives in the US. I know the number dropped a lot when the bubble popped on 08-09, however they have re-inflated it.

@_date: 2017-05-24 06:54:35
The one part you might be missing is lets say this rises to 4-5k and the crash brings it down to 3K or 2500.Once a bubble starts especially one with limited supply who knows where it will stop. Also this bubble is completely different from the 2013 bubble. If I were you I would dollar cost average.

Great post. I want to add one comment to it. There is not many bitcoins left. After people losing some by passwords (early days), failed hard drives (early days), hodlers and founders like Satoshi (700K). I really feel like there are only around 4-5 million coins and 15+ big exchanges. The volume alone this week shows about 4.5 million coins changed hands. Then throw in the facts that Bitfinex had 18K coins shorted a few weeks ago and this is just one exchange. There are probably 500-700K bitcoins shorted.

It's not a bubble yet. Bubbles don't just last two weeks. That is when this started going parabolic. I was in the tech bubble in 1998-2000, housing bubble 2003-2008, and commodity bubbles. Each bubble lasted months if not more and some were multiple years. This is also not a stock or a house as you only have a few million bitcoin available. Remember what they told you about houses. All the good land was built up... remember oil and peak oil .. or what about silver gold and they supplies are diminishing. 
Here you have Bitcoin where there will only be 21 million total and they still have 123 years for the other 4.7 million bitcoin. Supply is really limited to 4-5 million coins right now. I know people will say 16.3 million, but so many of those are lost and with hodlers, Satoshi ect really the supply is limited

It's almost a 6X bagger from $23. If you bought at $23 the returns on NVDA were better. That's assuming you bought bitcoin at 400 range for a 4X. NVDA is just starting another run as well. In general I don't want to be caught in to many long positions, but for NVDA I would stick my neck out. Still waiting for all of it to correct. Real Estate, Stocks, and even crypto
