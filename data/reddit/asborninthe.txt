Actually I thought his points on the minimum wage and state pensions were spot on. We can't take away the minimum wage now because it would be disastrous but we should have never had it in the first place. 
I remember the first increase (of many) of the minimum wage, every fucking thing I bought became more expensive. The same for the next time and the next. It has increased the cost of living IMO.

Bottom line is that workers wages are usually the most expensive item on their balance sheet at the end of the year. Companies need to increase their profit quarter after quarter, if you raise the minimum wage somebody has to pay for that. Companies will cannot compromise their profit margins without a massive backlash from their investors and stockholders.
It's a clusterfuck. Also, the idea that we have minimum wage that applies over all sectors is mental.

Hell, they even said that gold is in a bubble. I think it's pretty far away from where it should be because of all of metal manipulation which people have denied (now Germany is saying its worse than the LIBOR scandal). 
I think that there is fair price, if it's over priced then its a bubble. My dad built his first house for about $10,000 and now they are at least ten times that without taking into consideration land prices. 
I agree that everything is a bubble at the minute. If there is a currency reset (there is talk about this) then you will see everything return to some normalcy including Bitcoin.

I agree with Schiff that Bitcoin won't be the only crypto in the running (although you don't want to mention that in this subreddit :D). 
However he did miss the investment opportunity of a lifetime (which indecently is exactly what the gold/silver bugs are plugging). Schiff actually talks about Bitcoin as a payment method and then says that it has no 'intrinsic value' and brushes it off. The payment system in itself is really valuable especially in a world where banks and credit card companies can take you off the grid (e.g. wikileaks/Iran).
Maybe Bitcoin is overvalued right now. For we know he could be right (again) but he has about as much insight into it as anyone else. No one could have predicted Bitcoins skyrocketing value and if they did they based it on ifs, buts, candy and nuts... i.e. they guessed it.
Schiff predicted the housing bubble and the .com bubble because he could see it coming. He looks at Bitcoin as a bubble because it honestly does look similar to the .com bubble! 
Look at it this way people were making shit sites going nowhere, similar to some of the altcoins with nothing new to offer. The money was flowing in from everywhere, similar with what is happening with China atm. However after the crash killed off a lot of .com's and a shitton of people lost their money, some .com's were here to stay but the protocol survived. 
This will happen with crypto's, you could lose your money on an altcoin (like geocities during the .com crash), or even Bitcoin! For the moment though Bitcoin is the strongest because it has the infrastructure and capital behind it; however even if Bitcoin falls the protocols of Bitcoin and the blockchain will still survive.
This is the bubble I think Schiff sees coming, something similar to the .com bubble with a load of people with no idea what they are doing pumping money into things that keep going up. Cheap money still exists and China just said they are pulling out of buying American debt so that money is flowing into crypto. Altcoins will go to a few dollars and then go to zero in the maddness. Bitcoin may survive but it will lose a lot of its value in the fallout, what is its actual value? Fuck knows.
There is a chance to make out like a fucking bandit here, but your going to have to call the top well before servers begin to crash during panic selling. Will that be before or after the world realises the States ain't good for their money and has sold the gold they have been holding? Beh, it just interesting. Don't bet the farm on it though, or do.

Don't pretend that Schiff didn't make out like a bandit with buying gold before the 2001 dot-com bubble. It went up for ten years straight and recently had a pull back. Anyone can cherry pick a year and say... 'see, terrible store of value!'. Gold has history backing it.
But yeah, gold and silver are bought and sold but not really traded for actual things. Schiff makes the point that you have to change Bitcoin back to dollars, but you can't really send someone a piece of gold and ask for a pizza, you have to do the exact same thing. Trade it for fiat and use the fiat to buy something real. 
I respect Schiff for sticking to his guns, that's expected from someone who was berated every time he talked about a crash. However he is missing the point of Bitcoin as a new payment system and seems to disregard it.

sold half and put the profit into a half dozen other alt-coins. Gonna sit on those and not buy or sell anything until the dollar collapses. I believe in cryptocoins but I just don't know which one will last.

Neither did I. I'm just screwing around to be honest. I like Bill and put some money behind his advice. I'm really just gambling and having fun on coin exchanges.

check out the fourms 
It is CPU mining only. Bill Still is also going on the Kieser Report talking about it so expect a jump in interest.

You fucking scumbag. You steal someone else's work and then put your wallet address on it? You piece of shit.

Just to let ya know. I spent about threw 0.08 Bitcoin at Quark. In three days it has turned that into 0.4. That's faster than my miner works :D
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:20:33
isn't that a month?
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:53:47
Dude, why not setup r/quark? Screw the r/bitcoin community they hate competition and go around just like the other assholes calling them 'buttcoins'. It's surprising to see how much these guys flip on other coins. Competition is good this is the whole idea.
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:49:25
Well if you haven't even heard of it, how can you form any opinion on it? 'The name is shit...' wow, great insight!
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:46:52
Well, its about getting out at the right price too! Screw it, it's just 100 bucks, that's like two nights drinking.
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:41:39
Typical r/bitcoin shithead. You sound just like the guys that call Bitcoin 'buttcoin'. 
I burned my money long ago when I first decided to buy a miner from BFL. That money is gone! Will I ever get it back? Who the fuck knows? Did I need the money at the time? Nope. Same shit with Quark.

Hah, yeah buddy whatever. At least I am not so stupid to post an image with a wallet address that has nothing to do with the original artist. Not buying your excuse btw. Scumbag.
