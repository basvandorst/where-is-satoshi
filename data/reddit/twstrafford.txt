The lightning network is encouraging everyone to think in sats. The logo design game is part of that.

This is my sketchy design for a satoshi logo
The idea here is that
\-Plays with the @ logo - satoshis are the "currency of the internet"
\-S+@ = Sat
\-You can handwrite it with a single stroke, might be useful for very small businesses
\-You can put a vertical line through the s to emphasise its moneyness
\-You can rotate a lightning emoji slightly to be an s, a "lightning s" could be used as a symbol for sats or specifically for lightning network payments. I can imagine business might charge slightly different amounts for on and off chain payments in the future.

What's the greyscale premium called? The grayscale bitcoin trust is trading at 12k.
Graytie premium?

Emin Gun Sirer sure is keen to let everyone know that he was somehow inventing bitcoin before it existed. As far as I can tell Karma is essentially a copy of Hashcash. He was making copies of Hashcash in 2004 and now he's shilling scammy ICOs. Nothing changes.

This is the second attempt I've made at making this graphic, its trying to sell bitcoin as a concept to goldbugs and Austrian-sympathetic types. I think the "something they can't stop" also highlights the "free speech money" nature of bitcoin.
Hope you like it, let me know if there are mistakes or if you have any other good ideas for content. I think my next image will be something that explains the idea of bitcoin as a schelling point.
Thanks to everyone in this community.
PS the bottom will be in by May

Thinking about buying in this bear market but I am a bit concerned about the MtGox coins coming back onto the market.
I thought the coins that MtGox had left were due to be returned to investors in February, but I can't find any information about this now. Investors have applied to get their coins back, but I don't think any have received them yet.
Does anyone know what the plan is for the return of these coins?

The spelling of haff was my attempt to keep Hayek's charming accent, the quote is from a video on youtube and I transcribed it. I also used a bitcoin symbol to spell "by". The phrasing is a little strange because it is verbatim what Hayek said in his german influenced english. If there are any other typos please mention them because I want to fix them.
Honestly the comments are helpful, this is an attempt at pro-bitcoin propaganda (targeted at Mises-institute types &amp; the wider world), so first impressions (even if they are missing a joke) do count. Also successful humour shouldn't need to be explained, if it needs explaining on r/bitcoin then it will need explaining in the wider world. I'll just take those elements out and re-edit this image based on the feedback from the thread.
