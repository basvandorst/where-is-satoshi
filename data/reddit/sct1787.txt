Gemini. You can use a bank transfer to deposit 500 USD per day for free into the exchange and the fee on a ~5k purchase is about 14 USD. 
You can also wire transfer the money in. Takes less than a day. Has to come from your bank and the cost of the wire transfer is ~30USD depending on your bank. Once in the exchange, again the fee for the purchase is about 14 USD at the moment. So this option would be a total of 45USD

Novice question here, with different prices on different exchanges, what stops someone from buying at a lower price on one and sending to the other to sell at a higher price.
I understand there are purchase fees, transfer fees, and selling fees but but I would think there exists times when a profit can be squeezed out here unless I'm missing something?

Excuse me sir, I fully agree with your argument however I do not believe the contraction "there're" exists at present.

You are only considering one half of the equation. I agree with the way you set up the probability in simple terms. What you are not including in the comparison is the payout value and if it is worth it. For example flipping a coin is obviously a better percentage chance to win (1 out of 2) than rolling a die and getting the right number (1 out of 6). However, flipping a coin that pays 1:1 is not better than rolling a die that pays 10:1 since the coin breaks even and the die in would theoretical net you 5/6ths of a dollar each roll. 
((10)(1) - (1)(5))/6 = 5/6
Not only do we need values for the odds of each scenario but we need values for the potential payout or reward
