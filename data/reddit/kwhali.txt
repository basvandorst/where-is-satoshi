Was like that in 2010, were worth less than cent each iirc, then shot up to $20 each, I sold a bunch to get a new graphics card haha.... :(

That's terrific to hear :) I loathe these companies that treat talent so poorly, I'm happy that one of them got what they deserve! 
The industry is bad enough as it is these days trying to get started. Though that's more due to poor talent identification, without decent connections it's tough not getting dismissed from a pile of other candidates eager to work. Glad you're in a much better situation these days :)

Have been holding the half coin for a few years now, though I put it into a strongcoin wallet back then which I cannot seem to access or recover :/ So maybe I don't even have that now. Half a coin doesn't sound like it's much but ya'll seem to think it's a good amount still.
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:03:57


Yeah I kinda had that for about 4 months or so worth. Last job I made the employer about six figures with a project I completed solo for a client, agreements weren't kept on the condition of me achieving that among other things so I bailed. Life is a bit harder but I'd rather not be exploited like that if I can help it.
Thansks for the wisdom :)

I'm pretty much broke trying to find work being supported just enough by welfare to get by :/ it's rather tempting to cash in. Good news is I had an awesome interview the other day so hopefully that goes well and that temptation will fade, I'd be earning about it's worth from a weeks pay if I get the role.
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:27:58
I'd been working at the company for a few months prior to doing the project for potential client. The agreement I had was verbal and my mistake for trusting the buddy buddy boss, learnt my lesson the hard way ha. Will definitely have it in writing if such agreements are made with anyone in future :) 
Bigger gripes are that as it was a startup you usually get paid some incentive like shares, they were using this slicing pie model thing as an alternative....another mistake on my part taking their word for it instead of going over legalese, turns out by resigning by the employers discretion all "slices" can be null and void. 
So not only did I not get anything out of the big company saving deal I made possible, any profit the company makes in the future if they continue to be successful without me I stand to gain nothing :/ On top of that I was the only developer to that point and don't get to own my code ha. 
Being more careful this time round with whom I work for, current job I'm going for is already established and in the green, many employees and been around a good while, might not have as much potential or influence but I don't think I'll be exploited like previous roles.

I'm not sure how likely that'll be with the role, it's programming. More often than not I've got to keep upskilling in my time off. I've heard that Uber is a good 2nd income source that is flexible, just my doctor doesn't advise me to drive :/
I'm presently flatting with 2 others in a small 2 bedroom home, nothing fancy place hasn't had anything done to it by owners in years. A small studio here will cost someone about 400 a week, if you want your own place that's more like a house to rent it's about 500 or so a week for a single bedroom. I think I'll be sticking to flatting for time being, culture here is less likely to see roommates who want to share rooms unless they're a couple. 
I'd be lucky to save $1k a year atm. If I get this role under current living conditions I should be able to save 25-30k a year. Relying on one job might be a problem to you, but quite frankly I'd just like to have a job right now. Market is very competitive, I know the answer you might be thinking is gtfo of there and move somewhere else but one that requires some money in the first place and two gives up citizenship/welfare support if anything goes tits up  far as I understand along with having to suss out things like work visas.
@_date: 2017-02-08 22:11:04
Haha, I think it was like this for many miners back then. They were worth fuck all for such a long time, then all of the sudden this burst to $20 and then a plummet again, only after 2 more bubbles did I start to think, well shit.
@_date: 2017-02-08 22:08:26
Aha, I looked at the history as I've held on to the half a coin since 2014 and it's only just getting back into that price range, so I guess it might go up again. 
Problem is I put it into a online wallet, StrongCoin that hasn't had any blog activity since 2014 either, my password for the account seems to be rejected when trying to login and their password recovery is not sending any e-mail to me...so perhaps I don't even have a half a coin anymore after all :\
@_date: 2017-02-08 22:29:46
Saving hasn't been too much of an option, haven't been that lucky. I did manage to save a few thousand but then one year while trying to progress my career chasing this carrot working rather poor conditions I lost 2k of my own savings and then at the end even though I did a good job and delivered they cut me off :/ don't really earn more than 10kUSD a year for the past decade. Where I live cost of living is high too. If I land the job it'll be a life changer though! Would easily be able to save decently from that point onwards.

I was an employee getting paid min wage. Company wasn't doing too well tbh, we had an agreement that if I got us the client I'd get some bonus to help cover some debt I owe, but nope. As I've said before I've not had the best of luck getting work, so I wasn't in much a position to put pressure on the employer whom I knew could barely pay me my weekly wages until I got us the six figures client. I just didn't expect them to be disrespectful of the agreement and be greedy, I wasn't asking for much at all.
That is some interesting conditions, especially the NDA being null and void and keeping your work. If I ever get back into freelancing and in demand enough I might use that!

I haven't read the article, so you might be right. AFAIK they're producing ASICS, those are built to do a specific thing very well, eg SHA256 for mining bitcoin. If the other coins don't mine that way(and many don't), then it's not able to mine them.
A regular GPU on the otherhand, while useless at mining bitcoin at a profit(at least for most people iirc), can be used to mine other coins at profit then convert that to bitcoin if you want(NiceHash does this).
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:59:31
Ahaha... I mined 34 coins or something in 2 weeks 24/7 at home while studying, they were worth cents. Then my graphics card died and for whatever reason bitcoin prices surged up to $20 a piece, sold 20 to get a new GPU, the currency bubble burst but months later surged back up to around $100 or something, sold majority of what I had left, I think I kept 1 coin. Then a year later worth $1k a coin, sold half a coin...what min wage is tough :( Ah... if only I knew to HODL back then. Have had 0.5 since 2013 and will continue to hold, but man :\ I understand the regret haha.
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:12:17


Depends on situation. It was really easy to get back when I mined it, but it wasn't worth shit back then, I don't even recall how I came across it and got into it. I wouldn't really bother getting it now, I'm fine just holding to what I got. It's good for people in third world countries where their currency isn't as reliable I guess? I remember reading that many did that.
If the history is anything to go by from what I've witnessed past 7 years it'll do something like you say and then spike up again nearing 10k. All speculation of course, :P I'm waiting to see what happens when the eventual cap is hit and coins can no longer be mined, only bought/sold. That news about Japan is a pretty good sign for bitcoins future.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:11:13
I mined 34 coins back in 2010, worth cents, sold on several spikes until 2013, HODLing my mere 0.5 btc left now ha. The value was stagnate/steadyish for the past 3 years, now all of a sudden it's spiking again. 
All I've noticed is this trend has longer down periods over time but it's always come back above and each time the value soars above the prior spike period :\ So maybe it'll be 5 years until the next time and it'll be 10k+ a coin, I'd be fine with that.

Seems to be StrongCoin specific. I found where to go to verify via their blog post that came in a search result. Unfortunately I can't seem to recall the password...perhaps I wrote it down or stored it somewhere 4 years ago but it's none of the many I usually used over the years.... I guess I might have lost access to my BTC ha...
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:29:48
That's a little worrying! I personally don't think I'm going to trust any wallet services. At best maybe an exchange briefly, but with the value of btc always going up and at such a large amount this year, it's concerning to trust these services(legit or not) from being safe from an attack.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:52:10
Found an old drive of mine from around the time I made the account, there was a password in a password manager database file, but doesn't seem to work. For all I know I have used the correct passphrase to decrypt the key but something else is preventing me from legitimately withdrawing my BTC :\
Links like [this one]( about StrongCoin around that time don't bring much confidence..

I don't even remember how/why I came across bitcoin in 2010. I mined it with my AMD GPU for two weeks before it died from being worked 24/7. Back then the 34 coins I got were worth less than cent each... being a broke student and kinda needing that GPU to use my computer for doing work(3D graphics) I was super excited to see the price spring up to $20 per coin, afaik it had never gone above a dollar back then I think? I didn't know anything about trading and wanted that new GPU so I sold the bulk of the coins. 
Then a year later or so value was around $100 each, and I think it was during 2013 it peaked up to a grand. Much regret ha, I did a bit more research and decided I'd just hold what little I had kept. It burst like all the others and fell to around 300-600 and stayed roughly like that for a few years until 2017 and this insane increase happened again :|
I'm at a point where BTC seems to be fine at continuing this trend of going up, the duration between bubbles might be longer but it seems pretty safe to expect the investment to pay off longterm? That said I've not put any money into BTC, never really been in a position to do so.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:24:53
Yeah, I haven't tried to login with the password given but I'd assume they prompt to change password again. The main website looks fairly decent compared to most scam sites which left me wondering if they were legit and just promoting/marketing their service with a fake signup to e-mails they sourced.
