Bingo! I bet OP changes his opinion on the whims of the people around him rather than thinking things through like this.
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:00:58
It's okay bro. We are all going to get through this.
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:56:45

FUD FUD FUD. Three articles in a row about this. Gargle a dick you fudge packer.
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:11:27
There are always idiots when it comes to markets. When people first got access to stocks, they would panic at every whim of the market.
Eventually people got smarter about it. Find something you belive in an put money into it, but never more than you're willing to lose.
One idiot's mistake can be a learning experience for  hundreds of others.
This is why I love companies with 401k programs. Take a small chunk of my pay and store it for me, that way I can pretend I made good decisions in the future.
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:13:54
People will adapt. We learned to use algebra, drive, and manage our time.
The next generation will learn to manage its finances too.
All these skills took time to integrate in humanity.
Even time was something that only began to matter in the last two centuries as people got busier.
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:55:42
I read it. People wanted to migrate to colder climates with cheap electricity.
Liberals being Liberals said:
 "Nuh uh! we want no one using our power that would otherwise go to waste and create the same amount of toxic waste! And we don't want wealthy people to exist either".
I love the article, very insightful.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:51:07
I swear journalists are just bloggers these days.
I fuckin hate them all.
If you have no idea what the fuck you're writing about, why are you writing about it??
I also like to hunt down their social media and bombard it with strong language and criticism. Immediate relief.
"Fuck you for being ignorant. You expect to win a Pulitzer for this?"- Hits them the hardest.
Bully journalists when they're wrong. They deserve it because their job is supposed to be correct and factual information, failing to be accurate means they bring shame to their craft.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:36:07
Hiding in plain sight is a good idea if no one comes to your house.
Pictures can give away a lot of secrets.
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:02:55
I don't care if I have friends. They come a dime a dozen. I have never had a meaningful friendship. I want to die and God denies me bliss every time I beg for it. I don't even want kids, but _FUCK YOU_. I will lecture my kids if I want. _They're my kids._
If I don't like something I will exercise my 1st ammendment right and offer a solution.
I don't hear a lot of jokes about child slavery and I find them in very poor taste.
Fuck me for trying to spread some awareness instead of insulting the guy.

People have been driving for almost 100 years.
There is going to be an emergency steering wheel in all self driving cars, people will continue to learn how to drive regardless.
I think a lot of people actually enjoy driving.

Oh sweet Jesus. This better be a troll post.

Yeah if you delete every economic depression/market crash from history the market looks fucking amazing.
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:27:06
Well each time Bitcoin has dipped I have gotten an ear infection.
I still have an ear infection so the dip shall remain a while longer.
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:30:24
I would buy from Binance then transfer to trezor. Idk how much it saves compared to Coinbase.
You should absolutely buy any dips under 9k. It always returns to 10k and sometimes 11k.
If you get lucky enough to buy the dips at 5k, you can legit double your money.
Find out why these dips are happening first. Don't go all in if people suddenly decide to ditch BTC.
I bet the next dip will come with Mt.Gox FUD. Buy that dip.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:37:38
I doubt society will change that much.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:56:38
Urgh I'm so sick of everyone around me giving me FUD irl.
Like, bitch I already have stress and depression. Who cares if I throw my money into a furnace?

Wow, well who's the monster that eats the tampons and wishes he was a girl? That's right. It's you OP. 
I know your secret.

There might be a war over this. I got a feeling the U.S isn't gonna take this well.

Except BMW tweeted confirming that Vechain was part of a partnership program that less than 5% of projects get to be  a part of.
It's not entirely false, it's just stretching the truth. Partnerships lead to quicker adoption. Look at Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. If those NFC/bluetooth services were offered from an unofficial app, none of us would use them.
Vechain is just Walton chain but better at PR, and partnerships despite being the bane of decentralization are key for new comers. Let them trust the technology and it will flourish.
Spreading misinformation won't help you or anyone around you, but I do see why people enjoy gossiping.
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:53:44
This article is bullshit btw.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:37:29

@_date: 2018-03-23 10:23:06
No because you can hide it anywhere. Inside of the leg of a chair, inside the frame of a pair of glasses, behind a book case.
You can even get a floor vault safe.
I know a guy who stores his seed in a jar of lube. You think a thief is gonna steal a jar of used lube?

Child slavery is no joke. For more information consider visiting the Child Labor Coalition's website:
I know I cannot fight child labor, but advise you to consider donating to the CLC.
I posted this because your joke _triggered_ me but I know I will accomplish nothing by being mean to you about a joke.
You do not have to do anything. I just felt strongly about this and still have no idea why I'm doing this.
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:06:23
That has got to be the funniest looking judge I have ever seen.

Or write it in a small notebook and lock it in a safe, which is then stored in a vault in the floor, covered by a rug and guarded by dogs with machineguns and a very small clone of Arnold Shwartznegger.

Well we will see who is right! Your Asshole vs My Ear.
Lets set the time to one day. If we don't see an uptrend in one day, my ear has more leverage than your asshole.
It's all in good fun, but lets have some friendly competition.

I know. We will lose the war (because we will underestimate them) and then America will switch roles and Russia will become a thriving culturally dominant country while we get laughed at and scorned by the world.
Happened in Vietnam, Happened in Korea. History loves to repeat itself.
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:04:35
Korea has always been ahead of the financial game, hard working and heavy drinking.
If they see potential in cryptocurrency, it would be a foolish idea to wait.
I bet ten years from now we will all be retired laughing about how hard this particular time was and how much more we should have bought.
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:47:49
BULLSHIT AND SCAM. How lucky are we to get the complete package?
Stuff like this should be reported to the FBI.
Edit: Yup, two day old account. Report the fucker.

Lets hope so. I doubt it.

Sometimes I feel like I'm being too nosy.
The old me would've done unproductive arguments that wouldn't solve anything.
I decided to go the unbeaten path and try to win the person on my side instead of being "High and Mighty".
Maybe it would be more relevant if we could get charities to accept cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2018-07-01 07:15:44
This post is a good indicator that bitcoin is going to plummet 50% soon.
See you all at 2.8k
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:28:20
A millenial is anyone born between 1985 - 2000 so I think at least 50% of millenials know what a stock is.
Also, Apps like Robinhood make it easy to get into stocks and crypto.
I agree with you with one thing though: a huge chunk of the millenials I meet are borderline retarded when it comes to money management and saving for the future.
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:06:01
These terms are just thrown about. No one really knows anymore.
