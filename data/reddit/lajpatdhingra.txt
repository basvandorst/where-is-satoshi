* [The real value of bitcoin and crypto currency technology - Bitcoin Properly!] ( Published 14 Oct 2014
Bitcoin in five minutes: Blockchain technology will drastically change our lives.
In the coming years, the technology behind crypto currencies such as Bitcoin will inevitably and radically change the role of traditional trusted parties such as banks, accountants, notaries, and governments. The animated video about Bitcoin that was released today on  is the first to specifically address the technology behind Bitcoin: the Blockchain. Within five minutes, it is explained how the essential functions of the “trusted third party” can be automatized through the Blockchain as well as what the implications of this are.

I'm creating awareness about bitcoin in Thane/Mumabi on daily basis. Yesterday A guy saw bitcoin sign at my office who is working for Morgan Stanley in Mumbai wanted to know more about bitcoin he was basically interested in investing in Bitcoin. I'm surprised many tech savvy community in India are still unaware about bitcoin.

Whenever I ask people in India about how money is being created they generaly either don't know or think its backed by gold. Sometime I ask them is it backed by Gold? They reply yes yes... Once Kids like these understand how money is being created they will then don't talk about value of Bitcoin and start using it in their day to day life. Many school and college studnets are excited about bitcoin and doing their projects, but there is no one in schools and colleges to guide them about how money works specially bitcoin. I guess these kids are exploring bitcoin on their own.

So today we organised the bitcoin [workshop in Thane (India)]( we got five participants. A documentary film maker, an advocate, two IT students and one entrepreneur came for workshop. All were impressed about bitcoin technology. But advocate was bit confused how bitcoin is working without any control of govt and central bank.
Anyways we hope we spread the bitcoin in India as fast as we can. 
The article title is very encouraging.
But should we trust central bank's views on bitcoin? Is there no conflict of interest? I'm bit confused. Earlier RBI issued notification and asked Indians to keep away or avoid bitcoin and other crypto currencies.
RBI please come to some conclusion about bitcoin in India. Allow people feel comfortable while they use it in their day to day life.

Many Indians don't use banking. Its easy to spread Bitcoin in India as many use smart phones. Govt. political parties getting more and more dependent on network to influence Indians. Its time many here should take baby steps. We need to convince and compare Bitcoin with current monetary system, otherwise how they can imagine the change and what is truth. Mainstream media don't talk much, people think Bitcoin is unofficial if its not backed/created by central bank or Govt. As far as I know currently only speculators use bitcoin in India.

If Indian political parties get convinced about bitcoin donations then only Indians from abroad and rural India can donate smoothly.
I can answer these question at best of my level, however I want they get convinced no matter who give inputs.

Introduced bitcoin to many in Indians, first questions they ask is it legal? How money can work outside govt control? Who control bitcoin etc.
If people don't hear anything from govt or mainstream media, they think its worth nothing and they ignore. 
Its also surprising many Indian don't know how fiat monetary system works.  
Yes some investor in Mumbai are interested but thats more as investment not using bitcoin as money in day to day life.
