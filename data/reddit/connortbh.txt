I use circle for purchases and Kraken for trading. I also left coinbase after them closing my account without reason.

Actually I left after they declined attempted transactions without reason. I just went back to check my account because they sent an email about something but they told me it was closed. So you're right, I really just misspoke there. Basically I was just extremely disappointed in the customer service so I switched out long before they closed my account.

2500 at once catches your attention more. Seems like it's more about making a statement or attempt at price manipulation.

Do you enjoy driving customers away? I used to use coinbase and made one successful purchase. Every subsequent one was deemed high risk, and support was not at all helpful. I've moved on to Kraken now. For a bitcoin company, support is absolutely crucial. Is there going to be any move towards transparency with support on high risk transactions?

I wanted to buy bitcoin from coinbase, succeeded once and then they marked every single other request as high risk without reason. Customer support was completely worthless. They wouldn't even let me send in any documents to prove I am who I say I am or anything. I'm a customer willing to throw money at you and you claim I'm high risk with no reason? Garbage.

The odds of winning have also since changed

I feel like Zuckerberg screwing them out of equity doesn't make them the bad guys.

Having an ETF will legitimize bitcoin to all investors. Institutional money is going to pour in. There's so much pent-up demand for an uncorrelated asset and it's mostly untapped because investment charters usually only allow for investment in SEC approved securities. I know if this gets approved I'm buying a ton of COIN in my Roth.

I enjoyed reading Mr. Williams comment. I think he raises some legitimate concerns that, if we're honest with ourselves, will draw intense scrutiny from the SEC. Of course I'm hoping and praying for this ETF to get approved, it's nice to see the other side's points.

It does otherwise we would never see it.

I don't really see this happening though. I see tremendous value in bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset in an inflation hedge model. I think demand will be net positive even if you are correct.

I mainly use bitcoin as a piece of my investment portfolio. Right now it's a pain and not terribly secure to buy and have on an exchange. Being able to hold it in my IRA would give me so much more peace of mind and make increasing my position much easier. I really hope the ETF gets approved.

At MIT you could create unlimited .edu addresses so I know a lot of guys who made hundreds of dollars that way.

I really like all the trading tools Kraken offers, although I don't see anyone recommending it so pardon my ignorance if there's something I don't know about.

I came into this article completely cynical but after reading I'm really impressed with the depth of this project. I like the idea of digital asset collection. There's something to be said about knowing items you possess are scarce. And the scarcity being verifiable is just icing on the cake. 
Anyone who says this is stupid should read the article and focus more on the principles and opportunities rather than these (admittedly extremely rare) pepes.

We really just need to know who this computer guy is mainly.

What? Unless the Bitcoin is going and placing things around, he means lying since it's 'resting' in his wallet. Did you even read the definition you linked to?

That's pretty bad man, I'm sorry you had such a rough go of it in high school English.

Kroger is the name of the store. You probably wouldn't call the other stores Walmart's or Sam's Club's.

My friends would joke that Bitcoin is just for drugs so when I sent my friend 10 dollars worth of Bitcoin I said "for the drugs" in the memo line. I was never able to buy Bitcoin on coinbase again. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:02:15
Definitely but to be fair it's now expired so you wouldn't be able to
@_date: 2015-02-28 06:59:36
Coinbase but the anecdote was basically for illustration of the principle. No good ever comes from putting illegal things in memo lines. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 14:27:51
No, you never use apostrophe s to denote plurality. In that case it'd be something like "you'll be able to buy bitcoin in Krogers, Walmarts and Sams Clubs" which also just sounds weird.
