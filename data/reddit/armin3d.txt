There's a high chance that your PC is infected or your Wi-Fi is rerouted in order to hack your Binance and possibly other accounts.
Proceed with strong caution until you find the issue.
It could simply be your PC time mismatch tho, make sure clock and date is accurate

Yup, true. but eventually, current ATH will be considered a cheap price in a few weeks.

BCH is not a new coin. It's been around for past few months. Now, only Coinbase/GDAX added it, it is not a big deal. they just added it for trading. It was enabled for trading in lot of other websites perior to cb/gdx.
so who is behind bcash? i guess it is coinbase and bcash owners. it just got pumped.
and who is behind bitcoin? world. people. all countries. remember, we could trade bcash before coinbase add it using binance, chinese exchanges and many others. coinbase only reflect US population. yet bitcoin is about world. 
so i am pretty sure bitcoin will rise up higher than before.
bch on other hand will get dump and later on it will continue it's slow rise same as other cryptos.

This is exactly what I kept telling to myself since $200 and cause me to delay my purchase until earlier this year.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:35:32
That's kind of presale value. If i remember correctly, bicoin diamond was much higher in presale value and one it launched, you can see it drop value.
Hope things go well with this one but it's a risk

I think best option is hardware wallet. Other than that, it's to install Linux on a flash drive and boot it using flash drive. Don't connect that flash drive to your computer inside your windows OS
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:57:41
I kept thinking it could crash to $1... until it rise to 280.. then i thought it will crash back to 200... until it rise to 480... i bought at 480... and sold when it crash to 350... and pretty much got distance from bitcoin until it pass 1000 borderline.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:25
Gdax had 2k spread, crazy. They show 14900 but they sell 16900, then they crashed

Bitcoin is periodically increasing value, while developers are working on it. Once new cool features such as lightning network added to it, you'll be sitting on best ever currency with high value.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:54:42
Until 20k which will be another psychological line for newbies?

Does Binance allow exchange from fiat? I doesn't seem to find it
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:26:46
Nope. That's because bitcoin is trustless. No 3rd party can control other addresses unless they have private key for it.

Venmo is US only, not possible to use to send money to citizen of other countries while travelling. Bank account takes days to transfer.
PayPal is not available everywhere either.
Yes, Only solution is Mastercard/Visa ATM machines, to get physical fiat, but it still does not allow you to send money to somebody in another country instantly.
Blockchain payment are changing that, where bitcoin is motivator of this change.

You see. when it was below 10, it would go up cent by cent, slowly until reach 10.
All eyes on 100, it would go dollar by dollar, 
Then all eyes on 1000, it would move 10 by 10.
Now, all eyes on 10000, it is moving 100 by 100.
