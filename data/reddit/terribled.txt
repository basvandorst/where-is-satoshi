He is the Peter Schiff (gold promoter) of BTC and is a heavily invested HODLr. What else should he say?
@_date: 2018-10-17 02:50:55
A non-sequitur argument. Without miners validating transactions there would be no cryptos regardless of the power source.
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:02:45
Thanks for that. They both look good in their own ways and the vulnerabilities I can live with. I got a nano-S on sale and am looking forward to loading my Lambo bits onto it. 8&gt;)

If you are wanting to download the BitCoin Core blockchain be prepared for a hella large download taking several days and currently using over 200 megs of your hard drive.
I tried downloading it several times and finally got a warning from my ISP that I was over my limit for the month.

I like the post. It makes people think instead of just accepting the Zeitgeist.

I just bought a nano, but both are find for what they are. Someone was dissing the nano because it wasn't open source but if it works as advertised I don't care.

Great video Phil. I hope you are correct in your guess. I subscribed to your YouTube channel but what is your Twitter Handle?

Telling me I have to worry about "tainted" coins is like saying that I should worry about USD in my pocket that has traces of cocaine. 70% at last look, but somehow I'm not worried.
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:34:13
My thoughts? Keep BTC away from Wall Street. Let them develop WALL coin and trade that.
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:54:30
I would have put the point across more simply...
No ETF's!!!
Crypto does not need ETF's or Futures and the vision is diametrically opposed to them. They simply allow money market makers to manipulate price action the same as gold ETF's, etc. We already have enough manipulation with whales splashing in the pools and don't need any others.
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:07:40
I was thinking maybe he was calling to say he had disowned you lol.
Good for him and I hope he can stay positive even if BTC goes to 1K.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:41:29
Yup, the penalty for trolling here is harsh. Really harsh. Don't even think about it.

I would have waited for more dust to settle but thats just me.
If BTC goes to 1-2K you will just be another HODLer smoking hopium.

Yes, that's Strelnikov. (Dr. Zhivago reference if you didn't know)
@_date: 2018-11-22 20:39:34
I appreciate the discourse but beg to disagree. If the coins are blended and perhaps only a small fraction are tainted, then whatever investigating authority you can imagine would know that fact as well and would hardly be tempted to take action since it is neither illegal nor immoral to use mixers and I have never heard of even one case where someone was locked out of an exchange for mixed coins.
However, I am a miner and have heard of someone complaining that the Genesis exchange wanted to know details of his mined coins because he deposited them directly from his mining wallet on NiceHash to Genesis, dare I say without running them through a mixer first.
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:09:29
IMHO its the perfect length for somebody just starting out or a refresher for the veteran. I am not a fan of short "clips" that try to pack too much information into too short a time frame.

I'm putting my extra cash into guns, gold, food and water. BTC is a luxury for me at this time. I have some but price may drop like a bag of rocks... nobody knows.

I upvoted your post, however I totally understand the need to reach out and ask for help in a bear market, especially for newbies. There are only a few places on the web that they can hear from crypto vets and this is one such place.
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:58:05
I understand the sentiments of people who have lost money and are haters. Like you I averaged in on the drop and am sitting pretty now. Just like with stocks and bonds, you don't lose or win until you sell. I can see a bright future for crypto in general and BTC in particular.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:34:33

Coinbase allows it with a credit/debit card or directly from you checking account. The fees seem reasonable.
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:12:18
"0"... lol I don't think so. BTC is here to stay.
@_date: 2018-11-13 02:08:28
I love it. Part of my business is buying physical gold and I am a serious HODLer of the yellow metal.
Oh, you meant BTC Gold?... not so much...
@_date: 2018-11-11 01:52:31
Trolls? You think you have troll bait here? lol
If BTC can scale you will see adoption, people SPENDING their BTC instead of HODLing it and PRICE will rise. 
Until then FUD yourself...
@_date: 2018-11-13 02:00:45
The only upside to BCH that I see is faster transactions and its more scaleable than BTC. That may be worth something.
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:13:46
The Tyler's at ZH are known to post doom porn on the weekends when things are slow.
Crypto cannot be killed. End of story.
@_date: 2018-11-10 15:19:03
I've heard BCH due to scaling problems with BTC and the Lightning Network not performing well but I forgot where I heard that... one of the podcasts I listen to. Except for the shitcoins, when BTC  moves every boat will rise or sink.
Oh, and there will not necessarily be an "explosion". There are a lot of BS talking heads out there. Blockchain is here to stay but BitCoin may or may not do well.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:39:16
The intent of that is to stop people from trying to give advice about when to buy and sell at specific prices.
All I said was that I bought at the lows. Me. My personal buy. No advice. lol
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:35:47
Matt, lizard450 is absolutely correct. What you have done is akin to a 1st Grader walking into a MIT physicists conference and asking for help with addition and subtraction. Sure, they could help you but why would they? Your questions are fairly ignorant... just sayin'.
@_date: 2018-11-09 12:27:55
In a recession the value of fiat will decrease and there will be less disposable income to invest in crypto as it will take more fiat currency to pay for the basics.
Precious metals prices will rise though.
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:29:12
Translation: "We will strive to centralize all crypto currency transactions so that we can track our taxpayers to make sure that none of them evade taxation."
Not that I am opposed to paying taxes. I am opposed to governmental controls or attempts at regulating crypto.

 "You can not convert to fiat currency right away like with some payment  processors, though in my personal opinion, the immediate conversion  ruins the whole point of accepting bitcoin and does not increase the  adoption.  The fiat conversion is coming very soon on BTCPay and  merchants will be able to immediately convert the whole amount or  partial to their local fiat currency through the exchange. "

Nice thread. I actually learned something. I also learned that I prefer old fashioned bulletin boards to reddit. Posts move so quickly down the rabbit hole on popular topics that they are almost not worth commenting on and are lost in a moment.

Hardly a "rout". Definitely high volatility and volume which is what people were asking for lol.
Try trading the NQ after AAPL earnings if you want to see volatility...

Miners will always be able to make profit validating transactions.
Whether it will enough to cover costs or not is presently unknown.

I'm thinking that the "slump" was a combination of things.
Yes of course the "hash war" with both sides selling off BTC to fund their positions.
Then the Hedge Funds realizing that BTC scaling was going to be a problem; the usefulness of everyday transactions would not be integrated easily into society as a whole (which will not be a problem in the future as Devs make new inroads) and:
Once the selling began, retail began to capitulate driving price down further.
A new wave of buyers in the future and new developments should change things but nobody knows the time line.

Unless the NSA is after you, coin mixing services are very valuable to the average Joe who does not want his transactions traced. I, for one am not a criminal but am always concerned about my privacy on the web. I use Duck Duck Go as a search engine and a VPS enabled web browser. Coin mixers provide enough security for someone like me.
But my intent was to support those who want to advertise legitimate services within a post.

Government gave us the Federal Reserve which created monopoly fiat US dollars which has led to a massive stock market bubble and debt that our grandchildren will never be able to pay off. And you want the government involved in crypto?
It is only worried HODLers who want BTC to rocket to the moon who want the stock market and government involved in creating ETF's. This is diametrically opposed to Satoshi's vision of a decentralized crypto currency.

I'm not saying it couldn't drop further but I am dollar cost averaging as I consider BTC a long term investment and not a get rich quick scheme. I like sellers.

If you follow Rand on Twitter you know he says stuff like this all the time.
The fact is, nobody knows if Sats was even a real person or if he is even still alive if he was real. 
And anyway, just because he got the crypto ball rolling, none of the price action from day one was his fault or responsibility.
