wow, crazy spreads!

Don't overthink it and just start with a small amount (whatever that is for you). I can recommend  as an exchange. Learn by doing, don't do by learning - it will get you nowhere.

It would still be the same, as the price would adjusr upwards, however since there is no knowledge about how much was lost, this is the calculation of market cap.

Here is an article by businessinsider, that just came out:

Oh golly, getting my popcorn waiting for another blocksize debate ;-)
Your transaction just needs to wait a bit - no worries!

In BIP8 it would be more of a 51% resolution afaik

Makes sense, since it is the first country where it is fully regulated. MORE COUNTRIES WILL JOIN! :)

Check out our whitepaper on COMIT

correct. In 2013 there was a drunk dude who wanted to write HOLD but he misspelled and wrote HODL. It became a meme. Hope that helps! :)

Some are actually doing that to my knowledge
@_date: 2017-05-03 02:43:39
someone doing the groundwork
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:53:27
Trust me, there are only a few traders making money. HODL and you will make so much more. It is all about emotions and learning to handle them! HODL!
@_date: 2017-05-03 07:53:06
We do! :-)

what do you mean?

We will see that in USD too soon. HAVE FAITH!

You would have to believe that a tether is worth an actual dollar. Just cause someone says so, doesnt mean much :-) otherwise ask Fort Knox ����

Better check your facts before spreading lies. Komodo does amazing stuff but has NOT done a BTC Lightning Atomic Swap.
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:49:30
Ok, and because we have now found a way how to pay rewards (check our news) it rectifies you spreading lies about a completely different topic?
