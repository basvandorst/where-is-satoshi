I prefer to use a mobile wallet, it works pretty well - great UX/UI. Have been using it since mid March without any problem. Actually it has very good ratings/reviews, but since I am new in Reddit wanted to read other things from the experts.

Thank you! DoWallet’s offer is simple; great UX/UI in 37 languages, mobile wallet, real time market, news: all in one place. Furthermore they offer support 24/7 in all the languages and once I asked something they answered me in less than 30 minutes. I tried and love it. I think that saying that something looks like a scam as one user said before before doing some research is negative for the industry. Thoughts?

Again, I think its negative for the industry the assumption that everything is a scam. I think the argument to say a wallet is better than other should be based on features and not on wrong assumptions. I tried it, received, sent and stored BTC in DoWallet ( without any problem.

Hahaha no problem! Check it out and let me know your thoughts. They are super responsive on support but before sending all my assets there I wanted some feedback (im a noob). I liked this wallet because it has many features in just one place including news in Spanish (im from South America). I use 2 different exchanges and after what happened with Binance I prefer to use a mobile wallet and I picked this one.

Totally agree. Which wallets are you guys using? Im using DoWallet.app, has anyone tried it?
