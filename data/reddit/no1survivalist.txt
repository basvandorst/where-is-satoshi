well you see kind sir, bitcoin is a miraculous invention that has taken up too much of my time. I have since opened many wallets, but you see this little code above you allows me to test that i have correctly imported my new private key to my wallet. Its currently set at 1 penny to donate. I only need a penny. 1 pennnyyyy. Indeed. If you need further information on the matter do let one know. Cheerio.
