Ignore lowerbrow.
Its an amazing first try, Some of the gradients don't look web safe, and don't blend correctly(off colors), There's a little too much noise in some places, noise needs to be as subtle as possible. the chosen grey for the labels(choose wallet, you need..., etc) needs to be changed as it looks a little awkward. The text directly next to that either needs a new font or needs to be bigger. Its overall rather small when compared to the surrounding elements as it seems to be an informative thing instead of displaying an article of some kind.
The "english" language select could be reused for the active page indicator albeit being more round. Though there's numerous things you could do that would work out well if not better than that. (suggested as I don't know your competence at photoshop/design)
There is a lot of empty space around the bitcoin logo maybe make it a tiny bit bigger and see how that looks.
And yes, it does look professional, looks more like a corporate design, but still it looks professionally done.

If there employing a lot of staff full time then those people obviously need to be payed. +server costs, admittedly that shouldn't be all that much. +travel costs to send wikileaks people places. Hell its gonna cost me almost 2 thousand when i travel here in a couple months. You could also think about how the CIA does things. They essentially buy information. Maybe some of there sources are really paranoid and want excessive security used in contacting them. who knows.
Though i will admit 80k does seem like more than they need. but I could be wrong on all counts entirely.

Ill be looking forward to seeing what you decide to do with it. So far I'm liking it a lot.
Are you gonna post it here in or someplace else?

hey can't blame someone for guessing that. Lots of kids think power comes from the magic gnomes living in the basement.
Seems like an interesting plan to me.
