Consider putting your your private keys into two safe deposit boxes at two at two different banks. That is the most security I can think of.

I think other comments have adequately responded. I will just say that I don't think a switch to crypto will increase the pool of people contemplating physical crimes to take others' money.

I'm in the same boat!

I agree with your scenario. These individuals who are already being victimized will still get victimized. Now these people will lose their cryptocurrencies in addition to everything else. 
My only assertion is that I don't think crime will increase. I do not argue that cryptocurrencies will decrease crime, except maybe white collar crime.

When it comes to criminal behavior, I believe that people are irrational actors. From my general experience (I don't have numbers for this) I see that most people don't commit crimes just because that is the moral thing to do. And for most criminals, the crimes they commit are substantially outweighed by the potential punishment, I believe even when factoring in the chances of getting caught. 
Granted, cryptocurrencies, once taken, are hard to recover for the victims. But the chances of getting caught for a physical crime stay the same. Even if the criminal does successfully launder the cryptocurrencies, they still can't be spent in prison.

Constructive reply--it really adds to the community. Also, congratulations; I see that all of your previous posts are error free . . . .

Look into Coss.io. I think they may offer that capability.

I just skimmed the regulation. It looks like it only applies to businesses that sell virtual currencies, not to buyers and, arguably, not to occasional private sellers.

Well, crime in the physical world already exists. Just think of all the ways a bad actor can force an innocent person to produce cash. I don't think we will see any change in this area re cryptocurrencies.

That is interesting. Perhaps the company is registered in a different state. I recently looked at setting up a bank account for a non-profit. At least at the bank I was looking at the non-profit had to be fully registered with the state and show proof of compliance with various regulations before the bank would create the account without attaching a real person to that account. 
Anyway, it sounds like you have already done some digging and know what you are doing, I bet you eventually find the fraudster.

Ahhhh, this reminds me of a law school exam question. 
It really depends on how much effort you want to put into this. You have legal options, but you need to weigh the potential value you are seeking with the chances of losing and the costs of a lawsuit. But if you want to go all out, here is a start:
Make two seperate, alternative claims (meaning you cant win on both): 1. Sue the business named on the bank account, requesting the return of your money because the are not entitled to it. 2. Sue "John Doe" for performance of the contract--meaning he has to give you the amount of bitcoin that you bought, or at least your money back. You can have the court subpoena the bank, LocalBitcoin, and even the phone company associated with the phone number, to get details on the owner of the various accounts. Specifically, to get names and addresses. Then you add that person to the lawsuit.  
With that information, you will still have trouble proving that the "seller" you pull into court is the actual seller. However, the business doesn't really have any defense entitling them to keep your money that I know of. 
Depending on how much money you lost here, and if you do choose to pursue a lawsuit, a lawyer may be necessary. You could probably figure stuff out on your own with a lot of effort, but a lawyer already knows how to file papers, court rules, how to prove a case, etc. 
Note: This is NOT legal advice; I'm just thinking out-loud here. I'm not well versed in this area of the law. It is very possible I am wrong on multiple counts. :)

I don't know about exchanges, but arbitration clauses are very pervasive in most areas. A business withour such a clause would be an exception, and I would question the quality of their lawyers. 
Overall, I like these clauses at the moment. Arbitration doesn't result in legal precedent. Also, I don't want to even think about a court trying to deal with cryptocurrencies. Could you imagine what would happen if a court tried to order an entity unwind a block chain to return a coin? I don't know but I'm sure it would be chaos.

Perhaps tax season in the US and the government's regulatory response to its inability to collect. This is just a feeling that I have. No evidence.

1. Absolutely don't try to hide it. That is illegal and could severely backfire on you. 
2. I believe that in community property states some gifts to an individual spouse do not get divided. So it can depend on where the money came from, why it came from there, and who specifically it was given to. 
3. Get a lawyer. A lawyer will help you with the above. Also a lawyer really helps to make sure all money you have to pay for child support and spousal support are reasonable and have clear future termination conditions. I also assume you want some degree of custody. 
4. Get a lawyer and see 3 above.

Coss.io is both a merchant payment gateway as well as an exchange. However, coss is pretty new and I don't know if they provide services in the US. 
Disclosure: I bought into coss.

Don't do it. Bankruptcy is a big deal and sticks with you. Having a bad credit score goes beyond mere money. For example, employers are allowed to use it as part of denying you a job or promotion. 
Just use cash from savings--it's much, much safer.
