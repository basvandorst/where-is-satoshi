You'll be fine. They're most likely just overloaded with traffic and upgrading infrastructure. As long as you got to the transaction confirmation screen you're fine.
Either that or its a huge ruse and we're all

I think your first step is to talk to your financial institution and get the exact fees/tax hit that will occur when you pull out early from your 401(k).
Then weigh that against all options - I like that you aren't planning on going all in on BTC with the money you pull out, and can see this being a good move. However, any "responsible" person would tell you to keep it in the 401(k) and to only invest money you're fine losing in BTC - given it's uncertain future and record of extreme volatility.
So yea, step one first, then re-evaluate.

I assume you've already read the paper that started it all, but if not [here's a link](
For those unable to open, it's a link to Satoshi's original whitepaper.

Same here.  My takeaway from this past hour, after briefly entertaining the idea of doing a quick-sell, is to set a definite "don't sell until X time" rule, regardless of fluctuation in price. While maybe not the smartest, it eliminates the stress and captures what I see as the true worth: the long-term value of BTC.

Except for the wannabe day traders who cut their losses and sold back at 600. Leave the speculating to Wall St supercomputers, get in for the long haul.

I think the fact that you are soliciting donations for what on the surface appears to be a selfish purpose might rub people the wrong way.
You should make a pledge/promise to donate all proceeds to a Bitcoin related foundation/cause.
But yea, just like chalash said - if you're just looking for transaction data, it's easy enough to manipulate (not what you're going for, but if you're in a pinch, have at it).

I (can almost) guarantee you will post this exact same sentence next week if you do nothing now.  Ditto for the week after, the month after, the year after...

Next week you'll be plenty proud of your buy-in, don't worry :)
