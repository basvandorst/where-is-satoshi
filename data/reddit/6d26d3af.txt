It can and will be leveraged to empower the user instead of the middlemen controlling the bottleneck. Take BitTorrent — did it not equalize how filesharing is done and removed power away from the entities that control the "pipes". We'll see the same movement within the financial system.

Well you were talking about investment bankers so I gave a sample sector/entity. Again, you're looking at bitcoin which is fundamentally flawed in some cases. How about smart contracts? How about disenfranchising these people?

That cannot be done forever. Also nobody said this will be easy, and without blood being shed, but over time this will prove to be a better solution. I'm not saying the state will resign to decentralized tech though... just commenting on the inflation vs whale manipulation point.

Gini index improves. Don't you think that matters? Haha of course there will be extreme volatility in the meantime, duh.

If we can create an open financial system for everyone (for the unbanked and all that), that's not good? Maybe we're looking at different things then. I don't care about investment bankers in this new paradigm... Not sure what you meant by that. I'm bullish decentralized tech like Cardano and there's definitely something to be made that will disrupt Wall Street (if that's what you mean).
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:33:54
That's not the formula though.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:15:25
Strawman galore. I seriously thought you weren't trolling. Thanks for playing anyway.

I actually mistyped, I meant bind `Caps Lock` to `F5` or what have you (got confused because I have `Caps Lock` bound to `Esc` as a developer). 
But now looking back `Esc` looks like it was a joke to make things more difficult so I'm leaving it as is :-)
@_date: 2018-09-25 13:33:29
Yes it was delayed to Dec 29.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:33:30
Well yes, if you're greedy you will sell :-)
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:35:43
Bind reload to `Esc` and tap that thing with your pinky.

Err from where I stand I see more positive regulation, where do you live?
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:59:11
Adorable! But it scares me how big the third smile is supposed to be.
@_date: 2018-10-02 05:49:24
Because we will give you and we want to make sure.

I don't think diversification applies to interest. Do you want to diversify your love life too?

Folks, that's why PoS is the future and PoW is considered unsustainable in the long run. It's not about the electricity bill...

Wow perfect trade.

IMO Black Mirror paints a world wherein the cypherpunks failed.
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:23:21
New Internet is actually MaidSafe or Blockstack. Better yet, Urbit. Ethereum has always been "world computer".
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:33:43
Then people like you appear to give a realist's take.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:47:35
First time I read that lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:59:58
Why do you have to clarify your speculation?
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:31:26

Their TA makes good sense. Don't just dismiss something you don't understand.

12k will wipe most of them out if they haven't covered yet.

This line of resistance moves lower actually over time.
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:40:26
He he heyyyyy
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:20:19
Yes this is a very good confirmation, if anything. I would also confirm the freaking January bear market – we now know to hedge better next year.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:05:26
But that's not what they said. Thanks for proving my point :-)
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:52:34
600 CSO block reward but the airdrop is 1:1 for ETC. Normies buying this shit regardless.
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:39:23
Do you not want people to buy? So bitcoin should just go to zero?
