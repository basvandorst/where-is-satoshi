This is just FUD. There's no problems with bitcoin at all.

If you are in the US, Coinbase or Circle are your most reliable bets.

You are not supposed to actually use bitcoin to buy stuff!

How do you know organized crime don't post things on Silk Road? More importantly, even if they don't already do so, as cryptocurrencies become more widespread, I bet many will look to online as a way to diversify their business. Everything about selling narcotics online makes sense. They have to spend less time protecting a territory, incur less risk, and potentially reach more clients with higher willingness to pay.  It is unknown whether this new avenue will cause organized crime to increase or decrease at a local level.

This is hilarious. What makes you qualified to develop a financial trading system that is "better" than Mt.Gox. I use the word better in quotes because you don't actually say how you are going to be better than Mt.Gox except that you will make things "easy". Okay bud. 
Your project has no development so far and yet you expect people to fund $100,000? Your proposal wouldn't even be accepted on Kickstarter.

Why don't you just use Preev.com

Any event that happens = time to buy. Love the way you read the tea leaves.

Except people have no financial incentive to demote BTC prices since you can't short BTCs at the moment. Bears, however, have a lot to gain to pump the stock.

No dude, you don't understand! Something vaguely connected to money happened this week. Time to buy bitcoins!

This is a ridiculous pump up post. 


Are you kidding? This statement just reeks of a ponzi scheme. Crazy optimistic numbers with extremely low probability of this ever happening.


Making something more and more rare doesn't make it suddenly become more valuable. Whale oil became scarcer and more expensive until someone found an alternative in kerosene. There's no reason to believe why someone will not develop a better electronic currency with better security, stability, and liquidity tomorrow.

r/bitcoin is actually a great place to run your scam. People here are generally gullible and will buy into anything that has the word bitcoin in it. You will find much success here!

That's an interesting point. I don't know of the many changes that BTC has gone through recently as I haven't been following it for very long. I wonder what you think about this democratization of BTC. Will BTC be victim of its own success? (i.e. the flood of uninformed users to BTC making it so necessary changes are not adopted) Or will there ever be a super majority situation, in which an oligarchy can control BTC?
