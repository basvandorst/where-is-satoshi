Do you use the received donations to buy supplies directly -- I mean: do you pay for the supplies with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:15:44
This is a thing that must be done. Bitcoin has to reach these people somehow and this is a very good way.

When you hold these food giveaways and all the charity activities, do you use the name "Bitcoin" and do people talk about it?

That's necessary for other users to be able to connect directly with you when they don't know anything about the network.
If your node is connected to others, however, you should be able to connect to an unknown node only by its id.

This is a no-article. Brazilian inflation has absolutely zero relation to Argentina's inflation. And then they mention Mexico? There's no relation at all between Brazil and Mexico.
Actually, Brazil is one of the places where Bitcoin is worst widespread. All we have here are a bunch of stupid illiterate youngsters that love "crypto" but only because they want to get rich with speculation. There's no Bitcoin community at all.
