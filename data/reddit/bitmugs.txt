And really interesting that you talk about surviving on it's own merits.   The ORIGINAL plan was for him to run this Reddit account himself and reply himself.   But profoundly shallow, hate filled, obnoxious, assuming and judgmental criticism from trolls with nothing better to do than attack made us change course.

So sorry -- it reached the daily limit with Bitpay, we are working on fixing it
@_date: 2014-09-21 20:43:58
Amazing how quickly people assume the worst about others.  Very sad
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:18:10
Yes, we reached the limit.  :(
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:37:02
Oh in that case it makes perfect sense.
You are comparing a 7 year old to bad CEOs and assuming his parents don't teach ethics without ever meeting the child or parents or knowing the first thing about them but simply and solely because he has a business selling mugs.

This is a pre approved site
@_date: 2014-09-21 21:14:44
Thank you!

That is very nice of you --

We tried to have my son post this himself earlier..... But sadly the post was trolled immediately by a couple bad apples.
The plan was that he could read the comments himself and reply....but we will now post this on his behalf and selectively reply.
A couple notes:
Yes this is really his business, he has a contract to pay back the one Bitcoin he used to start it 
He picked all the designs, the name, domain, the entire idea himself -- he does the shipping and packing --- it took him over a month,  he waited daily for the inventory to arrive.
Every step from writing to the domain he worked on himself.
Obviously his parents and babysitter helped him --- it was designed as a learning experience.
If you have question for him or the parents please holler --- but please please be cool

These comments are so strange.
We sat down together, had a lesson on how websites work.  We looked at a few options such as some pre-made sites, Drupal and Wordpress.  Ended up going with wordpress for ease.  Picked what is perhaps the most simple template they have, it's called "one column", picked the colors, added the images and he wrote the copy.
Obviously he had help, it's a learning process.
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:24:31
He wrote the web page himself --- so your criticism is to a kid.
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:46:53
Obviously I didn't mean unsupervised.   Seriously please just go away -- you are an unbelievably negative and cruel person.
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:06:47
There doesn't seem to be a way to adjust shipping by location.   We will see if there is a shipping cart solution or way to add it.
@_date: 2014-09-22 07:45:02
He's not converting to usd
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:31:18
Yeah - a clip from a Michael Moore film is really relevant and you know exactly what we teach as parents.
@_date: 2014-09-21 21:17:43
To be honest I am not sure how to do that on the Bitpay service, let us take a look
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:47:00
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-21 19:41:41
Thanks a lot for ruining what was an exciting day for a kid who worked on this for a month 
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:26:44
Yeah, so sorry when he came to us excited to start a business that we didn't tell him to hide his age because "Jeanne from Reddit" thinks that a picture of a kid is equivalent to a plea.
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:33:15
We have the application in for increase so hopefully soon.
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:11:18
I think we reached our daily limit for Bitpay of $100.  Bummer
@_date: 2014-09-21 21:15:47
Yes, the point is not to be in a court but to help him understand each party's responsibilities 
@_date: 2014-09-21 21:55:59
Haha - this was enough work and we don't quite have it right yet.   If this goes well he can decide about other alt coins but I'm thinking it's not super likely, key is simplicity.

It costs about $5 to have them made and printed, $1.5 for bulk shipping then another .60 cents for the shipping materials and $2.25 to ship back.   The pricing is about exactly the same as Amazon pricing for custom mugs.
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:18:28
Designing a product then selling it retail ----   You have a very odd definition of "rip off"
@_date: 2014-09-21 20:33:36
Yes, why not?  It's to help him learn and take it seriously 
@_date: 2014-09-21 20:20:30
He has to pay back the original amount he borrowed to start the business which is one Bitcoin -- either in USD or Bitcoin.
After that he can use the profits for what he wants.
We are encouraging him to save some, give some to charity, spend some and use the rest to expand.
@_date: 2014-09-22 08:19:49
Purposely using an incorrect address -- you must feel great about yourself.
From your history, looks like you did exactly the same thing to another parent who mentioned a Bitcoin business with a 5 year old.....I guess that's your thing.
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:57:02
Thank you for being one of the few posts we can share with him.
