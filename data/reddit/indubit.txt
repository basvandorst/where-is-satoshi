Don't make your first purchase a 'test' or partial order. You won't be able to buy again until the first one clears.

The same can be said for any currency. It's the network that matters. Anyone can come up with a competing internet protocol, but people will use the one most useful. There is not an infinite supply of cryptocurrency on the bitcoin network.

When I went through this, MtGox was reliable. I haven't worked with others. CampBX maybe. Coinbase is our bitstamp front. Btc-e is way too sketchy. Someone else will have to recommend something.

At the same time, it shouldn't be trivialized. The fact that a studio of a major company saw a niche opportunity and seized it is, in fact, a significant win for bitcoin. This is exactly how I expect bitcoin to grow from niches to mainstream acceptance.

I put it at 3 years, but I'm trying to see the 'conservative' side so that I don't feel too foolish when I'm wrong.
Over the past four years, bitcoin has grown an order of magnitude each year.
This year we said goodbye to $100 (hopefully). Next year, $1000. Then $10,000, and then $100,000. The only assumption is that bitcoin will continue to grow as it has so far.
I think it's safe to say we're still in the early adoption phase, and we're four years in.
So what do you think will go wrong that will stall growth for 7 years?

If you're in the US, coinbase.com is the easiest. The only requirement is a bank account. Credit cards can only be used as a backup (for them, not you).
I agree with though. At this stage, I think a pool would be easier to coordinate.
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:21:39


Highly possible over the next 10 years, possible over the next 5 years, and currently on track to reach it in 3 years.
That is, **if bitcoin continues to grow as it has grown** for the past 4 years, we will reach $140k in a few years.
Many expect resistance in the near future will slow our rate of growth (e.g. regulations). Unabated, I expect bitcoin to grow more like a protocol than anything else. Think how fast HTTP grew, even with the dot-com bubble.

$100,000 in three years (not full saturation).
The only assumption here is that bitcoin will continue to grow as it has so far. Over the past four years, bitcoin has grown an order of magnitude each year.
This year we said goodbye to $100 (hopefully). Next year, $1,000. Second year, $10,000. Third year, $100,000.
Growth will taper off after the early majority phase, but I doubt that will be significant three years from now.

FLOPS: **floating-point operations** per second.
You're comparing apples and oranges. A supercomputer can eat a gagillion apples per second. How many apples do bitcoin miners eat? 0. Bitcoin miners eat oranges. Miners can eat oranges faster than a supercomputer can eat apples. So what? Apples are much harder for computers to eat than oranges.

Seriously, though... You don't need to make the ride any crazier than it already is by trying to time the market. Most people don't win that game. Just hold and enjoy.
