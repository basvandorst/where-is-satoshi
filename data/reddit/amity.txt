They removed them because they supported XT, not because they threatened them.

Definitely recommend this site, you can trust them OP.
They do it for free, but don't be an ass and take all the money without paying them. They ask for 20% of what's recovered, which is more than fair considering you'd have lost 100% if it wasn't for them.
Since you seem to know the password, it should be very easy and quick for them to decrypt it. It's likely just a small mistake, and they'll easily decrypt it. Here's what they say they can do on their site:


    If you were sure that you wrote down the password 'Hdd%&amp;7d77ddH when you chose it, but now it will not unlock the wallet when you type it in, then we can help.
    If you were pretty sure that your password contained words from a sentence from 'The Return of the King', but you've forgotten which page, then we can help.
    If you reckon that your password is some permutation (with some spaces or maybe capitals) of 6 of the words in the list { 'fred', 'hello', 'from', 'Butter', 'elephant', 'if', 'unlikely', 'green', 'grep', 'gorilla', 'antelopes' }, then we can help.

Not sure why people are downvoting this guy. He has a good point. It's so hard to properly store your bitcoins with no risk of them getting hacked, which is a massive problem with bitcoin for new users.

As someone who absolutely loves his Ledger nano, I can say Ledger is definitely a company worth your time. 
The Ledger nano is a great product and just as secure as a Trezor - as long as you trust the computer you set it up on, and use the mobile app for 2FA. Their new firmware will also enable you to set up the Ledger on a compromised computer (it's a little complicated understanding how this works, but it sounds great), so if you're wary of buying one now, you should definitely get one when that comes out.
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:23:33
This is a bit late, but Darknetmarkets.org is a scam website that links to phishing websites to scam people out of their bitcoins - why would people NOT get links from reddit? It's the one place where you'd be able to instantly know if someone is phishing you.

He asked for a place to buy bitcoins, not a wallet to store them.
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:47:40
Doesn't mean it's completely secure. People should just keep their BTC on a hardware wallet, and if a Trezor is too expensive, get a Ledger. I own a Ledger wallet that was set up on an airgapped computer and uses 2FA on my mobile to prevent someone altering the address on my laptop, and I can sleep happy knowing that my Bitcoins are as safe as they can be without using cold storage.
@_date: 2015-09-10 17:46:52
You know how in bitaddress you use javascript to generate a public and private key? This website basically does the same. When you request to go to page 136574537536 the private keys are generated when you go there. But the private keys on 136574537537 don't actually exist on the website yet.
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:59:23
They're not required by law to actively track every single transaction from their site and make sure it doesn't go to any wallets known to be owned by illegal websites.
That's just something they do to prevent them getting in trouble later  on.
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:14:19
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:43:22
Yet still they do, better to buy it somewhere without 30% fees.
For me though, it's less of an investment than a way to take control of my money. Most of my money is kept in my bank account, but I've put a decent amount in Bitcoin. I said it's not so much an investment, as I also regularly spend my Bitcoins wherever I can.
And if they're worried about it being so volatile, then there's services that hold your bitcoin for you, and keep it at the same price. If I put in $100 of bitcoin today, then withdraw it when the price drops by 20%, I'll still get $100 of bitcoin back. Mycelium just integrated one of these into their app. I wouldn't trust them with my money, but for some people it's a great option.
@_date: 2015-09-15 18:42:51
Wrong. There's much more stolen amazon account fraud than credit card fraud on purse.io.

Those are not your coins.
@_date: 2015-09-10 17:43:04
They point of 8mb blocks isn't to stop stress "tests", it's to allow Bitcoin to be ready to grow a lot. Although stress tests are unlikely with 8mb blocks, as they're only happening because Coinwallet.eu want 8mb blocks. Don't blame XT though, they already said they do not support any stress tests.
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:32:59


That's exactly what they're doing.
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:44:42
Bitpay just showed us that insurance doesn't matter. If there's a human error, the company suddenly shuts down, it's hacked, or any of the other things that could very easily happen to Coinbase, your coins are gone. Insurance may protect against a hack, but it shutting down or a human error? Nah.
@_date: 2015-09-24 20:21:15
Giving coinbase your coins, and basically your private key, is like giving a valet driver your car keys, then signing the car over to him with nothing but a promise that he'll give it back to you later on.
You clearly have *no idea* what you're talking about, so I suggest you do a little research. Storing coins in an exchange is only a promise that they'll give you the coins when you ask them. But as thousands of people learnt with Mtgox, they don't always give them back.
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:09:39
It requires a fingerprint as verification. This has been proved time and time again to be insecure.

How good are Bitcoin books? I've seen them, but always dismissed them as some sort of explanation of Bitcoin for new people. Are they actually worth reading for someone who's been involved in Bitcoin for quite a while?
@_date: 2015-09-21 19:34:58
Smart idea actually. Can't wait to see this role out beyond Copay.

There's a very big difference between hundreds of ads all over unreliable websites and some actual, real, popular ebooks sold on one of the most popular public hacking forums with thousands of active members.
@_date: 2015-09-15 18:40:25
Copay.io is a fantastic wallet. I have a 2of3 wallet on my Android phone, old iPhone and my laptop. It used to be my main wallet, and I had stored a couple of thousand dollars in it. Recently I've moved most of my funds to my Ledger wallet, but Copay is still a great free wallet if you have more than one device.
It doesn't require you to register an account, has a nice interface, and it's incredibly simple to use. The best multisig wallet imo.
@_date: 2015-09-11 22:22:25
These people have reputations to keep up, I'm sure they'll return it to you. Others have done the same loads of times.

There was an eBook about it being sold on a forum. Taught people where to get stolen accounts, how to trick amazon support into refunding items to the account's amazon gift card balance, then how to buy stuff on purse. Judging by the hundreds of replies and reviews, I assume it's pretty popular.
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:58:46
Use one of the dozen other better block explorers. As for their wallet, no idea why anyone would be using that in the first place.

Hence the reason he's made it open-sourced.
@_date: 2015-09-21 19:31:38
Whilst many people don't like this because of it's lack of security, I think it could be an important step into making bitcoin easier for everyday users. Yes, it has its flaws. But so did bitcoin when it started.
I hope to see case improved upon, and genuinely think this could play an important role in bringing widespread adoption.
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:38:49
In my case, it's actually my own bank account. In the UK you can have an account from age 11 onwards.
Now that they've simplified the process, there's little difference whether your parents do it or you do it. But I personally would rather have 100% control over my money, not sharing it with my parents like that.
@_date: 2015-09-19 23:51:03
Electrum uses python, could help them out. There's quite a few bugs on it, so anyone who found the time to iron them out would be a hero (look on bitcointalk for the thread where someone listed the bugs)

This is everyone thinks Bitcoin will skyrocket one day. I must be one of the few people who wants it to stay where it is, or at least make a very slow, very steady rise.

In order for it to be spendable, it has to be confirmed. You need to add a fee to get something confirmed - you likely did not do this.

You gotta say more than that.

Two weeks late to the comments, but Ledger is also creating Ledger Unplugged, an NFC card which is just as secure as the Nano (hardware-wise, at least) and makes it much easier to spend your Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-09-11 18:05:24
Since nobody replied to this...
A seed is a series of words (usually 12 or 24) that is then changed into a HD private key. This means that these series of words create a special key which is then used to generate all your bitcoin addresses.
This seed allows you to recover your bitcoins from all of your addresses that you use with the Ledger, but it also removes all the security features the Ledger brings if it is stolen. A thief could simply type in the seed and have all your BTC.
The seed can be imported into any BIP39 compatible wallet, the most notable being Mycelium and Electrum.

You must have typed it in wrong, no other possibility.
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:20:39
You should definitely get a Nano. No security differences, but it looks like a much more high quality product (and it has a cool neck thingy, so you can literally wear thousands of pounds/dollars/whatevers around your neck)
Ledger Unplugged will also be great when it's released. I have an early copy (can't use it yet, as the flashing process hasn't been finished) and I can just tell it'll be absolutely brilliant. It reduces security a little as you can't use 2FA to another phone, but other than that it's the most secure option you can get for a phone (excluding the very expensive Trezor). And it still has the two factor authentication with the security card, so it's pretty safe as long as there isn't malware on your phone that's specifically designed to target a Ledger wallet, and even then you'd have to do two dozen transactions for the malware to build a copy of the security card.

So the alligator doesn't bite until it's finished its business?
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:37:23
They track your payments. This is so they can catch people using it for illegal means, but there has been reports of them freezing accounts by mistake.
The referral free rise from $25 to $75 is also pretty suspicious, and some people have said it could be a sign that business is down for them - something I think too.
@_date: 2015-09-27 19:59:33
Copay does the exact same thing now.
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:52:26

Tumblers have reputations to keep up, especially the ones used by thousands of drug users that buy online every day. If they stole the funds, people would instantly lose trust in them. Besides, if the person is smart, they'll send in a small amount of BTC at a time.
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:56:12
In your opinion, does that mean it's likely to go down soon?

This is great news! I've been wanting to do this ever since I got my Ledger.

Let's pretend you own addresses 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Nobody knows you own these addresses.
Now let's pretend BitPay owns address 10, and that is assigned to you and only you.
You send some money from address 1 to address 10. A week later, you send some money from address 3 to this same address, as BitPay is re-using it. Now a month later, you send money from address 4 to BitPay's address.
BitPay, and anyone with access to their servers (or anyone who can do blockchain analysis to work out which addresses BitPay owns) knows that addresses 1, 3 AND 4 are all owned by the same person. You just lost all privacy that a HD wallet got you.
