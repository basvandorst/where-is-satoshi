Same here. Meanwhile Coinbase verified me in under 24 hours this week!

I don't think you can make up facts. What you can make up is fiction. Information can be classified into one of the two categories.
On a side note, this sub is crazy.

While they are a federal savings association, they feel more of a credit union then a bank. They offer more products and services (mortgage, home owners insurance, renters insurance, life insurance, auto loans, etc) than a bank as well. I have been a USAA member for over a decade now and will never do business with a bank.
Not saying what you said is incorrect, I just understand what is saying.

If you have an extremely ignorant person, send them $5 worth of BTC. Make them believe.

That's why it's a factional currency. The object isn't to collect whole Bitcoins like they are Pokémon.

You know what makes the most sense? Fractional currency.

I just opened my Coinbase account on Monday of last week, decided to add a USD wallet on Monday, and was verified in less than 24 hours on Tuesday. I followed all the directions, made sure that my ID was clear, legible, didn't have a glare. I also used my PC Webcam to do so.
Reading all these horror stories makes me question why was it so difficult for so many when it was so easy for me?

BUT BUT BUT crypto is so hot and if I don't just buy blind and be a part of it all, then I just won't be cool enough! I will be the laughing stock of all my peoples if I have no Bitcoin!

Wait, who doesn't use BCH?
