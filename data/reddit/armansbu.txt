I'll add some wind turbines to the mix with 6 tesla power walls on top of it.

That's been the pattern, every next jump to major drop is always over 10x. Usually within 2 to 3 year periods between 10x to 80% drop. 10x is my cautious(bear) signal, 80% drop is my bull signal. Always go against the grain, you come out way better at the end of the day.

FUCK, okay your right. 10 dollars off, maybe 20 if it incentives more, but no more than 30!

Yeah, what do you think the solar panels are helping write off?
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:57:41
You don't, but a fair guess is that if your 10x of the last all time high, then it's time to wait for the correction. Or play the odds but that never turned out well for me.

Hey, back the fuck off, I already started talking about turning this place to a mining operation up top on the thread! Unless you want to go halvees on this buisness venture? I want to solar and wind turbin it up with some power walls to offset the cost of electricity, as well as get some write offs on property tax. I get that stuff, you get the mining rigs?

Shit I would buy it if I had the btc for it, and then rent it for btc, I'd also offer to rent it for cash, but would give them an option for paying in btc with a 100 dollar monthly discount for paying in that form instead of useless perpetually devaluing fiat currency.

In that case, I'll fit the bitch with solar panels and use it as a mining location. If I find a renter to go along with the mining operation then awesome, if not, I got some people over there who would love to be paid to live in a house just to maintain mining rigs.

I've been buying back in since 8k, buying all the way down to 5k, and back up to 8k.

He's actually not wrong, we do wan't it to be low for longer, takes a lot of time to inject back what we took out in a way that doesn't rise the price up to much. Be patient, we just need a little more time.

Why not both? Can have double the income sources with a small mining operation set up in a closet, could calculate the size that would be covered by the solar panel and turbine plus power wall capacity, while leaving some room for house usage. Then you got 2 revenues. Sure the mining won't be significant compared to the air bnb, but set it to mine Stellar, or Cardano, and it can grow to something sizable when they're added to coinbase. You could also set ventilation pipes to the closet and double it as a heating unit for the cold days, or feed it outside for the hot days.

You convert what you need for cost and taxes, the rest stays in as potential profit, or you can convert a portion for profit too while leaving another portion to hodl. It's how I run all my crypto companies, convert only what I need, the rest stays to grow, unless were at an all time high, then I convert most of it and wait for the next drop to put it all back in at much cheaper prices. Rinse wash repeat.

It's because I told my uncle who works for the sec to push it back. Let him know that I'll have a couple coins ready for him if he does. Needed more time to grab more coins, If I would've let him push it through then my opportunity would've been gone.

Nope, finite amount of satoshis. Just like there's a finite amount of btc. Satoshi is the smallest value a bitcoin can be divided too, which is also finite. This creates scarcity while leaving it divisible to use as a target of value. The fiat currencies have inflation because they are printed infinitely, mathematically you can't divide bitcoin infinitely. There are 100 million satoshis in 1 bitcoin, nothing more, nothing less. If bitcoin becomes worth more than 100 million dollars then a problem is created whe the smallest value of a bitcoin possible is over a dollar, meaning you can't buy anything under a dollar by then. But let's be honest, by then, what will even be worth a dollar?
