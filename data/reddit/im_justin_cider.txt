I don't think he was arguing that because a law can be both illegal and legal at the same time that therefore Ross never committed any crime. But to highlight the arbitrary nature of law. And to encourage us to look at the principles instead.
Ross created a system of great value to the public, Ross at some point was connected to the account DPR, the system he created facilitated illegal activity.
Should we be going after the CEO of google, because you can use it to download pirated material?

Nice ad hominem. Never been proven wrong. What's true is still what's true, even if you don't like it.

You can do that, (and granted it's not easy) but all you need to do is look for a woman with similar principles as yours, and start a family. Live by the values you wish to see in the world.

There is inherent malice in coercion, which is the necessary tool of the government.
When you say there will always be government, I think you mean hierarchy. and that's fine. I totally submit to the authority of my carpenter, or my architect e.t.c. even to leaders who claim to know the best way forward. But in a just world, we would do so voluntary.
We would be run by philosophers not politicians. And you are free to create your own society run by government with a monopoly on solutions, and if it turns out to be the best solution then hey, we'll all switch over. But governments are inefficient monolithic beasts, I fail to see how a government will out compete a free market. Just look at the explosion of bitcoin or the internet, to name two examples.

When I envision a successful society without government, I'm not saying it won't have any form of organisation or leadership, or to be any kind of chaotic system, but simply a voluntary one, where we are 'ruled' by good ideas and reason. The only thing you can't do is force someone to be 'good', but you can incentive and ostracize.
Let them form their barbaric systems of governance if they are so insistent on being ruled and ruling over others. Don't forget, the state is the greatest actor of violence in the world today.

If I suspect they might have heard of bitcoin, but really I have namecoin, I'm just going to say bitcoin, rather than start a new conversation on how namecoin and bitcoin are similar but different.
Same as if I think they have no clue about cryptocurrencies and I'm talking about the price of bitcoin, I'll just say stock.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:55:57
It's not that it's impossible, you just don't want to go off and create an insland with people whose sole connection is that they  have the private keys to some bitcoin

I enjoy the funny rollercoaster gif that occasionally pops up here and there. Genuinely useful for me.

Governance is the initiation of violence by one group of people in order to force another group of people to behave a certain way. (Behind every law is the threat of prison/death for non compliance).
Another system for preventing unwanted actions in a voluntary society could be to de-incentivise unwanted/immoral actions by not making them profitable to the individual actor.
Governments are the biggest murderers in the world by a staggering amount.
Don't forget, governments rely on our fear of each other to stay in business, so a little murder here and there by the common man (especially the lower class / poor man) is a good thing for governments as it creates stability.

I was agreeing with you. He being He wants assange to be a russian bot, because that would be the least disruptive to his narrative that he has in his head of how reality works.
Also, russian spy or not, the facts are the facts, he conviently overlooks that, again, because feels
Also, notice how you automatically became a shill to him, with 0 basis. Simply for providing a reflection that counters his narrative. He makes up the facts as he goes along.
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:56:02
Lol. The only shame is that you knee-jerk me onto the 'other side' simply for even hinting that the debate could be more complex than your black and white analysis.
This is why we're so divided I think, because the world is actually complex. Right, wrong, morality and ethics are not simple things, and people like you love to shove anyone who dares to even suggest there is an alternative to your preformed mainstream narrative onto the opposition camp.
Good luck finding happiness and satisfaction in life while being jacked up on moral indignation and fight or flight response.

Don't worry, he insinuated that with this:

He's a smart guy that saw into crypto currency trend well before others and had the fortitude to hold while the cries of bitcoin is dead were chanted. He just donated what was it, 50 million in dollars? I'm sure he's doing fine ;)

Give me one argument that doesn't appeal to the aforementioned. I'm listening.
And the argument has to be sufficient to turn someone against supporting Trump. Not merely critiquing a single idea or policy as any idea or policy can be critiqued\*, nobody has the perfect political stance on everything. (as any state funded government will never be perfect for everyone).
\*I will accept a compendium of critiques, but ad hominems are not accepted

Would you have preferred the other liar?
@_date: 2017-02-07 15:20:41
woa, chill! Are you actually invested in wanting me to see the light, or are you now throwing your own temper tantrum because I'm not satisfying your ego as easily as you initially thought it would be?


I am unaware of this. Do you have any evidence for this claim? Politicians don't have a reputation for their honesty. Obama did a 360 on his hope and change rhetoric, Bush and his daddy before him we always knew were full of shit, we all know about Bill's lies, and Hillary's lies and are well documented, exhaustive, and criminal (lying under oath, deletion of subpoenaed emails, e.t.c.)
also, what is smdh?
@_date: 2017-02-07 15:00:29
No it's not, because we can't take the argument outside of any context.
You're applying a standard to Trump that you hold in total isolation, and probably don't even hold for yourself or any of your friends (as if you've never lied)
@_date: 2017-02-07 10:19:28
Probably ignored because it's a bum rush of loaded questions not asked through any curiosity but instead only to serve as a kind of 'gotcha!'.

All anti trump arguments appeal to emotion,  hatred and fear

Hey guys, I'm just a dude who got into crypto because it promised really cool things. I own both and honestly 'bcash' works great for me. Why the hate?
@_date: 2019-11-15 21:45:00
I really can't agree with point 3. From all my experience, all the name calling, shit talking, and general school yard style insulting happens towards BCH not vice versa
And point 5. We can just hold different opinions. You are no doubt better versed in bitcoin than i am, but... Changing the block size was Satoshi's originally proposed solution, sure, but even the core philosophy of bitcoin dictates we should be wary of going off-the-blockchain. I certainly am skeptical. And a look into the LN's funding doesn't help that skepticism either!
Your other points are certainly valid, but don't justify hate imo.
TBH i used to be a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, but honestly, now i just keep quiet about it. Bitcoin in its current state is not the salvation i thought was coming. I'm keeping my eyes out on the next generation of crypto.
@_date: 2017-01-27 09:16:18
I'd need to see one of these videos because while I'm not saying it didn't happen,  it's equally likely at this point that the video in question is subject to exactly the same devices.
I think you're right though.  This election has revealed something to the mainstream that some of us \*ahem\* have known for a long time,  that it's ALL bullshit!  We can't rely on any institution to blindly lead us; state; media or otherwise. Decentralize everything! Viva bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:16:12
Where's the evidence for your claim though?
@_date: 2017-01-26 18:33:24
Are there any examples going around?
@_date: 2017-01-27 10:13:31
Why do you seem to think I don't want to see it? I've displayed nothing but curiosity and consistently asked people to show me it. So far,  no one has been able to show me anything - except a diminishing reddit score for merely asking. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:33:09
Okay, so your meter of validity is whether it appeals to your senses?
