The point of donating to a charity is so someone else does the work of donating it to the final person for you. Of course less gets donated eventually due to the overhead.

Essiac does not work and you are harming people who would otherwise choose effective cancer treatment by suggesting it works.
"Essiac is an herbal remedy that was prescribed and promoted for about 50 years by Rene M. Caisse, a Canadian nurse who died in 1978. Shortly before her death, she turned over the formula and manufacturing rights to the Resperin Corporation, a Canadian company that has provided it to patients under a special agreement with Canadian health officials. Several reports state that the formula contains burdock, Indian rhubarb, sorrel, and slippery elm, but there may be additional ingredients. Essiac tea claimed to be Caisse's original formulation is also marketed in the United States. Several animal tests using samples of Essiac have shown no antitumor activity. Nor did a review of data on 86 patients performed by the Canadian federal health department during the early 1980s."

When chiropractors use spinal manipulation therapy for symptomatic relief of mechanical low back pain, they are employing an evidence-based method also used by physical therapists, doctors of osteopathy, and others.
There's no reason to go to a chiropractor instead of an actual doctor. At best, they will do the same thing an actual doctor would do.

I'm demonstrating that you can put anything.backup and it will come up with access denied.
cryptonumismatist is trying to suggest that gox has a document called insolvency-announcement.backup since that link show "access denied," implying a document exists for which to deny access.
cryptonumismatist's second link .any_other_url shows "not found" implying again that the insolvency announcement exists. My link demonstrates that it does not.

I know gold isn't actually infinitely divisible. I was exaggerating. 14 grams of gold is about equivalent in value to 1 BTC and 14 grams of gold contains about 43 sextillion atoms. So yeah, not quite infinite. But much more divisible than bitcoin is at the moment. How would making bitcoin as divisible as gold dilute the value of 1 BTC? That is my question.

That's a really good point I wouldn't have thought of.

The problem is that there are many things that can seem to help you that actually don't help in reality. Our senses and minds are easily fooled so we have to look at evidence to truly understand what is helpful and what is not.

Allowing smaller fractions of a coin  is not inflationary. Creating new coins is. There's a difference.

The question is will they be able to distinguish between actual treatment and pseudoscience in the chiropractic office? "If it works for my back let's see what they can do for my neck pain..." Besides, going to the chiropractor, even if the one you go to is only practicing science based techniques, is just supporting the pseudoscience of other chiropractors.

Can you ELI5? I read the paper but I must admit I don't have any background in finance and a lot went over my head. I still don't understand how splitting it would dilute the value of 1 bitcoin. Can we compare to gold? Gold is infinitely divisible.

Trezor has open source firmware, so before installing any update you can verify it yourself or wait until the community has verified it doesn't contain any changes that could steal your private key.

That's not how swap works. You can't swap 1 Litecoin for 1 bitcoin. Someone loses some btc and gains some ltc. At the same time someone gains some btc and loses some ltc. Like an exchange.

Buy as much as you can stand to hold on to when it drops 90% in value. If you put in $2,000 for 1BTC now and in 1 month it's only worth $200 and a year from now it's up to $300 you still need to hold on to it.

Selling something you don't have hoping the price goes down. If it goes up too much your bet gets called and you lose it all. If it goes down you make money. It's much riskier than buying and holding because it's difficult to lose all your money from buying but easy to lose all your money from shorting.

That's great you would have made that same choice. Many people would. Many other people wouldn't. The point is that it should be a person's own choice if they get circumcised. It's unethical to force it on someone.

The are only 1.635 million class a shares of Berkshire Hathaway. There will be 21 million bitcoins. That means if bitcoin was equal in value to Berkshire Hathaway, each bitcoin would be worth (.255\*1.635/21\*1000000)= $18,464

I don't see that as a problem. I can't think of any large purchases that I wouldn't wait at least an hour for anyway. And small purchases like mp3s and Steam games I don't see why the merchant couldn't just offer a 0 confirmation download. It shouldn't be much more risk than accepting credit cards, right?
