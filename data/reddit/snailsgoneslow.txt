Im not sure. Sometimes I tip in there because you know, I appreciate *art*. I think most users tip for this because they love to follow certain accounts and show they appreciate the photos/videos they make. Same reason that makes sites like chaturbate go round and round. Someone has to pay for the free pornography!

Mooncoin exists :"p +10 moons  @_date: 2014-02-04 16:41:07
Mooncoin is told to be a scamcoin. Devs try to cash out early. But it doesnt make the coin less fun. Have some more :"p +10 moons

So we are in the same boat. *yeah!*

I wish you goodluck. I look forward for more posts of you that could be submitted to this subreddit. This is the kind of people r/bitcoin needs. Strong facts, and a clear vision on what is needed and is done. Ps: that comment about no job, did you look back into my commenthistory? I made a post a while back ago that showed how my life is, and im curious if this is what made you post that. Just curious,im wondering if that post gives me negative feedback in my current submissions.

I want to submit this to to be honest. I laughed so hard.

Read carefully. It is a Trojan horse.

If it doesnt show usd value the bot cant retrieve the value in time haha. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:03:56
Good point! But I rather pay then visit malicious sites to be honest. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:51:03
Ahahhaha. Even funnier you can tip even lower with the bitcointipbot. 5 doge is the minimum for dogetipping. With the bitcointip you can tip even lower amounts.

You tipped the verificationbot :") and rereading my comment I saw I looked like an ass. My apologies! Btw, mooncoin is indeed worth nothing. Literally nothing since its a scamcoin. But it is funny to throw around while trying to add something to the conversation.

They should know this was going to happen...

Almost enough to make apple give zero fucks.

Sweet. Might come in handy later.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:14:54
Im sorry for you. If it makes you feel better, I cant find a wallet with about 5 Bitcoins back /:
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:50:51

@_date: 2013-12-01 22:31:31
Well.. arent you a special snowflake!
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:09:59
Awesome for reaching out!
