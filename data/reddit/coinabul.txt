You know what the technological world thinks of music labels and the record industry? Backwards. Always trying to backtrack to the era of cds and tapes.
Be the first music label that actually takes steps forward technologically and, by cutting fees, help support your artists more. 
Plus you could do so many cool new things with Bitcoin! Some sort of pay per second music player: "Pay .001cents for every second you listen to." A lot of other things you could play around with with micropayments.

Ah, so all those radio ads he spent money on? Bad for Bitcoin. The freaking highway banner? That's bad for Bitcoin too. The fact that the man doesn't have an off switch and attempts to convert waitresses, shop owners, and even random strangers everyday to using Bitcoin is totally bad for Bitcoin.

Keep in mind that the inadequate documentation is to help protect new traders from losing money. Trading with leverage is challenging and as such it is extremely difficult to gain money. You are much more likely to lose money. Unless you are confident in your abilities as a trader, I would not suggest using Bitcoinica. 
If you would like to become a competent trader, try trading fake money on the forex markets first. (There are some web apps out there that let you.) The forex markets aren't as volatile and the better documented forex apps will help explain all the fundamentals.

Not exactly! Bitcoin's value is not fixed on anything. You *can* buy gold on Coinabul.com with Bitcoin, but there is nothing to keep how much gold you get per BTC constant. The price of Bitcoin varies based on the demand for bitcoins.

In other news, perhaps this is a good marketing strategy. Imply, subtly, through multiple occurrences like this, that Bitcoin is something equivalent to wealth. Subconsciously implant the suggestion so when fiat fails, Bitcoin is the new way to represent wealth.
@_date: 2012-09-25 18:30:59
This is a valid question! Don't downvote him for asking a question that a lot of people ask. To answer your question: I like to think of Bitcoin as akin to bank wire. Sure, you don't use bank wires to buy your groceries, but it still has a valid place in the global economy. Bitcoin is an alternative way to transfer value internationally for less fees. That is a pretty valuable imo.

@_date: 2012-04-30 08:01:43
Here's a little newbie list I made:
Bitcoin: Online Money
Blockchain: A list of all Bitcoin transactions that have occurred. 
Block: a segment of the Blockchain. New blocks are mined every 15 minutes.
Bitcoin Wallet: A Bitcoin Client, or program, that stores your bitcoins and provides Bitcoin addresses.
Satoshi Nakamoto: Creator of Bitcoin
A Satoshi: 0.00000001 bitcoins.
Bitcent: .01 bitcoin
Silkroad: An online drug marketplace run on the tor network.
Bitcoin Address: A series of numbers and letters that acts as a receiving address for bitcoins. Bitcoin Addresses start with a one. Other forks have different beginning characters. Example Bitcoin Address: 1FFp9HQ3TvoUEMTmULqkQg3J1mVVbYnceH
Fiat Currency: A currency created by a government with no physical backing. In essence, a promise of value. 
Confirmations on the Bitcoin Network: In essence this means how many blocks a transaction has existed for. A secure amount of time to wait until a doublespend becomes impossible is 6 confirmations or one hour.
Doublespend: An attempt to fraudulently spend a bitcoin twice.
Blockchain Forks: These Blockchain forks or simply, forks, are projects that have in essence copied the Bitcoin source code and changed the code slightly. Notable forks include Namecoin, Solidcoin, ixCoin, and CosbyCoin.
Bitcoin Miner: A computer that is donating processing power to the Bitcoin network in exchange for a Bitcoin block reward.

@_date: 2012-11-20 13:38:39
From looking at the marketplace. It's way too hard to get money in and money out. And no, I'm only a statist by need.
EDIT: Don't get me wrong here. I do support a free market. I do think the war on drugs is insane. But for Bitcoin to gain widespread adoption, less emphasis needs to be placed on the political ideals (which appeal to a small number) and more emphasis needs to placed on the features of Bitcoin that make it better than processors and banks. (Which should appeal to everyone.)

Should I write the guy a 40 page paper explaining the intricacies of Bitcoin? This is one of the reasons that Bitcoin is having a hard time getting adopted by more users.

If you have questions about Bitcoin Friday, here's a brief summary: 
Bitcoin Friday is an event to celebrate the Bitcoin economy and the consumers that hold it up. This November 9th, 2012 the Bitcoin stores on this site will hold massive sales on merchandise avaliable for purchase with Bitcoin. 
This is a Pre-Black Friday of sorts. A one day sale event at all Bitcoin merchants along with a unified attempt at advertising Bitcoin businesses.

False, false, and false. Precedent has proven that anything of value being used to "gamble" (loosely defined for poker) is illegal without proper licensing.

You asked, and I deliver!
(It's on the blog post now too.)
Jon: Do you think the lack of arbitration (unregulated name squatting) is a fair compromise for decentralization? It may stunt the growth of Namecoin as corporations would avoid adopting it if they couldn’t protect their trademarks.
Khalahan:Namecoin used as a DNS, for example, is not a darknet, so people building standard websites on it are not hidden in the blockchain. So, you can’t do whatever you want with no risk at all, but, at least, you really control the domain name, the top of the chain. 
Khalahan: Lack of arbitration is the only way to assure a real decentralization. So, even if it’s not perfectly suited to all usages, this will greatly benefit to usages that don’t care about arbitration, and still benefit to other usages. Intellectual property/trademarks/patents had taken too much power, so, if Namecoin could balance all that, it’s a good thing.
Jon: What uses do you think Namecoin has an initial advantage on? I can imagine ad hoc name resolution may help.
Khalahan: Of course, domains that can’t be seized are interesting for a lot of people, but there also other areas where Namecoin can be useful: trust, identity, login, secured communication, etc. Things are not still defined on how all this will work, but Namecoin can be combined with existing softwares like GPG, user registration on internet (like the deprecated xup files) which would allow you to update your email address on all compatible websites your are registered on by just updating your email address in Namecoin. 
Also, bitcoin and other chains could use alias instead of public coin addresses (see  and 
Jon: Thoughts on botnets using Namecoin as a bootstrap?
Khalahan: This is an interesting use case that will be exploited in the namecoin python frontend i’m working on (ok, a derivative one). 
For botnets, they could bootstrap namecoin with well know nodes, download the chain or only specific blocks to grab some ip and then ? Is there a real benefit for the zombie computer to use this instead of connecting to an IRC channel or else ? Updatable ip ? It may be less complex to get ip from hacked computers all over the world or to build a p2p botnet. 
As each thing that provide power to its user, i can be used in a bad or good way (as knifes, secured communication softwares, etc).
Jon: What work is being done to investigate ways of storing and compressing the namecoin blockchain? Bitcoin’s developers are looking into exotic tree structures and so forth, how might these be applied to Namecoin and what technical challenges are there?
Khalahan: Namecoin community of developers is not big enough to spend time on this while we can (and should) all work on this in Bitcoin, because Namecoin share exactly the same problems as Bitcoin. Then, Namecoin will benefit from Bitcoin improvements. 
The specific technical challenge for Namecoin is to allow it’s usage as a light node where you only want last 36’000 blocks, or even only the registered names still valid (not all tx from last 36k blocks) with still proof of work benefit. But this is not a required thing today.

It depends on what games you offer. The laws encompassing online gambling are painfully imprecise.
The U.S. is getting slightly more accepting on online gambling, but I wouldn't risk hosting a site there.
@_date: 2012-12-21 13:12:17
You shouldn't trust them! You also shouldn't trust your own security measures. There should be no blind trust anywhere. Investigate Blockchain's security (which is pretty much the best available security for an online wallet) and see if it is adequate for your needs. Seeing as you're seeking security, not ease of use, I'd suggest a downloadable client.

What I WOULD like to see though... is for to join in on this Donation scheme... Here's the idea... You can donate a certain $ amount to the subreddit with your credit card, half of those funds would go towards marketing Bitcoin while the other half would be returned to you after a certain amount to days as BTC. Essentially allowing newbies to both enter Bitcoin easily, and support the Bitcoin community at the same time. Just a thought :)

Is this Bitcoin related?
@_date: 2012-05-21 20:27:38
I have yet to see a dragon cop up some coins for a startup investment. I think the reason is multi-faceted. Bitcoin is still way too small of an economy. Any returns on said investment would be very limited. Plus you'd have to invest in multiple, multiple startups like angels and VCs. I've considered reaching out to the dragons (since I've managed a lot of BTC projects and worked with a lot of USD-based startups), but I think Bitcoin still needs time.
And there's another factor to consider... Like the other dragons of old, some people don't even think the Bitcoin dragons exist...

Unfortunately, spot price drifts farther from the cost of bars or rounds as you go smaller in denomination. In general, bars tend to be cheaper while rounds tend to hold a premium since they're prettier. 
In addition, there's a production cost for mints associated with bars and rounds that's not seen in the raw product marketplace where the price of gold is set. Primarily the cost of production includes minting, warehousing, insuring, and delivery from the mint although other factors can come into play such as taxes, customs, etc. 
If you're buying bars of 10 ounces or more, you can get closer to within spot price, although usually that isn't possible until you get into 100 or 400oz bars.

You might be more interested in our API then. It allows you to essentially place orders for gold/silver from any website/webapp you make. P.S. If you need a custom banner or anything for the Affiliate program, let me know!

Hello Anon515,
We're having a conversation with the lawyers and making the TOS a little softer later this week.
Our support phone number is going up on the website in a couple of days, but if you want it now: 321-222-4478.
David, Jay, and I (My name is Jon.) are the fellows behind the site. 
This site is not a fly-by-night operation. We've spent months preparing the server, dealing with lawyers, and setting everything up. 
If you have any other questions, please let me know!
@_date: 2011-11-17 11:33:53
What would you like to see in said webshop? The problem with providing things that people use everyday is that not many want to order those things online.

Not at all. I advocate its use instead of bank wires.


Coinbase isn't charging 5% fees is it?
@_date: 2013-01-07 00:43:58
Gold Krug: 131.7429BTC, or $1,775.4069. APMEX Krug: $1,723.29	or $1,774.99. 
Difference: $1,775 - $1,723.29 = $51.71 which is a 2-3% difference. 
Of course you can't do a bank wire for under $2000 at most sites. So it's really a $1 difference :)
We're not really competing with local stores, those local stores beat everyone's online pricing (or they should).
Anyways, we're still a small company, as we grow our prices will go down.

In terms of phone calls, whenever there's a missed call and we see it, we return it. We get additional notifications when you leave us a voicemail, and will always do get back to you if we see that you tried to contact us. Sadly phones can be less than easy to work with: today I repeatedly tried to call back a missed caller only hours after they called, who hadn't left any voicemail, but got nothing except number-disconnected messages: sometimes wires get crossed despite our best efforts. 
If there's something happening on our end with outbound emails, I appreciate you bringing it to our attention. To that end, I just went through and double-checked: every single support email which has come in within the last week has recieved a response. Have you checked your spam filter?
Please do let me know if this was the case, but also private message me your email address as well as phone number so I can make sure that we did try to get back to you. This will help us verify that your email has both been recieved and replied to in order to help us make sure something isn't going on with the email system on our end. I don't like anyone to feel forgotten about, but occasionally things slip through the cracks or we have problems reaching our customers. We get a HUGE number of emails and phone calls every day and we always try to make sure each concern is addressed, so your help in making sure that we do so is appreciated.

I just resent my last email to you. 
An excerpt addressing your concern about password hashing for anyone else:
"As far as the copy of your password emailed to you, that's sent while it's in ram temporarily before it is hashed and stored. This is Bitcoin for goodness' sake, we have to be security-conscious to extreme degrees. We're VERY conscious of information security procedures here in order to make sure your private information is protected 100%. I obviously can't get into specifics too heavily as part of those same security procedures, but rest assured that we are absolutely not storing your password in plaintext, heh."
Regarding the "deactivated" phone message, now that I know who you are and can backtrace everything, I actually verified that I did try to call you on Friday and you were the number I couldn't connect to. We got your call on 3/29/13 at 1:46 PM, and I tried you back twice at 4:34 PM once I saw that your call had come in. Hopefully that clears up some of your concern, although you may want to check your phone connectivity since I couldn't reach you despite trying a couple times.
Let me know via email if you have any more questions,

International customs can be a real nightmare. Could you email our contact@ address with your order number so I can look into this? I'd really like to find out which destinations are taking 5 months to clear shipments to our customers, that's absolutely horrendous. 
Thanks very much for bringing this to our attention. If anyone else has experienced a similar customs headache with extreme delays on any of our shipments, please let us know about your experience. Please include in your email to us: 
1. Your order number, if you still have it available conveniently
2. The country your shipment went to
3. The length of time after you recieved a shipment notification from us that your customs office held your shipment
4. Any feedback your local customs office gave you
All of this will help us streamline our customs interfacing process to make sure that any procedures able to cut down on international clearance times are in place. Your help in streamlining our global operations is highly appreciated, thanks again!
