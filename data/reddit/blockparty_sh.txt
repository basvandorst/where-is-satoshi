It's fine if you think it's nonsense. I hope Bitcoin succeeds at being digital gold.

That site shows BTC as default which is 44% of blocks mined using ASICBOOST vs BCH's 50% for ASICBOOST.

None of that is true. The Bitcoin Cash developer found and reported an inflation bug introduced by the Bitcoin Core development team, one of the worst bugs in bitcoins history... he did a writeup on it [here]( Also 1gb blocks have been tested and run on testnet by the Bitcoin Unlimited team. Flowee the Hub has managed to get their node to do a full sync in 3 hours (normally this takes at least a day). Joannes Vermorel made CashDB which can process 20,000 transactions per second (UTXO database optimization). Schnorr signatures implemented by Mark Lundeberg and Bitcoin ABC. Very nice and easy to use software libraries for building products on top of Bitcoin Cash like BitDB and Bitsocket which make it trivial for people to create on-chain applications, and a burgeoning token system which works completely on chain and inherits all of Bitcoins great properties and scripting capability. There's more but this is turning into a wall of text... that adage about the amount of effort to refute bullshit certainly is true.

That's BSV. As far as I can tell they did not do any (or incredibly minimal) engineering to enable larger blocks. Also, 1gb blocks probably aren't ready on BCH either even if they've been demonstrated.. hence why they were done on testnet rather than mainnet lol.

This is great advice for people who don't use Bitcoin.

Your transaction wont be relayed if it is over 100kb, so you can do around 1400 outputs per tx.

For a little while with Bitpay the [minimum payment they'd process was $100 or more]( which is almost exactly the opposite problem lol.

The 1958 test at first went smoothly, but then BofA panicked when it confirmed rumors that another bank was about to initiate its own drop in San Francisco, BofA's home market. By March 1959, drops began in San Francisco and Sacramento; by June, BofA was dropping cards in Los Angeles; by October, the entire state had been saturated with over 2 million credit cards, and BankAmericard was being accepted by 20,000 merchants.
