This just hit me today - after I officially joined the 100-bagger club - we're not buying another currency, we're all contributing to a global account that each of us can withdraw from or deposit into. Bitcoin won't stop until we can each confidently travel the globe and liquidate cash anywhere we want to.  Putting a target of $200B in the global pot to make that network work, is not even crazy talk.  We've got a 20-bagger from here.  BTCs will be $20K, and LTCs will be $6K each.
tl;dr BTC and LTC are still cheap.

Even racists can buy bitcoin.  Pay no attention.

Whoops, I meant 10. been a long day. you're right, it's 10.

I really like the "think of it as change" ad.

I didn't say it was bad. Bitpay has their place in the world, but so does Litecoin.

Peter is so out of touch.  Nobody walks around with $2500USD worth of gold in their wallet.  Those combi bars would be so annoying, and fragile.  Do the same with Silver and make the squares twice the size, then maybe it would all work.  Not gold.  Either way, you don't need a magnifying glass to see satoshi.

The 1-800 number at the end is what does it in.

bitpay charges a fee.

I'm in the same boat.  I'm just not going to bid something up prior to it passing say $100M.  Sub $100M is too easy to be scammed / pump-n-dump.  Any true competition to Bitcoin, won't go from $1M to $1B in money stock, without giving me a chance to buy in, in the $200M range.

This works, until volatility drops significantly.

They confirm faster.  The target is 2.5 minutes per, rather than BTC's 10.  This might not seem like much, but if you're a restaurant with 20 tables, and want the security of a single confirmation, then the turnover rate is say 62.5 mins per table, vs 70 mins per with BTC, then that means you can serve 153.6 tables per 8h day with litecoin, as opposed to 137.2 with bitcoin.
Edit: BTC's confirmation time is 10 minutes, not 6...I knew that, no explanation for the brain fart.

I don't think it's worth 1/4, I think it's worth more than 1/4 - and it's a long run target.    There are 4x as much, but they are genuinely superior. Hence, &gt; 1/4. Getting the first merchants to accept BTC is much harder, than for a merchant to add a second alt-coin.   We're still in round one for both.  I've seen many technology companies leap frog each other.  This is no different.

These three pieces were inspired by Bitcoin, after I got my first full coin. Everybody always thinks the green one is Money...then I explain them Bitcoin.  Yes, I AM fun at parties.
