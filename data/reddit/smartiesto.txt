Take out loan to buy and repay the loan with what you were planning to put in over x span of time. I advanced one year worth of my rental income and bought all at one time. I am now just paying the loan back one month at a time, the unrealized gains is already more than the total interest I would have to pay over the next year. This plan is risky, however you can hedge your risk of falling prices by buying futures.

It's a BTC ETF - Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust; GBTC description from Seeking Alpha -"Bitcoin Investment Trust is a private, open-ended trust that is invested exclusively in bitcoin and derives its value solely from the price of bitcoin. It enables investors to gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin without the challenge of buying, storing, and safekeeping bitcoins. The BIT's sponsor is Grayscale Investments, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group. Each BIT share represented ownership of 0.1 bitcoins initially. The trust will not generate any income and regularly sells/distributes bitcoins to pay for its ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of bitcoin represented by each share gradually declines over time."
I had my shoulda woulda coulda moment with this one. Only if I had purchased some for my Roth-IRA. *sigh*
