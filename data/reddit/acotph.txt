Goxbucks...  It's near impossible (from my understanding) to actually withdraw the fiat you sell your bitcoins for through MtGox.  So people end up selling their BTC, having fiat sit in their account, only to rebuy at a higher price.  That's why Gox price has been higher than bitstamp recently.
It's not official until it's on bitstamp since you can cash your USD out through bitstamp, unlike Gox :)
The $7m wall are the outstanding orders in the bitstamp order book.  So some volume is going to have to move before we can get to $1000 over there

I decided to go this route since I'm looking to buy a handful of bitcoins, thanks!

To elaborate
From my understanding, which is very vague, the investment into mining hardware will never (or take a stupidly long time) to make any substantial return on that initial investment due to the size of the network.
Correct me if I'm wrong?

That would be pretty cool, like integrating bitcoin into kickstarter :)

Make a meme, that will help.

Hey, are you using VoS?  I dont' have any experience with wire transfer, I ended up doing a cash deposit.  And it was almost instant.
On a side note, the longest I've ever waited for a response was 6 hours.  
Best of luck!

People on this sub don't track the current price of bitcoin, you're delusional.
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:30:23
Exactly.  Be the change you want to see.

At $1200 i tranferred 4btc into my bitstamp account and was ready to sell, to rebuy when this happened.  Chickened out...
Holding.
