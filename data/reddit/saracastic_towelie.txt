Mainly from how the market behaved near the time of the last futures buying contracts expiry date. Just look at the graphs of how conveniently the price dropped just prior to that contract expiry date and the price just miraculously shot up just after the expiry.

Because that is the price theyll be buying the futures contracts at... so the lower the price at expiry of buying the futures the better it is for them... meaning  when they sell this contract at the expiry of it,  which i believe will be in april for these ones, the more the price is at that time from the price they buy at the more money theyll make on the contract...

It is the ultimate irony that Bitcoin itself would become the subject of a centralized, censored, governed approach.
When transactions cost an average $5 USD, one can’t help but scratch their heads and think, where did we go wrong? Why would the ‘leadership’ let things get this bad? What’s the motive here?
Elitist attitudes know no boundaries in the interest of self-preservation. Bitcoin is a threat. But every threat is also an opportunity to exploit. The development team has been hijacked, and the original developers (such as Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn) have over time been weeded out to make way for a team of developers, bloggers, and social manipulators who have blinkers on, and are of one thought. The blocksize must not increase. Let it be made known, that the Core developers refused any action on the Blocksize, well before Segwit was even on the horizon.
It is no secret that AXA Strategic Ventures of the Bilderberg Group has significantly helped fund millions of dollars into Blockstream. Blockstream’s $76m funding over two investment rounds were on the basis that it produces a host of off-chain solutions, some working on private chains, some on public, and some centralized solutions. By funding Bitcoin’s development on this level, it forces Bitcoin’s future down a centralized path, that is; activating Segwit for second layer solutions, one that Blockstream would have more control over, and one which would be more closely aligned to elitist interests.
The problem with having a development team funded to achieve one purpose is that there is literally zero room to move. There can be no negotiation, no debate, and no compromise. Because any compromise could potentially mean the purpose of funding is not satisfied. If Blockstream are not able to get their funding purpose into fruition (activating Segwit), then their organisation no longer serves the purpose of the elites, and will no longer be funded.
Fundamentally, Bitcoin is a competitor to MasterCard. Read that again, and then think about it again. Bitcoin in its original purpose was a peer-to-peer payment system. It provides you with the ability to transmit value over the internet, almost instantly, at hardly any cost, without any third party involvement. This is absolutely a threat to MasterCard, and to VISA, paypal, Western Union, and the rest of them. Why would MasterCard want to fund this? Beacuse by restricting Bitcoin to a settlement system, it is no longer in competition with any of these. So now you are getting the picture. " &lt; - Source:

do USDT deposits from Tether account usually take the same amount of time to show up on poloniex account as well? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:30:37
It's over. There is no fork happening. BIP 91 is locked in. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:19:37
The system is shaking in its boots... They fear this technology.  
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:47:59
They are all just fake threats... Nothing will happen, it's all FUD.

Actually I'd feel more comfortable as an investor if they said bitcoin would crash...

You may be right but it does make me wonder why are the Core developers so against a simple solution of increasing the blocksize? Doing so would not be against the original principals laid out by Satoshi or am I missing something?  
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:44:02
It took only 30mins for BTC coins to show up in account on poloniex exchange. Does it take the same amount of time if I sent USDT from my tether account to my poloniex account aswell?

I don't think that it would be an unreasonable demand if the problem is rather that blocksize increase should not be rushed rather than complete opposition to the idea of increasing the blocksize permanently. I maybe misinformed but from whatever information I have come across, it seems like the core developers are in complete opposition of any blocksize increase.  
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:51:04
I am just a neutral observer. I do not find anything unreasonable with the demand to increase the blocksize. To me Segwit seems like something forced down everyone's throat. I mean I would understand opposition to increasing the blocksize if it was against the original principals laid out by Satoshi.

"Founded in 2014, Bitcoin Core is funded by Blockstream, a technology company led by Adam Back and Gregory Maxwell. The stance of the leadership of this company is that the blocksize must not increase under any condition. Nor is the topic of blocksize increase even open for discussion. "

So you think all the disagreements and differences of opinions among developers and miners just magically disappeared all of a sudden? I mean seriously how can anyone say that something will never 'ever' happen again?  
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:20:02
what about poloniex? Is that a good exchange to use? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:05:43
only reason i'd like to get BCC is so i have the opportunity to sell it to buy more BTC from that amount...
