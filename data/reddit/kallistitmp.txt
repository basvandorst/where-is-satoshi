Long term your best bet is probably going to be BTC, ETH, or possibly Monero. Most altcoins such as XRP are just gimmicks, and don't have anywhere near the adoption potential of BTC. BTC is the best established, ETH and Monero are newer but each of them do have special capabilities beyond what bitcoin can do, and thus could potentially be a good investment in the future.

You could do an analysis of how often coins move between wallets, and use that data to determine which coins are *unlikely* to move again. Like, if 90% of coins move at least once every 6 months, you could conclude that the ones that haven't moved in 12 months probably never will. Oversimplification, but it could probably be done with a reasonable amount of certainty - certainly, some coins are just in cold storage, but I imagine that would only account for a small portion of your sample set. Good enough for a broad overview of the market.
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:39:23
It entirely depends on the application. Sometimes shitty 50% accuracy is more than enough - for example, if you were trying to qualitatively determine whether the rate of loss is slowing as wallet technology becomes more user friendly. But you are correct in thinking that this data would be useless for any application that required any reasonable degree of quantitative accuracy.
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:41:10
Again, not perfect, but considering the sheer amount of data it's unlikely that you'd see any large spikes. Sure, *some* people will definitely move their coins a month or two after your "likely never gonna move again" point, but it's highly unlikely that there'll be enough people who do that to severely throw off your readings. That would be like everyone getting up tomorrow and deciding to sell their houses all at the same time. So, definitely take your findings with a grain of salt, expect them to be off by 10 or 20%, but you can certainly get a reasonably accurate ballpark figure that way.
@_date: 2015-12-23 18:55:47
We can't know it, we can **estimate** it. It is absolutely impossible to accurately determine how many coins will never move again. But with even a simplistic analysis such as this one, and a large dataset, you can, with some accuracy(10-30% or so), measure how many coins will *probably* never move again. You wouldn't want to take it as gospel truth, but it could still be useful data - for example, if you were wanting to determine the approximate rate at which coins are being lost forever.

Okay, I'm about to blow your mind here.
The stock market actually has a sort-of method to the madness.
Most stocks give *dividends*. That's a certain percentage of profit. So, say that company X has 100 shares of stock out there - after they pay all their expenses, any money that they have left over is profit that goes to the shareholders. Since they have 100 shares of stock, each share gets 1% of their excess profit.
The price of a stock, *in theory* is equal to the total amount of dividends that 1 share will pay out in the entire lifetime of the company. So, if everyone expects each share of company X to pay out $5 for 10 years before they go bankrupt, then each share of company X will be worth $50.
*In reality,* it's a little off, since 
A) No one knows for sure how company X will perform in the future.
B) The price also takes into account how much money you might have made by ditching your stock in company X and buying stock in company Y.
C) People are fucking crazy and tend to get overly optimistic or overly pessimistic, instead of making rational assessments of the future profitability of company X.
Not all companies pay dividends - in this case, the stock price is based on the speculation that some day, the company will change their mind and start paying dividends.
In terms of labor, it's simple - stock holders make money from whatever is left over after paying the workers and other expenses. As such, the stock price would actually go **down** if they payed workers more. What this works out to is that every company has stockholders pressuring them to pay workers the absolute minimum wage they can get away with - every penny that's taken from a worker's paycheck goes into company profits and is transferred to shareholders. Since the shareholders run the company, you can guess what happens.
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:33:29
Then that will reflect in the collected data. Instead of a bell curve that drops off to near zero at a distinct point, you'll get one that doesn't have a clear drop off point. If people move coins every 15 months, there'll probably be people that move them every 14 months, every 13 months, every 12 months, etc. You can still point out a point where most of the coins probably aren't gonna move anytime soon.
It's a shitty estimate, mind you - it's gonna be off by at least a few million dollars worth of bitcoin. All I'm saying is that it should give you a ballpark. And considering that there's no way to directly measure how many people have lost their wallets/passwords or unintentionally sent coins to random addresses, something like this is probably the best you're gonna get.

Take all wallets with at least two transactions. Chart the time elapsed between each transaction and the previous one. A bell curve should emerge. Use that bell curve to estimate where time between transactions approaches infinity.
Take a snapshot of all wallets at a given time. Find all wallets with no activity since before the predetermined time. Add up balances.
As I said before, this is a really messy way to do it, and you should take whatever reading you get with a huge grain of salt. But it should give you a rough estimate. Won't account for coins recently lost, or the rare cases where someone just lets coins sit for years at a time before getting them out, but the law of large numbers should help you out a bit.

This man knows what he's talking about.
As a millennial, I'll say (1) we all agree that popular music sucks, and (2) I doubt that the credit thing will become a problem for a few reasons:
A) Not buying stuff you can't afford is to the point that it's become a cultural value for millennials. Not necessarily because we've grown up in the ruins of a credit-based economy, but because it's just *not an option*. I know exactly one person in my generation that bought a car on credit - everyone else payed cash for an old beater, even though they surely could have gotten financed for a new or gently used vehicle. For most of us, it's just not even something we consider - the cash you have is the cash you can spend, simple as that. I'm not entirely sure why we think this way, but I imagine it has something to do with watching our parents suffer from the housing crash. We've grown up to witness Enron, the bailouts, the futility that was occupy wall street, and have since become the generation least likely to vote - not because we don't care, but because we've come to the point that we've just accepted that large corporations and banks own the government and are going to fuck us, and there's nothing we can do about it.
(b) The millenials that DO get into the whole borrowing money thing are sure to have a bad experience. Most people get into the whole borrowing money thing with credit cards - and rates are currently atrocious. It makes little sense to me, since rates on auto and home loans are amazing, but a 20% APR is pretty commonplace for credit cards these days. This increases the chance that newcomers to the credit game will get fucked, and make the wise decision to avoid credit purchases in the future.
(c) We're already up to our necks in student loan debt, which discourages further borrowing. A large portion of us decided to get a college education on borrowed money, since we viewed it as a possible escape from our abysmal financial situation. In a good economy, this would be a smart and responsible choice, but in the current economy many of us are discovering our degrees are all but useless in a business environment where entry level positions require 5 years experience. Meanwhile the banks are demanding we start payments despite the fact that we can't find profitable employment, so we're basically getting fucked. I'm involved in a Maker group, and I find it hilarious that the majority of us are working for less than a dollar an hour over minimum wage and building fucking robots in our spare time for fun.
I have a lot of hope for our generation. I think that we're all disappointed with the current institutions, and I think that we're slowly starting do do something about it. I see more and more of us starting businesses, and more and more of us pushing for responsible and sustainable business practices. No way to say for sure how this will all turn out, but I'm hopeful. Also, the above chart doesn't look nearly as atrocious when you put it on a log scale.
So TL;DR I don't think the millenials will be borrowing a lot of money any time soon.
EDIT: A prediction: The bubble won't explode, but it will die with a long, slow fart. Nearly all the speculative markets are overvalued, but there won't be a dramatic event that makes them crash. Instead, the price will fall as people slowly get disillusioned from slow but consistent lessening of profits. The only possible rough patch will be when the student loan market crashes, which will be bad but not nearly as bad as the housing crash.

Here's a few ideas, if you crack it you should be awesome and give my starving student ass a tip.
I'm going to make a few psychological assumptions. First, that this password is memorizable and can be generated using the phrase and a salt method simple enough to do in one's head.
Second, I assume no external dataset is required, so no large tables of character remappings.
Third, that the method does not rely on capitalizing every nth letter, and likely does not involve capitalization at all.
And fourth, that the password is restricted to keyboard characters, no numpad smiley faces.
So if these assumptions are true, we can break it down into two different approaches, word manipulation and character manipulation. Aka "reverse each word" vs "reverse the whole string".
My bets are on word manipulation, because of assumption 1. I would suggest looking for a uniform process of reordering the characters of each word, as it's unlikely a manipulation of capitalization or a downright letter substitution.
Try these manipulations -
(Single pass manipulations, herp-derp level of protection)
Reverse the word order 
Omit vowels
Retain word order but reverse word spelling
Reverse the whole damn passphrase
(Multi pass manipulations, easily brute forced)
Put N number of letters from the end of each word at the start of the word (sorta like pig Latin)
Reverse every other word
Shuffle word order
Replace all vowels with a specific character
Interleave the first and second parts, letter by letter.
Try all of the above with and without spaces.
Feel free to try these out if you can code them, should be pretty simple. Alternately OP could just gimme the coins if one of the above methods would crack it :)
EDIT: Oh, one more approach, the geographical one. Substitute each letter with the letter to the side/above/below it on the keyboard.

Not really. They're required to monitor your transactions, but once it's left for an unsuspicious wallet it's out of their hands. A good analogy is ATM's. Once you make an ATM withdrawl, the bank is not legally required to follow you around and see where you spend your cash. Also the design of tumblers is such that it's actually rather hard to identify a tumbler transaction, and even harder to trace the inputs and outputs. These are banks we're talking about, they only go far enough to meet legal requirements. Any deeper investigation costs money and doesn't do shit for the bank's profits. As such, the extent of their involvement is generally limited to "let's make sure that we don't get sued for john sending $20,000 to 
Don't get me wrong, I do think bitcoin is overhyped as the end all anti-tyranny tool, which it isn't - but it's by far the most secure way of transmitting funds out there. Not a deus ex machina but still a useful tool, if used intelligently.

In the sense that banks keep a certain percentage of cash on hand for withdrawals, and the rest of their assets rely on speculation of loans being paid. 50% cash on hand is enough to cover withdrawals under normal circumstances.

And while tiger direct and overstock did of course see dropoffs, it's still profitable for them if for no reason other than they don't have to pay card fees. If we see a long term decline in price and adoption I'll pronounce it dead, but like I said it's way too early to panic. Investors aren't going to write off their ATM's as a loss over a little drop like this. I think we all just need to keep in mind that just because bitcoin may not be all the golden god given answer to all our problems doesn't mean it's not gonna stick around. It's good tech, and it doesn't need to quadruple in price every month to still be a good investment or a useful invention. I'm conservatively optimistic in the long term.

She's making 40,000 a year, and while that's not filthy rich it's not destitute by any measure. She could afford health insurance if she actually wanted it. And considering that she got her school paid for and has used the fame to sell her paintings, I'd say she made off better than most Americans in her generation.

I mean, surviving bad news is not as good as a constant stream of good news, but it is good for long term stability. The SR shutdown made everyone proclaim the death of bitcoin, but when the dust settled and it was still standing that gave a lot of people enough trust in it to invest. When bitcoin survives the mt gox crash, it'll make people less likely to panic if there's, say, a problem with coinbase or bitstamp. That's why us old farts aren't panic selling over this drop.

Not really. The whole point of moving to bitcoin is to AVOID having to maintain a vault full of insecure paper slips. The problem isn't the dispensaries accepting payments, it's how to safely hold profits. The banks won't securely hold the profits generated by the business, and running an all cash business is like putting up a big "rob me" sign. A bitcoin wallet, on the other hand, could easily be made more secure than a bank vault. Encrypt a cold wallet private key, split encrypted key up into 5 sections, put each on a flash drive and put each flash drive into a safety deposit box in a different bank. Now stealing the money would require simultaneously robbing 5 bank vaults.

Didn't always think that way, learned that after making serious cash on pump and dumps. Zen over greed makes cash. Hindsight is 20/20, but it's generally not a good idea to turn up your nose at 200% profits in hopes of higher profits that may or not ever come.

Free market economics has been tested, many times. Shanghai free trade zone, the internet, and nearly the entire industrial revolution. And yes, the great depression was caused by stock price crashes in response to a bill passed to levy heavy tariffs on imports, thus  significantly lowering the projected profits of many different industries. Granted, there were other factors that snowballed after that, but that was the stick of dynamite that set it all off. The best economic manipulation has ever pulled off is a short term burst in production - in the long term, free markets always win.

Well, first off 3% is a huge deal to many merchants. In a low margin business this could nearly double profits. Second, transmission is far easier - ever try to send someone in another country some money? It's a pain. While most card features like charge backs have yet to be implemented well, they are possible and will likely happen at some point. Bitcoin requires less infrastructure compared to banks, and cannot be artificially manipulated. With the dollar, the government can just print more money. Not so with bitcoin. Finally, it's resistant to fractional reserve lending, the market manipulation tactics of banks, and forced seizure or regulation by governments. Oh, and some dude in his basement can keep his money safer than it would be in Fort Knox.

The NSA and other alphabet soup organizations can't hack or do IT.
The way they invade privacy requires basically no tech skills, just a lot of influence/muscle. For an example, look back at that case where they went to court trying to get apple to put a backdoor in iPhones so that they could unlock this cell phone.
That's their approach. Prism they just paid/threatened ISP's until they gave them full access to just tap the connections.
None of this has anything to do with maintaining an IT infrastructure. The government tries to do that the same way it does everything - with a complex corporate bidding system. Guess who wins those bids? Microsoft does, or other large corps. Then those corps get some vendor capture shit installed, so next year the question isn't "who do we pay to maintain our infrastructure" it's "who do we pay to maintain our shitty **Windows** infrastructure". 
It strongly inscentivises companies to set government agencies up with really shitty tech that's not compatible with anything and a giant expensive pain in the ass to replace. And nobody is gonna replace them, because no one is gonna campaign on "Vote for me and I'll modernize our IT infrastructure". As such, much of NASA is still running on Windows 2008. It's really that bad. IT security in government is so notoriously shitty that anytime they actually need something even semi secure, they have to use paper records in a safe somewhere, because that's the most sophisticated IT infrastructure they can actually figure out how to work with.

CTX4000: Tempest 2.0. The CIA is probably the only government agency with half decent hackers, so I can't say I'm all that surprised that they managed to piggyback over the same basic approach. It's a known thing, and while it's a bitch to protect against it's also a bitch to use. If you've pissed off the government bad enough for them to break that out, you've got a lot worse than losing your crypto to worry about. Also, it's entirely an analog attack, not all that sophisticated, just requires really sensitive radio equipment. Not anywhere close to trying to design and maintain a general use IT infrastructure for use by Karen the secretary.
Everything else is nothing but money and influence. Any script kiddie can write software to send encrypted Geo data, and you don't have to be a genius to make a surveillance chip - you can buy a cheap hardware keylogger for less than $20, and their chip really isn't much more sophisticated. The hard part isn't doing the technical side of the monitoring, it's threatening and/or bribing the company CTO to have their factories install that chip and getting away with it.
Think about how much that shit cost to develop too - probably in the mid billions, at least. Acceptable costs for mass surveillance programs and highly valuable political targets, nowhere near realistic for protecting Bob's social security number from secretary Karen's unwavering trust in the county password inspector.
Two totally different fields. Maintaining a secure system for large amounts of widely accessed data really doesn't equate at all to military espionage. Yes, if the government really wants your ass, they will get your crypto, but they can't (or won't, rather) protect your data for shit.

Just go totally fucking nuts. You'll probably double your money a couple times, and then loose it all.
You will come to realize that all speculative markets are gambling. You will come to realize than no one truly knows what the price is going to do next. You will realize that panic and greed and mass hysteria are drugs, and that people will waste fortunes because they're high on the game.

Just FYI, banks can't charge you an overdraft fee for a bank fee. Now, if you buy a pack of cigarettes while you're already negative by $8.39, then they absolutely can charge an overdraft fee - but they can't charge an overdraft fee just for getting a bank fee. Also, they can do funny things with posting order, so if you bought a pack of cigarettes while your account appeared to be positive, and they put the maintenance fee in an hour later, they can post the maintenance fee first and use that to assess a fee.
Also, you have the right to deny your bank the ability to charge you overdraft fees for everyday in-person debit card purchases and ATM withdrawals. It's part of Federal Regulation E. You can simply call up your bank, at any time, and tell them you want to Opt-Out of standard overdraft coverage as per Reg E. This instructs the bank to simply decline your card if the charge would put you negative - and, if the charge goes through anyway, they can't charge you a fee for it (though you will still be responsible for the negative balance). You can update your preference at any time. Again, this is federal regulation - all banks are required to follow this and get hefty fines if they don't.

I certainly agree that we shouldn't ignore the future - it's certainly possible that we could see a continued trend of exponential growth for the next few hundred years or more. What I'm saying is that it would be unwise to bet the entire future of a technology, especially one as important as bitcoin, on the assumption that the trend will continue.
And exponential growth is unsustainable by definition in this context - unless we discover something very unexpected about our universe, there is an upper limit to what's possible - no matter what we do, we'll never be able to make a transistor smaller than a quark, or send information faster than the speed of light (barring any discoveries that completely destroy our modern understanding of physics)

The exponential growth of information technology we've observed so far is just a pattern. It's not a law of physics or anything. The only reason that IT grows exponentially is because that's about how fast engineering companies have been able to develop it so far.
If there's an economic crash, that progress disappears. If we run into a hard limitation of physics, that progress disappears. If companies just quit bothering to fund new research for whatever reason, that progress disappears.
Exponential growth is, by definition, totally unsustainable. We've probably got a good little bit until we start hitting those upper limits, but we really can't bet the farm on the trend continuing - no one has any clue how much longer Moore's law is gonna hold out. Basing your plans on technology that doesn't exist yet is patently moronic - just ask all the people who expected we'd have cold fusion by the mid 90's.

Right, a value based analysis of the plastic bag is the only way to go. Volatility trading is just too risky, best to go for the long term profits by looking at the bag's characteristics, such as volume and the tensile strength of the material. Speculation can only go so far, at the end of the day what matters is if that bag can bring home the groceries.

Um, no, currencies reflect value. Creating value would be growing wheat, or grinding that wheat into flour, or making bread out of that flour. Currencies transfer value, not create it.


To be more precise, speculation is artificially raising the exchange rate. People hoarding lowers the supply, which raises the price, which causes artificial 'growth', which increases the demand. It can't go on forever.


Yes, people are dumb. Welcome to earth. Also, I'm not saying people should spend all their bitcoins, I'm saying that people should start both spending them and earning them from others. Just like dollars. We don't hoard dollars hoping to convert them to yen in the future. We earn them, save them, and spend them.
The biggest issue with bitcoin being used as only a savings account is that all it would take to topple the system would be one asshole in Washington regulating it. Say, ruling that all sales of bitcoin for USD are subject to 10% tax. If bitcoin is good for more than just mt. Gox and silk road, then it stands a better chance of not only surviving but helping to fix our useless centralized fiat monetary system.

On the contrary, it is a given. There is current and growing demand for technologies that make bitcoin more user friendly. Mt.

@_date: 2013-11-24 10:55:28


That argument is absurd. Bitcoins are fully divisible. Really, I expect the satoshi to eventually become the commonly used denomination, like the dollar is. Saying 800 is too much for a bitcoin is like saying a dollar isn't worth 100 yen. I mean, how could it be, there's 100 of them!


True, but changing. Also keep in mind it is currently the easiest way to send money between individuals. Far more convenient than western union or bank wire, and far less fees.


At the moment, sort of. It's volatile. Again, this is changing. Bitcoin prices will stabilize as we approach market cap. The reason the prices are unstable is because of extreme demand, which drives prices up quickly and makes people nervous.


Again, this is changing, which is the reason why you can buy cheap bitcoins now.


If major retailers accept bitcoin, employers will start paying in it, and banks will start running on the fly exchange systems. Which I believe someone is already working on.


For domestic transactions with large retailers, absolutely. For international transfers and individual transfers it makes sense. And eventually bitcoin will become widespread enough that converting bitcoin and fiat will either be unnecessary or absurdly simple.


LOOK AT THE CHART ON A LOG SCALE YOU NEANDERTHAL. Yeah, looks less scary now that a 10% increase takes up the same space no matter when it happens, huh?


Anonymous ish. Also totally unseizable and untaxable.


Yeah, if you wait for 20 friggin confirmations. And cumbersome? Hellen Keller could do it now days. Have you seen coinbase?


You mean like cash and gold? Fuck consumer protection. Consumers can protect themselves by choosing who to do business with. 'Consumer Protection' is just a buzzword for 'regulating the competition into the ground'. It's just a tactic monopolies use to drive out small businesses and startups.


So? Most banks are the same way. They just only show you the relevant transactions on your statement.

Which kind of comes back to point one: deflation causes spending. When your money is worth more than it was last week, you're more likely to spend it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:15:51
Fact: people don't think that far ahead. They think "can I afford this now". If they can, they get it. If not, they don't. If I have a lot of money, I will spend some of it. If I have a little money, and will have less tomorrow, I will try to desperately hold on to it. This may not make sense from a logical standpoint, but human psychology and behavior is not logic based. Not to mention most people in america are too stupid to even realize that money looses value. They all seem to think that everything they buy just magically raises in price periodically.

Poor kid here. I started out with $50 in bitcoins, after watching it go from about $1 to over $100. Figured what the hell, I spend that much a month on booze and smokes.
After a week I was hitting myself on the head for ONLY buying $50 worth. Put in another $300 or so, all I could afford. Only kept $100 or so in fiat. Took a little out here and there to pay expenses, and still had twice as much at the end of the month as I did at the beginning.
And before people denounce me as reckless, investing more than I could afford to loose, let me say that I've been living in poverty for quite some time. And when you only have a few hundred bucks to your name, and very limited income, the risk of loosing it all when your car breaks down is far higher than the risks involved in bitcoin. 
Even though i dismissed it as a cryptoanarchist pipe dream in it's early days, investing in bitcoin is quite possibly the best decision I have ever made.

Statement fees, maintainance fees, debit card fees, you haven't had enough fees fees, you add it all up and 4% is a fucking dream. And with bitcoin, the difference between buying now in person and 4-6 days later once your documents are reviewed is likely to be much more than 4%.

Your logic is flawed, because fiat can be converted to btc. If you decide to pay for a sandwich with $5 of cash instead of $5 worth of btc, that's still $5 you could have used to buy more bitcoins, which could have been worth $10 tomorrow. There is no difference in loss based on which one you spend, only based on how much of your money is stored in each form at any given time. So ideally, you'd store as much money as possible in btc, and only convert to fiat when absolutely necessary, because the 2-4 days it takes for the cash to land in your bank account is 2-4 days of lost profits.
TL;DR  it makes way more sense financially to buy everything you can using bitcoins.

Because the hearing was totally unpredictable. Yes, we've known about it for a while, but only to the extent that we knew the senator was open to it. There was still a very real chance that the DHS reps would have gone scare tactic and demanded immediate measures be taken, like coinvalidation or something. Since the US is a close second in the bitcoin market, news like that could destroy bitcoin. As such, people bailed right before the hearing just in case. Once that danger had passed, they bought back in.

THIS THIS THIS THIS.
This is why I am an anarcho-capitalist. The map of economic theory does not match the territory of actual economies, which are actually rather simple. Namely, an economy tends to work well so long as you DON'T FUCK WITH IT. Sure, it'll have a few bumps here and there, but it'll fix itself if you just leave it alone. Srsly.
Every issue is an untapped market with a value equal to the severity of the problem. When Americans started working 40 hour weeks and had less time to cook meals, we weren't saved by the government regulating work hours, we were saved by McDonald's. Right now banking and fiat currency are one of the biggest problems, which means that bitcoin has a hell of a lot of value. The only thing I can see stopping it at this point is the corrupt Citibank fanboys in congress who are actively profiting from the issue.

It will all more or less hinge on the American response - if the senators see this as an opportunity to take over the market now that China's out of the way, and encourage american exchanges, bitcoin will boom. If another country, say, Canada or Japan, takes the opportunity then bitcoin will continue. If no major countries take the opportunity then bitcoin will die as a result of too much friction. Bitcoin's value is based on its practical use as a method of payment. If you can't use it to legally buy things, and you can't legally or easily exchange it for fiat, it is worthless. While the govt may have no direct power to shut down bitcoin, they can certainly make it so much of a pain in the ass to use that it's no longer practical as a currency.

How is hyperdeflation bad? Rapid change does not mean bad. In this case, rapid change means an exponential expansion of the user base, and given a limited number of coins that will in turn cause an exponential rise in price. We're still in the early adoption phase, most people with bitcoins are enthusiasts. And since it's going to the moon, more people are climbing on the rocket. But most people are still either on the fence or haven't heard about it. Once everyone that's gonna get on is on, the price will stop rising so quickly, and reach an equilibrium where it slowly deflates inversely proportional to population growth.

The North Dakota senator hit it RIGHT ON THE HEAD with her talk about truth in advertising. We don't need or want 'consumer protection' or for the government to 'protect investors' from volatility. Leave us the fuck alone, we know the risks and we can handle them ourselves. We don't need a nanny state to regulate and protect us from our own decisions, and that's the whole point of bitcoins.

Uhhh, I'm just an armchair investor, but I think the man has instability and volatility confused. Bitcoin is great because it has a strong, stable long term trend, and crazy, volatile short term characteristics. It might drop 25% in 10 minutes, but it always recovers and resumes the climb within a day or two. Hard to find both of those characteristics in a single investment - strong trend for fundamental trading, high volatility for technical trading. Best of both worlds.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:53:29
I did switch to a credit union. While I do think 4% is a little high in the long term, for a low volume niche market that's pretty reasonable. If they start processing billions a day, then yes, that would be outrageous. Also no transaction fees on bitcoins - you don't see those on your statement because they're on the business's end, but those typically are 3-5% for every card transaction.
