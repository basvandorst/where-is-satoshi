Still learning how to do it really my first account was with MT GOX so....a little scared.

If only we were business partner! Keep trucking with Amazon it's a crazy monster if you can figure it out. I have a friend doing 50k a day net!!! 
And sorry for writing such a cocky stupid reply it was in a moment of rage! I guess my point is money doesn't make you happy and there's never enough so focus on what you love!
I understand the tech but honestly still think crypto will all implode.

HA! Ya definitely. You'd feel rich but you'd need to be careful. In an ideal world you find some sort of work/business that keeps you engaged and generates your living / spending money and then use the returns from the investment for toys and travel etc. Either way, I hope you get there someday soon!

So $6.3M USD is not rich?

You can live a pretty good life with $315k though at 5% a year redemption. There are also only like 2.5m people in the world with net worth of this range so you're doing pretty well. Not elite. But I'd say you are independently wealthy at this stage.

Yes I often look at some of the largest BTC wallets and I'm amazed at some of them wtb $75m USD value that haven't made a trade in 7 years. I assume some guy lost his cars or something.

They are doing private label leggings I think. This was during their holiday season a few years ago I'd be surprised if t was that good still as Amazon tends to screw you over once you nail a trend. Have heard a few horror stories of businesses going from $50m a year to zero overnight if Amazon gets into the same product on their own brand. I guess that's the cost of doing business!
You make valid points. I believe in the tech I'm just hesitant to jump in after a crazy run I think I'll see if it does some consolidation. It's just a very hard product for me to value so hard to see if it's over valued of under valued. If it becomes the worlds currency well then clearly it's under valued right now.

I was looking at physical wallets for a while but they appear to be all sold out.

This is my story....but I made $7,500,000 CAD from my business in the last three years AND I STILL REGRET not buying BTC!! lol...Greed NEVER goes away. I have $5M in the bank and I'm mid thirties and it takes a LOT of mental energy to not feel really bad about missing the boat. My buddy and I look at threads we have about BTC in 2011 when it was $3....

Yes - the only commodity really is time. If you get your time back and get to do what you want then you have all you need. I feel very fortunate every day for what I have been able to achieve and I try to remind myself.
