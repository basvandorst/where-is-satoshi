thanks for the help but i've got a throttled bandwidth i think it takes a week or so just to download the blocks by the way he's got a running node so i guess it's already validated and when it's transfered to my machine i just need to sync with the new blocks added or i'm missing something here..

I think of it this way, as Bitcoin is considered the flagship of crypto world, many people tend to hold their assets in Bitcoin rather than any Altcoins. this is quite independent of Bitcoin price. However when Bitcoin goes down, it can mean faith in crypto has decreased, as a result most of Altcoins follow Bitcoin as well since more people begin to cash out. On the other hand a raise in Bitcoin price stimulates people to convert their holdings to Bitcoin for a bull run. anyway I think a stable Bitcoin price after a sudden run (bullish/bearish) makes an Alt Season very likely.
