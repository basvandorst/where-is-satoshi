I don't know either, I can't read korean. But I know South korea was always a good market for BTC (just look at charts). However, it was not the biggest, now it's the biggest, by far the biggest. If they keep investing to protect their money in case of war, they will pump BTC to the moon because the world will follow.

and then, they will blame Bitcoin for the crisis. We already know how the propaganda works.

You can call it a bubble, I call it mass adoption. It is just starting. Just one example, here in Brazil now there are people selling cows for Bitcoin. Here is one news from yesterday (in portuguese, you can translate with Google): 
Another thing, if you look at exchanges the volume is getting higher and higher. Facebook groups with massive amount of people asking how to buy and a lot of Youtube videos talking about cryptos on channels that are not even about money or investiments.

BCC on Bitfinex is Bitcoin Core, not Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Yes, It could be a bubble. However, the bubble stopped on the 'Media attention'.
For god sake, how the price will increase if almost all exchanges are overloaded and are not selling?
A lot of people here on Reddit complaining they can't buy.
Exchange's infrastructure fucked Bitcoin badly this time.
