This is not true, there is evidence and it didn't come from the corrupt cops, it came from Ulbricht's laptop where he kept notes about it and kept chat logs he had with the corrupt cops and his Bitcoin wallet where you can see the transactions for the hits.  This evidence was presented at his trial and is now a matter of public record.  It is a part of the body of evidence that convicted him.  Nice try though.

It was a part of the trial and the evidence presented covered multiple instances of him ordering a hit.  That evidence is a part of the body of evidence that convicted him.  He was not on trial for murder so he was not convicted of it and there was no need to try him for it since they had enough to put him away for life without making the trial more complicated.  To say it was never proven is disingenuous as there is proof that it happened.  There is evidence that you are turning a blind eye to because I assume you think propping up a bad person to fight an unjust war(the war on drugs) is acceptable.

It was introduced in court as evidence during his trial and he was convicted based on all evidence provided.  It is a matter of public record now and it doesn't matter if he was charged with it for people to make up their mind about his intentions.

So you're accusing me of fake outrage?  Is this some sort of attempt at an attack?  Because it's not very good.

I've watched it all and I followed the trial each day until the end.  The dude is guilty and he thought he was having people killed.
  
Intent is what matters to me and it weighs heavily on how I see a person.  I cannot support someone who is capable of killing people over money and he tried to kill people.  Corrupt agent extorting him for money or not, he thought he was killing people.  He could have chosen not to. 
  
I've tried to find redemption for him in other deeds and there is nothing redeeming about him.

It's been at least a couple months.  That label has nothing to do with bch.  They are trying to label what it is and "cash" is their label.  If you search "Bitcoin Cash" you'll see their label is "change".  I find it all very amusing.
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:41:57


What is there to doubt?  Seriously, I'd love to have some doubt without fabricating it on my own using conspiracy bullshit that has no evidence.  There is so much evidence he did it you need to come up with evidence to contradict it.
  
The multiple DPR theory has never had any merit to it.  There is zero evidence there was another DPR and we have both his logs and diaries that corroborate how he arrived at the persona.  Please convince me otherwise.

Any idea what the cost of running the site is per month?  That sounds like a lot of money but I don't know what the overhead is.  I feel like there should be a biding process where exchanges could bid to be a sponsored provider.
  
I do like how it clearly states it is sponsored because that at least tells me "they paid to be here" versus an endorsement from the community.
@_date: 2018-07-21 01:25:34
Your actions are questionable, gonzobon.  On one hand you demand strong evidence with your insistence that it is absent in the case of Ulbricht trying to kill people(it isn't) and on the other you offer up innuendo as if it is evidence(it's not).
  
@_date: 2018-07-21 01:16:26
Can you prove it's not his laptop?  No, you can't.  There is more evidence that it is his laptop than there it that it isn't(none).  You already told me last night that you didn't want to argue about this anymore and that I shouldn't trust the government.  I guess you still want to mislead people though.

joecoin is trying to mislead you.  There were a couple of corrupt agents working the SR case.  There were a lot of different departments and groups working on the SR case.  The corrupt agents did not work on the team that found and arrested Ross and they never had any access to his laptop.  Ulbrichts laptop was the nail in his coffin because he recorded everything and only used one layer of encryption.  When the arresting team snatched his laptop unencrypted from his hands in the SF public library, they had everything they needed at that moment.
It's a complicated case and I would encourage you to do your own research.  Ulbricht apologists like to muddy the waters with the corrupt agents while leaving out a lot of facts of the case to make Ulbricht look better and raise doubt in your mind that Ulbricht intended to kill people.  Ulbricht definitely thought he was killing people and even received evidence that at least one hit happened.  The evidence was fake but Ross didn't know that at the time.  He is no hero.
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:45:00
Ross Ulbricht is not a hero.  He didn't use his wealth to try and help anyone.  He used Bitcoin as a tool to get rich.  He built a centralized empire and he tried to kill people to defend it.  He is not even close to the type of person that we should call a hero.  Don't be his tool and set a better example for generations to come.

I think the result will be positive based on the "do no harm" sentiment coming from US regulators.  We can demonize cash and crypto all we want but at the end of the day the US government uses cash for influence around the world and they aren't about to cut off their own foot.  Crypto is just another tool for them.
@_date: 2018-07-20 03:36:59


  
It tells me he is ignoring the evidence and continuing to try and ride SR for profit.  After all, he now knows Ross was tricked into putting out the hit on him and he may think this gives him an in with his boss, DPR.  
  
He was not in any position to know anything one way or the other.
@_date: 2018-07-21 01:47:34


  
It's purpose was to show the lengths he was willing to go to protect his drug empire.  You seeing it as "them" trying to taint the trial is your bias.  You've already shown you don't trust "the government" by telling me not to trust "the government" last night.
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:05:32
I guarantee you that it is not gold plated.  I'm sure you want us to believe they are gold plated because you are asking $2 a piece for them and probably charging stupid shipping on top when I can buy them in bulk for less from alibaba.

Ron Paul is a national treasure as far as I am concerned.  If it was not for this man, I may not have seen the value proposition of Bitcoin as early as I did.  The man is a truth teller in a house of lies.

The reality is that you appear to be determined to go against "the media" no matter the evidence.  I'm basing my decisions not on "the media" but the judicial process and the discovery that happened during that process.
  
    
  
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:33:13
I'm curious.  Do you accept that he is DPR?  How do you reconcile the evidence?  **The evidence that was presented at his trial and was used to convict him**.  The hits were covered in detail and I know you followed the trial.  You were a stoner college kid back then.  Have you not grown and open your eyes at all since then?

He ran a drug empire and was a mob boss.  He had staff under him. He paid for hits on people(his own staff) in order to set examples for others who would steal from him.  He profited by taking a cut of each sale of illegal substances and actively evaded the law.  He knew what he was doing and maybe you should just let him take responsibility for his actions instead of trying to defend the indefensible.

I have not advocated for his sentence and only insisted that he should "take responsibility".  
@_date: 2018-07-20 03:32:50


  
Liar!  The evidence presented was his own words.  His own chat logs and his own diary that he kept.  The evidence is the Bitcoin transactions correlated with the event for the same amounts from his own wallet.  You have no evidence to back up any of your positions and choose to ignore the existing evidence.  You choose to believe a complete conspiracy over the evidence.  People like that are sometimes labeled a "conspiratard".
  


  
He was a new kind of mob boss but he was a mob boss.  He had an illicit empire with employees.  He had confidants with administrative powers granted by him and he tried to kill people under him that he believed had stolen from him.
  


  
Sorry your boy didn't get off because of a couple of corrupt agents.  Thankfully they weren't working with the arresting office and were insulated enough to not matter in the end.  At the end of it all, I have to thank them for exposing Ross for the type of person he really was so that good people didn't get duped into supporting him.
@_date: 2018-07-21 01:06:39
There is evidence he tried to kill people so not really non-violent.  He has violent intent.  Whether he knew it was a setup or not, he thought he was whacking people.  It really doesn't matter at this point if he was charged with it or not.  The evidence was presented at his trial and anyone who cares to look can see how Ross chose to take someones life to defend his empire.  It was actually multiple instances of him doing it.  He even received faked evidence of the hits and believed it had happened.  This is not someone you should be supporting.

He went down for being a drug kingpin.  Evidence of the hits he issued were presented at his trial as part of the evidence but they weren't a part of the charges since they had enough to put him away for life while keeping it simple.
