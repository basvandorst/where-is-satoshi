How does this shit add up into a say that makes a stable currency? I'm serious everything seems so complicated.

That countries currency is never going to resolve it's issues. Either they're going to be remade as another territory/country, overthrown by another militia or government. Or merge with another governing body or territory; which then their debts will be taken on by them &amp; another currency will be made to strengthen the value of the countries overall assets. There's no way in hell that the current government will ever be solvent again. Ever.

I don't know, Bitcoins complicated for the layman, average person. Someone who has trouble pairing Bluetooth devices or setting up their router isnt going to understand a P2P, operating with the Blockchain as it's ledger; financial system/market with very limited regulation that operates completely in cyberspace.

That's cool thanks for supporting. I'm not sure what you have to do to make sure it's registered on ATM maps but do that so people know.

Yea, sounds about right. But I do agree it's probably a little of both. Ignorance &amp; sensationalism.

He is. He also is a state-of-the-art statistician who dislikes institutions that bear little risk &amp; gamble with public funds so this alternative to the centralization of the current financial systems perfect for him.
