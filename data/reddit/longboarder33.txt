Saifedean is an economist, but in this book he is also a scathing social critic, dismissive art historian, and very VERY opinionated on topics ancillary to his primary thesis.
This greatly weakens his argument, because it saps his overall credibility.  He comes across as just another internet crank at times in this book.
His ad hominem attacks on Vitalik B. and other young blockchain entrepreneurs also make him look petty.  Plus ad hominem attacks -- which he does constantly on twitter -- are worthless and speak volumes about the character of the attacker.  He is a weird mix of confident and under-confident at the same time.
Also, as an economist, to dismiss the productive labor of - let's say 1 million -- young engineers and entrepreneurs in the Ethereum ecosystem is arrogant as hell.  He's essentially calling every single one of these people a scammer.
That said, I liked the book and believe there is a non-zero chance that he will be right about bitcoin as a global reserve standard.

I see this from Caitlin Long and now from you, categorically stating that state regulators are out to "ban direct ownership" of crypto, and I look and look in the bill and I can't find confirmation.
I'm not saying it's not in there.  I'm just asking you to please quote this language directly -- as in, there is no other way to interpret this language other than "you have to indirectly own crypto through an intermediary".
Thanks.  I think many non-lawyers would find this helpful.
