I was waiting for these alts to die. I saw a YouTube video from a car YouTuber telling people Tron is going to a dollar and how there shit coins went up %10,000 
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:25:06
I was one that said it was too late, that was back when it was $400. People were telling me it was too late, and I was like, how much higher can it go.

Bitcoin has given me heart attacks and enlarged testicles. I panic and then I buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:16:22
That's why he or she should have bought a Lambo.

Pay taxes? What do you mean? I'm located in the Cayman Islands.

I doubt it. Someone as dumb enough to do that wouldn't have enough credit to be given out a loan like that. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:09:04
The prices are falling and falling fast. I suggest you guys to buy this coin called Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:59:18
Yes.

McLaren Philadelphia made an Instagram post on how they sold a car through bitcoin at 18k per BTC. Someone picked the perfect time to buy a McLaren with one.

a 2 door Rolls Royce. I'd suggest you buy a Lambo instead of a Wraith. Rolls Royce depreciate harder than Bitcoin over the past week and a half.

I doubt it, just because it's Christmas. Not enough volume. Everyone will probably be with their families.

I'll take the possibility of quadrupling. That's a vacation.

I can see the headlines on TMZ now. Race car driver, Alex Bowman throws a punch at Justin Bieber in Ibiza, reportedly over Selena Gomez. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:50:32
Alex, before you leave.  Come say high to us at @_date: 2014-08-05 22:40:20
I should've watched the video.

So, what was your thoughts on the whole Josh Wise (saga? 
If this happens, I hope you guys don't become enemies. Frenemies is okay though.

I remember. The first of the two Bristol night race this year!
@_date: 2014-08-05 22:31:10
I followed you after that rain delay interview that one race. I forgot which race it was, since I feel the half of the first 10 races were delayed. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:11:03
I’m going to end up broke from buying
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:10:39
