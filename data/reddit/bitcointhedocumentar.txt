Im their newest customer. Because i have personal affiliations with Argentina and know a couple of ppl at the local btc scene i know how pressing this issue was. Now i can trade my btcs comfortably from home every time i go there! Although meeting up in person via cryptocueva or localbitcoins also has its merits!

If you have any questions for him, let us know!  
He is the initiator of the official inquiry of the Swiss parliament into Bitcoin:

We met this guy during our trip to London for an interview. He is a long time bank advisor and counselor to the UK government. Im looking forward to see more of him (for example in our Docu;)  
@ OP:  Is this snippet part of a larger project?

Looks great! Would you be interested to contribute some of your work to our Documentary project? Do you also do animated work?  
  
You can PM me here or write to admin  
  
Cheers,

Bad news for kickstarter, good news for it's Bitcoin competitors!  
  
I wouldnt have expected something like that when I chose not to use kickstarter for own documentary project, the decision was more based on the features kickstarter provides to present the project vs. our own site (bitcointhedocumentary.org) and based on the cut thats it takes (10-20 % in our case). Im glad that we always funded our project only with Bitcoins and can strongly advise anyone that has the chance to do the same!  
  
@ Wong: If you read this, get in touch with me, Im happy to share my experiences with you!

Maybe ONE Swiss that plans to make Bitcoin its own currency.

If they are self selected, by lets say a poll on anyone website they visit regularly this result is as good as useless. For this to hold any predictive power an established market research agency would have to randomly select a representative fraction of the whole Dutch population and approach them actively by phone or mail.

Thats why there is the scientific criteria of "objectivity" that is tried to achieve by different means that strive to take the observer out of the equation. The higher the objectivity the more reliable the results. Peer review usually uncovers systematic errors like that if they occur.
