Funny you should mention that.  No nonprofit ever spent a dime on legal fees for accepting e-gold donations.

I'm not surprised.  They overreached and the community raised an eyebrow.
If they had called this the "Bitcoin-QT Client Development Foundation" I would have bought a lifetime membership in a heartbeat.
If they really do intend for this to be modeled after the Linux Foundation -- as Gavin keeps repeating -- then they need to respect the distinction between the bitcoin client and the bitcoin network.

not seeing a pattern here
@_date: 2013-02-19 12:20:14
Yep.  It's called "proof of work", not "proof of connectivity".
A currency based on "proof of connectivity" is just fiat money all over again.

why the fuck were you using the *romanian* postal service eom

One thing I'd like to see is the option to hook the jalapeno directly to my magical unicorns.
@_date: 2013-01-29 23:09:11
Actually it was kinda nuts that they couldn't do that before, since the stores *get charged extra* just because you used a credit card.
@_date: 2013-01-29 13:51:27
the rest of us are laughing all the way to the bank...

Since you've clearly never heard of [inter-chain transactions]( I think you should do some more reading beofre commenting on this issue.
@_date: 2013-01-22 08:34:31
Same here.  Shipping takes a while and their bitcoin processing is pretty human-driven/non-automated right now, but theswisspharmacy.com is definitely legit.  Two orders completed and a third on its way.
@_date: 2013-01-31 04:31:50
get a grip, kid
@_date: 2013-01-26 12:26:19
Oh wait, I'm sorry, this doesn't mean you get your money back.  This just lets you file a "VAP CIP" which is merely a *prerequisite* to making a "VAP claim".

In case you had any quesions about whether or not OP is a tool, they are.

Buying a Jalapeno is *supporting BFL,* not supporting "the network".

You can also use Amazon Locker to get the mag anonymously.
@_date: 2013-01-23 17:27:37


You can register it to a corporation, and it doesn't even have to be an American corporation.  It's quite easy to hold land anonymously (at least if it's in the USA and you can afford good lawyers).

And so is namecoin; you should read up on it.  Each namecoin entry is a special coin in the blockchain, just like "colored coins".

Hope you enjoy getting the fuck scammed out of you, chargeback style.

I think there's some disconnect here.
The magazines that arrived showed up very quickly after they were mailed.  **The problem is that the publisher keeps forgetting to send them, or only remembers months later**.
For example, I once got two issues -- published a month apart -- which arrived together in the same white envelope.  Wtf?  Whatever caused that screwup isn't going to get fixed by changing couriers!
The problem here is not the courier.
@_date: 2013-01-29 05:22:53
Apparently only if your name is "Sonny".

SR level of security/anonymity is only necessary for stuff that is illegal in "most countries".  A lot of these pharmacies sell legitimate non-recreational medicines that are legal or non-prescription in a lot of places but not the US/UK/whatever.

Thanks for editing, but you're still incorrect: all the validation machinery is implemented in the chain validation scripts running on every miner.


You've still got it wrong: if the counterparty aborts you simply wait for the lock time to expire and you get your coins back.  You shouldn't agree to (i.e. sign) the transaction if the lock time is larger than the amount of time you're willing to have your coins frozen for (in practice an hour or so).
@_date: 2013-02-19 12:11:03
Gee, self-promote much?
@_date: 2013-01-26 20:06:24
Really good point.
Bitcoin itself doesn't have this vulnerability, but the exchanges still do.  I hope people keep that in mind.
@_date: 2013-02-08 03:12:58
It's the same technology as [namecoin]( but a bunch of people were upset they didn't think of it first, so they decided to make their own namecoin fork and call it "colored coins".
@_date: 2013-01-22 08:44:43


Carry modafinil.
@_date: 2013-01-20 03:09:20


Actually it's just a knock-off of [namecoin]( but about two years late.

Keep in mind that Gavin is an employee of TBTF, so he benefits from centralization.  And Mike Hern works for Google, not exactly a "small business".

Gee, suck up much?

I have been massively disappointed with my subscription.  Four of the last six issues have reached me **at least two months late** and one hasn't arrived at all.
At least with amazon they'll suffer (via their ratings) for this ineptitude.
@_date: 2013-01-29 23:00:11


in that case ur fuckd
@_date: 2013-02-08 10:44:35


You imagine wrong because of [merged mining](  The NMC hashrate is well above 6 TH/s and climbing; nobody's going to be mounting any 51% attacks against it anytime soon.

Wait let me get this straight: the people who run this site can't be bothered to read email because there's too much spam.  But they see no problem in insisting that their customers read the emails *they* send (this is the only way to get your wireless code).
**Hypocrisy fail.**
@_date: 2013-01-28 07:27:03
You're assuming that their shipper was the source of the incompetence.
@_date: 2013-01-23 11:11:56
Hrm, maybe some enterprising bitcoiner could buy a tract of wetlands somewhere and run an AML-free USD&lt;-&gt;land&lt;-&gt;BTC exchange.
I can see it now: **SwmpGox**.
