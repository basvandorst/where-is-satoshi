You must be talking about [this]( where Satoshi says that once the network grows beyond a certain point, only nodes with server farms running specialized hardware trying to create new coins will need to run a full node, the everyday user can just use SPV.
He goes on to calculate that processing 100 million tx per day would take about 100GB of bandwidth, which he didn’t view as a problem.
Or are you talking about [here]( where Satoshi says there should always be room for at least some free transactions?

Nah that interviewer was trolling. Ver made all the right points from a technical stance. Bitcoin will continue to succeed, but anyone who understands the fundamentals knows that Bitcoin Cash handles scaling appropriately as per Satoshi's vision.

Im with you brotha, the PoW system being energy intensive is a feature of bitcoin, not a flaw.

"I'm on this subreddit all the time" - don't you know who moderates Why would Bitcoin Core shit on their own software. I highly recommend you do a deep dive on Blockstream (outside of @_date: 2017-11-27 19:28:05
At 64MB I can still run a full node. At that point in the future I'm expecting ISP's to be offering higher bandwidth services. SSD space will never be a problem.

@_date: 2017-11-15 17:25:47
So Blockstream/Core being owned by AXA Insurance (one of the biggest companies in the world) seems legit to you? 
My scenario is not only realistic, it's already happened. 
PLEASE get informed people. Is Bitcoin Cash perfect? No. But it's a community attempt to save Bitcoin from Big Banks discreet takeover.

Then you should know 2x was a trojan horse attempt to highjack &amp; centralize Bitcoin by TPTB. [This Post]( will connect some of the dots. If you were informed you would never have supported 2X
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:33:00
I understand the concept behind open source development, and that there are members of Core who act independently according to what they believe is best. But when you have a company ran by the elite throwing tens of millions of dollars at certain developers in the Core team, you can bet certain agenda's are being pushed.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:46:05
This is my whole point. Bitcoin was compromised and Bitcoin Cash forked off to preserve the original ideals behind Bitcoin.

SegWit has well documented security holes if you don't mind doing some due diligence. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:11:35
You mean Satoshi's original peer-to-peer digital cash? With low fees and block size increases as needed to match transaction volume without the security compromising SegWit? I agree. Go BCH!!
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:41:00
TPTB (The World Elite) do not want Bitcoin to succeed in the conventional sense, as it is a system beyond their control. 
When you can't beat them, infiltrate them. Any agenda pushed by them is designed to benefit them, usually at the expense of the masses. I love Bitcoin with all my heart, and it has the ability to transform the world, but I would rather see Bitcoin die than turn into another system of control at the hands of the corporate elite. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:27:56
Exactly, and that's the problem. Everyone is saying "Lets Get Rich", when they should be saying "Let's Save The World from Corporate Corruption and Greed", which Bitcoin finally allowed us to do for the first time. People need to start caring about the technology more than the dollar signs. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:47:14
lolz k dude. I can't argue with a guy who doesnt understand the tech and is mostly just interested in the dollar signs and getting "free coins"

My node can handle about 300 tx per second. &amp; I'm a peasant. So why are we capping out @ 7?
Storage space is getting bigger and cheaper every year. Bandwidth is getting wider every year. 
2nd layer scaling will be required - but it isn't yet. &amp; a 1mb block cap is too low, there's NO reason to have it so low. It was set as a temporary limit and was meant to scale as adoption incurred. 
Lightning network is a terrible solution. From the very first time it was explained to me it sounded terrible. I'm gonna deposit $100 into a time based channel with starbucks for the coffee I anticipate buying in the future? No thanks. I don't want to loan mass sums of money to corps to get refunded whatever I don't use after a certain time period and then repeat the whole process endlessly with every entity I do business with.
Gavin Anderson's [Graphene Scaling Solution]( is far superior to LN. Or maybe you'll prove me wrong when lightning network is implemented "in 18 months".

AKA I can't attack BCH tech or scaling solutions, so I'll be shitting on their libertarian supporters and the dev team's personal lives.

I am opposed to all 2nd layer scaling. If you are in favor of 2nd layer scaling, then you are missing the point of the original blockchain. 
An increase in block size is the only logical approach to scaling at this point in time. 
SegWit raises technical debt significantly with dubious value - but fine.
Much of the community conceded on SegWit as long as we could also increase the block size as needed to meet current transaction volume.
Throttling the block size needlessly to push in LN &amp; off chain scaling is a tactic being implemented by Blockstream/AXA Insurance/Bankers. 
We will need secondary layers someday, but certainly not while our block size is only 1mb. 
Perhaps someday blockchains will communicate with each other so that one like ETH can manage smart contracts interacting with the world while BitCoin is like our bank accounts. 
The mempool overflowing is bad.  $20 fees are bad. 7tx second is bad. This need to be fixed.

by all means, buy from coinbase! 
but for as long as it sits in the coinbase wallet, they have custody of the private keys that your bitcoin are assigned to.
“Not your keys, not your bitcoin!”
after you buy it, you need to send it to any wallet which you hold the private key.
the best solution is to get a dedicated hardware wallet which stores your private keys offline. [trezor.io]( 
However, until you are more confident and have a better handle on all this, do yourself a favor and keep them on coinbase.
@_date: 2019-04-10 06:29:59
Whoever holds the private keys to that address owns that bitcoin. period. end of sentence.

Hosting a full node without actually mining is a waste of resources. It does not contribute to the security of the network or even your own bitcoins.
