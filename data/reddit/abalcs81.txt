Agreed OP.  Let it consolidate, avoid mass attention, build higher bases.  If history repeats the last bull market then retracing to the 100 day MA is in the cards at $8500.  Bounce from there and begin the next leg up.  Time will tell though...

Forbes is dog shit. The editor gives the slant to the writer and the writer forms a narrative from that directive. Nothing fresh. Nothing original. Nothing accurate. 
Grasping at straws for clicks. Very sad. 
Ask ppl in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Argentina, and many others with inflation problems today if they need it.
I lol'd at the poor store of value argument. Name another asset outperforming bitcoin this year despite the recent correction. I'll wait Forbes...

I'm not really sure how to interpret this...  I picture you're sitting in a dark basement with a tinfoil hat.  I'm just curious if anyone else had thoughts on this new on-ramp and what it's touting to be able to do.  Simple as that.

The current stock to flow estimated fair market value. 
Perhaps more like $8400 to be precise but close enough. 
@_date: 2019-10-08 21:16:08
If it's priced in then can you tell us why the stock to flow value is dead on the current price level and has a 95% accuracy historically?
@_date: 2019-08-25 19:52:30
Valid point about taxes but that also applies to gold so bitcoin then as a store of value is still more finite than gold, transferable across borders easily, permissionless, transparent, divisible, and can't be confiscated.  
Don't get me wrong I like both but it is viable as a payment system in parts of the world that need it most right now due to hyperinflation.  There are plenty of places in the world that don't share our tax structure where bitcoin is being used for trade. 
It's still very early days and taxes around bitcoin IMO will change with adoption of the network and as other countries create more favorable tax laws around it.  Bitcoin has many fights ahead of it but the network will never stop and I believe it will outlast every fight en route to becoming a global store of value and payment system it promises to be.

Dude patience. People rightfully want to go slow and build up to it to let them work out kinks of a new operation. Etf's would likely go the same way. 
Comparable to giving a new restaurant a month to figure out their kitchen, staff, service...etc before dining there.

Personally I think the SF price model offers the best data for fair market price of roughly $8500. If we're trading sideways here through the new year I'm fine.

@_date: 2019-08-15 03:20:36
Who knows.  Personally I hope it chops around between 8500 and 12k for a couple months, then begins a slow and steady climb in early Q4.  Maybe challenge the ATH by early next year.  
I believe we're a bit overbought currently with the SF model price being \~$8500 but the global economy has so many variables related to currency wars, inverted yield curves, shrinking liquidity, unclear Fed policy for further cuts or not...etc that could all impact Bitcoin.  Plus much more.
Personally I think Bitcoin in the long term is going to see incredible lift from the halving next May with most of the increase coming post-halving.  I wish I could go to bed and wake up the day before the halving.  
Up. Down.  Doesn't matter in the short term.  I'm just going to enjoy this ride.

i'd bet lower..like 30k.  previous bear market bottoms have been roughly half of this models' price value.
@_date: 2019-08-29 03:43:46
I thought about this but also think that adoption and awareness of how this market moves are much more established by comparison to that time period. Could be accelerating the growth faster than the last cycle. 
Only bitcoin knows for sure.
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:33:20
To me this feels like May /June of 2016.   We were also 50% of the ath like we are now and had reached ath by December. 20x gains from there. And that was 1 month before the halving. 
This market is much faster and If history repeats,or even rhymes that could put us at or near 200k by EOY 2021. Maybe even sooner.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:09:00
you would think a long time investor would know this...it's the right answer.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:45:49
I get that and I like the idea of btc maximalism (sp?) but it's still an "if" as you put it. If I can be 37/38 and guarantee financial independence for my family while still having a long allocation it would seem imprudent to not take that deal. 
To each their own. Who knows what could be awaiting btc by 2022 and beyond. 
Risk management. That's my thought.
@_date: 2019-10-02 21:56:01
I hope it's right because
A) my life is so much better when bitcoin is rising fast and hard (insert penis joke here) and 
B) because the next predicted stop is something like $32k I believe and dumb as this prediction is the mystery of wondering if maybe this person really knows wtf they're talking about is super intriguing. 
Also because all us reddit btc geeks will lose our shit.

@_date: 2019-06-23 23:30:18
I don't see why it can't be both. To invest back in 2015 I think should clearly mean I'm in for the tech, no?
Creating generational wealth by becoming totally and officially debt free IS more important than the idealism to me.  Guilty. But I'll still have my stacks in place for the possibility that it's hits $1m or beyond while setting up income streams in the fiat world. 
One system will not replace the other IMHO.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:27:03
Don’t misunderstand as I’m not saying that you’re wrong, but I’ve never seen anyone refute Andreas so many times in such a short period of time. Like ever. With as knowledgeable as you sound about this you should probably challenge him to a public debate over such matters. 
What’s your background?
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:52:03
I hear what you're saying but 5% profit at $50k is so small to lock-in a big chunk of increased monthly cashflow.  I'll still have truckloads more still invested compared to 99.9% of the general public.  I'll still have tickets to the moon party.

Ideally not but I don't know of any other easy and convenient on ramps that circumvent the AML/KYC regulations.  Would it be better to purchase through a custodial, xfer it to a Wasabi wallet, and link the Wasabi to the node?

@_date: 2019-12-13 01:19:34
Hell no!  I keep 95% + in cold storage and 5% or less in exchanges that I accumulate until i'm ready to move it to the hardware wallet.   For now I'm looking to fund a few lightning channels and get familiar with using the network.  This is all new to me so in response to your question, a question:
Should I connect my custodial wallet to it or no?  What are the pros/cons of doing that?  I'm primarily a hodler and very infrequently transact in bitcoin.  It's like giving away pieces of a winning lottery ticket.
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:14:59
Fwiw Bitcoin traded flat(ish) in the 7-8 months that preceded the last halving. I realize things are different this time but I hope this is one of the times he's actually right. 
If I want predictions I'm sticking with Bob loukas and planB until and unless proven wrong.

Tells us the network security continues to strengthen as more miners jump into the picture.  More miners, more difficulty, they'll keep increasing so long as it remains profitable. 
Many believe hash rate front runs price which I believe is true and a great sign for the near term. It's exactly what you'd suspect would happen in advance of the halving next may.

Basically they want to ensure its a market they have more control over, hence bakkt via ice, Fidelity, and other institutions offering custody first. Patience required. Just my opinion I don't think it'll be approved until next year at earliest though I don't think the bitcoin market will dip over a rejection either. 
Once ample reserves are on hand they'll approve etf's and bitcoin is going to skyrocket. Thing is, by that time it'll be retail driven and the big boys will have already loaded up. Middle/Late adopters. 
I reckon I'll be retired by then.

I had one that I liked for its esthetic appeal but it died about a year later. It just wouldn't turn on so I reached out to keep key and after several emails I provided video evidence of the fact it wouldn't turn on and keep key went dead silent from there. I emailed them no less than a dozen times practically begging for a reply that never came. 
I posted about it here in response to another persons question like yours and sure enough someone from keep key tried to help but the relationship damage was done from before. 
Bought a Trezor and never looked back. Very happy. 
Maybe keep key has improved service since but this was my experience.

I don't think this dump people expect will happen. At least not as severely as in past cycles. There is too much awareness, usage (check coin.dance daily transaction charts in South America, Thailand, US...etc), and institutional on ramping happening that are likely to condense how prolonged this consolidation period lasts. 
I think $4500 - 4700 is the most we'll see to the downside from here. Then slow climb to 8k - 10k by EOY. 
But who really knows ��‍♂️
