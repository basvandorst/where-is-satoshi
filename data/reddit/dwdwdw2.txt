The mask is associated with Anonymous, the same clowns that DDoS'd the CIA's web site.

This seems like a ridiculous distinction, trading currency in every way resembles the regular trade of stock, however instead of backing something concrete and tangible like the performance of a single company, you're backing the financials of an entire economy and its prevailing governors.
As with stocks, if there were no confidence in the financial performance of a currency, its value would collapse, ergo it couldn't be traded.

Bro, if you understand the environment behind Bitcoin, long term, it's going to be regulated driving rates up and volatile due to early adopters dumping their coins, driving rates down.
You can read Bitcoin's future however however you like, but please don't claim with absolute confidence it'll be around, and absolutely healthy, and absolutely at a higher exchange rate than it is now.

Anyone care to translate?

From my limited understanding, there is a huge overhead in providing reconfigurable logic that amongst other things places an upper limit on the clock rate of the FPGA (~50mhz for cheap models, &lt;300mhz for higher end models). There are fixed limits for the speeds at which electricity can travel, and the speed at which the logic can react to changing signals.
If an ASIC containing the same logic allowed for a 5x or 10x clock increase, then there is your win.

The average troll: Replies to lighthearted comment on situation presented, insults commenter for it, comes back later and claims how obviously real he is.

Is the image of a masked hoodlum wearing a Muslim headscarf, already heavily associated with cyberterrorism in the popular press, the kind of icon you'd want for improving Bitcoin's public image?

What sort of dumb fucking question is this? BTC has something on the order of 60k users globally (based on host count), when there are approximately 7bn on the planet; none of those 60k use BTC as primary currency (unless they're insane).
What do you think? No of course it's not the underdog, silly.

There is some romanticized view that the Internet is a vast frontier of anarchic links between organizations with diverse interests. This might have been true in the 70s, but the reality is that today's Internet follows a very straightforward tree topology, with most businesses connecting to ISPs, connecting in turn to a vastly smaller set of [Internet exchanges]( (for example in the UK, shutting down only LINX would suffice to take offline the majority of consumer broadband and local web sites), which in turn interconnect over lines provided by telcos that number between 1 and 10 per country.
Long before the Internet ever existed telecoms was recognized as critical infrastructure, and so there exists a very old link between those companies and government.
Finally and if all else failed, there are only a handful of submarine cables providing the bulk of international bandwidth to the USA.
In short if the government needed to shut down the Internet in an emergency, it could do so very easily through multiple means.

"on the order of" gives room for the number I gave to increase by 60ish %, in any case suggest a better estimate, I could find none.

Gosh, and there I was thinking it originated in the 2005 movie V for Vendetta

So you found a motel with a vending machine that accepts BTC? Awesome

Posting this with no context and no references just wasted 15 minutes of my life digging through bitcointalk.org trying to find out what happened. Turns out.. nothing.. just more drama, lack of evidence, hot air, and people trash talking things that haven't happened. Thanks.

Did you actually move all your funds into BTC? You realize Mt. Gox appears to have fuck all cash right now? (And they're the largest exchange)

How did you conclude this from the screenshot?

But fantastically fewer legitimate addresses in use already (actually, less than 2gb worth of them, going by my BitCoin data dir)

The problem is that the community is too small to withstand malicious rumor, which this very much is. From reading the comic it seems clear that BS&amp;T has *already* gone bust. Any resulting panic may well lead it to, and so it's pretty irresponsible to post this kind of thing.
