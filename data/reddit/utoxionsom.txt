The electric grid could grind to a hault.  This gets less and less likely year after year as more renewable energy generation comes online.
Full scale thermonuclear war could wipe out the vast majority of human life.
A global natural disaster of some sort.  A large Asteroid collision, or something similarly massive in scale.  Maybe a devastating viral plague.
Cryptographic obsolescence.  If someone invents a hardware and/or software solution that can crack anything in a short of amount of time, then spending on the public ledger becomes meaningless.  This one isn't a certainty since the protocol itself could perhaps be updated in order to safeguard security again before the threat can manifest.
51% attack that, if successful, would undermine the legitimacy of the ledger itself.
Out right government ban, especially on a global scale.  Imagine if crypto were treated the same as child porn by governments.  It would still exist.  It would still have some value, to be sure.  But it would also be marginalized.
Here is my favorite: successfully coupling an AI agent with the ability to generate its own financial gains, and giving it the priority of hoovering up Bitcoin faster and faster such that humans can't compete and have no coin left with which to trade. 
None of these are very likely.
The biggest deterrent to mainstream adoption atm is, in my mind, the fact that the currently rich and powerful got that way without needing bitcoin and are smart enough to realize that if they jump all in now, they'll just be making the "wrong" people rich.  And by "wrong" people, I mean early adopters who aren't already in the rich and famous club.  If that sounds ridiculous and like the antics of high schoolers, it's is because it is ridiculous and like the antics of high schoolers.  It sucks, but that is reality. 
It will take the baby boomers dying out or a massive shock to the dollar to force mainstream Bitcoin adoption in the near to mid term.
Because even if level 2 (lightening) or level 3 solutions are invented and take-off, many of the mainstream conveniences of Bitcoin can and already have been adopted by Central banking.  By this, I mean things like paying for goods by waving your phone at a terminal.  That could of and should of been a bitcoin reality first.  But that opportunity is largely already gone.   Now we are left with the fundamentals that require existing monetary systems to fall before the masses see the shine on Bitcoin.

No one here seems to understand what you're asking.  And really?  Make up whatever. Those small amounts don't get you audited.  The real point is that it's silly to tax these trades.  Bitcoin should be treated as money. It's not.
If I exchange dollars for euros and then buy something at a store in Paris a month later, no one expects me to calculate capital gains. It would be a dumb thing to do. And even the government's don't really want you doing that. Because then you get to claim losses on all that inflation there always causing on their own money supplies.

@_date: 2019-07-29 13:00:42
Which is bullshit.  If I covert dollars to euros and buy something with the euros, I don't have to factor in the inflation as "capital gains" between the two events.  (Or even just holding the dollars for a few years and buying somethibg with it) . 
None of this makes any sense.
Government needs to quit treating crypto as property and treat it, instead, as a currency.
I've paid my taxes.  And that included the fucked up situation where I had to figure up capital gains on using crypto to buy items valued in crypto (not dollars and not from America). That's fucked up.  It sucks that ignorant baby boomers are still making all the damn rules due only to their numbers rather than their competency.
That generation can't die out fast enough.

That's because there are many actors throwing many resources at mining an artificially finite resource.  Think about it long enough and you'll realize that it's a good thing. 


Are you implying that there is a currency where this hasn't happened? By the way, the fact that Bitcoin can be effectively stolen at all is due to its inherent security.  It's so secure that once stolen it can't just be taken back.  Think about for a bit. 


I can't tell if you're joking or not.  Considering you went from grand theft into this point, I think you are implying that because large amounts of Bitcoin have been stolen, that security is an issue.  If that's what you meant, then you probably haven't thought this through very well.  That perceived security you enjoy in a flat currency?  Is only possible by banks just creating more money out of nothing whenever they feel like it.  Throwing money at problems can seem like a fix, but it's more like a tax on everyone to fix someone's pain point.   Fiat money isn't secure because it can be returned when stolen / lost in large quantities.  It's simply replaced by even more money created on the spot.  If you can't see what the problem is with that, approach, then there is still quite a bit for you to ponder in this space.


Do you know what the 'incentive' is to use any fiat currency?  What initially gives them any value?  The answer to that question is the key difference between a traditional fiat currency and Bitcoin.  The monopoly on legal use of force that the state enjoys is employed to compel citizens to value that state's fiat.  How?  *By defining the currency that taxes must be paid in.  The state makes up taxes, and then makes up a currency that one must obtain to pay those taxes in.  That's it.  Your whole monetary 'normal' is predicated on that concept.

There is a single simple reason that Bitcoin hasn't been better adopted at the highest levels in America.  Doing so would make the wrong people rich.  All you hodlers out there who would become financial titans overnight?  Yeah. The powers that be are thinking "fuck that". 
I hate to admit it, but Bitcoin probably has to wait for boomers to die off before enjoying broad support in the USA.
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:31:27
It doesn't work that way.  It's more like:
"Well shit.  I have already missed the boat. The vast majority of Bitcoin has already been allocated.  There isn't any blue ocean here.  Fuck it.  Current system is fine as I've already conquered it." 
This particular game isn't getting played by their golfing buddies.  There is zero peer pressure and there wasn't enough understanding early on to get that ball rolling.  If they can't get in on the ground floor, they ain't getting in. 
Younger folks, however, still see Bitcoin as still being on the ground floor.  They aren't wrong, but they also aren't in charge of anything (institutions, lawmaking, etc).  So little can be done to move the needle. 
Current pricing has Bitcoin in the many thousands when compared against the dollar.  And currently it's basically just been used as a type of investment vehicle.  Tax law in America is currently looking at it incorrectly.  Once people start actually using it as a currency (and that may not even be broadly possible until it matures and adds some more features), things will drastically change and adoption will go through the roof.  At that point, having a single Bitcoin will make one wealthy (and it won't matter how many dollars it can be converted into). 
People think a down market will be the catalyst.  It could cause investment to flow in, but a bad market wouldn't cause adoption as a currency. 
Rather, what really needs to happen?  The silver bullet?  Get China and America to change their laws and demand that taxes be paid in Bitcoin vs. their fiat currencies like they are today.  ***That*** would move the needle and get adoption really rolling. 
So, Millennials.  Get your asses elected and change the law.  'Cause the Boomers ain't ever gonna do this and the Gen Xers probably don't have the numbers to ever truly be in charge at all. 
Oh.  And stop and think about why governments won't actually force folks to pay their taxes in Bitcoin and you'll eventually get right back around to my original statement.  Those governments don't control it.  And as result, the "wrong" folks would get the benefits.

Dumb question, are multiple addresses inside a wallet discernable from looking at the ledger?  If someone has their coin split across lots of internal addresses, do they look like they have less than they do?

Ok.  Fine.  Then I want to be able to claim a loss on all my money as inflation robs its value from me then.
If you don't think that's justified, then you don't understand what folks are saying with regard to bitcoin being a currency.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:06:48
Yeah.  I can't believe how many people just don't seem to understand that mining at a loss is just plain dumb.

I thought smartphones were dumb, but not sure to capabilities.  Rather, I saw the price of the first iPhone and thought "you'd have to be an idiot to pony up thousands for something like this fot 20ish months".
I still hold that view, btw.  I absolutely have a smartphone, but I came way late to the party when pricing had dropped and capabilities had drastically improved.  If I were forced to spend thousands again, I'd still just not have one.  I'm around a pc/laptop/phone all day at work and home anyway.  And my cars have GPS built in.  No way am I going over a certain cost per month for my phones.  I just don't value them that much.  Others clearly do, however.

So, the idea is that as price falls, the incentive to mine falls with it.  As that incentive to mine falls, miners get taken offline.
But so many dedicated miners have been fabricated at this point.  So so many.
So then, at some point. Someone could just turn a bunch of old miners back on (at a loss relative to power costs) just to produce a 51% attack and take control of the network.
Is that about the gist of the argument?
Here is where that fails in all cases except one.  In so doing, said bad actor will destroy all value in bitcoin.  If a 51% takeover happens, no one else will value the "stolen" bitcoin.  So it would not have profited the bad actor to go through the exercise. It'd be a bit like stealing money from a bank with an exploding dye lack inside.  You will have the Bitcoin, but the loss in confidence means that no one will value what you suddenly have. 
The exception to this is the bad actor who isn't trying to 'steal' Bitcoin, but rather invalidate the concept entirely.  Which this could accomplish.  So, think governments who want crypto ended in favor of their own fiat instead.
I'm honestly surprised there isn't a 51% failsafe somehow written into the protocol to invalidate any chains created by monopoly mining.  I don't know how that would be implemented, but if it could be, then this avenue of attack could be safely ignored.

Well, perhaps terms should be defined.   A miner can refer to a single computer performing the act of mining a block or an interest controlling one or more miners that all act to mine blocks in concert.  In other words, a computer, or a person; both being called a 'miner' .
If a person controls enough of the overall mining resources in the network, then they could theoretically control coin allocation by taking control and artificially dictating what the chain ultimately ends up recording.  This is the 51% attack.
If I understand the original post, the idea is that bitcoin's trading price (in fiat) must remain above the cost of mining (in fiat) for competition to flourish (thereby reducing the likelihood of a 51% attack).  Once this lower bound is breached, miners (the people) will take miners (the computers) offline.  However, the vast majority of bitcoin mining at this point is done with dedicated hardware that can't be re-purposed for other computing work.   So, yes.  Scores of miners (computers) will be shut off and left dormant as long as electricity in fiat exceeds mining profits (in fiat).  In a really bad scenario, the offline sources could be enormous and the difficulty drastically reduced.  At this point, even though it's at a loss, a miner (person) could elect to turn back on all their miners (computers) and try to engage in a 51% attack.  This would requiring timing and expertise to pull off.
Of course this entire discussion isn't talking about college kids with their nvidia cards at the dorm.  It's talking about the LARGE players who could potentially have the means to cause disruption at scale.  Companies like bitmain in China literally have warehouses \*full\* of miners (computers) that can be switched off and on as desired.  Also, their software could be updated in concert, as well, in order to try and manipulate the protocol.  
But like I said, if you're goal is to 'steal' bitcoin, it's counter productive in the 51% attack case as all confidence in the value of bitcoin itself would be eroded.  The thefts to date are singular events made against single actors (like an exchange).  So confidence in bitcoin as a concept has been preserved.  But the second an attack that can be applied to \*everyone\* manifests?  Well, it's all over for that coin.
So the only scenario left that makes sense is a bad actor that wants to erode confidence in bitcoin, not actually steal/control it.  This, paradoxically, would require them purchasing, controlling, and leveraging vast computing power with regard to mining; something that they probably haven't been interested in doing since they aren't interested in the viability of bitcoin in the first place.  So, it \*could\* happen.  It's really unlikely, but it \*could\* happen.
IMHO, the best attack against bitcoin has already taken place (and has been effective).  And that is the attack that tax law makes on bitcoin by treating it as an investment instead of as a currency.  \*That\* is where the biggest deterrent to mass adoption currently resides.  Petition governments to treat bitcoin legally as a currency and to also accept bitcoin as payment for taxes owed and it'll moon very quickly.

Sure it will.  Oh sure, there may be brief periods where folks will come together for a concerted effort to pay down some small portion of the debt for a brief period of time, but it will start growing again.  It has to.  The interest on the debt doesn't even exist yet until you borrow more money (grow the debt) to pay off the interest on past loans.
I honestly don't think 99.9% of folks understand this.  Moneyl literally doesn't exist without borrowing it into existence.
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:52:33
I love me some Bitcoin, so don't take this the wrong way, but fiat is an abstract concept.  When folks don't like the current iteration of the concept, they will reboot it and start it again. It doesn't necessarily ever have to "collapse" .  That mentality only applies if you think of money and debt as something tangible that actually matters.  It doesn't. It's a means to an end.
From a Bitcoin perspective, what really sucks is that the lenders have vigorously adopted ease of use across the intetnet and mobile.  That was a big potential use case for crypto (convenience) right there that slipped away during the last decade.
When you can just text people money and wave your phone at a terminal to purchase something, well, it can't really get more convenient than that.  Bitcoin should have gotten there first, imho

But what will, literally, a few dozen people do with property "rights" to everything when literally billions of others will riot and protect there own interests instead.  There is only so far it can practically go.
Without something like a perverse extreme of the free market (something like a tycoon that can hook everyone up to the perfect matrix and earn all the money because literally everyone wants that product), there are natural limitations on how much someone can actually own.  At some point. You can't really be said to own something if you'll literally never have time in life to even contemplate it.
