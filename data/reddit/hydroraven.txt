Glad to see bitcoins haven't turned some people into Wall Street robbers!

I just want to point out that he did order a hit against a former employee that was stealing from him, so if it's not for the drugs, then at least he should get life for that in my opinion.

Any enterprising businesses located outside of the market banning the BTC would see a surge in business.
For example, the US government decides to ban BTC. Your average American holding BTCs finds himself sitting on a personal reserve of the stuff, unable to go to the store to buy the book he had his eye on.
He googles his book and finds a merchant in France that sells the exact book he wanted and, even better yet, accepts BTCs. He buys it online, pays a little extra for shipping and a week later (if the French aren't on strike that week) receives his book.
It would be hard for the government to monitor these overseas payments and would be near impossible to know which goods have been paid "legitimately" and which haven't. It would translate to more work for the fine lads at USPS, but depending on how widely used the BTCs are in that particular market, it would ultimately lead to a dip in internal demand.
This is all just my opinion, YMMV

I'm genuinely interested.

To give you an example of what gox is trying to say, have a look at how the US government is trying to tackle "designer drugs".
The government first has to define what it is, and once that definition is set and that particular drug is banned by law, the people making these drugs change a molecule in their drug and it becomes "legal" again.
In order to ban something legally, you first need to agree on what it is. What gox is trying to say is that it would be very difficult to define Bitcoins legally. Bitcoins share features with other types of digital currencies, many of which are used by major corporations. In order to narrow the definition down to what constitutes a Bitcoin, the government would have to be so precise that, same as the synthetic drug dealers, a simple retooling of the nature of Bitcoins would render the law obsolete and useless.

Oh yeah, interested and looking forward to reading it.

Thanks for your generosity! It takes a certain degree of maturity to make things right.

Why not? If they believe we deserve a great deal, then it should benefit everyone.
