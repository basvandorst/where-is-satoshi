They're designed in a way where the key never leaves protected storage. At a high level, you effectively send a transaction into the device which is signed and they transmit a sign transaction out. At no point do the keys leave the secured enclave.  This differs from using something like a computer or a cell phone because on those devices all of the memory is able to be accessed if the running program has the right permission. Hardware wallets are designed in such a way where no level of authority will give you access to those keys
That said, there are always Sophisticated attacks. Make sure you read about those before you invest in a hardware wallet. But I do suggest it if you have any large amount.

OP, do you have the source for this?  I'd like to make an actual shirt.

Bad news...no config setting I can find.
Great news! Bitcoin is open source so you can change any part you'd like.
Here's a good starting point to edit that Debug Window
Since you're on windows, here's a place to start if you want to do your own build
Start a discussion over on their GitHub page's Issue Tracker.  There's a lot of activity there, and if you write high quality material, you can likely attract someone with the talent to make your vision part of the main client.

Ignore me.  I am no longer able to reproduce this bug so I'll assume it was a blip or my end some how. Looks nice.
As someone who had to stop using MetaMask because of the permissions asked (Read and Write on ALL pages) it's a no go for me for my production workstation.  Any plans on reducing the security footprint, perhaps by handling lightning:// or something?  I'm intrigued and will check out the source today.

Fundamental rule of crypto:
--If you are in poession of your keys, they are your bitcoin
--If you do not have possession of your keys, they are someone's else bitcoin.
Your keys, your bitcoin. Someone else's keys, someone else's bitcoin.

I didn't ask about mining or sending.  Technically, you can transfer ownership offline with private keys, with no network at all (eg: Casascius Coins 
Can you name a single currency that has ever gone to zero?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:10:23
What's a currency that's actually gone to zero?  Sure, worth nearly nothing, but even as simply keepsakes they have non-zero value.  Even the ancient greek drachma is still a 275th of a USD, and it's not accepted as legal tender anywhere.

I agree with you, and if I understand you correctly you mean that if the product was anticipated to provide 0.09 btc in value over that week it was a good investment.
I believe my disagreement with OP is both assumptions are not necessarily true (they may be, but I'm not trying to argue either). Assuming they're true leads to the paradox.   If i was to re-write these with only what we know and remove the assumptions:
Premise 1: Bitcoin has value, because people choose to have it rather than other goods and services. The amount of that value fluctuates and it is hard to predict.
Premise 2: Supply is limited, and will in the short term increase (mining), and in the long term trend asymptotically towards zero (lost coins). 
From this, there's not much you can gleam about the future value.  So there's really no paradox to consider.
TL;DR, anyone who says they know it's going to the moon or going to zero are claiming to have a crystal ball. We just don't know.

It's only bandwidth intensive to do the initial block chain sync (~150 gb). After that, it's as bandwidth intensive as you let it be.
While the community at large would prefer you to run a full node as that serves others, you can fairly easily setup a node that only downloads what it needs to serve your personal transactions. 
I haven't looked into it for years, but I'm sure there's solution like CoinPunk, where you can self host a hot web wallet.  But again, do so on your own hardware.  
I may return to this thread if I reserach this tomorrow. Likely won't, but I may, otherwise, I'll leave this dead project link here with hopes that it gets you started.
Check out Copay 
You can use that for desktop / mobile and either use the default (less secure) 3rd party backends, or you can host your own node and connect to that. This is super low bandwidth needed, and most of it is just setting up the network plumbing.

This is actually the case for most tech. You'd be an idiot to buy say...that iPhone, desktop, tv, or whatever electronics, because in a few years it'll be worth a fraction of what it was before.

Don't rely on a few changed words. If I was a seed phrase theif, the first thing I'd do is run your words through a script to test against common coins and many permutations of words changed because it is common practice to do just this.
Tl;Dr: changing your seed phrase makes it harder to remember and use, and not much harder to steal.
