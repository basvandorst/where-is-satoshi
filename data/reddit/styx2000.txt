i think your point is valid and should be considered by the crypto-community.
i remember a video by Andreas Antonopoulos where he makes an argument for a fully private and anonymous bitcoin. one of his arguments was, that the u.s. government abuses its power by forcing the whole world to abide by its laws, e.g. not doing any business with iran, north korea, etc. 
clearly this also has some bad effects on innocent inhabitants of these countries even if you think the base premise they are sponsors of terrorism or something similar is right.
he also said that there is no scientific evidence that any of these rules (like kyc) actually had an effect and that politicans (maybe meaning well) just write them into law because they seem to make sense without bothering to find evidence to support this claim (and also because the u.s. cements their global financial power by enforcing these rules).
i myself am in favor of privacy in this debate, but i think it's very important to make these decisions very deliberate, ideally based on scientific evidence. i must admit i haven't informed myself good enough. i would be very interested in solid research for both sides of the argument.

Didn't Bill Gates say he would buy 5 year put-options if he could?
There is a big difference in saying he believes in 5 years it will be worth nothing and in 6 months. 
And between buying put-options where you can only lose the invested money and going short with unlimited downside.
Im a a big bitcoin fan, but i feel the arguments here against Bill Gates (or Warren Buffett) are a little childish.

Its happening already. There was a case where a webshop gave higher prices to safari users than chrome users.

thanks, i like the clean minimalistic look!
I'd like some sort of chart built in. if its too much of a hassle or doesnt fit your ui maybe just a link to a chart.
I would prefer the update speed to be once a minute or so, i dont like the colors and positions changing 3 times a second. i assume the users of this app don't need real time data.
fyi, if it had charts (even rudimentary, nothing complex) i'd be willing to pay for the app.

you need 51% of the hashing power, not 51% of bitcoins.
and the biggest holder of any security can always influence the price. if warren buffett sells all his Coca Cola stock the price will fall.
If the 1% with the most USD decide to all sell USD for Yuan it will influence the price.

support just wrote me back, saying i can always see how much btc or fiat i get in the corresponding buy or sell screens. also third parties have to be paid.
i dont like that they can't tell me how much the fees are, but i guess you're right, 3% (presumably) isn't that bad when anonymity, cash and/or quick execution are important for you. (anonymity, because apparently you only need an email-adress to set up a bitpanda account if you don't need to deposit with sepa, paypal, etc).
curious to see, if this gives any exposure to bitcoin.

i just tried it. 
bought a voucher for 100 eur, no id necessary. dont know if there is a daily limit. 
logged into my bitpanda account (which i already had, but not verified yet). you have to enter the code you get and you can choose between bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum (not dash for some reason, even though it's advertised). i chose btc, afterwards i had 97,16 EUR worth of btc.
can't find anything about fees, asked support, lets see. 3% would be quite high...
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:34:29
fwiw, it's also ethereum, litecoin and dash.
apparently you get a coupon that you can redeem at bitpanda, so you still need an account with them. from what i understand the only advantage is, that you can use cash. you don't get a paper-wallet or something. if that's true it's still cool, but not that great (i do look forward to standing in line while the clerk explains bitcoin to some pensioner though)
