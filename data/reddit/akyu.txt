I think this is a crossroads for the future of bitcoin, which I've been thinking about since reading about Namecoin.
Do we want bitcoin to be a currency? Or do we want it to be some new public ledger/database for other services to build on top of? And can it be both without compromising one purpose over the other?

That is pretty much exactly the implementation that he is using. He isn't using that neural network library but the network structure is the same
Extrapolating out 20-40 data points like this guy is doing is just completely unreasonable with this type of network. You can extrapolate out about 1 data point and thats pretty much it. And even then there are other issues that come up

I actually talked with the creator of this site.
It's important to note that those error percentages are the neural network error rates, not the deviation from the actual price. Somewhat misleading. It actually means you can expect much higher deviations, as the neural network error rate isn't an indicator of the predicting power of the neural network. It only tells you how well the network conforms to your training set. Making the network conform to the training set is rather trivial and usually just a function of how long you let the network train.
There are a whole list of reasons why this type of feed forward network isn't good for this application but I don't want to bore everyone. It should suffice to say that if this kind of thing actually worked, every trader would be using it, as this type of network is rather trivial to implement.
As far as I can tell there is nothing on the site about the accuracy of this thing in terms of price. But I can also tell you his implementation if you are interested

How can you possibly calculate errors rates from future prices... prices which you don't have yet?

Well if you want anyone to take you seriously than you should explain your implementation. The implementation I linked is the one you explained on /sci/, unless that wasn't actually you. Maybe you took my recommendations from that thread and implemented them, in which case I would have some more interest in this thing.
I'm not trying to be a hater, but I'm just trying to tell people to be weary about these types of things. The name neural network catches a lot of attention and people might trade on this data without informing themselves properly.

Having the exact same issue, super frustrating
We need a new exchange... MtGox is constantly dropping the ball
