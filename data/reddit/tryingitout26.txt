You know it's a sad day when your drug dealer is more upfront with you than your bank.

You are some twisted souls. That's like saying "who wants to hear about the time my Uncle bought me a new bike...then molested me?"

Someone should post the suicide hotline number for Mark.

You could own two in a few hours if you wanted.

The shutdown is undoubtedly to reduce loss. They're probably checking transactions which were criminal. Based on all of the withdrawal problems they've had, they may have never even left gox...but decided they couldn't get them out so transferred within internal accounts. This would be a best case scenario. Mark leaving is to satisfy all of the people who wanted his head. I really don't believe they've gone under since the bitcoins still appear in people's accounts and haven't gone missing.

I don't know whether I'm in the past or present. Someone get me my hoverboard.

I'm having the same problem. Withdrew bitcoins on the 10th, still haven't hit the blockchain. No response from BTC-E. I wonder how many else are in the same situation.

Memory error. At least the theories are getting closer to reality.

For those who have been goxxed... 
(Yeah, I did it)

At least everyone had a head's up. I'm sure they will jump ship and destroy evidence.

I've had a lot of money missing from my btce account but I don't think that's their fault. It was awesome when I was a kid and would lose at poker, my grandpa would give me the money back. I don't suppose they have similar policies.
