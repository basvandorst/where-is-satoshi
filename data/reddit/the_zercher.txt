Maybe a dumb question, but theoretically couldn't you look up an address that had a large balance, put that in, and let it run? I mean, you'd never find it because of the sheer volume of addresses and the limitations of computing power, but is that possible? 
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:35:21
And those lines are just your interpretation of things. It may be wrong. It may be right. But posts like this really add nothing unless there's some depth- examine when this has happened before and what happened afterwards, those kinds of things. Not just a couple lines on a cherry picked chart.

So, do you tell the block where to be credited?

Well I already have a google doc to do this for me, but this is nice. I also have a "sell goal" where I know the price/btc when I would sell so that I could buy what I wanted with half the btc I've profited (ideally to buy the things in btc).
@_date: 2013-06-02 21:37:39
So then how does the miner gain access to those coins? 
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:19:48
lol, you can analyze bitcoin's future?
Let me guess, you see the big wall at 150$ and you realize it means there's a lot of asks at 150 but not any bids yet, so until there are some bids, 150 will be hard to break, but from there, it's to the moon?
Come on. Walls are useful in a short term context, but they can disappear in minutes. All analyses of the future suffer from the same problem: no one can predict the future.

As handy as gold is, it's still ultimately just a shiny metal with limited practical application.
But money is all just a medium of exchange- handy placeholders for goods. Money can also be used to make money (loans, interest, trading, etc). 
In the end, you can't eat gold, dollars, or bitcoins, but they're all pretty useful.

Smart man. I took a chunk out of my Roth Ira (principal, not interest) and got some precious metals before their big run up. Now wishing I had known about btc then.

Yeah, however none of that predicts the future with any more certainty than a coin flip.

Get a program (e.g. 50Miner) and join a pool (unless you have 3 7970s in SLI on a machine where you don't pay for power and can solo mine), then let the program mine. Enjoy.

Well, considering he's giving away far less than 1% of his net worth, I'd say he's not super generous. It's a nice gesture, don't get me wrong, but an equivalent would be me giving away a few pennies. Actually a lot less than a few pennies. I wish .00004% of my wealth was a penny.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:40:48

Note : this is more a "would you buy something like this with btc" than a price point question.

I finally found a semi-decent way to buy btc using a cc, so I ponied up and did that this weekend. I'm looking forward to the ride. I also allow my pc to mine in the background (I don't pay for electricity, so no biggie), and I earned a little bit of btc already.
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:02:16
Cool. Now if BFL would give estimated shipping for all of its paying customers, that'd be great.

They would have to match everything that came after 1PETER, and by case, which would take approximately forever.

Doesn't the blockchain have to confirm the transaction? Can it do that when it's to an offline wallet?

I bought from coinbase at cheaper than that and it was not cancelled. So I doubt that.

It depends on your system. If you're part of a pool, you get a "share" of the pool based on your computing power. 
So, [here's]( the mining comparison, based on graphics cards. [Here's]( a way to calculate your break even. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:56:17
Not yet, no. Hm. If it fails I'll go through coinbase I guess.
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:22:16
How can you get an untraceable wallet? No matter what address you end them to, couldn't the cops just watch it on blockchain.info? Then literally follow every bitcoins movement until it reached a wallet with a name attached to it? Unless you managed to sell it in person (has anyone ever bought &gt;100K$ in btc in person?) to someone who was willing to do that.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:27:56
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:33:34
So are they shifting the size of the miners? I seemed to remember reading that they would ship to pre-orders the same hashing power, but for example the jalapeno would be contained in a larger box.
