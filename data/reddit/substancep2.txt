1)Don't trust Coinbase to store large amount of  your BTC.
Make a wallet with cold backup.
2)Open a QuadrigaCX account based out of Vancouver, BC.
When it comes time to sell use them.

Cold storage = off the internet.  So hardware wallet like Trezor

Limit sell order volumes or stop trading if prices fall over 10 percent in a day are.some ideas that come to mind.  Also the CME must do a good job getting current prices from a variety of brokers because whales can easily crash a single broker at any time.

If you had a corporation that sold/bought bitcoins through a corporate account you could potentially defer taxes but will require quite a bit of setup.

Stop the FUD

10 percent has been mundane throughout bitcoins early history but once the big boys come to the table that kind of volatility is not acceptable.

Just to let you guys know.  I do believe in Bitcoin and will buy back again once things settle down.  I will use the same amount of fiat I sold with to purchase more BTC.  There is nothing wrong with being a smart trader.  PS I'm a pretty experienced currency trader and the pattern was undeniable.
Thanks and have a good day.

I'll take your bet (I love beer)

I am indeed a small bitcoin fish in this ocean but to me bitcoin is more than just its monetary value. It is an ideology that maybe we can live in a world where governments aren't printing endless money and society can trade with something that is finite and has real future value!  There are many like me. Together we are a formidable force.

There is no way out of capital gains, and you only pay capital gains on 50 percent of your increase so roughly 20-25 percent of the total gain will be taken.

Best of luck.

My decision alone has little effect BUT COLLECTIVELY we can make a difference.

Its not true, the minute you cash out your investment the tax is due as far as I know.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:10:21
This is false. You don't need to buy up some of bitcoin before entering a short position you just need cash. Basicaly whales could start a short position on CME then start dumping bitcoin on exchanges. They would profit in cash on the CME then use the cash to buy more btc at a lower price.

The resistance is futile
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:06:56
Absolutely ripped through 10600, resistance at 100's is not forming fast enough to stop the rise.

I use Etoro, which is not available in the US but has a lot of Canadian, European, and international investors.  You are right though, the exchange needs to be solid enough not to fail if things collapse.
