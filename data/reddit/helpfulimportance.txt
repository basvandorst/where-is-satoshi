Rodinhood simply let's you stake your fiat in their crypto holdings. There are no fees, but beyond even Coinbase, where you're storing you coins (not your keys not your coins) Robinhood doesn't even let you exchange or spend your crypto.  It treats crypto like a typical stock asset class where the fiat you have staked is based around the value of the underlying asset but you have no control of that asset.  
It fundamentally undermines the vision behind crypto and turns it into any other basic stock.
I don't have a great answer for you but I have Dollar Cost Averaging on Coinbase standard for almost 2 years now and, while yes, I pay fees and am buying at more than the actual strike price, have been doing fine.  And I can move my coins around and do with them what I will from Pro, as you  mentioned the transfer from standard to Pro is near instantaneous.

What was the online retailer? Show some love for those out there building the network!

It's not about the cost, they were advertising themselves on this sub as something like a harry's razor (i.e. quality product without the name brand markup), and as I'm always down to support retailers who accept crypto and have something I need, I was hopeful and wanted to show some love.
It's too bad the thing was absolute garbage not even close to a quartz watch you'd buy at a traditional retailer and their return policy is absurd.
My first red flag should have been when they advertised free shipping, then charged me $3 for shipping, live and learn but I was hopeful... at least it wasn't an expensive mistake.
Also, credit card debt??? Shit son, Experian doesn't even know my name, credit is for weebs.  I've been living on cash/crypto (within my means) my entire adult life.

Well yes, just trying to protect others on this sub and others who have likely seen their shilling and excited to use crypto in a real world scenario and letting them know that their watches are garbage and to be avoided. 
Cheap lesson but still wanted to share as they've been all over the crypto subs schilling their garbage.

Your keys your coins.  RobinHood doesn't actually give you your keys, so they aren't your coins.
If you want to actually use your Bitcoins to buy and sell goods and take place in the coming global marketplace you won't be able to do this with RobinHood.  If you're just looking for some quick hits on a market then RobinHood is your place.  
Just remember you'll be paying capital gains taxes out the ass if you do this and take a lot of gains within the year.

You don't take the gains :-)

I have two different rules I go by:
1) Accumulate, Accumulate, Accumulate
and 
2) Spend and replace... hodl what you but also take place in the market place, pure hodl plays are fine but spend and replace what you have where you can, drive adoption, build the future.

It's infinite. Fractional reserves and banking standards ensure that fiat currency will forever be printed an available.  This also makes it hard to track down a precise number since every time a deposit is made into a traditional financial institution that amount gets "created" at 90%.  Interest rates and this fractional nature ensure there is an endless supply of fiat and it's the Fed's job to make sure this stays in check. 
So really, there's no way to tell...

Accumulate.  Buy when blood is in the streets.  Be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy.

Well you are in theory buying bitcoin on RobinHood you're really just buying a stake in it, as you can't move it, spend it etc.  You're really just purchasing it like a stock without the premiums of like a GTBC.  You still own the asset at the level you purchased it from but if you want to use as anything more than a store of wealth you'll have to sell to fiat and transfer the money back over.
That said, if you're just in this for the investment gains, and selling back to fiat is your game, RobinHood is ideal because there are no trade fees or transaction costs.

Sure, through any fiat on ramp like Gemini or Coinbase, or if you want to go internet deep through other channels.  1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis, buy as much or as little as you like.

Always happy to help get new hands into the market :-)
When I say spend and replace, I mean, when I buy something off NewEgg or Overstock with Bitcoin I always replace my Bitcoin with fiat so I don't weaken my position.  
Hodling is fine, but it doesn't actually grow adoption. So spend it where you can and replace it.  This kind of mentality will help lead to a world where we don't have to spend and replace, everything just happens in BTC.

Can concur, have been in GBTC in my IRA (as well was hodling lots of other liquid crypto assets and the premium stays true) for several years now.  In fact, when I was day trading it, I made some great gains selling/buying when the premium rose or dipped.  At the end of the day it's a half dozen in one hand six in the other, but it's done fine by me.
