I should buy some of that money with some of that other money which isn't on sale.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:24:29
Exactly. I even took the bitcoin code, forged my own genesis block and started mining. Bitcoin doesn't belong to anyone and it can't be limited.
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:31:42
If you were to listen to the optomists and spectators on here, they'd have you bro eve that they could sell the lemonade at a loss and still make a profit if they get paid in Bitcoin. 
Something doesn't add up there.

Except the name NFL belongs to a legal entity. To which legal entity does the name BitCoin belong?

If crypto holds value, and fiat is a tool with which to spend, where does the value that crypto holds come from?

Here in Australia banks have introduced payid, which allows instantaneous payments without any fees. This isn't a fundamental issue with the technology, this is because banks have been doing this for 50 years. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 08:26:18
This isn't about bitcoin versus cash, this is about a crappy bank. I can still walk into my bank and withdraw money with a signature. I can even withdraw money from an ATM using just my mobile phone. 
And if Bitcoin is so amazing, why are you having to convert it to cash in the first place?
@_date: 2019-03-12 06:32:48
I mean, it's not like people accidentally threw out hard drives with "precious" Bitcoin on them omg the early days because they were worthless or anything.

My model says $61k by then. It's a hyperparametric ellipsis model.

Pfft. I have enough trouble finding and opening a ten year old Word document. Let alone a ten year old crypto currency that may or may not be supported by Windows 18, which is 128-bit only.

The only thing bitcoin makes we want to invest in is energy companies.
@_date: 2019-06-12 07:07:37
I thought the price of bitcoin couldn't be manipulated through artificial restriction on supply, unlike those pesty fiat currencies?
Or is it just that the artificial restriction on supply is better understood by more people?
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:14:57
Nothing at the moment. But think two decades down the track. How many specific technological implementations hold up over two decades?

Why would I want to INVEST in your CAPITALIST business when I can just invest in BITCOIN (the best future, we have the best futures here, believe me) and get even more LAMBOS without PRODUCING aNYThING
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:18:34
I'm selling all my stocks to invest in bitcoin. Because when all the companies are worthless, then bitcoin can really show its value to the world by continuing to appreciate whilst producing nothing. That's the true miracle of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:37:54
You make profits from something that's not an investment?
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:02:19
Trade profitably? You mean, using capital to generate profit? Sounds like an investment to me. Oh yeah, I see you're self taught.
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:49:20
You are, by far, about the most delightfully insane person I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. 
You keep doing you, bro :)

What's the P/E ratio of BitCoin, and how does that compare to the S&amp;P500?

It keeps me warm when the cats leave me.

Incidentally, what are you investing in if not stocks and shares?
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:01:16
Sounds like a sad, lonely, paranoid life to me
@_date: 2019-06-20 09:28:56
Hey genius, where did I say that *I* believe Bitcoin is an investment like a stock? What I said (for those that can do reading comprehension beyond a third-grade level) is that *other* people treat BitCoin as an investment that they expect returns on.
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:42:30
You can make new altcoins pretty fast, too.
@_date: 2019-06-20 08:51:23
Thanks! I iz pretty clever. 
You don't think people investing. In bitcoin want a return on investment?
@_date: 2019-06-12 07:09:27
Serious question: if people are investing in crypto  early because they hope it will reach stratospheric highs, why would other people who didn't invest early want to get involved if there are other alternatives?
@_date: 2019-06-12 10:17:35
Those that didn't get in on one company had the opportunity to get in with other companies though. Also, companies are not the same thing as currencies.
@_date: 2019-06-21 06:17:42
I like me. See, the thing is, I know I'm a moron. Everything in life is easier with a simplistic view. Nonetheless, I like it when people tell me why I am being a moron specifically, because then I can try really hard to be slightly less moronoic.
@_date: 2019-06-12 10:51:51
There are lots of other crypto currencies with the properties of bitcoin though. I can fork bitcoin right now with my own genesis block.
@_date: 2019-06-20 09:00:01
I have no idea what you're on about. Your intellectual superiority has been noted however. So intellectual your message is lost. Smart people are usually the best communicators.
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:49:29
For now. Let's see in a decade. Or two decades. Or a century. Because that's how long these hints need to last for, and I can't even go a week with my operating system breaking or a security vulnerability being found in some seemingly innocuous file format.

@_date: 2019-06-20 14:43:29
I'd have to work to get paid, wouldn't I? I think that's how it works. 
I don't own any bitcoin, because it's not terribly useful currently as a currency, and it's certainly not what I would call an investment.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:25:36
And people who buy bitcoin aren't investing in it and don't want a return in investment?
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:01:37
But you haven't actually said what you think is stupid?
@_date: 2019-12-21 05:51:36
Relative to what?

You’re more than welcome to spread that message through a decentralised platform.

@_date: 2019-12-13 13:24:40
How does Bitcoin allow money to be transferred with no third parties? Aren’t all those miners verifying transactions and the integrity of the blockchain “third parties”?
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:02:15
Isn't "decentralised government" an oxymoron on multiple levels? 
If it's decentralised, how can it be government?

How does Bitcoin help avoid inflation? Is it because Bitcoin inflates in value too?

All the best developments in mankind's history required endless spruiking by the enlightened.

Yet. 
Laws remain more powerful than cryptography.

Australia now also has PayID, which allows for instant transfers between banks at any time. This isn't a problem that requires bitcoin as a solution - it's a problem that requires improved intrabank infrastructure.

Don’t hold your breath. There’s a new Bitcoin-derivative coming that has a maximum coin count of 1 billion, rather than the paltry 21m that Bitcoin offers. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 11:00:08
This is just proof that nothing good can come of currencies based on the antiquated notions of maths and numbers.

The best thing about cryptocurrency is how quickly it’s accelerated everyone to expert economist status.

Wow! Must be some money to be made in helping people get away from the capitalist banks and into the safe harbor of crypto!

Because it is very seldom the case that the first iterations of new innovations become ubiquitous. 
The first fiat currency, jiaozi, has its origins in 11th century China - yet that wasn’t a standard that was universally adopted. 
What makes you think BitCoin could never be replaced by an alternative at any point in the future? If BitCoin is replaced, the finite number of them becomes completely moot. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 14:05:46
A consensus? And what happens if and when that consensus changes? What is magical about BitCoin that makes it the one and only irreplaceable coin?
@_date: 2019-01-06 10:54:06
The term “false equivalency” comes to mind here. 
“Would you prefer a currency that tastes like ice cream, or one that tastes like old socks?”

The supply of cryptocurrencies overall I sn’t fixed at all. 
Gold is the only physical element that has that set of unique properties. 
Bitcoin, on the other hand, could be forked tomorrow with a new root block. The new coin would have the same properties as Bitcoin. 
It’s more correct to say that the number of Bitcoins *with a given root block* is limited. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 11:31:55
Well, first they’ll have to find one of those legacy USB adaptors that were discontinued years ago in order to read the thing off the (no longer supported) hardware wallet, assuming you can get drivers for it. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 12:56:01
So what exactly is Bitcoin? Is it the code and the protocols Or is it the root block? Or a combination thereof?
As for the unique properties of gold: it’s the only element with an atomic number of 79. It is incredibly malleable, ductile and a good conductor of electricity. It’s also highly biocompatible. It’s also the only element with a melting point of 1064 degrees Celsius.

“This thing is worth lots of this other thing, which has just become worthless.”
Yeah, makes sense.

Neither of the situations depicted are a good thing.
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:54:35

How many jobs does every dollar invested in the stock market generate, vs the number of jobs for every dollar invested in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-25 00:56:14
That’s what I’m hoping :) 
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:27:07
Oh I see. So if I buy a Bitcoin, it won’t necessarily be worth as much as the electricity that went into producing it? Isn’t that kind of like making pennies out of gold?
@_date: 2018-12-22 00:09:24
Why is the portfolio balance displayed in dollars? When I log into my bank it doesn’t show my account balances in a foreign currency, it shows the balance in the currency of the account. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:08:02
Yes, but shouldn’t the value be displayed in Bitcoin? Isn’t that the currency of the account?
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:06:58
Why not necessarily?
Shouldn’t the Bitcoin be worth more than what went into producing it?
@_date: 2019-05-01 09:19:48
But neither 90 or 180 are prime numbers. I think your analysis will be more insterestig if you use prime numbered window sizes.
@_date: 2018-12-23 17:21:01
So you can use this to withdraw bitcoin?
