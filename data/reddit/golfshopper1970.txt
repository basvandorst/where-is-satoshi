It’s not Coinbase Mr Fud....it’s CitiBank that sucks! You make me feel.......BUUULLLISSH!!!������

They only “Lost”  if they sell now! (Remember ...buy low and sell high!!!) ....all they need to do is HODL until it gets to $20k
If you had bought Bitcoin this time last year you are 200% up....yes buddy!!......200%!
But if you buy for $10k and then you panic sell for $6k....you probably won’t be very happy and may resort to whining on Reddit???

Good lad! If you gonna go down, you gotta go down kicking and punching! This shit is just getting started... these guys told you to invest when it was all time high and now they telling you to sell! FFS. If this ship goes down we are all forked so just hang in there with the remaining $250 Billion of us!!!!!! I’ll see you in the beach at Christmas or in McDonald’s....enjoy the trip

Take a loan of $50k and put it all on Bitcoin and Zilliqua
You will buy a Mansion at the end of the year!

Don’t be silly and waste time at another job! Just get a rock solid loan and reinvest..,Zilliqua is gonna moon big time!! Why work when you can sit in the beach sipping Mojitos at Christmas time! On sunny days  of course! Start planning your Christmas vacation now and look forward to the good life! Don’t listen to these other clowns... they are on their way to their Friday evening Macdonalds shift. These same wingnuts were telling you to buy in December and sell
Now? WTF
Chill out and wait for the big spike man ��������
