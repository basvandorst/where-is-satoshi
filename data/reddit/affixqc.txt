I don't get it, what's the benefit over Coinbase?  Cheaper fees (btcquick takes a higher cut).  Giving them my banking details is the same as giving them my full identity.  I'd rather answer the standard loan questions (mother's DOB, last 4 of SSN, houses I've lived in, etc.) than give them direct access to my checking account.
Coinbase is already instant once verified.  It works great.  Can someone explain what I'm missing?

How is that clear?  What regulation are you talking about?
