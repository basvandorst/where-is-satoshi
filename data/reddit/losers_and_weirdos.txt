I have a little Trezor bumpersticker on my car. Maybe I should take that off...

Thanks for the info. I do own some actual Bitcoin already, unfortunately Coinbase closed my account and getting verified on another exchange seems like a real hassle. And I already have an account with Vanguard so I thought it might be an easy way to put some more $ into Bitcoin without actually buying more of my own directly...

Thanks for the info
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:43:29
How does this type of thing work? Has anyone here used it?
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:54:29
yeah, i get that and i already have Bitcoin on a hardware wallet as well as on my phone. However I'm still curious about how this type of fund works, how it relates to Bitcoin itself, and if it might be a worthwhile way to diversify my investment specifically in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:35:42
i mean its a funny comic but its exactly the opposite of what you should do. invest in BTC only what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2016-03-10 18:02:46
drugs, 2 venus fly traps, clothes, pay other people for stuff like when you split the cost of a meal
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:03:00
i just ordered two! paid shipping in bitcoin, easy peasy! thanks!
@_date: 2019-03-26 13:44:34
I was wondering about this, like after all the original BTC has been mined, maybe a new method of mining or rather "discovering" lost BTC can be established...
@_date: 2019-03-26 12:55:29
you have a lot more faith in people than I do, most of us seem pretty dumb to me ;) "basically indefinitely" is not the same thing as "indefinitely" though, there is a hard limit. a satoshi can not be divided any further. perhaps, as you say, if some new unit is created that somehow sub-divides the satoshi then it could continue more or less indefinitely.

I would think given that we are people it is our access to it that matters, not the network's. anyway... 
@_date: 2019-03-26 12:31:04
I'm not saying everyone in the world is going to loose all their Bitcoin all at once, of course most people will be smart about it. But still some small percentage will be lost every year. Since no more BTC is being created the logical conclusion seems to be that the supply will eventually diminish to close enough to zero to be effectively useless.
@_date: 2019-03-26 14:10:20
hey, thanks!
@_date: 2019-03-26 12:58:23
Oh, nice, I was not aware of that!!
@_date: 2019-03-26 12:27:25
LOL I never said anything about "our lifetime" I said "in the distant future"
@_date: 2019-03-26 14:10:52
I think this is sort of where my thought process is going now, that BTC as we know it will eventually be lost and the like ONE remaining bitcoin will be divided ad-infinitum through other yet-to-come solutions. But my original premise still stands, that most BTC could eventually disappear
@_date: 2019-03-26 13:36:30
yeah i get it, take away 10% of anything and you still have 90%. that 90% is going to get preeeeeettty small though after a long enough period of time

I had been using Coinbase regularly for about 3 years and was suddenly denied with no explanation. I emailed support and after a couple days got a canned "we're looking into it" response. When I finally heard back again after a few weeks they said the reason was that they needed proof of employment so they know where my money comes from. At that point I'd already moved on to Circle, and I don't plan to return to Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-11-10 17:32:41
i'd like some bitcoin please..?
@_date: 2016-12-22 11:16:02
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:43:57
how do you move btc to another wallet from Cashapp? I thought you could only buy and sell?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:52:53
Right now just making the general population aware of the existence of bitcoin is enough.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:25:59
i bought a venus fly trap with bitcoin, does that count?
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:24:44
i think just HODL is enough
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:18:07
The Bitcoin logo gets covered up though. If the point of this is to spread Bitcoin awareness I'm not sure this is the best design. Its nice and I like it, but yeah the logo gets covered up.

my brother bought his first half-a-bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:32:43
I've never had a problem either. BTW its just called Bread now, if you've still got something called BreadWallet you may be using an outdated version?
@_date: 2017-04-12 00:52:38
7 years isn't really that long. give it time. lets see what happens after 70 years. (i'll be dead, but hopefully my relatives will be rich with inherited BTC)
@_date: 2016-09-21 23:12:42
yes, coinbase support has historically been poor. In my own experience as well as in tons of other reddit threads about them. I've stopped using them and so have lots of others.

so phillybitcoinconsulting.com is basically just a link to coinbase?????

it was originally supposed to start in September. got pushed back to October. looks like its getting pushed to November now...
@_date: 2016-10-03 14:57:31
maybe its just me but I find it annoying. sorry.
@_date: 2016-10-03 14:50:53
is there a particular reason the stats don't show the time period on the bottom of each one, instead you have to mouse over it to see the information?
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:54:12
the very first thing that jumps out at me, not even having read any of the actual content yet, is that the site is called "how to buy Bitcoin" but the very first headline begins "How to buy Bitcoins". Not that it really matters, it just seems inconsistent to me.
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:29:35
Again this is a really tiny thing, but point  on the main graphic reads "Finally, deposit money onto the site and exchange it for Bitcoins." but that isn't the "final" step. You then have another sentence telling us to move them to an offline wallet. That's the "final" and possibly most important step.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:56:11
I'm no authority on this, but I asked a similar question recently and was told that having the 12 word seed is essentially the same as having the private key. If I remember correctly the reason you don't see an actual private key in Breadwallet is that the 12 word phrase can generate a number of different private keys which all point to your wallet. Or something.
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:15:09
lol thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:37:46
holy shit that little guy can jump!!!
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:06:49
there are a couple good points in this article, however its main conclusion seems to be "go google some other stuff until you find the answers you were actually looking for!" :P
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:26:26
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:19:51
yeah more info please
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:45:29
It does help, thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:19:50
Thanks for your reply - that's exactly what I was wondering: if the recovery process was at all standardized or it is tied to a particular app. So, if I just decided I didn't like breadwallet anymore I could theoretically use the same recovery phrase on a different app and have access to my same coin? That's reassuring! But wait, you said the current standard is BIP39, but, back to the original question, its about to change to BIP148, is it not? Will everything still "just work"...?
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:47:20
sorry if this is a silly question but is having your 12-word recovery phrase the same thing as having the private key? As far as I know bread wallet shows you the recovery phrase in the app, but I don't think the actual private key is listed. Does this question make sense?
