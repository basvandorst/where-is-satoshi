Bitcoin is the real money out of all crypto currency because it takes real money to create the currency everyday. It is the reserve currency of crypto. Bitcoin doesn't need to simply scale right now with a blocksize increase because that isn't a real solution it has diminishing returns. We are waiting watching and testing with the hundreds of core developers and lightning network engineers and RSK engineers wich will allow smart Contracts to work with bitcoin bitcoin is the fiat gateway to crypto. Bitcoin has value and so do other coins. But bitcoin is by far the most reliable and immutable blockchain on planet earth and thats why it is valued the way it is and fees are payed.

Scrub. Your using a centralized blockchain. It's shitty tech and that's why there are 2 devs working on it that nobody knows. All the bch nodes are hosted in China with servers anyone can buy and spool up to create there own node base. Get real.

Think bigger picture dude. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:16:26
So would this fee be bigger or smaller? Assuming bigger because there would be a lot of transaction data? But if this was the case where does the profit come in for LN hub operator, if the fees are big for on-chain settlement? Do they collect loads of little fees that make out to be bigger than the fee they will charge to settle on main chain?

If you are asking if I am selling my bitcoin the answer is no. I have never been one to trade my btc. Just a Hodler here.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:48:17
Well because I thought it was a good article explaining satoshis original vision. I did not know about Oliver being a bitcoin millionaire and that he likes to dump them. What would he dump them for cash? The article seems like he  want's bitcoin to succeed.

And a channel is essentially locking in transactions via contract so that they can be zero confirmations spendable? How will you view your transactions in that channel? Because right now I make a transaction and I can see it via block explorer. Will you have to have like a payment channel tx explorer and then check to see that the on-chain settlement was done via block explorer?

You run a node to keep the network decentralized first and foremost. Second it is the best wallet for securing your funds besides a HW wallet.  The Blockchain is currently around 100 gigabytes of storage. And if you have data caps with your isp than it is probably not a good idea to run a node as it could use up all your allotted data.

How is that subjective. Bcash is altcoin because it is not legacy chain...
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:05:56
lol yes
@_date: 2017-04-27 20:37:26
This transaction was probably very small. Witch means the fee was very small. It will take a long time for a miner to pick this transaction up and validate it because there are so many other "more important" (higher paying fee transactions) in the mempool.
@_date: 2017-04-25 00:07:35
No it implies the market cap.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:36:25
I LIKE THIS VIEW!
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:42:51
We will see you back if you leave. There is only one true coin that matters. Bitcoin the most immutable.
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:08:09
Lolz I feel the Same!

The Tech will be improved eventually due to market factors. Once mining isn't so profitable every large bitcoin bitcoin miner will vote for the right proposal that the community is running. Right now they are only looking short term and seeing gains from current prices and fees. If you know Dirty Jihan he is a large reason for this current setback. He is a short cited china men only eyeing new current profits. Not focused on future or health of the network like a miner should be. That is why he backs proposals like bitcoin unlimted. He wants to control this shit. Can't happen its bitcoin.

Coinbase is your way of exchanging btc for fiat to a bank account. Other than that the safest way to store your coins is btc core or electrum or hardware wallet like trezzor. Just remember you are completely responsible for your coins when you have your own wallet. Make backups. Use encryption. As long as you have the private keys you can always recover your coins. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:39:36
How could you have this much bitcoin and be so negligible to leave it on an exchange? Did you make all that money on the exchange because that makes no sense. I would be thinking about my btc all the time if I had that much on an exchange because you can never know what's gonna happen when you don't control your private keys. Where have you been we have been here all along telling people not to leave there coins on exchanges! 
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:28:59
If you have the private keys you own the bitcoin. No matter what happens to the phone. Just make sure you know how to import it into another wallet and witch wallets would work for your version of key.
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:17:21
Thanks this clears things up a lot!

Don't Forget to make sure you are running BIP148 Code 1.0 so that you are running the soft fork ready code for Aug 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:26:04
Perfect, I will now upgrade from signalling to enforcing. This is Awesome! 
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:25:16
I Used to really like the crypto show until I realized their complete lack of knowledge myself. Seems as though people like Ver and organizations like  DASH really like this show because they can influence people with little knowledge like the hosts themselves. Also commercials are super cheesy and annoying when they cut people off completely ruining the vibe and good conversation.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:11:32
Bitcoin is all about owning your own private keys and being your own bank. If you keep your bitcoins on coinbase they have your private keys and they have control over your Bitcoin. The day you go to log in to coinbase and realize that it is down will make it click in your head. Oh shit i cant move my bitcoin or do anything with it because the website is down. And let me tell you that site goes down when you want access to your coins.
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:15:03
Why because your IQ is to low to process that thought? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:52:20
yes 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:56:03
It's not about right now. It's about the future. Just like btc has always been! Just like there is no lightning network yet. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:26:29
As Donald J Trump would say. WRONG. Bitcoin will only ever have value if it is used as a commodity ledger.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:28:51
Or you could be a miner and actually validate transactions. Miners are the only full node. Running a full node essentially does nothing. You just Relay the transactions already found by the miners... This whole argument of everyone running full nodes making btc more decentralized is a joke. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:15:23
Meanwhile BSV is tackling Visa level Tx throughput with way more security. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:45:38
Yea and I am saying that you can do that without having to stifle the whole protocol and network so it works on a raspberry pie.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:22:10
We Should all love BSV. It has taken down or at least greatly hurt one of the most monopolistic companies in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:56:20
Imagine saying something constructive.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:43:31
How can we be sure it would be run like a project? As soon as btc goes to $1200 and everyone figures out that it has been stifled by the promise of lightning etc. Miners are going to switch to BSV because it will be more profitable and everyone will adopt it thus giving it more value and once people realize there is no ceiling the protocol wont be able to be change just like bitcoin is right now.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:40:26
Why not provide robust reliable scaling now on chain? So Bitcoin can actually have value and people can build on top of it without worrying about the protocol changing. The idea that everyone needs to be able to run a full node is quite frankly dumb. Computers and storage are cheaper and faster than ever and its only going to get more cheaper and faster as time goes on. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:37:11
Well BSV is currently at 64mb and or 128mb blocks shortly. From there it is going to 512 and soon 1 gb. If you do the math which i dont have time for right now, you will pass 2000-8000 tx a second in no time. Start looking into it and watching the coingeek presentations etc.
@_date: 2017-06-30 21:21:04
It depends. Mine did have quite a few last month before my full node became a non full node due to firewall problems. Now resolved thankfully. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:52:01
yes.
