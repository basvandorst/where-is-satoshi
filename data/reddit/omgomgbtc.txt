Also do you have account sharing? For example you use your email/username and passwords on multilple different websites?
For example LinkedIn or macrumors forums were compromised in the past, if you shared account data, like same password, that data is now compromised.

Try setting a 0.0001 mining fee, that worked for me.
I suspect the web interface cant detect that the transaction is too big without a fee and causes the error but im not sure.
Because i tried same transaction with Electrum and that gave an error about the size and fee.

I would not suggest an erase and wipe action and destroy all forensic evidence if you really want to know if your Mac was compromised.

I don't know, I did use my own btc address as well instead of the ones provided by blockchain.info so it might be related to custom/imported addresses. But I did solve my issue when specifying a fee, maybe try increasing it to 0.001 instead of 0.0001?

You can check from what ip addresses and useragents your gmail account was accessed, click last account activity details on the bottom right of gmail.
Else it sounds like malware, maybe you got some keylogging trojans.
Not sure if dropbox logs access like gmail does.
Also change passwords if you see that your gmail has been compromised.

I like it when developers take care of their unit tests!

Malware could also install a rogue CA certificate?

Where did you store your account information on the Mac? 1password or Keychain? Or just browser?
I'm not really familiar with Mac malware, but maybe you can check your crontab entries, suspiscious launchd entries or running processes. I dont think there are good Mac antivirus products but if you want to try I would suggest running the free F-Secure AV for Mac.
Another good thing to try is to close every app on your desktop to minimize network traffic and run tcpdump or wireshark to see if there is any suspicious network traffic. With lsof or netstat you can then check which process caused that network traffic.
Malware is bound to have a phone home abilty, possible over HTTP.

Thanks, but i think i will use bitcoinpaperwallet. Also, i can recommend you vanitygen, it's an offline bitcoin address generator where you can choose your own prefix. Gives it a more personal touch :)
I prefer to generate the keys offline as well for security reasons.
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:37:39
But maybe they don't want to share the WiFi password or the computer is not wireless.
And I don't trust opening up a browser and entering my passwords on their computer either.
The paper wallet idea is definitely a good option here, but maybe i forgot to prepare that or maybe it got all wet and unreadable :)
(I'm just thinking worst case here)

Im not saying they don't have internet, just not WiFi

Bruce Schneier knows the private key of your wallet
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:41:46
Just curious, how will you explain on how to use it?
@_date: 2013-12-28 19:46:00
Afaik the graphing is very limited and assumes most people use their own tooling for it by using the csv export.
I think it has GNU Plot support but is probably not very user friendly.

Thanks, definitely will use bitcoinpaperwallet.com if I go for bitcoin presents.
Just currently seeing some issues after giving bitcoins that it might be too hard to use or lose for less tech savvy people. I figured this subreddit might have some good alternatives or ideas to overcome this.
For instance blockchain.info website can scan QR code using HTML but only after you login. So there is no real quick way to verify a public key with the balance unless you type or scan and paste the QR code manually.
Maybe I should go for some more traditional presents.. :)

Bruce Schneier doesn't need an ASIC to mine Bitcoins, just a pen and paper.
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:41:27
No, but i did two transfers a few days ago without any fee. But that was a higher amount.
I used my own wallet address as the change address, could that be the cause?

I use a double accounting tool called ledger. Also using it to track my expenses and other stocks. It is a commandline tool though so might not appeal to everyone.
You can find it here: 
A good example on how to use ledger with bitcoin transactions: 
So if you like to be precise and correct use double accounting; use ledger.

I want to do this as well, what are you going to recommend them to use for managing their new bitcoins? Eg check the balance.
Blockchain.info website?
@_date: 2013-12-24 12:31:23
It was lazzerbee.com, but i would prefer to print my own

Why does Alice have to wait so long to verify Bob's transaction?
He forgot to tip..
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:45:23
Can you explain this a bit more? How is it different from a normal public bitcoin address?
@_date: 2013-12-31 13:18:51
I actually tried sending via blockchain.info but got weird error. Something about determinePrivateKeys() connected is null
So I wanted to try Electrum and see if it would work there. But at least I got a fee error with Electrum. I tried again with blockchain.info and 0.0001 mining fee and it got through.
@_date: 2013-12-31 12:13:00
Aha, it would be nice to show me this on why and where it is exceeding the limit. Or how I could calculate it myself showing the input data.
I'm doing something relatively simple, just sending from address to another address without any comment.
I will use a transaction fee now, but does that mean that the receiver is getting the amount minus the fee or is it subtracted from my own wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-31 12:30:30
I actually tried to verify the Electrum OS X client but it was signed by someone else.
Should I be concerned?
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:28:16
Guess that would work, Maybe create some smaller wallets so it does not contain a high amount of bitcoins.
And store the public+private keypairs in a keepass like application or any other secure password manager on your mobile device.
