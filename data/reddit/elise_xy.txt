Came here to ask about this.. what is going on?
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:18:39
Yes.. emotionally and support wise. Theres TONS of married people who don't share finances. 
Thats all i'm saying. 
Its not a rule that once you're married you share finances, it's just whatever you both decide on.

Jk, the bank didn't allow the transaction lawl

Theres no rule in marriage that says anything about funds being even. Pretty sure that is a decision that is different for every couple.

Mmmmm, salty tits. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:52

It's a joke man.

Yeah, being a newbie and owning only a fraction of a coin, this weekend has just made things bananas to understand. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:54:58
Yeah because no one ever got a job being talented at illustrating, or graphic design, or photography or retouching /s.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:02:56
Dude, what?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:29:11
For a newb here.. could you explain this a little more in detail?

This thread has taught me that Satoshi hasn't been identified. I had no idea!

Wait, so I've purchased from coinbase like 3 times now, it always gives me the summary "purchasing blah blah amount of btc for blah blah price. Will take blah blah days to clear"
You're saying that every though it tells me I'm buying at say $5500, that my purchase doesn't go through until the however many days later, at whatever price it is later??
