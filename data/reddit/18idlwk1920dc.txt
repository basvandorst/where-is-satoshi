Im not sure if my Trezor shows me the correct balance. Since my transactions were dropped from the Mempool they aren't reflected on my Trezor. The two transactions I sent are reflected as having left my Trezor even though they were never confirmed (as you stated, they were dropped), and this transaction, which links to my previously unconfirmed inputs, has not been recorded by my Trezor:

How do I do that?

When I try with Coinb.in it says "Missing inputs"
When I try with Blockchain.info it says "Transaction already exists"
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:05:58
So what do I do?
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:18:51
That's not true.... It only shows up as a segwit transaction if both the outputs and the INPUTS are segwit.
If you are going Legacy --&gt; Segwit, that's not a segwit transaction. Something else is happening.

The receiver is my friend, who sent me 0.14 BTC later that week with the unconfirmed inputs that I sent him. The difference between how much I sent him and how much he sent me is 0.08. Do I just get him to resend me 0.08 BTC?

On one of them I go up the chain and I get this:
A negative balance... The same is for the other transaction:

Who would do that? I swear half the mempool is fake transactions...
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:55:30
Thats the mempool. It is the amount of MB of transactions waiting to be confirmed ordered by fee level.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:23:39
I am the sender.....
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:41:35
Segwit --&gt; Legacy is also a Segwit Transaction? Where does it say that?
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:32:21
How do I scrape this information and put it in an Excel sheet? Ill give anyone who can help me do this $5 worth of BTC
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:26:22
It says "Please use a valid JSON.....
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:59:44
Damn, I thought it would be a 2 minute job :'(
