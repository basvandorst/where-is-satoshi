You’re not being double taxed. Let’s say you invest $100 in BTC, the value goes up to $1,100, you exchange your BTC for ETH, that ETH becomes worth $2,100, and then you sell that for USD.
You are taxed on your $1k BTC profit when you convert to ETH, and on your $1k ETH profit when you convert to USD.
If they didn’t consider BTC to ETH to be a taxable event, you would be taxed on... your $2k BTC+ETH profit anyway. Only difference is the tax bill comes in later.
Deciding to make up your own income reporting rules is generally frowned upon by the IRS, and you stand to gain almost nothing from it.

Business works the same way. Everyone who touches it gets a cut. And every business that touches a project has to take a large enough cut to satisfy their shareholders. Worse, they have to show constant growth, which means either increasing volume (unsustainable) or increasing their cut.
The government itself doesn't need any of those things, because it doesn't have shareholders and isn't looking to turn a profit.

It's about what corporations have that government does not: shareholders. A business needs to pay both employees and shareholders sufficiently, because if either group walks away, the business folds. The government doesn't have shareholders, so it's only paying employees.


You can do this in government. You think the US government has never fired anyone?
If you want to argue that the current US government doesn't do enough firing, or that they're too attached to their partners and contractors, then we can talk. But the options aren't the current US government or nothing--a more efficient government is possible. Is it easy? No. Can I tell you today how to get there and what the exact solution should be? No. But "let the free market handle it!" is an over-simplifying handwave. It substitutes simplicity for critical consideration of outcomes.
Let's try to create a more efficient government before we resign ourselves to "Well, this whole 'governmnt' idea failed. Let's privatize everything!"

Well, good job ignoring the two pieces I noted, both of which are, of course, unsolvable with the Bitcoin protocol. I also love this idea that a push protocol is immune from money laundering concerns. The only AML standard improved by Bitcoin is the public nature of the ledger--which is to say that Bitcoin's novel solution to money laundering is to have every party place every transaction in the public domain. Then you only need to know the identity of everyone using Bitcoin, and money laundering is easily traceable--what's that? Having everyone's identity known along with a public transaction log is a massive privacy concern? Well I never!


Oh that's adorable. A protocol where blocks confirm every ten minutes or so (but it could be up to an hour or more) is near-instant. So much more near-instant than the ten-second cap on debit/credit card processing.
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:20:19
That's not really a defense of the protocol, just a statement of demographic.

Welcome to wacky conspiracy-land, where only you and your small circle of compatriots are enlightened to the truth, and everyone else has been brainwashed!
And you are correct, education is funded by families. There are two major problems with doing this directly:
1. It immediately cuts off poor neighborhoods from even basic education. Their schools are underfunded even with government intervention... let's see what happens when we make the problem worse.
2. Education run and/or funded by a business is subject to the whims of that business. If Exxon runs education, we will learn about the greatness of oil. If Papa John's runs it, we will learn about the health benefits of pizza. You could argue that government-funded education will tend to be pro-government, but teachers are relatively independent (which is part of why tenure systems are important), which means that many will give you an education on alternative ways of thinking about government and critical thinking about the role of our own government. Private-sector schools won't have teacher tenure. Teachers will be strong-armed into teaching what the company wants them to teach.

suggests there's probably a much better reason you can't argue with me, such as not having a leg to stand on.
It doesn't take five days to settle a credit card transaction. After a 10-second confirmation, the funds transfer is guaranteed to go through, which is why they let you walk right out of the shop after you swipe your card and sign. There is no guarantee of that in the Bitcoin protocol--orphan blocks are a known issue inherent to distributed confirmation.
Chargebacks are possible for up to 90 days, and are consumer-friendly--they give the customer a fighting chance against fraudulent merchants. With Bitcoin, once you've paid, you're fucked. (see again: Butterfly Labs)

And the operative question is:
Who else is operating under the same bad assumption?
Remember, it has not been that long since Gox was known as the best, largest, and most reputable exchange. Clearly the community made some wrong assumptions... now it's on us to not make those assumptions again and get screwed by the next guy.

A lot of things don't come to their attention immediately. Most significantly, Bitcoin was pretty low-stakes until relatively recently, more of a curiosity than anything. Now the stakes have gotten a lot higher, and legal questions are being added to the mix, and I can understand a whitewashed brand like Apple wanting nothing to do with it.

I don't think they're fighting anyone, I think they don't want to be held responsible for anything that goes wrong with Bitcoin or with people's wallets.

You make an entire list of valid points. Public education needs massive reform. I just don't think that removing public education solves the problem at all. It seems likely to make education worse for those who still have access to it and nonexistent for those who don't.
Also, a lot of public schools are fine. I went to public school. So did a lot of other perfectly competent and free-thinking people. And a lot of us would argue that we wouldn't have picked up our skills and critical thinking ability without the school system.
Those schools do have their weaknesses, and can probably be run more efficiently, but I was arguing against them being "worthless" and producing "brain washed [sic] idiots", both of which are just slightly massive overstatements.

You're aware of the massive number of bad assumptions in that sentence, right?
e: Yes, I'm aware it's sarcasm. The problem is the number of ways in which it's a terrible analogy. Chief among them being that land is a resource with real and undeniable value.

Right, everything assumes stabilization. As long as the value is this volatile, it is merely an investment vehicle or transfer currency (convert Currency X to bitcoins, buy in bitcoins, seller converts to Currency X or Y).
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:33:10
Right. This is pretty definitionally a bubble. The underlying asset has a certain value in terms of its utility (probably around the value at which it was holding steady for some time), speculation drives the price up, which drives more speculation, which creates a feedback loop until speculators lose confidence and abandon it, at which point it returns to its utility value.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:34:59
Correct. And the value of Bitcoin for that use appears to be somewhere around five dollars. The fact that the underlying asset has actual value doesn't mean that the current price is at all reflective of that value. It's more likely reflective of about $5 of real value with $245 of speculative investment value on top.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:44:09


Approximate stable value of the currency once it reached what is likely to be relatively close to peak adoption as a transactional currency (rather than investment vehicle) in 2012. The gains since then have been investment-based; the lower price beforehand can arguably be attributed to lower adoption.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:30:53
The problem, of course, is that this type of exchange only requires Bitcoin to have a finite, positive value. Volatility doesn't matter, and the currency is only held for a few seconds, making it an immaterial investment.
Imagine the following scenario: Steve decides he's willing to buy and sell rocks for $1 a pound (but he'll only buy rocks he originally sold). To make money, he takes a 5-cent commission on every transaction. I buy a pound of rocks from Steve, use them to pay Jeff for a dollar store whizbang, and Jeff immediately sells the rocks to Steve for $1. Steve makes ten cents.
Tomorrow, Steve changes the price to $1 an ounce. Jeff and I could do the exact same thing, only the number of rocks changing hands would change.
Steve's rocks technically have value, but Jeff and I aren't affected by that value and have no effect on that value except to prevent Steve from giving up and going home. The only way I have an effect on the market or the market has any effect on me is if I decide to buy some of Steve's rocks and hang onto them for awhile to see if the value changes.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:06:49


The thing I find silliest about sentences like these (and I find them tremendously silly) is that they forget the other effects. Any event that triggers the collapse of fiat currency is extremely likely to also trigger the collapse of the world economy. At that point, it doesn't matter how many Bitcoins you have, because humanity is about to make a quick exit from the Electronic Age.
Of course, if you think only one fiat currency is going to collapse to sudden worthlessness, I'd love to hear which one. And if it's the US Dollar, I'd love to hear how the global economy is going to survive that one.

It is monumentally silly to assume one knows everything about something as massive and complex as currency systems and human rationality.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:03:06


Only if volatility is judged to be a downside. If most transactions are from risk-hungry speculators (and they are in this crazy environment), volatility is what they *want*--they want to see the price go flying around in random directions so they can sell as soon as it hits a relatively high value.
The low-volatility version of Bitcoin appears to be worth about five dollars, if the recent past is any indication.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:52:30
Well, arguably, this is currently part of the problem.
