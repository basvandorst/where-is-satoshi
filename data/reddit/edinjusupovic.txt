nah it doesn't do anything to Bitcoin but boy does it undermine Btrash™

yes that's called hedling, it's where you buy bitcoins but instead of hodling, you only held the coin for a short period, hence hedl.

Satoshi released Bitcoin with the intention of it being a "peer-to-peer version of electronic cash (which) would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"  
  
  
The sheer caliber of skill needed to produce something like the blockchain is phenomenal to grasp, so much so that people have speculated that Satoshi is actually an entire team of developers, lol.  
  
  
It only makes sense to think that someone with so much knowledge and raw skill could anticipate future scalability scenarios and as such, provide us with guidance on what to do. Payment channels, off-chain transactions and the lightning network were all suggested as options by Satoshi.  
  
  
Bitcoin is and always will be a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash, anything else is an added bonus.

Most of the live trading market is filled with bots doing the trading and not humans or at least human assisted bots at best. Coinbase has shown time and time again that it can and will halt trading by force if it needs to - so in the event of a mass sell off (i.e 'crash') they'll just pull the plug.  
  
  
  
The chance of a full blown security breach on Coinbase is so little it's not worth talking about :P

No - you need expensive hardware to mine said cryptocurrency, either in the form of ASICs or GPUs and the amount of electricity required would probably raise quite a lot of questions.

An investment in Bitcoin is an investment into the future of financial transactions online. Bitcoin, despite these trying and testing times, is continuing to flourish and the price of BTC is a reflection of that.  
  
  
The successful Segwit activation, positive lightning network testing combined with the increased worldwide media coverage has led to a network glut or slowdown; for which a solution is being rapidly developed against, hence the ouroboros like behaviour and continued price increases.  
  
  
Also, when you find out that Bitcoin isn't actually in any sort of bubble and is instead undergoing what financial analysts call an S curve; the puzzle begins to come together ;)

I store my coins at home. M3 explosion and bulletproof windows, all on reinforced metal frames, front door reinforced steel core with metal frame, 2x anti-tampering devices installed near main lock to prevent a crow bar trying to wedge itself in. There's another security door infront of the main door that locks itself into the metal frame of the entire door. CCTV all around the permitter that records into a NVR thats air-gapped but bolted down inside the houses roof. The roof is concrete tile with security bolts and anchors. The entire house, including walls and roof space is insulated with a insulation material that prevents all or most forms of digital signals from entering or exiting the house, there's no GSM reception inside the house but it's to prevent thermal imaging and eavesdropping. Also the standard - alarm system, etc.
  
  
The coins themselves are stored on paper, inside a bolted down safe, located inside a iron reinforced panic room that has a backup GSM 4G module with a powerful antenna that runs inside the wall adjacent to the panic room so the coin can quickly can be transferred out in a catastrophic event.  
  
  
I also have a guard trained rottweiler that I bought from a guard dog training centre.

The lightning network is around 12 - 18 months away but there IS a possibility we might see it in 3-5 months, maybe.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:28:10
It is not a safe setup by any means. Safe mode doesn't actually mean what you think it means and any sort of public network you connect your machine to is a risk.

I knew something smelled bad when it loaded up bitcoin.com, a domain hijacked by the BTRASH™ CEO Roger Ver for his fake cryptocurrency.  
  
  
This article is biased to the bone.  
  
  
EDIT: Hell. I'm not even sure why we still let articles from bitcoin.com on here :/
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:51:41
You misunderstand how payment channels function, your calculations about the maximum network transaction capacity with the current block size is wrong; you don't take into account atomic swapping with the lightning network, which will allow LN to utilise other faster, higher capacity blockchains such as Litecoin; which can then be interweaved with the bitcoin blockchain via the lightning network in order to boost total network transaction capacity of Bitcoin.  
  
  
It's worth pointing out that this is _exactly_ the reason why BCASH will cease to exist in the near future. Blockchain is not an efficient technology and will never be able to support all the transactions in the world - this is precisely why complex scaling solutions are required and not a increase-block-size-and-call-it-a-day solutions.

Do you work as a C++ developer IRL?
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:54:41
Once a transaction is initiated it's sent to the memory pool where it's distributed across a global network of full nodes; it then waits for a miner to include it inside a block. The problem is that a transaction doesn't stay in the memory pool _forever_, it actually gets dropped after a certain period passes - the default period is 14 days but nodes are free to configure different configurations should they choose to do so.
  
  
The issue is that it's generally not a best practice to rely on the maximum time it takes for a node to drop a transaction, it's very bad practice to rely on that because the full node configuration can very across the bitcoin network, especially with miners nodes.  
  
  
The other problem is that if you send a transaction with such a low fee it's very likely it'll never actually get confirmed or included in any block, because higher fee transactions are prioritised over your low fee transaction and thus your transaction wont ever be included, regardless of how long you wait; it'll probably end up being dropped from the mempool.  
  
  
When the lightning network is active these sort of issues won't plague us anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:44:59
Remind me how this related to Bitcoin again? BCASH is not Bitcoin. What you just did is the equivalent of posting about Bitcoin in the Dogecoin subreddit, it don't compute man

You've just hedled your first time, now the question is will you hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:11:14
It's not very expensive spam. Btrash have the support of miners, who likely engage in private agreements to gobble up the fees in their blocks while they spam the blockchain; thus, splitting the costs and in some cases even making an extraordinary profit off of the entire scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:13:24
Who cares? The people behind BCASH go nuts when you tell them that Litecoin, a much more trusted cryptocurrency with the same dev team as Bitcoin core has similar scalability solving properties that they claim BCH is godlike at executing - i.e Litecoin has faster transactions, four times the scalable capacity of Bitcoin, low fees etc. They pretty much shut up at that point and try find to find new excuses to justify the existence of their fake bitcoin wanna-be cryptocurrency while dismissing Bitcoin and any alternative scalability developments. 
  
  
Bitcoin scalability will be fixed with the increased adoption of segwit, which should reduce fees by around 40% - combined with the lightning network and other scalability-solving developments, we should quickly see the return of microtransactions, it's just a matter of developing very complex solutions which obviously need time.
  
  
The only reason BCH exists and continues to exist is because people like Roger Ver have very deep pockets to finance their circus shows and mass scams.  
  
  
  
The good thing is that people like Roger Ver are living in their own delusional la la land and should continue to do so for as long as possible. Bitcoin is too big for them to manipulate on the scale they want so it only makes sense they'd leverage themselves in a position to mass manipulate more people and markets, with a fake no-real-value cryptocurrency.

The solution is obvious; the BCASH party engaged us with operation dragonslayer, which ultimately failed. We retaliate with operation Deathwing. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:12:10
Alternative scaling solutions are being rapidly developed, see the lightning network. There's also a number of sidechain solutions being developed at the moment.  
  
  
Time itself is the only bottleneck at this point in time.

This is really a living demonstration of the extent that fake cryptocurrency, BTRASH™ will go to in order to drive and confuse more people, such unethical attention-seeking behaviour.
  
  
Btrash™ has _never_ been Bitcoin and it will never be Bitcoin. It's a fake cryptocurrency trying to steal the Bitcoin name that also happens to be controlled and centralised by miners, with a CEO called Roger Ver™.  
  
  
I genuinely must ask, does Roger Ver™ perhaps have some sort of dissociative psychiatric or mental disorder? he appears to be completely detached from reality by pushing campaigns like this out there.

Exactly. A free open market evolves and changes; BCASH and its supporters think that low fees are this amazing super-duper elite trait that make-or-break a cryptocurrency, yet seemingly forget their place in the world of cryptocurrencies. They're the neanderthals of the cryptocurrency world - truly misguided by only themselves and their illusionary quest to save Bitcoin.  
  
  
If you so much as mention the word "alternative scaling solutions" they'll go ape, logic just doesn't compute for them.

Not necessarily. This wont do any permanent damage; it instead costs the person who's executing this chain spam quite a lot of money and if anything this is actually a very healthy stress test for bitcoin because one day in the future bitcoin will have the same transaction throughput as this very attack - just without the attack and instead regular transactions.   
  
  
The blockchain will heal and only grow more resilient. The price of Bitcoin will increase to such a point where these petty attacks will no longer be viable.

Veracrypt was built and improved using the truecrypt codebase and as such, is generally seen as the replacement software for Truecrypt but in any case, as suggested theymos - you should be using symmetric GPG.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:45:08
I mean, currently the only solution I see is if you want your transaction processed quickly, pay more or else opt to have it processed more slowly and pay considerably less. Like right now, if I wanted to send a payment to someone and try to ensure it has 6 confirmations within the next hour or so, the average fee would be 3.73 USD; but if I could wait 24 hours (and assume it'd have 6 confirmations in 24 hours~) the fee becomes 0.40 USD.

Localbitcoins for BTC - you can meet in person and pay cash but if you're worried about anonymity, you could always mix/tumble your coins or use a coin that's more concentrated towards anonymity, something like Monero. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:07:13
You'll incur fees when you purchase bitcoin as you'll be paying with a credit card and then you'll get hit again with bitcoin network transaction fees when selling the purchased bitcoin and I'm not even taking into account any potential deprecation as a result of the volatile market.  
  
Paypal will take a fee but it won't be anywhere near the amount you'll pay compared to purchasing bitcoin and then selling it.

The sad reality is that the people with the skills required to develop and deploy these bots (properly that is) or finance such operations are likely smart enough to implement features into their bot so it looks like a completely natural account - one that you or me wouldn't be able to identify as a bot. The bots you're linking to look to be part of some sort of false flag or pseudo operation.  
  
  
You should probably stop wasting your time identifying the low hanging fruit, these accounts were created so you could identify them; a meer distraction at best.
