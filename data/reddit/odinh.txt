It doesn't matter if its compared to the rest of the population, because, by definition, they don't contribute to bitcoin.
At that point you should be comparing general wealth (property and currency), and I think you would then find even the top .01% of bitcoin holders don't stack up to the .01% of the total Earth population.

 Keeping a secret is easy when you might get insulted for it, but if you know you would receive praise? Keeping a secret like that is almost impossible for most men.
Makes you wonder if satoshi is still alive, or ever was alive.

You argument is hinged on the fact the either party in this discussion hold any wealth in bitcoin.
Seeing as how neither have made such a claim, this is an argument of perspective; of which he simply claims that making an argument now, either way, is without gain until more information is present.

Depends on the model phone. Some are pretty easy to root without compromising data.
Be warned, this image would contain your name, number, your phone book, keys for all the apps you have. Everything, it would contain your life.
Really, only do this if its your only option, and change all you other passwords as soon as the image is made.
Its a scary thing to do, so what I suggest is get with a techy friend who can root and dd image the phone. Then he can mount the image to his PC and run scapel to check for the file information your looking for.
I'll download the blockchain.info app when I get home from work so I can tell you where to look.

Hard drive fails? I use scalpel to recover the wallet file.
I'm much more okay with a broken drive than a ruined paper wallet.

... I'm trying to think of a way to help you without asking you to give too much access to your personal devices.
Honestly, with a dd dump of your phones internal memory, I should be able to recover the coins for you.
Don't trust me if you don't have to, but if all else fails, feel free to PM me.

You assume a lot.
Did you even visit the site he posted?  It's an alternative forum for bitcoin discussion.  It's range of content filtering is very slim, so I'm not a fan, but it's still there.

My phone just really seems to like 'fait' over fiat.

Am I the only one around here who thinks were shouldn't be giving the 'average joe' a pass on learning good cryptography and digital security?  Am I the only one who thinks this is a step, and should be something everyone needs to learn, like they learn to format a check book?

I love his enthusiasm about Bitcoin. Its good to see people speak so openly about the new world of Bitcoin, and accept it.

No one told you you had to feel a certain way. If you like to see price updates, down vote and move on. I don't, so that's why we are here, isn't it?
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:35:55
By that definition, everything is fait, and so labeling something as fait really means nothing. So, I'm inclined to not like your definition.

A quick [whois]( gives us some names and a company.
Sandra Frisch and Mark Karpeles at Key-Systems GmbH
It's nameservers are cloudflare servers, so not much help there.

If I was Satoshi, reading the comments here, i would have a smile ear to ear, and having a really hard time not being overly pleased with myself. Just saying.

Nope, just went up again a few minutes ago.
A ban would not result in a 502;

Let me rephrase:  It's ability to filter content into a more easily explored system is weak.  It's a single tag system, that filters on by that one tag, and only one tag per page. That isn't a very fluid or helpful interface system.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:38:33
Easy solution: Don't use bitcointalk.org.
I don't agree with Theymos on just about anything, however, I don't think your placing the blame where blame is due.  More over, unless you can prove TradeFortress knowingly stole those coins from his/her users, your article is rather slanderous.
But you know, lets all just go get our pitchforks and torches.  Every time something bad happens, it's always easier to blame someone else than ourselves.
Hopefully this is serve as a warning to incoming bitcoin users: it's decentralized for a reason, don't go around trusting the first guy you see with your coins.

One line, in an entire article mate.  That's my point.  It's nothing more than a passing mention in the article.  I was addressing the article, not a single paragraph in said article.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:57:40
And there is a problem with commenting on an existing price post?  Everyone needs to make their own?
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:56:37
Yeah, it's a thing

I agree, I have been using Google Cache for the info I need, but I don't think the new influx of users will know, or be willing, to do the same.

You know what else was nonsense?
* [Heliocentrism](
* Any revolution before it happened (really, just pick one)
* The idea that matter was made of time subatomic particles
I, for one, will spend my efforts adding "Bitcoin as a world currency" to then "was nonsense" list.

The selfish mining seems to be not much more than a passing mention in the article.  Are you sure were reading the page?
