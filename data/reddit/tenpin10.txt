Think of a consortium private digital ledger as a government application, processing clear and coloured blockchain token applications - and its value becomes obvious. 
The consortium may be the central bank of country XYZ and each of its states, republics, or provinces; with each node also doing the check functions for the entire consortium. The coloured token applications could be property records, state savings bonds, or even medical records - for every citizen in country XYZ.
And all records immutable, extremely accurate, transparent, and residing on a platform that is very very robust.

If you are running a sophisticated data base you may well be able to run a block-chain equivalent a lot more efficiently, but it would seem that it is ONLY if the smart contract uses the available database fields. If every contract is customising differently, the choices are to either add new fields or reject the contract; is it not ultimately a capacity issue.

By itself; using the distributed ledger as a payment system, doesn't really add anything. We change inputs, and processing, but the output remains a payment - same as we can do already through any existing bank.
But as a business platform we get value out of the blockchain multiple ways; ability to rapidly process over a range of volume, variability, variation, and visibility; lower record keeping cost; higher dependability; higher flexibility; high quality data; and faster speed.  
Quite a bit different from the standard database approach.
