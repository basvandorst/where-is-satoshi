There is 0 [sic] proof that he said it?  Its on his twitter account.  Oh wait, the Reddit twitter bot even quoted it under my post.
What are you getting so hot for?  There are a lot of r/bitcoin folks who say this every day: some other coin is for small transactions, BTC is for big transactions.
Now, if LN takes off, BTC could be the coin of the people, but for now, it doens't work to buy coffee.

A wallet (one that only you have the keys/seed) on your smart phone is pretty fool proof.  The program is stored on the program side of the partition - it is difficult (if not impossible) to hack.  The biggest vulnerability is phishing, loss of password, etc.

@_date: 2017-11-01 22:02:56
Yes, I see that, the difficulty rate is 1.4 vs .113
From what I understand, because of the lower BCH price, it would be difficult to attract miners - and they came up with the EDA.  In doing so, it is almost as if they bribed the miners to come over?  This is either very sneaky, genius, or both.  
So why not make bitcoin's difficulty easier?  With increased # of miners you have more competition, faster turn time and lower fees, no?

Thanks for your comment - sounds good.  I read, before the Aug fork that BCH would have lower fees and a lot of folks here said it was a lie.  And today:
BTC    Avg. Transaction Fee	5.22 USD
BCH    Avg. Transaction Fee   .085 USD
I was watching some Youtube videos of the original on air bitcoin transfers and they were bragging that you could send money around the world for practically nothing.  It is getting up there in price and the chart is in an uptrend.  This paper suggests that this is by design.  You say its an engineering objection - an objection to lower send fees?
So how is it that bitcoin cash can do it for 8 cents?
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:22:14
You will mark one transaction as BTC and send it to a BTC wallet.  You will mark another transaction as 2X and send it to a 2X wallet.
There will be procedures for doing this - I just saw one solution pop up 20 mins ago - not ready yet but many will be:
You might even be able to send the to coinbase the day after, split them and then send back to your personal wallet.

Lets change your question to cash, because crypto is really online cash:
I've been wondering if there is any ~~cryptocurrency~~ cash with a fraud prevention mechanism.
Yes, don't give your cash to anyone you don't know or don't have recourse with (don't send your bitcoin to someone if you don't have recourse with them or they don't have a good reputation).  Store your cash (keys/seed) in a safe place = buy a safe or put it in a safe deposit box.  Get a home alarm.  Get a dog.  Don't leave it (keys/seed) laying around.  Don't carry it (keys/seed) with you (no pin on smart phone, no trezor, no encryption).  Don't advertise that you have a lot of it (at the bar, on Reddit, etc).  Don't invite strangers into your home (use Windows, store passwords online, leave key/seed on table when maid cleans house).

I see a new opportunity for some traders and programmers.
In the real world, changes like this are exploited through arbitrage.
Traders hold positions in Bitcoin, EUR, &amp; USD.  When one moves like this and the other doesn't, they sell bitcoin into dollars and then buy Euros.
IN TIME, this will disappear as arbitrage traders take advantage of these discrepancies and profit from them.
Today, the price of gold in London is the same price as it is 500 KM from the nearest airport in the jungles of Africa.

I'm talking about the miner fee to send your bitcoin.  If you exchange $4,200 to 1 bitcoin and then send it, you might pay a buck in transfer fees.  If you convert $10 and then send .00000xx, you'll still pay a buck.  Add up a bunch of .21 cents + .35 cents + 82 cents into a fraction of a coin and then send it and you'll get a whopping transfer bill.
Just yesterday I read about a guy who received $34 or so in mining fees but because he's paid the coin in small little bits, when he went to send it to his wallet the transfer fee was $17.
I suppose, if you let this app add up all of your change and you only take it out (in coin) once every 6 months or so it might work.  But if they're sending you coin every day, you're going to get eaten alive in transfer fees.

Whether it be for the S2X bullshit [challenger coin that is forking (splitting) bitcoin into two separate coins: 1X (bictoin) and 2x (Segwit S2X) - the former is supported by a majority of bitcoin holders and the bitcoin programming team, the latter by a lot of miners and people who feel that the programmers are using bitcoin as their private tool that they can sell access to), or the fact that 90%+ of hashing power [mining efforts / computing power to mine] is centralized in the bitmain cartel [google: bitmain], we need a PoW [proof of work] change that can sustain the effects of ASIC [specialized chip that can process bitcoin mining operations and makes regular CPU/graphics mining obsolete - ASIC cards are difficult and expensive to acquire and (many believe) centralize mining efforts] manufacturing. Equishash [no clue] is NOT the answer, and Core's focus needs to be aimed at an ASIC resistant hashing function.
We now see the true effects of what a 51% attack could mean [someone has control over 51% of mining computers and can alter the chain to "steal" bictoin]. A ASIC-resistant, or ASIC-impossible solution needs to be found. We're looking at having Bitcoin taken from beneath us if we don't act now. And this will NOT be the only attack we will see in this style. Core [a central group of programmers who write most of (all of?) the bitcoin program code] has a responsibility to Bitcoin to put their effort into this.

your comment does't really address the OP's question - at the same time, we see a $100 drop in the USD rate and only 2 EUR.
You could, if you owned all three, sell one into the other and then transfer to the third and make an instant profit.  If you did it with leverage, you could make a sizeable profit.  That this discrepancy exists = this is not happening on a mass scale yet.
If a = 1, b = 2, and c = 3, you can't have a + a = 2, b + b = 4, yet, a + c = 4.1 for very long before someone starts scalping the .1

If the US dollar goes up by 20% against the pound and the next day, the Fed creates 20% more dollars, the dollar price to the pound will go back to the day before.  You just have more dollars, that are worth 20% less.
There are ~ &lt; 6 million bitcoin holders.  There are only ~20+ million bitcoins.
What happens when 100 million people want to buy a bitcoin?  Supply and demand, the price goes up.
With the dollar and the fractional reserve system, if you build a $50,000 house on top of a $50,000 piece of land that can sell for $200,000, you can get a loan for X% of $200,000.  That $200,000 is created just like a paper ledger entry in Monopoly.
With the bitcoin, limited supply pushes price.  With unlimited supply, a dollar is a dollar is a dollar.  When you add in Fed printing to fund unlimited government waste, you get even inflation wherein a dollar is 90 cents is 80 cents, is 70 cents.

EVERY country has rules and requirements for citizenship in their country.
Born in England to illegal immigrant parents?  You don't get UK citizenship.
Born 1 meter in the US after your Mom waded the Rio Grande in ankle deep water?  You're entitled to a US passport.
Born to a US parent and a foreign parent in a foreign country - you're entitled to US citizenship so long as your American parent recognizes you and registers your birth with the embassy.
Live in some countries 5 years (as a legal resident) or 10 years and you can apply for citizenship.
Invest in a country, you can get citizenship.
I know of folks with 4 and 5 passports.
I have legal residency in 3 countries and am waiting out the clock for my 2nd and 3rd passports (3 years and 8 years respectively).
As a US citizen, you can have citizenship in ANY number of countries.
As a German citizen, if you take citizenship in another country, you lose your German citizenship (same is true of Monaco and some other countries).
Some countries WILL NEVER GIVE YOU CITIZENSHIP.  I know a girl in Kuwait, her GRANDARENTS were born there and they all still have Syrian passports.
Dual citizenship is a good idea.  If you have any way of obtaining a second passport, do it.  You never know when some Hitler will take power and you and your family might be on a short list.

I see what is the problem here.  You seriously think I'm trolling.
[Edit to add: you can see [here]( and [here]( that I am not trolling].
I really think that you, and many at this sub, need to take a step back and realize that every question is not a troll.  You feed right into the r/btc camp who say that this place is censored and stifled.
No.  Not trolling.  I read things at r/btc and I do what I was trained to do at Uni.  How to you find the truth?  You question everything.  You ask pointed questions, you fact gather and see what sounds logical, what sounds reasonable.
Each of my questions, I'm asking you, "So, I read at this other sub this and that, I'm not sure what to believe.  Please explain it to me."
I hate to break this to you, but there are a 1,000 + of me out there who are seriously confused as to what is propaganda and what is truth.  You labeling everyone as troll or concerned troll accomplishes nothing.
I have not been impolite or hostile to you yet you call me ignorant, call me a troll, etc.  If we were at a cafe, having a beer or a coffee and I said, "Satosh, I don't know you too well, but you're a bitcoin guy.  I was talking to this guy, his name is Roger, and he told me this.  It concerns me, what should I make of it?"
You mean to tell me that you would say I'm an ignorant troll and get up and walk out of the cafe?
So, because we're talking via the net, why do you have such liberty to be so rude?

And, if the "true" price of BTC is $100,000, speculate away.
"A lot of people think, “Speculation? Oh, that’s gambling.” Well, actually no. Speculation is allocating capital not to create more capital, but to take advantage of distortions and misallocations created in the market—usually by government interference. Gambling is to engage in a game of chance—roulette, dice, or the like. Since most people in the markets have no idea what they’re doing, they actually are gambling—just using their brokerage house as a casino. Perhaps that’s why people conflate the two things."

Lets rewrite your comment:
"I hate to be a downer but I've been involved in CASH since 2012 and this is the reason that it will never reach mass adoption. Using, holding, having, buying CASH is fucking stressful, risky and dangerous and it takes a certain technological ability to even have the confidence to take it on. These stories drive even more fear than the volatility.

Agree completely.
Lets break it down purely from supply and demand (leaving the emotion of bitcoin vs. btc out of the equation).
This week alone, two more companies are freeing up their BCH.  If 1/2 of those folks dump = downward pressure.
We have days wherein there is almost no computing power allocated to BCH = someone could 51% hack the system and bankrupt a few exchanges and destroy BCH
[exchange a million bucks in BCH to BCT then alter the record and wipe the sale of the BCH]
Coinbase (and they're one of the biggest) will allow its BCH to be taken out in Jan 18 - this could have another massive push down on BCH.
Despite all of these downward pressures, if it ever does get to $500, some of the early miners have breakeven points at around $500 and they might just be waiting to get out.
All said, with downward pressure &amp; holes in security, the bottom support for BCH is, well, nothing.
The cap to the upside, for the time being, is about $500.
so, you have about a 13% upside and a 100% downside.

This is why bitcoin will go to $10k, and then $25k, and then $100k
When the US dollar hyper-inflates, and it will - its inevitable, people will swamp the gold stores and exchanges.  When gold sells out, BTC will be purchased wildly.  
It will make the dotcom bubble and the current rise in BTC seem like a road bump next to Mt. Everest.

So if you had just used your $60 to buy dash, you would have ended up with $981.
it seems to me, the more and more I read, that much of the mining "profit" is just because of the run up of the underlying currency.  If bitcoin was still at $1,200, I think that many of these contracts wouldn't even be at break even.

Stocks are driven by earnings and news.
Microsoft is paying a 4% dividend at 100 per share ($4 dividend) and they increase their dividend to $5 (20% increase), soon after, we'll see the price of MSFT rise to $120 and the dividend will return to 4%
Tesla has not and might not ever return a profit.  It burns through billions in research loans.  And yet, the stock is always going higher - on the "anticipation" of some new product (news).
Bitcoin is not an investment.  It is a currency.  It is a commodity.
In places (like Venezuela) where there is hyper-inflation, hard currency fetches a premium because there is a shortage of it.
There is a much greater demand for a "stable" crypto-currency in the world.  Much, much more demand than we see now.  If people have FAITH that it won't crash, you'll see billions more pour in.  As organized crime figures out how to use it more effectively to move billions around the world, you'll see billions more pour in.
Apple's price grew based on its massive profits.  The profits are a result of selling millions of iPhones.  Before the iPhone, there was no demand.  The profit was CREATED by creating the product.
There is a NEED and a desire for this bitcion currency/commodity.  People will pay a premium for what it can do (hide money, move money, safeguard money).  Until we reach a saturation point, the price will continue to grow and grow, as it has done.
I will not be surprised when it hits $5k.  It will.
I will not be surprised when it hits $10k.  It will.
I will not be surprised when it hits $100k.  It will.

At first glance, you are trading one seed for a password.  To prevent password hacking, it needs to be long and complex, like a seed.  Your family might forget.
But, if you keep this QR code out of sight (only in a safe box), then you could have a very simple password.  It could be your dog's name.  Anyone who examines your box won't know what the QR code is, only your heirs.  And they will know the password.
If you wanted a strong password, you could agree on a sentence to be used as a password and share it with your family.  "Our first vacation was to Florida in 2009."  That would be a hard password to break but something that everyone could remember.  Heck, you could write it on the wall as a caption on a photo and you would still be safe.  No one could access the QR without your death, and no one who accesses your box can access the key without the passphrase.

This is either FUD or misinformation.
This argument is missing a key piece of economic information in this equation:
It doesn't matter if they print a trillion in tethers, its who takes them as payment is who's going to get burned.  If the $25 million was just "minted," they use it to buy BTC.  Who's selling the BTC?  Someone.  They are getting tethers in exchange.  If and when this blows up, the holders of the tethers will be burned.  Won't effect the price of bitcoin at all.

A few reasons for the rise in BCH:
1.  Most of the selling from exchanges (people received the airdrop) have finished.  We can expect to see more downward pressure in Jan when Coinbase finally releases theirs.
2.  It is getting used for commerce.  More and more businesses are taking it.  So many hodlers are proclaimed that BTC is a store of value, not for folks making &gt;$2 a day.  And so, people are now using BCH to buy coffee.  When you use it back and forth and then you want to buy some Iota or Monero, why convert your BCH to BTC.  Just buy with BCH.  And so, more people holding it incidentally and accumulating it in business sales.  All it takes is a slight rise in price and people will hold it to spend next week.  The cycle continues.
3.  Some folks are nervous about the next hard fork and are looking for other places to take some profits offline.  BCH has shown a very strong support at $300 (the "break even" point for many miners and backers).  And so, if your low point is $300 and high point is &gt; $300, why not use it to trade Alts and to sell coffee?
4.  Gains beget gains.  Price goes up, more people are convinced and jump on the wagon.  Not unlike BTC.

I think you have it backwards.
A stock correction is not imminent. 
A currency correction is imminent.
The US has over $20 TRILLION dollars in debt.  The average interest paid on this debt is ~ 2%
While US debt spending only takes about 6% of the IRS loot, this figures at an interest burden rate of 2%
What happens when China comes online with their oil for Yuan Shanghai exchange next year?  Oh, you don't want Yuan for your oil?  That's fine, the contracts are CONVERTIBLE TO GOLD.
What props the US dollar is that it is the required payment medium for oil purchases.  And now, you can sell your Iranian/Russian/Venezuelan oil for Yuan.
Some folks start to sell dollars, start to sell bonds, what happens?  When bond yields go up, bond prices go down and vice versa.  So, when people start selling US bonds, the yields GO UP.  If no one wants to buy US bonds, the ONLY WAY the US.gov can sell them is to raise the rates.
And, when they raise the rates, the 6% of Federal budget to debt goes to 7%, then 8%, then 9%
And then, people start to wonder, what if interest rates return to their "normal" 8% and the US debt budget is so big that they can't pay it?  I don't want to be the last guy holding ~~Bitconnect~~ dollars, I better get out before this ~~Ponzi~~ system collapses.
As more and more people sell, bond prices collapse and interest rates skyrocket.
Think back to the '70's - 15% bank loans to buy a house.
What will the US do to sell bonds when they have to float T-bills at 15% and this eats up 42% of the Federal budget?
Well, they can't default.  So, they'll just print more money and pay off the bills with the "extra" cash.  Inflation begets inflation and soon you look like Venezuela.  
No one wants to hold cash.  Inflation means everything goes up in value.  A $4 gallon of milk is now $10.  If you had bought milk, your $4 would now be $10.  How do you "lose" your cash?  You buy houses, gold, STOCKS.
I think, what we will see is a rise in the price of stocks.  But, a nominal rise in the price against an inflated dollar.
This SHOULD HAVE happened already.  Those slick dicks over at the Federal Reserve staved off disaster by printing trillions of dollars and using the money to buy US bonds with it.  It really is like losing your job and when your house is about to get foreclosed on, you whip out a credit card and pay the mortgage but go deeper into debt.  This will work and work until it doesn't.  And when it doesn't, think pre-War Germany, Argentina, Mozambique, Venezuela...  If we have trouble again, and the Fed prints more and saves the system, people will STILL want BTC because of the inflation of the dollar (more dollars chasing fewer goods).
To sum up: will $ flood into BTC if this scenario ever plays out?  BTC will go up faster and quicker than gold.  Why?  Because you can buy it instantly.  Once the local coin dealer sells out, you have to order it online and wait a few days for it to show up.  And, the government might take it from you.  Should the dollar ever fall from its lofty perch, I'm sure we'll see $100,000 BTC.

Update on 24th October 2017:
To avoid the confusion in the bitcoin community which could seriously affect the bitcoin ecosystem, we have made some revisions to our stance above. **We will be treating the legacy bitcoin blockchain (present bitcoin blockchain that is supporting 1MB blocks) as the bitcoin (BTC) and will be allowed to trade for INR.** The forked coin which is the result of the SegWit2X implementation will be treated as the minority chain coin (B2X). We will be allowing the B2X to be withdrawn by our customers after the split as per the timelines above.

You will see 10x, maybe 100x - for the reason of supply and demand.  Sure, maybe you could cut one bitcoin into a billion pieces.  But the people who sell BTC want a higher and higher price to exit.  And people who are buying are increasing in numbers.  Millions, no billions, will pour into BTC in the next year.  If no one is selling, where do you think the price will go?

I discover a gold mine and I'm able to extract $25 million in gold nuggets.  I then trade these nuggest for $25 mil in bitcoin.
The bitcoin seller puts the nuggets on a ship headed for Panama.  En route, the ship is lost at sea.
What happens to the bitcoins?
They all drop in value because the purchase medium was made valueless?
OK, lets say the nuggets were fake.  I bought $25 million in bitcoin, put it into a cold wallet and then the seller finds out that they are gold PLATED nuggets.  What happens to the bitcoin?
Again, nothing.

This brings up an interesting question.
The gov may know when you bought your bitcoins, but they don't have to know when you sell them.
If they go into a wallet when you buy them, and two years later, when you sell and the price is 3x higher, the gov knows exactly what you owe.
But, what if you do this when YOU BUY:
1.  Open a paper wallet.
2.  Buy the same amount of Monero that you want BTC.
3.  Send it to a converter site (about 2%) they turn your Monero into BTC and send it to your wallet.
You now have untraceable BTC.
Should you sell it later (years later), what you owe in taxes is between you and God.
To the gov.gov, it looks like you bought Monero and spent it the next day.

1.  I just learned about USDTs this week (US Dollar Tether).  Some genius wanted to be able to transfer crypto that had no currency trading risk to the US Dollar - in other words, they wanted a crypto that had the SAME price as the US dollar and didn't waver.
So, they trade just like a bitcoin but are always worth $1.
You can read about them here:
And so, some company could make coins, paper (or plastic) money, or a card that cannot be counterfeited (or difficult to counterfeit) and have it worth x number of bitcoins (or decimal thereof) and circulate them as physical currency.
You could always verify them by putting their serial number (address) into a web checker and verify that it is good.
The issuing company would keep, on reserve, the same amount of bitcoin as the coins/bills/cards that were issued.
2.  I could also envision a chipped card that has in it the address and key of the coins, encrypted, and the chip is blocked unless a pin is entered.  You could sell them in $10, $20, $50, $100, etc - and a merchant could charge against them for a certain value after you insert the card and enter your pin.  The machine would prompt the chip to release said # of bitcoins and the chip would authorize the wallet to release said number to the address of the merchant.

Some people are Americans and can't keep a "regular" account at Bitfinex.  So, they lie and open a non-American account.  So long as you don't trade in dollars, they don't care.  You have to fund your account with something.  BTC is too expensive so, they use ETH or Lightcoin.  Well, why not BCH?

Just put the actual bitcoin address/key on a USB file and encrypt it and then put in the safe deposit box.  Then add some family photos to the USB.  Give your family the encryption key.
Your family can't access the safe deposit until you're dead.  Probate/court officials can't access the file on the USB and will think its just a photos USB.

Wrong answer to put the key in the safe deposit box.  In probate, your box may be opened in front of a court or probate officer.  You just made your "offline" bitcoin a public record &amp; taxable event.
Better yet, encrypt the key and put the key on a USB and then in the safe box.  Then give the USB encryption key to your loved ones.  They can't use the key until you're dead and they get access to the box using your death certificate.
On the encrytped thumb drive with the key, put some family photos and a note or two.  Write on the thumb drive, "family photos."  If a court officer pops it in the computer, they will see the photos and maybe a scrambled text file.  Your family will get the drive, they will have the password and you'll be good to go.
In this way, you will always have access to your wallets.  Just update your safe deposit box thumbdrive with new wallet and 2FA keys as they change.  Your family will always have only the file decryption key.  You remain in control and no one can touch your coin until you're dead.
Edit to add:  If you're not comfortable with a USB or CD - you can make encrypted paper seeds using this program:
Choose a password that is easy for your family to remember.  Here is an idea, your name, your dad's name, grandfather's name, mom's name, her father's name, etc.  You could use the first names of everyone in your family tree - something not easily found by anyone but your family.
I've been using the program all afternoon - works great (offline) - and its free!

I completely disagree.
And, I'm upvoting your comment.
I respect your opinion even if I disagree with it (or think I do).
I think that all of these sidechains will lead to monopolies that will, in the end, be bad for BTC.
However, I don't know for sure.  And, I don't think that anyone is the boogey man if they think differently than me on the subject.
I own some BTC and some BCH.  After the Nov. fork, I'll hold both and see how it plays out.
I think, in a perfect world, BTC, 2x, &amp; BCH will all be viable and will all fit their specific niche.  BTC will go on and on and will climb higher regardless of these forks.  For a time.  Or not.  If the market annoints BTC, it will go to $50k.  If 2x, then it will.  But I think all 3 will survive in their own way.
I don't see why everyone has to sling mud.  The market will decide, not all of our teeth gnashing and arm wringing.

Regarding using a hardware wallet for day to day moving of funds - why not a wallet app on my smartphone?
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:50:40
That exchange it totally legit.
It was started up by an African Prince and an African Army Colonel.  
The Prince was locked out of his kingdom and, through the support of many fat women in American and the UK, he was able to retake his throne and he used the gold coins in the basement vault to pay for 1/2 of the exchange.
The Army Colonel found that a rich British family died with no heirs.  He needed a white stand in to accept the inheritance.  He emailed, literally 343,284 people at random before some lucky bastard accepted the offer and claimed the inheritance.  The lucky bastard and the Colonel split the $7.4 million equally.
Now, the Prince and the Colonel have donated several million each, to the exchange, and have promised to take no profits whatsoever.  They are doing this for purely altruistic reasons and they hope that they can bring wealth and prosperity to their countrymen.

Yes, and this fallacy is often applied to investing.
Hindsight is ALWAYS 20/20.
Is the quick jump 4k or 40k?
It has been PROVEN over and over again, that buy and hold beats market timing every time.
Women, on average, make more $ in the stock market than Men.  Why?  Because they don't market time and win in the end.
How many sold BTC after a "quick crash" and then missed the next big rally?
The only real proven timing technique has been to liquidate if your stop loss is hit (say 20% loss) and sell 1/2 when your $ doubles.  In this way, you have your original investment and the rest is pure profit.
There is very little difference in the pricing of Bitcoin vs. many other stocks.  It all comes down to utility + supply &amp; demand.

All coins and bars can be easily verified (out of the packaging).

It doesn't matter if they print a trillion in tethers.  For every transaction, there is a buyer and a seller.  Someone accepted tethers for their BTC.  If the tethers are fake or fraud, it will be the BTC sellers who eat it.

I talked to some guy a few years ago - when I was convinced BTC was a bubble.  He said, "Put $1,000 in, if it goes bust, count it as a week in Vegas.  You might get rich."  I laughed at him.
I'm not laughing any more.
And so, if I put in $5k and it goes to 100 or 500, I will be laughing then.
But, I'm spreading around to some other coins as well.  I find particular promise in Monero.  BTC was the Silk Road exchange medium back in the day because it offered some anonymity.  When Silk Road busted, BTC fell and returned later.
Monero is quite a bit more anonymous and with each new Silk Road that opens, dealers are either trading in Monero or else laundering their BTC in Monero exchanges.  I see that it has the potential now to be like BTC in a few years.

I worked as a financial planner for the better part of a decade.  I saw a phenomenon that occurred again and again and in the public sphere, we can see it play out every day.
**When people inherit money or receive a windfall, they try to reset their life back to the "comfort of poverty."**
Most people's net worth is close to what they believe it should be.  Not what they want it to be, what they INTERNALLY believe it should be.  If you believe you're a millionaire, you'll probably start a company and earn a million.  You win the lottery and you feel you're worth $84.13?  You'll blow your winnings in less than 5 years.
For those of you instant millionaires that invested in Bitcoin early, realize that your ego and subconscious are not comfortable.  They want you to be in your "safe zone," and this is a "poverty zone."  Your brain will do its best to sabotage you in every way, including getting you to leave a half million in bitcoins on your computer.
Take a look at so many basketball stars, actors, musicians, etc., and see how they go broke in no time.  It isn't just because they don't know how money works, for MANY PEOPLE, the idea of having a lot of money is a terrifying prospect for their subconscious.
I had client after client after client, get a hold of their rolled 401(k) and in 9 months they turned $300k into nothing: scams, stock trading, real estate investments, etc.    "Why isn't a Lamborghini an investment?"  
Inheritance?  The smart old money sets up trusts and doesn't allow the foolish kids to blow the family fortune.  And when I say, "Kids," think of this line:
"The first 50 years of childhood are usually the hardest."
And so, if you're a Bitcoin millionaire, go and fetch yourself a copy of Napoleon Hill's "Think and Grow Rich." (it's out of copy-write for over 50 years so you can download a free .pdf copy)  Start using his auto-suggestion techniques and re-program your subconscious that you are a millionaire.  In time, you'll take on the persona of a millionaire and you'll instinctively work to protect and GROW your assets.

If you run a company that sends money from the US to Mexico or UK to India on behalf of workers, you have to send that money, via a bank wire, and pay fees.
If you can cut those fees by 20% or more, by trading outside of the bank wire process, and pass savings along to the worker, why not?

The problem with Monero, as I understand it, is twofold:
1.  More Monero can be made/mined.  How much?  I'm not sure.  I recently read that it can be mined privately and or more "added" and no one knows for sure.  Not sure if this is true, but if it is, that's a serious problem.
2.  You don't need a zillion Monero.  You only need a few hundred thousand to make ALL of bitcoin anonymous.
So, you bought $10k in BTC from an exchange and they report same to your gov.  Send the BTC to a mixer -&gt; BTC -&gt; XMR -&gt; BTC -&gt; new anonymous wallet.
And so, the same 10,000 XMR could move millions of bitcoins to new anonymous wallets.
In the end, XMR could trade at .25 cents and still be as effective as it is now.

I met some Mormons in Minsk, Belarus back in the day.  They were collecting all of the "old" Ruble notes that were useless as a few zeros had been removed for the new notes (inflation).
I asked what they were doing with all these 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 ruble notes and they said that they were putting them in Monopoly sets for their nieces and nephews.  They had already enough Rubles for 4 or 5 board sets.  I thought it was brilliant.
I asked them to accompany me to the bank and act as interpreters.   I bought, stacks of the old Rubles, enough for two boards and took them home.  That must have been 15 years ago.  
While unpacking after a move, I found them and traded out my kid's monopoly $ for them.  Her friends love to play Monopoly at our house because we "use real money."
It is a lesson though: inflation leads to the devaluation of your money.  Enough of it and your money is as useless as the paper money of Milton Bradley.

Excellent, that really opens a window and makes it seem more clear now.
I've only recently started playing with Bitaddress.org to create an address and key and now I see that you don't "go to" the chain to create an address, you just create an address based on the set criteria, and then send the coins to the address you created.
I was having trouble grasping how this was possible; certainly sooner or later, you'll end up with someone else's address.  Watched a youtube video and the guy explained that the address possibilities are so numerous that the different configurations are equal to the number of atoms in the universe.
And so, with this electrum, I can just generate an address &amp; key?  All offline - very useful.

Retarded huh?
It never ceases to amaze me how many assholes there are in the bitcoin world.
Yes, I notified Google.  The ad came down and now it is back up.  I'm sure, I can notify them again, and the bot will take it down, and the hackers will put it up.  It will probably take a HUMAN to get it shut down.  Do I have that kind of pull?  No.  But maybe Bittrex does.
If someone had a fake ad in my company's name, I'd notify my customers, place a warning on my site, etc.  BUT AT LEAST I'D ANSWER THE DAMNED EMAIL.  Bittrex, it seems, answers when they feel like it.  Just gives you an idea of what to expect should you every have any issues in working with them.
For all I know, this phishing site has been up for weeks.  Maybe the OP even went there by accident.  It wouldn't be hard to open a browser, type in Bittrex and forget the .com and then get the Google search page and click on the top link.
And yes, Bittrex DOES control Google search results.  If you notify Google that someone is phishing using your company name, they will respond.
Who do I think that Bittrex is going to contact?  Here is an idea, take the intern, put him on 24/7 watch and have him send phishing report after phishing report to Google to keep that site down until a human is reached on the next business day.  That is what Branson would do for his company.  It is what the competent leadership of any company would do.

I just did exactly this last night.
All I did was download bread &amp; set up my wallet.
Then, I went to the receive money screen on bread
&amp; then on coinbase, i clicked the accounts tab and then the account that had my funds.  I clicked the send arrow
Up popped the place to enter the address.  I copied the "receive money" address from my bread and sent it via whatsapp to myself (another whatsapp account - but you could email it) and then copied and pasted the address to the coinbase page and hit send.
It asked for my 2FA (Google Auth) - I put it in and it was on its way.
A few seconds later, my bread notified me of an incoming transfer.  I watched both (bread on my phone and coinbase on my computer) as they ticked off 1 - 6 confirmations, about every 10 mins, and after about an hour, the transfer was complete.
In the future, if you want to buy more coin, you can buy it at coinbase or any other exchange, or anywhere else you can accumulate it) and then just send it to your wallet.  If you ever want to sell it at coinbase, just reverse the process and send it back to convert to dollars/euros, etc.
In this way, if coinbase is ever hacked (like Mt. Gox was) you won't lose your coin.

Your average Ameircan/Aus/Canadian/European who wants to buy this and that ($5 - $50 - $100) purchases doesn't want to pay $3-5 per transaction.  They're going to use ETH or BCH.
For a migrant to, say EU, who has family in, say in India, how do they send $50 a month back home?  They aren't going to pay a $5 BTC tax to send it that's for sure.

Basic investor herd mentality that most here don't really understand.
A price can fall lower than you ever believed possible, and can stay down longer than you can imagine.  
Inversely, prices can rise higher and higher than you can IMAGINE.  When my 80 year old grandfather rings me and says that the old men at the retirement home are talking about buying some bitcoin, then I'll know we've reached saturation.  We're NOT EVEN CLOSE YET.

The problem is that people vote based on what they see on facebook and The View.  Congress is completely corrupted.  It matters not if you vote R or D - they are two sides of the same corrupt coin.
Replace them all with fresh blood and then you are talking.

No one.
That is what makes (is supposed to make) the block chain perfect.  It relies on no one's trust.  Each person acts as a greedy SOB and this keeps the next greedy SOB in line.
decentralized selfishness and self-preservation

Put your seed(s), 2FA keys and all the rest of your "need to know" stuff on a file, + instructions on how to use it all, encrypt it, and put it on a USB drive.  Put some family photos and a word/text file with a goodbye letter on the USB.  Write "family photos and last letter" on the USB with a sharpie.
Put the USB in your safe deposit box.
Give the encryption key to your family members.  Don't put it in your will.
And now, you still have full access to your wallets and keys.  If, you make any big changes (new address/wallet/key/2FA), update the file on your USB but keep the same decryption key.
No one can access your wallets/keys except you.  Not even your family.
If you die, only with your death certificate can your family open your box.  With the encryption key, they can read the USB file and have instructions plus the keys.
If a probate or court officer gets into your box first, or accompanies your family member, the USB stick looks like a personal item and won't be seized/inventoried for the court for tax purposes.
Edit to add:  If you're not comfortable with a USB or CD - you can make encrypted paper seeds using this program:
Choose a password that is easy for your family to remember.  Here is an idea, your name, your dad's name, grandfather's name, mom's name, her father's name, etc.  You could use the first names of everyone in your family tree - something not easily found by anyone but your family.
I've been using the program all afternoon - works great (offline) - and its free!

This worked (under Roosevelt in the 30's) because they could go house to house and seize your gold.  You couldn't do anything with your gold because no one could take it - it was contraband.  All you could do was take it out of the country.  But, it is sorta hard to move such weight - especially when flying ;-)
The thing about BTC is that it can be sent, electronically, around the world in a flash.  It can be buried (key memorized or encrypted) and the gov.gov can't find or touch it.
If your scenario ever happened, any BTC holder could still use their coin anonymously on the web or else, take a drive to Canada/Mexico and spend it there.
