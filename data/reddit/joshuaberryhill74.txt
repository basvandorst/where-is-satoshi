Coinbase held my money they took out of my bank account 5 days prior to the fork, and only after the fork 12 hours later did my money show up. So maybe you don't realize what they pulled on their customers,  but a lot of us do!!!
5 days after they took b it out of bank account, really....coinbase screwed a lot if us. I never had to wait 5 days for credited bitcoin.
So it's not just those who left the money in their theory...it's more like why 5 days?? I'm one of many, many people they did this too.
I also guarantee they will say, the money was not turned into bitcoin until after the fork!!!
So we owe you nothing, even though we held your $$ for 5 days...Glad I have the debit ach to prove it.....
So for me, business is done with them. Many other wallets that don't sit on their customers.

Coinbase, should be funding wallets with not what customers had in the wallet at time if fork.
They should be funding the wallets with the market value they are costing their customers...
If at 1/1/18 Bitcoin cash is say $1,000 and it grew from rough figure $300, they should be funding the wallets with the gains price and not shorting them....
Their taking something good, and creating bad tastes in people's mouths...I personally did a transfer 10 days prior to the fork. 6 days prior they tapped my bank account for the amount, and 5 days later 12 hours after the fork, only then did they credit my account.....
Why did they hold people's money for days????
Either way, we all have our own opinion, but Coinbase is done on my end as to business with me...PLENTY OTHER WALLETTS!
