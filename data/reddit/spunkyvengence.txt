This is how you lose money. The market usually prices this stuff in long before it happens. And even if this were so the amount of coins that will be less on the market considering the amount that has already been mined is minuscule.
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:37:15
can't say i get the reference :)
@_date: 2019-06-10 14:40:42
Yep. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any setting for the maximum amount of fee one is willing to pay with BLW.
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:42:37
it's an excellent way to lose friends though!
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:50:24
@_date: 2019-06-12 07:56:29
pretty much this. Even if the halvening were to affect the price in the way people here think it does, it would only be a minimal increase.
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:01:31
why? so it looks more sustainable than it actually is? why not just pick an arbitrary curve so it looks like it's consistently and constantly going up?
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:15:19
will it be written in php? :D

this is why you don't keep money in bank deposits - that's what stock and bonds are for.
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:59:21
Absolute waste of time and money.

my guess, people think spamming positive price posts will increase FOMO. 
The other thread about a person complaining was removed because "it was whining without having any content" (like the other spam in this sub is any better), so I'm taking things into my own hands and they definitely can't remove this for not having any content.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:46:04
just calling people out on stupid shit.
@_date: 2019-06-07 20:01:26
Calculating an appropriate fee is a complex issue and naturally algorithms don't *always* work. Just because their algorithm is off here and there doesn't make them scammers. Ignore u/xboox
@_date: 2019-06-05 11:56:26
It's in no way reliable. There is no guarantee if you sell x btc that you can buy x btc back for the same amount of fiat - meaning it definitely is a gamble. If this were the case btc would be worth close to 0 a long time ago.
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:04:33
Unfortunately i don't think you can do that with any of the hardware wallets (yet), it's just not implemented at all.
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:22:35
If there's a log they should be able to. Do you know any of your addresses that are connected to the funds? If you do you can most likely backtrack from it on a blockexplorer and find said transaction. It's also pretty weird that it wouldn't show the transaction id, because *every* bitcoin wallet i ever used had that functionality.
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:42:47
~~How do you get around the checksum?~~
edit: i see, pretty cool. Unfortunately this only really is feasible for 12-word seeds, unless you want to manually test 256 combinations with the 24-word seed.

Quantum-resistant cryptography already exists, so if there's a need the development will shift into that direction. Also hashes used in btc are believed to be quantum-resistant as well so unless you're reusing addresses you're pretty much safe.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:10:23
don't know in which universe you live in, it has a ton of good content.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:50:48


Absolutely. Development can't keep up with the hype, and that is a problem.


Absolutely not true. The major innovation that's going on in this field is happening mostly on bitcoin. It also has by far the most careful dev team. The development is continuing on and things to come look pretty good. Obviously stuff can't happen overnight.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:01:54


It's his money, he can do whatever he wants. Giving bitcoin with the intent that the new owner will follow *your* ideas is retarded as hell.


Or it could not. I'm guessing OP already did his own analysis on what is worth more to him at the moment.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:44:53
It has also gone down very fast before. Regardless you're still very wrong with your statement.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:46:56


sure, sure... gotta pump it while you can, amirite.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:44:08
Those are rookie numbers, gotta pump those numbers up.
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:03:02
Why would that be so? Using dice would be a great way for generating a seed and not trusting the prng.
@_date: 2019-06-03 05:17:31
While I mostly agree that those kind of predictions are stupidly optimistic I think you give enough credit to how stupid "investors" really are - once they see they can make a quick buck their intelligence goes out of the window. I think with FOMO that bitcoin is causing there's a more than zero chance that it reaches that kind of heights, albeit for a very short time.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:53:08
rightly so, lol
@_date: 2019-06-03 05:47:26
It's not under their control so they can't do that.
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:29:00
I own 0. I'm really only here because it's interesting from a technical view.
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:17:30


Didn't say you did, just saying there's something more to this or you must be the unluckiest person alive.


Like I said it might be a bug in the wallet and the transaction is actually not a valid transaction, in which case it will never confirm. If you can find the transaction ID i'm pretty sure everyone here would be interested in what happened.
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:01:59
Me too :(
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:19:02
Can we please stop giving this guy more exposure?
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:11:23
This has to be the most retarded comment I've read in a long time, lol.
@_date: 2019-06-05 15:30:12


that isn't so, you don't have to. you can use any wallet that includes the payment protocol, but there's not many of them.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:11:45
Definitely. You should take a bank loan, 100%. You'll thank me when bitcoin is a million dollars.
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:47:37
No worries. If you manage to make it any better let me know! :)
@_date: 2019-06-13 22:10:22
You broadcast the transaction normally and hope the bitcoin network recognizes it as the valid transaction instead of attackers'.
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:12:31
Thank god for RES filters.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:48:29
A grade shitpost! Well done!
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:13:56
So much this. Even with RES filters this sub has become nothing else but a bunch of memes. Sometimes I have maybe 3 posts per page, because everything else is filtered out. It's ridiculous. 
There should definitely be a bitcoin sub where all price talk is censored, if it exists please let me know.
@_date: 2019-06-05 11:08:21
@_date: 2019-06-05 15:00:57
the bitcoin payment protocol has nothing to do with bcash and has in fact been proposed long before bcash even existed. I'm pretty sure they use it for bcash payments also.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:21:04
there is no 'loss'. It was obviously a conscious decision that felt the best at the time, whatever happens after doesn't matter a bit.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:36:15
Thank god for RES filters.
@_date: 2019-06-21 10:33:49
It's just flat out wrong. There's still almost 100% to the bitcoin top and there are **plenty** of people that bought during that time.

people are uninformed, that's why they are asking questions. What's wrong with you?
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:06:47
I find this incredibly weird because a bitcoin address contains a checksum, so it's pretty unlikely you'd type it wrong and it still be a valid address.
@_date: 2019-06-03 05:22:07
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:25:57


Please, enlighten me. Bitcoin has been the pinnacle of innovation in the crypto world since the beginning. Most of the ideas of other currencies were also discussed and developed on the bitcointalk forum.
Also he didn't even say he owns any crypto, maybe he's like me and is only interested in the technology.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:46:53


history doesn't predict the future, and a lot of people found out about that the hard way.
@_date: 2019-06-05 10:18:06
The worst thing about bitpay has to be them stupidly forcing the bitcoin payment protocol that most wallets don't implement.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:03:17
Don't know about fees on coinbase but if this is a bitcoin tx fee you can set it as low as you want, just know it won't be confirmed right away that way. If it's a coinbase fee then maybe look at some other exchanges and/or in person exchange.
@_date: 2019-06-12 14:53:34
I'll be more specific, the only problematic part is reusing addresses already sent from.
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:11:23
The chance of a mistyped address being valid are 1 in 4 billion. It didn't happen. My guess is the address you sent to is the correct one and it just didn't appear in the wallet (at that time) for some reason - or cash app has a bug and is not validating addresses correctly, in that case the transaction will never confirm so you're not out of funds.
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:41:26
holy shit do i hate people that do this.
@_date: 2019-06-05 09:19:17


If you do what you're suggesting you create a $1000 gap between the bid and the ask price right after the transaction. The first bitcoins you can buy will cost you $8500, not $7500, unless people actually drop their expected ask price, at which point you're just speculating this will happen. It's a gamble at best.
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:27:48


It's not even remotely the same because bitcoin isn't in the same category as euros. This is a terrible advice.
Sure you can do that and most likely get away with it but let's not pretend that it's legal.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:19:59
Good job on deciding when it's the best time for you to get out. Whatever happens remember this was the best decision for you at the time - I see a lot of people being super salty if it happens to be better to hold longer.
