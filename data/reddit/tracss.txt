Hi what do you mean with the last bullet? Only the total value itself is taxed? Do you have to pay taxes again when you sell (on top of the yearly taxes)?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:05:51
But it also brings new functionality so could transactions potentially not go up and we could get less fees?
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:42:49
Great, can we get consensus on this? Oh wait..

Well In my country I have to pay a yearly amount on my profit. It's doable to track all these forks but I don't see them as a profit really because of the trading hassle..

Why not bip38 paper wallet?
@_date: 2015-12-02 07:42:36
How is this safer than bip38 paper wallet? ( or isnt it?)
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:49:15
I'm not debating about complex issues.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:08:05
I'm not a bitcoin expert but if miners can place transactions on both blockchains, let's say the settlement blockchain and the coffee blockchain. Would the settlement blockchain get bloated with coffee transactions?
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:28:17

Ah that's what I meant..
@_date: 2015-06-21 13:18:39
In that order?
@_date: 2015-12-13 10:39:10
But if you find the seed you have the money.if you find a bip38 wallet you have nothing. Imo multiple bip38 wallets is safer.

Old news!
@_date: 2014-05-10 10:20:48
And by the way, I don't think its fair to say that the merchant must not accept 0 confirmations to avoid this. You must always expect a transaction to go through if it's a valid transaction.It's unacceptable that small valid transactions without a fee won't be included in a block  Just make it mandatory  then..
@_date: 2014-06-03 10:50:52
There's no turning back. Too many advantages. Did the recipients felt that way also? Great initiative!
@_date: 2014-09-17 10:47:58
Maybe add some more big brands which implemented btc like global payments inc, expedia, wordpress etc.
@_date: 2014-08-26 10:34:40
This. Matter of time before discogs accepts bitcoin. In ny store on discogs I have bitcoin already mentioned in my payment options. Discount 20%. If anyone is intrested visit

Not really but there are lots of sites that use Twitter bootstrap.

Couple of months ago someone posted a picture of a circle diagram of apple pay vs bitcoin. Cant find it anymore . Anyone has the link? 
@_date: 2014-10-11 11:13:25
Ehm...no I am def not the guy
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:00:25
That's also a pretty big statement you make here. Do you still have incentives to work on the protocol then? From my point of view making such a decision looks like your trust on the long term is totally gone. Or is it just only a rational decision based on what you agreed yourself on in the past?
@_date: 2014-12-20 20:35:55
Yes I noticed the same a couple of hours ago. I only saw my id field and password field. I immediatly checked the url but it was correct. I closed the browser and
 entered the url manually again. Then it said I had another browser ( eeehm no..) and they automatically emailed me a security code. After I clicked on the confirmatkon link in my gmail I could enter my 2fa  again.  I went through this with extreme caution but please be careful too. There are some scam sites out there
@_date: 2014-08-04 10:51:04
When is bitcoin considered not an experiment anymore? It could implode any moment according to Gavin.
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:26:21
Is it really that much money? I think they're sticking their toes in the water. 21 mln from 40 investors. Imo thats peanuts for them. Maybe they have btc in private. You dont know.
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:49:25
Did you already talk with cex.io what their proposal for decentralizing bitcoin mining will be?
@_date: 2014-07-29 11:46:13
What, who and where?
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:17:29
I think blockchain.info has this. Look for the json or csv export on the chart page. With a little php you can build a web app with it.
@_date: 2014-11-21 11:17:11
Hate? Relax, its only $50. Just buy it back.
@_date: 2014-12-28 13:43:52
That's a pity because here in the netherlands it couldnt be easier. As a new user you can get bitcoin in 5 min. For example via bitonic.nl

I'm a noob concerning the core protocol but I can imagine the protocol isn't going to change that much in the future as it is now.
As I see many bright minds working on the rest of the infrastructure / bitcoin 2.0, isn't it more wise to 'finish' the basis first?

If it cannot be regulated like coinbase or circle wouldnt it be easy for the government to just put blockchain.info offline?

@_date: 2014-02-14 13:04:04
That's nice but if I use a webhost can't they block .bit sites when there's government regulation? I could use my own webserver ofcourse..
from the wiki:
Most shared hosts (like Dreamhost, Hostgator, Bluehost, etc) and control panels (like CPanel) have error checking mechanisms that prevent non-traditional TLD's from being added. The best you can do is try to add your .bit domain using the normal domain configuration interface they provide and contact their technical support if this fails.

If you want to buy muchos bitcoin to hold I personally would put it on bip38 encrypted paper wallets. Really easy to do with bitaddress.org.
If you want to store just a small amount I would put it on blockchain.info.

I agree, It's not easy to be in the front line
@_date: 2014-01-18 09:13:02
I think I asked that question on the coinsiderthis talk.
Don't you think there is need for an "official" centralized forum where programmers and non-programmers kan meet and discuss these kind of things? The best suggestions/solutions could also come from non-programmers. Maybe attach a sort of voting system so if there's a certain demand programmers could code it and hand it over to the core devs. It prevents sending code to the core devs when there's no need for it.
The same for layers on top of bitcoin.
I asked a question here regarding the possibilities of the blockchain. ( While I respect the one answer, I was hoping for a more in depth conversation. A centralized discussion in a place with experts on why it's (not) possible would be more constructive. Maybe the forum could be centralized at the bitcoin foundation site. I think a lot of people (also the people involved in bitcoin) still don't get all the possibilities (including me).
Hope to hear your opinion.
Keep up the good work! Big fan here!!

I thought this as well but who cares actually? Only the libertarians?
@_date: 2014-01-13 13:47:58
 Bitcoin != anonimity. I hope it's going towards more anonimity instead of less.
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:19:26
This is not my point. The transaction becomes INVALID because it's not picked  up by miners because of the zero fee. This is unacceptable.
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:26:19
I think there are two scenarios that could lead the value to zero which I cannot control.
- Protocol flaw / hack
- Volatility
I'm sure the volatility will decline when it gets more adopted so that's not my main concern. My main concern is, can billions of people trust the developers for the first point? As there is no backup...
@_date: 2014-10-23 05:53:55
I see btc like a token. Its properties can be whatever it wants in the future. Btc is also being used today as a currency, only not that much. When there are more use cases of btc the value will stabilize is my belief.
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:23:44
Until your drive gets corrupt.. lol. Feel better now? Maybe you could make a paper wallet as well

What are the architectural flaws of bitcoin vs ripple protocol ( not ripple labs)? I've heard that ripple nodes arent censorship resistant for example. Looking for these kinds of examples.
@_date: 2014-05-20 08:34:51
So why did they take it down?
@_date: 2014-10-23 06:16:45
Arent bitcoin miners the same as sidechain miners? I thought these sidechains where merge-mined? Sorry for the probably noob questions but this bothers me a bit. As blockstream is just a company with financial motives, the censorship resistance properties of bitcoin for example is in danger I believe. They now have a company they could attack. Or am i wrong?
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:38:40

Yes, the transaction is visible on the mycelium app(recipient). However the amount  is not added and it still says busy receiving.
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:21:23
Indeed. And that surprises me. I cannot imagin they don't have advisors that can inform them about these things. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:41:59
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:54:28
So you turned on the log scale right?
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:48:16
I believe remittances are a big market for bitcoin. How does bitcoin solve the volatility? Does the Ripple network has this volatility issue also?
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:17:14

Lol! Give this man some gold
@_date: 2014-12-22 13:34:12
Its the year 2030. I still have some bitcoin from the early days in cold storage. Can I ask more than the market price for these coins as there is less transaction history on this address? Could there be a demand for this?
@_date: 2014-03-21 13:30:27
Awesome job!! Thanks from the Netherlands!!
@_date: 2014-07-26 09:58:56
Nice try but you miss too many foreign companies. For example netherlands:

@_date: 2014-05-13 19:47:55

@_date: 2014-01-14 14:34:29
Can you explain this or can you give a link with more info? 
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:03:28
Could you elaborate on that?
@_date: 2014-03-21 14:35:13
So it isnt possible to intercept data like passwords etc.? Whats this about then? Also  watch the video.
 
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:00:23
I see some possibilities for charities. Do you have to pay after 200 days? I thought that was what I read in the namecoin docs.
@_date: 2014-10-10 12:10:08
Discounts &amp; free stuff. Nice concept.
@_date: 2014-01-01 19:51:31
It's  certainly not the fastest way to get bitcoins if you live in the Netherlands.
- Go to  (or 
- Enter amount of BTC and BTC address
- Pay with Bank card
- Wait a couple of minutes... and it's there!
@_date: 2014-06-30 11:13:34
Yeah same here. It was 150 euro when I thought I should read more about it. Bought at 420 euro a few weeks later
@_date: 2014-08-26 17:04:31
oh its on the record description on the main page i think.
@_date: 2014-11-11 20:00:02
Yes, the video is actually much more interesting than the article.
They talk a lot about bitcoin and the banking system.
@_date: 2014-06-23 11:07:28

Mmm yes, the ' innovation without permission' thing is also not possible with centralisation. My 2cts
@_date: 2014-02-03 10:11:48
Yeah just read it.. 20% is guessing and 80% don't know what it is..so anyone else here who can explain it?
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:53:47
Aaaaand it's back
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:20:16
Maybe for the U.S. with their creditcard culture it's a normal thing. But I cannot agree with this at all. Security should always be present.
@_date: 2014-05-10 10:29:00
Sorry don't agree. If a transaction could fail if you don't add a fee , who's going to use no fees then? I can only think of frauds who want to deliberately want to cause harm. Just make it mandatory for everyone to avoid these things to happen. Nobody wants unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:12:08
Sigh...getting tired of China. In 2 months they're back in again.

@_date: 2014-06-02 13:05:10
I asked this question again but i'm still confused. I had a transaction not made confirmed by miners
 ( transaction had a too low fee. 0.0001). The wallet which I send to had these transactions already added. Eventually they got deducted again from the balance. The recipient was the same as the sender but what if I did this with a merchant on the street? They never would get
 their money but I would get their
 product. Why not make the fee
 mandatory in the core to
 prevent this from happening?
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:08:12
Is it placed in a living room or what? lol.
@_date: 2014-03-17 08:30:43
Me too. But getting people to listen to it is another story haha.
@_date: 2014-05-10 08:58:57
Still don't get it. Why not make fees mandatory? Avoids double spends
@_date: 2014-08-04 12:16:48

Thanks!! My first tip! :-)
@_date: 2014-05-10 12:15:40
Instead of laughing you could help explain it. Do you think this is how sending a transaction should work? It should be a flawless experience. Maybe you're more technical than me but try to see it from a user perspective. This is confusing as hell.
@_date: 2014-08-04 11:38:27

What about trust in bitcoin devs? They could screw up anytime. I never hear anyone mention this. Is this irrelevant? 
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:10:15
..as the first energy company in the world btw..
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:46:43
Okay, but this is not a solution to this problem. The problem is that zero fee transaction can cause stuck transactions. If you do a transaction, the last thing I want to do is to tell the sender every time to not forget to add a miner fee. This isn't user friendly and it can cause harm to the recipient. My opinion is to implement a minimal fee and turn off the ability to use zero fees.
Why do we actually want this centralisation of miners that individually can set the miner fee? Why isn't this value a constant in the core protocol that could be changed once in a while by the core devs?
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:38:20
And Greenspan calls it a bubble again....Haha..
@_date: 2014-05-10 12:08:24
Huh? I just got an email from blockchain.info that this payment is send again to my mycelium wallet?? That doesn't match their answer in their previous (transaction failed) email that the transaction is aborted and I can spend these coins again. They just automatically send it again! This smells like a creditcard pull .
[edit] Scary b.t.w. when you get an e-mail that a payment is send when you didn't do anything.
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:15:40
How do big payment processors like the dutch Mollie sell their bitcoins on the market? Do they tage a big risk in accepting btc if the demand is not high enough?

Crazy when you think about it. A multi billion dollar project and a core developer is worried about paying his rent. All I can say is good decision and I hope you or your team find a good solution...P.s. I thought there were some funding rounds started to get more big miners in. Didn't barry silbert just funded one? Do you know anything about that and do you think this will be a good solution eventually..
@_date: 2014-05-05 09:58:05
I think Bitcoin can be really anonymous eventually. Why is the US more or less still pro-bitcoin with all its kyc , aml , wars on drugs etc..?
For example  merchants still are able to accept it and they really can ban this quite easily to prevent more adoption in some way. You think this is going to change when the btc market cap is large enough? I know they can't completely ban it but it can get more nasty than it is right now. I'm from the Netherlands but it feels like every country in Europe is watching the US what they're going to do. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 12:30:50
And do you think that's normal? Why isn't a standard fee already implemented if a zero fee can cause these problems?
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:36:55
Andreas as stand-up comedian lol!
A more interesting question would be if they made it illegal to contain or deal in bitcoin for merchants and consumers. What then...
@_date: 2014-05-11 10:21:03
@_date: 2014-05-10 10:16:34
I'm also pretty new but my understanding is that it already was propagated into the network, just not confirmed yet. It was deducted from my account on blockchain.info and added to my mycelium wallet. You can see the transaction in Mycelium but when I click the Hash(url to blockchain.info) in the transaction details the transaction could not be found on blockchain.info... So what's happening here..
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:20:22
It's kind of a workaround but you could use this :

I enter my PIN in 3 sec.  You better block that card immediately if you lose it. That's a real risk for the customer.
Can double spends with bitcoin happen that easily?
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:24:45
Just saw this link: 
How does this relate to a 51% attack? If some miners have 51% of hashpower, is that still insufficient because the transaction wont validate through these 55000 nodes? Also if these are non-listening nodes?   
[Edit] paging would be wise I guess..

Right. So you always get your money back
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:44:15
TIL: Nicolas Courtois  == Mike Hearn
"Another threat that has recently emerged is that of a system being hijacked because a different software implementation creates a ‘split’ within an existing system. Cryptanalysis researcher Nicolas Courtois at UCL, who has followed Bitcoin closely, reported in August 2015 that:
“There will be a possibility to mine blocks with a new version number and new rules. This is meant to make bitcoin more democratic: larger blocks, more transactions per second, lower fees, wider adoption. Current bitcoin has reached its capacity limits (not much more than 3 transactions per second) in the recent months and bitcoin developer community has FAILED to solve this problem.”

No, this is just plain stupid. My kids can install wordpress themes and it looks 100x better than this
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:32:35
Also...You have to add the sum of the bitcoin forks. So bitcoin(core) + bitcoin cash + bitcoin gold = OG bitcoin. more than 9000 dollars.

Html &amp; Media queries != code???  I give up...
@_date: 2015-08-27 20:39:56
You clearly don't understand the point I'm trying to make. All I'm saying is it takes only a good wordpress theme and some tweaking  to make this site looks better than this. They should have done that instead of doing it themselves if they don't know how to code. Webdesign != webdevelopment. I don't think you know the difference seeing your answer.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:30:04

@_date: 2015-04-14 17:49:01
At this time it's just a protocol without proper infrastructure. For lots of people there is no incentive to use bitcoin right now. If bitcoin was a company the system wouldn't be in production for sure. Dont forget bitcoin is still in beta! So traders trade and play with it and it affects the price. In order for consumers to use it merchants have to offer discount. People dont care about the  decentralized aspect. They just want discount, no hassle and a stable currency. And bitcoin is just not that at the moment. 
So give it some time! Bitcoin will find its way. The cleverest people in the world are working on it. And don't forget about the network effect and the stickyness of money. Everybody invested in it wants it to succeed because it could drive the price up. This greed factor is imo one of the fundamentals of the bitcoin protocol.
I think it eventually will succeed and I dont get too upset by the price. I have invested in it but not that much that would cause me to panic. I think in 10/ 15 years you should take another look at the price.

@_date: 2015-04-08 20:02:06
As I understood it, miners are a subset of nodes. Nodes put the txs in a block. So why can't my majority of  nodes prevent txs to be included in a block? 
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:19:39
So in theory  the NSA could buy 50.000 nodes for 1 million dollar and spread these accross the globe to get a fair control over the network? They also could add new code to bitcoind for tracking people/ surveillance for example?

According to the site: People compare Bitcoin to the Internet. Well, the Internet required an enormous hardware infrastructure buildout before its potential as a software platform could be realized. That's where we come in. We believe that Bitcoin isn't going to happen simply by dropping a line of Javascript into a webpage. Someone needs to build the full-stack infrastructure for Bitcoin, from silicon to software. Backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel, that someone is us.

@_date: 2013-12-30 10:21:39
But this is like if a plane loses a screw it will crash. Bitcoin has to be implemented so that it has no single point of failure. 
Isn't it possible to backup the blockchain, rollout a new updated protocol/currency and upload the backupped blockchain?
Just a thought..
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:46:46
Does it have to die? Can't they fix the Bitcoin protocol and restore the blockchain from a few seconds before it was hacked? (Or is this what you mean..?)
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:10:43
That's nice, but what will happen to my money then?
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:53:42
