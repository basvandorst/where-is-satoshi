Did you also post to ethereum sub about those ethereum cookies that are cut out?

My guess would be that he won't be that stupid to dump those all at once, but as this reaches frontpage people will start to panicsell and effect will be the same. We will find out soon. Hodl on tight boys! We are going for a ride

I can only see one outcome from any hard fork. Both chains will be dumped HARD. I wouldn't be surprised to see BTC + BCH combined to fall to around 1300$
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:50:33
shhhh, don't let people know. They will start to sell and it will get down to 1000 again and we have to wait 2 more months for it to get back x)

I don't really understand how this bitcoin works, even though I've been hodling for about year and half now and trying to soak all information I can find in this subreddit. Anyway wouldn't splitting chain in these circumstances mean that BTC price would drop -50% or way more as suddently there is double amount of "bitcoins" around and one side refuses to use the other chain and vice versa? Wouldn't rbtc guys just hardfork the legacy chain if you guys got the UASF going through? For me it seems that in near future there will be atleast 3 "bitcoin" blockchains. And all those altcoins would be worth just fraction of what btc is now?  
Please explain like I was 5.

Isn't 10$ out of 4200 just dirt cheap? I understand people crying about their 10$ micro transactions paying &gt;10% fees, but this should be totally fine. It is only 0.238%

Not in a million years will I give one single satoshi to any african country. Best help for them (and specially us) is to stop all the charity and sink every "ship" that tries to cross to europe with illegal immigrants.

Hopefully. I just wish that this gets sorted out in next hour and that I wouldn't need to wait for their working hours tomorrow.

I don't get it why are people always bringing up mortgage in their calculations? Why would you loan money if you have millions in bank account? Just pay that house straight away and live. Or arent americans allowed to own properties?

I got dem back :3 
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:57:22
Or are we in that "back to normal" part from bubble chart? Whatever is happening next: no sell, only hodl.
