Thank you! I appreciate the genuine reply.  That helped me put into perspective what purpose a future serves and how it could be beneficial/harmful for either party involved.

Then ignore it and move on. I'll check out investopedia, but having a conversation about futures and how they will impact bitcoin is 100% relevant.

Yes it's very dead, I'll take your BTC off of your hands for you!!

Fair enough!

How much do I invest monthly if I don't have a huge income? (35k a year, take home 1k bi weekly) 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:14:10
I could, but having a dialogue about it is more valuable to me. 
No need to be snarky.

That's extremely interesting, I did not know that! 
Thank you for sharing

I'm brand new to bitcoin..I was told it was the easiest and most user friendly. I was wrong..

Well you're wrong, it's 100% possible....I have verification of a 1k purchase from bitcoin and it reflects on my bank statement...then I have a random, unwarranted $1,000 from coinbase on my bank statement on a separate date with no explanation.

Bitcoin just hit it's all-time high...I want to invest, is this literally the worst time to do so? Should I wait/hope for it to 'crash' slightly before investing?
