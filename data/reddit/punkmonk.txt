ACLU  please. They are our last defense in this increasingly political world.

I was quite disappointed with this episode. Normally these guys go quite in depth, but I found this discussion quite shallow.
Comparing it just to some past online currencies, none of which were decentralized is just not fair. 
Here are some of my objections:
One can use cash for illegal transactions, just as much as Bitcoins. Saying some people use it for illegal things, and hence its Bad, is plain silly. Bitcoin transaction cannot be undone. So sending someone bitcoins online is same as sending someone cash by a courier. Tracking down illegal drug purchases can be done as easily. You simply monitor the person shipping the drugs. 
The recent setbacks faced by Bitcoins were not due to any weakness of Bitcoin itself. It was a local occurrence on one exchange. 
They did not explain anything about what is a bitcoin, and how one validates a transaction. 
Whats wrong with dollars? Well US just printed a shit ton of money, and all of a sudden i am a lot poorer because my dollars are worth less now. If USD was still on the gold standard, then that would have been a different thing. 
mention other advantages? I can actually make a wallet on a USB key, and save it under my mattress. i.e., take it off the network; something you can't do with other online currencies. At the same time I can send it over the internet, somethign you can't do with cash.
There are no transaction fees. The entire idea of having banks as the middle men sucking money is gone.
