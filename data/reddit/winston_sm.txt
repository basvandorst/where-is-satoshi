Do you think the blondie that tried to get back to BC 'anonymity' even has the slightest idea what it is? Her facial expression convinces me, she doesn't.

This IS crooked indeed. All these lies, trying to buy time, ignoring you, being on holiday. Awful communications, dishonesty, everyone should not touch this company even remotely with a stick! 
Good luck to you, guys!

Lovely. That's nice of you

Always has been, indeed.

Business Class. First Class on European airlines is not the same as first class on American airlines.

Very right, indeed. Their planes are shabby. I resorted back to flying most of my Europe-HKG legs with Turkish Airlines. Surely not the best business product out there, but the price is unbeatable and I love the dining on board, if you overlook this terribly crowded lounge in Istanbul. 
Club Europe indeed is a joke, so was their lounge in Amsterdam a few years back. Just a shack. They improved that now, luckily. 
If BA wants to stay competitive in the premium segment they really need to get rid of that fishbone seating idea. The privacy issues are nasty, so is climbing over someone, if you want more privacy on a window seat, instead of an aisle seat. 
Once I booked a flight from AMS to HKG in a haste. Turned out, my connection would have been AMS-LGW-LHR-HKG with a 2.5 hr layover... Took three calls to have it rebooked with an hour-long layover in LHR. Full fare business class. That was a bummer and the last time I chose them.

Price, service, space, food. European and especially Eastern and Asian airlines have an entirely different world of service what you'd ever find in the US. Google Ethiad The Residence

Thank's, I'll check that, hope it's not only on funny dates.

I do agree. BA very much lacks with their Business and First products. I've only flown BA first once, plenty Business. I especially am disappointed about their food, which is always a high-standard pub-grab style. Compare that to TK, for example...
It says a lot when one seat in business class is better than any in first, on a 747 that is. 64K, bulkhead, no neighbour, flying forwards. 
Never had a complaint about their service though. They know your name and drink preferences from earlier flights, which is a nice touch.

Oh, yes, indeed. I believe I misread that, we are talking about the same.

First row. Costs only a couple of quid. In winter you freeze your ass off since there's no divider, during takeoff you might tangle your legs with those of the flight attendant, but otherwise enormous legspace!

European airlines don't offer a first class on short or medium-haul flights, on short-haul flights not even a real business class anymore, only a blocked middle seat, better service, a proper meal and lounge access. 
On long-haul flights, BA e.g. is really not very different from business class in terms of seating, other European/Asian airlines, however, differentiate their premium products drastically from their business ones.

I'm going to look up what a cyber school is and which educational systems use them to educate their future generations. But to me it seems, with an uneducated guess that it's time to switch to an actual and real school
