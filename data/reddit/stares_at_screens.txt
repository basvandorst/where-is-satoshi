Please don't do that.

You guys understand that controlled inflation is a good thing, right? This is economics 101.

What does this have to do with Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:48:08
Can you name one first innovator that has turned into a huge success in the technology sector?
Bitcoin is the first, but it's one of many. It's a bigger risk than what you're describing.
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:38:55
You mean you're confident in your ability to calculate the risk? Or that you think the risk is quite high?
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:57:37
As far as I can tell, bitcoin's main advantage is reputation (being first) and more services (being first). That advantage seems fairly tenuous in the IT world.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:16:11
I agree it might work. But might is an awfully broad word for someone who cannot afford to speculate and gamble.
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:55:36
You're joking, right?
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:35:53
I agree that is Bitcoin's greatest strength: A lot of smart people have a monetary stake in its success. On the other hand, there are a ton of ignorant people who also seem to be treating Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick tool. 
I think it's fascinating to watch.

Your comparison is incorrect.
Bitcoin is to the cryptocurrencies what Alta Vista (or some other early company or bulletin board) was to the internet.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:25:04
Don't the alternative coins also have blockchains based off of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:21:02


They don't have a choice.

As a credit card holder, you typically have some kind of fraud protection? 
I have never heard of a credit card company taking money from a vender on the basis that the credit card company was defrauded. (But I'm not knowledgeable about how this works.)
I think they may be blowing smoke at you. Talk to a consumer protection attorney.
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:29:43
Because apparently half of bitcoin investors think it's going to make them "free". 
Little do they know, it is just another vehicle for financial institutions to speculate on and re-package so that they can charge customers fees.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:36:30
So the vender bears the risk of the credit card company being defrauded?

What banks do and what is legal is often two very different things.
My understanding is that if a bank accepts a fraudulent check and pays you the funds after the "hold" period, for example, they are on the hook. But that's a commercial paper transaction and there's a lot of law in place for that. I'm not sure what the law is once you start dealing in electronic transactions. If there's no law in place, that may be very bad for a bank that starts taking money of out of someone's accounts just because it "can".
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:35:05
Well, that makes even less sense to me.
If a bank approves a transfer from one of its accounts to another of its accounts, I don't see how the bank gets off the hook if one of the account holder commits fraud. And I certainly don't see how the bank can go after the recipient for accepting money from the bank's own system.

Reading the second, "Bitcoin is evil", he makes good points. The headline is click-bait. But rest of the article is mostly pointing out that there is an unanswered question concerning what will keep Bitcoin's price stable. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:24:40
Why don't you see litecoin, dogecoin, etc. as competitors? Why couldn't a superior cryptocurrency appear at any time?
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:37:21
Your answers lack content.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:15:39
Help me understand this. You are talking about selling items directly from your own website, correct?
When someone uses Bitpay, what fee do you pay?
When someone uses another system (e.g. PayPal) what fee do you pay? (and what systems do you use?)
I haven't heard of this benefit before.

You people should not be investing in Bitcoins if you do not even understand how basic credit cards work.
Credit card companies protect their customers from fraudulent transactions (i.e. they will return money to you if you tell them a transaction was not done by you). And they can cancel credit card numbers.
This is really, really basic. Bitcoin is NOT basic at all. It can be a useful tool, but it is partly a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:58:02
You should post to and ask for help getting out of your credit card debt and dealing with your finances. 
Bitcoin is a huge risk, and you're not in a position to be taking risks.
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:47:48
Okay, then explain to me where its value comes from. What prevents bitcoin from going to $10 next month? What prevents it from going to $2000 next month?
As far as I can tell, its valuation is completely independent from its usefulness as a transactionary tool.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:12:36
Thanks for explaining it! 
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:21:18
Your answer is just as vague as saying "magic."
If you're going to speculate or invest in something, you had better have some idea where it's value is coming from.
As an investment, Bitcoin meets all the characteristics of a Ponzi scheme. It is reliant on new people putting their money into it to increase the value and pay the older investors when they cash out.
