Already bounced! sold and bought the dip. I should write a book about this stuff.

Ios is lacking in bitcoin alerts apps. But yes bitcoin ticker is a good one. Mobile app. More updated on Android though.

You can if you have a bank account linked in Korea or whatever. Thats too much hassle to deal with internationally. by the time it back to your us based account Im sure btc wouldve caught up, or crashed haha.

Just for some reassurance. I sent bitcoin from Coinbase to Blockchain on the 1st. I can't remember but I'm pretty sure Blockchain displayed the right amount now I see a balance from about a month ago. When its back up, Will I see the full amount?
Eit: on coinbase, it shoes the withdrawal to the wallet, but on blockchain it doesn't show the deposit to the wallet.

I read Mexican rant. Was confused till I noticed it was about cryptocurrency haha.
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:02:52
This... Sounds like an excellent business plan. Don't be mad if you see someone pop up with it in the next few months-years.
Legit though its a good idea. Some shows though, would need to be more i feel like. LIke maybe Game of thrones .50 cents each, with a limited amount of rewatching. Then you also allow monthly subscription at about $10 or something. Hell Netflix can just do this.

Lol wut?

You'd be very surprised how many immigrant are in the U.S.

Hey guy, Lets be friends.
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:15:34
Well I feel good about myself! I was sitting on mine till the Xbox One bitcoin deal at NewEgg. Got that shit so fast.
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:56:06
������ such sass. But rightfully warranted.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:42:45
Except people are confident and fearful at the same time.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:55:47
I'm honestly thinking of putting a bit out of bitcoin and into ethereum. Look at the massive jump it'd had this week. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:48:02
Coinbase also does eth.
@_date: 2016-06-03 23:03:38
I hadn't bought form coinbase in a while. Is this why its still 3 days till i get my bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:07:24
So this biggest. Well shit.
@_date: 2016-06-20 15:50:50
Even better with a chipped credit card. Just put it in, 3 seconds and transaction is finished. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 09:17:56
Circle. Setting it up is pretty easy too. I did credit card though. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:02:34
I have 1 :|
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:02:50
Got it. Buying Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:29:30
Lmao exactly how I feel. My sell point was $1000. I woke up at $940. I was like well shit. I might as well stay see how things go haha. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:32:35
Calm down, Jesus. You seem to be in constant rage lmao.
@_date: 2016-09-13 14:33:25
Usually what's app is popular because there's no messaging fee. Opposed to iMessage when there's a possibility of messaging fees for traditional non iMessage receivers. While what's app works on all. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:22:24
You act like everyone that buys bitcoin knows about gdax. Everyone knows about coinbase and see it as easy. Like people will instantly know what a limit order is. You're not thinking like a new comer. This isn't for the educated bitcoin trader. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:44:13
lol damn. shut people up real quick.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:51:37
which was nice for people selling at 19k.
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:52:33
For sure! we can share accounts but i cant tell you my username and password!
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:00:51
I'll need your login to assure it is safe. I'll even move it to a safer Coinbase account. 
Most people say keep it in a physical wallet and not to trust online wallets. I.e. Mt.gox debacle. I on the other hand feel Coinbase is safe.
 You could seperate your coins into different online wallets. GreenAdress for one has a good ios app.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 03:42:28
Take it from someone who invested in eth it's worth it. Just Hodl as usual and don't panic sell. Nothing but profits so far. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:31:27
It dipped below 2000 3 days ago on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:23:19
Hahaha. The shade in this is real.
@_date: 2015-11-09 21:19:02
Fuckkk i have some bitcoin and don't want to cash it in. Thanks for the reminder!!! i need to remember this for all games I can get for PC.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:12:17
Ohhh okay. I thought you meant somehow modifying the end results.   I'm sure they'll be black listed by the community. I don't really know how cheaters are in LoL. I never played it.
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:24:01
Ohhh god this is awesome. Imagine if it was put on console games, let's say super smash brothers. That would get me practicing haha.
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:39:30
What exactly would this do to the price of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:23:02
When you mean cheaters, do you mean in game cheaters? I'm just wondering. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:28:16
I wonder what percentage of the sales are of BTC to USD to ETH. ETH is literally skyrocketing past 400.  
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:37:50
Already posted
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:02:07
What about satoshi?
