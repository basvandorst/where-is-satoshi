Nothing changes as long as employers need to open their books. I could also pay/bribe some person in cash after all.

Tax is not payed because you get your loan in fiat money, but because your employer/corporation sends info about your payroll to the feds.. Most of the worlds money is never printed anyway. This does not depend on currency, but complacency.

See, government is meant to govern stuff..it needs some control..

And is still mining.. 1mb blocks as recently as april. How is it, we don't know who he is?
@_date: 2017-04-05 16:55:32
Basically what Im going at..and yes it is all there, just no name attached..
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:58:50
Well, at least the same relay node is mining. Was it transferred..is that possible..or?
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:15:49
No. I have absolutely no idea. There are active "mining"-tx, though.
E: As in, he is mining fresh blocks to the chain, from the same adress. Just click it..

you could have also not read my post.
He makes the point, yes. and I disagree. It is not the money that is tracked, but the companies that spend and collect it. It´s their lawful duty to report and accept audits.

I thought the Miners got their main rewards from fees on transactions?
Either way, the value of 12,5btc constantly changing, I hoped someone could give an estimated number in Dollars (answering the question how much the industry would be worth right now)
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:49:24
sure, but block rewards are decreasing every 210k blocks or so, called "the halvening". I guess that´s where OP is going with his question.
