I’ve had in my IRA since early 2017,  I think the premium will always be there because most mainstream investors won’t ever go through the hassle of using exchanges.  I plan to hold for a while and have always bought more when it dumps to a low.

You only pay early withdrawal fee if you withdraw from the ira...you can sell/buy other stocks all you want as long as you don’t withdraw you avoid the fee..

Just don’t panic sell when it dumps! It usually bounces right back up.  Just last week it hit 1300 one day, then climbed right back up to 2k range.

Wow ya screw that. I’d hire a good CPA at that point. That’s my plan for 2018

Ya exactly. No way I’m paying on that number, I tracked everything in Delta, just not sure where I report the transactions yet.

I tried this last night. You have to enter every transaction manually under “everything else” under “stocks, bonds, mutual funds...”. It asks you the date acquired,  date sold, proceeds, cost basis etc.. took a long ass time.  I exported the pdf from bitcoin tax as a guide for typing each transaction.

I got the same thing. I’ve never cashed out but they just sent me a pretty large number on the 1099k.  It must be from moving coins in/out for alt coins etc... I’m hoping there is a form to report individual transactions so that less taxes will be owed because right now I’m not even showing a profit.  Awful tax system we have here!
