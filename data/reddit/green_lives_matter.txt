I'm fairly new to all of this, but given that the block chain is anonymous anyway, how can they possibly prove that you control any of X number of addresses where your coins were sent? You could send them to a number of wallets you control and say you spent it on crack on the internet. Who would know the difference?

This guy had better go into hiding for the rest of his life, cause there are a LOT of people who would like to extract some of that value out of him with a hammer to the balls.

Dude just chip away at it. I toss around 3-500 a month depending on how much extra I have after my bills are paid. I treat it like a savings account.

Well, fuck me.... If anyone needs me I'll be over at and avoiding marriage forever.

The only real solution is to simply not ever fucking tell anyone about it. How would someone prove to a judge in the first place you have bitcoin if you hide your shit?
And even if your spouse knows you have bitcoin, how do they prove it to the court? You say they'd watch your address, but if nobody knows what your address is, then whats the danger?

Someone did.

Then you're doing it right :)

Most of reddit is that way now

No Sir, I don't like it.

Well you've apparently not been paying very good attention, or you stick to fringe subs.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:50:00
I see what you mean

You don't necessarily have to murder when you could just break a few knee caps.

I think from my time lurking here, the answer is: shut up and HODL

Isn't currency just a store of value? The paper in your wallet is just a symbol of value that you can trade for something material. You can pile it up or spend it.
I don't see a difference with bitcoin other than it being slightly less convenient to spend it.

I meant how is it under attack, but positivity is good too!

If you really think it's better there, I have a bridge to sell you for some bitcoin.

I don't think there is anywhere anymore. About the only thing left is to move to some obscure Asian country and become a tea farmer.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:01:26
how so?
