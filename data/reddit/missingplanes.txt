That's the one! He's a funny guy. I'd think he was a tech comedian, except he really implemented his own sshd in php and deployed it on his production servers. And bragged about it.

unfortunately, it's true. I'm getting a 404 now but he had a hysterical blog post at

Nice try, Mark. sshd is more than a simple wrapper around a php OpenSSL library.

It could be argued it's closer to zero than if it were trusted

Why not implement a system similar to the difficulty of mining: ie, allow the block size to resize every hundred or so blocks to something like 30% larger than average block size of the last hundred or so blocks?

Only in the sense that one literally depends on the other

while that's a legitimate concern for those, is there any reason to suspect my proposed solution wouldn't scale with network growth and not artificially or unnecessarily? In other words, wouldn't those concerns be alleviated in part by the fact that as the network of nodes grows, and number of transactions, and bitcoin health in general, that if you want to run a full node the ability to process that much data and bandwidth is just part of the deal? Why are we restricting block size artificially so that as many machines as possible in poor network conditions can be a full node?

Nothing I just read indicated the person you are responding to thought it was right thing. He said Gavin was *trying* to do the right thing and I agree. A misguided effort doesn't negate his intentions.

I'm somewhere between 99% and 100% certain nobody credible is advocating for 8 GB blocks, now or in 10 years. Don't be absurd.

Terrific contribution, thank you

Probably cheaper than an audit? And with better incentive to find weakness?
