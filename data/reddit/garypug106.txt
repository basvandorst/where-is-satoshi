I love how the old Bitcoin faithful are quick to say BCC is shit dump it lmao!! 
I believe in Bitcoin but also believe in BCC and alt coins, Bitcoin has had its problems before and will continue to have problems like any other coin, BCC is only 4 days old the hash rate will be adjusted the only reason it's having problems is because everyone is trying to dump it as fast as possible which is why it's so slow! 
In time Bitcoin will grow to be worth 2,3,4x times the price it is now and when that happens there is only 21 million not enough for the whole world without the price getting far to expensive for most even when people can buy fractions of a Bitcoin that's when BCC and alt coins will then see massive rises!
In closing I believe in Bitcoin but the world is big enough for more than just 1 coin.

Trolls just love to down vote even you have a point greedy fucks!

You speak true btc takes forever to confirm unless you pay huge fees that's what these greedy miners want and all people do is down vote you sad world we live in!
People say btc is slow because we have joined in its infant stage lmao it's nearly 10years old now!!

Haha pmsl yep loads of people said it wouldn't, those people who said it probably wanted everyone to keep buying so the price would keep going up. 
Why mug your self and buy when it's high all you need is patience and buy when it drops ☺ ��!!

Bitcoin was always going to drop in price,  the higher btc price the more risk is involved with bigger losses so when it starts to drop some people are more likely to panic sell forcing the price down even more! 
 China have helped speeding this up a lot,  this is why I don't buy when it's having a crazy price rally otherwise you get ripped off. 
People who hold loads of bitcoin always hype it up more so they can get as much as they can for it, I'm glad it's coming down in price for a few reasons big miner fee's started to become a joke way too expensive greedy miner's, Mark up price on when you buy btc was also getting expensive.

So what about fees for a start last year bitcoin was £300 fees was 10p now its £4000 fees are £1 plus surely miners don't need the extra fees because bitcoin is worth more?
Waiting times can take hours unless you pay at least £1 it's not right other alt coin transactions are pretty much instant for less than a penny. 
If you want to do loads of little trades for small purchases they can become pretty expensive! 
So you feel as though you only want to move large amounts in one go rather than paying way more for loads of small transactions, so small every day purchases become not worth it. 
Do you honestly think bitcoin will always be the  leader just because it was the first?
I'm not trying discredit bitcoin I want it to succeed but there's a lot of people that won't have any criticism about bitcoin even if it is genuine.

Haha we will see if btc drops after and there's no resolve to the slow transaction times or fees no change its just frustrating!
Plus people can down vote as much as they want but if btc don't sort problems it has it could be over taken by another coin people will think I'm mad for saying this but only time will time! 
Just because btc was first and ahead by miles at the moment look at AOL, Yahoo 20 years ago everyone thought they would be the future now it's Google and Amazon!!
Don't get me wrong I love that bitcoin started it all but it's stupid that the price keeps rising when it has problems like scalability, way too high fees and long waiting times!!

Lmao this rise is due to another fork/split bitcoin gold all because whales are stocking up to get free bitcoin gold. Seriously why can't btc get it right fees are too high and the speed is slow segwit2 was ment to fix the problems now we are told it's because there isn't enough segwit2 wallets ready yet lmao what a joke once bitcoin gold is out the price will drop again �� ��

Are you one those people who only believe in bitcoin then just because it was first? Did you happen to get loads when it was cheap? 
My point is bitcoin is £2200 each atm so if someone buys 1 bitcoin at this price to make 100% bitcoin has to rise to £4400 each where as for an alt coin to make 100% it only has to rise a little look at dash, zec cash and etherium!

There is no point in trying to mine bitcoin now too many people are doing it and plenty of company's started buying/ making super rigs to mine bitcoin so unless you have loads of money to buy hardware to try and compete with all those already mining there's no point. Also the electricity it costs to run some of these mining rigs is stupidly expensive!  If you want to mine look at alt coins or staking coins (pos) use minimum power by just running a client but you do have to buy and hold the coins first in order to receive stakes. 
Then when your ready you can sell your mined alt coins or staked coins for btc :-)

Average people don't understand you can buy fractions of a bitcoin pmsl who are you a superior person! Who wants to buy fractions of a coin for loads of money!! 
I just buy alt coins instead :-)
