Yeah, something is wrong with the bills. There are too many of them!
Surely the government would prevent such an occurrence from happening. It's definitely shopped.

Price won't follow. Historical data has shown and shown again that difficulty follows price.
It's not to say that price won't go up, but it's not correlated to the difficulty. Not everyone is a miner.

The network allows a certain amount of free transactions in a given period. You should be fine.
You can always remove the transaction from your wallet and make one with a fee later, if it becomes an issue.

These guys are great. I used to be a customer of their NetDNA product, not MaxCDN, but they're backed by the same infrastructure.
Glad to see they're accepting Bitcoin!

This site looks familiar, if not exactly to Bitme, which was shutdown earlier.
Looks like they wanted to reevaluate their position in the Bitcoin market with a lawyer after FinCEN released their guidance. This is good news.

I haven't seen any major lag recently; they're doing a great job.
