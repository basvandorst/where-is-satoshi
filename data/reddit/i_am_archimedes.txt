this is as stupid as saying "bitcoin will never be stable"


[why do people with intellectual disabilities post so much on the internet?](


you def need something. life woulda given you a big break if you bought bitcoin on the top of the last 'bubble' and hodl


at most gold was *the* world reserve currency up until the 1970s and still is for many countries


jmbullion.com you can buy gold priced with bitcoin


you dont do those things with other currencies because fiat currency tends to be inflationary not deflationary. hi im part of the universe, so this is the universe telling you sorry if math is too hard for you

2% inflation rate means $1 becomes worth half as much in 35 years.
Bitcoin is up 15000000% since inception, and is deflationary by design

the cia and fbi and nsa all lied about unconstitutional nsa spying. the obama state dept rescinded the leakers passport during his travels while in russia because they thought russia would hand him over. russia refused

individuals in the market like you and i sell and buy the futures. the cboe just sets the rules (which are pretty dumb rules). there is no prohibition from us buying and selling btc on our own

russia collusion is clearly bullshit
the fbi and cia want you to believe russia is undermining american democracy because the agencies were caught demonstrably undermining american democracy thanks to snowden and they couldnt get russia to hand him over

1) they only get gains by selling their ownership. you are free to own any company on the stock market; you're not forced to own the bad ones. since you don't own stock, the market loses those signals you would contribute, which means the market is more likely to place value where you don't think it should be.
2) robinhood is free trades
3) play with your own money, paying someone else to do it is dumb unless you're dumb too
4) investing in publicly traded btc companies is an option
5) triple leveraged etfs are a thing
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:25:22
you are forced to have at least 25k to sell stuff the same day you buy stuff
you are forced to borrow money from people if you want to spend the money that you get from selling stuff on the same day
hedge funds have 1000s of regulations to comply with to protect the little guy. don't have to comply if you only have accredited investors

You are reading the real reason why evil people crash markets.
The median home sale price surpassed the 2007 peak in 2013. Young people aren't buying houses because of record student loan debt, so fundamentally the housing market should be worse off than how it was in 2009. Except, we have had almost 6 years of even higher prices.

On days like today it's really easy to tell when evil bankers are selling their crypto assets to try to create a short squeeze in the S&amp;P right before they crash stock market again
