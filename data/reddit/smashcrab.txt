He's definitely Wright :P

No refund, no response, depressed that I didn't read the bitcointalk thread before ordering 
@_date: 2014-01-13 01:37:18
I'm still waiting for my refund, came here to post the same thing.. 
I emailed them 2 days ago with no response yet :(
@_date: 2011-07-24 04:01:19
I'm interested - I'll invest $10-$50 depending on what ASICMiner's response is.. Hopefully it happens but I don't have much hope :o/

Sounds amazing, but I can't see it taking off without it being open sourced. Either you do it, or the competition does. Great work either way

I used online bank transfers mostly, some face trades too
@_date: 2013-05-19 07:56:17
Best idea ever.
@_date: 2013-08-01 22:06:40
Awesome work guys, keep it up :)

I'd love some of these, but theres no aussie shipping option :(
@_date: 2013-05-17 13:06:18
twotinytots.com.au accepts bitcoin as well :)
@_date: 2013-03-21 22:39:41
Omnicoins is back up, looking at using that (unless bitpiggy is able to respond in time)
@_date: 2013-06-01 23:00:32
If you're not paying for it, you're the product.

As an aussie - ausbitbank, sydneybtc, bitbankau, coinz

Registered an acct there moment ago, looks like a good option. Can anyone verify that they've done trades of at least this volume recently ? Any idea if the "minutes" turnaround time from bank deposit confirmation to btc recept is realistic for Aussies ?

You bastard - That's hilarious. I thought I'd just witnessed my first 71k throwaway tip from a new btc millionaire!
Registered with the tipbot now and will be randomly sharing the love with the impending flood of new users. I'm just so excited and happy to be a here for this moment in history :)

A simple API (or just a plaintext version) for viewing the current votes by hour would be awesome :)
@_date: 2013-07-21 00:57:08
Maybe right now, but things change constantly. I've made decent money this week through local bitcoins alone :)
@_date: 2013-07-20 08:22:31
I've found a lot of good deals on localbitcoins.com lately, often under market. I've dealt with AusBitBank, SydneyBTC, BitBankAU, CoinhubAU and others and received fast service and good rates :)

Amount:	฿13.43870000 for $1000.00 AUD (including $0.50 fee)
Was rejected..
ZIGGAP order policy failure: This transaction would put the user over the hard limit of $1000.00 USD per day.

This. That particular wiki page is very tech/formula heavy though, does anyone have a similar page explaining the general concepts ?
I have a lawyer mate that I know would be absolutely fascinated with the future/current possibilities of this, but I don't want to scare them off or have them glaze over at the technical side of it all..
@_date: 2013-07-10 03:49:14
.... Why ?
If its a question for Zefir, have you tried messaging directly ?
I'm curious why you'd make an account just to ask this, with no followup info or reasoning..

If only folding also paid my power bill :(
@_date: 2013-06-04 00:58:35
Ordered one 3 weeks ago, paid extra, nothing yet.
@_date: 2013-07-27 22:37:44
Localbitcoins.com , or sell them to me real cheap ;)
