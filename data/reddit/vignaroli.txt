I don't know what you mean by bad.  The profit margins are very low.

Nah.  you need a better understanding of the trustless decentralized network.  There's no forced community.  You're motivated by supply and demand of tokens in the network.  
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:52:49
they might reduce mining and use the ipo money to prop up bch more.

Go to coinbase and buy whatever you feel comfortable with.  
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:14:56
I didn't say it was, but monero / cryptonight will continue to fork away from centralized control and bitmain running the show.

Hey. Look it's the Electroneum dev staff.  
@_date: 2018-05-21 02:36:11
Not true.  Most of the monero forks are keeping asics at bay while ethereum is ok with asics one day then the next day they're anti mining centralization.  So the ethereum community is trying to figure out where they really stand.  Sia coin just gave in way too early imo.  It'll be interesting to see who else let's bitmain run their show.  As for me I'm sticking with cryptonight and monero.  
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:56:15
They both fine investments.  Crypto just has higher variance.

Please don't change the content in your thread.  This makes no sense when you ask a completely different question.  
@_date: 2018-06-15 08:52:58
You get face palm for that...  If you really want to understand google asic versus cpu.  ASIC is a hard code lttle circuit that does one thing and that asic has many many many of those hard coded circuits running in parallel that can only do one thing.  It's one stupid sha256 math problem.  A cpu on the other hand has tons and tons of circuits that do many things all those other things will not make a cpus sha256 calculator go any faster.  
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:10:20

@_date: 2018-06-17 11:11:20
Your statement does not make sense.  People are not their own bank in any system.  If you're trying to say that people don't like decentralized systems then you're in the wrong neighborhood.
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:22:02
Your posts are about the worst around Mr "we'll never see 6k again"
@_date: 2018-06-17 04:56:33
Yes. Coinbase just proves the point that cryptos are needed. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 13:43:50
btc transaction fees are significantly down and bch isn't and won't hold it's value so I really stay away from bch.  
@_date: 2018-06-15 08:37:05
Computers even "super" computers use cpus.  cpus can't keep up with an asic designed to only hash sha256.  asics are single purpose machines that can do only one thing, but they do that one thing really really fast and with great effeciency.  A cpu deployed is a multipurpose system that needs to be able to address the full range of compute.  As someone said this is like trying to compare apples to aircraft carriers.

I guess your point is that miners would be rational and shutdown operation when it becomes unprofitable.  When mining production stops covering the cost of electricity and cannot make a contribution to cover the hardware and other capital cost you would still have speculative miners.  So I do not think your statement holds water.  I know McAfee used this to base his estimate and I think it may be flawed due to homan natur shifts in markets and shifts in technolgy.
