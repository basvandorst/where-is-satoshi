A desktop can do everything that a smartphone can do. But there is a reason why there is a bigger market in smartphones than PC - ease of use &amp; convenience.

I get your thinking. But why will you trust your smartphones with blockchain transactions, when you dont trust your PC?

We considered that approach. There are security loopholes in that which is probably why ledger stopped support 2 years back. You could read the whitepaper on the website for more info for our decision.

Hahahaha. Its obscurity till we launch. I don't feel that to be a problem to be honest. We will be very open about our product with parts of it may even be open source. On top of that, we will have all the security audits of the product. Plus it won't be connected to the internet also. So that's that.

How about a hardware wallet in the shape of a mobile case to eliminate the risks of mobile software wallets. Just found them -  They are market testing right now.

Apologies to you sir. I completely get your concern. The only ways we have right now to justify whether someone is potential customer is to understand the problems through a 15 min call or the chatbot on the website. You can sign up today also, and get to know everything when we officially launch.

What I would suggest is hardware wallet in the shape of the mobile case. No more centralized exchanges, no more risks of software wallets all with a highly mobile cold wallet. Try this -

We will be releasing the required details in due time, sir. But we have to stay dark for security reasons. Apologies for everything.

People I was working on a hardware wallet which is shaped as a mobile cover. I think when decentralized exchanges go mainstream, we need a hardware wallet for the mobile phone. Check it out on

Hello, I completely agree to your criticism. We are currently operating in stealth. We have included questions in the Facebook chat bot on the website and we will contact you after you fill that. We are taking only personalized feedback after we get to know whether you are indeed a potential customer. Sorry for the inconvenience.
