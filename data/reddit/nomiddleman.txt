Miners prioritize based on fee per kB of transaction data.

If that is the only payment they ever receive then yes. Also you would incur the fees since you would most likely be sending the money to them and opening the channel. However if you each already had a channel open you could send to them without opening a channel through routing, instantly and for a small routing fee.

Electrum and Exodus are my preferred wallets. Both support HD addresses and Segwit Bech32.

Very cool! I would be interested in using the logo on my website. Would this be possible? 
Awesome site btw!
A little plug follows, not interested in making money but want to continue Satoshi’s original idea of removing the middleman, extended specifically to e-commerce.
I see that you are using Woocommerce. I built a free crypto gateway that allows you to accept bitcoin using a master public key and it generates unique address for every order. Payment directly to your wallet. Automatically processes the orders once payment is confirmed on the blockchain. It will also let you accept 42 other cryptos if you are so inclined. It’s on the Wordpress.org plugin marketplace just search ‘nomiddleman crypto’.

Here is the link for the plugin: [

Looks pretty straightforward. Thank you for the link.

We currently utilize block explorer APIs for transaction information. The specific APIs we use differ between different cryptos and if the store owner decides to use static addresses or a Master Public Key (these can be easily viewed in the source code). 
We support all SegWit static addresses in the core plugin. We also currently support Legacy SegWit and SegWit P2SH MPKs with a paid extension to support future development.

What e-commerce platform are you using?
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:33:57
This will always be free and open source!

You have two options for wallet addresses. You can either enter your actual wallet address or enter the Master Public Key to generate a new address for each order. Since the derivation key determines the MPK we don't need it at all, nor would we want it, as we would require your seed to generate MPKs via the derivation key you entered.


If a customer places an order and does not fulfill the order within the designated cancellation time (plugin setting) we then will reuse that address for another order since no funds were sent. We never use an address that has any previous or current balance.


Simple, it's not needed, we simply display a QR code for the customer that they send the funds to. There is no separate payment gateway necessary.

Exodus is a software wallet that has been reliable for awhile now if you need a multi crypto wallet. Else run the core wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:32:48
This is great. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:45:20
Can’t wait! Thanks to the producers and thanks to the sponsors and donators!

This would require a broker third party. There would be fees for the credit card transaction AND the conversion to fiat.

This doesn’t include LN right? Is this because more people are using SegWit?
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:25:15
If you need any help let us know!

Our gateway is much easier to use, simply enter your wallet address and you are accepting crypto immediately. No account is necessary with us. No API keys required for the payment gateway to work. We don't collect ANY information on users or transactions. The only way we know if you are using our gateway is if you tell us. 
We also don't see the need to force a merchant to run a full node with our software, so that means you do not have to pay for something like BTCPay Server Hosting. No waiting for a full node with custom software to sync. We believe you can see with your own wallet if the transaction has been verified and utilize Blockchain APIs to automate order processing. 
While our product does not scale as well as a self hosted solution for stores with several thousand orders a day, it will get most stores up and running quickly without going through loads of documentation.

Then all you have to do to receive bitcoin is display you address and maybe a QR code for your customers, no API necessary.
If you need to convert a price, try cryptocompare’s API.

Just wanted to preface these answers by saying we aren't a solution for large stores with several hundred orders an hour, yet. We are catering to the small to medium sized stores to help them start accepting crypto.


There is no software outside of the plugin running on your site. We perform SPV to verify the funds have been received.


With the current implementation, manually cancelling the orders will cause the addresses not to be reused. We will be implementing a setting for address reuse upon cancellation in the next version. Thanks for pointing this out.

LN integration is a top priority right now.
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:19:04
It’s safe in the fact that nobody can spend your funds with it, however anybody with it can easily calculate the amount of funds associated with the MPK and see every transaction to any address associated with the MPK.
