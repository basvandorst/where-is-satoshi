Fair enough. I can prove when I bought the BTC. However, I guess this issue would only arise if the deposit needed to be investigated. At that point the customer would have to explain the source of funds.

I did wonder about this. Presumably, algorithms decide whether a transaction is "suspicious". However, at some point a human will get involved. Wouldn't it be helpful for the human to see that the customer went to the bank first before making the transaction?

Thanks. I appreciate the upbeat response. I do think it's easy to be paranoid (rather than merely cautious) because of the horror stories. As you say, good news is infrequently reported.
The bank reference says something like: "CFLHVGBP 8007, received from Coinfloor Limited.” so it's obvious it is from an exchange (if one bothers to check who Coinfloor Ltd are).

I did think about this but it might look weird to have 20 consecutive weeks of 10,000 leaving the account. Or perhaps not.

Are you in the US or UK (or elsewhere)?

What exactly would an accountant do? An accountant is for working out your taxes. That is not my concern. 
Do you know of a UK based accountant with knowledge of crypto and relationships with major UK high street banks? If so, please let me know.

It is scary that I, an innocent person, feel the need to spend hours investigating how I can convert some of my BTC into fiat without being considered a criminal. 
Two months ago, 10 BTC was $190,000. Many people will have turned a few thousand from 2014 into the above figure. Are they not allowed to convert to fiat without being seen as shady?

I don't think a bank (as opposed to an exchange) is interested in blockchain analysis. I'm sure they're more concerned with whether or not a large transaction is deemed "suspicious".

That's a nice idea. And, in fact, at some point I probably would want a mortgage.
