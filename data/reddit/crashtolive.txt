Great write-up. 
But why risk the 24 words in digital format at all? Why not just keep it on paper? Seems like an unnecessary risk.

Good stuff. Thanks.

Nice work, but no. We’re not changing it.

She can be anti-vax or anti-anything but she's clearly pro-Bitcoin and that's all that matters. :)

I want a framed print. Can I pay you in bitcoin?

BCH side gets more publicity because guys like Roger Ver know how to get lots of coverage. BTC side has no "face" any more. That's both good and bad.

It was unanimous, then it wasn't.

Most people in this sub tend to grossly exaggerate their net worth.

The vast majority of my wealth is in retirement accounts (IRA, 401K) so I don't have much of a choice. Fingers crossed for an ETF in the next 12 months.

Very good article. I like the idea of making mining more accessible. But, I don't think that we will ever live in a world where a universal basic income will work the way you want it to work.

The huge war will happen when 2 equally popular sides claim the Bitcoin name. What we're dealing with now is miniscule in comparison to what that will cause.

What good is an intrinsic value if there’s nobody on the planet that is willing to buy at said value?
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:12:32
Not compared to a couple of months ago!
Again I could have sent it for 25 cents but I wanted to ensure a speedy transaction to be courteous.

Lasagna pizza!

It’s ok! Never really blows me away. The owner said he’s been in BTC since 2013 and made a few bucks along the way!

This is great. I'd like to find a meetup in NYC that discusses that kind of stuff.

I don't care how secure Bitcoin is. If Craig Wright ever is able to prove that he's Satoshi, we're all fucked. That dude is cancer to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:49:44
You should do some more research before you reach this level of condescension.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:47:17
Yes, he was ok with just seeing me send it. I’m sure he saw it in the mempool within a few seconds.

Just off Grove St PATH at the other end of the Newark Ave pedestrian street. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:19:15
Yep, covered half of the transaction fee! (I was going to cheap out and do a super economy fee but then decided to do it at the “normal” rate so the pizza guy wouldn’t have to wait hours and hours.)
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:55:51
Thanks for sharing! Didn’t know he had a Patreon. Just signed up for the $10/mo support.

New York City. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:48:16
$1.47 using Copay’s “normal” rate. Normally I’d drop it down to around $.25 if I were ok with a potentially slow transaction but didn’t want to make him wait. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:16:07
Naw, I bought another $200 worth of BTC on Coinbase immediately after. ��
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:54:44
Me too! Would love a happy hour in NYC.

Also note that he gave me a 10% discount, which would have more than paid for a 25 cent transaction fee.

Unfortunately there is no good way to get BTC into a retirement account right now without a trusted 3rd party involved. I doubt the govt will ever approve of BTC directly held in an IRA. I’m saving for retirement expecting to be forced to pay taxes on my crypto earnings. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 01:15:43
Stock splits are highly controlled.
Bitcoin forks are complete fucking chaos.
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:05:46
Wow. I wasn't expecting exchanges to freeze BTC wallets so soon. Time to batten down the hatches &amp; move EVERYTHING to offline wallet!
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:14:13
Very fustrating.

Yeah, I got caught off guard on Bittrex. But just a few bucks worth of BTC in there thankfully. Already had 75% on Trezor, and just got my remaining 25% off GDAX (they may not be far behind Bittrex).
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:07:13
Articles like this make me extremely confident that the price of bitcoin will continue to go up exponentially. The fact that intelligent people still can't wrap their heads around bitcoin shows how much growth is still yet to come. Because yes, they WILL get it eventually, just like we did. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:35:00
Same.
