I finally bit the bullet, bought BTC and pulled out of Gox.  I hope they survive this, but I'm done with the ride.
Good luck, Gox.

Don't worry.  We'll still find money to bomb other countries for vague reasons.

Damn, you're right about needing the blockchain to create the raw transaction.  It has to have up-to-date information about the addresses it's signing for.
Once you have to keep the blockchain updated, there's an attack vector.

I had this very idea last week.  Something definitely worth considering.

There's a serious difference between seizing a giant brick of paper dollars and gaining access to a private key.  The dollars have a single copy of themselves in the universe, and can be secured entirely through physical means.  The private key (wallet) is merely information and can be copied infinitely, giving anyone with that information access to sign transactions in the blockchain.
Now, the appropriate thing for the FBI to do if they want any kind of control here, is to sign a transaction of these 27k XBT to 'move' them into a wallet where the knowledge of the private key is still limited to them.  At that point, the original key is not worth much outside of evidence in court.  The problem they're likely facing is either (1) they don't have a person on hand knowledgeable enough to do that or (2) they aren't sure what the legal ramifications are of moving the XBT.  If they move the 'coins', was that akin to taking seized paper bills and locking them in a vault?  Or would it destroy the chain of evidence and ruin their court case?  They're likely not sure given the new ground everyone is treading here, so they're likely being cautious.
Information is tough to control.  Bitcoin is going to drive new innovations in information management as it becomes more valuable, that that's a very good thing.

While I don't agree with much of Ayn Rand's ideas, this one is penitent to your post:
"There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced or objectively interpreted – and you create a nation of law-breakers – and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's the system, Mr. Reardon, that's the game, and once you understand it, you'll be
much easier to deal with." ("Atlas Shrugged", 1957)

Nor are computer algorithms.  A public game with money on the line is likely to quickly be rife with computers playing computers.  The humans will quickly lose out if the game is too simple.
 On the other hand, it could drive a serious improvement in AI capabilities.  Too bad it will likely not be a published result.

That's both very cool to have, and somewhat scary.  Public transactions are all too identifiable if the total amounts are known.

800k means I'd have to work part time for the rest of my life at a minimum wage job just to keep health benefits.  No, it's not insanely wealthy, but it's a lifetime of income for a family of 4 in a more rural area of the US.

Sounds like a video transfer of the raw transaction as generated by the offline machine would be an option.
We could also dust off those serial console cables and go old tech.  The likelihood anyone writes tools to look for serial, PPP, plop, slip, ipx, etc. Is quite low.
Also, if the cold machine dials into the console of the online one, you really can't get traffic back if you only use raw terminal protocols.  Just don't make a network out of it.  Yes, there's likely a path there, but it is a real tight one.
I like the videos transfer of the signed raw transaction the most.
Or even get a chain printer to print the transaction out on.  Then load it into the online machine.

They could, but more likely it would be wrapped up into the equipment package and service provider's system.  The govt would just see the USD at the end of the line.
I wouldn't want to have a GovCoin, but I can definitely foresee the US government trying such a thing to make an "official" digital currency that they control.

It's a protective step, but still security through obscurity.  It does make finding the transaction into a knapsack problem, which is reasonably tough.

It's worth the same as any other thing: It's worth whatever someone will give you for it.
That value is highly dependent upon situation and definitely changes over time.  Yes, BTC is in the ballpark of $120 right now, depending upon who you ask and trade with.  That's a notable amount of money, so do your research before investing anything, which is true any time anyway.

The only way I can see is to make the source of money 'given' to you harder to trace.  For example, if you take your illegal dollars, sell them for XBT, then set up a legitimate business.  Pay yourself in XBT for non-existent clients and use many sending addresses.
People suggesting you obfuscate the route are leaving out the hop to legal stage.  Normally you have a real business that you pad the income on.  This does take work, but I won't cry for you as you get paid  4x the market rate.
 The XBT only makes the money trail harder to follow.  Basically, your 'customers' become more anonymous.
