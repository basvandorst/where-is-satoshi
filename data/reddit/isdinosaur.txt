Use GDAX

Coinbase is the easiest way if you’re totally new to the whole thing

Ledger Nano S (only buy from official site) is cheap and very easy to set up and use.

I’ve never used it (HODL!) but it’s apparently same company as Coinbase but much much cheaper

no, you are not right.

You’re welcome.  Also consider transferring your bitcoin to a wallet (I used Breadwallet) as then you have full ownership of your coin. 
You can also use GDAX (same company as Coinbase) though it’s more confusing!
If you plan to invest more, a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano S is a safer solution for storage once purchased.

I will, when the ledger arrives ��

Do it. 
I’m not saying I could, or that I’d even want it, but man if you’re gonna say you can, then do it.

Engraved into something? I’m considering letter punching mine into stainless steel when it arrives

I too chose low fees, though I've seen reports of other users who went with standard fees and had the same issue. 
Fingers crossed friend.
