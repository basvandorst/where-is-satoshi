Not everyone can use Bitcoin, most people in the world don't have the access or knowhow, or desire to. It's simplistic to assume that "I know it, so everyone else must too". Other than that...

I agree, too many people try to pidgeon-hole and categorise 'other's' and in the process polarise what would otherwise be a civil discussion. Polarizing is easy, being simple is easy, that's why people with agendas do it. It's devisive and socially destructive, irregardless of what kind of society anyone wants.
