Signifies Bitcoin in relation to a penny.. 
Foreshadowing for when Bitcoin is as common man as a penny is to us now. It’s undeniable Crypto is the future but which crypto who knows ����‍♂️ if bitcoin holds it may be the future fiat for all cryptos which constantly fluctuate in conversions depending on what crypto is accepted at certain public businesses

‘ it costs $7500 through the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) to prevent one malaria-related death. This figure may seem high, but based on existing evidence is actually one of the most cost-effective ways to save a life in the developing world. We can compare this to wealthy countries like the US where, depending on age, it could cost between $790,000 – $13,100,000 to save a life.’ 
[Raising for Effective Giving (REG)](  uses ‘effective altruism’ to calculate maximum impact of each dollar spent. very interesting organization &amp; although i have no ties to it whatsoever i figured id add it to the conversation that everyone is having &amp; to answer your question AND if just ONE person donates itd be worth it

Youd be upset to find out that a lot of charities actually dont do much for the future of humanity compared to how much they do for the presence of their big bank accounts 
And there comes the question what is the future of humanity ? ALS raised millions that helped thousands of people yet that same millions couldve helped millions of Africans from death (not just a disease , although a horrible one). 
We as humans are always trying to ‘save’ the world. The world’s falling apart &amp; there will always be negative consequences to certain human/nature events that will continue on until the end of Earth. 
If you do donate I just hope you make sure that money is allocated correctly. May I insert a [recommendation]( for a seriously well intentioned foundation started by poker players where the objective is to maximize lives saved vs dollar spent. Youd think all charities would optimize their allocation of funds like this but A LOT dont &amp; even if they did in a lot of cases charities receive donations out of sympathy &amp; although American lives w diseases are improved/cured, the impact could be much more substantial.
