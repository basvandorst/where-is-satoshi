Hi everyone!
I've decided to start a new series of videos that will cover Bitcoin news but most likely will focus on new and upcoming Altcoins along with scattered videos about Altcoin topics.
Here is the first video where I talk about the Bitcoin's price and give a little insight on a certain perspective.
I would highly appreciate feedback and as well as what you guy would like to see in future videos.

For a non-troll answer, you can pay and support the film by watching it on Vimeo:
Otherwise, torrents are easy.

Really well made and a good watch for those who need to catch up on Bitcoin's history or if they're new to Bitcoin. Even if you're an expert, I'd still say to watch it.
Watch however you'd like but be sure to donate if they get that set up or [buy it on their website.](

I'm gonna have to go with 'none'.

Enjoy! Always open to feedback.

Sweet. I'm going to be all over this.

Interesting. If that's true, there's only a few million people out there who's really interested in bitcoin and just imagine if it's a few hundred million in the future.

Good to hear I'm not alone!

Good point. 
Funny thing about perspective is that it's universal and that a lot of people other than myself is actually using the service pretty easily so far.
The video's more of a joke and to show what it looks like to use it for those who don't want to sign up just yet. :)

Hey everyone! 
Here's the next episode of Cryptobound, weekly Bitcoin and altcoin news I find so you don't have to. This is news within the last week if you've missed it and as well as altcoins that's been released as well. 
I'm open to any and all feedback and would be great to hear it.

I used to work for Netflix as a rep. The content team is really just a Google docs form/internal inquiry form that goes to corporate nowhere. I and other coworkers usually don't know where it really went, just that we have to report suggestions. It's usually used for movie/tv show suggestions and UI features. 
However, if the suggestion keeps getting suggested, it's known that it'll be implemented later on so it wouldn't hurt to try.
