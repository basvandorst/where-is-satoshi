There are some VERY useful and promising projects that are currently being used and many more that will be. Do your own research because you have no idea what you're saying.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:46:35
Going off of that logic shouldn't every coin just get it's face ripped off besides Bitcoin? Look at the top 10, lots of research and projects.
And if you're going off of immediate utility, there are 10's of coins have better present day use cases than Bitcoin.

LMAO I ain't clicking that fucking link

What type of fee am I looking to pay with an ATM?
Edit: Found one but they charge a 5% fee :'(
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:18:06
.25%? Is this standard for all users? I was about to buy on coinbase but 3.75% seems really dumb.
Edit: I'm also Canadian

"It's fucking magic internet money"
I'm stealing this saying forever when I talk about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:26:46
Sounds pretty advanced to an idiot like myself. Where's the step by step tutorial @ though :)
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:50:06
Lol I suck
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:46:37
Noo I'm not verified yet to buy! Where can I buy BTC from a Canadian bank without verification right away without a crazy fee?
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:43:46


Well shieeet dawg, clearly I'm new to this :(
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:58:59
So the price will certainly fall if the SEC disapproves?
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:48:26
So there's basically no reason to pay that 4% fee then if anyone could just do this, huh?
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:48:54
Yeah, so I was thinking of waiting a couple of months until it does drop, the only reason why I'm hesitant is if the SEC accepts on March 11 I would assume the price is going to increase a lot, no?
@_date: 2018-10-08 02:28:39
Yes and everyone is going to upvote your post in agreement and then tomorrow we’re going to go back to upvoting license plates and what not 
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:16:19
Holy shit why do people do this to themselves? Store your coins somewhere safer lmao
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:00:47
The fact that it has real world utility for anyone is worthy enough of a post.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:13:30
That's a pretty significant point that you made that is blatantly untrue. Should probably edit that out. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:50:51
Might not be a bad thing to those of us who missed the BTC boat D: 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:21:25
Best way to promote using bitcoins is to use bitcoins to purchase and then immediately supplement by buying back the amount of BTC you spent with USD. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:10:30
I'm not so sure about that one ....
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:28:38
Good post. I'll see you all back here tomorrow for more memes, crying about prices and your usual shitposts. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:15:49
How many times are you gonna scream hodl to make yourself feel better about a bear market? I remember when these discussion boards were about real contributions and not just fixated on the price tag. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:51:53
When I purchase something I try to find the cheapest deal and search for alternatives. If peoples' interest is being peaked and they are buying after researching, that is definitely a good sign. There are many other things people could invest in.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:33:15
In all fairness, OP searched "bit" try searching for "eth" and see how many really pop up 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:01:11
Oh you're right. Oh well, further proving my point that there are way more than 8 phonies for ETH and BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:07:32
Just stop looking at the fucking price if you clearly have no self control
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:38:12
Aside from other responses, encourages the use of Bitcoin for one of its original purposes is a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:36:45
Oh god don't be this guy

As the great Dan Bilzerian once said "Money buys pleasure, it does not buy happiness"
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:43:18
Dollar cost average and buy the dip. Glhf
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:10:41
From everywhere. There's actual new money coming into the market. It's able to withhold pressure that comes from China ban, Russia ban, ICO ban, massive headlines, etc. It has the fundamentals and the TA that indicates there's no reason to trend downwards or bubble. 
If I weren't on mobile I could type a paragraph for why I think there's a lot of support and it won't bubble. I'm not some crazy blind BTC supporter but I think you're doing yourself a disservice and being unrealistic by denying the level of support and spewing a bubble is coming because you or someone has a "feeling".
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:33:03
A lot of support. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:43:48
I don't understand why you a dip is supposed to come?
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:22:16
Okay fair enough. What makes you think Bitcoin is in a bubble? There has to be some logic behind that claim 
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:02:49
Still haven't bought and I'm kicking myself ugh
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:21:36
Stupid person question time. Why would the price continue to rise with limited supply? I get demand would have to rise but why would demand rise with the quantity being capped ?
@_date: 2017-07-18 01:39:39
People keep saying bitcoin can reach 500k. With a 21M supply this would give it a 1,050,000,000,000 market cap. Is this really plausible? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:16:01
Coinsquare says .1% for all trades, this is just for individual trades, right? Is it listed where the commission rate is simply for depositing onto the exchange?
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:39:11
nah im good
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:11:08
I live in Canada, not sure if that has to do with anything but Coinbase will not allow me to link my debit card unless I'm completely missing something.  I go to add payment and it only has the fields for a credit card. :(
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:15:59
Soooo basically what you're getting at is ... HODL
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:31:14
Maybe not for Canadian users? Not for me. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:14:27
Let's say I buy BTC the day before August 1st, I will still be matched with BCC? 
Also how does the match work exactly, will the amount we're matched with going to vary from exchange to exchange? How is that determined
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:53:44
Would rather not get killed on their fees :/

So my seed is my password. Write that thing down and let nobody see it or know where it is. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:56:17
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:12:31
So your wallet is 100% recoverable so long as you keep your seed? 
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:11:48
From what I've seen 5% seems to be standard
