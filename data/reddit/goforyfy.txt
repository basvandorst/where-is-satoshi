@_date: 2018-05-20 06:28:32
yes. sometimes I think all crypto exchanges are monitored and controlled by governments (Maybe directly, indirectly and forcefully)
unless and until crypto is dittached from government money, no one is safe.

I think in future every country will have its own cryptocurrency backed by one global reserve currency i.e.bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-16 16:18:39
It is difficult for governments to directly switch to bitcoin so for some years they will try enforcing their cryptocurrency to population but as bitcoin has been time tested for every possible attack from past 9 years, more and more people will switch to decentralised btc network considering the problems and failures of govt controlled cryptocurrency during their enforcement period.
@_date: 2018-05-19 08:46:31

@_date: 2018-05-17 08:39:28
does it matter for governments?
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:44:29
but at some point in time long term holders will spend their btc not for fiat but for some goods and services.
there is no point in holding btc forever, that is dead money.
and as vendor's have to pay taxes in fiat, they will sell it for fiat.
and then governments will buy them again.
it is very illogical to assume you will buy btc but will not spend in your lifetime.
@_date: 2018-05-20 05:11:57
