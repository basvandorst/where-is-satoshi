I would be careful with Armory, I don't believe it's very well-supported/maintained anymore. 
If you don't want a hardware wallet I would also recommend Manticlops' suggestion of TailsOS &amp; Electrum. Electrum is still actively maintained and will have support for Lightning sometime in the near future.
@_date: 2019-07-19 12:41:36
That site is owned by a bad actor. I would suggest using another service like [blockstream.info](

"Before this change, it would take 1.5 * N round trips (where N is the number of hops) for the sender of an HTLC to obtain a pre-image for a successful payment. ... With this new logic, it now only takes 0.5 * N RTT for the same operation. As a result, the sender of the payment will now get the pre-image much sooner..."
Wow. If I'm reading this right, the time it takes to send a lightning transaction just decreased by 100%. Well done!

If you want a wallet for PC I would highly recommend Electrum (electrum.org). If a service requires you to either log in to use your wallet or if they ask for your private keys, walk away.

Baby steps! One should never withold upgrading a legacy system until it meets an ideal standard because that day will never come. I doubt any large, mainstream service/corp will be able to jump immediately from the legacy payment system to Lightning.
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:42:03
I would still disagree. Scanning a QR code, clicking send and watching a 0-conf transaction go through is still leagues better than any credit card-based transaction that can be disputed up to 6-months after that transaction has gone through compared to ~10 minutes with a Bitcoin payment.
Lightning is obviously the ideal to strive for though so we don't have to worry or argue about any of this. Hopefully Bakkt will help Starbucks get there sooner rather than later. Baby steps.
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:43:35

"We deal with Bitcoin for you"
Fuck that noise. You're pitching to the wrong audience mate.
@_date: 2019-03-04 23:07:27
Because we all value different things. We are also able to freely express ourselves by spending and/or accepting any currency of our choosing. Personally, I would love to freely spend and accept BTC whenever and wherever possible. Bakkt/Starbucks is looking to allow us to do just that. Even though they may not wish to accept it without converting it just yet, that is fully their choice. Baby steps.

"Bakkt is building an open, seamless global network to enable you to buy, sell, store and spend digital assets simply, safely and efficiently." - [Bakkt](
I would suggest reading up via their site and linked articles to get a better understanding of what they're going to bring to the table that's different from what's currently on offer from existing, similar services. IMO, ICE's involvement added a bit of legitimacy that companies like Microsoft and Starbucks are looking for. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 04:25:47
They most likely intended to say, "Bitcoins provable finite supply is a problem." Makes inflating an asset a bit trickier.

Cars are radically overpriced as is and all low-to-high end luxury cars are absolutely vain and unnecessary.
Buy a decent used car that does what you need it to and put the saved funds to better use. Whether it's back into your savings account, to buy some more BTC or towards a good cause, future you will be happy you did.
@_date: 2019-03-04 18:15:06
0-conf for Bitcoin is ~10 minutes. The 0-conf equivalent for a credit card transaction is ~6 months. Bitcoin is still significantly more secure than credit card transactions. Arguing that this would sour the experience is disingenuous.
Ultimately, yes, Lightning is the way to go. Hopefully they get there sooner than later so that these arguments no longer exist., but some progress is better than none.
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:02:11
Lightning would be impressive, but I imagine they're going to take this one step at a time. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:21:09

Being able to verify their own transactions along with setting up a Lightning node alongside it would be a huge benefit. I doubt that will be the case though. That service will most likely be outsourced to Bakkt.
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:47:15
Because you're most likely using a wallet that overestimates and overpays on fees. 1 sat per byte (~2 cents) is good enough like 90% of the time.

I hate being in the role of a cynical skeptic, but we can't verify that claim. Apple is great at marketing and pr.

As pointed out by another redditor, it's not necessarily a wallet, but a kit that would allow developers to produce something like a wallet. Also, I bet they nerf the rng for government agencies/groups to bruteforce any key generated using the kit too. I wouldn't trust it to generate or handle any key containing an insignificant amount of crypto.

Ah, that's unfortunate. I'm not sure how they would go about blacklisting you, but I'm sorry to hear it. Even though your phrase seems useless, I would highly recommend you remove that phrase from your previous comment and immediately sweep those funds to a new wallet if they ever become accessible again. You never know. Don't want you to lose those funds again if they ever come back!

Completely agree. WoW and Second Life are the first to come to mind as standout candidates for Lightning implementation. 
To be honest about the gambling issue though, it wouldn't surprise me if gambling laws start to loosen up pretty soon. Once Bitcoin and Lightning functionality becomes commonplace there's just no way to enforce gambling laws in their current form. It'll be too easy to circumvent them. They'll have to let up eventually, imo.

As silly as it sounds, I didn't even factor in the possibility of cheaters. It's a big issue today even without the incentive of receiving a few satoshis.
On the other hand it could be seen as a way to incentivize game developers and publishers to really start cracking down on the issue of cheating, but until then...yeah. This is why we can't have nice things.

It shouldn't surprise me that they outright ignore advice more often than not. That's unfortunate. Seems like they're more focused on pumping new content out of the pipeline than offering support for existing services. My hope is that something like Lightning will be used as a tool to encourage and incentivize developers to support and continue developing existing content that's successful. Your previous line of work sounds really interesting though. I would bet developers like you could code better bot AI than what most games offer out of the box today.
@_date: 2019-02-05 01:48:13
It's rather trivial to iterate over common derivation paths between wallets and check for funds. Future/current wallets can simply create a function that checks these paths and alert the user if there are any funds associated with the them. If so, ask the user if they would like to send those funds to a more up-to-date address.
@_date: 2019-02-06 03:07:05
I feel you. Technically, you can still mine asic resistant coins with GPU's and many attribute the rise of GPU costs to this. However, I would argue that correlation does not equal causation and that it was absolutely blown out of proportion. People just like to point and put the blame somewhere especially if that somewhere is something that they may not understand or agree with.

If you're curious about Bitcoin and the game theory surrounding it, mining is a great way to dive in and start learning. You should not expect a direct return on your investment from mining, however.

If you had to brute-force the entire path it wouldn't be trivial at all. Luckily we have certain standards and best practices that allow us to narrow our search down to certain paths. [This is a great website]( that lists a number of preset paths. Assuming the wallet you previously used stuck to the standards we should only ever need to scan the first account of each preset path in order to determine if it ever received funds. This does assume, however, that the previous wallet applied and followed these standards. If it didn't...fun and long brute-forcing sessions await.

Totally agree with you. However, nobody should be able to dictate how any individual chooses to utilize or interact with the network. We are all free to take advantage of and utilize Bitcoin as we see fit. So if people wish expose themselves to Bitcoin through an ETF they are free to do so. I, however, firmly believe in the motto, "Not your keys, not your coins." and will steer very clear of any ETF.
