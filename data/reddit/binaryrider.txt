Bitcoin is a new idea for a digital currency where there is no central authority that can control it which means it's decentralized. It exists because there is a demand for it (people like it and use it).

With a deflation based currency you can expect the economy to stagnate. Even though the U.S. has a high debt, it has the most developed economy... coincidence? I think not.

If someone offered me a billion dollars in exchange to be 2 and a half years in prison, I'd be happy to accept.

This doesn't make any sense, I kind of doubt this is true.
Having a negative interest rate makes on current account makes sense because that will focus clients to put the money in a savings account which would allow the banks to use your move to give out loans.
This is probably for current bank accounts and it's stupid in my opinion, it isn't like they are going to make money from this negative interest rate for accounts with small amounts of money in it, it's just a way to lose your clients...

Bitcoin is a free advertisement scheme, lol.
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:28:33
That's cool, I didn't know Bitcoin had a website.

People don't buy him, they buy his product. It's an unfortunate reality.
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:39:43
Well, they advertise it as a stable coin so I believe not but I may be wrong.

Can you explain why this is a bad thing?
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:44:39
Deflation is as bad as inflation for the economy.
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:53:35
I agree with that to a certain degree. What finds me interesting is their advertised Move language.
If what I believe is true, Libra will have smart contracts and will be a direct competitor to Ethereum.

No need to send BTC, just look at it and it will spew out money!
@_date: 2019-12-18 10:17:00
Should I laugh or be mad at you for advertising Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2019-04-13 08:10:44
There isn't any site for instant tra sfers, you will have to use Coinbase and withsraw it to your bank accoujt number from Revolut.

1 days still seems to much for etc...

Why does ETC take even longer? O.o
@_date: 2019-04-22 13:15:03
This is wrong in so many different levels...
Bitcoin is a blockchain.
@_date: 2019-04-27 19:09:00
Kind of agree with you. I don't believe it will help much against money laundering and fraud. Using stolen identities, ID e.g. is a norm in the blackhat world and KYC can be easily (to a degree) bypassed with it.
@_date: 2019-04-13 10:43:24
I suppose you can do that too. Usually Coinbase Pro is cheaper but since you're doing small amounts it won't matter much.

Many people fail to realize that Bitcoin is not a replacement for money but an addition to it. The idea that Bitcoin replaces money was a clever advertising idea in the early years of Bitcoin and interestingly still is quite prominent.
@_date: 2019-09-29 21:43:43
I believe that Bitcoin will replace systems for sending money overseas such as SWIFT and Wire.

This is the main idea. I believe the API keys were actually obtained from users sharing them. There are lots of bots online that claim that they auto trade and make money on autopilot. These keys could have been used for the attack.
7k Bitcoin is not a little bit of money and would take time to come across that many API keys but on the other hand, I've met people that hold multiple BTC and use those sketchy bots so anything is possible.

I never had any problems with Binance.
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:26:37
Obtaining stolen documents for this scale of an attack is not a problem. The attackers used multiple accounts for the attack in case they get blocked on one to still have a high chance of withdrawal.
Also, there is a sudden increase in trading before the withdrawal of the coins with further verifies my theory:

Time of withdrawal was  2019-05-07 17:17:18

No, it doesn't. Mark Zuckerberg's net worth is 70 billion dollars but that does not mean he has 70 billion dollars right now, he probably doesn't even have 0.1% of that.
While on the other hand, the cryptocurrencies you have, you own right now and you are able to send them right now.

I don't know. I found that the domain was bought for $5k which is crazy...
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:08:50
I don't believe so. The largest problem I can imagine is that people will want to kidnap him because of the amount of money he is holding...
There is some kind of speculation that it is some guy who went to jail at about the time when Satoshi disappeared from the Internet.
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:21:37
There is a trick you all are missing which I won't be sharing but some computer scientist can guess.
If you have the API key of some account, you can transfer its balance to any other account on the exchange.
This vulnerability is not present only on Binance but the majority exchanges.
I believe that this was a very complex and planned attack, I believe a group of people were responsible for it, it would be very hard for a single person to do all of this.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:51:09
It's a website claiming to have found the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.
I hope it is not some kind of CSW shit.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:04:29
Seems to be some kind of shitty advertisement...

How come the Bitfinex hacked coins are "unusable"?
