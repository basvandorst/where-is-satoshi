That's called a down payment son.

The only thing I don't like about coinbase is anything over $1,000 takes 4+ days to transfer from my bank to my wallet even though I did their highest level of verification, connected to a credit card, etc.  Is Circle quicker than this and can I connect it to a US bank or credit union?

With the $ you are at the whim of the Federal Reserves (a private company not part of the government) and their printing presses, and politics in Washington.  
  
With Bitcoin there is an known algorithm controlling the 'printing press.'  
  
I can't end the fed, but I can try and step around them.

The auditing and ledger system is more efficient, the books keep themselves.  The transaction fees are cheaper.  You don't have to apply for a bank account, you can make your own, anywhere in the world with internet.  
  
I travel and so does my girlfriend.  We can 'wire money' to each other as simple as sending an email without a trusted 3rd party and the fee is practically non existent.  It's like building paypal into gmail for free, removing all the send and withdrawal limits, and attaching it to your 'checking account' you opened yourself.  
  
Now, bitcoin is still early adopter phase.  It's really not that "simple" yet because you have to do some technical work and the glossy applications aren't all in place. Those that see value know it's just a mater of time.  I see value in knowing there will never be more than 21,000,000 bitcoins and I want to own some.  If you don't see value in this, bitcoin isn't for you.

Awesome, thank you sir. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 16:02:08
Thank you sir, that is my first tip.

Shit, coinbase instant per week is $1,000.  
@_date: 2014-11-01 16:02:37
Wohoo, thank you sir!

When Bubba starts accepting bitcoin watch out!

Can I turn it back into BTC?  And is it worth the same amount?  WTF, I swear I got an e-mail from coinbase telling me to do nothing if I wanted to keep it as BTC.  
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:11:17
Okay, but I had a whole coin before the split...so I just got fucked? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:50:51
I had one coin on Coinbase from like 2 years ago.  I haven't done anything with it. What do I have now?  
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:38:37
Thanks, coinbase e-mails made it super confusing.

Not anywhere in the known universe.  The entangled blockchain devices, [Ansible](  would need to be constructed together since the particles need to interact to become entangled.  Then they would have to be sent out.  Assuming no faster than light travel they would be limited to the [light cone]( from point of creation of the Ansiblechains.  Oh shit.  
This would mean in the [holographic]( theory of the universe, reality IS an Ansiblechain.  
I think I need another dab.  
So the big bang created an expanding Universal Ansiblechain recording the results of the initially set [universal constants](  We are just an experiment, a simulation.  You need the keys to the Universal Anisblechain to see the results thus far.  
Shit.  Once you have the keys, you can build your blockchain into the Universal Ansiblechain and now you are correct again.  Anywhere in the known universe...

Is Trezor safe to buy from Amazon?  The seller is listed as "Trezor" but then Trezor doesn't list Amazon as a vendor on their site.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:50:16
How do we know how many coins they have and how many have sold?

Right, what's the volume been so far this day? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:47:49
So is there anything else out there like this right now?
