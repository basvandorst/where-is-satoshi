The only legit cloud mining per say is buying bitcoins on a reaccuring schedule through some place like coinbase.... yes ..it's not mining in that sence.... but if you close your eyes..and think about it in the terms of purching 1 or 2 week long mining contracts with immediate payouts...then that imaginary   cloud mining is the safest risk.... All others are a SCAM.!!!!!

When mining on p2pool.. you are rewarded with generation coins...
I would mine them directly to paper wallets...that was stored in my save..
I value them..YES.... greater then coins I buy from coinbase...how much more???   It's a psychological value to me I guess... plus I just know that I mined them and that feels good..

I think you are confusing solar storms and EMPs. As far as I understand, a solar storm would disrupt communications and knock out the power grid and an EMPS destroys anything electronic...
As far as bitcoin goes..with the lack of electric or communications , mining in effected areas Stops!!!....We could have very very long block confirms..disrupting transaction and take forever for the difficulty to drop to something that could get us back to 10 minute block finds.. coins would not confirm or be transfered..  The biggest pools/exchanges try to sell their stock pile and tanks the coin price... pushing bitcoin back to the stone ages

If you have to worry about encrypting your private keys then you are not storing your cold wallets in a safe enough place.....if you want to store your private keys online in cloud storage..then yes ,encrypting your private keys with hard to crack passwords are a must.. but that then falls back to storing the password in a safe place..
I beleave paper wallets in a Gun SAFE ,bolted to your basement floor is a good place for unencrypted private keys and passwords for encrypted wallets..

Second... if a safe is bolted to the concrete basement floor..you are not going to simply get it off its base... 
3rd....  Do you know how hard it is to get a safe down a set of basement steps.. let alone up the steps... 
4th....if you can afford a safe and a home to bolt it to. Why isn't the alarm sounding and calling the cops...
5th.... why isn't the German Shepherd eating the burglers for dinner.
6th.... a gun safe would need a vehicle with a lift gate..you mean to tell me they are building stealth moving trucks. And why weren't the motion yard lights on..
7th... if this happened to me..I would be more Pissed that my guns in the safe were also stolen...
8th.... if your taking the time to buy a safe and bolt it down.. your going to do it the right way...if not... the safe isn't big enough!!!!
9th.... if the safe is small it wasn't hidden correctly..
10th... if crooks know about your safe full of bitcoin.. your problem is your running your mouth about your safe with bitcoins..
This is just my opinion and is by no way how I store my paper wallets in my safe.... ; )

At this point in bitcoins life, people are treating it more as a stock... people are buying into bitcoin and waiting for it to go up...Any little ups or downs cause a rush to sell or buy as if there was bad news with a tech company's product or third quarter earnings... As long as bitcoin is treated this way.... we will have these price swings......
More people need to treat bitcoin as if it were gold or silver.... hoard it away for 5+ years .... and then see what the price is... there needs to be a few more reward halving for to be realized just how rare bitcoin really is....
Then and only then can bitcoin be used as a stable means of trade....
Next ... Bitcoin must not be traded into and out of fiat currency..... 
100 years ago...you could buy a fine 3 piece suit for  a 1oz .gold coin..  And at today's prices... you can  buy a fine 3 piece suit for that same gold coin...... this is only a reference at the gold or the suit didn't change any in 100 years.... it was the fiat currency value that changed.....

Bitcoin was born and raised the correct way through the evolution of mining from CPU to GPS to FPGA to ASIC..... any new coins would have to go through a similar growth cycle. ... A new coin starting out ...say it's a sha256 coin...would be susceptible to attacks with just the smallest ASIC miner.....Or be premined or closed mined...and that defeats the open source , p2p property's of Bitcoin....
Many have tryed....and I'm sure there will be many more....But they will all trade to bitcoin....

Each Paper Safe note is printed on anti copy security paper. The 2 factor anti copy feature changes color when touched. On the back are invisible water marks that appear when rubbed with a coin. The paper has UV threats embedded in the paper during manufacture that when a UV light is cast on the note the fibers glow. The paper is reactive to solvents, bleach, and acids and will change color.. Also each note is individually numbered with a red and an invisible UV number under a holographic security sticker. Every note is embossed with the Paper Safe seal and a bitcoin logo. The notes first few designes are being finalized and the custom security paper is on order in bulk. There will be a satoshi note design that will be printed with blockchains block height hashes and other block information like date and time , nonce... that corresponds with the serial number of the note. This is still in the works . Different designs will correspond to differant block height numbers..let's say we start at block height 1000. Every tenth serial numbered satoshi note will be differant and every 100th will be something else. This will make certain notes more rare then others. No two notes will be the same.
I am a big advocate for print and hold bitcoins . Each of the production notes will be registered on the block chain with 100 satoshis. The printed address and the encryped private key will be printed on the front.. the password for the private key will be secured with a scratch off label and stamped with a tamper proof UV stamp. If you wish to keep more bitcoins in a paper safe , up to 7 addresses can be printed on the back.. the 1 bit is used to register the note to the blockchain.
What is being releases for sale now are genisus block notes... these notes have no serial number or have the number 00000 on them . These notes also are printed on less secure paper and have no address printed on them.
The purpose for the notes.. just a cool way to store your private keys, looks good in your safe, makes it easy to give as gifts. Create a collector item , and if you want to increase its value, just send a few more bits to the registering address on the front.. the key is there, just secured with the scratch off.. if your not comfortable with that then print more of your own on the back.
The registration of the note to the blockchain . This information can be used to secure your own private keys that you printed on the back..The block that your note is registered to, it's nonce could be used for the pin number for your own encryped private keys.
Yes . Bitcoin is a digital currency, this is an attempted to make bitcoins physical so you can hand them to some one in a cool , unique way.. or store them for the future in a physical form..I feel that in the future , 1 bit or 100 satoshis, could be worth a few dollars. These notes could be passes as paper currency 20 or 40 years from now... who know.
Satoshi Notes.. by Paper Safe..

Just encrypt the private with your safe combination as a password...

I think the cheapest way to do this is to rent some big laser at some big research lab on to of some mountain. The laser will pulse a bitcoin transaction " to the moon"  , where it is reflected by one of the reflectors left by a moon landing crew from the 60s.   Then it can be decoded to the blockchain....     just so someone can say " bitcoins , to the moon..".

The US dollar , in theory, is stable because the supply fluxuates based on demand.  Bitcoins supply is stable/predictable over time so then the value should fluxuate based on the demand..
Look at it like this... 100 years a go , you could go into a shop and buy a really good suit for a 20 dollar gold coin. Today , you can go into a store and buy a really nice suit , with that same 20 dollar gold coin.. ( forget collector value)...nothing has really changed.. gold coin equals a really nice suit. It takes more dollars now to buy that suit because of the supply.
At the moment, bitcoins supply is up and demand is down...  it takes less dollars to buy bitcoins... enjoy that for now... nothing has changed. A bitcoin is still a bitcoin..

The problem most people have is the way you are trying to sell CNC work as hand crafted. Now if you have so many people that want your work then you would not be out the $200 because the next person will take his place... If i found out the house had termites after they said it was inspected you would get your deposit back for sure....
The next thing that looks really scammish is that you wont give him back his $200 dollars....   that will even look worse in my eye.   you havent even started the work yet .. as per him.      so its not any loss to you....
This isn't a witch hunt.  people love your work... but people want honesty the most and as it sits now, your not very honest... and that sits bad with people.... 
People will respect you and your work if you just come clean with the truth..
Trying to hype art for big dollars isnt going to fly... did you really think all people would believe that your work was hand carved with an xacto knife detail that you are portraying... some people like my self that likes the look of cnc engraved work can spot it... 
You would have gotten more work if you was truthful about your cnc work then making up storys and making your self out to be bigger then you really are...

But you are still saying you hand carved the pieces and no laser engraver or cnc drumal was used.  The work that you do looks amazing. No one is disagreeing. But it's the false impression that the work was done over many hours if not days, Hand Carved, from your own creative mind when in fact all it took was 10 minutes on a cnc device and other people's images from the internet.... YES. Each piece was "hand finished" but there really isn't any talent in that.. Yes, wood planks are expensive, and you claim of some elaborate import hoop when in fact the wood can be found on EBay. You should have stated in the begining that they were cnc'd, But greed took over you and you inflated the price with a false story and your method of your work.  This is called THEFT BY DESEPTION with intent to scam people for more money, Mate!  Your elaborate houx is up.

The script contains two components, a signature and a public key. The public key must match the hash given in the script of the redeemed output. The public key is used to verify the redeemers signature, which is the second component. More precisely, the second component is an ECDSA signature over a hash of a simplified version of the transaction. It, combined with the public key, proves the transaction was created by the real owner of the address in question

Ebay search words     Bitcoin and NFC
And they are the stickers I added into my paper wallets.
they have a very limited amount of memory. I just program a URL link to blockchain address page...but you could store 1 private key for 1 bitcoin address.
I haven't found any information on long term storage retention on programmable nfc tags and cards, So only use as a form of backup of private key.
Also all nfc tags are not all compatible with all nfc readers/devices.
Also most nfc reader/writer programs store reads and writes in clipboard...so be careful of that...

All im asking is for you to be honest. Your not some hoytie toytie famous unknown wood carver that's been in hiding for years and now wants to be famous but yet unknown with some black market illegal wood import connections . You put on your pants on, one leg at a time just like me.  By the way you type , you must be from the northeast, probley from the colder half, maybe Maine or Vermont. You burn wood to heat your house which in its self is a lot of work, you go to yard sales and buy used stuff because your not as rich as you say you are. Your older , maybe retired or close to it and wood working is your hobby, your son or grandson might be the one that has the CNC so you can still say you don't own one, you like to be in the woods by your self because you were picked on as a kid.  You were awkward as a kid and didnt have many friends . Your parents were really strict so you learned to lie and hide your shady side. You would lie to cover your tracks so much that it became natural and it doesn't feel right to tell the truth.  Even if you are confronted with the truth you will always lie no matter how far fetched your story is.. You turn the story around so when you are confronted with the lie again, you can lie and say it is a witch hunt and people are out to get you..  You so much want to be like by others, You  tell more stories of your great talents and fame.... but in all actuality your just a scammer , cought in the act and you only defence, because its all you know, is to lie.
I really feel sorry for you. You should seek professional help. Does your wife know she is living with a sociopathic compulsive liar? No she doesnt because your that good at it and that is all you know....  
see you on bitcointalk...
