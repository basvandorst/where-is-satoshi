It's not because some people love their phone, that it's one of the best phones around.
A large part of Apple's way of marketing is not about getting new customers, but about keeping their current customers satisfied with their iDevices so they keep buying Apple: they use version numbers instead of version names, they rarely change the product designs, etc. They want people to be familiar with the brand.
They want people to be constantly flooded by new and improved Apple stuff so they don't bother to look at other brands. Once someone buys an Apple product, they rarely go back. This works really well for Apple and allows them to spend their resources on ads to attract new customers, on software polishing, some power-user targeted stuff (OS X Server, Mac Pro, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, etc).
This way, they can just 'go with the flow' and not spend too much on hardware R&amp;D for example. Sure, if Samsung or Google come up with a new feature that people seem to buy, they'll implement it, but it's not their first priority. People with Apple products are happy because the devices just work. The small amount of iDevices makes compatibility issues almost non-existent and the design never really becomes outdated. They have a large enough market share so that app developers always make their apps compatible with iOS, so with nearly all iDevices.
These are just my observations, and this isn't critique on Apple either. It's a perfect business strategy, but that doesn't make it a fact that Apple devices are some of the *best*, which is also a really subjective word, devices around.
Edit: Sorry for the long post by the way, just wanted to give you another perspective.

I don't want to pointlessly hate on Apple, but that's simply not true.
