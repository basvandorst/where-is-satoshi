You have a good point, its a question alot of us, even the most loyal are asking.  Bitcoin is great, but exchanges require trust, which Satoshi even warned against.  I believe there is one which accepts MoneyPak, it may not be the best exchange fee and rate wise, i don't know, but it is an option.

bitcoin was designed as a proof of concept, the work your computer does is what is supposed to give it value.  If this concept is applied to something like fold at home and you're doing something meaningful with the processing power, thats the kind of thing I feel bitcoin is supposed to be paving the way for.

Just explain to them that your investments were good but that the exchange you were "banking through" became insolvent.
if it really was just $100 and it "lasted" several months they'll probably shrug it off, its far less money than a game console and part of they're agreeing in the first place was probably the fact that they expected it could be a learning experience.

@_date: 2014-02-28 19:02:10
Yes, if there were regulation Gox might not have happened, however, Satoshi's original paper on Bitcoin admits putting trust in strangers to hold your store of value is dangerous and said you should be your own bank.  It sucks that people lost bitcoin in Gox, but if people treated Gox like what it really was, a middleman, instead of like an fdic insured bank, things might not have been such a clusterfuck.

You're right they'll be hard, if not impossible to hold accountable, but you're wrong about what peoples mistake was... Holding bitcoin doesn't mean your fucked, treating an exchange like a bank is the mistake, this time its gox customers who were shit on.  The community just needs to learn and grow.... and not leave they're money sitting out on the table when we know we're keeping shady company.

@_date: 2014-08-20 07:41:45
Good, not perfect, but neither was my idea, using a middle man to hold the bitcoin until the product or service was rendered.  the middle man just becomes additional risk in an environment that lacks trust.
I like your idea.

True, it needs to become stable to be widely adopted as currency.  It currently acts more like a stock in that its highly trade-able for profit and people happen to accept it in some places as payment.
Basically, adoption depends on bitcoin growing up.  You can't trust a currency you can make a profit trading between that currency and another.  I have faith in bitcoin to stabilize, but until then it is not ready to be used as a currency.
Sorry, thats not really a direct answer, but thats my take.

Nobody thinks Gox deserve the bailout as a company, the question is should it be done to help those who lost in MtGox.
If the answer is yes though, the question becomes how, there is no system in place, is it done by a wealthy individual, a group of individuals, another exchange?  And what the fuck is in it for the person(s) providing the bailout?

Uber and Lyft aren't innovation... They pretend to be a tech company but they aren't, and they ignore the laws that apply to taxi companies to protect consumers.  They're just fucking taxi companies with a fancy app for dispatch.
Edit: Ok, so "taxi" is a point of contention, car services then.  The registration and insurance does protect consumers, theres no telling who your Uber/Lyft driver, who did not need to pass a background check or get special insurance is, customers have been attacked with hammers for example.

I would personally split it 50/50 because assuming 3 scenarios, they allow cash withdrawal but not bitcoin, they allow bitcoin withdrawal but not cash or you lose it all, are all equally likely you've given yourself a 2 out of 3 chance of recovering some of your money instead of a 1 out of 3 chance of recovering all of it.
@_date: 2014-02-22 05:43:58
Maybe you can, the question is whether they have the money and or bitcoins to pay people out or not.

The argument between the profit seekers and the bitcoin as religion folks is kinda silly.  The higher the value of a single bitcoin is, with "bitcoin" being what the public see, not its denominations, the less appealing it is to new regular joe users, so its actually better for the cause when its lower.  Of course there are gonna be Wannastreet brokers in the game, humans like it when things look like easy money, so whatever, its not like you have to pity them when they blow it, hell maybe scaring the broker wannabes off will stabilize prices.

*Disclaimer: Just to indulge conspiracy theory;*
I would posit it could also be a social engineering tactic, get those on the fringes like many of us to rally around it, invest heavily in either bitcoin directly or equipment to mine it, then seize as much of it as they can find cause to thus causing economic injury to the people most likely to dissent against the status quo.
Edit: We have no idea who Satoshi Nakamoto is, except that hes likely not Japanese like he implied before going dark.  He could be connected to a bank or intelligence agency.
@_date: 2014-03-12 00:05:10
Not the BEST news, but on the flipside, attempting to regulate bitcoin means they're recognizing as legitimate.
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:01:49
Bitcoin is not about trust, in fact Satoshi is specific in pointing that out in his original paper on the concept.  Exchanges are and will probably remain a weak point, yes obvious scams should be pointed out, but if you're serious about bitcoin the best idea is to get in, get your btc and get out.

@_date: 2014-03-12 04:29:57
You may disagree, but many people believe more government is a problem, not a solution, and consider themselves libertarian.  They would argue as Satoshi stated in his original paper that bitcoin removes trust, and that you handle transactions with that in mind, knowing that once a bitcoin leaves your control, its truely out of your control.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:47:23
Desire for privacy = criminal predisposition.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:41:09
Because governments hate things that allow you privacy and by their very nature try to expand their control, so when something seems to give you a way to evade their control, they attack it.
Edit: Also, its not illegal in the U.S., California actually has a bill calling for its recognition as legal, but a lot of people who either don't understand it, or are banks are against it.  It did kind of grow up on the black market, but it is not in itself bad or immoral, simply private.

If it was lost due to the fact that it was a paper wallet or casascius coin that was damaged in a fire or stolen in a burglary then maybe homeowners/ renters insurance applies but I cannot possibly imagine it helping in this situation.  The cash or coins you had at gox weren't in a form or location you can in any manner argue falls under the protection of homeowners/ renters insurance.

If you meant value there would be a difference, when you say price there's not the same distinction.  The value of the dollar going down could make the price of bitcoin go up without the value of bitcoin moving.  Don't try to be smug without thinking through what you're saying.

Gave my brother some in a paper wallet for his birthday, he already uses bitcoin though so that doesn't really add to this conversation.

hmm i'm not in the market but 5k for a 99 f-250's not bad, if I weren't happy with my jetta...
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:09:51
The point isn't profit.  If it were there are obviously better ways, I know that.

I was having errors on Bitcoin Qt too, I believe it was something along the lines of "block data corrupt" I setup a blockchain wallet that i'm going to be moving everything to after Qt gets running again and I can move my btc's

if you go to the "receive coins" tab it should show and let you copy your address to give to someone.
@_date: 2013-05-10 06:14:02
its not a huge rip if you do volume, but I feel like I just pissed a dollar away to give you 50 cents &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2013-04-22 01:14:52
maybe biased, but not wrong.  I left gox for vircurex
@_date: 2013-04-21 04:26:41
I'm sorry.  In my own experience family can be worse to you than anyone...  Its not always possible to make amends, but its always worth trying (just not at the expense of becoming a doormat) 
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:54:12
Thanks, now that thats out of the way, got anything constructive to say or are you just going to jerk off with righteous indignation.
@_date: 2013-05-10 05:31:01
Weird... I don't like doing the sponsor/ pay for laps thing, but I don't mind giving sometimes.  I haven't got much bitcoin, but i'll kick some your way. 
Edit:  How do I send from Vircurex?  Is it withdraw?  They have a .01 withdrawal fee and I have .0148 bitcoin on there...
@_date: 2013-04-20 19:45:54
hmm, doesn't feel like it.  i'm on board for the ride either way.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:28:01
Wouldn't it be something to say Satoshi Nakamoto (2014 Nobel in Economics)

The goal isn't for a massive boost, I'm not trying to push for profit on a machine like this.  I want to achieve just enough performance increase to be noticeable more as a learning experience than anything.  I know the Retina run significantly harder than the non Retina right out of the box, both running 650ms
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:21:41
cool, i'll save this thread incase I have trouble with vircurex.  I don't anticipate any but if I move again I might as well help a fellow redditor out.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:02:41
you could try pooled mining
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:06:37
these, negative news coverage and other issues seem manufactured to scare people off of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:42:17
This, I had over $2000 in records, including imports and limited pressings stolen back when I was a dj when I was younger, cops didn't give a single fuck, they left me a form with a second carbon copy to to fill out and bring back to the station.  They told me unless they came across it incidentally in the investigation of another crime I was probably s.o.l.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:44:34
If you're down to figure out how to mine, minepooling is a good way to go know some people don't like deepbit.net but im having luck with them.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:30:21
not bad results for that, what pool are you in?
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:22:27
they're moving to a new host because the real ip was discovered and ddos'd they should be back by the end of the day.
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:47:53
you using something like bitminter?  i just send them to vircurex and swap them for bitcoins.
2 cryptocurrencies, ain't nobody got time for that.
@_date: 2013-05-10 05:43:37
Ih, i think it ended up being something like 54 cents... I feel kinda bad.
@_date: 2013-04-22 01:26:27
bout a week, not long.   I like it, but then I haven't tried campbx, so I don't know how those 2 compare.
@_date: 2013-04-25 07:03:13
Oh trust me, I don't live under that delusion (castle rock vs. gonzales).  I just figured since they showed up they could have at least pretended to look at the scene.
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:28:08
thank you, i'll consider you if my jetta craps out.
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:35:44
I switched to blockchain after bullshit with bitcoinqt, something about a corrupt database, this is ricoculous.
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:35:22
Lame attempt, eat a dick.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:27:22
Yeah, I got mine through my school, and now that i'm done i wanted to play with it a bit, I could bootcamp, it would serve the dual purpose of a way to throw on some games without running wineskin.
@_date: 2013-05-11 16:35:04
uhhh... it is literally called "junk coin" if you expect it to become of some use, I think you're at the butt end of a bad joke.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:08:52
We could establish motive for most banks and some governments that have spoken out negatively about bitcoin, but honestly who knows.  Best I have is the likely "why", which would be to spook potential investors/ believers in the new currency by smearing its image as vulnerable. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:42:18
If zuckerberg is informed regarding bitcoin and sees it as profitable enough to be worth the while, it could.  I wouldn't necessarily use it myself but social media is huge.
