Unix: 1 tool, 1 well-defined job. I've been using GPG for the past 10 years. 
Don't reinvent the wheel is another motto, especially if you replace it with a poor alternative like bitcoins that could crash any day.
Edit: GPG also works if disconnected, bitcoins can't do this.

If you mean the GPG used for encryption, you have no idea what you're talking about. If not, sorry...
For those who downvoted, please explain where I am wrong, I'll be happy to post the mathematical explanation. TL;DR: crypto-morons who never studied crypto try to explain and use crypto, it's dangerous...

There are no contracts with GPG, only data that is either signed or encrypted. Also what kind of algorithms can bitcoins use that GPG doesn't have?
TL;DR: 2 different things for different purpose.

That's like saying you should replace numbers, public keys or SSL with bitcoin since it does almost those things. I studied crypto and don't understand what the OP is talking about.
Edit: the purpose of GPG is encryption. If the OP mentions it, it means encryption or signing.
Analogy: the Internet should be replaced by email since email does more than the the Internet. With email you can share files, and send messages, we don't need the Internet anymore.

I hope you're not serious about having so much cash in bitcoins.

So, what would you require? What do you need? I'm interested in this bitcoin thing but I don't want to spend money on it or convert it to real money, just earn a bit. I'm a programmer that worked on everything if that helps, do you have a project in mind?
