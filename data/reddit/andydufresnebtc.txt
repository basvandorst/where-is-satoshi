do not buy alt coins. have an appreciation that this is a science that is rooted in reality and its physical limitations. When you think out an alt coin's technical roadmap, do not skip any issues or problems that you might think or see, by an answering yourself with the logic of someone else will solve it or I do not understand the issue and there must be someone else out there who can answer it.

Bitcoin like all great technology has no ideology or politics or religion. Bitcoin is and as long as it survives it will not have an ideology. We humans put labels on things. Andreas Pump and Dumb a Lot is not a good signal of where things are in Bitcoin. He looks to other people to make his statements and he waits for the argument to be sufficiently de-risked before voicing an opinion. he is a lagging indicator. And now he makes a dumb ideological statement about Bitcoin. People move on, this is dumb and not worth anyones time.

anyone that thinks analysts are worth shit are so dumb. anyone who has any understanding of the analyst industry will tell you the job is one where you only need to be right 51% of the time. no geniuses here. this analyst in particular is one that has found a niche audience that believe in the forever coming collapse of the American economy. if you actually read the article it indicates that this analyst is currently the most bearish strategist on wall street. this is no different then these mega dumb gold guys who do the same thing with gold price predictions. we must come to grips with that there will always be a group of people who believe the collapse is here and since the universe always has an equal and opposite reaction, scammers prey on this ideology.
