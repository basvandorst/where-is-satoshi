Seriously, if my money didn't depreciate and I had a way of backing it up I wouldn't use banks either. I don't get anyone would use exchanges to store bitcoins.

It's a downside of bitcoin in return for the pros. Everyone has to deal with it or we might as well go paypal/fiat.

Your post says:


Yea, I'm agreeing with you with the new gox thing. Maybe you should read my post.

Who's to say there won't be a new gox? Or hell, any of the current exchanges could be doing this right now, except making it less obvious.

It's an unregulated market. Wasn't this what everyone wanted with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:16:49
... regulating the market of bitcoin IS regulating bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:01:01
Yes but the regulations aren't legally enforced.

You are regulating an entity whose main role is to exchange the currency. I think that is basically regulating the currency itself?
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:26:24
who regulates it? mtgox? coinbase? government?

Fraud is explicitly illegal in all forms. Insider trading isn't illegal for bitcoins.

Because as more people adopt bitcoin, people who have bitcoin get rich.
