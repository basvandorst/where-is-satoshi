what is there to get, exactly? 
nothing in your comment explained how the blockchain is used in this process or how it's significant, let alone significant enough to justify the huge overhead (hundreds of thousands of lines of code, 80gb of blockchain data) mentions in the root comment of this thread.
tbh, what you're describing seems like one of *those ideas*, you know, like "let's make a webpage that connects all your social network accounts on one page!". where's the value in that? and more importantly, why is the bitcoin blockchain relevant here? 
@_date: 2016-08-19 20:40:38


this is demonstrably false; either you are being ignorant or disingenuous. the CPU time it takes to process an extra transaction's signature is not negligible in the context of the network as a whole. adding a few bytes of metadata to an OP_RETURN transaction that already necessarily exists does not equate to the same amount of spam as extra transactions within a block.
in terms of scalability, you are wrong.
edit: 


adhering to the rules of a protocol but actually being junk data instead of relevant data is the definition of spam, in other words, noise.

from where i'm standing, everyone who lost money on bitfinex ignored all bitcoiner warnings and deposited their funds on a web-wallet which "went down", "got hacked", or was otherwise "robbed"

i'm not saying your conclusion was *wrong*, i'm saying it doesn't match the premise in your title. premise: "Latest Bitcoin Hack Proves 'Buyer Beware' Is Flawed Defense" doesn't match the conclusion "industry needs to set better standards". because in an environment where the industry sets the standards high enough, regulation isn't needed, as long as consumers are diligent. on the other hand, the conclusion that follows from "buyer beware is flawed" is "regulations need to be stepped up". 
the assumption i'm making is this: saying "buyer beware doesn't work" implies we need regulations to replace the need for consumers to do their own research, as regulations will set some lower bounds of consumer-protection standards that companies need to match, alleviating users from the burden of doing research in a field they don't have specialized knowledge in. you even provided evidence for this conclusion in your article: users are generally not responsible for their own keys.
but if your conclusion was: "bitcoin industry needs better consumer protection standards". (which i agree with; it's demonstratibly true), you need to realize that conclusion doesn't match the title of the article at all, unless you are also calling for stricter regulations as well.
your premise and some of your evidence doesn't apply to that argument, it applies to the "we need more regulations" argument.
the statements "buyer beware works for bitcoin companies" and "industry standards need to be better" are not mutually exclusive!
overall, the article was factually correct and makes good points, but the evidence and main points are scattered and don't follow a cohesive logical structure.

This is good but it's missing a few points. I love LN and the team and the tech but LN will primarily be used for b2b transfers (mostly between the dark blue hubs seen in this infographic). It is not going to be good for end-users and everyone who has done any research into the topic knows it. 
"No locking-up of funds" is stretching the truth. Users will necessarily be forced to fund channels between themselves and nodes that have weak connectivity to the network unless they only shop at a place represented by a dark blue node in the center of this image.
Given the following facts, how can users possibly know which nodes to connect to and which channels to fund?
1. Users cannot predict which of their connected nodes' channels will be funded.
2. Users cannot predict which routes will have capacity because capacity is constantly being used-up by other connected nodes routing through the network.
3. Users who fund too little or too much in their channels will feel penalized because they'll have to pay more network fees. This negative feedback is frustrating, inconsistent, and confusing.

@_date: 2018-01-03 15:37:02
This thread is full of re-posted quotes that make absolutely no sense in this context.
Exactly how is the damage going to be "routed around" in this case? If your Bitcoin are stuck in a channel between your node and a DDOS'd node you can't "route around" that problem -- your money is literally frozen until that service is unstuck.
Also, you can't "route around" the problem of high network fees. Centralization is a real problem.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:35:37
i don't see how the premise of your argument matches the conclusion at all.
you're making a huge logical leap from "regulators need to be smarter" all the way to "more regulation is needed". but *why* are those regulations needed in the first place?
the fact remains that we do not need regulations for *caveat emptor* to be effective -- only transparency and best practices are needed.
in this case regulation caused bitfinex to take a path-of-least-resistence, somewhere between "a weird hackish way to stay compliant" and "this is clearly an insecure implementation that fits this regulatory loophole". obviously the regulators need to understand technology better if they are to meddle in tech-based businesses and inadvertently incentivize loophole situations that create points of failure. or they should just go away entirely and let individuals invest their money the way they see fit.
do you think the theft would have been as large of an amount if bitfinex had openly admitted large funds were not kept in cold storage? IMO, if i had $10million worth of BTC in bitfinex i would *at least* ask if they had some % of my funds in cold storage, and if they weren't i'd pull out immediately.

isn't the miner centralization issue with litecoin far worse? pretty much only antminer produces litecoin asics and there are fewer of them dispersed around the world


i don't think that it's irreplaceable, but it's certainly unlikely for bitcoin to be replaced, considering the network effect and developer stronghold bitcoin has. i think it's foolish to move everything over to litecoin because it has 4x linear scaling. that's such a huge shift for a temporary gain in efficiency. then again, the OP i'm responding to was asking about only stripe moving to accept litecoin, which is definitely a possibility but i doubt they'd have many users


if the devs don't have Litecoin and they have a stockpile of Bitcoin they'll 100% stay with bitcoin unless literally 95%+ of users switch which is unrealistic

I don't find those papers to have any scientific evidence that RAM is a bottleneck because of block size. RAM is a bottleneck in proportion to the unspent output set which is mostly independent of block size. UTXO set consuming lots of RAM is also mitigated by various solutions that are trivial to implement that would not affect block size. 
By the way, what is your proposed scaling solution if 4MB blocks are the maximum? Decreasing block time to 2-5 minutes? We can only see a small increase from this solution and it's a bad idea for many other reasons.

How will it "eventually be built directly into wallets and it would be just as if you were using bitcoin today"? My wallet is going to automatically decide which channels I am funding?
Here's a scenario: I have 0.3 BTC and I want to put it all on LN to spend it faster without fees. How do I decide which channels I want to lock up my funds with? How do I decide what amount of funds I lock up in each channel? Even if I have some idea of how much capacity a node has between other nodes right now, I have no idea how that capacity will change within the upcoming days or even hours. Someone else on the network could use up all the capacity and I'm stuck with (let's say) 0.2 BTC locked up in a channel between me and another node that I might not ever end up sending 0.2 BTC.

Shkreli once doxxed a prank caller on stream, found his facebook, found his MOM on facebook, and told the kid he would use his millions to seduce his mother for the sole purpose of becoming the kid's step-father so he could harshly discipline him then leave his mother and break her heart. Savage doesn't even begin to describe it

The network can only find a route if there is capacity between my node and the node I want to send to. That's what a route is: a possible connection between my node and another node through the network such that every hop has enough capacity to send my funds to my destination. What happens if there isn't enough capacity or there is no route? My funds are stuck, correct? How do I as a user decide which channels to fund given this risk? Are we expecting users to figure this out and deal with it themselves?

what exactly does the minimum fee limit have to do with out of control fees when blocks are full? when blocks are full the fee market causes crazy $29 fees like we've seen in bitcoin. when blocks are not full the fees are already low. if LTC blocks were full it would have the same exact problem as bitcoin. lowering the minimum fee amount does not solve this problem. this is the type of nonsense that is used to trick 99% of people who don't know any better into believing something is true when in reality it is not.
only LN or sidehcains can scale transactions, and if that's the case, why would you use the shitty derivative of BTC when the core devs are shipping the original code on bitcoin?

If I have funds in the blockchain I can spend them anywhere. If I have funds in a channel I can only spend to people who:
1. Also have LN
2. Are connected by a route to a channel I have already funded
You said:


Keep in mind that LN requires you have bitcoin but bitcoin doesn't require you have LN, therefore, LN users are necessarily a subset of bitcoin users. It is provably incorrect to say **everywhere**. In addition, a route is defined as a path through the network with enough capacity. Even if there is a route to my destination, which might not be the case, what if there isn't enough capacity? 
This is the major issue here for users. How does a user decide how much of their Bitcoin to fund in a channel? Which channels should they fund and why? How do they decide how much to fund one channel vs another? How can users be expected to know how to make these decisions?

what the actual fuck? the only terrible idea proposed here is the notion that merchants should *NOT* wait for confirmations. are you out of your mind? have you even read the satoshi whitepaper?
you can't just ignore the problem and pretend it doesn't exist. miners have the power to replace transactions at will. why would you even begin to assume they will always play nice when it is directly in their own interest to do the exact opposite?
the solution is to have all miners adhere to one transparent standard that is incentive aligned, which is exactly what this push to implement RBF is trying to achieve.

first of all, there is no "the mempool", everyone has their own individual mempool and it would be impossible to tell if transaction fees were paid appropriately.
also, it costs very little to spam the mempool with 20mb of junk data, why would miners ever let the mempool become less than 100% full?

eth devs are obviously influenced by money at this point, choosing to go directly against their censorship-resistant claims (from the main page of ethereum.org) by censoring the transactions of this "thief". all to appease a bunch of investors who put $160 million into a system that promised to be governed "autonomously", rules etched in stone by code, free from the outside control of humans. HOW IRONIC!
i've forever lost the respect of the eth community and eth devs who are supporting the decision to hard-fork code based on an isolated case of what they perceive as a theft. this is textbook censorship
**that isn't the blockchain i signed up for**. i wouldn't even call it a blockchain, as i define blockchain as an *unchangeable proof of work*.
it's as if bitcoin devs proposed increasing the coin cap to 42 million BTC... that's not the bitcoin i know and love.

why simply bet against the real estate bubble and its creditors when you can capitalize 100 fold on the outcome of that bubble's burst? 
satoshi saw the real estate crash coming from a mile away, and instead of settling on a short-term fortune like all the rest, they made a bigger bet on what would happen after the inevitable market crash. 
they wanted something that would guarantee them hundreds of billions if things panned out as expected.
so they created bitcoin, and it's all coming to fruition now.

Scarcity is a relative thing. If something is scarce in relation to its demand the price goes up. 
Your comment is comparing the most usual accounting unit for bitcoin (1BTC) and the most usual account unit for gold (1 ounce of gold). They are arbitrary units of account that don't take into account scarcity in relation to demand. There are fewer bitcoins than ounces of gold but there's also less demand for bitcoins. If bitcoin suddenly gained the same demand as gold, the price would go up by thousands of percent.

more than a few good bitcoin exchanges would be regulated out of existence thanks to prohibitive laws
more than a few million people would have their private information compromised by laws that require these entities to keep customers' data on hand, not to mention the additional incentive for hackers to breach the exchange thanks to sensitive information being held in their database.
it's hard for indoctrinated people to understand how backwards the thinking is behind this type of regulation. imagine for a minute there existed a 1st world country close to the united states that had laws friendly to bitcoin exchanges, or exchanges there are explicitly  unrestricted by the law. let's say a group of well-known businesspeople and developers, say executives of trusted american companies like yahoo and pepsi, went to that country and started an exchange with some talent they acquired from google and facebook and MIT. would you trust that exchange more or less than an exchange set up by some random people in new york who happen to have a bit license?

Path for network adoption for LN:
1. LN 1.0 stable is released some time in the next few years.
2. People learn they need to lock up funds into channels before they are able to spend anything. Locking up funds in the wrong channel means they can't spend at certain merchants. Locking up funds in the right channel requires unavoidable effort and research. Worst case scenario: you can't reliably determine whether or not a route exists so you decide to go to spend your BTC at a merchant who doesn't have an existing route to your wallet. You end up paying with VISA instead and you have Bitcoins locked up in a channel you don't want to use anywhere else.
3. LN fails to gain adoption because these problems are unavoidable and we go back to the drawing board. Maybe layer 1 solutions where it always works every time and doesn't introduce a system making use of miners' work for security but not paying them at all for it.

I don't see how remembering either of those numbers is easier. 
On the other hand, everyone knows that Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places, which makes it pretty easy to figure out how many satoshis is in a bitcoin in case you forget. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:13:26
This is much better than bits imo. "Bits" is absurd because no one will ever remember how many bits are in a bitcoin and it sounds dumb. Bits also has the problem of being outscaled quickly if the Bitcoin price goes where we think it will. Might as well switch to satoshis now; everyone already values their altcoins and estimates fees in satoshis. It's very natural for bitcoin users to understand satoshis.
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:44:41


This is exactly my point.
People value altcoins in terms of satoshis and not fractions of a bitcoin on exchanges. An example:
I would bet that very few TRON holders can tell you off the top of their head that 1 TRON = 0.000005 BTC and fewer people would know that 1 TRON = 5 bits. but everyone sees that it's worth 0.00000500 BTC which they then remember implicitly: it's worth 500 satoshis.
Satoshis is _already_ the consensus, and it's _already_ confusing enough that bitcoin is divisible by 8 decimal places, why confuse it even more with another denomination that people will need to remember and could conflate with satoshis?
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:55:44
The early Internet and its nay-sayers would be a good comparison if:
1. Phone lines were single-directional and
2. You needed to know where to lock up funds in which channel routed to another node before sending it traffic.
It's not a good comparison because phone lines were big enough to carry bandwidth for websites and general browsing, and they were all accessible on-demand as long as you paid a small fee to the ISP/phone carrier for general usage. That isn't the case with LN: if a route exists but there's no funds locked up in a channel in the direction you need, you simply can't use it until you or someone else funds it.

caller 2 completely fails because Ver has never backed up Wright's claims of being involved in the group of people known as satoshi nakamoto. it's doubtful that Wright was involved but the fact of the matter is he may have known about it, learned about it, or had gained access to some data that emboldened him to make that claim. as of right now we can't disprove it.

Who exactly is in consensus around using the bits convention?
Every exchange already uses satoshis to value things. Most people know that their altcoins are worth 20k satoshis, 300k satoshis, etc. Currently, zero exchanges have adopted bits, because that would be incredibly confusing. LN uses satoshis to value fees. There is more consensus among using satoshis than there is using bits.

@_date: 2015-10-07 04:04:23


every database can be slightly modified to fit this criteria
the blockchain is a true innovation
besides achieving consensus through a decentralized p2p mechanism (already explained in my comment above) it also has fungability of its tokens and the potential for those tokens to represent _something of value_, giving the holder of those private keys the ability to transact that value without a centralized authority to prevent that transaction
without that specific use-case you essentially have a regular old database with an open read FFI and maybe some cryptography, all of which has been around for 30+ years

if the core devs write some code and ask users / exchanges to upgrade but they don't, why does it matter if a dozen or so random dudes are using software that is incompatible with 99.9% of the rest of the network?
in the end it is the users, exchanges, and merchants who choose whether or not segwit will activate

Yes. I've dressed up in enough suits and attended enough  conferences with companies touting "Permissioned Distributed Ledger" technology, and all of them are completely full of shit.
Just because a company has a name and is recognizable doesn't mean they're always going to spend money on something that will work or makes sense.

whoever wrote this has no idea how bitcoin works
at the protocol level:
* transaction priority factors in coin age 
* you can bundle together inputs/outputs to make spending those coins feasible
at a practical level:
* in a negotiation you may be able to use the transaction fee as a bargaining chip (i'll accept the deal if you cover the BTC transaction fee for me)
* the more BTC increases in value, the less of a problem this becomes

um, i think all blockchains are great and there are many of them. probably the 2nd best example is namecoin or primecoin, maybe ethereum. 
if i type mysql in my console it doesn't open up a blockchain. it opens up a database. that is because mysql is not actually a blockchain. it is by definition a relational database.


no, i'm talking about the meaning of the word, as in the definition you'd find in a dictionary or reference manual. because, you know, words have meanings and stuff. 
i'm glad you can find entertainment in thinking up imaginary anthropomorphic blockchains! i'm happy to argue my point about the word blockchain necessitating distributed/decentralized architecture, because that's what it means. 
it's not even a philosophical or political or emotional position that i have; we already have technical definitions for MVCC databases and cryptography. if NASDAQ is creating an MVCC schema in a database with cryptography, they should just call it that instead of trying to hype up their tech with a buzz word that isn't applicable. 
now, if they're taking the technical blueprint of the blockchain, but creating it without any sort of token or proof-of-work, they will fail. simply put an SQL database is more efficient for that type of work.
@_date: 2015-10-27 20:36:10
wow thanks for demystifying that for me!
now please explain how consensus will work in this system and how it's an improvement over any of the technology we have had (cryptology, SQL databases) for the past 30 years. i'll give you a small hint: there is no fucking improvement or difference whatsoever, and if they aren't using the Bitcoin or another decentralized currency's blockchain, there is no reason to use anything other than SQL + crypto.
you can't just slap the word "blockchain" on an amorphous blob and hope people buy it. at some point people are going to realize that you're lying to them.

this isn't funny nor is it clever, and it makes little to no sense
the important part of the free software / free information movement is the dichotomy between public and private information. of course identity and private keys should be private, as there could be no ownership of property without a way to uniquely authenticate the entity's ownership of said property.

@_date: 2015-10-27 20:13:55
because this makes no fucking sense. what is the consensus mechanism? how is a private blockchain different than an SQL database with cryptography, which has existed for 30+ years by the way, and is way more efficient than the structure of the blockchain.
the blockchain was designed to meet the needs of a decentralized system, a centralized blockchain makes no sense

i had thought of the multisig example after writing my post, but wasn't sure if that analogy was applicable to this situation. i'm glad to have it confirmed - thank you for helping me understand this better!!
btw, just a suggestion, but an FAQ that answers these basic questions should be pinned to this sub for the next month or two. it's hard to find any info on what regular bitcoin users need to know about the segwit upgrade.
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:07:02
well, then in this context, you are 100% correct
however, a normal SQL database will outperform any type of blockchain system
so why are they calling it a blockchain?
@_date: 2015-10-27 20:55:33
NASDAQ isn't a company that's going to buy this technology, they're the company that's going to invest millions in it and try to sell it and probably fail. again, just because someone invests resources to make something doesn't mean people will actually buy/use it
i'm not making an argument that bitcoin is adding value to the "average consumer's life", (as if i should give a shit about that in any way whatsoever), i'm making the argument that blockchain technology is not the right way to describe adding crypto to a SQL database. it's a bastardization of the concept of a decentralized marketplace and it's insulting to the innovation of the blockchain

maybe i misunderstood what a hard fork means.
from my understanding, a soft fork means old nodes don't have to upgrade and won't be affected by nodes that upgrade. if i have to upgrade in order to continue using bitcoin as usual then is that really considered a soft fork? where does the line between soft and hard fork lie?

they're not using the blockchain. it's not identical technology if it's not even the same technology. 
headline: blockchain technology
reality: SQL database with crypto 
lol, emotional. let me describe it in another way that uses less colorful language: this shit hurts (wait i'm sorry, companies can't be hurt, they aren't sentient right?) the blockchain technology companies who are actually using the blockchain in a way that is meaningful to the word blockchain. it's parasitic latching on to the hype when there is no meaningful connection between what they're doing and what *actual* blockchain technolgy companies are doing.
i don't even know why i'm dignifying your critique of my writing with a response, but concepts can be "insulted" and companies can be "hurt". you could say that uber was "hurt" by lawsuits and legislation. uber is not a sentient being, it does not feel pain. i understand that, and hopefully you do too.

but seriously, blockchain technology is applicable in very specific situations. what they're doing doesn't require a blockchain. they shouldn't be calling it "blockchain technology".
by every benchmark imaginable a regular SQL database is better suited for this type of work.

what does "capacity" mean in this context? is it bandwidth or on-disk storage capacity?
how does segwit increase capacity by double? can't you prune the entire block if you want to run a pruning node? why does pruning just the witness part of a transaction have any significance if you could prune the whole thing to begin with?
been out of the loop for a while and trying to understand. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 21:31:10
that makes sense, so all segwit nodes will communicate with each other and send each other the segwit data, and nodes that don't have the segwit code will see the "anyone can spend" transactions (which i'm assuming will be impossible to spend based on the way the script is written).

good satire writers understand both sides of the issue and their work reflects that (see: south park).
this comic illustrates little to no understanding of the bitcoin/free software movement
information being free does not mean you can't charge for the service of bringing a newspaper to a convenient place, i.e., a street corner. it's free as in freedom, not free as in "free beer". 
the title "live free or buy" literally means nothing. it's not clever just because the word "buy" rhymes with "die"... 
you don't need a $2,000 computer to access the internet... i don't understand, why there is a beating-a-dead-horse joke about comcast in here?... why would a bitcoin supporter ever be against people supporting content creators / their families... i already covered the private/public information thing above...

i had to read this a few times to understand it, so let me make sure i am clear on this:
segwit makes a change such that witness data is not counted against the 1mb block size limit. this makes segwit a hard-fork (as nodes and clients rejecting 1mb+ blocks will not accept any segwit blocks with a size greater than 1mb). 
@_date: 2017-07-09 21:57:24
if you have a segwit address and i don't, you can't transact with me. i'm not understanding how this is considered a soft fork if i am forced to upgrade. never in the history of bitcoin, other than during a hard fork, did i have to upgrade my software to be able to transact with someone else on the network.

There is conflicting information on how to send money to your Mt.Gox account using bitinstant on your website. In the FAQ it says to use your Merchant ID (M12345678X for example) but on the "deposit money" section it says to use your login name (the account name you use to log in to the site). Which is correct? Why is there conflicting information on different parts of the website? Also, on bitinstant it says to use the M12345678X address. 
"IMPORTANT: If Bitinstant sends you the funds to the wrong account, the transaction is considered final and Mt.Gox will not be able to do anything to recover the funds." Is Mt.Gox going to just keep my money if I happen to put in the wrong number in that box, regardless of the fact that I followed the instructions on the Mt.Gox website?
