Hahaha, that's a good analogy. Though, here in China, they're probably playing some other IAP-ridden monstrosity of a game.
You're right about the fee structure, transparency, platform for creativity, etc. 
A related analogy: bitcoin now is basic survival mode of minecraft, where the potential of the blockchain is creative mode.

Thank you for replying, even though your post is spammy and has nothing to do with my topic!
In other news, your layout looks exactly like those sites where you can buy MMO money ..... except without the bulk discount.
You should also offer 5K DPS one-handers, just to confuse people.

Thanks! Should be interesting. 
Most students just want to know "is it going to go up? can I get rich? etc" which I think misses the most useful parts of the conversation. 
Bitcoin is an especially hot topic here in China due to the extreme difficulty in getting money in and out of the country. Really, really painful, especially for larger (&gt;US$10k) amounts.

Thanks! Yes, it is very very related to The Elements -- it's the direct inspiration and using the same music.

That's actually a really good idea. The problem is the sync time -- if they all download the client, it'll take ~3 hours for the network to sync. 
Alternatively, I can ask them all to download and sync the client before class, meaning, for a class of 50 or so, 5 or 6 of them will actually do it. 
Then, at the beginning of class, I'll start a transfer, and then ask them to speak up once it shows as pending and then cleared to demonstrate confirmation times and process.

I'll check it out! 
Though I kind of like having them actually sync the wallet, since the data download shows very clearly how each node has the full blockchain (and that this isn't a small amount of data).

One of the social impacts I want to talk about is ultra-small transactions and tip culture. Have to practice what I preach!

Thank you very much! I'll check them both out now.

You have to admit the resemblance to MMO gold sites is uncanny....

You're referring to the Moon tips? 
I was planning to use dogecoin tips but never got the tipbot set up. I sent a registration request a hour+ ago but haven't received a response. I then tried the mooncoin tip bot (happened to have some lying around), and the bot worked right away. So I'm guessing the dogecoin tip bot is being slow for some reason. 
Then again dogecoin is also an alt coin.....

And in case you're wondering, it took WAY too long to make =) 
It's based off of Tom Lehrer's "The Elements". Turns out it is very hard to sing / talk that fast and make yourself understood!

Thanks for the suggestion! 
I have a tangential relationship to some of his investors, so perhaps he can make a guest appearance =)

The spelling was very close! Usually the pinyin spelling is "zai jian" 
I'm in the minority of people who are excited to see Bitcoin prices stabilize -- I think a huge increase in price would cause an enormous amount of disruption.

Ouch. Expensive mistake =)
