Gotcha!  I too was shocked when my Mother asked me about crypto.  Hah!  Most of my friends aren't technical but each one has texted me over the past few months "hey is too late to get into crypto?" and each one of them has picked up some (I didn't tell them to cause I don't want that on my conscious.)

Just want to make sure I understand you, he cost basis is 0 if they're forked but normally if you buy BCH and then trade for BTC your cost basis is what you paid right?  It's not always 0?

I just thought it was cool to see it in the wild.  It caught me off guard and made me do a double-take.

Everyone says to only buy directly from manufacturer to be safe.  I ordered a Nano S from Ledger directly, will be here about 12 days after ordering.
