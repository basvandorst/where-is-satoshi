This is a good idea!  A few features that might be helpful:
* Fees (As you mentioned)
* Documents required (Driver's license, address verification, etc.)
* Estimated time, start to finish
* Average lag
* Average spread (calculated against the most common exchange, currently Mt. Gox)
To my knowledge, the closest thing that exists is this [webpage](

I'm trying to offload fiat in return for a bitcoin miner.
Should we  also downvote anyone trying to convert USD to BTC at an exchange?

Maybe you are on a limited data plan and/or want higher speeds.

I would be in for this, but I think to get an order in with an ASIC manufacturer we would need a significant amount of capital.  Possibly $1m+
Also, we should explore additional options before deciding on a crowd funding platform.
Can anyone do an estimation of costs for a project like this?

Building your own is very different from buying them.  Building your own entails design, manufacture, etc. which is a big investment in time.
I image that anyone who follows ASICMiner's plan (but at a larger scale) could perform an attack but they would have to have investments in the old monetary system that outweigh the benefits of having such a huge hash rate.

That would be a great service, but I think you would still need to hire claims investigators to secure the system against fraud.

I have C++, C JavaScript, and Lua knowledge as well as a good understanding of data structures.  My background is in programming computer games and a bit of webdev but I'd like to start contributing to bitcoin related projects.

I wonder how it authenticates users and devices.  Can you pay once and connect multiple devices?  Also, can you spoof your MAC to impersonate a device which is already authenticated?

We either need a self-posts only subreddit or one that is strictly moderated.

I've purchased a few shares of the ones that I feel have solid business plans.  I haven't invested a large amount yet because I'm skeptical of btct.co and bitfunder having a secure and lasting presence in the bitcoin economy.
Make sure you read up on P/E and PEG ratios before you buy a large amount of shares.  These are the most common ways to assess the value of a dividend-paying stock.

I had this same idea months ago and bought the same printer for my RPi.  Then someone brought up the thermal paper's lifetime and I gave up.  However, I'm glad that you stuck with it and made it into a product!
Any idea when we can get the source?  I've got the parts and might as well toss them together if you've got some slick python running everything.

Where is a good place to start learning "how Bitcoin works, i.e. anatomy of transaction, script etc."?
Should I just read the whitepaper?  I'm fairly good at absorbing information just from reading but if there is a suggested learning tool for it then that would be even better.
Of course I'd love bounties but just getting to work on bitcoin or a related project would be pretty damn cool.
Bounties would be especially helpful to me because I don't like the idea of spending USD on bitcoin.  I'd much rather buy mining hardware or do something to earn some BTC.  I should add that I would be willing to work on the "boring parts" if it means I get some of that sweet sweet BTC.

Even though we don't know if the coins are changing hands this is still a positive indicator that the underlying protocol can handle this volume.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:01:02


Is this true?  It sounds false, but I didn't see a source which confirmed it either way.
@_date: 2013-05-04 17:09:27
The price is only *absurd if you don't understand basic economics.
The supply of ASIC miners is very low and the demand is very high therefore the price is high.
You must also understand that a lot of brainpower and time went into the development of this device and without a significant return on that investment the developers have no incentive to produce the device in the first place.

Saying that bitcoin was hacked because one exchange was the victim of a DDoS attack is the same as saying that USD was hacked because someone attempted a DDoS attack against a foreign currency exchange.

TL;DR:  The market will determine if this is a good price point.


Yeah, basically; most people aren't good at accurate value assessments.  I don't know why.


Yes, and this makes even less sense, because the price is in BTC, not USD, so the exchange rate wouldn't matter vs. holding the BTC.


And my point is that buyers don't understand simple economics or more accurately, investments.  People will buy them regardless of ROI and they probably know that, hence the price.
As for why people buy them when there is such shitty ROI, I cannot help you there.  My guess is that people are dumb and get caught up in the hype.  Again, some people don't understand difficulty increases and how that affects return over time.


Yes but people are too dumb to realize this.  The customer will purchase based on perceived value, not actual value.  ASIC's are perceived to be exceptional and have a large amount of hype surrounding them, making their perceived value very high.
