The point of a hardware wallet is that it only provides signed txn data in its broadcast, and cannot share keys by design 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:57:05
If two people have the same address, then they have the same private keys and they both can access the coins.  That is how it works.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:44:01
Yes, but the probability of it actually happening is practically zero.  
Edit:per below 
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:05:16
The oracle is providing a private key that collapses the channel, they are not directly involved in the txn.  Anyone can be the oracle, and doesn't need to know the two parties with an open contract, or that a contract even exists 
It requires Schnorr, or Schnorr "like" signatures that reverse the traditional way the math is used.
I can't do the video justice, go find some bandwidth, it's worth it.

Yes both ledger and Trezor support multiple currencies, but you are limited on the ledger as to how many you can keep active on a single device. Because you have your seed you can always add or remove the apps, but typically you can run 3 to 4 currencies on the hardware concurrently.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:57:09
It's fine.  What wallet do you use?
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:48:45
But it seems "descreet log contracts" are better, and they don't even need Segwit to work.  LN 2.0, by the guy who created LN.

What is the file name?

Based on this, maybe you don't have change and are unable to use this feature. In that case you just have to wait or contact the recipient of these funds and have them do the child transaction.
Don't worry about the donation.

Please just watch the video. I can guarantee you you are missing a critical **new** point that Tadge explains, but yes you are correct about legacy understanding.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:55:57
That seems very arbitrary, is there a technical reason?

@_date: 2017-08-25 09:17:18
You don't have to use an oracle, that is just one example of how a contract can work.  
Segwit is **not** required to create a LN payment channel.
The benefit of this are payment channels that don't have to constantly monitor the blockchain to keep the other party honest.
I'll see if I can find the MIT video presentation

Assuming your original transaction had some small amount of change, that is still left in your wallet, you want to spend that change plus this donation to fees.  By linking that tiny bit of  change to more fees, it will raise the priority of your transaction so that it gets included in a block sooner.
Alternatively if you have access to the address and wallet that you sent the funds to, then you can do the child transaction from that wallet also.
Do you have the transaction ID of the transaction? That would help
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:01:41
Good, looks like it should have the child pays for parent feature.  Let me find some instructions 
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:12:20
Can confirm, does cause panic attack.  I've learned to just use hardware wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:19:47
You can use a child txn to force the confirmation, with child pays for parent 
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:10:15
He is checking every input (coin) of his total balance, to see if it also holds fork coins, by looking up the associated address.  Then if it does contain coins, dumping that key and sweeping it.
A more efficient way would be to just take a copy of the wallet.dat file and load it into a fork client and allow it to sync
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:38:31
There is currently a large txn backlog, your txn should stay in the mempool for 72 hours, if not longer

Linux file tools, does a good job
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:07:15
Do you still have a tiny balance?  Looks like this feature only works if you pay the entire balance to yourself 
Pay the entire balance to fees, your small existing balance (hopefully) + $5 I sent you = ~$5 in fees.  
By this txn confirming, it will force your parent txn to also confirm, since your change from your original txn is part of this txn.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:32:29
Bump fee is the option you want, cpfp stands for child pays for parent.  Maybe need to wait on the confirmation on the $5, not sure of what mycelium requires but should be less than 6
Are you getting this error with bump fee?
"Unspent outputs are not sufficient to build the transaction"

Cool, a centralized authority feature

I meant my problem, not yours.
I don't see Segwit as a building block, but a bandaid, would prefer solutions that don't require Segwit, if they exist 
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:22:43
Is there an option to spend the maximum balance?  You want to do that, and also set a fee to at least 4 to 5 dollars.  And just spend to yourself at 
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:19:11
Because Bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin in their eyes.  Segwit upgrade will change the address scheme on Bitcoin Core, so this problem should largely correct itself if Segwit is the miracle promised.

They are inversely connected.  Bitcoin, and other commodity money is a hedge to that possible event.  
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:54:43
Did your original txn have any change?  Do you have your txnid?  Do you know how to build a child txn that pays for the parent?
Do you have a full node?
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:46:10
Something is wrong with that key, missing the end?
