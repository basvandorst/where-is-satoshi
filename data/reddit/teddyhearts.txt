It means they can continue to charge the 3% and rip off the entire country until another decent exchange appears.

Using .com, Thanks I'll give the bitpay extension a try.

Cody that is not Virtex's real e-mail but thank you for attempting to fish for account information

Thanks for posting, replied above.

No no, its because there "mission is to become the first sanctioned and regulated exchange by the Canadian Government" so lets just up the fees to ridiculous amounts. At this point it is cheaper to wire cash to MtGox than it is to sell on a CANADIAN exchange, which is disgusting.

If you hear anything please let me know. I will be bumping this on Monday if I haven't heard anything

If your trying to deposit cash at the moment of a price drop, you're already doing it wrong my friend. 
Can't tell you how happy I am to see another exchange, they will be getting ALL of my business.

Ya I get that, but I haven't heard from anyone in 8 days you don't think that is a bit much? The least they could do is answer the phone once in the span of 8 days not leave it off 24/7. 
If they are legitimately backlogged that means they are **ATLEAST** 8 days behind in e-mails, messages, etc. as I've tried to contact them all of these ways. That is something you make a public post about as that is more than just slightly backlogged. That is severely behind! 
Bottom line is you should be able to at least **TALK** to someone at the exchange **ONCE** over the course of a week to find out what is happening with your money should you not?

I can't delete posts, they probably got deleted for posting a phishing e-mail in the last post you made. Unless you live in Calgary and can go there that's the only way I can think you would be able to get a hold of him.

I've been awaiting verification

Thanks Frozen I read that the day it was posted, but the thing is I don't find that an acceptable post to make and then not answer customers for in what a few hours will be a total of **9 days.**
For 8 days currently I have not been able to get a hold of **ANYONE** in CaVirtex staff, that is under **NO** means acceptable business practice. No e-mails, no calls, no messages, **NOTHING.** They have my money and in many users cases a lot more than I do trapped within their site. Am I supposed to find it acceptable after reading that they are allowed to drop off the face of the earth for as long as they want?
I really think they need to chime in here, update the message on their site, send out e-mails to customers, ANYTHING. I'm literally about ready to make a drive down to the office to find out whats going on.
If anyone has any recent contact with CaVirtex before they stopped answering calls a week ago please let me know.

Ya I thought of that but then I have to pay the 3% fee again wouldn't I? I already payed this when I sold my coins. Kind of absurd to have pay 6% to a company just for inadequate service.

My private information isn't on here, and second off I've sent 7 e-mails total so its actually .7 emails a day. So not quite one a little less than 15.
When did they get in touch with you?
@_date: 2013-03-09 22:31:39
It takes a while mine just went through no problem, there are not many coins now being sent shared.
Took 4 hours for mine to go through but it did
Also note that I was transferring well over 200 coins, so I don't think they are after your .814 coin the system is probably just having a hard time dealing with requests.
