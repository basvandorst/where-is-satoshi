Many people store coins on exchanges like BFX, Coinbase, as they use them for trading. I don't know how they are programmed exactly, but it is reasonable that they could rely only on single commercial API.

Warren Buffett is a person who has never used crypto currency. He is a theorist who has no real experience.

It's too early to think about traveling only with Bitcoin, without a fiat you can not do.

The story of mayonnaise was very amusing, so in my opinion, they were revealed by Bloomberg. It's sadly that such type of start-ups undermine investor confidence in projects, which ultimately harms the entire system.

It is unfortunate that the project mentioned in the article has not yet launched. The idea is brilliant. I have been working in blockchain for 2 years and have not seen anything similar so far. Genius is simplicity, as they say.

Banks are sort of interested in Blockchain but usually have no clue what to do with it. The technology is new, loads of special features and not many people have the patience to do the homework and study all of it. Happy to hear about the launching of a new project that is supposed to put things right.
