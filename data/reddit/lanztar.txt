It is true that I am trying to cautious, but that is mainly because I haven't really looked into the technical background of Bitcoins (and other crypto) until just recently, therefore my knowledge and understanding of it is less than most people who frequent this sub. 
  
However, that has no bearing on my volatility tolerance. 
  
I am just curious as to why I see people throwing all of their savings into Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, even taking out sizeable loans to fund these investments. What makes them so confident that they will receive a return on Bitcoin - large enough to gamble with their entire wealth?

I was thinking about buying a Ledger Nano S. Is this a good wallet?
  


  
Why not? The market cap is miles ahead of the other contenders. Or do you see something like Ethereum surpassing it?

Can say the same thing to someone who bought at $1100 earlier this year then it dropped to $800. Hindsight creates "geniuses" in both directions.

Hi, I'm from an Eth sub.
  
From my experience, we upvote positive Bitcoin news (such as celebration of the latest $2000 ATH!). Most of us understand Bitcoin is still the gold standard of cryptocurrency and that the fall of Bitcoin would tarnish the reputation of cryptocurrency and drag all other alts down with it.
  
Ultimately, Ethereum and Bitcoin are targeting different goals as cryptocurrency. Battling each other is a fool's game.
  
The minority Etherians who diss Bitcoin are children who don't understand.

That depends on the investor; would people rather buy Tesla stock or gold? The latter is certainly more 'secure' and 'stable', but does that make it the better investment? With risk also comes reward. The best strategy is to diversify based on your risk tolerance.

That is the only reference to Rootstock in the entire article, and given the way it is phrased, I would be highly surprised if Prism is launched with RSK within the same *year* as Ethereum. They are merely speculating optimistically due to its smart contract compatibility but I doubt any development has even been initiated. Prism will already have massive Ethereum usage by then. Lets also hope Bitcoin's internal issues doesn't implode itself before then as well.

By your logic, why isn't everybody using Litecoin? It's a faster version of Bitcoin right...?

Crypto market boom.

This statement is wishful delusion. Enterprises developing private chains *on Ethereum* will not touch Bitcoin nor its sidechains with a 100 feet pole. Bitcoin has driven away its developer network effects, and they are not coming back.
  
Also, Bitcoin has lost its ["most secure hashrate"]( title already. By PoW standards, the Ethereum network is now more secure than Bitcoin.
  


  
Perhaps compared to the *current* Ethereum. But did you forget Raiden MVP is 85% complete and will rollout in the coming month? Can Rootstock beat *1 million tps*? Also with PoS/sharding on the horizon, scalability and transaction speed will become a nonissue; absolutely no competition.
  
The problem with Bitcoin maximalization is that you see Bitcoin as the *only* blockchain. You think Bitcoin will incorporate more technological innovation and maintain global dominance. Sadly, through the conflicts between mining, development, and the long drawn-out block size debate, BTC dominance has fallen below 50% and is continuing its descent. Bitcoin has clearly shown its inability to adapt and progress beyond its problems. 
  
And RSK is (unfortunately) tethered to all of that.
  
tldr; Basically, unless you absolutely refuse to hold anything but Bitcoin, there is no reason to ever use what's proposed for Rootstock. It's less capable, less secure, less scalable, more centralized, and will be two years behind Ethereum's smart contract network effect (at a minimum). If Rootstock launched a year ago *and* Bitcoin wasn't such a toxic pile of block-size civil war, I would see it as viable competition to Ethereum.

Pumped up by pro-Bitcoin Barry Shillbert as an attempt to undermine ETH. In the end, the big money goes to innovation and productivity, not ideology.

But you trust the developers of Bitcoin? Which faction of them? Just the other day they were having some backroom secret meeting about a completely different scaling route to stall/undermine UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:50:30
The long-term goal is for private and public chains to interoperate with each other.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:11:24
True, but Raiden is in active development with a rollout period in the near future. Not a question of 'if' but 'when'. 
  
I wish I could be as optimistic about a scaling solution for Bitcoin. 
  
And yes, I own Bitcoin.

People use Ethereum as store of value as well, but that does not make it any different in terms of speculation.
