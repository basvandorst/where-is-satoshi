The last sentence is the key

If you think this is bitcoin is really the future, then go ahead. But as always, don't put the amount that you can't afford to lose.

I think you're right. Using the word remittance will most likely be an obsolete word because the integrity of bitcoin will make every transaction much fluent than a money transfer transaction with 3rd party involved.

Bitcoin will not be gone in Russia. The only thing that might get affected is those people aren't even familiar with this.

Actually the peak yesterday had approx 26,000 unconfirmed txs at a single point. They need to increase the blocksize. I think the connection speed won't be an issue. Even if they have 100mb blocksize, 1.33megabits/s will only be a tiny amount of your whole bandwidth(approx 0.17mbps).

Circle is a really awesome app for people who don't know bitcoin to start using bitcoin. The UI is fluent and beautiful. Although since I use breadwallet and blockchain so I only use Circle as an exchange, I really think Circle is both an awesome wallet and exchange!
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:08:57
Yes you can but only use those exchanges
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:12:04
If you're in US I would prefer Circle.

* Mobile: Breadwallet
* Anything larger use Electrum or Blockchain.info
Full node consumes large amount of disk space. There are really a few choices of lightweight wallet. For instance, multibit sucks since it doesn't even allow you to change the transaction fee amount. Although I'm currently using Blockchain.info since I knew that before Electrum, Electrum could be a REALLY awesome option. 
Pocket money is obvious breadwallet. No matter the UI or the security breadwallet did that pretty well.

They are always saying this which is really appropriate. They can't just actually using their old system with blockchain tech and saying that they're using bitcoin technology. Bitcoin is brought to change this system instead of using their OLD system.

Inertia happens on almost everything especially financial stuff. Just wait for few years, it will eventually grow up and more people will start using it.

Since I don't have bitcoin core on my computer, I didn't know there were over 2.6k unconfirmed txs at a time.
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:56:43
My choices:
* Desktop: Blockchain.info
* Mobile: Breadwallet(iOS only)
Based on my experience, I'm currently using Blockchain.info for my desktop since I don't want to run a full node and all the lightwallet are bad on desktop. Multibit is really bad at customize and I really don't like Electrum's interface. Since I'm an iOS user so I chose breadwallet. If you're an Android user I would recommend you to use Bitcoin Wallet([Play Store Link]( I like Bitcoin wallet and bread are because they're all standalone.
Have fun by using bitcoin! 50 bits

No it doesn't mean it need to cost that much time to download. The thing it said is how old the blockchain data you are downloading currently. In your case you're now downloading the blockchain data from 2 yr 31 weeks ago.

It's truly hard to see this. Big move since NC banned it. Hopefully more good news will come. (Extremely hard for me to find a place says bitcoin accepted, maybe it will change)
@_date: 2015-05-28 22:24:49
Yeah, that will be much precise. It also buys coins from you though. Probably the coins I bought are from other people selling. Sorta exchange although we don't really no who we are actually exchanging with.
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:11:42


That's a good point actually. Most people just keep saying that those bitcoiners are just keep letting more of them involved in bitcoin and then the price will go up and they will make bunch of profits. That's not what bitcoin was intended to do.
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:43:30
This is actually an amazing idea. A lot of people(including me) are willing and interested in running a full node but couldn't afford to run it on a normal desktop or laptop since it consumes energy. This is a great product. The only thing is the price is a little bit high for this single board computer. Also is it possible to run this system on a raspberry pi?
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:43:30
Some PEOPLE keep saying they KNOW about what bitcoin is. They just keep holding the point that when more people join, the price will go up and the original holder can gain profits.
I actually tried to clarify that bitcoin was not intended to make profit. In fact, it was posted on bitcoin.org. Truly a lot of people are using bitcoin to invest and made a REALLY BAD impression on those people who thought they knew from those investors.
 I started using bitcoin 3 or 4 months ago. The regulation actually made most of the people who's interested in bitcoin LESS ENTHUSIASTIC in buying bitcoins.
Besides, a large portion of bitcoin user doesn't know the tech part of the bitcoin protocol. They just simply use it. I believe if more user know about the protocol then there will be less amount of people holding the ponzi scheme theory.

Maybe I will see more "Bitcoin Accepted" sign in the future. Keep going!
@_date: 2015-05-22 14:08:07


Definitely, I really didn't expect that happened.

There are actually two choices for you.
First is localbitcoins.com. There are a lot of people selling. The problem that localbitcoins might have is the price might be too high. Different choices are available like cash deposit or different kind of gift cards. It's much more complicated than a exchange.
Second option is that if your parents allow you to buy bitcoins you can try Circle. It is a web bitcoin wallet where you can buy bitcoins using your credit/debit card or bank accounts. Circle might be the only exchange that accepts people below 18 GLOBALLY. You just need to email the support and they'll send you an parental consent form. Just let your parents filled out the form ELECTRONICALLY then you're done.
Enjoy bitcoins, have two dimes. @_date: 2015-04-27 22:13:17
This is really a huge benefit for someone in Nepal because of the earthquake. Really touching.

I used to have some kind of experiences like that. Someone accidentally paid me $0.02. I have no clue who sent that. I don't know what's the possibility to accidentally send bitcoins to an valid wrong address.
@_date: 2015-03-20 21:09:09
That's up to you. What price will you mostly likely sell to me?

How's the condition of those usb miner? Can you send a photo so I can make the decision?
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:08:31
Good job! I went on coinmap before and there's no merchants near my home. Places I can spend coins are all the online sites like gyft. Hope in the future more local merchants will start accepting bitcoins!
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:42:32
Thank you maybe I went into the wrong one.
