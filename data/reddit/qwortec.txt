Nah, you're just tone deaf. All of your comments are super standoffish.

Nah, it's just normal social interaction. The way you present ideas or questions is going to affect how the other person responds. If they feel like you are attacking them or trying to trap them they will be on guard and defensive. Just look at how police conduct interviews, the good ones don't get aggressive right off the hop, they try to develop a rapport with the suspect so they feel more comfortable talking and they can more easily catch them in lies or contradictions. If they attack most people become uncooperative. The same applies in most other interactions between relative strangers.

You're dealing with humans and trying to talk about complicated topic in which people have a lot of invested time and ego. The way you approach social interactions is important regardless of the underlying truth of your claims (which I'm not judging either way).

Wouldn't the argument be that it's gold that you don't need to pay to secure and can transfer easily and convert to another currency quickly and relatively cheaply? 
My understanding (limited as it is) is that most BTC transactions are on Chinese exchanges where Chinese are trying to move money out of the country. It's easier to buy this safe digital asset and accept the volatility risk than dicking around buying real estate and other physical assets in countries that are more and more hostile to the activity. 
I'd be happy to have someone tell me why this is mistaken though.
