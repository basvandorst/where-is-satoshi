Unfortunately this is another reason not to keep anything substantial parked on Coinbase or any other website.

There are really only a handful of websites that allow for exchange between fiat and crypto.  It's a major issue!

I would recommend a hardware wallet.  The advantage is that you can access it whenever, it adds security, and it's physical so you don't have to worry about a website going down.  The downside is that losing the hardware wallet (essentially the size of a USB key) means that you lose all of your coins.  Additionally, you'd still need to use a website like Coinbase to exchange out for fiat.

I don't believe that this attack will alter Bitcoin's place as the primary cryptocurrency.  Some people might (certainly the ones pushing Bitcoin Cash).  If that's the case, losing those people serves a market correction since as we prune users back to the "true" Bitcoin market.

I mean, Bitcoin Cash and other Bitcoin offshoots trade on the cachet of Bitcoin which I think is where a lot of their value comes from.  Not saying whether or not this is legitimate but making this altcoin naming stick would be a difficult.

It's a classic reactionary move where people take only the most recent x days as their perspective while forgetting about everything else that has happened.  People that think Bitcoin is in some existential freefall forget that it is returning to its price from something like, two weeks ago.  Nothing about Bitcoin has changed.  It still maintains all of the advantages that it had last week.  No other coin can rival its ubiquity both in the cryptocurrency world and the non-cryptocurrency world.  The market needs to relax.

Bitcoin has the highest utility in countries that cannot promote their own currencies.  Its advantage as a decentralized currency allows it to operate in places where citizens have lost faith in the government and issuing authority.  Fiat only maintains value if there is confidence in the agency issuing it.  A country like Zimbabwe should have NO confidence placed in it given its history and thus is ripe for Bitcoin as a stabilizing force (Bitcoin's volatility aside).

I'm waiting to buy back in.  $5500 isn't a bad thing!  Bitcoin will still be around tomorrow!
