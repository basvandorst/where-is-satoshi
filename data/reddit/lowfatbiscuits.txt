If promises by 3rd parties aren't kept, do you have recourse?

Blockchain isn't for 5 year olds or 2 year olds. And my "care" has nothing to do with efficiency of my free time. Watch the video.

You can't unmove Bitcoin, if that answers your question. Bitcoin is a push only system. No pulling back funds once they've been pushed.  
Also, recommend a factory refresh on all machines, and change all passwords.

Well, I never...huff.... Millennial right? I can smell the entitlement. You don't just want me to help, you want me to "want" to help. LOL get out.

Is there any cloud mining that isn't a pyramid scheme with no connection whatsoever to Bitcoin PoW? I honestly don't know.

Let me predicate first, lest I be banned, by saying "boo hiss Jihan. I hate alts".  That said, your assumptions and estimations of his intentions are just that. I say welcome the competition; Look at the attention it brings to issues. If a community is to decide anything, first they must understand the issues involved. More than mere ritual, this situation is the sunshine that disinfects what's festering. Focusing on who is bad or good rather than what's right and wrong, is just spinning wheels. It doesn't matter if he's bad (you don't anyway), as long as you're right (THAT you can know). If Bitcoin is to make any serious progress with the values it implies, there will be proverbial, if not literal blood in the streets (I mean more blood than has already been spilled in the name of self-determination) before Bitcoin's story is told. This isn't going to be comfortable.

Bitcoin Meetups, and Mycelium Localtrader are 2 other options for peer-to-peer trading. You may have to hunt wherever you go, to find traders who won't ID you. As long as you aren't getting USD thousands at a time, you should be able to find some.  A place like bitquick.co will allow purchases under (I could be wrong, and it could vary) $300 without an ID. I suggest sticking to efficient payment methods for your purchases, like in-person-cash, and cash deposit directly into the sellers bank account. The latter method being the lowest fees you will likely find. You will pay much more per BTC for using something like Paypal, or gift cards, or prepaid cards, etc...

Depends if you care about anonymity, account-verification wait periods, over-zealous compliance departments, that sort of thing.  Coinbase is popular, and also suffering service lag plus the other things I mentioned. If you want to pay an extra 5%, you can get bitcoin more conveniently at places like localbitcoins, bitquick.co, paxful, libertyx, local bitcoin atms, bitsquare maybe... If you want to start buying larger amounts, where you can justify the wire transfer fees, then your options open up substantially.

The blockchain doesn't "split into two"; Blockchain does not have that ability. Rather a person operating a Proof-of-Work node creates a new chain, a new network, a new set of rules, and invites others to join his new version. Complex and unpredictable game theoretical chaos ensues, followed by an eventual but unknown new reality. Don't be fooled by the absolute claims of knowledge regarding outcomes. There is a lot of skin, and many games in which it may be placed.
