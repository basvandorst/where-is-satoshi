The issue is money laundering, the banks in the UK are terrified of touching anything which is known to be related to money laundering.
After the HSBC fines the other year in the US (with big ones coming for Barclays soon) nearly all the big 8 UK banks have been cracking down and closing accounts for existing customers on almost all money service businesses.
There are maybe 300+ banks in the UK, but only the 8 big ones have direct access to the payments network. Everyone else clears through them. When they say no to any kind of business other banks using their networks must obey.

The difficult part of an exchange has never been the software, it's always been getting the banking working correctly.
Of course this has not stopped people fucking up the software part either.

Sure they did, do a google image search for bitscalper and look for a passport picture. They were roundly criticised for doing so as well.


Ouch, from the shutdown or from a scam company?

Is this not a case for regulation? How else is this supposed to be resolved without using the police?

Was it not set up this way? Wasn't this part of the reason a lot of people used it, to stay anonymous?

HSBC for one are closing LOTS of accounts (not just bitcoin ones), RBS is also doing so on a smaller scale.

Totally true, but they (banks) are terrified of being seen to to be allowing money laundering. And they are "private" businesses so they can give accounts to who they like.

It wasn't like Karpeles at all, you have it backwards. They voted to move to become compliant (not SEC, is wasn't in the US), the board OK'd it.
The legal advice they got back was to shut down, at that point other board members (ones holding bitcoins?) torpedoed the shutdown and caused the mess. There are records of the whole mess but nearly everyone got most their bitcoin back.
