For most of the relevant laws, "small" is measured by number of shareholders.  The SEC considered facebook a "small" billion dollar company for many years.
If these tokens are actually recognized as equity (highly questionable) this company will not be "small" in any way that matters.

Nor is meaningful pruning possible with bitcoin.  Every lone one-satoshi output whose owner lost the private key costs everybody more than one satoshi of disk space, forever.  Most of the blockchain mass is dust created by satoshidice.  Pruning doesn't change that.  Deal with it.

You have missed the forest for the trees.  **It's the masksets, son.**  At $10mm a pop (and rising) nowadays there are at most four on the face of the earth (for leading edge processes) and more likely only three.   Wake up.  **That** is centralization.
Your hypothetical doomsday scenario with a few dozen $300k installations in regions with cheap hydropower sounds like a paradise of freedom and decentralization compared to the current maskset ownership situation.  You're off by a factor of at least 30x there.  Unfortunately the maskset owners are smart enough to keep their mouths shut and most bitcoiners don't even know what a maskset is.
Cheap electricity is a total red herring.  The vast majority of farming (y'know, like food) nowadays has concentrated itself into locations with rich soil and plentiful water, yet basic agricultural markets remain liquid and unmonopolized.  The aluminum industry has been geographically localized around cheap electricity for decades now.
**TL;DR: Just because you can't do it in your dorm room anymore doesn't mean it's centralized.**
Yes (profitable) dorm room mining is doomed for bitcoin and probably any other successful cryptocurrency.  You don't seem to appreciate the difference between that and having to write an eight-figure check to a foundry.

You mean PoW-longest chain, which means they won't find themselves on this fork.  Pre-UASF clients will follow the miners, this is what they're programmed to do.
I can build a fake chain a billion blocks long and no client software will switch over to it unless it is the chain with the greatest cumulative PoW.  That's not a political position, it's simply how the code is written.
UASF is a total contradiction in terms, since the only way they are really a soft fork is the scenario you describe.  But in this scenario they aren't user-activated, they're miner-activated!

I call bullshit.
The fiat system makes it very hard ("it's not a bug it's a feature!") to convert any significant amount of funds from electronic form to irreversible final payment (cash or bullion) quickly enough to be able to deliver the decryption key and get away with the loot.
I think it's a bug, personally.
But I'm still calling bullshit on you.

Yeah and unfortunately they might never get around to it.
There's this massive scam called "reinsurance" which is just a loophole in antitrust/monopoly regulations.  Basically the insurance industry is considered special and gets to ignore those laws by chanting the magic incantation "RE IN SUR ANCE".  And then all the politicians just start gibbering and let the pillaging continue.

I'm sure that having a sense of purpose is good for its karmic well-being.  Markets don't care about that.  They care about supply and demand.


They only need it for a moment right before buying the oil.  They don't need to hold dollars, they just need to buy them shortly before reselling them.
Look think about it, has the worldwide demand for oil in any way shape or form kept pace with the rate of US money-printing? Hell no.
This petrodollar business hasn't explained any significant part of the situation since the mid-1970's.

@_date: 2017-05-22 07:46:53


Maybe people are actually using bitcoin instead of just speculating.
If you bought bitcoin *as an investment* and it appreciated while you held it, you must file form 8949.
On the other hand, the tax code clearly exempts from 8949 reporting in US Code 1221(a)(1) the following:


... which pretty much describes bitcoin's business role for miners, professional traders on localbitcoins, or vendors on various markets of ill repute.  Note that by declaring bitcoin to be property and not money, the IRS has conceded that any exchange of BTC with a customer for anything else is a "sale to customer" of that BTC, since the BTC is property.
Form 8949 is not for your inventory or for actively employed business assets -- if it were the entire economy would screech to a halt under the paperwork tsunami.  Appreciation in the value of business assets like those described in 1221(a)(1) is ordinary income reported as a lump sum and taxed "in bulk" with all the business' other profits.
But if you're buying BTC because you think it will go up and it does, then yeah, you gotta file the form.

Money laundering laws apply only to money.

If you're willing to take a haircut you can get people with good reputations on darkmarkets to mail you cash or precious metals in escrowed transactions.  Cheap?  No.  Anonymous?  Yes.  Also takes time to build relationships for larger deals, but you have to just treat that as part of the cost.

The government will definitely appeal this loss to the Florida supreme court.
Whoever loses there will definitely appeal it to the SCOTUS... either the government will lose+appeal or else it's very likely some benefactor or nonprofit will fund the defendant's appeal if he loses the next round.
This will be the case that decides the issue, although it'll take several years.

Chelan is just one of the hydropower counties, and it's the ONLY one with transmission lines to Seattle.  To spell it out, **they are the only one who can sell power to a major urban area.**
Grant PUD's largest hike this year was less than five percent (+$0.002/kwh under worst-case rate assumptions, could be less depending on how you're classified):
Grant County is where the Microsoft+Yahoo data centers are (as well as a lot of others).
Please don't buy mining hardware assuming that hydropower is getting more expensive.  It isn't.  Moving that energy out of the mountainous unpopulated areas is the expensive part, and shipping mining hardware into the mountains will always be cheaper.
