Hes my colleague.  When BTC was $3k, they said why should I buy something that lost 85% of its value?  Now they say, it's too expensive to buy, I'll wait for a dip.  Bottom line is, they'll never understand it or buy it.

Hes not a guy who can be wrong so it's hard to talk about anything with him.  He just says all the wrong things like hes some authority- about charting, about monetary policy, and BTC use.  Hes a walking headache.  I've been in this space for years and doing research every single day.

True.  But you dont have to buy a whole bitcoin.  If you bought at $50 and sell at $250, you made $200.  If you buy at $10k and sell at $50k, you made $40k!

Well, he'd suggest you bought your food at the black market, I guess.

I expect that as well.  But right now, I'm THAT crazy guy in the office hodling BTC.  One guy asked when I'd sell and I said maybe at 6 figures and everyone laughed like I was a moron.  Guess well see eventually.

Lol I'll think about it.  Mostly, I just want my friends to share the success with me.  But alas- I'm the crazy person buying fake internet money...

I'm so tired of reading this.  You should've bought at $3k instead of talking about it.  I wish I bought it at $1.

He also said the best time to buy BTC is when FOMOing because the price is going up.  He knows nothing about bitcoin but will lecture you on why hes right.  I'll savor this moment in the years to come

If I can educate someone, I do.  But some people have to be right (even when they're dead wrong).

Looking for a good, interesting book on the petro dollar and the value of currencies etc.  Any recommendations?  I'd appreciate your help, gentlemen
