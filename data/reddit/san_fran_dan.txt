I dearly hope that young, impressionable people of limited means don't take your advice.
As for the rest, your written behavior is deplorable, and if we were in the same room, I'd take my leave.

Thank you for being civil.
My comment, that started so much vitriol was as follows:
"Please consider diversifying your investments."
Bubbles follow the pattern you've described.  In fact, if you look up bubble, this comes up rather early, and predates Bitcoin:
Take a look at r/bitcoin.  The level of unanalytical enthusiasm positively *reeks* of both the '08 housing bubble and '01 dot.com bubble.  Those were years in the making as well.
The people writing of jumping on the train, or the rocket, or getting rich, aren't talking of actual value added or analyzing potentials risks to the investment.
On that front, I'm very leery.  Anyone looking at a cryptocurrency and thinking it's a no-brainer investment is - in my opinion - dangerously underestimating risk.  That's why I encourage people to diversify their risk by not putting everything in bitcoin.
That advice, here, appears to be heretical - a word that is very fitting, given the prevailing mindset.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  Bitcoin is not a sure thing.  There are no sure things.
Have a nice day, and congrats on a good day for bitcoin investors.

It seems like you want to be angry.
As you've just boastfully indicated, you _have_ diverse assets.  Congrats.
For every google, amazon, and microsoft, there's Pets.com, ClariNet, and a thousand other ventures with 10,000 other investors that are in the dustbin of history.  The Google/Amazon/Microsoft guys were the lucky ones, not necessarily the smart ones.
It seems to me that you are reacting angrily because in this self-reinforcing silo of enthusiasm, any dissenting voice might break the irrational enthusiasm.
But hey, chief.  Sell your home, cash out your IRA, and put it all in bitcoin.  Get rich.  Yay, you.  If you _aren't_ doing those things, then maybe we agree that diverse assets is a good idea.

All eggs.  One basket.  Bad idea.  Ask any investment advisor.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:35:15
Hey, man - I hope you're right.  Yay, riches.
My initial point remains valid, and I feel sad for the people who ignore it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:25:49
Every investor in a bubble thinks it's different this time.  Every one.  Every time.  Perfect correlation.

This self-reinforcing silo can lead to bubbles.
Please consider diversifying your investments.  Putting *everything* in Bitcoin is an act of greed over wisdom.

r/bitcoin is in mania.  Look at the articles.
Bitcoin has increased tremendously in price in the last few months, but can you articulate what has happened to rationally change its valuation? 
My primary concern is for financially vulnerable people who could, inspired by the echo chamber of enthusiasm here put everything into bitcoin when it _could_, like anything else, go haywire.

"Opportunity of a lifetime."
Every.  Bubble.  Ever.
But, hey, I never, ever said don't invest in Bitcoin.  I said don't invest EVERYTHING in Bitcoin.
But that's not enthusiastic enough for this frenzied group.
I've seen dot com bubbles, I've seen housing bubbles - both up close.
If this isn't a bubble... well, I'm missing out by my insistence on having other investments.
I'm not seeing the pompous assholery, except in as much as I'm daring to post in r/bitcoin without being a member of the cult.
All done.  Y'all remind me of r/the_donald.  Cheerlead or leave seems to be the rule.  I'm leaving.  Bye!  Good luck.

And for every one of those billionaires, there are others who are cruising Reddit, hoping to strike it big.
Hey, do what you like.  Invest in pork belly futures as far as I'm concerned... but there is a non-zero chance that bitcoin will go belly-up.
Bubbles are made by people who can't assess risk.
Good luck.
