**Centralized vs DECENTRALIZED**
The Blockchain has been proven very stable and anti fragile, the more is attacked the stronger it gets. Governments can try to put barriers, but can't ban mathematics, can't kill decentralized systems, only can affect individual companies, but never bitcoin/blockchain itself. And it has been proven also very safe: Centralized companies/entities (Silk Road, MtGox, NeoBee, Butterfly, etc) fail due to their own corruption and/or incompetence, and can be a scam or a ‘ponzi’, like in any other area. The Blockchain (the system/protocol/platform) remains untouched because it is decentralized and 'antifragile', evolving and becoming ever stronger.

Bitcoin/blockchain hasn't caused anyone to go broke, or even to lose a single cent. Centralized institutions and corrupt individuals have. 
It is like blaming the dollar or gold if someone gets into a dollar funded ponzi or a gold scam.
The technology is safe and strong. Centralized companies/entities (Silk Road, MtGox, NeoBee, Butterfly, etc) fail due to their own corruption and/or incompetence, and can be a scam or a ‘ponzi’, like in any other area. 
The Blockchain (the system/protocol/platform) remains untouched because it is decentralized and 'antifragile', evolving and becoming ever stronger.

Because your question makes no sense. All you need to use bitcoin, to be your own bank, is a $30 android smart-phone, and beyond that, bitcoin can be transferred over text message in non-smart phones (like M-Pesa is already widely used in Africa), and even over radio waves.

@_date: 2015-03-07 07:29:40
Correct, but they have already done it for longer that most had imagined, there are many signs that let us know that the dam wall of control and manipulation is coming down, we can see the cracks. growing ever bigger and a faster rate, just nobody can predict when the wall will give in finally. But fall it will, since instead of making efforts to fix the cracks, the only think being done is accumulating more water behind it, without even hearing a voice of alarm from the ones in control or even using any pressure release valve, and just keep saying: "Don't worry, this wall is way to strong to fall", just like in all previous crisis right to the minute until it finally happens.

2025: "Flashback News- User 'saschas01' (in a then polpular network that was known as 'Redit') foolishly paid 100 millibitcoins for a pizza (for those few still using dollars, around $100,000), he could've bought a house now with that amount".
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:32:51
Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized distributed computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). Dollars are not backed by gold anymore since long time ago, they are printed by the trillions out of nothing by the private institution called "Federal" Reserve.

Totally agree, 99% of people don't see it coming until is too late. And right now not one, but several bubbles are about to pop (stock market, credit card debt, student loan debt, real state, Europe/PIGS crisis, China growth bubbles, global quadrillion derivatives, etc), it will probably be this last one (derivatives) or the stock market one, but it will only take one to produce a domino effect globally.
It doesn't take a rocket surgeon to foresee that gold, silver and bitcoin prices in dollars will skyrocket. It is not *if*, but *when*.

Agree, I've been using Coinbase since the beginning, they just keep constantly and consistently improving in all areas, solid company. Even though it is  centralized, it is an important step for mainstream adoption, since most people are not technical and savvy enough to keep their bitcoins safe by themselves.

People is terrible at simple math, remember that for every "cash out" it had to be first a "cash in" = buying bitcoins first (except for the small and controlled amount that miners are rewarded).
