That's a pipedream. The far left and right will never see eye to eye enough to form such a revolution. I am a realist, and would prefer to remain realistic.

I mean... I don't completely disagree, but making the government's budget more self-sustainable without theft via taxation doesn't sound like such a bad thing to me. I wouldn't mind if they hodled classic cars, baseball cards, equities, Bitcoin etc.. if it meant that taxpayers would get more bang for their buck. You can't deny the Bitcoins would be worth more today than they were at the time the government auctioned them off.

Central Banks hold Gold and foreign currencies... Why not Bitcoin? In fact, I'd be shocked if some don't already.

FYI: the use of ad hominem like butters, funbuks, etc doesn't make your argument more compelling. That may get you upvotes on but here everyone recognizes your bias.
Yes, I realize I am biased, but everyone should be allowed to form their own opinions and act as free people, no? Your argument can be made about anything throughout the history of mankind that has appreciated in value.
If you think that's the only protagonistoc argument surrounding the value proposition of Bitcoin, then perhaps you should visit my other site  where that topic is explored in depth? ��

The website is simply trolling the government for their decision to short Bitcoin. Its purpose is to show how much the Bitcoins stash would be worth today if the government would have hodled instead of selling the Bitcoins at auction. It is not claiming it is the U.S. government's "job" to invest or trade.
I find it funny some of you have such a huge objection to the government going long on Bitcoin...
I only brought up Central Banks as an example. Governments also have treasuries which could make such decisions. They advise on fiscal policies and could help enact legislation that the justice department not sell historically appreciating assets as a way to bring down the deficit slowly over time (instead of giving such investment appreciation to private individuals).

I agree... the government is only allowed to spend money and not make it. ��

Of course!

 "The government did not "lose" anything because it was never there to begin with until after the seizure."
That is your version of the truth. That's cool. It can also be said that after the seizure it was theirs, and they lost out on the gains that would have had if they just held it instead of selling the Bitcoins for chump change to savvy businessmen.
