Woah at first I was like, is that? N'way, I think you're missing the point. It's a lot about the first hump as well, noone want's to sacrifice 2 weeks of internet for the initial syncing, or install any other shady 3rd party software that allows them to throtlle. They don't have to with bittorrent, why would they with Bitcoin? People here would rather just the turn the thing on on 5-10 kb/s and then go about their way surfing the internet. Throttling is a basic feature in a torrent client, how is it that the revolution software doesn't include it?

They have'nt been explicit about it, but I feel its a safe assumption since they made all other currencies illegal, hence the new username 4 the anonymity.

We need a encapsulated implementation. I should'nt have to argue why Bitcoin is important, and then talk about how they can install it + do more stuff to rectify this abominable weakness. I hear a lot about the other 6 billion, but this is an important part.As with other countries, most people running bittorrent in my nation are on Windows, I'm not, but they are, and they use throttling on a daily basis with bittorrent, otherwise they would'nt be using torrents.

100% certainty huh? I never implied that I am new 2 Bitcoin, considering our system, you don't think a person like me would be following Bitcoin religiously? This was my first time as a **Bitcoin owner** . Read the post. I'm writing from a new username because owning any foreign currency including Bitcoin is illegal in Nepal, hence the anonymity. You mentioned western union ... when you send money via that f'd up system I still receive it in Nepali Rupees and hence back 2 square one. You mentioned not being able 2 spend my bitcoin in Nepal, the whole point of free-lancing 4 a foreign currency was 2 be able to pay a U.S. Web hosting service for hosting my website, again read the post. ... And then you blabled about electricity and coding, I don't need 24 electricity to code from my laptop, but webhosters need that because sites need to be online 24/7. 
ps:- Great job going straight from here 2 the buttcoin sub-reddit    to show who's side you're on, It's  always good to have buttcoiners show their real colors, sorry your butt hurts.
