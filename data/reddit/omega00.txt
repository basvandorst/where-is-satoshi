To be fair, I've seen a few of the major sites showing cloudflare banners when the drop in and out for a few minutes at a time, so it's not like they haven't tried to; but all in all you're right, why they aren't putting more effort into being *the* place to be for trading is beyond me...

Please review the data for yourself and upvote the correct info!
OP is getting Cloudforge (a subversion/git code hosting site) confused with Cloudflare (a web performance and security company built on a DNS based CDN).
Cloudflare did indeed suffer a major DDoS a few weeks ago however is **not under any current attack** and is entirely reachable. I know this because I also have websites that utilise the cloudflare service to save bandwidth and protect them.
Source regarding old DDoS: 
Cloudflare's twitter account (note no outage messages about a DDoS or anything of the like at present): 
TL;DR: There is no evidence for any kind of DDoS on Cloudflare or other exchange sites other than due to legitimate (albeit high volume) user activity itself.
