That is up to you and what your financial situation calls for. I personally wouldn't sell all of my BTC ever, I would sell a portion I was comfortable with in conjunction with the amount of profit I wanted. I could throw out fake numbers like keep 10% or whatnot, but no one has the real answer. I definitely, think it's always wise to keep at least 1k invested in BTC. If someone has less than that they should probably be trying to DCA until they reach 1k of BTC. The profit is pretty negligible under 1k. Though if someone had several BTC I recommend keeping at least 1 BTC.
I mean you have to think that it is possible it will never be under 10K again, but it could also be possible it will be a while before it reaches 20k again. So consider your own financial situation, the risk of it rising or increasing, and after that hold onto to at least a small amount in case you see even bigger returns on it.

It may feel that way, but along with whale manipulation, the real deal is that you had people HODLing for 2 years waiting for a bull market. Thousands of people were waiting to profit off of the investments they made for the last 2 years. It was never going to shoot up like last time, this time at least was going to experience more resistance. You had people waiting to breakeven from FOMOing last time, people who bought big while it was low, and people panicking at the daily 700 to 1500 swings in value which slowed the FOMO. However, on the positive side, you will notice that Bitcoin's value has held over 10K pretty well so far considering all of that and more companies are investing it. It is becoming harder for whales to manipulate, and people are becoming better about hodling and DCAing so they can sell and then reinvest to stabilize the value. So next time when it rises again, it may rise as we hope.

My sister and I were discussing this exact thing the other day! We were talking about social contracts and we concluded that the only thing that really has value as a currency is our time. Gold is essentially just a shiny rock that represents the time you give away. Money could be represented by anything as long as people agree as a whole that is what they want to represent and be awarded for the time one gives away. Currently, the main compensation for the time given away is gold, but in the past people used salt. However, like you pointed out in your comment those aren't scarce like our time. Bitcoin is truly a better currency at this stage of civilization. It's independent, fair, and scarce and that is what is necessary for our growing global economy. Bitcoin doesn't let the folly and policies of countries and their governments devalue or manipulate the value of people's time.

 Bitcoin isn't a bad investment because you are a bad investor. I understand some people want to vent because they've lost money, but the problem with their mindset is that they think of bitcoin as a short term/get rich quick scheme, it isn't.  If you thought you were going to make a return immediately after buying peak then Bitcoin has nothing to do with you losing money, it's your fault alone that you didn't buy when it was low at any time over the last 18 months. Just like with stocks, if you buy during peak know it might take a while to see a return. Can you make money? Of course, but stop acting like it's owed to you when it's about making wise investments. Bitcoin is the same as stocks.  If I had bought Amazon stocks or BTC 10 years ago then I'd be peachy, but if I buy Amazon or BTC stocks now and think I am going to be making thousands of dollars tomorrow as if I bought it 10 years ago then that's stupidity. Instead, I'd buy Amazon stocks with the hope that 5 or 10 years from now I will be glad I did.
If you want to trade that's fine, but learn to be a good trader. Buy low, sell high. That's a good trader. Pretty simple. If you bought at peak that's buying high, so I don't know what you expected if you approached your investment with the intention to trade short term. I made a decent amount in profit because I have been DACing since before 2017. It took 2 years. I rebought a small portion at 10k after selling because I DAC, so I know that it will eventually balance out. 
It's pretty annoying that new people with stars in their eyes buy at the peak thinking they will make an immediate return and then go on to whine here when the price naturally corrects itself afterward. You either knew going in that buying at the peak is a risk that might mean hodling for a while, or you didn't do proper due diligence on the investment you were making. If you FOMOed, then accept that you may have to HODL, understand that people have been investing for over 2 years waiting for it to go into a bull market like this, and you just swept in at the peak hoping to make money at the end of a cycle other people invested 2 years of time and money into. You didn't even have to invest over the last 2 years, if you had invested in Bitcoin at ANY point in the last 1.5 years before this month then you would be seeing a great return on your investment with 6k+ to 10k+ return potential this bear cycle. Don't get mad that you didn't win the race when you only joined it for the last few feet, and it's still going. Instead, look forward to being prepared for the next one.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:56:57
I don't ever recommend to attempt to time the market. I recommend DACing. Anyone who has been DACing over the last 2 years bought the "bottom". However, I assure you that when the price jumps several thousands of dollars within a short time then you are buying peak. The price will eventually correct itself (especially after a 2 year bear market) and potentially fall from that point. No seasoned traders I know will buy in bulk at peak and not consider that they will lose money on their investment.

This happened to me! I was young, 19 at the time, and went into a Wells Fargo because my work issued checks from them so I could cash the checks as my regular single branch bank was always closed by the time I commuted back home. They secretly scanned and made a photocopy of my driver's license when I gave it to them to cash the check, and then they set up an account under my name and even forged my signature! I couldn't believe such a huge branch would commit fraud like that, I was in shock. At the time I couldn't fathom why they cared enough to do so as it wasn't like I was rich or anything. I obviously really raised hell in the branch about it, and the manager apologized and said it was a mistake, and that teller was fired. After they closed the account, I never went back. I've tried to warn people for the last 8 years that Wells Fargo is trash.
\--editLater on, I sort of felt bad for the employee because now that I'm older I realized they must have been under a lot of pressure to set up new accounts. I feel it should have been the manager who got fired as this Wells Fargo wasn't a traditional branch it was this teeny tiny space in a strip center so she had to have known that sort of stuff was happening and probably pushed it. In the retail world, some businesses hardcore pressure their low level employees to meet certain sales/new accounts even though they aren't in sales positions but regular cashier/teller positions to the point where the employees are berated, written up, and fired if they don't meet those standards even though it wasn't part of the job description to be a salesman all so their shareholders can have more lambos. I know for a fact that game stores, Starbucks, banks, and many others pressure their employees like this and honestly, it's disgusting.  There's nothing wrong with wanting employees to offer something, but in a non-sales position, they shouldn't be harassed about sales performance.

You usually sell through a trusted exchange, which exchange you use depends on where in the world you live. If your BTC is in a wallet then you transfer it onto the exchange to sell. You can sell directly to another from your wallet, but you probably want to use an exchange. For instance, in the USA Coinbase (but there are lots of other trusted exchanges) is pretty basic and easy to use. They allow to instantly sell and then deposit the funds into your bank account. Just know it can take a few business days for the exchange to verify your bank information.   
Steps:  
1. Set up an account on a trusted exchange for your location, you'll easily be able to use Google to find which one is best for your country  
2. Connect your bank account to your exchange account  
3. Transfer BTC onto the exchange  
4. Sell BTC which is really easy and just requires you to select all or input amount you wish to sell  
5. Withdraw your balance from the sell into your bank account

BTC is not a risky investment though. At least not to people like myself who have been investing in BTC for several years and DACing. Even when BTC dipped to 9k I'm still wayyyyy in the green. I even sold a small portion at 12.5k and reinvested at 9k and I am still very much in the green. WHY? Because buying a reasonable amount every month through DACing whether it was high or low protected me so until it drops under 6k I am good. My current investment has nearly double it's value for several months now. 
Over the last several years it has only been risky for very short term traders. People on this sub try to tell people that DACing and holding is the way to go, but still inexperienced people with dollar signs in their eyes FOMO as they want immediate profit so they buy at record value highs all at once. Their poor investment decisions don't make BTC unstable or risky. The only people who should have experienced loss are first time FOMO BTC investors who went all in one of the 2 times it was over 12.5k as there have been many opportunities to sell and take profit or break even. Bitcoin is less risky than stocks overall because you can invest in it at any price you want that fits your budget, and sell and buy instantly without worrying about it being a wash sale. You can invest $5 or $5,000. With Stocks for instance you can't buy part of a stock so if you find a company promising you have to have a set amount of capital to invest this forces people to often spend more than they really can afford. 
Also, BTC's value has held around 10k despite previous support being around 8k, fluctuations, and it's history, that is a clear mark of stability at least in terms of BTC's future. The natural fluctuation in value over the last few months doesn't bother me, at major price points people were going to sell off what they accumulated through DACing and investing in dips in the last 2 years.

Also, don't be too sad about them not selling it back, you can think of it as if you're doing the Lord's work by creating a new wave of hodl enthusiasts.
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:14:19
It's a lack of confidence. They might be being cautious since the price is sort of stagnant since the swing to 13k, and since value has been rising and falling at unsettling levels for people buying in for the first time or again after profiting from the run to 13k. Kind of one foot out, one foot in. If it goes up they don't want that remorse, but they also don't want it to dip and they be one of the buy high/ sell low people. At the way it is now, it is harder to feel confident about its immediate direction rather than say when it first hit 9k, 10k, 12k, etc... More people are also engaging in DAC, so buying will be in steadier smaller increments.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:42:43
When it comes to their money I guess people have short term memories. I think any sensible investor understands before buying bitcoin that its value is volatile at the moment and that even during "bull" runs or price increases that the value can swing between 700 to 1500 within 30 minutes. Newbies and FOMO get rich quick traders hoping to sell top are stuck in a constant state of panic so they come here anytime the price drops seeking comfort so they will stay strong and HODL, but it's like chill out people it was 3k in Jan, 5k in Mar, then now that's it's over 10k people still aren't pleased.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:18:13
I'm a huge supporter of cost averaging like this, but why not only every 2 weeks or once monthly? If you buy it daily in such small increments doesn't the fees eat up a large portion?
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:44:47
I was just guessing based on traction and resistance that it wouldn't drastically fall before tomorrow. Yes, it can drop a lot, especially if there are a lot of sell orders at 11k. I thought  I read somewhere that it was assumed that bitcoin moved value the most from whale drug lords who are laundering money via Monero, and so that's why you should never try to time crypto especially because unlike stock you don't have the business news keeping you in the know.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:34:53
Yes, I accounted that for above if you look closer. I use GDax (Coinbase Pro), if you look above the .0007 the fees are $2.99 but at .0001 they are $1.49, these are the exact percentage fees that Gdax charges for those amounts when calculating off the 11.8k+ value of bitcoin at the time.  
Even using a service that is based on percentage, the math above shows that the principle remains. Even though buying .0001 at a time is .50 cheaper per transaction, the number of transactions significantly rise. The only way to avoid it is to use a free service or a cheaper service so the amount between daily and weekly purchases don't matter.

Not everyone is male. So for lonely crypto thots like myself, I have reached a similar conclusion.
I have found through experience that most common "nice guys" will buy you a decent dinner, think a $30 to $50 entree, if you let them talk about whatever they want for close to 90% of the dinner. You can just sit there and act stupid for 45 minutes while enjoying the gilded lobster he paid for with FIAT and nod your head while saving your money for more bitcoin.
Then so you can make him GTFO after the dinner, just spend the last 10% talking about your toxic ex-boyfriend.... (smile and say "Thanks for dinner and explaining crypto to me I was always curious but it just seems too complicated)   
Works like a charm ladies.

I sold at 12.5k when I saw it staying still for a bit too long and then re-bought the dip. I had been DCAing since 2017 so I was able to sweep some nice profit and reinvest. I normally wouldn't sell, and I was lucky it dipped back down to 10.5k.

Company's that have agreed to accept BTC so far are ones that are large companies that face a lot of competition in their field. Take Starbucks or Home Depot, both are at the top of their fields, but also have stiff and successful competitors. Starbucks has hundreds of thousands of coffee shops they compete with in addition to big names and grocery store coffee. Home Depot has hundreds of thousands of small home improvement stores to compete with and big names like Lowes. These companies that have agreed are trying to stay ahead of the market. They typically throw away some money every year to make sure they are ahead of their competitors, and they love "new tech" as a means to do so. If you saw how much waste they produce and lose money on in just a given month than of course, the few people who would currently use their BTC to buy stuff doesn't phase them. I mean just work at a Starbucks for 6 months and you'd be petrified at the food waste and money being lost on the store level. Accepting BTC when so few would spend it right now is irrelevant in comparison, and they get to say they are ahead of their competitors with tech.

I understand his idea, but personally, I would buy .007 weekly instead. You can also do biweekly or twice a week if you don't want to do it monthly too, but otherwise, when buying such small increments daily you are eating your potential BTC with fees.
At .0001 a day let's say it stays exactly the same value it is right now
You end up spending:
$13.47 a day and $1.49 in fees daily
or  $94.29  and  $10.43 in fees weekly
or  $377.16  and  $41.72 in fees monthly
That's a total of $418.88 a month
However, at .0007 weekly:
$86.80 a week with $2.99 in fees weekly
or $346.56 and $11.96 in fees monthly
That's only $358.52 in comparison to $418.88 for the same amount of BTC
Essentially by shifting buying weekly at the most, you are either saving $60 in FIAT or BTC monthly or $720 year

I totally understand. The hardest thing is hindsight when it comes to investing, especially in volatile markets like crypto currently could be considered. You can clearly see that there is profit to be had if you can buy low, sell high, the problem is that the price swings very quickly with crypto so it's pretty hard to make sure you don't get/feel burned in the process. 
I completely agree that it was unconscionable for Robinhood and Coinbase, two of the largest FOMO and first time US exchange platforms to incur "issues" as soon as the price was rising to a new high level and then dropped. 
Honestly, for long term investors, HODLing is important with bitcoin but even more so is cost averaging, especially if you think you may feel too uneasy with the price swings. Buying in the dip is the best thing to do, but to engage in cost averaging you can set it up where you have a small automatic reoccurring purchase each month on your exchange for an affordable amount according to your budget (you can cancel this at any time), and then buy in the dip as well. So every month let's say you tell Coinbase or Robinhood that you wish to buy X (like 50 dollars) amount of BTC every month, that way you aren't using important savings and over time you accumulate what you can afford. Then if you see a dip you can indulge in a larger purchase on top of what you've accumulated. It also protects you from the burn of trying to time the market.

The point of this thread is that if you wish to bring up a discussion you can. You can always ask a question and try to start a discussion. There are plenty of people on here that can run circles around anyone including you if that's what you're after. I know I've had plenty of engaging conversations on this sub. So like I said, take the initiative if you can't find what you're looking for since plenty of people have had intellectual discussions on this sub. I mean I haven't seen someone bring up  Jean-Jacques Rousseau or anything like that, but it isn't beyond our mental scope.
However, you need to take the initiative. Everyone comes here for their own reasons. All the subs are going to deal with an influx of newbies and memes when the price rises. So right now you are going to see mostly Q&amp;A style discussions and a lot of people (newbies mostly) come here to cool off when they are panicking and not knowing if they should sell of hodl. Of course, we all know the answer is to hodl and DAC, but as I said you are going to see a lot of that on any BTC subreddit when the price rises.

On Coinbase, you can do it a few ways but the two easiest are:  
1. By clicking on the person icon on the top right and going to TOOLS  then select Recurring transactions and it allows you to click the "+ and add a new recurring transaction " on the right above "next run".  
2. You can click on Bitcoin or any other coin to buy it from the homepage and right next to where you enter the amount you wish to purchase on the left is a little clock above the switch to bitcoin over FIAT.

You have to bear in mind that this is expected considering it went from the winter of 3k to 8k, some people wanted to cash out so of course, the price is going to stagger a bit. Not to mention some who actually feared the ETF would be denied and drop the price. Also, right now we are seeing nearly daily swings of 500 to 1200k and that sort of volatility makes some investors and FOMOs pull out as they don't have the confidence to hold, and unless something happens that causes a significant dip, you will probably see this "barting" until it reaches 10k though if it reached 10k it will probably go full-on bull from that point.

That is cool. It's nice seeing BTC becoming more widely accepted as a form of payment. On this topic, it's hard for me to imagine most people with BTC currently want to become the next BTC Pizza Guy, even if they are anti-FIAT. Just out of curiosity do other people in this subreddit think people going to use BTC to make purchases comfortably wide-scale any time soon? It's kind of a double-edged sword scenario as if more people engaged in using BTC to make purchases, BTC would become more widely accepted, but people are also facing the potential feeling of regret if BTC's value rises significantly over the course of the next couple of years. At what price point would people feel comfortable using BTC over FIAT? Just curious what other people think.
@_date: 2019-05-21 04:50:13
I agree, that is exactly along the lines of what I was thinking. I can certainly see how widely adopted it will be in a few years, especially considering just how global economies are becoming around the world, it just makes sense. It's the same reason the Euro was and is so successful. It's interesting to contemplate about how it is currently at a crossroads of being an investment, potentially lucrative for savvy and bold traders, an alternative to FIAT for purchases, and a solid answer to global commerce. I don't know what the future holds, but it is exciting to be a part of something that is challenging the status quo with a competent and progressive approach to the growing global economy.
