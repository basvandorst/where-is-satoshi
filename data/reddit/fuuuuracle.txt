I think the centralization part is not the biggest issue. The validation of transactions through everyone is important. With the encryption some single points (mining pool operator/code) decides which transaction are included into a block without anybody else noticing.
To fix this you could make a public pool of the pending encrypted transactions and after making the block public with the decrypted transactions every node could make a check of if decrypted transaction matches the encrypted transaction in the pending pool via the public key (by encrypting again an checking the result). But that would make the standard lemma to let the same content be encrypted twice produce not the same output via nonces/IVs invalid an reduce the strongnes of the cryptography... :P

How about 
Problem seems to be the panic hive mind voting. I would guess it's mostly from people who invested a lot, but that's just a guess... To bad though, some real technical discussion about ideas would be necessary!

Only if you want extra points. It's not needed for the certificate.

I'm running one on my personal server with 10TB/Month and 1GBit/s Port and guaranteed 200MBit/s of traffic. But so far I only managed 300GB of traffic in May...

Usually when you encrypt the same thing twice it should generate different outputs, otherwise you would learn something (that is was the same message) about the content of the encrypted message.
In this case I would guess that it would still work the following way:








I guess this would work but it would increase CPU usage for everyone and increase the block and blockchain size...
Also it would delay the first check of a transaction by all nodes until the first block with it is released which would be kind of bad for mobile payments who just use the broadcast by other nodes as a first confirmation of validity.

What I just realised is that by making a transaction spent all inputs and requiring a change address when needed a client and miner only needs to traverse the chain one step. And further more by making old "coins" as inputs require no fee the whole chain is encouraged to be short for traversing and checking transactions... It's fucking brilliant.

Assignments are usually little programming exercises in your own preferred language. But to pass you only need to make at least 60% of the tests (afaik 6 smaller ones (10-15 questions) and one final). All assignments grant you bonus points and an bonus mentioning on your certificate.
On my first try i didn't have enough time so I did the course again later and just when through the first 3 weeks with the knowledge of the first try and then had enough time (besides work and life...) to finish.

Openssl gives you more options on the cipher and cipher mode to choose from. Although I don't know how you could configure digest rounds besides setting the digest itself via -md
    openssl enc -e -in $@ -out $ -aes-256-ctr
    openssl enc -d -in $ -out $@ -aes-256-ctr
I would guess that gpg uses AES in CBC mode. Openssl counter-mode would be a better choice here.

Further more a merchant could lower prices to encourage spending in anticipation that the price would rise...
So far I would guess nobody exactly knows what's going to happen as soon as a currency deflates.

Afaik the inputs for your new transaction depends on the "age" of your available coins. The "older" the coin the lower the transaction fee
If you have the new bitcoin-qt 0.9.0 you can enable the "coin control" feature in the settings. In the dialog you see a priority for every available input. That is the equivalent to the age of the coin.
When a transaction occurs the relay- and mining-fee settings are set so that old coins don't have to pay a fee.
An example based on your coins (age is just for the example, in reality the priority is based on size and conformations):
    #  amount  age
    1    5btc    5
    2    3btc    7
    3    2btc    9
To spent 6 btc your client would use the input 1 and 3. It could use 1 and 2, but 3 is older and might grant you a lower tx fee.

Problem would be that a node could only check the transaction after it has been included in a block and is not pending any longer. Further more it would promote centralisation inside a pool because not that many people/machines should have access to the private key. Otherwise it's a neat idea, but would make it vastly more difficult for usual end users.

Great Course, I can only recommend it! But be prepared to do some homework and take at least 2 days per week to learn! If it's to fast passed you can take the same course twice and therefore double the time... :)
Furthermore in regards to bitcoin, the DSA and EC parts are only in the Crypto II course starting July afaik.

You can exchange via SEPA bank transfer (EU only). Just find someone with good ratings, fair price and SEPA as payment method. Works like a charm :)

Sequentiality should not generate equal sequential hashes. As far as i get  the "hash" of your private key is only a base58 conversion. That can explain sequentiality (but not for hashes). So that would only mean that input seed/nonce/iv for generating private keys in electrum are not really good and are less random. o_O

 with SEPA bank transfer (EU) worked best for me. For more info look into  :)

So far i only used localbitcoins, I tried registering a mtgox account but cancelled it due to the long waiting period and all the account sign up requirements...
SEPA takes about 2-3 business days, same as bank transfer inside your country.

Does mining with the new usb furys (~2,5GH/s or 5GH/) alone and not in a pool has any chance a getting at least one hash right and there for 25btc in a reasonable time frame (1 year)?
