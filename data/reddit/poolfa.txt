If they got 200M new signup , they should hire new ppl. It's fucked up every time you open a new ticket, there is msg that says:'
We kindly request you to consider that currently support team is getting a lot of requests due to which processing of your requests has slowed down. We apologize for this and promise to cover the backlog we have.
BULLSHIT ...
