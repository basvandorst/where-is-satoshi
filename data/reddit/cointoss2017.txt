This dude wifes.

I wish I knew! We won't know till it comes along, and then it will seem obvious. 
List the benefits of btc, and try to imagine a way wall st. or the UN could implement those benefits with a new system.
Or, it could be as simple as a better mousetrap.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:52:28
I don't blame wall st's extended skepticism - its a paradigm shift. But it benefits them to move with public interest. They just want their pound of flesh for every transaction.
I appreciate your enthusiasm &amp; applaud your ability to recognize the value of the technology in its infancy, but maybe if you tone down the insults people will take your passion a little more seriously.

Check out the depth charts. There's a HUGE glut of sellers willing to execute, and not enough buyers. Once its past 8k it will return to steady state.

High risk, high reward.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:59:57
Whats the difference in broken or usurped? I just meant that another crypto / similar system could replace it.

I remember sending this around in 2011. Great.

I've already sold 2, so I'm playing with house money at this point. Just feels hard to continue to invest, even though its good for the tribe. (and fractionally, myself)

Crypto is the "risky" area of my portfolio, not that interesting in diversifying here :) 
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:39:30
I have a separate account for each of the subreddits I browse.
This helps prevent other redditors from coloring my comments with my own post history. For example, folks in personalfinance will immediately flame anybody who has posted in People Or, let's say I was a 52-year old failed copywriter w/ no marketable skills. You're very lucky that you live at the right time for early crypto adoption to save you.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:33:09
Why the fuck are you so toxic? Your whole post history is just...angry. Is crypto your last chance in life for financial security? Did fiat break your heart?
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:45:47
Took like 30 seconds. You have one (sad) submitted post.
Under my skin? My life is better than yours. Nothing you say on reddit will change that.
Stay salty.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:18:41
Even the biggest dips are practically double my avg cost...feels like if I'm EVER going to buy again, it should be sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:41:49
This helps! Wish I could upvote this to the top.

Not going to lie- I've stuck exclusively to bitcoin. It's the riskiest component of my portfolio, might as well make it EXTRA-risky and not diversify.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:32:07
Current price is entirely conjecture, but bitcoins true value offering is not as an commoditized investment, but rather as a way to replace fiat. I'm curious to see what percent (fraction of a percent) of transactions have occurred using bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:21:55
They want to be able to offer customers centralized investment portfolios. Imagine being able to funnel 401k-match contributions directly into crypto. Creating an accessible and easy-to-use market will be where the pound of flesh comes from. You can't pretend like the current state of crypto is a polished interface ready for primetime. Also- What sort of person would consider &lt;0.1% of global transactions to be beyond infancy?
Your condescending attitude and (perpetual?) anger create a hostile environment to anybody interesting in learning more about this technology. You are a detriment to the community, and no amount of bitcoin will make you a better person.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:20:25
The feeling will only intensify as price goes up too...
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:49:45
IDK why I responded so many times to a troll account. 90% of your posts are just flaming.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:26:02
You don't feel this? Not at all?
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:19:14
Hah, not in my lifetime. Maybe for my kids.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:30:12
Lower barrier to entry. Less hostile community.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:36:54
Agreed. It seems to explode and then chill for a year. Need bigger money involved to keep rates above even 15% YoY. (which is still, phenomenal)
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:56:54
Correct - but we can calculate the overshoot (or undershoot!) the investment phase performs if we attach a timeline to adoption. The metrics im looking for would give us the answer to the true adoption curve, and we'd be able to peg a value to a future point in time along that curve.
I have no doubt that bitcoin is currently overvalued when compared to its current utilization as a replacement for fiat - but it would be interesting to see what percent of fiat-less transactions would need to occur to justify current price ( and how far in the future that might be). IE, it could be overpriced today, but adequately priced for a point in time where 1% of all transactions are via bitcoin. Mapping that percent to a point in time would be a separate exercise.

Tilting at windmills.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:47:46
Don't get me wrong- crypto is the future, 99.9%. While Bitcoin is king in crypto, it does have flaws. It could be usurped. Thats the biggest risk IMO
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:23:52
Thats the thing- i HAVE the income stream to continue to some degree, but i feel (emotionally) like I'm not getting my money's worth anymore. Logically, I know its still the right thing to do.
