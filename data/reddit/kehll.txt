A new earning site I just launched, kmpcrypto.com has one. Sites very new and doesn’t have many users yet. However there is a lottery.

Read the rules. Mining belongs on r/bitcoinmining
@_date: 2018-09-14 01:13:49
Wrong sub

Really? You think we don't care about our troops. You are very misinformed bud. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:25:57
Because it's the best fuckin country.

What's funny about this picture is he actually looks happy ��
@_date: 2018-08-17 18:52:34
@_date: 2018-08-17 18:53:31
Could have also gone down, that's risky man.
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:53:43
Not gonna lie, I have better things to do than learn about bangkoks currency, sorry if that makes my country as a whole look stupid. Sorry America :( 
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:43:00
I guess

I hate how BCash has that much power :( 
Edit: just making a anti bcash joke y'all.

What's up?
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:27:35
How about neither? 
@_date: 2018-08-18 23:36:49
Sorry boss, but bitcoin doesn't need a new logo. :/
@_date: 2018-08-16 17:32:29
Got em 
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:20:45
Don't, he wants you to do all sorts of tasks. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 23:33:18
I'll pass. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 03:32:05
I think he just means a frame. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 06:47:39
The fucks a baht
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:08:15
Does anyone know who these guys are? Or are they just some wealthy dudes no one knows a thing about? 
@_date: 2018-05-22 03:13:01
Why is this a post? 
@_date: 2018-08-16 17:29:51
That would be a rip in the chat. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:18:08
Someone's upsetti spaghetti 
@_date: 2018-08-17 19:16:13
Or they just give money and you buy it? 
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:49:23
Oh ok, that makes sense. Thanks for the info! 
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:19:30
Wrong sub my dude 
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:54:17
“Redditor for a day.”
@_date: 2019-03-04 04:08:34
It’s fine he likes science. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 04:11:14
This is a crypto currency not a sandwich shop. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 02:17:06
I've built up a decent referral network on it, it pays. It just uses your CPU to mine. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:34:52
Where are you trying to buy it? We need more information 
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:22:09
And what makes you think that? 
@_date: 2018-06-01 02:40:52
I have a keepkey and a nano s, I store anything that can be stored on the keepkey on that, and all my altcoins on the nano s. The keepkey definitely gives me more bugs and issues than the ledger, but it's always been fixed with a quick google search or firmware update. I'd recommend the keepkey if you just want to hold BTC,BCH,Dash,Doge,litecoin and ethereum. But if you are an alt coin kinda guy, go for the ledger as it can actually hold them.

All of the ATMS I've used scan a QR code on your phone. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:07:56
I wasn't telling people to buy lol. I'm not gonna buy a coin when it's that high up. That kinda common sense. Thanks for the down vote though :) 
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:32:30
No, but if it's a scam they just have the bitcoin you sent. Nothing else. 
@_date: 2019-08-11 06:17:41
Just curious, have you got any donations to the addresses in your bio before?
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:36:33
Did you like not look through the sub at all? 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:09:18
If you bought at the top that was 100% your fault. Most of the people that bought then bought in thinking they would get rich. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:22:26
Why are you yelling? 
@_date: 2018-06-21 22:10:59
I feel ya! 
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:23:02
Idk, depends on what your buying and who it's through. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:24:34
I'd just go to a local btc ATM and buy 20 bucks worth and hodl for a long time. Not much you can do with 20. 
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:09:30
He could use the address for other things. Doesn’t mean it’s donations.
@_date: 2018-06-21 22:04:26
Bitcoins? Plural? I believe you over paid my friend. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 05:30:48
The XRP and NEO ones were the best I could find. 
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:26:09
USB miner, they used to actually be able to mine sorta well, many years ago.
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:55:41
I really like using it. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:45:07
It's not really idiot proof is it? I never thought of that. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:38:19
You won't be disappointed!
@_date: 2018-06-17 16:30:34
He did. ^^
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:23:09
You can't really be bad at mining, you invested and agreed to there terms bud. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 04:21:15
I'd hate to be that stupid. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:04:52
Somebody is upsetti spaghetti and didn't do there research :( 
@_date: 2019-08-01 14:50:09
It’s just a curvy swastika
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:12:29
It's a middle man payment system 
@_date: 2018-06-05 11:54:06
I'm not sweating.
@_date: 2019-02-10 05:43:48
YouTube is insane, and simple. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 05:40:43
Google is insane. 
@_date: 2019-12-10 04:11:36
What do you have that you don’t want them to do?
@_date: 2018-11-09 04:23:21
Oh boy 
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:30:13
Why do you need it hoss, sounds sketchy ?
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:30:49
@_date: 2019-09-15 18:13:24
I see this posted all the time, but I have no idea what it has to do with bitcoin. Someone explain?
@_date: 2018-07-14 03:20:51
Dang that's sick, I'd pick one up if it was $100! 
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:14:55
They did in "Arrow" the tv show as well. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:05:51
Google "bitcoin atms near (location)"
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:14:50
The mh/s is mining the more profitable coins. Gpu mining btc is impossible..
@_date: 2018-07-08 23:38:41
The bratva sent 70 million dollars worth of crypto. "Crypto" being the actual currency. It was kinda cringe. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:45:25

@_date: 2018-12-13 03:58:14
When did you start using the site?
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:11:30
He literally just told you how. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:18:38
Oh well. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:22:03
Oh boy
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:45:08
