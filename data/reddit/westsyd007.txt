This proves absolutely nothing. 
I hope it’s right though.

I had read some posts that said to expect major volatility in the days after futures trading began.

Talk to the rappers. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:09:43
Wow. I will try at my next given opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:08:42
Summed up well
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:45:34
Compared to the previous weeks and months, that is slow!!

As long as we know Trump and his band of steady, reliable, non-turnstile staff are on the job, we can all rest easy. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:10:31
Brilliant. Bravo, sir. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:47:07
I’m on the same drug. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:42:27
Yes.

I read an article a few weeks ago saying it was likely to increase volatility, but clearly many people are saying that’s not true and evidence this week is to the contrary. I’m good with that.

Dilly dilly!!!

I’m a white guy who works at a country club.... let’s just say rapping isn’t my day-to-day. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:19:02
It did!
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:46:42
Maybe not that soon.

I should have said, I’ll pay a damn good gardener to grow my tulips for me. I won’t care. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:56:14
Practically speaking, it doesn’t do you much good unless you spend it. But you can certainly buy big things like houses, vacations, yachts, NFL teams, etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:11:12
All fucking in.... and can I borrow some money?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:22:25
I never said everyone is getting rich. Where are you getting that? This is MY garden. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:54:45
Type in to google, tulip and bitcoin. See what comes up. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:04:23
Oh well done!
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:58:41
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:51:36
Agreed. Still.... I’ll share my crack. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:13:07
Could be....
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:22:50
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:57:44
You’re a buzzkill
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:31:48
That’s what I’m talking about. Don’t forget the tulips!
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:47:15
I’m all for it!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:58:14
You get to appreciate the pretty flowers. ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:01:10

Oh now that is good!! I think this should actually be Bitcoiner’s symbol, like how the Democrats took on the jackass as their symbol originally as a joke. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:13:18
I hope so!
