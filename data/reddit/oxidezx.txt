I feel cheated, went to Hamburg twice last year to see girlfriend and she never told me about this. I walked by it like 5 times.

8 or 9 seems like a good time to buy, but don't try to "catch a falling knife." Need to watch closely.

Lol well swift is just like ACH payments in the US, so not a bank.
The fed is evaluating projects related to the ACH system that will probably include blockchain tech.
Just because I work in the space doesn't mean I am purposely ignorant to the benefits and breakthroughs of bitcoin and proof of work. Was just shedding some light on what banks are doing.

I worked for a (now defunct) company that was developing a white label product to sell to the large bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase. We got a few of them to sign on as clients.
These companies don't make alot of money and their customer bases are small. The market as a whole is pretty small and there's alot of competition. So of course Coinbase is trying to stay ahead of the curve as they see it. 
It obviously didn't work out here and regardless of these kind of scenarios 99% of these companies are going to zero.

I work in the banking blockchain space. They don't have a use for trustless transactions - trust is their business.
They do have some good use cases for transaction / smart contract based shared ledgers, though it's hype right now that will die down by the end of the year.
Hopefully I get a few good projects in before that.

The craziest part is that it's actually just a hotel room and you can't live there for 30 days continuously or for more than 6 months a year because of the zoning. But you get the income from when the room is rented when you're not there.
source I used to work there and now I'm a NYC real estate agent

The status quo is not order, in this case.
