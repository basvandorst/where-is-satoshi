Wow, that's a very cool idea. Did you start it (it looks so since you're advertising it here)? Definitely going to use it some day.

I wasn't following news and don't know what has happened. So I assume that the creator of Bitcoin has picked a fake name to hide his/her identity, and there appears to be another man with matching name and that man has now been attacked for whatever reasons. Am I correct?
That's fucked.

It's a [jet trainer aircraft]( The reason I recognized it and laughed at it was that my country (Lithuania) had 2 of them prepared as attack aircrafts in our Air Force. One of them crashed after a mid-air collision with French Mirage (the Mirage had some rudder damage and was fixed and flying again soon after that) and the second one was retired soon after the incident. Now our air force has only six Mi 8 MTV helicopters, a couple of L410 Turbolets, three C-27J Spartans some ancient An-2 biplanes and a couple of old old Yaks left. Ordered some Eurocopters but it's still laughable. Well, actually a small country doesn't need to have a strong military, especially when we're a member of NATO, but it's still a bit funny. Our military in general is pretty cool for such a small country tho, the equipment is mostly outdated, but we have some awesome and great prepared special ops guys guarding our country.

Traditional meals in a local cafe, which I can guarantee is AT LEAST as fun as that restaurant with poor table etiquette (I saw the other photos of said restaurant).
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:44:39
There are way too many random altcoins. But dogecoin has surprisingly made it big. It was funny when it started and the overly friendly community sure as hell attracts some people. Then the help for the sportsmen to reach Olympic Games. I think it's not over yet. Some small businesses already accept dogecoin, so it has somewhere to go still.
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:47:24
Eh, completely different countries. Still, didn't expect a meal to be that much more expensive somewhere, when my country is cheap, but by far not the cheapest.
And McDonalds meals over here cost the same as all around EU. I don't go there, it tastes like shit and the amount of food you get by far doesn't justify the price.

Hello! Great to see Bitcoin spreading all over the world!
I'll just ask an unrelated question. How's life in Botswana in general. I mean from a position of a citizen. Is it difficult or easy to live there? Are you happy to live in your country? Is there any kind of entertainment/nightlife going on?
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:10:41
Well you don't need a house nor two cars to survive, so that's a lot of unnecessary expenses.
Minimum wage is around 330 USD per month. Fuel is $1.80 per litre. Well, I can't complain about the internet, as the internet over here is amazing.
But there are people living for $130 a month in here and that includes not only food, but getting drunk every day too. And they are not homeless. So people can survive with very little resources, I'm sure you don't need 70k CAD to support a family of 4 for a year.

Well, burning man is not the kind of festival I like would be more accurate.
Personally for me the best fest this year and one of the best fests I've ever been was a small metal fest in Lithuania. It did cost something around $9 and had mostly unknown local bands playing. There were only several hundred people participating but it had that amazing friendly vibe. The thing with those mostly small metal fests is that metal isn't quite popular and metalheads are a very specific crowd, so all the people in there share common interests and that makes up for an amazingly friendly atmosphere. I've literally never seen a fight in a metal fest.
[If you're interested, here's a promo video]( in intentionally broken English since the only people from abroad in there are a couple of bands. As you can see they're not even trying to hide the fact that people are going there only to drink and hear live music somewhere in the background. That's my type of festival, and I have to say that it's completely different to burning man.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:50:29
I'm the same way with dogecoin. I invested some into it, but it refuses to go back up, damnit.
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:29:41
I think we're safe for quite some time. Small criminals are dumb and will need a lot of time to adapt. They take your BTC card and asks for a pin code, you say random four numbers and beg them not to kill you. You lose 3 dollars for a card plus 2 shipping, and they spend some time putting your BTC card into a nearest ATM and trying to get it to work.
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:19:26
Great, now you can use Bitcoin to buy drugs!
Oh wait...

I'm aspiring to become a businessman, trying to sort my ideas and make them come true, so I'm always excited to see something like this. How's it going currently? Do you get a lot of publicity and users? This seems to be a great idea, pretty simple, but genius.

I don't think it will hit thousands of satoshis, as there already are too many coins. But I think it's real to expect 4 or 5 hundred pretty soon. I just need some more money to expand my mining rig, as the BTC value can increase too and mining might still be profitable. I'm willing to risk a bit.
@_date: 2014-08-19 10:30:04
These two are for this year's fest, you can find older ones. However most of them are in Lithuanian, so I doubt you'll understand much haha. But you could take a look into the English version of their also broken [website]( Kinda funny too, as the whole fest was.
@_date: 2014-08-17 13:00:41

I meet some people who don't even like metal but still frequent metal festivals because of fun occasionally. I also met one guy in a bus station waiting for the bus heading to one metal fest a month ago. He was very tidy dressed and appeared a bit nervous because it was the first such festival for him and he didn't know what it was all about. This weekend I met him again in another festival. He was wearing a leather jacket, all drunk, torn apart and dirty, running in circles while waving his penis around. Quite a rapid change in such a short time.
[Oh and this thing]( I don't even... I'm laying down the beer and heading to sleep now.
@_date: 2014-08-18 09:58:34
And damn, I generally love festivals and art. It's the idea of being stranded in the desert for a week with questionable art that doesn't seem very interesting.

Yes you could, there are several of them. But taxes should be lower when paying the airline directly. AirBaltic isn't all that useful unless you live in Baltic countries tho (I do).
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:32:57
Lithuania. Of course, that wouldn't be possible in our capital city (I'm talking about eating in public places, not buying groceries and making food yourself), but in my town there are a couple cafes and you can get a decent meal for 1.5 USD in them. Not really worth the time to make food yourself honestly.

$130 is our local social assistance. In theory it should be impossible over here too, but people manage to come up with something. There are plenty of apartments for rent basically for free in my town, because my town is pretty much dying, so you just need to pay upkeep costs.
Needless to say, people who live out of social assistance are the worst of them all, constantly drinking and so on. I've never seen a poor or homeless person in my country who isn't a junkie or drunkard. It's so easy to live in here, that every person with clear mind can make it.
I'm personally trying to get into web business, so it's going to be super awesome to live in here if I make it!

Yes. Computer hardware isn't very expensive, if you're building your rig for mining only. GPU is the only expensive part. Electricity is cheap over here, and a single good GPU gives you about minimum wage in my country. That is after paying for electricity, profit only. Two 7950s could give you average salary. That's nothing compared to, for example, American pay, but everything's so cheap over here, that you can live pretty decently. Now if you successfully trade everything you've mined, you can get some pretty sweet profit. Of course, computer hardware needs to be replaced eventually, so there goes some spendings, but you still earn money from it.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:15:22
Well, it's possible, especially if you live in a very cheap country, like me. In fact, an altcoin mining rig with a single GPU can give about the same as the minimum wage over here is. Pretty cool. Gonna give it a shot. If I fail, at least I'll get some experience in trading, which isn't too bad also.
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:43:11
