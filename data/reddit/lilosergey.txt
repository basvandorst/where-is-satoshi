You're right about problems with charge back. But this bot is not for enterprise use where you serve hundreds of thousands of random people vith various intentions.
There are 2 perfect scenarios for such a bot I see:
* use in communities or group of interests. E.g. I've been frequently asked by friends how to by BTC.
* integrate it with your e-commerce site. You send your customer a link to someone's else bot in format [t.me/someones\_xchange?start=]( Mr. Someone gets his commission fee and handles all chargebacks and other, you get your coins into your wallet. Please check this video: [
Basically those 2 scenarios I'd ran into forced me to make this bot.
PS. Sorry for my English

Thank you! Actually, this exchange is a part of more complex platform. I wrote about it on IndieHackers: [

Haven't tried Google Pay yet, but it should be working since it supports Telegram. If it doesen't - I'll include it for sure.

Great idea! I'll definitely think about it. That bot is made on the engine I wrote for another Bitcoin Telegram project, so I'll have to think should I rewrite it or open-source the whole engine.

All fine! Really thank you for pointing me to my error. I think it's the first time I used that word.

I am!
