Thanks. I know that much. I work in digital marketing and way back when, when it was (never) cool to use QR codes, we all had a couple scanners on our phones. However, they're not secure and typically store data/codes in a database. After searching about this, I know that people are highly recommending against using any ol' QR code scanner for this reason.
I keep getting an error with Blockchain's version. It thinks the QR code is an address and marks it as invalid. WHen really, I need to scan it for purposes of getting the bitcoin off of it. I checked and the Sartori coin is 100% authentic and loaded (they have a system to check each one). So, not sure what to do.

I have Coinbase and Blockchain. What my physical coin has on it is literally just a tiny QR code. I use the scanner in Blockchain and it produces and error specifically saying that the "address" isn't found. Hence me saying it's not working or the scanner is for a different purpose than I need.
I don't have a private key because it's just a QR code. Nothing else. I need something to scan the QR code and either produce the private key or import that private key from the QR code directly into one of my apps.
Do you have experience with these physical coins?

I thought the same. The person that gave me mine didn't pay that, haha.

Ok, I did end up finding it. It just keeps saying it's in invalid bitcoin address and takes me to the send screen. Hmm.

It seems they all generate a QR code for you to give to people so they can send you money. I cant seem to figure out how to scan a QR code that deposits the bitcoin into my account.
