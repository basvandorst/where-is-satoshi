Anyone got more of these cheap bitcoins?

Does it support the Ledger Nano S? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:59:43
TCP predates UDP AFAIR. And UDP has clear advantages over TCP especially in real-time transmissions. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:16:07
A question I also asked. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:15:20
That's a horrible fallacy. Bitcoin needs to be used, the coins need to circulate in order to be useful.
The "I'm gonna get rich fast" story is nice but it this is a side effect of bitcoin being useful. Once it loses this usefulness it has to adjust price.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:57:53
And bitcoin is not centralised? Lightning Network relies on payment processors that provide liquidity between individuals this does not look decentralised to me.
And to be absolutely honest: For a user that wants to use the tech right now it only matters if things work. Waiting 4-7 days for a transaction does not feel like the money of the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:10:48
Nope. I wanted to know if it has Ledger Integration like Mycelium. I don't want a phone app to be able to manage my complete portfolio without additional security, hence Mycelium and Ledger. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:33:21
It's called usage. Using a system yo to it's technical limitations is still usage. Some Altcoins have no issues handling that and even more. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:33:55
Yeah. Haha. I did another one with 776 satoshis per byte. Was a lot faster. Meanwhile I transect with ETH, LTC and DOGE almost instantly for a tiny fraction of this. This is a mess. I'm using and investing in BTC because I want it to succeed, I don't want my coins stored away on a cold storage until they become obsolete because another cryptocurrency was faster, smarter and cheaper to use. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:51:24
You forgot to also provide liquidity to the channel. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:35:14
Also known as fairy dust. Adoption rate is abismal. Also: Tell me how Segwit lowers my fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:30:58
Per byte you mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:26:25
Meanwhile my decentralised 366 satoshis per byte transaction took only 4 days. I really distrust Bcash but something is really broken here. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:43:31
What is the contribution of a read only node? Bitcoin is proof of work and a nonmining node does not provide proof of work. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:16:20
What is the solution then? Why can ETH cope with the massive tx flood and not suffer the same delays as BTC and let's not even start talking about fees?
LN does not convince me, this whole channel based lock in of BTC to have guaranteed liquidity... Doesn't sound right to me.
You're right, blocksize alone is not the solution and Segwit sure isn't also because we would have seen higher adoption rate.
I'm not an expert but I can see that Bitcoin is getting stuck and I'm not sure the direction the development is heading to is the best one. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:38:23
How much cost a Segwit transaction to be included in the next block. How much cheaper is it? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:12:34
I did. That's terrifying. The whole exchange business is what cripples  cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:03:49
Assertion made without proof. A Segwit tx end up in the same mempool as the rest. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:30:23
You realize that Segwit adoption rate is abismal? Coinomi doesn't support it, Jaxx doesn't, mycelium doesn't also. These are three very popular wallets for Android and exactly none of them offers Segwit support.
I don't think Segwit is the solution to the backlog and the high fees and other solutions may still be months away.
I want to use bitcoin, I want it to succeed and want it to work. If we don't use it it will be replaced by something else.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:14:12
Doesn't that raise the question about what's wrong with Segwit? Or what's wrong with Bitcoin? Segwit did not solve the issue (adoption is just one of the reasons) and the problem is getting bigger by the day.

No it's not. In theory they need to declare it and it would be deducted from welfare. And taking the Dosenpfand as part of welfare is dystopian given what the German System was 15-20 years ago. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:03:18
Neither did I specify and it really doesn't matter. It should be no part at all! Germany had a working welfare system that provided basic coverage. If collecting cans and bottles is now necessary to get by this is a shame. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:24:12
That was never meant as part of the welfare system! You'll probably don't understand but Germany had an exemplary welfare state.
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:38:30
Collecting bottles are now considered part of the welfare state? Wow Germany sure went downhill since I left 13 years ago...

Welcome to the neighbourhood. Barcelona loves bitcoin, you can even go to the dentist or have a hotdog and pay with bitcoin.

Bitcoin cash can only be considered a failed fork, at least for the start. Transactions should be fast (and cheap), that was one of the arguments they made. I waited nearly 5 hours to get rid of my bcc and here I am with a transaction that had seen 2 confirmations. Sorry but there are better altcoins than bcc... 
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:41:29
And you think that another altcoin mainly driven by a few powerful miners is decentralisation? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:39:47


That's how fiat works and you gave a beautiful summary why it works and why the same can be applied to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:43:04
All paid transactions are legit. There's no spam.

Purse.io might be a solution.

They keep the mining fees and they get your maintenance fees. They also don't stop mining because your contract runs out so you're basically giving them money they can use to purchase hardware, bandwidth, personnel etc and operate the business. Once the contract runs out you stop receiving money but the company has already earned a lot of money.
Oh and not all of them are scams. Make an informed decision, be aware that any investment in crypto may result in 100% loss and don't put everything on the same card.

Another strong argument for crypto currencies.
