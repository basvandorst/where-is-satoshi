And you continue dodging my question because the answers make you unhappy with your career choice.

How exactly would enterprise IT experience come into play when integrating money services (as well as dealing with all legal/business related requirements for offering such services) and cryptocurrency support into existing POS systems?
I can tell your subpar IT education/career has inflated your sense of self-worth. Please explain friend, how a valueless sys-admin would engineer or develop solutions to the aforementioned issues.
IT are the absolute bottom feeders of STEM (it should really just be called SEM so we could avoid grouping you imbeciles with us) and it reflects in your pay-grade/value to the company. Nobody has any respect for IT. You could easily be outsourced by some $20k/yr Indian at any moment.

Yeah, my suspicion that you have no idea what you're talking about. 
IT are the absolute last people anyone would call on for help regarding this. You literally can't even explain why you made that dumbass remark to begin with. Holy shit you're fucking stupid. Go back to college and study something real or ask for a refund.

You have no idea what you're talking about. The most expensive part would be getting individual state licenses to qualify as a legal MSB except Walmart already has those for their Money Center. They also updated the majority of theirs stores to modern POS terminals that support Chip+Pin as well as tap-to-pay and the potential for upgradable firmware to incorporate Bitcoin or whatever.
The real problem is as u/canyoubelivethisguy outlined. Nobody would use the thing. For the most part, real world bitcoin purchases are non-existant. The majority of transactions are on computers and the network couldn't handle any amount of traffic Walmart dropped on it.
