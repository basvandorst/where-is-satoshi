I\`ve uploaded the code &amp; a small description here. I also uploaded the 3dPrints to Thingiverse but it takes 24hours for new users to wait before they can publish their first thing :(.
Let me know if i forgot something or just ask if something is unclear.

Just ordered pizza with bitcoin. Was not able to pay with jaxx via bitpay. Then i used bluewallet and it worked. Jaxx is now dead for me ��
