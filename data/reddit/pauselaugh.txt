we're talking about the same consumers that think 1.99 is more valuable than 2.
I know we're all excited but you're talking about an adoption rate of fractions of a percent versus the full saturation of a matured credit card network built over decades. 
What you're describing "until the separation" is actually a residue of adoption, not the other way around. This will happen when more people care. Right now everyone that cares, knows.
Otherwise what you're describing is that merchants should be required to pass the savings on to you. They're not. Those creditcard versus cash signs still have the merchant profiting from the credit card fees by slight upcharging. Any savvy businessperson would know to say HEY ITS CHEAPER IF YOU USE BITCOIN so they can wean themselves off of credit cards and profit from the btc...

Official information? Ugh. I thought you were, you know, into bitcoin and decentralizing "official" sources.
It isn't hard to verify the data. Others have talked about this data previously but noone bothered to speculate or do a deep dive.
Know why? Because nobody who would theoretically punish gox understands 1% of this. There aren't internet forensic scientists trying to crack the mystery and bring people to justice.
In fact, I don't think its much of a mystery. At best, the specific details are foggy ... at worst, those specifics don't really matter, now do they, since even if you were to have bulletproof evidence, exactly what would you do to it?

But I don't think "the new wall street quarter and year for investing" really matters much. If it did, you could easily say bitcoin shit the bed in the last wall street quarter right before last year's investments ended... 
Both, in my opinion, are meaningless. 
It did crash last year, two major crashes in fact. We haven't seen any real newsworthy developments aside from yet more people willing to take bitcoin but noone really willing to give bitcoin for anything substantial and regular who aren't clearly profiting by exchange rates.
That is to say, sure some company might accept bitcoin. But it still remains to be seen who would bother paying exchange fees just to spend it somewhere... aside from those who've either profited off of exchanging it or early adopters.
Early adopters who have lots of bitcoins and saw them go from $0.03 for 1000 coins up to $1000 for 1 coin, btw, probably love it when the newest greater fool comes along to accept coins.
At any given point in time, the curious really don't see the point. As more and more people adopt, a larger % of people again only see the bad news and risks. They don't know enough about it, who does really?, to trust it not shitting the bed again somehow after they buy in. From 20BTC fees paid accidentally to hacked accounts to lack of motivation to use it. 
I loved the post I just read of someone comparing how much better it was to send bitcoin instead of wiring some piddly amount of money except OOPS they forgot to consider exchange rates and ended up losing money doing so. But shhhhh sweep that under the rug we don't want to scare off the next tier of investors in the pyramid that is build from the top down...

It isn't tax free. There are other taxes besides income, all of which are vastly more relevant.
Mining has nothing to do with "paying income tax when being paid with bitcoin."
If mining bitcoins is income, then that would make who the employer? The client? The mining pool?
"Magic libertarian internet money" is a good way of characterizing how the ignorant view bitcoin, and why they're in a hurry to regulate it as more and more people would prefer that to "King's gold official regulated blood resource" that they currently are forced to use under threat of violence.

The dollar was a stand-in for "fiat," as "the fed" was a stand-in for whatever centralized issuer / bank, so that bit of your post is semantics.
The second half, you're simply stating circular logic.
Yes, once bitcoins are used more then people will use fiat less. 
All of that is irrelevant until governments accept bitcoin in place of fiat, then gov friends who provide utilities. At that point you're paying a premium to convert to fiat, etc. etc. 
Bitcoin relies on fiat and when it doesn't it will simply have replaced it. If anyone truly thinks it will replace fiat without being regulated by government I'm not sure what world they live in.

'taxable events' are what matters, and those typically deal with conversion to currency, but if someone barters with you for livestock, say, what do you expect? To pay the government in livestock? They want USD.
look at the characterization of a gain there. 
if you want to take it literally, yes, you owe a % of any gainful trade to the gov, but they want USD from you.

Your explanation of ?? makes no sense. That flag was for account type. If they're high valued, they're all the same type. So ?? could mean "high value" but it is NOT "different clients."

I think the answer to your question is found in the title: "JUST LIKE BUYING A STOCK OR GOOD ISN'T."
Is having a stock income? No.
Is creating a scarecrow out of socks and poop jugs income until you sell it? No.
So why would mining bitcoins be income and not simply be the basis for establishing capital gain valuation? They're not the same thing.

This is not uncertain in the slightest.
You bought a coin at $100 basis and realized it at $1000.
Of course you're taxed via a purchase. Do you not think that'd be a pretty gaping loophole that "you're not taxed as long as you don't convert it first! DERP!" 
Euro bills are subject to other taxations due to being a foreign currency. 
You have to keep a record of literally everything you buy with bitcoin because you're realizing gains. It's pretty simple. Just like every time you get a paycheck or use fiat you're taxed.
The difference is that bitcoin swings far more wildly than your fiat probably does. You can see tremendous gains/losses in a matter of hours. 
People with basis of 0 realized 1200$ gains.

Shitty worthless post, except for the clarifying responses it generates.
The entire point of decentralization is that there isn't a single point of pressure, authority or failure.
Someone controlling 51% of the network becomes that single point of pressure, authority or failure. Since you're so creative to the point that you spend the time inventing nonsense, how about you apply it to the myriad ways a single entity controlling 51% of the network is a bad thing, even if they have good intentions.
Hell, even if that 51% is spread across in no more than 5% chunks, that is still a weakness.
Also, it isn't 51%, it is &gt;50% ... 50.00000000000000000000...1, if you want to get semantic which you apparently do. 
Also, I'm pretty sure it is an established fact that GHash.IO already took the network over and implemented double spends. It has at least been asserted as such with no response from them, because again, what is anyone going to do about it? 
Maybe they did it for good reason or to prove something. I know if I controlled 51% I would give it a try as well.
It is in their best interests to not do it? Duh, you don't know anything about them. They could be a government making sure they have a killswitch at the ready. They could be simply waiting to maximize profit or perfect the environment to sustain an attack. They could get bored as soon as their profitability isn't so hot and extort.... etc

This is actually good news and clears up a lot regarding usage. 
1. The first ruling states that, to the extent a user creates or 
“mines” a convertible virtual currency solely for a user’s own purposes, the user is not a money transmitter under the BSA
2. The second states that a company purchasing and selling convertible virtual currency as an investment exclusively for the company’s benefit is not a money transmitter.
These are huge rulings.
Localbitcoins was always illegal if you were running it as a business. Just as daytrading on an exchange was. Just as not reporting gains / basis on taxes is.
The good news here is if you sold coins on localbitcoins (or anywhere) you are not a "money transmitter" unless you are doing it at specific volumes or for certain reasons, ie, as a broker or for a 3rd party.
So yes, people need to stop playing Wolf of Wall Street thinking "Wow its so easy to just have a bitcoin business" without thinking the government is going to try and regulate you.
Doing it a few times for funsies is OK according to fincen guidelines. Doing it over and over again for consistent profit is a business.

No, it wasn't the 'whole point.'
Bitcoin could easily be the backbone of a globalized public transactional network, destroying the idea of private financial / transactional systems that can do things like obscure funds and recipients without an auditing process.
Imagine it this way, governments require banks to use something like bitcoin, with all addresses accounted for. Any wire transfer in the world happens over this currency and is traceable. 
So yeah, some tiny sandwich shop accepting it "instead of cash or credit to stick it to the governement and the banks" is so far from the point of bitcoin that it's obnoxious to hear "Hey guys my new Unsustainable Business Model now accepts bitcoin!" for the nth time, here.
I mean, have fun, whatever. But if it catches on the way it could theoretically catch on, people are going to wet their pants about any coin they actually used. 
This bullshit that "you have to spend it to establish value" is so laughably wrong and pointless. Just like the soft "its anonymous" bullshit that was spread initially and now eased off because of how obviously it isn't.
The revolution here is that the govs of the world are establishing their digital currencies to trace everything. Of course you have to make it a bit more illegal to find the "criminals" using it, eh? But only when the unwashed masses threaten power structures, as evidenced by banking domination that does way worse at way larger scales, way out in the open and then can write off the fines for getting caught as "the cost of doing business."

So, no. 
My first real "cost" issues had to do with maintaining of graphics cards that needed fan changes/upgrades/heat+power management. Losing a couple hundred dollars on GPUs that got damaged (without more tech knowhow than I care to have) was a real cost consideration. Dealing with sound of it running 24/7 was annoying as well. Running a GPU full boar 24/7 did have impact on power consumption as well.

It's meaningless, because bitcoins "valuation" is meaningless and arbitrary as it is relative to its value in USD. 
Why have the chart at all
The " Even these outliers still obey the rule-of-thumb that no merchant will adopt Bitcoin unless Bitcoin has the larger market cap"
The fuck? How many merchants in the world have a larger market cap than bitcoin?
Yes, great rule of thumb, not too many companies with a cap of over 12 billion dollars will adopt?
also your chart is bullshit, there were plenty of merchants thats "market cap" was higher than bitcoin, whatever the hell that means for any given online store, that adopted bitcoins early on.
Also, not sure why you link to 
for your bogus 15,500 statistic.
"BitPay ...has more than 15,500 merchants"
Basically, do some research. Were you even aware of bitcoin in 2009-2011? Your chart seems to start awfully late... at wordpress' accept date on Nov15,2012 and Feb 14,2013 marks the reddits beginning adoption, that means your chart starts in the middle of 2012. Derp.
And you make a rule of thumb while omitting 1/2 of bitcoin's life from it. All of the marketcaps of any merchant accepting bitcoin before wordpress were higher than it, I guess they didn't count?
Then you go on to talk about gox valuation when barely anyone in the world even gets that rate on bitcoins, compared to other processors and vendors. People like using it as a pure inflation machine because remember many people really entrenched in at gox are those who had access to bitcoins when they were worthless, and that cash value is just some pretend number in a database denoting a chain reaction of valuation. pump and buy-ups were and are trivial to orchestrate on gox. yet the next greater fool wants it to go up and takes part in it. Derp, i don't care what its worth i'll buy at its current value! 
You also extrapolate without inserting the idea that as bitcoin grows, there will be additional influencers that decelerate or accelerate the growth. Yes, if all things stay constant and based on a fraction of the data, all that's very true!

the first bit of your comment is obvious, but some clarification:
i'm saying right now, given the most efficient ASIC hardware, solo mining at 7GH/s is a loss considering its power consumption and a survey of typical costs for that.
I mentioned the cost of power, unless it is free for you it is a loss. Yes, perhaps you have ways to mitigate this cost.
The total network hash rate presents minor fluctuations at best, right now, it is a loss.
The bitcoin exchange rate does matter. That's why right now it is a loss. It would have to be about 25% higher for it to not be a loss on average.
The "cost of equipment" is irrelevant as to how profitable that equipment is. Mining was NEVER more profitable than just buying the bitcoins directly for 99.999999% of miners. Unless you were one of the lucky few to receive hardware on the cusp of transitions from cpu-&gt;gpu-&gt;asic, you were on the "get rid of the hardware" curve. It still isn't. People investing in some return on mining could just purchase those exact same coins. Same effect, yes? Thus, 'mining' isn't more accessible.
Regarding the coins being worthless, that has nothing to do with accessibility which is the main statement. You claimed mining is more accessible, I presented how it is clearly less accessible, then you bring up "well coins are worth more now."
There are plenty of people who "could have, should have" mined early. But they didn't, because the costs of electricity and breaking graphics cards and the basic uselessness of the coins outside of the interest in disruption and the theory of what they could mean didn't outweigh operating costs.
That didn't make it more or less accessible, that meant the value of the accessibility was diminished by the speculative costs/risks involved.
In short, if you have cash and you want coins, buy coins with the cash. That will be more profitable than what any sane miner or mining equipment company would do.
To pretend that someone holds a device or system that actually profits, and will sell it to you or give you a cut rather than use that device or system to profit for themselves is flat out mental damage.

Back in 2010 bitcoin was trading for less than a handful of your posts printed out, eaten, and crapped into a pizza pie pan. Maybe it is because, hey, it's a buggy piece of shit lets not go overboard with pretending its poo shaped gold nuggets
Kinda ballsy to have people burn real money on unproven shit, huh? Oh, but its totes "opt in," am i right or am i right?
The sky fell, it fell hard. Like Big Momma's House would fall.
And the community fixes fuck-all shit. "Anonymous hacker" steals from "shady exchange op" and somehow will "only return the money when its fixed" (it is already, no return). The exchange goes on when it is operating in deficit with no way of returning it, magically the fix is repaired almost instantly - like it was actually known in advance - and people sockpuppet the forums saying "waiting is best." 
All the community did was say "the whistleblower's story stinks like shit." 
When every scam to date waiting only benefited the scammers.                    
When my dad said "i'm going out for smokes" and never came back, that was to buy time, otherwise he'd have said nothing. But that would be suspicious and I'd hide in the flatbed of his El Camino under the tarp and would hit the road with him, into the sunset.

Bitcoin is easier to track once ownership is established, it's all right there in the blockchain.
As more people try to distance themselves from "dirty coins" futilely, the blockchain will resemble everyone's public, authenticated bank statement moreso than an anonymous ledger.
Cash, you can sorta/kinda track it, but only via entry back into the banking system. 
Paying a store with cash who then hands that cash as change to someone else isn't trackable....
....paying a drug cartel with serialized bills and seeing that that bill ends up in some bank in the USA only has the beginning and endpoints visible.

Could anyone prove that this is in fact what happened and not just innocent/incompetent "hey where'd my transaction go" coupled with automatic repayment attempts due to shitty, shitty code?
Then fuck off with these speculation threads.
The only information we've gotten is Gox claiming incorrectly that there was an abuse due to malleability. This was really their own shitty system ignoring well documented malleability. 
So assuming that this was an act of "hacking" and not just natural, automated failure over a long period of time with bad logic is assuming a lot.
If it was merely "hacking" they would know the answer by now. What are they buying time for? They could have 0 coins or most all of them. We do not know what their official story will be. We will not know how accurate it will be. The malleability "attacks" could have been cover ups, they were executed rather sloppily for such a find with so much potential take. Yet only one place has been hit so very hard, apparently.
On one hand it will certainly make the iron fisted attempts at regulation for our safety seem validated. Thanks a bunch, shitheads.

Otherwise, they could turn over the addresses that should clearly be accounted for somewhere and allow anyone to see where they ended up.

If everyone waited for the next person to use it as a currency, it would never have any value.
The story about the gorillion-dollar pizza tends to omit that the person that paid for it had many other coins that realized valuation due to that: bitcoins would not be worth what they are today without someone spending a gorillion dollars worth of bitcoins on the pizza way back when...
What all the sarcasm in this thread fails to respond to is that I can spend $$$ to get bitcoins. I can save some of those bitcoins.
But if I was going to spend USD at some shop that takes bitcoins, why not first convert that USD to bitcoin and spend the bitcoin? That helps the ecosystem out and helps bitcoin find valuation.
Of course those transactions fluctuate so much that I might end up paying a lot more for an item than if I had just bought it directly.
All the bullshit about "spending currency later because its worth more" is completely ignoring that bitcoin is still an augmented form of fiat for the vast majority of bitcoin users. They're still using "real money" to obtain or utilize bitcoin. 
I won't starve if I don't spend my bitcoin, that's what my 'real money' is for. 
The dollar has never gained value by simply holding on to it, it has only lost value as things get more expensive.
Bitcoin clearly has.

M'kay. There are so many analogies that can be made with how vapid your post is, but I think you're actually aware of them. 
How insurance works, various monetary/savings tools. All of them revolve around the idea that you're paying for something that's available **if you need it**
You want to be able to opt-out of it. 
Here's the thing, I don't pay anything extra for mine, and it works all the same. Any bank or credit card makes their profit from yearly fees or holding your money or debt and doing dirty things to it.
So yes, you want to opt out of a basically free service (value add service, really) or not sign up for the extra protection. Hooray for you.

"withdrawal of deposited cash"
It was pending. Most every bank has a window where the depositor can show a receipt to reverse the deposit.
This is why it is pending.
Did op say it wasn't pending, oh, no they didn't. Because every bank in existence allows this. There is no "deposits are final" rule, there is however a window of deposit removal when something is pending.
That's how every "verify the deposit" or "hold pending verification" scheme works. You don't keep those as they're reversed within the same window.

Oh, because reasons that have to do with valuation and not the actual utility of the counterparty idea? Gosh, but here I thought the valuation of XCP was related to the value of the transactions with it and not some arbitrary "initial price setting" that necessarily excludes everyone not within a 1-month window.
Bitcoin was CPU mineable for ~2 years where you would receive at least 50btc every week, minimum, for that 2.5 years with even a crappy CPU.
So cut your "fairest coin launch" cock and ball torture. I'm not on the same page as you with it. All of these shitcoins are retarded compared to bitcoin because of this simple timing issue.

A dark pool is basically off-market trading, sometimes literally off the exchange and other times on the exchange but privatized. Look it up on wikipedia. Imagine GOX buys 100btc and uses that btc to trade exclusively off market, with some other exchange, or with and amongst a private client base, meanwhile GOX is keeping tabs on the value of that dark market and uses their influence on the public market accordingly.
That is vastly different than having 1 interface where one group gets "preferential treatment" than another group. Bypassing security measures (that are supposed to be for investor protection), better latency (doing trades while sitting at the server and getting process priority) etc.

The idea that it is "all of those things" proves that the pre-digital, pre-internet laws are ridiculously narrowminded.

too many people in this thread don't realize the # of altcoins doesn't matter, the methods of initial distribution, the algorithm/concept (innovative or not) and the timing relative to the difficulty and hashrate on the network all set values dictated by the market.
Any new altcoin is completely vulnerable to &gt;50 attacks and basically worthless when push comes to shove, due to that.
Dogecoin saw success due to being gimmicky enough everyone hammered it right away and the network hasn't seen major threat of being overrun due to it. 
Other than that, coins are doomed to either &gt;50 deaths or they stay obscure too long and are essentially pre- or early-mined to the point that they're valueless.
Any coin that sticks around is good for the ecosystem as it gives different price points and valuations.

escrow always requires a trusted 3rd party. You can't remove that. Obviously if the goods are 100% digital and its qualities are not subjective (condition, nature) you don't really need escrow, just a protocol. bitcoin suffices excluding the fact that most interfaces are 3rd party to it.

But your assertion that there are 0 people who used bitcoin without following up with a post about it is obvious bullshit. I've used it, but I'm at "infinite profits" so far so really the only issue is trying to use it when I won't completely regret not waiting to use it.

occam's razor = they are not lost or stolen.
there is proof tracing previously "proven" gox coins, and how they've been sitting in an address for years. The simplest explanation is that **THEY STILL HAVE AND CONTROL THEM**
They could easily prove otherwise, but they're not going to because perhaps there are legal ramifications for doing so, such as criminal negligence, fraud, etc. 
They're going for bankruptcy protection so I'm assuming they'll have to prove the coins were lost/stolen eventually.
Is the beauty of bitcoin that you can't do that? Well, then I guess they get to enjoy a nice retirement.
Maybe they'll invent some shell company and pretend they made all these new bitcoins, just like other scammers do, when really they're just trying to make it legit that they have the previous stolen funds. We see that over and over again. And if you call it out or trace it, its easily explained as "well the people who stole it must have coincidentally invested here."

What? So Bitcoin mining pools pay out incomes? Is every person on every mining pool going to receive tax information from their pool?
Oh, no, its that they don't understand mining and passed arbitrary rulings based on that misunderstanding.
If mining bitcoins is an income event, then purchasing anything is.
You cannot conveniently separate the concept of converting fiat to electricity in some cases as income and in others as not, just because of the type of software you're running.
if i use my computer to go on eTrade and trade stocks, am I generating income or merely organizing assets?

One thing that I wouldn't keep bringing up is that Satoshi "writes differently" than Dorian S. Nakamoto, therefore D.S. Nakamoto is "not Satoshi."
that is a fallacy.
D.S. Nakamoto could have easily been involved with a team surrounding Bitcoin. His name could be the one used on the paper. Multiple people could have ghost written. He could have developed things "secretly" and had people write the papers for him.
If it was a team of people working under a pseudonym, just because one of them has the same name as the pseudonym.
Now that has no bearing on how he should/shouldn't be treated or if he is/isn't involved.
But "bad language" works both ways. He could have said something that was ultra revealing when he didn't mean it. Anyone growing up in a multilingual household knows this happens with the weaker language all the time. The intention was to NOT REVEAL the full truth except lack of specificity of vocabulary makes it reveal far more than intended. Yes, it could be the opposite where something said isn't meant and exaggerates unintentionally.
In the Newsweek article he is quoted as telling the reporter "I'm no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it" while deputies are present.
this was claimed to be true by the deputies present. 
Now that's a pretty specific thing to say about bitcoin when you claim ignorance of it. Was he referring to bitcoin? To the conversation? "I'm no longer involved in that" is quite revealing.

It's not PayPal, guy. It's the fact that paypal allows chargebacks and you cannot prove anything about the coins receipt / exchange. 
Even if you miraculously could get someone to agree to do it, there'd be no way for them to attach their recipient address so the blockchain would be verified, to paypal. They have no incentive to add it because not only are you potentially running an illegal money exchange business (they give no fuck if you can or cannot prove it) it is against their TOS if you aren't.
Are you new to reading TOS of services you use?
So yeah, complaining about paypal is like complaining that your local bank won't let you sell bitcoins in their lobby.

But you shouldn't. There is only guidance and suggestions as to how it will be treated, nothing "official."
Even this post punts on the question of mining, which i think is a fuckton more important than its Question  position. If you mine, how much do you owe when you sell? And how is that provable, anyway?
The laughable part is the supposed ignorance of the us government on bitcoin yet they're going to suddenly be sophisticated enough to parse out everything you ever did with bitcoin? And make subtle distinctions of what it means to have mined it versus bought and traded it at a loss, etc?
So yes, all of this asserts it is a capital gain of some sort, but as soon as you go into "its like manufacturing" that's 100% bullshit because last I checked you can't just set up a money manufacturing business without getting all sorts of RICO act destroyed. There are people who have done this.

@_date: 2014-02-12 22:39:43
Consider any thing in the world.
As it becomes harder to obtain, and there is less of it available, if it is actually useful it will increase in value.
If, however, it becomes common to obtain, less useful as other technologies become more convenient or capitalize, then it decreases.
So nobody knows which direction it will end up.
What is known, is that we're entering into the next steps of anti-cash 100% digital money. If you care about valuation, (do you care about fiat's valuation?) then make a bet on if it will go up or down.

I think they meant, "it is not the only thing to do with profitability."
But those points are obviously assumed regarding typical use-cases. 
Yes, if you get a newer jalapeno for free and pay $0 electricity in your dorm, you are getting $0.20 a day worth of bitcoins. 
Now, find me somewhere that you can actually pay $0.20 a day for ~7GH/s. You'll find they don't exist as that would mean you, and the company, are just breaking even and nobody is profiting... even though it is useful to the network.

In what little defense they have, most if not all publicly rentable servers are in no way secure enough to run an exchange, bank, or whatever.
Any datacenter stupid enough to allow that to happen without liability waivers are opening themselves up to exchanges "getting hacked" and suing for damages while just keeping the coins themselves.
Irrelevant to what happened here - i've called my host randomly and gotten amazing security, other times zero security - but there are reasons why banks + important financial institutions are hosted privately.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:34:10
Of course mining gets more and more expensive for everyday people. 
7GH/s operates at a loss compared to anything except free electricity.
10GH/s barely returns a profit.
Mining is not as accessible to anyone as it's always been. Get in early enough, and you're grabbing 50 coins every few minutes with almost any modern CPU. It is bizarre that you'd think it got more accessible, or stayed that accessible.
Investing in a company is the definition of LESS ACCESSIBLE. You are relying on paying someone to mine for you because you can't. You hope they're not a scammer, using the processing for other means, etc.
Chipping in on someone's operation costs as a shareholder requires someone to trust someone else. Mining yourself does not.

its a lot more convoluted than that, it doesn't end at $5...
with your "rewards card" dataset, they know how to change prices based on who buys what. They know how to market and target you based on your demographics.
Using a rewards card might increase your costs at that store much more than the immediate savings. 
To put it another way, the store makes more than the $5 they gave you at the cost of your anonymity.
The way I'd propose it is that you are selling your demographic information and purchase habits, adding it to big data, for $5.

Nobody "forecasted" the spike to gold's value or even the april bump. Now suddenly there are lots of experts doing a lot of forecasting.
spoiler  if they KNEW it was going to happen, they wouldn't announce it. They would buy quietly as much of the sub $5,000.00 orders as possible to maximize profit.

there were a few as have been pointed out, but they were basically impossible to implement without a built in escrow system.
that is the side-effect of a non-reversible currency... doing business anonymously requires a bit more than just throwing up a website and putting numbers next to someone's names for all the good transactions (that you can't even verify are real) they've done.
To put it another way, imagine how much of a shitty cesspool eBay would have been in the early days if it was with bitcoin instead of fiat.
as much as people like to crap on paypal, the paypal/ebay integration was basically necessary for it to work right.
Otherwise, craigslist = what you're looking for. all the auctions are buy it now (or trade)... see if they accept bitcoin. The problem isn't "that accepts bitcoins" its the "and also accepts paypal, visa, other payment methods" that would hold a bitcoin ebay up from mass adoption. if you don't care about that, sure, bitcoin only.

merchants also have to register and pay fees to bitpay/coinbase. 
bitpay and coinbase also trade WELL UNDER mtgox prices. It would be like "well a dollar is worth $1 but actually when you use a dollar its $.95"
there goes anonymity. there goes the valuation. It is more expensive to use those services than visa.
easy example: $1000 item. To get $1000 of bitcoins is more expensive for the purchaser. Unless you have an account at mtgox you're never going to see that valuation, in the US it is illegal to trade at mtgox anyway. So that number that people throw around is bullshit. The mtgox high is irrelevant for the vast majority of US customers, look at the bitpay/coinbase valuations which are 5-10% under.
Then, to get $1,000 ignoring these fees and upcharges, you pay $1,000 and receive X bitcoins. You go to use $1,000 of bitcoins to get a $1,000 item, and oops, the value of bitcoin dropped 1% temporarily. Now you can't use it to purchase the item.
This revaluation can occur in the time it takes you to load up the interface after the agreement on price.
So then you have to buy more to 'cover' volatility. You have to make an investment to make sure you have enough, which then holding this new coin fluctuates wildly again. All to purchase something you are pretty firm on the agreement of.
Imagine it the other way. what if you were walking around a store and the prices of all of the items fluctuated based on the value of bitcoin? Visualizing it that way makes it easier to see the issue.
Never mind that over 2 years the prices would have changed 25,000% of course.

The idea is once that "becomes a realistic problem" someone will build software or an interface that solves it.
You're predicting futuristic problems while conveniently omitting that in the future there will people people trying to solve them and solving them successfully.
Essentially you want a piece of software that can work with a smartphone to scan multiple products somehow and compare their prices.
That seems completely trivial and isn't something that should be "bugging you about bitcoins."
What bugs me about the banking industry is they truncate, floor and otherwise round-down decimals past hundredths in most applications. But when it comes to their internal systems they track way, way past that. Clearly skimming those left overs in the name of "simplicity for the end-user."
This is really clear on various portfolios you can see they're tracking it to the billionth...

not everyone "pays off their mortgages" with bitcoins, only early adopters. Someone bragging about it only reinforces it as a ponzi.
don't be at the bottom of the pyramid holding the bag, make sure you get all your friends in on bitcoin! that way the value goes up!
The point being made was that talking about the future potential of something like it is a foregone conclusion is basically assholeish, especially when the "everyone used bitcoin" portion is utopian at best. 
Right now, its people who mined / bought low and selling high "paying off mortgages." It isn't a bitcoin-based economy, bitcoin isn't even a drop in the economy no matter what EXCHANGE_BOT_A loop trading with EXCHANGE_BOT_B spikes the trade volume up to be.

We can now theoretically turn lead into gold, it's only cost inefficient but not impossible.
Maybe a bitcoin trillionaire will spend a few billion to convert lead to the equivalent of a fraction of a penny of gold for funsies.
From an energy usage standpoint breaking bitcoin meaningfully could happen with quantum computing, could already be doable with military top secret tech for all we know.... But in terms of which is more likely to happen first, with known tech lead to gold is doable now but expensive vs future tech computing which will be more pedestrian costwise but may not in fact break anything.... Though it should.

Again, since my other post was downvoted, the correlation isn't there, and we're going to hear a lot of tales of martyrdom when the wild west of bitcoin caused the mean, old government to shut down otherwise "legit" businesses from operating in the US due to not-fully-thought-out laws.

Uh, why do you paint such a rosy picture of it for merchants? Are you one?
You pay fees higher than credit cards depending on your exemption status / bracket and exchange bitcoin lower than market value at exchange when going through the 'easy vendors.'
And if you don't go through the easy vendors you risk immediately losing profit anyway. 
The largest issue is of refunds and returns.
Someone pays with X bitcoins then what is my return policy? Cash that I don't have because withdrawals from those companies aren't instant as is pending transactions via major credit cards?
I won't get into all of the taxation and exemption statuses that may/may not apply when various govs decide to clarifying heir position on how this will be handled.

how do you run out of a number on paper?
say the world is 10 people. we each get 1 btc.
Then 5 people mysteriously die. that leaves 5 people with 1btc each. the only thing that changes is the relative labels of value we put on objects, tasks, jobs around us.
If before it cost .1 btc to get fish from the fisherman, when 1btc = 10% of the worlds economy, now 1btc = 20% of the worlds economy so adjust the price of fish accordingly, more or less than .1btc based on: 
1. did the fisherman die? is it harder or easier to get fish?
2. do i personally make more btc now or less?
3. is it harder or easier to work in this new world?
4. amt relative to world currency total
etc. etc. etc.
it would be silly to think it goes up based only on the fact that total # of coins changed, is the point. there are a lot of factors involved.

it will eventually have to level off at
no. of bitcoins / no. of people in the world drawing income = no. of bitcoins per person. 
number of bitcoins per person = $ salary person earns a year
you can see that the only real basis for 'leveling off' a worldwide digital currency is ~$1M per 1 bitcoin if you plug in numbers like assuming how many btc will be mined at any given point, how many people have access to bitcoin, what the equivalent in bitcoin is.
I worked it out to somewhere around $850k equals 1btc if you assume 21million bitcoins for the # of people who have an income and a smartphone right now. Imagine if all fiat was replaced with bitcoin. each person on the earth would only get a fraction of 1 bitcoin ever, on average.
When you expand that to 'any internet access' or 'salary and are supported by government or retirements' it goes up even higher.
Anything else is pretend speculation. That's the nature of a highly divisible thing, as soon as people want a piece of it you can split it up into smaller pieces easily to accomodate.

Nice but anecdotal... You take it because you're willing to accept the risk. You'd be dumb not to have stopgaps in place to prevent shouldering bubbles, right?
Think about an institution that's in bed with the mean old government. Even if they accepted bitcoin tomorrow, what do they do with it? Pay for additional storage and security? They need fiat, not by choice but by how their entire capitalist ecosystem functions. So they trust which exchange with their livelihood again? 
And when they receive a certain amount of bitcoin and convert it ASAP, the volatility is flat out lost... It is impossible risk and any reputable institution.
It is laughable to  disagree with the idea that less risk comfortable institutions wouldn't touch bitcoin I think the number of web capable transactional institutions privet his easily.
As risk goes down more will adopt.
It will be pretty obvious when business are risking LOSING business due to lack of bitcoin acceptance. That's the tipping point.
Long story short, the businesses that are relevant to the discussion are those where it actually matters what they accept. I work for an institution where we couldn't accept bitcoin payments without a way to immediately convert it to fiat. Anything that takes $1 and potentially makes it even .95 is a devastating loss that would mean the end of the institution.
I've never seen THAT addressed, just all this money manipulation bullshit in the guise of user experience attentiveness.
Spoiler alert: simple math is bitcoin adoption and ultimately reliance could destroy your business. Everyone can talk all the shit they want about fiat, but right now its number one trump card feature is stability followed by convenience as a close second.
People touting bitcoins potential convenience as being more than modern fiats current convenience is nice and all, and going the populist "poor people can now trade money internationally ignoring that whole internet desert and computer nonexistence or I dunno maybe the fact that most don't really need to?" route is great....

I currently have 600 usb miners powered by a modified gas-powered lawnmower motor running 24/7 megahashing so in about 2 years I should break even if the difficulty doesn't go up too much and then I'll have infinite money!
then i bought about 10 bitcoins worth also 
the way my friend explained it to me is that when i paid him for the address that lives in his wallet, its like i purchased a gold vault. My address is secret to only me and protected by malware bytes (not pro version)
please donate to me, he gave me a vanity address:
and here is my private key for verification that it is my ownership

what if buying is from 'mysterious stranger' and selling digital leaves a footprint that only proves sale and not purchase?
Good luck proving things in that case? 
That's the part I'm not clear on, seems like there'd be an awful lot of unresolvable small scale cases where 'some dude I met randomly hooked me up without a paper trail'
My point being, if it is break even do you report it as:
1. Paid for x in cash I have no proof
2. Sold x for what I paid for it, have proof
3. So I owe nothing we cool? Cool.
Seems like that's my only choice. And any investigation would result in the same thing unless they (I) do a manhunt for random dude I met in a computer store to verify?
Or is it "too bad fuckface since you can't prove where you got these from and how much you paid you owe us for the provable sale as 100% profit."

No. You really don't know how franchising works, huh?
All they did was say "True Story" verifying it. They're not making a OMG SUBWAY SAY BUY BITCOINS bullshit like gets blown out of proportion so easily with pumpers. But that's what caught on. I know its super cool to be the libertarian freedom squad but sometimes the term "revolutionizing" doesn't work when you're applying it to a mega-corporation that wants the opposite of revolutionizing.
Even verifying the story, however "hey it generates buzz over our imitation of food" worthy it might be, steps on the toes of the franchising agreements that subway makes with credit card vendors. On one hand the franchisees are able to make decisions about those things, on the other there are perks and benefits granted by preferred vendors, pre-built packages, group deals.
When your processor catches whiff that someone's gone full retard and decided to equate the "new scary future" with the past that still rakes it in hand over fist - and pays well to maintain that privilege - you better believe that someone at corporate got a phonecall threatening to have subway credit processing in the fucking dark if they kept it up.
I wouldn't be surprised if that franchise owner suddenly started feeling a squeeze from above for straying too far from standards. I don't think they'd do anything out in the open until they formulate a wider strategy, but hey, at the end of the day the tweet was deleted.

That doesnt make sense. Of course the money used for the miner prevented an investment. You didn't use that money to buy coins.
What's so hard to understand that any company giving away money making machines at a loss will simply never exist? If it was more profitable to mine they would mine and not give you anything.
How hard is it to understand that this is what happens:
You hand them cash, they immediately buy bitcoins with your cash while they've been mining the whole time up to shipping.
Those who handed them cash way back when allowed them to purchase ridiculous amounts of btc and infrastructure to keep the scam alive.
So they have btc/cash and have been mining with the hardware, you have a machine that will likely never recoup the cost that now requires maintenance and attention to maybe recoup in a long long time?
There are very few points in btcs history where buying a miner or two for small scale personal use was more profitable than just buying coins with that cash. This isn't an opinion, it's a fact. 
So the point that 'anyone losing while waiting for a miner' is vapid... 99% of miners lost/lose.

if you replaced all of the money in the world with bitcoin right now, magically, you would still be disrupting the need for credit card company gouging transactions.
this would cause some effect as they'd need to get their money from somewhere, and they have a lot of money to impose with.
one thing to remember is anonymous transactions benefit those in power just as much if not more than those not in power.
so while we're all talking about the empowerment of the average person, we're not seeing too much public discussion of what it means for those who have all the 'evil fiat.'

Yes, its not like computer science is predictable or anything.
the only reason this logic looks so genius / amazing is the pure tonnage of bullshit that armchair crypto, computer science, economists dump out of their mouths on the few outlets we have.
press is riddled with inaccuracies and terrible analogies. people hear mining and they try to make analogies out of actually mining gold ... ugh...
of course if you have a vapid grasp of the concept and try to extrapolate the future from it, it only grows in vapidity.
Versus understanding things from the outset and extrapolating problems from that dataset. Do you really think it would be difficult to model exactly what happens? 
It isn't exactly that hard to work backwards from the maximum potential value of a bitcoin simplyas the total wealth in the world / # of bitcoins = value of bitcoin and say "at best we end up here, realistically it will be less, but it will certainly be more than 0 once it catches."

Your article should be deleted not only because of the sources, and that its blatantly original research, but because you do things like this:
"This layer has the responsibility of maintaining a balance in some cryptographic money (like Bitcoin)"
There are 15 other mentions of bitcoin and 'other things like bitcoin.'
That would be like talking about "ways to rehydrate yourself by drinking things (like Coca-cola)."
...completely tangential.
Compare that to 
which states:
Technologies like Tor and Bitcoin have enabled online assassination markets as described in parts one to nine of " Assassination Politics".
That is essential information.
It is actually relatively easy to write this as an article, published, and then cited in the same exact wikipedia page, removing the heavyhanded bitcoin references of course. That's the flaw in wikipedia. It requires "sources" to appear credible but the judgement of what those sources are. 
"Some guy said this in this publication" is OK, even if that guy is you.
"I'm saying this" is never OK.
There are celebrity profiles of minor, small celebs that make it through on merit that someone else shows how noteworthy they are, even though the article itself is basically a puff piece. That's what you need for this: get the idea out there, put it on a website as original research, and if it sticks and is used by others eventually it will be absorbed in the page.

meh, establishments that do this are one or more of these:
1. just lazy and don't want to handle the additional layer of payment. this same place wouldn't handle bitcoin for the same reason. 
2. cheap and don't want to lose any profit at all to a service that their customers find convenient. simple math: do they lose more money accepting credit cards or turning away customers? notice they say 'credit cards' but that isn't the same as debit card, duh. 
3. are skimming cash for tax purposes or avoiding taxation by underreporting profits. 
So nah, I don't think bitcoin solves any of those problems unless they're willing to risk not using coinbase/bitpay/whatever and can shoulder the volatility. tax entities will know exactly how much is running through their account. so there goes  There are costs: training, infrastructure. Someone cheap isn't necessarily going to go for 'less expensive.' so  is out. And lazy, well, there is still a second layer of infrastructure involved. it is a bit more direct than credit/debit systems but requires that extra bookkeeping.
So, no, bitcoin doesn't help this situation USUALLY.

The issue is just getting it out there is valuable, but executing it to promote its use is different than a minor presence for us.
We don't benefit by the internet presence since we have that. And our outlets would have click here to donate via fiat next to anything bitcoin related, because why would you limit digital fundraising to such a narrow channel?
Do you have a QR code for paypal donations for those who wouldn't know where to begin with bitcoin? Do you change your message to explain or include this new technology? Do you offer support for it or is it another "sorry we can't help you?"
I completely understand the 'we accept it because why not' with minor investment, but that lack of investment leads to a lack of support in our case. Infrastructurally why not accept every alt coin and precious metal, products etc.
Same thing happened with social media. It was never 'let's do social media because why not its fun' it was years of staff cost analysis, marketing and signage modifications, media management training and restructuring, equipment and maintenance...

You can call late adopters whatever you want. They can be whatever political affiliation there is, that does not change the fact that the use and policy of the Bitcoin protocol and software is basically libertarian in nature.
You can even posit that the forces behind creating this were not libertarian. But that's what they made. 
A conservative or liberal or whatever can politicize it, regulate it, do whatever they want. it doesn't change what bitcoin is. You can claim that the "people" espousing political agendas will be "drown out," that doesn't change what the software itself is.

Bitcoin is essentially Credit Card Company A.

Govs don't need to stop bitcoin, they just need to stop people from being able to use it. 
Go take a look at the cease and desist bank letters posted here, the hearsay phonecalls from investors that say the banks are going to come down on it. Am I misunderstanding that?
Or is that a huge mistake for a bank to cut accounts and freeze assets when someone is suspected of dealing with bitcoin, the anti-capitalist, pro-terrorist child rape coin? They'll be sorry one day when this miniscule amount of people get a nuke dropped on them in the form of the FBI party van showing up to make an example out of them, effectively scaring the rest away?

anything can be purchased "with bitcoin" if you convert it to other means. I can trade bitcoins for apples and use apples to lure, feed and ride a horse and win a horse race and use the winnings to purchase seventeen cans of beer, get real drunk and throw myself through a plate glass window, sue the building owners, settle out of court and use the winnings to buy a fleet of jetskis, perform tricks on them at air and water shows and say
"I purchased an acrobatic jetski business with bitcoin LOL donate to me and tell your city we accept bitcoin"
The idea here is that league of legends simply accept bitcoin and then you don't get raped on 'transaction fees' and 'markups' along the way by 3rd parties undervaluing bitcoin while providing an 'essential service.'
Otherwise, guess what you can use to buy things in LOL? Yeah, the same thing you have been.

 is a great primer written by a lawyer. 
with bitcoins, when you convert to fiat did it touch a bank account? if so you're flagged. How do you prove "loss?" The burden is on you and if IRS sees +$10,000 in your bank account you can't say, well i uhhh withdrew $20,000 over time and invested but then lost it all. 
It'd be up to you to prove where the investment came from. If you can't, they'll tax you / fine you / party van you.
It's pretty simple actually. its up to you to report everything. if they see fishy money coming in its up to you to prove how you got it.

I don't think they're going to release how much money they make off of overdraw fees, that would be more fuel for the revolution. The polls you read are probably grossly low.
I know what I blow on "out of network" atm fees and how much they've made on overdraw fees. I'd say everyone in the USA put together hands the bank pure profit in a number big enough that it would rouse the rabble.
to put it another way, the fine i get for going -$ is way way way more than they're losing for not being able to reinvest or risk the money of mine they're playing around with. 
That's the point of the fee: they're using our money to reinvest. When they tell their investor they have $5 but I overdraw so now they have $-1 that is the entire basis of "bad credit" that caused various meltdowns. People reselling or investing on loans.
Another way to look at it, is that you're essentially giving the bank a "loan" to be paid back any time you demand it, when you deposit into checking. When you magically make them pay back too much of the loan you're bound to owe them more.
The real bullshit is how $-1 somehow lost the bank $20. Nope. It's arbitrary and not bound by any math.

In 2011 the price peaked at $30 each. If you had extremely bad luck and decided to dump it all at a peak that barely lasted any time
$40,000 of bitcoins at that price would have been 
1,333 bitcoins 
You would have "been a millionaire" when it hit 750 two weeks ago.
I don't believe you would have invested in it at that miraculous "high peak" window, in fact i don't think you could have since as soon as it hit that mtgox was ddosed. 
So lets say you weren't super lucky but got them at 10-15 each.
4000 coins would have been 1M at the 250 mark, which you could have hit in april, or in october.
But of course the plot thickens, you had to sell some at some point. Mkay! 
Still, how many are we talking. Bottomline that $1M when it hits 1K = you have 1,000 coins now. given this mystery amount you're referring to, you would have sold off 300 at some point to 'move' which seems dubious at best.
tl;dr: COOL STORY BRO
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:44:54
This is not true for any BFL product that you could have received in October, even if you paid cash for it when ordering them.
Everyone knew they were pre-ordering a product that didn't exist yet. The bullshit was that:
1. when they didn't exist, you were paying for them to implement poorly designed asics  
2. when they did exist and were used for 'mining' for months while profitable  
3. they hid behind vague language "we hope to be" etc for over a year. All 2012 preorders were supposed to be shipped by april. 
4. their website and banner ads were misleading, nowhere on them did it say "preorder"  
5. they continue to deceive with their various products. have you seen the email that they will ship by christmas if you order today? LOL. It somehow magically sped up to release weeks of jalapenos day after day until suddenly they were all caught up for every order of them from june through november? Laff. Sorry, that's obviously an electricity cost analysis judgement, where its cheaper to use the same electricity that would go to jalapenos on other platforms  
They sell "right now" a $1250 25GH/s machine all of a sudden. Do the math on how profitable that would be, it never will hit ROI. Even if you had this in hand 2 months ago it wouldn't hit ROI.
And then they post dumb shit on their blog like:
"I love this job. Reading customer emails is a hoot. Today a customer blasted us because we "mistakenly" sent him a miner that was over-performing--hashing faster than we had advertised. And he actually said this was proof of our incompetence. Some of our chips are just hashing faster and we have to ship them anyway. So I apologize to all the customers who received a unit that exceeded expectations. I was unaware that this would be a problem for any of you."
Yes, it does show their incompetence in that the entire assessment of valuation of hashing and joules per second were all arbitrary and bullshit. The incompetence that Jody is glossing over is the fact that someone's order from when the slower models were shipping actually ended up being a 'faster model' shows that they had zero intentions of shipping the earliest models when they could have.
When a friend ordered his model, he should have gotten the slower version. 8 months pass and he receives the newer, upgraded version. Spoiler: THIS MEANS THE SLOWER VERSION WAS NEVER AVAILABLE TO HIM. Having 4-5gh/s in April is a fuckton better than getting a 7-8gh/s in october. but this shitheads don't care, they try to appeal to the retards who buy into their shit.
But yea, clearly someone's mad that they got a faster model. Hey fuckface, its that if they would have gotten the slower model SOONER they would have made more money mining with it.
Its obnoxious shit like this and their toilet bowl / shilling customer service where you can blatantly see them with multiple accounts giving each other circle jerks about how awesome they are and how fun it is to solve and tinker with broken shit (rather than actually performing any sort of customer service) that makes them scumbags.
They used this soft con to deceive everyone who was blinded by the simple truth that selling a money making machine is only smart once it doesn't profit anymore, otherwise YOU'D KEEP THE MACHINE TO MAKE MONEY.

no, if he was paid in $X bitcoins and they go up to double the worth, he is taxed on double the worth when cashing them out ON TOP OF regular "income tax."
If they decrease in value he can report a loss but that will not cancel out regular "income tax."
Getting paid in something 'like a stock' is far more complex than getting paid in fiat.
So no, not "exactly the same income tax laws apply." They only apply at the point of being paid. But when bitcoin is actually converted to fiat, the government doesn't give a fuck that you were already taxed on it.
Thus, more complexity and not the same. It isn't established if this changes if he actually uses the bitcoins on goods/services and not on conversion. Right now people assert the law states 'no.'
but if we're talking about 100% of someone's income and assume they have to pay taxes, rent, utilities, bills in fiat... then conversion happens and you're double taxed.

while your assertion is correct it is a useless one.
yes, the probability of someone adding 51% of the network goes down as more processing is added.
but the more processing is added, the higher probability that pools collude to become the 51%.
We're going on 'faith' that some of the larger pools don't simply merge. 51% is not needed to perform a 'greedy pool' attack which will snowball that pool well over 50%... while I don't think btcguild will go that way, i can't say that ghash.io hasn't already abused their network to test double spend capability (this has been publicized, judge for yourself).

The  issue, and pretty much the only issue, regarding taxation is when you convert to fiat and a 'legit business' has enough information to report you. Or you overdid it and your account was IRS flagged by default.

I disagree. There were only a few hundred thousand people who took part in the gold rush. For even 1-10 of those people to become insanely rich due to striking gold is not insignificant.
Relatively, what is the equivalent of that 1-10 striking it rich via the gold rush versus the hundred thousand that did not? 
how many hundreds or thousands of people that are going to get rich via bitcoin mining / early investing versus those who will eventually adopt ahead of those who don't exactly opt in to it in the long run. Is it 1-10 in 300,000? That seems very low. 
Another issue is that you basically got zero ROI on the gold rush unless you really struck it rich, it was all or nothing with few cases of someone finding "a little gold." You can still mine and recoup your investment. 
A lot of the FUD regarding mining seems to tout difficulty and hash rates while ignoring things like, oh, the value of what you mining spiking to 2-3x what it was a few hours ago. 
This is obviously because the mystery variable is what a BTC will be worth...
Speaking towards the "gold mining" analogy, I still believe it to be flimsy because bitcoin generation is predictable in the short term. (assuming long-term = technology adoption, etc) The valuation of what is generated is not. Gold mining generation was not predictable.
Nobody bought a gold mining rig and suddenly due to how many other people were mining their rig was capable of generating less gold. Nobody bought a gold mining rig and due "gold generation rate equilibrium" suddenly generated less gold. 
It is flimsy to say "its the same thing because in both cases people invested money on generation schemes but then didn't get their money back" or whatever. I can say that buying magic:the gathering cards or baseball cards or comic books is the same thing as bitcoin mining. I'm "mining" garage sales and flea markets.
You're not going to get 0 bitcoin with even a simple usb asic miner. You might not ever make the investment cost back, but it just isn't the same as investing all of your livelihood and generating 0 for it.
I don't disagree that it is a safer, potentially more lucrative setup to offer the cottage industry or supplemental marketplaces surrounding bitcoin or mining. People running exchanges are set to make good coin, I suppose. But more than the top miners? Nah. And equally rare. 
But I'd love to hear more about the legit bitcoin fueled businesses that don't work on pseudo- investment timing fraud or outright theft that are making people some good coin.

the same could be said for any token. the reason why drugs + assassinations stick to bitcoins is that it is a new, more convenient, more obscure way of doing it and that any crypto (xbt being the most prominent) is REQUIRED for these markets to exist.
you can't tout the obscurity as a benefit to only the things you want visible when the obscurity clearly works for other reasons as well.
Think about it in terms of surveillance. If I go into a store to deal with cash, there are dozens of points of surveillance and verification systems that link me to the store that I had to pay in cash with. 
There are also dissimilarities. Marking or tracing bills can't happen the same way with bitcoins. Bitcoins themselves aren't serialized as with cash. You can't counterfeit bitcoins. There is no physical exchange required with bitcoins as with cash - via mail, courier, dead drop, whatever. 
It is gross, convenient oversimplification. Read the papers on "assassination marketplaces" they can only exist with a solid crypto currency backing them. Same as an online drug marketplace. You can't run those on cash "the same way" as you can with a crypto currency. There is no "bank" for an assassination marketplace, no overlord "holding the pile of money."
To argue that you don't want the things that bitcoin enables to happen to be brought up is a level of obscurity that makes enforcement and regulation focus on it. To out these things and discuss how they are now possible due to this new technology will speed up the resolve of the problems. 
There is nogovernment that has played their full hand, at all, yet. Just some tacit approvals. You can't fine and punish without building a big enough case, right?

The bullshit behind this article is that it's a  "bitcoin alternative" ... this thing has nothing to do with bitcoin, something like bitcoin would be one small part of this proposal.
Chase is proposing that their network run as the equivalent of coinbase+bitcoin+their current infrastructure.
They don't need to fucking patent bitcoin, they could just download it and use it however they want. What they're going after is the b2b and b2c system in its entirety.
Look up the patent and what they're proposing to do. It would be the equivalent of patenting "going to the bank."

It is meaningless, in that it is a vapid oversimplification of one vector to 'prove a point.'
The graph doesn't extend earlier to when the price was stable for a long time and prior to the amount of coin produced via mining halved. AKA, the graph is a convenient cooking of data to support the thesis.
Speculative bubble is bullshit, it assumes that transactions are some sort of constant and indicative of usage. Completely false. Throughout most of that graph, satoshidice was flooding transactions since it was gambling on the blockchain. That's largely tapered off. 
Since software has matured, less transactions are needed, it used to largely require additional steps: Send 3rd party coins, 3rd party sends your coins to someone, etc. Now you cut out 2 or 3 transactions from the process since the tools have matured. Is that accounted for at all?
The number of transactions has only increased over time, due to more vendors accepting coins. The number of miners receiving coins has only increased, adding to the number of transactions. The number of people purchasing coins has increased, again only adding to the transactions.
These charts are bullshit. They assert that 'more people were transacting when bitcoin was cheaper.' This is just completely fucking wrong.
The only chart you need is to see # OF TRANSACTIONS. Not "divided by value" or "based on worth" or "times the number of pirates with a pegleg in the world."
This is the chart that matters:
Claiming it is speculation bubble because the ratio of transactions to what bitcoin is worth is lower is hilariously useless and obscures that more people are using bitcoin, more people are hoarding it, more people are playing with it on exchanges.
But OK, I guess 2 weeks after the peak # of transactions in history of bitcoin its time to get clever with charts to ascertain its rich white people investing in bitcoins mostly? Big fucking deal.
Yeah, i don't recall last year any people using bitcoins at all to shop for christmas/thansgiving/black friday sales using all of these various, easy methods of doing so. Derp.

Keyword = exchange.
Market changes rapidly, it's more useful to be able to act on fluctuations and exchange than it is to transfer, wait for approval, then act.
That simple benefit to the end user allows exchanges with completely terrible security and functionality to prosper, people fixate on the benefits without realizing (out of naïveté, ignorance, or stupidity) that the risk is huge.
Also with bitcoin itself being a mysterious unknown risk, it feels natural that the pseudo shady dealings with the mysterious site have that risk.
For true widespread adoption this will demand authentication and oversight. The nice thing about bitcoin is that authentication and oversight is purely opt in (for now).... The paradox being that zero interested parties for large, long term capitalization will maintain the deregulated anonymity.
Bitcoin going regulated / authenticated is equally natural to ebay/amazon/paypal going truly anonymous. That is to say completely nonsense.

I disagree. That's more annoying because it makes the losses seem worthy of discussion as a foil to the hype surrounding the gains.
Every transaction that happens has two people:
1. a person who thought it was a good price to buy at
2. a person who thought it was a good price to sell at
as more people weigh in on what those values are, of course the price will fluctuate in either direction.

Undersea cables getting damaged isn't really a fixable weakness with bitcoin. The solution there is different/more connectivity.
It's like saying a car is weak because a road might turn into lava and melt the car...
It has nothing to do with "how economics works," it has to do with asserting the valuation of bitcoin is necessarily tied to something. If we assert that bitcoin replaces currency 1 to 1 then the endgame valuation of bitcoin = 21,000,000 / (number of people in the world) = average income per person. That's roughly estimating 1 bitcoin to be worth millions of dollars if you assert what average adoption / income works out to. 
The point I was making, which I believe to be valid, is that the actual valuation of it could be used RIGHT NOW to replace currency and you'd be making exactly as much as you make now, except with a bitcoin symbol next to it versus whatever your fiat symbol is. We are caught up in assessing the value of 1XBT rather than the realization that it could simply replace currencies today if everyone agreed to it and be a superior system than the current fiat system.
People speculating as to how adopting it earlier makes them "more rich" later is missing the point that it is a successful system if they stay "the same rich" or don't use it as an investment tool.
That's the irritating part of keeping an eye on its actual valuation. If you map out the potential endgame and perpetually wait for it, it is worth such a massive multiple of what it does now, you hold instead of spend and you slow down the inevitability for personal gain later.
store of value and tradable commodity as it is are at odds when people only care about it as a wealth multiplier, and not the underlying system it offers.
on one hand we want to encourage use by touting how easy, important, vital it is. on the other end you get "lol i made 3x my investment" obscuring these other ideas and having people shy away when they think it is at its ceiling.
When you bring up the economics, the simple idea of "divide all the money in the world by 21,000,000 units and divvy it up based on adoption/income" is its valuation, that ceiling is ridiculous and gets in the way of actually using it now (unless you have so many that it doesn't matter either way).

Ugh, circular argument. Right now it works for businesses that have a small, marginal amount of bitcoin that don't rely on those sales to hit a margin.
For businesses or institutions that need 100% of their revenue generated immediately and without any risk, it is simply impossible. To those institutions paying credit card fees is trivial, potentially written off by taxes or funded by government anyway.
In a plot twist, the one saving the money here on institutional use of bitcoin is any given government who is currently footing the bill for credit card payments... probably not the taxpayers.
So hmm, that savings isn't capitalized on immediately. wonder why.

But is that really an innovation or a predestined necessity?
"Aside from the bravado of 'govs can't do anything'" meaning it is bravado to think that ... They're doing a pretty good job of narrow channeling growth in certain jurisdictions because they're compelled to. In others that are free it's either due to lack of awareness, of disinterest, or tacit approval. To put it another way look at the surges when government gives a silent nod...

"This chart shows a dramatic reduction in the total number of transactions, irrespective of size,"
This is useless for many reasons. Transaction amount means nothing. 
If you chart the total amount of bitcoins that moved day by day, irrespective of dollar value, the chart doesn't support the thesis.
Also, why does the graph start at 12/13/2012, you ask?  The blockchain halved at the end of november is why. Lets see the graph extend to when people were mining 50 per 10 minutes. Again, this graph doesn't support the conclusion.
You need fewer transactions to add up to more money. 
1 transaction at 1000 is 100 transactions at 10. Ignoring that is fucking pointless.
This guy just drew pretty - arbitrary - pictures using no real basis.
The joke of this is that the dollar value is not derived by 'transactions' it is derived by exchanges that obscure the number of transactions. I can put $100 in an exchange and make 10,000 bitcoin transactions within that exchange. This is not accounted for at all.

2. ebay 0 feedback usb miners for the best deal -&gt;
3. receive miner in 3 months -&gt;
4. start mining by running extension cord to street light transformer for cheapest electricity -&gt;
5. pay for personalized vanity address and private key by running casino toolbar plugin (need to turn firewall and virus scanner off or else it blocks it from working, malware bytes is ok) -&gt;
6. print paper wallets out, but take photo and put on instagram and pastebin as what is known as "code storage"
7. set half of them to solo mine if you solve a wallet block on your own you get all the coins 
8. and  other half of them to a pool with zero fees and an domain name from a different country. those countries allow you to mine without paying taxes because they're not in your country remember to use the same login and password as your private key or they will not be able to send your rewards. 
9. do not report anything as taxes because thats the point of this, its 100% anonymous. thats the "intrinsick value" being able to deep web anonymously as long as you're using the torrent network and behind proxies.
10. i like using public proxies from official .gov email list, you know those aren't hackable and keep you anonymous

People behind the scenes - and who aren't retarded enough to dredge this stuff up - confirm they are two very different people, that satoshi is likely a group and by being a group any lead as to "who it is" is obscured across multiple identities.
first bitcoin transaction was between hal finney and satoshi.
January 12, 2009	 First Bitcoin transaction, in block 170 - from Satoshi to Hal Finney.
he clearly states it was the first "btc to cash" transaction. which if bitcoin is working as intended is completely unverifiable.
he was in school for crypto. you do things like "read the crypto mailing list"

You make an educated guess as to where you believe it will end up, then you influence the markets as much as possible to push them there.
The only way you're nervous when you "buy in" at X and then see it drop under X is because you don't have a realistic stance on how it will one day be &gt;X.
I know people who were just as nervous as you about buying in when it was $1 each as "bullshit, who would ever pay $1 for one of these."
I also know that once you study the math about it its max potential without assuming population spikes or income changes is near $1,000,000 each in the ultra-long run. 
Governments haven't played their hands yet. It is not surprising to me to see a huge dip after one does. Now we wait for other relevant governments to weigh in. 
It'd be like micromanaging your retirement funds. You can, I suppose, but really once you consider it a long term investment you just wait.

$1,000 investment at that point would be worth millions now.
I too thought "lol bitcoin" at that point (i'm a 2010 CPU miner) but not so cocksure that i'd say ITS DEAD BYE BYE or whatever.
Its easier to see the endgame from a 30,000% change versus when it made some random, hard to understand traction (since there was literally 0 ways to use bitcoin at the time) going up then crashing. At that time it was easier to say 'bitcoin is worth 0' because nobody valued it.

In which alternate dimension is bitcoin cheaper?
exchanges cost money. volatility causes risk. added time = money lost.
Handing someone $10 or paying by my credit card is far cheaper than bitcoins are for the vast majority of the fiscally privileged world. We can say that it also causes gross slave economies, is inaccessible, and privileging the wealthy and that's a separate discussion.
But when I pay $10 to get $9.99 in bitcoins due to fees and it fluctuates even more due to volatility, that's pretty good incentive to not spend the bitcoins versus waiting and hoping its value gain covers all fees.
In the long run when monopolistic banking is diminished due to the decentralized crypto, yes, bitcoin is far cheaper. Not exactly going to hold my breath to see the "savings passed down to me" but that's the concept, right? Stop needing to pay transactions as expensive as CC companies require?
Even if Shitball Bricks &amp; Mortar adopts bitcoins tomorrow, its going to be quite a while before the idea of bitcoins lowers the cost of goods, if it does at all. 
What's more likely is that banks and the forces that monopolize credit card gateways will make the profits by jacking up other, required institutions. Other rates will increase to make up the loss of their stranglehold on % + fee per transaction.
i do love the sentiment that these power holding companies are so monolithic that they must fall, there was plenty of agility (or history of power + wealth) that got them there in the first place. If they were so easily ousted, it'd have happened by the bigger fish by now, and has repeatedly in other industries.
I'm gonna go with "the king's gold" being a little bit harder to steal.

this is so excruciatingly false it shows you have little understanding of economics as it relates to a government and tax funding.
Are you saying that governments can't curb adoption by disallowing institutions that live on tax dollars to use bitcoin?
That they can't say: ok, virtual currency tax is 50% so if you want to register as a legit money transmission exchange you have to report all earnings or we shut you down?  Or simply add an "if you accept bitcoin" tax?
Or are you asserting that the bitcoin power elite will cover all funding the government pulls due to a currency threatening its power over the financial profiteering of a country?
Think of every non-profit and charity losing its tax breaks and government grants / loans / stipends.
Sorry, but accepting bitcoins would not make up for the loss in just the tax-exempt status for the nonprofit i work with, let alone if they pulled other types of funding. We can't accept bitcoins because we'd actually lose on the transaction costs (which for non-profits and gov. funded are basically 0, not so with bitcoin exchanges) and we couldn't risk the volatility anyway. 
So all of this "the gov can't do anything" is pure nonsense. 
Know what the gov can do? Is never open an exchange that offers non-profit rates and tax writeoff management. That would make it basically impractical for most non-profits to bother accepting bitcoins (why, when its at a loss?) Sure early adopters tap in to the 'hey everyone lets validate bitcoin' in its early stages...

One problem is that people aren't grasping that 1 bitcoin is not the lowest unit available.
to me that would be a good reason to never use "bitcoins" as it reinforces 1 bitcoin as this sort of base unit.
Also, I don't think bitcoin has a plural, without again referring to or adhering to that idea that 1 bitcoin is meaningful.
Third reason:
The plural of gold is not golds. Silver isn't silvers. etc.
1 ounce of gold doesn't become 2 ounces of golds.
1 bitcoin shouldn't become 2 bitcoins
The problem is this stupid name "coin"
1 gold coin DOES become 2 gold coins
Again, its this terrible idea that a bitcoin is this "1 physical entity" like a coin. Bad name, always has been.

Actually the main argument against bitcoin is that it is unclear if bitcoin itself will be the endgame or if there will be some sort of fork or v2.0 of bitcoin that will, diminishing this "valuation" of bitcoin 1.0 dramatically.
The bottomline is though the valuation might change the impact and the concept is never going away.
The worst part, and the signature of the OP being "stupid" is that it leads off with $800 as some sort of judgement of if it can succeed or not.

the transaction fees will be much higher than the actual reward for finding a block far before all the coins have been mined. 
Essentially think of all of the transactions that can be potentially be stuffed into a block, how cheap a block will be, etc.

When you use the bitcoin for anything you trust the other side will give you what they promised. Once you give them the coins you will not get them back.
When you give someone something with them giving promise of bitcoin payment later, you trust them to pay you later. There is no authority watching you to make sure it happens. This is no different than fiat with one key exception, you have less legal recourse with bitcoin currently. Good luck suing someone for bitcoins. Fiat or fiat equivalent of bitcoin sure. Coins themselves? There's no way of making someone pay.
In other words you're the one that's wrong.

1. surefire way to make a quick profit ... nah
2. its not "an investment"
3. your basis comes out of nowhere. what rationale do you have to say that you would not invest in bitcoins? Every early adopter who held their bitcoins saw a 20,000% increase. That's a lot better odds than 'winning the lottery.' If you bought in to bitcoins at any time prior to 1 month ago, you would have seen at least a doubling of your investment. Every. Person. Again, not the same as your terrible simile that makes no sense. Not knowing the odds in russian roulette is the same as investing in something? Derp.
4. you mention nothing about it as a b2c or b2b device devoid of "valuation" this is because you know nothing about it except for the valuation.
5. you mention nothing about it as a proof-of-work system
6. i'd say: zero chance of chargeback, public ledger, rapid 24 hour transactional system, decentralized currency, miniscule fees, accessible to all without any 3rd party involvement, infinitely divisible currency, largely anonymous, opt-in to regulation are all pretty important features that you skip. because discussing those would disprove your shoddy thesis. There is obviously a real world utility to a public, uneditable, ledger that is a proof-of-work. Perhaps you are too ignorant to know what it is?
7. first you say "With Bitcoin however, there is little that is left to chance." Then you say "it is as useless as it is risky." Risk implies uncertainty. Make up your mind. Furthermore, if you believe it is useful - which it is easy to see how it is useful - then your statement means it is not risky. Derp.
8. most importantly: jheri curl is the proper spelling.

Don't mean to get specific, but I think this example applies to a lot of people and would like clarity:

I then bail on bitcoin selling the 5000 btc at $1 each.
What am I responsible for tax wise? If 1 year passes, 2 year passes ... If it is $1 each versus $1 total worth versus $10k total...
I think that covers the vast majority of what people have done, buy from somewhere and sell it, sometimes at a loss or break even point.

except for the adventurers who actually struck it rich and bought their own chains of farms and toolmakers, right?
The big difference here to an actual mining scenario is that the odds are actually relatively tiny that you buy a miner and beat the entire rest of the mining power to "strike gold" and solo/small pool mine versus the various gold rushes (california wasn't anywhere as big as canadian and alaskan gold rushes fyi).

this is perfect - not only are the original questions unanswered, the answer is some sort of libertarian fantasy island ignoring the complications and issues rather than solving or addressing them.
to actually answer the question:
yes, training staff is expensive. and trusting staff is risky if you're not using a transaction software / interface.
but mitigating risk requires you to use a processor that negates you 'holding' coins anyway. so accepting it requires no additional training or paperwork. it's no different than accepting a credit card payment, except your payment ends up in your bank account indirectly rather than through your processor into the payment queue/tablature, etc.
You're greatly exaggerating the 'costs' involved. It would be close to zero investment to accept it. Just try it for a while and see if it works. 
If you can shoulder the risk, hold the coins rather than use payment processors. But when you do that, you then do have to invest in a bit more robust technology to accept them, and essentially trust someone to maintain, secure and manage it.
The short answer is there really isn't much else past that. Yes you could see increased business due to accepting it. Yes if you hold some % of coins you could see a huge profit. Yes if you hold some % of coins  you could see a loss. It really isn't that expensive but if it feels like it is, then the benefits of bitcoin in the long run (those "money in the hands of the people" arguments) aren't really grabbing you.

when people say 'weak hands' do they mean people who buy low and sell high instead of holding forever and ever and never selling?

Even if there are 2.161million addresses holding "something" that number represents so very few people.
Look at the number of transactions at satoshi dice (1dice) addresses. Sending a transaction to one responds with a transaction. That transaction has a huge chance of using a new address in your wallet.
"I know people" who have 3,000+ addresses due to satoshidice I would assert that if you were to group the addresses the largest chunk of them are "this address was used due to receiving something from satoshidice" would be the vast majority.

The risk is the issue, as chuckaeronut said, +/-10% a day volatility is not "acceptable" when going -8% ruins you completely.
As much as I want it to succeed, the discordian in me wants to see it plummet to kick all of the "we accept bitcoin" get-rich-quick folks square in their nuts and have them howling in failure and ruin.

those of us just holding on or watching it catch on slowly and hopefully the proof-of-work nature slowly seeps into collective consciousness as people struggle to validate their investment once it plateaus...
gains are nice, but they shouldn't be the main driving force or required by any means. I'd love to see it drop to $50 and a nice 5 year plateau to weed people out. I believe that would encourage growth.
But I also think there are a lot of people treating bitcoin as an investment who are willing to dump a lot of money to keep pumping it to max their profits until they get bored and cash out.

You said fail.
The only way bitcoin fails is if it goes away.
Smart people realize that the actual valuation of a bitcoin itself is IRRELEVANT so only listing things that change the price point while not diminishing the protocol's utility is nonsense.
You'd also realize no altcoin can surpass bitcoin simply because there isn't a lull in awareness curve ramping up difficulty and being matched by hardware. Hardware that's available can 51% pretty much any new coin that doesn't force premine or start with a huge pool...
I mined coins on a CPU at a fast rate. Multiple every few hours at 50bitcoin each. The tech that one person has and isn't making a dent on the bitcoin network could destroy a currency immediately.
That's why the CPU driven currencies are becoming more popular, but their valuation is so low at best they have years to go before additional tech boosts that mining power.
The main reason is that whatever their secondary or tertiary functionality is, bitcoin solves the problems mostly "good enough."

I can tell because it says:
12 Month Term
Choose from 1 GH/s to 100 TH/s
Somehow I don't think 1GH/s = 100 TH/s = $10.83
If so, I will go for the 100TH/s choice :|
Never mind the fact that $10 would be recouped in not even a few days/weeks. Meaning, why would they sell you this power instead of using the power to sell bitcoins.
Think about it. 
If you had a 'bitcoin generator' that generated profit for running it, why would you generate less profit by letting someone else pay you for it?
The idea here is to mark it up because you'll never buy a rig, and they're essentially profiting off of NOT running it. Otherwise, they'd just keep and sell the bitcoins themselves instead of essentially selling them to you...
Another way to look at it is that you're signing a contract where they sell you bitcoins at a certain rate for a year, no matter how shitty and low the # of bitcoins you get per day ends up being, you're locked in to that rate.
To think of this as "you're renting a miner you don't own" is what they want you to think. Simple to see it as "you agree to pay us for X rate of generating bitcoins a day at Y rate, for a year." Baaad.
Essentially, whatever the cost is, you're 1000000000000000000000000000000000% better if you just use the cash to buy bitcoins. They're not running a charity. They're suckering ignorant people who can't do the math. 
The only way this becomes valuable is if they are selling you the coins at a rate you cannot buy them for elsewhere. say they have a direct connection to undermarket coins because they buy bulk or something. I highly doubt that, because again, why would they do all this if it were to break even or lose???

He mis-explained  how "blocks are solved"
starting at 12:30...
"in bitcoin it would take a typical computer years to solve a block, where it takes the group of computers 10 minutes"
This ignores how difficulty works, something that is commonly misunderstood.
block generation = 10 minutes
difficulty = based on processing power of network, increases as more power is added to equalize generation to 10 minutes.
A fleet of asics as 100% of network = 10 minute blocks
A single CPU = 10 minute blocks
Single CPU + fleet of asics = CPU rarely solves, is small % of network power.

This is exactly the problem we currently have.
We can't fix or disrupt the system because the people with money don't want it to change.
If a superior XBT fork comes out, "respecting balances" is far less important than using the better technology. Because again, who cares about the valuation but those who have an agenda?
If it is so noble to disrupt supposed corrupt money systems, some other crypto or a new bitcoin system should disrupt itself to make improvements. But it will of course receive static from those who "bought in" or really care about its value more than the value of the system itself.

Since their population is 20% of the world, is when?
Asia is 3x the population of America+Europe+Oceana. So, yeah, I'd say their adoption rate is much more impactful than the rest of the developed world.
You say you use bitcoin to buy stuff, but the only way it is feasible for a vendor to accept it is using a service that immediately converts it to fiat.
Those services require 100% identification of that vendor. So it isn't anonymous for that vendor, stripping one of the intrinsic benefits. There are also fees, but they're less than other credit card fees. 
The governments have not shown their hand yet regarding these transactions. I work for a non-profit that cannot risk accepting bitcoin until it is declared how accepting bitcoin impacts potential federal funding and taxation status. 
IE, many people donate to non-profits for tax exemptions. They cannot maintain this AND anonymity. We cannot accept them and claim tax exemptions without proof of receipt. 
The realization here is that a lot of the "trade with anyone, anywhere, in the world, cheap and anonymous" is not a concern for most people in the world. It is, however, a larger concern in China where their policies are vastly more strict than elsewhere.

Bitcoin has been proven as a proof-of-work system.
All this bullshit regarding it as a value is meaningless, unlike as a store of value. "huh whats that" says anyone looking at these cool charts.
What if the stability asserts that bitcoins are worth 0.0000001$? This nonsense about "growth" and "number of adopters" is an inevitability at this point.
It is bad because people's entry point has nothing to do with the intrinsic properties of a bitcoin, and instead the arbitrary valuation that dipshits spending it to buy nonsense and claiming its sooooo revolutionary to fight credit card monopolies because they allow the service and product monopolies to profit more?
If you think credit card transaction savings are going to translate into cheaper products LOL, more like paying for the gas in the yacht of the elite.
But please, lets hear more about how valuable bitcoin is because someone PAID CASH TO SOMEONE ELSE to get bitcoin and then use it to buy something worth more/less than their payment, because it is such a revolutionary product the volatility is a mark of excellence.
all of the shittiness and venom that we apply to the current money monopolies will eventually be passed to those who "got in at the top" ... its just a new money ponzi defended hardest by those who adopted earliest, when you think of it in relation to whatever fiat.
when you consider it an earth shattering globally coordinated basis for proof of work and value signifier, that's better.
But you don't seem to mind that "vested interest in its success" when it is at a pump stage equates to "bitcoin is scam ponzi" when it deflates. I know I don't. But say that to some jerk that actually bought at $X when it drops. Oh wait, its never ever dropped yet its got such a huge multiplier. No losers so far, right? Sure, I've read the posts of how each weak hand deflating is actually strengthening the stronger hands. 
But this entire weak/strong bullshit dances around what's actually happened by fixating on some arbitrary judgement of who's more relevant to it. Laff.
That is to say "LOL I GOT IN AT $100 NOW ITS MORE THAN THAT" is harmful to anyone who uses it later. It establishes a relationship that is irrelevant and when people feel they've missed the boat they're not understanding the purpose of it anyway.
"Getting in at the right time" is irrelevant. Using it and acclimating to it is what's important. except, oops, where are any services that are worthwhile for it? gyft? turn dollars into bitcoin into cards? why not just buy the fucking cards with less steps and actually less cost when you consider how many intermediaries are taking a cut? For innovation?
Oh wait, I know, it can be a new way to donate? laff... completely unrealistic for any institution and actually a point of weakness for government intervention (we will not give you tax breaks, statuses or funding if you adopt the anti-treasury currency).
but yeah, lets pretend its all about buying low and selling high. suckers can't even see how much market manipulation is going on. exchanges operating at seconds - minutes lag? huge discrepancies in multiple exchanges that are exploited by those sitting at the servers? 
Do you think the people running the exchanges have to wait months to get verified at other exchanges? Or is it more realistic that they get their own special API? Again, laff...

terrible chart.
 is a proper innovation curve diagram.
as a technology reaches its peak usage, that's when it becomes the most lucrative for people to iterate and innovate, and a new technology is born. That repeats until that technology his a series of innovation plateaus that essentially look flat.
many times, the in-between technologies are short lived.
A. phone -&gt; B. video-phone -&gt; C. webcam 
it is insanity to think that usage of a dominant technology decreases when an innovation is replacing it, you still need to use A when B is getting popular because you can't exclusively communicate with B. Likewise A+B to C.
There will never be a point that 1/2 the people use fiat and 1/2 the people use bitcoin. That's utterly laughable.

First of all, not everyone's miner is still 'working to recoup investments.'
So the assumption that 'mining has ballooned too quickly' is bogus, do you know what % of the network has already recouped their investment and is mining at a rate much greater than the cost of electricity (which is 0 for many)?
So I don't get what miners you think are operating at "large losses" or who "can't afford to stop" but I assure you there are plenty who can afford to run their rigs for hundreds of years without seeing anything resembling a loss.

You could EASILY file a police report to get the camera footage from when this happened.
Something tells me you don't want to do that.
Maybe the bank will. Maybe you're hoping the bank doesn't bother.
The "smelly bullshit" involved here is the vast majority of fraud is someone using card number/credentials remotely.
This is because few people are stupid enough to go to a point-of-sale and perform illegal transactions with cameras on them that are all timestamped. if it was the cashier working alone you'd see them doing it without someone present (gosh how'd they get your pin).
So lucky you, you've got a dumb criminal performing authenticated crime? Sorry, this is a wet dream slam dunk police case where they pad their arrest rates by going to the security footage at walgreens.
I love how you ask if the cashier was in on it and that your card was "skimmed." what does that even mean? Somehow they knew your PIN number and entered it all manually without a swipe? 
Nah, this sounds more like you bought money with your card, then called fraud on it to get back the money AT BEST.
At worst you made the whole thing up. You told your wife to meet up with a localbitcoins guy to get cash? LOL. 
Your wife is some sort of wizard. Did she have the stranger explain how to "send the coins" in person? They just met when you were asleep? 
Lets see the transactions to both "mysterious stranger" and your wife. Pass along which reputable stranger you sold to. I'd like to sell to them as well.
It will definitively prove your story.
1. the timestamps on transactions would have been in the past
2. the address would be traceable to a "reputable stranger" easily once we know who it is and can establish a rapport with him.

First of all, insufficient funds has many meanings:
number1 is that it could be the person has "not enough money" in their account, not that they're overdrawn. Say a checking account has a minimum balance of $100.
if you have $50. They fine you for not 'having enough money.' so now you have $30.
number2 is that you have no limit but are overdrawn. Past $0. So now they fine you for having less than $0 and you have less than that. From, say -$2 to -$22. 
The biggest problem with this is that it skims from the folks who that "small" fine is actually a big deal for, to pad the wallets of the ultra rich.
I am middle class enough that I can withdraw money from any ATM without really caring about extra fees. It's a luxury to not be poor.
Of course, to someone who handles their business properly, this isn't really an issue no matter how steep the fine is as a % of your income or comfort zone. But that isn't to say shit never happens, and when it does happen, fines fuck up the less fortunate more.
I guess it would be "hard" to know someone's income status and fine them based on a % of that, huh? 
Shit is unbalanced now, in the name of liberty trumping equality. Most winners don't seem to mind too much.

You saying "the only way" then listing two ways isn't adding to your credibility.
You're also forgetting a third way which is easy because it requires nothing to happen to come true: little or no innovations in the marketplace to spur interest or usage. What if the current market was it, no more expansion? Safe to say the currency would implode.
And a fourth way: government regulation and intervention. Maybe someone innovates and enough governments decide that's not appropriate. Not a reversal of policy but a clarification or refinement.

No offense, but you're arguing the wrong point here. Even escrow relies on, get this, trust.
There have been many escrow scams, simply involving a corrupt 3rd party that exploits the concept of impartiality. A gives B the coins, C gives B proof of shipping an object. A says they never got it, B sides with A and A ends up with goods and coins.
bitcoin requires the one who pays first to trust. 
The simple benefit of bitcoin is proof of work and no reversibility. Once you receive payment it's yours.
Business models where you assert and gain trust while maintaining anonymity are feasible and strong. Using it as a payment vector when you're trusted is (well should be) cheap and fast compared to other options.
Things like receiving goods for btc or exchanging currencies require you to give up anonymity in order to receive anything. But the option is there in a sort of utopian version of freedom.
 
Scenario: 
Say Amazon knows nothing about you and you pay in bitcoin. That's a problem now for shipped goods.
But what if you opted in to an anonymous po box service that could be the only info amazon knew? 
Now the burden of trust is on the po box. So what if you could pay them anonymously no questions asked? Aside from being wildly illegal to have that sort of business, of course, you would still have surveillance on the box itself if you went to pick something up from it.
Even if you got a courier and paid them anonymously, they'd have to take it somewhere. 
Eventually the chain leads back to you. 
Mixing the above ground world with the cloak and dagger world is just hilarious. 
Tldr: trust is the weakness and trust in your current governmental system is being exploited by those with power. Bitcoin opts out of this trust requirement. You're exactly right that without the illusion of trust and regulation as an equalizer it is just a perpetual Wild West. At least the Wild West allowed those not in power to actually gain some.

OP should change title to "don't daytrade if you don't have the balls for it."
It's just a (hopefully math backed) guessing game. As with any other monetary, investible instrument. 
One strategy is to just decide what you think it is worth and behave (on forums, in posts, on tv, in real life) accordingly. 
If I think it is worth $1,000 and its under, I will do everything in my power to push it up to $1k and buy all the way up. 
If I think it is worth $1,000 and its over, I will do everything in my power to pull it back down and be selling any over 1k$
This is where the regret "shoulda bought" stories come from, and are unfair. Nobody knows that point. They can't respect themselves and guess at it enough to risk liquidating their entire expendable income and deal with the hassles of acquiring it to wait for that rise. And when it keeps rising have the balls to stop buying and sell when it goes over that point. 
It's also nonsense to treat it like an investment long term because if it reaches stability you realize you're losing money as the world inflates around xbt with, you know, how its run on fiat currently.
it sits at 1000, i'm neither in a buy or sell mode if my position is 1k, so its time to "use."
If it was fast enough, and there was a good reason, you'd be using it already.

You're wrong. Bitcoins appreciating does make a miner profitable/break even.
If I spend $1000 on a miner, it breaks even or is profitable after the maintenance and running cost alongside the bitcoins it generates crosses value of $1000.

it gets its value from people assigning it value.
a few of the properties to consider:
* cost of generation
* low transaction cost
* provable, public proof-of-work
* peer-to-peer
* decentralized
* permanent transactions
cost of generation is the lowest form of basis, and largely irrelevant now unless you're trying to do some sort of ROI analysis regarding investment in mining today.
the other features add up to it potentially being a widespread "good thing" and if you use various maths can yield $40,000 to $900,000 per coin in the long run. That value comes from the simple math of replacing incomes with bitcoin. if there are X bitcoins, Y incomes, Z people and P percent adoption, you can easily estimate a number. That's the main long term valuation we've seen.

That's your assertion. The counter assertion is that only a greater fool would send or receive bitcoins as payment when it is in discovery / this volatile.
Reddit gold at 1btc=$20 ? Wordpress sites? You simply have to assess the agenda and other holdings otherwise the 10k bitcoin pizza makes little sense and seems foolish when decontextualized.
I find it flat out impossible to believe anyone is using it who is not pushing for their long term investment to inflate, doing something illegal or "privately," plain old curiosity, or some sort of crusade for the technology anti-banking libertarianism....
Or they're an early adopter who can throw it away because they're only wasting a small chunk of it.
But yeah, explain how someone outside of those categories would, say, buy bitcoins just to then buy a $ gift card from gyft?
Why wasn't gyft roundly heralded as the complete legitimizer of bitcoin when it fulfills those next steps of using bitcoin exclusively? 
100% because that use is towards the pedestrian end of things. Anyone with an eye towards the potential of bitcoin realizes the binary, if it is successful it is worth a large multiple of where it's at. If it fails it is worth zero.
In short, not every purchase with bitcoin stabilizes it or proves its value, it could alienate based on volatility past that use. If someone asserted that basically every person who cashed out in large quantity towards gyft or something they could have used fiat on will have wasted it, I'd find it hard to disagree.
I only harp on gyft because it is the most reputable, widespread application so far with a huge ad presence. It's so effortless and eases so many bitcoin problems that it itself is suspicious or wasn't gleefully accepted due to the authentication issues that now tie bitcoin addresses to email to shipping potentially....

4. Providing a tie in from your wallets to exchanges via info dumping and authentication, waiting for it

7. buying a gyft card, hopefully the price didn't fluctuate so much you can't afford it otherwise go back to 
1. typing in the same card number from step 4 to buy the gyft card
2. that's it
Hey what happened to cheaper fees? Why does a card bought with bitcoins cost as much as one bought with visa? so much for "passing the savings on" huh?
gosh, i'm gonna have to go with this being some sort of weird tracking honey-pot because it really only benefits those looking to get-rich-quick and those who don't fully understand that if bitcoin takes off, this will look like nothing, or perhaps anyone sitting on so many coins they don't mind "diversifying" by buying a sword on amazon. 
You are confusing "accessibility" with "establishing the next tier in the ponzi scheme." 
Why would people not want to follow gyft's business model. Accept the funny money because one day its going to clearly be worth more. I'd love to know their long vs short strategy, they'd be foolish to not be holding, as everyone is.
This is silly. It is why gyft didn't make too much of a splash in the old guard of the bitcoin community. The idea is to use the coins AT those stores, not use the coins with an intermediary who ignores the cost savings of the cheaper transactions. When you save the stores money directly, they can lower prices. Just like amazon did by merging wholesaling / distro /etc all in one place. 
but yeah i'm sure they love the idea a middleman is profitting off of the idea to convert BTC to amazon cards. amazon could be doing that. they're the chumps, taking essentially fiat instead of the coin.
If amazon adopted bitcoin i guarantee their prime perks and shipping costs would not merely evaporate, they'd see massive resistance. if they had balls they would stand up to the skimmers, and integrate bitcoin into amazon payments.  then they could drop the mic down on the ground and beat branson into space.

You don't even mention alt-coin markets which are all doing fine / better since bitcoin dropped. 
In 12 hours bitcoin is up 20%, in 24 hours its down 17%. If you don't know how to make money off of that, you shouldn't be making videos saying how "unlikely" it is to do so.
Let people do what they want with their money. By your logic if they "lose" the money it means the people ending up with the coins are probably stronger hands that can do more with it. It's not unlike a casino. People use casinos even with -EV, yet that's not a bad thing.

You can emulate this easily with a calculator.

It would be like an affiliate of a sister-company to google adopting it and everyone saying GOOGLE BUYS IN! ... a lot of assumptions of "it must have been OKed by the government." Guess what, in China retroactively breaking the law happens the same way as here. Sometimes, get this, the government ISN'T ok with it, but the law is vague and so it isn't immediately punishable (unless gov feels like it). It goes on for a while until its assessed as unallowable by the authorities or too risky by the entrepreneurs.

so yeah, unsure what delusion fuels the idea that visibility would be so much higher there than here, when we still have much higher profile usage and actual vendor support. They are buying into something that is a lot more mature than, you know, when it was worth 0. 
Why now? is a better question. Where were they when asics or when it was at $0.05?
"Although industry insiders, economists, sociologists and investors have diverging forecasts on Bitcoin's future, they all agree government supervision is what the market needs."
""Bitcoin is hardly a revolutionary product," said Zhang Yuewen, associate researcher at the Institute of Finance and Banking, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Zhang said in essence, Bitcoin trading is no more than privately manufactured money circulating on the internet."

it works, but film is still used over digital. not commonly in the consumer segment, but digital resolutions are still expensive over analog versions at large scale. It is relatively more cheap to create a 7x7 foot exposure via chemical / analog processing than it is to do the same with a digital sensor.
Every idea / technology goes through the same growth and innovation curve pattern. The most is thrown at a technology when it is the most lucrative to do so: peak usage.
New techs don't replace old techs or transition evenly/gradually. Both are used until one simply isn't anymore. The dropoff is rather steep.
My problem with OP's graph is that it implies a "new tech" adoption is separate from the old tech, rather than building on it and harnessing previous adoption. 
The idea that we drive cars on a road and expressway is the foundation for when cars become 100% electric. They're still cars. The next version of cars that fly or whatever still need to use some of the infrastructure and the concept that cars provided, thus while the adoption for that specific innovation is zero, a large % of that innovation is based on preexisting tech and isn't wholly separate.
in your example, digital photography is a growth from analog photography, not an exclusive 'new' route.

bitcoin is a proof-of-work system, whats wrong to focus on its utility and intrinsic qualities over extrinsic valuation? maybe then people will stop writing about how its a scam or can't succeed and write about the things it does really well?

10.38 is not FOR A YEAR... It is a PREORDER to be able to GET A CONTRACT not for the actual rate / actual cost. They say it will start january but will 'really' kick in months later. aka, all they're doing is gathering cash to be able to fund their shit and mine with it for testing purposes, raking in profits while jacking up difficulty and then eventually it hits a point where owning and running the hardware is not worth finally giving it to you.
Ask anyone who's been through the BFL wringer: they will stall/delay and only very few early people / shills will get a profitable piece and the rest of the folks will either come close to lose but eventually break even or flat out never recoup costs.
if somehow difficulty were frozen and you paid no electricity you'd generate
1 gh/s makes .0008 bitcoin per day 
.0008*365 = .292
Assume a difficulty increase gradually tapers that off or not.
the bottom line is this product will never, ever cost anywhere near what .292 bitcoins is worth... it will be vastly more expensive in the name of 'convenience' and 'maintenance costs'

the typography on this website is what's fail. holy shit, here's a tip: if you write most of the article in bold its like you're not bolding anything. Underlines have long not meant 'emphasis' you never float a hyphen like - that, you would use a double or emdash--this way--to denote parenthetical information and use an en-dash this way.
when you have new sections use larger font size in H tags, rather than bold AND underline AND italics.  
If you've already quoted something, you don't need to have it in bold and italics, the surrounding device is enough to offset it.
It really makes your site look shittier than it already is.

what happens if all governments tax you out the wazoo if you accept or handle bitcoins in any form, as you have responsibly denoted on your tax forms?
what happens if all governments pull funding and remove tax exemptions for non-profits that accept bitcoins?
what happens when credit card companies feel sufficiently threatened by bitcoins to start leaning on regulators and major marketplaces to bar their use?
I think your question folds on itself immediately. People "opt in" to regulation because it is required for exchanging bitcoins with any sense of security or reputation. Past that, we have localbitcoins + the risks involved, or direct trade / barter. 
What happens when governments never accept bitcoins for tax payments?
This dries up the libertarian utopia of a closed system currency where people only trade bitcoins, as soon as an authority requires you to have their currency to pay tax and doesn't allow anyone to exchange that currency for it.
Also, that makes the local fiat mighty powerful when it is now required in order to legally utilize bitcoins, as it is now.
So yes, what happens?

And I am directly saying you're a shill, never mind that 100% of your posts refer to or speak about BFL.
I'm saying you're spreading bullshit regarding profitability of BFL that you received in october.
by the way, you could have gotten 300% return on your money basically constantly if you would have just bought coins instead of investing into the pyramid scheme.
The power of shills like you are to attempt to blind people into thinking the tip of the pyramid scheme stays in tact as it moves to lower tiers. Yes, people who got their items early probably got those that were crafted better and were profitable. Those people rush to defend the great pyramid because they're on the top.
You will never convince anyone that the bitcoin or cash you spent when you invested in your "profitable BFL rig" was better spent on that than on just buying coins. No mining product bought in the first half of this year and delivered in the second half has returned 16x the investment at current btc valutation or upwards of 32x investment at extremes. 
You saying that $1250 of coins bought at $20 each is worse than getting 25gh/s starting in october? Lol OK, it's verifiably bullshit that you'd ever recoup 60 coins in 3 months from october to now, let alone even getting 1.5 coins to recoup the loss.

the problem is there are things in bitcoin that could be better / different.
but those without complete understanding think it is a matter of making one thing different and you've "improved" it. They're not grasping that modifying any part of bitcoin is actually making something else, that has its own problems and won't work as well or to the same point.
Now if we give him the benefit of the doubt and he fully grasps the proof-of-work concept of bitcoin, which i can tell you there's no way he does, his point is completely valid. I just don't think it necessarily applies to this technology.
When branson adopts bitcoin, it isn't really that big of a deal because he's got money to burn and can risk so much on it and still have plenty left over that it isn't really "having faith it will do well." It's no different than someone else putting up a donation QR code and seeing if it sticks.

I am fucking sick and tired of people and their "Great Rants" documents. This sort of self-publishing and note-taking has destroyed an entire medium because it isn't loud, obnoxious and irritating enough to compete for the dullard's attention spans. So people quietly collect rants on their desktop publishing devices instead of being out in the world, ranting truths at the sun. Disgusting. 
Even worse, this collecting and instant publishing on annoying fuckwit syndication services encourages people to intentionally use the pseudoprivate platforms strictly for this behavior, keeping it bottled up in a "move to recycle bin" useless platform. A steam release instead of getting out in the world and actually changing things.
Letters to the editor in newspapers were the havens of recluses and shut-ins that lacked worldy experience to understand if they want to fix or change things they have to interact with society and make impactful decisions. Not some sort of meta-game where their 'expressed concern' IS an action by educating people to their caustic vapor of an opinion. Diluted into an ignorable mist by the same force that output it.
The irony then, was those who were ranting were apparently not aware that those who were disinterested weren't uneducated - they were simply more effectively causing change.
And now you, you collect these things because the sensationalism of pandering to the everyman's retarded tongue has become click-fodder on websites. Because obsessive collection is rewarded time and again over creating things that make the non-collectables valuable. 
Do you have an idea that you've been pawing at that maybe you'll take these rants and self-publish them? How quaint. 
To summarize: you're doing the wrong thing. You're doing the wrong thing wrongly, and you're not even smart enough to realize why. You're encouraging the wrong thing to be done, and you're only hurting yourself in the long run. 
I'll reply to your reply: wrong reply.

I think the fact that it's been rejected 175 times over decades shows that the us patent office isn't corrupted in chase's favor. So if your point was correct, some other bank would be the cause of the rejection because 'their plant' was in there.
But really, there are reviews and audits and these policies are easily enforced, aka, if someone had a conflicting patent first (the grounds for chase's patent) they will sue.
If chase patents something that should be 'not patentable' someone else's rejection could turn into an unfair suit very easily.

Why are people not grasping that it is precisely the manner in which it was legally defined that caused the drop as it went from completely unregulated to completely regulated for a large populous?

It could be... and it is with bitcoin. Initially with bitcoin people were seeing it as a sort of rube goldberg machine that converted electricity and computer components into this currency. 
Not everything has a production cost tied to its intrinsic value.
I could create a big pile of ash out of 10 $100 bills or a big pile of ash out of 10 $1 bills. One of those piles cost $1,000 and the other cost $10 but that has no bearing on the value of "big pile of ash" because I could create the same pile with a far cheaper material.
You could do a pretty simple estimate of how much it has cost to produce each bitcoin, and you could easily use that as the low bounds of the estimate of its "value."

Even open source software has investible cottage industries built around them. aka, you don't invest in bitcoin you invest in the industry around bitcoin. looking at the growth of the blockchain versus the disk space needed for it, it is clear that vanilla bitcoin is largely irrelevant to the masses.

I don't think the "except for a hack" is relevant, really. There are a finite number of individual units and sliding the decimal over to create more subdivisions of units is infinitely doable.
I suppose you can do the same thing with any store of weath if you apply some extreme science to it (how much is 1 atom of gold worth???)...
the problem is that the science to collecting and storing gold atoms is vastly more expensive than moving the decimal point over in software to increase the number of discrete units by a factor of ten.
edit: I had to figure it out, one atom of gold if 1 oz is ~$1200 =

I stopped reading because 1-9 are provably false from the point of view of a government funded institution.
The fees aren't lower, the transaction cost isn't lower, the barrier to adoption is not knowing what exemption status or impact on grants or funding will play out, nowhere near as easy to adopt as card machines (vendors hand us card machines, you can buy a square reader at best buy), not cheaper than a card machine, there are no overdraft charges for a solvent institution, not necessarily any room to grow unless you're asserting that philanthropy happens more due to bitcoin which is absurd, it relies on bank trust to not change their policy and pull the rug out from under exchanges who are required to register users with banks, we pay for those services for consumer and merchant protection, banks and governments can easily seize the wealth because an institution is nothing without spending power and reporting of spending for tax exemptions.

here's some mindblowing valuation math.
1. there are 21,000,000 bitcoins total
2. there are X people in the world who have an income and use an internet connected smartphone / computer total
3. the average income of those people is Y
you decide what X and Y are.

what does that make 1 bitcoin worth at that adoption rate in the future when btc is capped?
Yes, that's right, we're talking millions.
So, I like to pretend that the current value of bitcoin is just a fraction of its potential value. Will it ever reach 100% potential aka the end of all currencies besides bitcoin? Doubtful. But if it did, you can see the huge price discrepancy, right?

Please validate how bitcoin is hugely successful? To me it is successful if it is worth $1, $0.0000001 or $10,000,000,000...
From a usability stance it works, but why would I use it? I have some. Why would I spend it? It won't impact my economy meaningfully... Versus lowering prices somewhere due to lower fees.
