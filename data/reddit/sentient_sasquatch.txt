could you please elaborate on why deflation is a bad thing?
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:25:09


I would be very interested to see the logic and calculation behind this. Anyone done the calculation themselves?
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:52:13
how about on PC though?
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:01:32
I think both those scenarios are unrealistic.
@_date: 2017-05-15 08:16:18
great response! and your English is very good too. just watch those plurals :)
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:12:11
i am familiar with this, but it just seems counter intuitive in this sense. you go on an exchange and they usually only offer coins for a fixed price. scarcity is never brought into question.
i guess my point is, in traditional markets (i.e. tangible goods) there is a real sense of scarcity/availability. However, in the digital sense, this problem doesn't present itself in the same way. I hope my confusion makes sense?

bitcoin's current market cap is still an infant of its potential
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:02:52
It would be a phenomenal turn of events for the price to remain at a plateau for the next 3 years, something we haven't seen in the history of bitcoin.

Good write up 
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:21:44
the bubble argument is always a fair one, but I don't think we are in a bubble right now. The legalization of bitcoin in Japan literally just increased the demand for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-15 05:39:16
right. So would you say bitcoin has any intrinsic value?
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:50:57
exactly, the cryptomarket should be a small part of a diverse portfolio
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:37:30
your elaborations are welcome here :)
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:15:41
thats a bit more clear, thanks. where do you think the price of bitcoin is headed?
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:49:57
with comments like this you undermine the real use cases Bitcoin has.
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:27:50
0% transaction fees is impractical? small business will eat it up! in any case, bitcoin doesn't need 'mass adoption' in order to increase its market cap continually.
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:22:04
smart man, im still on the fence about buying in now
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:28:53
Could you elaborate on why that is?
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:54:46
0 worth per bitcoin is incredibly unlikely. its use as a black market currency alone gives it the potential for a market cap of half a trillion dollars.
@_date: 2017-05-15 05:52:41
i wonder, then, whether in the case of bitcoin (if we operate on your principle) that we can make a reasonably risk free investment in this "outside currency", at no risk to the economic growth of our own nation. See, although the use of bitcoin is rising, there is no reason to suggest it will overtake fiat currencies, simply because they operate in different domains. And thus, we are getting the best of both worlds for our investment.
What we have here is an opportunity for investment due to the simple 'principle', as you pointed out, that the 1BTC of the future will be worth more than the 1BtC of today. Would you agree? Buy and hodl?
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:07:14
exactly. have faith that bitcoin will remain
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:03:59
Can someone please give the most eli5 explanation on how to run a UASF node? 
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:54:31
serious question: how is it scarce?
@_date: 2017-05-15 11:22:22
i must say, that is some scary shit. thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:19:33
insane. i remember back in 2011 when they were 5 bucks each. no one saw it coming.
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:56:03
dont be too hard on yourself, no one saw it coming
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:52:41
Which ones and how so? 
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:21:39
just an update. i've decide to buy and hold one bitcoin for a year or two before i even think about selling it. tools like [this] ( convince me that there is still a lot of room for growth. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:27:01
very true. i just wonder when it will hit a plateau, and what it will look like.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:14:58
australia's main exchange coinjar has instant processing
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:57:56
right, but how does this naturally lead to a higher value?
