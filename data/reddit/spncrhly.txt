That is assuming Bitcoin consistently continues to work for you in comparison to the interest of the mortgage. I believe in it as much as the next person but that is still different than *knowing*. I *know* how much I have in mortgage debt, and I *know* my property will have real value regardless of the currency that prevails. I also *know* that no longer paying a mortgage every month would be life changing, both financially, and in my career.

I'm willing to risk it

I feel like it's worth mentioning 20k can be a nice down payment on a house... no longer throwing rent away to someone else, now paying mortgage into something you own, which will in turn, gain value.

Again, I agree on the end goal of Bitcoin as a philosophy. However, I can't pay off my mortgage in Bitcoin (as of right now). So I would need to "cash out", for lack of a better term, to fiat in order to pay that off, should it come to that point.  Not because it is "safer" but because that is what the mortgage company accepts.

Pfff just lower your expectations a little

What about people cashing out to pay off their house, put their kids through college, etc? I agree with you, but I also think once my value is enough to pay off my house I'm going to be really tempted to cash out...

Yeah and if it hits 100k it's not like he's ever going to need another job

My favorite moment was when I received this beautiful shift card in the mail and filled my gas tank with bitcoin.

Unfortunately, I'm not in Australia, so that's not going to help me.

additionally, I feel as though this would allow me to be more active in the Bitcoin economy. currently none of my USD get a chance to be converted to BTC, because I usually want to keep it all in my bank account in order to make sure my bills get paid while waiting on clients to pay their invoices.

I agree, but that opinion comes from speculation on future value. If we speak in relative terms, bitcoin is at a fairly high price  compared to what we have known its value to be and currently above the highest weekly average price we have seen in the past. Is it not wise to be doing some more short-term trading with a portion of your bitcoin investment based on the values as we have known them to be?
 I agree that the value will go up significantly over the years but its also changing (relatively) drastically on a smaller scale right now. My personal opinion based on past market behavior and recent news is that we may have recently reached a point where we won't see them under $100 again anytime soon, which I think is a notable landmark worth recognizing &amp; a step towards the stability I'm asking about.
I admittedly have no experience in finance or this type of thing. I am just trying to think logically about what I am seeing and have seen the market do over the past few years.

No mention of bitcoin, but still relevant
