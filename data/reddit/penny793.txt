The stock GBTC is a very easy way to get exposure to bitcoin. My gut tells me its overvalued right now as the price has been skyrocketing as of the past week or two, but if you want to invest with a retirement fund or a roth IRA (to legally avoid having to pay capital gains taxes on the massive gains that I am expecting) then this may be an option you want to consider.

Imagine Etrade holds customers' cash balances and investments and then somebody hacks Etrade and steals all major customer investments. The major investments made up a vast majority of holdings and so even though cash and some fringe investments were unaffected, the loss of the major investments was so large that Etrade is now potentially insolvent and halting operations.
In this example, Bitfinex is like Etrade and Bitcoin is the major investment where the vast majority of trading and volume came from. Also, with the company Bitfinex, there is no government insurance of bitcoin or rigid government financial regulation of bitcoin so there is some uncertainty regarding whether anyone will get any money back.

Thats very much of a stretch. Also, I don't like it when people use the word "stealing". I've been in this space for years, and this terminology of "stealing" only came up with Bitcoin Cash. Before Bitcoin Cash, there was always pride in the concept of open source and the spirit of code being available to anyone to fork. I think calling it stealing stems from bitterness and maybe feeling threatened inside. If that weren't the case, why aren't people complaining about Bitcoin Diamond or Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Candy?

From what I understand, BCH community is not opposed to 2nd layer, they say that its not ready yet and when it is, they will port it over to BCH. This announcement regarding LN is great news and something that not just BTC but the entire crypto space should be looking forward to.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:19:45

@_date: 2017-12-15 23:13:14
Even the original that you think is the original isn't actually the original. Do you remember the soft-fork which changed how signatures work? The world evolves - no need to get petty over it. Truth is, people have a problem with BCH because they feel threatened and maybe deep down inside understand that it is a legitimate competitor. I don't hear a peep out of anyone regarding Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Dark or any other version of Bitcoin.

Of course every forked coin's community wants to replace BTC, but anyone besides bch claiming to aspire to that would be considered a joke. But the level of bitterness that bch haters have shows that although people may hate bch, they still take it seriously. For me, I take both BTC and BCH seriously. May the best man win.

In order to support a $4000 price point, there would need to be a minimum of $14million going into bitcoin on a daily basis so that the newly created bitcoins can consumed by the market (at least until the next halving at which point a minimum of $7million will need to be going into bitcoin on a daily basis).
Like it or not, the current bitcoin price reflects the current supply and demand.

yes, I did get that, thanks for clarifying. That was the whole point of my post. We're making humor of other people's suffering and potential collapse of their entire country. I was just saying to be a little more sensitive.
I understand that if you don't live in Greece maybe you don't understand the severity of the situation (and the fact that Greece is so small may contribute to that as well).
Let me explain it in a different way since apparently people just don't get it... would you say "It's called humor, no?" if people were joking about 9/11? Then think of this as Greece's financial 9/11. This is the worst crisis in at least the past century for Greece. That is why I'm calling for a little more sensitivity.

I see where you're coming from... but bitcoins aren't free and many people in Greece are now broke.

I am excited about bitcoin but I'm curious about the current numbers. Can you confirm that around 3800 bitcoin get created through mining in each 24 hour period, and based on a current price of $235, that equals just under $900,000 per 24 hour period.
Therefore, my thinking is that in order to sustain the current price, there needs to be at least $900,000 of new money going into bitcoin ever 24 hours. Also, my understanding is that the next halving event will decrease the amount of new money that needs to go into bitcoin to sustain price level by a half. Therefore, to sustain a price of $235 (lets say hypothetically the price is still $235 during the next halving), only around $450,000 of new money will have to go into bitcoin during each 24hr period in order to sustain the $235 price.
Is this the right thinking or did I miss some variables that I am not accounting for?

Yes, you're right, but haven't they "secretly" lost with the yen as well due to ridiculous inflation? At least with bitcoin there is potential upside. Yen just seems like its going to continue its steady march downward.
And the bitcoin currency is being honest with people where you know when the value is going down. With yen or other currencies, you have no idea what the value will be based on schizophrenic monetary policies.

From my understanding, this is not a correct statement. Everyone who has a MasterCard IS a customer of MasterCard. Every time you use a MasterCard, MasterCard gets a cut of that transaction fee regardless of whether its Chase Issued, Shell gas issues, Amazon issues, Sears issues, etc. Just because the bank issues the card doesn't mean MasterCard gets nothing. In fact, if my understanding is correct, Mastercard gets the bulk of the transaction fees that are paid when you transact with a card with their logo while Chase gets a small cut for being the issuer.
Its almost like saying if I buy a BMW at the dealership, I am not a customer of BMW. I would disagree with that statement. You are a customer of both, the dealership as well as BMW.

I personally think there is a healthy amount of regulation that could be implemented. Whether its for conventional banks or bitcoin businesses that hold other people's money. I think that regulation should not infringe on people's freedom and should not make it difficult for businesses to operate.
With that said, I have read on reddit some folks who lost funds and are now crying for regulators to step in and try to recover funds. That is why I mentioned that some people are now wanting regulation. I am not pushing for overburdening regulations that make it impossible for entrepreneurs and innovators to operate.

What happens on your curb is different than people shooting up products, video taping it and trying to rationalize it on a very visible public forum like reddit. This is not the same as throwing out products on a curb.
Secondly, two wrongs don't make a right. People who throw out recyclable stuff on a curb need to be educated as do people who shoot up products as a protest. There are other ways to protest besides going to a rifle range and shooting things up.
And yes there are other things to complain about but there will always be other bigger things to complain about. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try to correct something that is wrong. If we always passed up opportunities to correct something just because it seems small, we will never correct anything because there is always something bigger.

I don't think that's always the case. When people get a hold of a few tips, even if its pennies, the feeling of owning something digital that you can send anywhere is empowering. Since the price fluctuates too, sometimes it leads people to check-in on the spot price and its fun to see your number of pennies go up and down.
Starting off with a few pennies could get people to see the potential of bitcoin and spur greater involvement.
Yes, tips probably won't make anyone a millionaire yet, but they are non-serious ways to have fun with the technology.

For me, buying things with bitcoin is a pain and I don't appreciate it for its ability to buy things yet (cuz I don't think its really there... nothing is as simple as swiping a credit card...). I don't even remember what I used to buy some of the stuff I own. But I appreciate and value bitcoin for other reasons.
I think different people will like different things about bitcoin. For you it may be seeing it purchase something for you. For others it may be the ease by which value can be transferred P2P (which is what changetip does extremely well), for others it could be the fact that the supply is limited, etc.
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:46:45
I like the idea of the service but it seems it has trouble with tax collection. For instance, purse.io estimates the tax that should be charged based on location, however, the particular item ordered was a non-taxable item (i.e. an e-book). Therefore, it seems the buyer's credit card didn't get charged tax so the order was cheaper for him. The seller however, loses bitcoin since the tax was debited to account for the estimated tax.

I read some people are calling bitcoin a gamble now... The difference between a gamble and an investment is knowledge and education. For those who know bitcoin and understand it, it's not a gamble. You can call mtgox a gamble but don't call bitcoin a gamble.
This is bad news no doubt and I'd be worried about the mental health of anyone arguing otherwise. But it's a set back in the grand scheme of things. Do you realize that even with the price where it is that it's still higher than just a year ago by many magnitudes?
Also I understand mtgox is not a bank and you don't feel as secure now with bitcoin. Freedom comes at a price. You have to be MORE VIGILANT with bitcoin at its current stage of development than with cash at a bank.
This is why I don't advise non tech savvy people to get involved yet because bitcoin is still rough around the edges for some. Some don't know how to back up their wallets, good security practices (i.e. don't keep money at mtgox), etc.

"Realistic" is a very subjective term. It depends on the collection of information in your head. Everyone has different information in their head.
Regarding 0% chance of failure... again, this depends on what you mean by failure. I agree that bitcoin has a 0% chance of failure because Bitcoin has already succeeded even if the currency collapses to $0. It cannot fail considering what it has done to open people's eyes and forward technological innovation. As a technology it is a modern day marvel. As a currency I would say its in the middle of a transition from an experiment into something that is practically implemented and relevant in society.

I personally can't say I like the WU bashing but it doesn't bother me that much either. Truthfully, comparing Bitcoin to WU is not comparing apples to apples. There is a mix of forces in play with WU since it is a real business functioning in the modern world.
(1) It has employees and bills to pay as well as offices and locations to maintain... they must charge something as they are not a charity organization.
(2) They have fundamental risks in their line of business and they (by law) have to some extent track money to ensure it is not ending up in "unwanted hands". They do this because its the law in various countries they operate in, not because they want to (I am fairly confident that if it wasn't law, they wouldn't do it because its costly and cuts into their profits).
(3) They do have a certain level of support that they provide their clients. When clients run into issues, they're not forced to beg for help on reddit.
(4) Lets be real, businesses are open to make money and they only stay in business if they provide people with a real service and value. Do you honestly think that all or even most of WU customers and the people they send money to have the technological know how to acquire, protect, and transfer bitcoins? WU's advantages are exactly bitcoins weaknesses - they allow people to easily transfer money with limited know-how and without fear of losing that money by a thing as simple as malware or hacking.

I was thinking exactly what you were thinking when I first saw the link because of the title of the link. When I read the article though, it says he actually lost half of what he invested in bitcoin... not half of his complete retirement investment...
"The reality is that the bitcoin investment is less than 5% of my overall portfolio... "
So he invested 5% of his retirement funds in bitcoin and he lost half of that retirement investment. So according to him, he would have lost 2.5% of his overall retirement funds.
Not the best title in my opinion.

Science and religion aren't like opposites or opposed to each other. Many incredible scientists are religious people who believe in God. Its over-simplistic to put science/intelligence/atheism on one end of the spectrum and religion/God on the other end of the spectrum. There are plenty of dumb atheists and smart believers of religion.
Wikipedia on Einstein:
"He also called himself an agnostic, while disassociating himself from the label atheist, preferring, he said, "an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being.""

Very interesting stuff.
When the money supply shrinks and the difficulty is doubled, won't this reflect in the price and make bitcoins appreciate faster?
Also, if bitcoins fall too low and mining is no longer profitable, won't this reduce mining operations and cause the bitcoin supply to also shrink? How do miners typically respond to lower prices and loss of profitability?
Sorry, I'm not an expert and just trying to learn more about the intricacies of bitcoin economics.

You make some good points and I agree that providing avenues to get help could be a really good idea. I don't think the war on drugs is effective and as of now I think my tax dollars can be spent better elsewhere.
I am not in favor of 100% banning nor 100% freely allowing. I think the thinkers and leaders in society need to put their heads together and figure out a middle ground.
Speaking as a family man, I read a comment about Open Bazaar being an open source alternative to Amazon/Ebay. But would someone with younger brothers, sisters, children want their family members going on Amazon and having easy access to drugs and firearms?
I would like to believe that there is a happy middleground between no access and completely open access. Unfortunately, with the very emotionally charged stakeholders who try to sway the conversation one way or the other, I am skeptical that the happy middleground will ever be reached.

Don't look at price. Look at supply and demand. You mentioned bitcoin is half the price of gold. Price doesn't matter. Think of it like this - BTC is half the price of gold but what about mBTC? mBTC is only a small fraction of the price of gold. Price is relative. To decide what you want to invest in, it's not easy and it's definitely not based on absolute price. 
The answer to what the right balance is will be complex, a lot of experts and smart people are trying to get the balance right but will inevitably get it wrong because there are so many different variables and actors. For example, many people said bitcoin to $1000 but they didn't factor in mtgox. Others said gold to $5000 but they didn't factor in price manipulation. Also, the right balance constantly changes with the circumstances.
Good luck factoring in the millions of variables, regulations and human egos!
My suggestion would be to pick a balance that you think is reasonable based on your research and the less heavy you go towards one side, the less your risk will probably be in case bitcoin crashes or in case gold price crashes.
Disclaimer: this is not investing advice and you should consult an expert before making investment decisions.
EDIT: by the way, you posted this in r/bitcoin... Remember that as you read some responses such as "ALL BITCOIN!!!!". I'm not saying all bitcoin will not turn out to be the better choice, but you are getting very biased answers and going all-in in one investment of course means greater risk.

The words "up to" always worry me. Up to 97% could also mean actually 5% or 60% or 95%. We don't know I guess. It's like when retailers say "get up to 70% off!!!" Even if only one of their items was 70% off and the rest were only 10% off. I prefer the words "at least" in these situations.

I agree with you to some extent.
Regarding drugs, many people who think they should be free to consume drugs, end up being slaves to the drugs rather than to "the man". Just go ask a heroin or crack addict and ask them how free they feel. Addiction is not freedom. Addiction is slavery to the self.
Regarding weapons... is it appropriate to let just anyone get their hands on that weaponry? I understand the gun advocates view that we need to protect our freedoms. But doesn't the current framework allow for that in a sensible way? For instance, if someone wanted guns legally, can't they get that after going through background checks? It just seems to me that without background checks, the unchecked distribution of guns is more likely and mostly going to be taken advantage of by the wrong type of people rather than the freedom loving and protecting type of people.

Nah, to me its not a matter of what the product is. I support bitcoin and Android and the only person I purchased an Apple product for in the past few years is my father as I feel he doesn't need the superior functionality and flexibility of an Android device at the expense of the simplicity and intuitiveness of an Apple product. All other tablets (3) and phones (4) in my house are android.
But even if I don't like apple products and don't foresee myself ever switching to one, I sold the last few Apple products I had years ago (iPhone 3GS and iPad 1st gen) and they actually retain their value pretty well. And even though I wouldn't use the software, the build quality of Apple products is generally better than most of the plasticky Android hardware out there. I'm ok with plasticky though as I love the Android software.

I think you are missing the fundamentals of how gold and silver price are manipulated. Banks issue certificates for gold/silver and even "rent" out the physical metals. This creates phantom supply in the market of gold/silver that does not actually exist. How is this being done with bitcoin and can it even be done? With bitcoin there is a public ledger of real bitcoin and people actually trade their real bitcoin instead of fake certificates. Therefore, JP Morgan Chase will have trouble manipulating the price since they would have to create "paper" bitcoin that doesn't actually exist but that people actually agree to buy. The reason people may be averse to "paper" bitcoin is because it would actually be easier to buy real bitcoin than paper bitcoin whereas with gold, obtaining real gold/silver and storing and securing and trading it is actually not as simple (think transport, shipping, insurance, etc.) which is why trading "paper" silver/gold is attractive and the fake paper has demand.
EDIT: after second thought, I don't know if they'll have trouble manipulating the price, but I do think it will be harder for them due to the public ledger (there is no public ledger of gold/silver and which wallet owns which chunk of metal... I think when they "rent out" the metals, multiple people can actually own the same metal which is akin to multiple addresses having the same bitcoin in it which from my knowledge isn't possible). Therefore, they will need to come up with new creative ways to manipulate bitcoin as the same methods that were tried and employed with metals will not work.

I hope you understand that its not apples and oranges. You don't need to have any technical skills/knowledge to store and secure dollars or credit cards. And if someone hacks your credit card, you are not responsible and you can get your "backup" mailed to you by the credit card company in 1 business day. You don't need to do any backups with credit cards. And you are not responsible for fraudulent charges.
Also, you can't compare credit cards and bitcoins. Credit cards don't hold your money, they hold your debt. Your balance on your credit card is how much you owe, not how much you have. Bitcoin wallets are completely different in that they hold your actual money, not your debt. And credit cards typically have a maximum limit and/or a daily spending limit so that 50k in debt and charges out of the blue is not likely.

No, it can't. Credit cards are extremely easy to use and you don't even need a backup. If you lose your card or it gets "hacked" (even if its due to one's own stupidity), the credit card company sends you a new one and you are not responsible for any of the fraudulent charges, no questions asked. What happens if you lose your wallet backup? Or if someone hacks your wallet?

You mostly see HODL on reddit and if they are on reddit, they should know what to expect. I don't see Coinbase, Xapo, etc using terms like HODL.

20/20 hindsight. Stock and commodity markets aren't guaranteed returns just as much as bitcoin isn't a guaranteed return. Markets are generally good at balancing risk/reward.

I agree. Diversifying is never a bad idea. Pick your percentages and if one asset goes up and the other goes down, buy and sell to maintain those allocations so that you reduce your risk. Of course, reduced risk usually means reduced returns because I do think bitcoin will go to the moon but I also think its possible that gold can go to the moon but there is a chance bitcoin won't go to the moon. Gold is an easier investment for the layman and its easier for non-tech savvy people to store and secure gold as opposed to storing and securing bitcoin. There are some people in my family that I would NEVER recommend bitcoin to because they can't even properly secure their email accounts.

Terrorism is a tool that governments use to get what they want. If you really think about the number of deaths that are attributed to terrorism... I read that people have a greater chance of dying from their own furniture. However, furniture doesn't generate fear like terrorism does and thus its harder to manipulate people with threats of furniture-induced death.
Also, if the government was really concerned with people's lives, they could have used that same money to provide free health insurance for everyone (I'm not saying they should but I'm making a point) which would definitely have saved more American lives.

Thank you for this post. I think everything you wrote is sensible and this deserves an upvote. I did want to point out, however, that not everyone uses bitcoin the same way. So based on the uses cases most common to you, having 3 days of delayed confirmations or confirmations requiring higher fees is fine. However, for people who envisioned bitcoin to be a technology and currency that allows for consistently negligible fees, everyday reliability and something they can count on to use for lets saying paying a bill at a restaurant tonight (like lets say a credit card) - they don't see things in the same light.
The whole debate is a difference of philosophy and trust. Just remember the memes that were so prevalent months ago about bitcoin - comparing it to credit cards, negligible fees, paypal, etc. However, people are starting to see that not everyone is on board with that vision. In fact, it seems the future of bitcoin is that there will be fees and maybe the use of paypal may be better (and cheaper) than on-chain transactions from a cost perspective. I understand layer 2 plans are in the works, but I don't think anyone believes that layer 2 solutions will be free or not have their share of drawbacks.

hodling is awesome of course. The only concern is, we are hodling something that is losing one of its most attractive use cases (free/cheap transactions). What will happen if a cooler altcoin comes along with this awesome use case that allows for cheaper transfers and bitcoin starts losing its pizzazz? Cheap, convenient, and inexpensive transfers were one thing that differentiated bitcoin from metals like silver/gold. I remember all the memes comparing bitcoin to paypal and western union and whatnot. If another altcoin starts gaining favor in the market and displaces bitcoin even for this one use case, all the folks hodling may be in for a rude awakening.

I like the idea of 2 bitcoins. One focused on being a settlement layer and the other focused on being a payment network.

If he wants to keep his head buried in the sand and ignore everything in the outside world, he's free to do so. In 2 years bitcoin will be 10 years old and its already not the newest and freshest technology it used to be. The smart people have started to diversify. Most of the top 10 cryptos in marketcap have doubled in value just this year so far and some have tripled or quadrupled.

I don't think mempool and confirmation time was their major concern. I think their fee payouts were the major driving force as these costs would get passed down in their ecosystem. From their blog post:
"Because Counterparty transactions create small inputs and are heavier than normal BTC transactions, users have experienced extremely high fees for transactions.

They should have advance notice of an impending fork if there is one (no guarantee that there will or won't be unless there is strong consensus). They should have an interim contingency plan to identify the forks uniquely so they can be differentiated and when it becomes clear as day which is the longer valid chain (shouldn't take long I believe), that longer valid chain should be "Bitcoin" thereafter.

Yes, I agree with that. But guess what, if the community, miners and nodes say they value BU and the majority of the community shifts to signaling/supporting BU (none of which has happened yet) - I bet you it wouldn't take a week for that to be reflected at Bitfinex, Coinbase and BitPay. These companies go where the market goes. They are businessmen, not ideologues.

I don't think anyone truly believes bitcoin will die. I think alts trying to differentiate themselves as superior to bitcoin (which in some specific regards and use cases they can be) is for marketing purposes and its a successful marketing tactic to increase usage.
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:05:48
I would stop this public mudslinging. At this point, discrediting either core or BU hurts the entire bitcoin community and damages credibility of the entire ecosystem. There is already so much blood in the streets. People are fleeing.

Very fitting example with the 911 inside job sub... especially since there are thousands of licensed architects and engineers who say there is more to the 911 story than what is/was publicly communicated and they bring evidence and academics and are trying to find the truth.

I sold for the same reason and lost out on the additional profit for the same reason. You can never predict an irrational market.

People that call a potential future majority fork of Bitcoin an "altcoin" need to grow up. To BU supporters, the Core chain would be an alt and to Core supporters BU would be the alt. This is really just akin to childish namecalling and a propaganda campaign. I never thought I'd see the day when a majority fork of Bitcoin would be referred to as an altcoin. Shows the level of pettiness and extremism that has developed in the community (thus the reason I'm looking forward to a fork and then everyone can move on with their lives).

When dealing with money and investing, you have to know what you are doing and do some basic learning before investing. Lets be honest, crypto exchanges aren't for grandmothers. Even when investing in stocks, you can't make a mistake when trying to buy stocks of Apple and mistakenly purchase APLE instead of AAPL. One of these ticker symbols represents a company producing iPhones. The other is a hospitality real estate investment trust. Are you also helping people figure out the difference between these two and which one they should buy?
@_date: 2016-06-10 20:22:58
Agreed. I did the math...

Lol, salt on a wound 
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:20:27
I agree with you. So consider this a test. If Bitcoin is the system we want it to be, it should be resilient to even this type of "dilution attack". If coins keep splitting, I think that will only solidify the reputation of the original and most dominant chain(s) which maintain dominance as other forks keep diluting themselves and their "value". Each chain should stand on its own merit. If a fork is done for frivolous reasons, why would anyone take it seriously? The BTC/BCH fork was not based on frivolous differences though - it was the result of years of debate and animosity between fragments of the community. I don't think other forks will be taken as seriously unless the debate is as serious.
@_date: 2016-06-10 20:19:29
Yes, all the **new** people because as everyone knows, there is an overabundance of well-funded, economically educated, and technically savvy people who fully understand and appreciate bitcoin and millions of these people are jumping into bitcoin every year.

@_date: 2016-11-15 18:35:13
I think there are other factors with the gold/silver market in play such that the same gold/silver may be "leased out" to multiple parties so it seems like there is more gold/silver being traded/available than actually physically exists. However, since its much easier to secure/hold gold at a individual and personal level, I think there will be less of a need to have someone else hold bitcoin and thereby have the power to "lease out" the same bitcoin. Because remember, most people don't want a stash of gold/silver at home because its not as easy to secure so they go to other avenues such as ETF's which I think makes the gold/silver market ripe for manipulation because people prefer dealing in paper with regards to precious metals.
I almost feel if someone tries to manipulate the price of bitcoin using futures contracts they may get burned because unlike gold/silver which is mined every year and there isn't a hard limit, bitcoin has a hard limit and no one needs to hold paper bitcoin when they can hold/trade/secure the real thing on their own so easily.
I'm wondering, if someone tries to short bitcoin by the billions using futures contracts, wouldn't they likely end up getting burned if their short future contract gets called?

Yes, actually it is. Saddam Hussein wasn't elected by the Iraqi people. He was put into power as a puppet by the US. So the excuse that we went into Iraq to take out Saddam is a pretty bad excuse since the US put him into power in the first place and armed him to the teeth. Thanks for blowing off a legitimate statement with sarcasm.
When we invade and bomb countries, we don't get to say "my bad" and runaway from the problems that we created and then blame everything on the boogie man (i.e. Islam). There is a reason Afghanistan has Al Qaeda and Iraq/Syria have ISIS and unlike the consensus of the Fox News Channel, its not because of Islam. There is a reason these organizations didn't exist prior to decades of meddling, wars, bombings and destruction.

Doesn't seem like they are strong arming... seems more like they are getting the ball rolling because at least they put a January 2016 date to get another fix in before XT's changes have an opportunity to be applied. To me, if Core can get to some solution before January 2016, then people would jump onto and support Core. Why doesn't Core propose some code or solution that people can get on board with? The miners will vote and run whichever code is the right approach.

I think you missed the point.... BitttBurger was saying they meet in person and buy the item in person rather than buying through the site (i.e. the person doesn't click buy on ebay site but instead buys in person) which does bypass any fees for ebay (not just payment fees but even listing fees in that scenario).

I mean, it would be ideal if the alternate system ends being the lightning network or a second layer on top of bitcoin (in which case we just need to be patient and wait) - but what guarantee is there that bitcoin will be that layer instead of some altcoin which comes along and sees an opportunity to steal marketshare?

First off sorry for your loss. Second, a few things from the story raise my eyebrow...
1) your bro had bitcoins on his computer that were accessible by anyone simply by just logging into the computer and no additional security precautions in the software
2) not only were the bitcoins easily accessible, but the computer itself was easily accessible and not only that, your family gave a random stranger that showed up to their door access to that personal computer of your brother without a second thought (I'd be pissed in my grave if my personal computer was ever messed with after my death)
3) how did your late brother's roommate from years ago even know to ask for your brothers computer or think that it would still be accessible or even consider that there may be bitcoin on there for him to steal?
4) it seems your brother was the bitcoin expert in the house. Usually this doesn't always run in the family but ironically, you were savvy enough to look up the transaction history and notice something shady going on
I don't know... story seems... farfetched.

I know what you mean and I agree that you don't have to use the full address, but my point is, we don't need to always be so stringent. Paypal, Bitcoin, Facebook Payments, etc can all exist and serve their purpose. For instance, I would never use bitcoin for ebay purchases because paypal offers more buyer protection and ebay is a place where both buyers and sellers are vulnerable and thus both need protection.
I'm just saying that when we denounce every service/tool/payment method other than bitcoin, we sound like zealots and it ends up alienating some people.

Guess what. I hold GBTC with my Roth IRA. If the value of my Roth IRA doubles or triples with GBTC, do you know how much tax I owe on those earnings? ZERO. Even if I had $1,000 that at some point turned into $1 million when I retire. I owe ZERO tax which could save me hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes in the future. That's why I have bought, held and profited from GBTC and even if the price was $600 per share right now, I'm not selling because there is no ETF in sight for Bitcoin. I'm very willing to pay $4200 per coin for the benefit of buying with my retirement account.

Just look up how to open a Roth IRA account and then look into buying GBTC shares with a Roth account just as you would buy shares of anything else. Don't consider this investment advice though.

Or pay through my credit card which would net me +2% cashback... so instead of +2%... I end up with -3%... a difference of -5% just to make a point and pay in bitcoin. Oh, I forgot the 1% fee needed to actually acquire bitcoin in the first place... so I lose 6%... 
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:02:28
Excellent point. Three things to add though. First, I never said don't hold Bitcoin directly. Second, this doesn't consider the fact that many employees get a corporate match when contributing to their Roth accounts (ie, company sponsored Roth 401k) which could cover some portion of the fees that GBTC would otherwise charge. Last, US taxes MIGHT be higher depending on the how the withdrawals are handled (especially if we aren't talking more than $1000 initial investment and if the final account value is in the 1 millions instead of just $260k... I guess this also depends on how bullish we are on Bitcoin). Still, great analysis - thank you!

Of course, but this is a very extreme scenario you are describing. Miner incentives will ensure there is a dominant chain which will hold the bulk of the value even if the value of all potential chains collectively is less than the current spot price.

I think you might be right in terms of US tax laws. Does that mean it's better to just pay taxes up front and buy Bitcoin directly instead of going the Roth IRA route? What about from an inheritance side? Roth IRAs are some of the easiest and tax advantageous assets to transfer to heirs.

Yes, 2% annually. Are you aware of the tax implications of making hundreds of thousands of dollars by the time you retire and having to withdraw those earnings into your checking account?

There is little benefit in discussing extreme scenarios like this. Sure Roth IRA laws can change. So can Bitcoin tax laws. So can bank account laws. What if bitcoins start being taxed as collectibles? The entire premise of a Roth account is that you pay tax up front so you don't have to pay later. Changing that fundamental fact about Roth accounts seems unlikely since it would defeat the entire purpose of offering the account in the first place. It's more likely that if they wanted to Crackdown on Roth accounts, they would instead phase them out or decrease contribution limits or prevent people from opening new ones. But if we're talking in extremes in terms of what a government might do if it's in trouble then they could do anything, they could take money directly from checking accounts, they can prevent people from withdrawing from checking accounts, etc.

Ok cool, its good to know of alternatives. I did use android wallet for bitcoin before but from what I understood about that wallet, people need to ensure they backup anytime they acquire bitcoins just so they don't lose everything in case they lose their phone, reformat their phone, break their phone, etc. To me blockchain.info seemed safer for the casual bitcoin users who aren't as savvy.
If you don't mind sharing for educational purposes - how do you recommend people backup their android wallet bitcoins? I know there is an export function, and I used to backup the encrypted backup to the cloud because it doesn't make sense backing up to the phone (since if you lose your phone, you lost your backup too).

No dilution for pre-existing owners. However, for any new bitcoin acquired, the value of that bitcoin is now diluted because now investors have double the supply of bitcoin in the market. Depending on which chain they invest money into, that chain benefits and the other chain was deprived of that new investment does not appreciate. Had there been only one chain, all bitcoin investments could only benefit one chain... the chain that was selected for investment benefits while the other one does not. To me it seems like yes, everyone who was an existing holder didn't lose anything since they are on both chains, but going forward, newly acquired bitcoin on either chain will not appreciate as much due to double the supply options between the two chains.

Yes, bitcoin is risky but that is also why people are seeing returns of 1% - 400% depending on when they invested. The people who got in early now have 400x what the initially invested (the extremely early ones got even more). I didn't get in early (I only just put money in within the past year) and I am already up about 25% of what I put in whereas my stocks in the past 5 years are up about 3% after all the ups and downs.
Of course, the stock market might be considered less risky (although there are people who can legitimately argue otherwise) but at the same time the return is not as high. And lets not forget that its been only 5 years ago that the stock market crashed 50%.
Investing is just a matter of balancing risk and reward. Is there greater upside than downside? People have always said bitcoin is extremely volatile, but it nonetheless has been on an upward trajectory.
In the end, we don't need to be so exclusive or extreme in our views. Just the fact that the OP is putting $20k into bitcoin doesn't tell you much in of itself. How would your view of the OP change if he had $20k in bitcoin and $2 million in stocks or if he had $20k in bitcoins and $1k in stocks? Its all a matter of balance and finding the right mix of investments.

Are you looking at just 1 week? The infograph discusses years and months... I think maybe its not the OP that is not looking at the downs... maybe you are not looking at the ups.
I don't think bitcoin will ever be a nickle again because it is too useful to be that low. Think of it this way, if bitcoin even approaches $50 there is an army of people ready to buy at that price who won't let it go down. Personally I think Bitcoins days of being less than $50 are gone.

Truth is, many people are afraid of bitcoin because they don't understand it and its a radical change to something that is very integral to their lives - money. People will fear bitcoin, no doubt.

Of course, a new way to transact is introduced and the only thing banks can think about is how they can profit from it - that is how banks are wired. Keep that in mind. The only reason they offer any service is to make money from it and any bitcoin related offering will be provided for the same reason.
The more bitcoin transactions can remain independent of banker tentacles, the better off it will be and the more true it will remain to the reason for its creation.
With that said, of course it is necessary for the time being to have banks as part of the process since most people get paid in government issued currency. However, it would be great to see a day when people transact enough with bitcoin such that there isn't a need to constantly exchange between dollars and bitcoin. For example, I read about some guy that took his salary in bitcoin. That may seem a little extreme right now due to the relative volatility in bitcoin, but if he gets paid in bitcoin, then for him there is no need for a bank to exchange his government currency for bitcoins.

Yes, currencies have changed throughout time. We may not yet be able to conceive of this possibility but it has happened throughout history.

As a business owner and bitcoin advocate, I have no idea how paying with bitcoin would work. How would it work from a tax perspective? Would I purchase the bitcoins with my business bank account? If so, since I have to report that business purchase of bitcoin from my business account to the IRS - what type of expense is it? Is it a payroll expense? If buying bitcoins is a payroll expense, then I would have had to pay payroll taxes on it. Does the IRS allow bitcoin purchases to be considered a payroll expense?
If I do payroll using personal bitcoins (i.e. outside of my business financials), then of course, I would be paying my employees off the books which is not legal. Sure, there are businesses out there paying off the books, but are we really going to advocate for the masses to adopt the illegal practice of paying employees off the books using bitcoin? I thought the goal was to have bitcoin seen as a legitimate currency that can be used for legitimate purposes.
I don't see any advantage of using bitcoin for payroll. If an employee wants bitcoins, he can take his paycheck in whatever the local currency is and then go and buy bitcoin. At least as a business owner I would know how that pay will be taxed and how it will be reported. Me paying employees in bitcoin will only muddy the waters.

One of the well known strategies to reduce risk is to buy little by little, slowly and regularly. This way, you catch the highs and the lows and this way, if the price crashes tomorrow, at least you'll be able to get some tomorrow at 50% of the price today.
My advice would be to not rush into bitcoin because I still do think its a risk. Be careful with your life savings. Do you really want to wager your retirement on the success of a 4 year old technology?
With that said, I do think bitcoin is still going to go up and it is absolutely revolutionary. I liked one thing I read a few weeks ago... it was something to the effect of "either bitcoin will go to $10,000 or $0". I guess we should be prepared for both of these possibilities.

But do you see how having a Gyft Lite will create confusion for average-Joe users? When they search Gyft, they will need to figure out what the difference is between Gyft Lite and Gyft Full. Usually for most apps, the lite version is free and full version costs something, in Gyft's case, both Lite and Full versions would likely be free and average Joe will need to then make a decision on which one he downloads.
And then... Average Joe accidentally downloads the lite version ("since lite versions are usually free I probably want the lite version right?"). After downloading the lite version, he will then be confused as to why all the promised features he read about aren't there. Then Gyft will have to deal with Average Joe's confusion when he calls in or opens a support ticket...
Damn you Joe!!!
Sure Gyft Lite would address the bitcoin community's paranoia (I'm not insulting the paranoia or saying that its not merited) but for Average Joe that just wants to send daughter Joe a $50 Target gift card for her birthday, I doubt he cares that Gyft has the ability to record him.

I do love bitcoin and hope the protocol succeeds, but honestly, credit cards make my life a lot easier and I have never paid any interest and always have credit cards linked to my bank account with autopay set to full balance payment every month. I've gotten hundreds of dollars back in cash back too with no effort on my part just for using my credit card.
I think the people who get hurt with credit cards are (1) merchants who have to pay the processing fees (2) irresponsible people who live beyond their means, spend too much, and then blame others for charging them interest because they purchased something via debt and didn't pay that debt back in the agreed upon time.
I do respect people who recognize that credit cards are not best for them because it makes them spend more and it's a positive step to rip up those credit cards if you know they are going to get you into trouble.

Sure, dumping your car can make you feel free too because you don't have to spend money on that stupid thing called gas... but at some point you are just making life harder for yourself.
Saying bitcoins is an alternative to credit cards is comparing apples and oranges. Credit cards hold a balance of debt. Bitcoins don't. You can't borrow money from a bank via credit cards, not pay them back in full every month and then expect them to not charge you interest. I wouldn't call banks my best friends but they are not charities either. The solution here is to pay in full each month. Pay in full each month = no interest.

Oh I see what you mean. If you don't use ebay, I can see why you would cancel paypal. I guess one less thing to worry about...

yea, I second that. I prefer online and I'm just trying to navigate the online bitcoin landscape and based on what I read blockchain.info seemed pretty good. Even given that it may not be 100%... I still don't know of any better online alternatives that offer what blockchain.info offers... client side encryption, 2FA, secondary password to send bitcoins... thats pretty good isn't it?

Thats like saying Android should not be released for general use until my grandma can use it. Why not keep up with the progress and let at least the more advanced people use it? People will never be ready for anything revolutionary. That doesn't mean we slow down the revolution.

Yes, I'm not saying Joe wouldn't be able to do what he wants. Its just the added complexity and potential for confusion to some members of the userbase by having two apps instead of one. And I'm not saying its not worth discussing. But there would be a cost/benefit equation here where the app creator would need to decide, is the added confusion worth the benefit gained? Personally, I like the Lite app idea because I too value privacy and careful read through permissions before deciding to install something. But I dread a world where developers start distributing and updating different version of their app to address concerns with permissions and users are left to decipher what the difference between the versions are. There has to be a better way...
For advanced users there is at least one alternative option that the user is free to employ on Android phones... why not use an Android custom ROM which allows you to restrict the app permissions that were granted by default?

sorry, what does this mean?

They can't ban bitcoin either. Its one of those things that they cannot regulate. Its not in their power to ban bitcoin. They can try to slow it down. They can go after the exchanges and domains but they can't prevent people from using bitcoin and the way I see it, even if one or two countries ban it, that won't impact bitcoin much.
On the other hand, even if one country like China accepts it and allows it to function, bitcoin will survive and bitcoin will flourish even if 20 other countries ban it.

Is there really an effort to phase out cash? Is there any evidence of this? From what I was reading, they are having problems phasing out just the penny which costs more to produce than its actual value (

I see where you're coming from. Is this better than 2 step authorization though?

If you look beyond its short term performance, you will realize how meteoric the rise of bitcoin has been and fast the use of bitcoin is spreading. However, I understand how people will selectively choose their data points to support their preconceptions.

Haha, yea right. I'm open to alternatives. If you can point me to another site that's better and safer to use I'm ready to leave. Especially if its an open source and online alternative.

This would be awesome and the process would feel like a stock split.
It would also remove some zeros from the transaction fee so instead of 0.0005 we would pay 0.5 which is more easily discernible.
It would make me feel richer to. :)

Just curious, where are you moving it to?

The people who took the highest risk when bitcoin wasn't as popular made the highest return now that its getting established. That's usually how it works. A lot of poeple ask "what if" but the truth is, if the level of risk in bitcoin was the same now as it was back then, most people wouldn't buy bitcoin now just like they didn't buy bitcoin then.
20/20 hindsight.

With bitcoin, how can you prove that the money was actually lost and that he doesn't actually own the address that the BTC were sent to?

Can you use bitcoin for ebay payments? Isn't closing paypal account going a little overboard and just making life for yourself a little harder? You gotta admit, paypal has helped move forward the online payment industry even if its not the best thing out there.

I agree that precious metals and bitcoin should not be positioned as foes. In fact, I would hesitate to recommend bitcoin to anyone that I felt may not be able to adequately protect their bitcoins. How would you feel if your life savings were lost due to an over the air update of your phone or a hard drive failure or forgetting a password with no way to recover? I love bitcoin, but one benefit that banks do provide is that they take on the responsibility of securing your wealth for you. Of course that does come with all the drawbacks of a fiat currency and government regulations but having one's wealth secured shouldn't be dismissed as a trivial benefit.

That's possible, but on the flip side, even if the G8 stop using it, what if even one country steps up and decides that they will fully embrace bitcoin? Not all countries need to accept bitcoin for it to be successful. Imagine if just even 1 country fully accepted bitcoin how much of a boost it would give the currency?
And since bitcoin is decentralized and peer to peer, even if the G8 ban it, they can't enforce the ban on their citizens.
