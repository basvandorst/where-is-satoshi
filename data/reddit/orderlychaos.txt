Even with the policies you mentioned, Japan is aiming for an inflation rate of 2%, wich is STILL VERY LOW.
My point stands: OP's worry about economic intervention should NOT be the only cause for pursuing Bitcoin.

Who says so? As long as investors (and especially, speculators) remain confident in Japans solvency, the situation won't get as nearly as dire as with the PIIGS. Remember, Japan is the 3rd biggest economy in the world, and that tends to keep speculators on their toes (in the same way that no one is seriously talking about the US' risk of defaulting, even with high public debt)
Also, not all public debt is negotiated with interest rates indexed to the inflation, and not all public debt is negotiated under variable interest rates. Both meaning that it is not the entirety of the debt that will become more expensive for Japan. It's even a possibility that if they manage to get the economy going, they can earn more revenue than they'll spend paying the increased debt (that's what they're aiming for.

Political scientist here, so let me dissect your question: Is your premise (my country is going to inflate my currency dramatically) valid? Consider that your government has a lot to lose if they make big policy changes drastically, and *instability* is very bad for any state.
So basically, check your sources and make sure you don't make any decision hastily, especially if said decision relies on mere speculation.
