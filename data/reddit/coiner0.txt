Ok, Luke. Which wording should I use then to be correct?
I also see blockchain.info and other blockchain browsers call it *balance*...
@_date: 2016-04-26 07:51:28
Yes, this is true. I have same problems withdrawing my money with ID verified and kicking support every several hours. Takes days to make any withdrawal. And when you complain in chatbox they just ban you. They use any possible reasons not to make withdrawals. They ask to link some other accounts (I don't have other accounts). Looks like they will have the same fate as Cryptsy or Gox.
@_date: 2016-04-23 09:15:18
Why do you call UTXO (what people understand as balance) meaningless information? We know that money is evil by itself but this is how current world works so far. We try to change this world and it takes time. However we need to call *this* somehow, right? We call it balance.
@_date: 2016-04-23 09:32:42
You just call *how much money* someone have in bitcoins a 'meaningless information' for this someone.
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:27:01
Scam again?
@_date: 2016-04-22 23:13:29
Yeah, Luke! I know, this is just **wording for the wide public** (non-Bitcoin people).
Btw, it's an honor for me to have your comment in my post. :-)
P. S. This is Telegram bot for checking unspent output on Bitcoin address.
Now better? :-)

@_date: 2014-02-18 13:45:50
Kraken is number 1 as I understood. Thanks for such a definite reply!
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:01:18
Nice! Thx!!

**UPDATE**: I know that OP_RETURN function is needed. But which software should be used? I am not going to upload any shit to Blockchain. I care of its size. But I need a proof of existence of file made by my own. **Just a small MD5 or SHA string.**
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:37:55
Mtgox have never been a good place neither to keep your bitcoin nor make any deals. Lets not associate mtgox and Bitcoin. Its very sad to hear someone looses faith into Bitcoin because of mtgox failure/scam/whatever

Goooood!! I am so glad it finally happened! We do not need dictator countries in bitcoin ecosystem)
Thank you, CEO of Bitcoin

Where is this field exactly in Blockchain.info transaction screen? What is its name?
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:53:28
I will!
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:35:35
Or may be everything is **vice versa and is very very positive**!
1) Bitcoin is now totally legal in California.
2) Mt Gox finally goes to hell. Lets call it with its name - it's was always a shit. Let the blow up and never ever. Look at other exchanges - price almost did not change at all!
3) As for countries - don't you think we care too much of their attitude to Bitcoin?
4) Fiat numbers and small pieces of paper worth less and less over time.
5) Adoption goes a way slower, but it goes. Infrastructure is not built in 1 day.
... Everyone can continue the positive list.
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:25:35
So what? All that you say is just a **ripple on the surface of Bitcoin ocean**. You better use your lucky chance *to buy low*!
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:44:01
Headlines say they somehow halted deposits or withdrawals. Is it true or this problem is solved?

china-the-protocol. How sad people is so unfamiliar of such differences. And that country China is just a 4th meaning...
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:15:50
Yeah, I mean both credit and debit card - no difference.
Thanks for these links. I checked them and... the conditions are a robbery. It has nothing to compete with the former Russian one. Russian one took only 3% commission and that's it. No verifications, any cards could be used...
Oh, what a harsh world...
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:13:13
Totally approve! Bits are *very good*! **1 BTC = 1 000 000 bits. Let's switch to bits!!**

Bitcoin must stay regulators-free and ID-free.
Yes, this exchange is not so technologically advanced like Kraken, but it works and works good. And they don't need ids.
Though they are continue to be risky.
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:29:58
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:20:12
Yes, it very low for such a great Everything.

We in Russia have no such thing. We can pay with 500 euros bill - 1 second to check in UV. And that's it!
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:06:30
Absolute truth... They are afraid.
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:42:12
Totally agree. 2500 EUR is very low limit to trade easily... So you can buy 2.5 BTC, sell it and that totals for 5 BTC ~ off non-id limit.
@_date: 2014-05-03 20:53:43
What??? Haha. That's not gonna happen during your life.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:28:15
extremely fantastic experience working with kraken! I am grateful that you discovered it to me!
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:50:11
good explanation, thank you.
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:01:03
Yes, it's digital. It must have zero cost. It's 2015 now.
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:02:09
blockchain will evolve. We  should overcome any limits.
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:04:10
we do not need any altcoins. Bitcoin can evolve. Bitcoin is enough, thank you.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:17:21
Why bitcoin needs 10 minutes to pack a block while some other need 2-5 sec?
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:19:32
Everyone should hear your words. let 2015 be a special year!
@_date: 2015-01-25 09:06:59
trx fees are such a small amount in block compared to 25 BTC so that it can be 0.00000001.
@_date: 2015-01-25 09:07:46


are you sure?)
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:00:33
These $0.017 will become $170,000 later.
@_date: 2015-01-25 09:03:56
however almost all applications take 0.0001 minimum fee. do no know apps who let you choose own fee.
@_date: 2015-01-25 09:09:29


yes, that is why we can make is lowest right now. it is insignificant.
@_date: 2015-01-25 09:04:46
0.00000001 should stop them as well. and we maybe need to make a commission obligatory.
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:27:14
It was still 98 btc. So it is.
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:03:50
champagne problem :-) nicely put
@_date: 2016-11-08 22:04:42
It's not SEPA slow, it's Kraken slow to put your funds into account. They do it very often.
Quite possibly they use your money while it is in limbo.
@_date: 2016-11-08 22:08:35
You've been xapped. Yes. They never reply. Never again.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:16:31

@_date: 2015-08-13 12:51:03
Na. Buggy.
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:01:32
Haha... Only really stupid would buy.
@_date: 2015-08-12 19:05:14
Not awesome at all. Use it until your bitcoins are locked for no reason. Coinbase, Circle - both lock for no reason. Lots of horror stories. Hell no! Use Copay.io
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:15:23
What sort of identity are you talking about? Linking to what? The service doesn't ask for any information. And yes, FREE +0.2%. This is a small amount, but it is **free**. Free bitcoins, Carl!
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:51:20
Thank you! I hope so too!
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:09:05
bla bla bla. This not what Bitcoin was created. It was created to prevent blocking of any kind.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:52:59
Not exactly. The coins I need are new coins straight from the miner.
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:27:50
I am not very experienced in scams, but so far I haven't seen any scam offers like this. Possibly I am wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:04:14
I have enough coins to cover several full blocks. But there is no way yet to implement this cover. Let's wait for smart contracts to help. But now we still have to deal with some extent of trust. We are waiting for systems to eliminate it.
@_date: 2015-08-12 19:03:31
You are absolutely right.
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:13:02
Yes, I am still thinking on how to automate it. I don't know how to make automatic bitcoin address generation for mining after asking for clients bitcoin address to send payment. I really don't need this emailing stuff. Do you know how to do it?
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:40:05
Yes, but I already explored the theme. There are enough for me people who are ok with this premium. And 0.2% is what I can afford myself to pay for it. As I already said for me it is not the anonymity issue. Consider me as a *digital numismatist*.
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:42:21
You mean Eligius is faking information?
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:19:18
You know, this is not my goal. For me it is not a privacy concern or any sort of washing. It is just my **fad** to have shiny coins from the mint, although really there is no difference in coins. All coins will become dirty due to the existence of limit of 21 million.
So I won't write that stuff about coins-without-history - because there is no such purpose. Those who have - they clearly write it like BlockTrail that they wash coins. And I want to keep these shiny coins for myself.
@_date: 2015-07-23 18:01:34
sorry for asking too many questions... which escrows are trustable?
@_date: 2015-07-24 03:17:03
Nothing illegal.
Why would anyone get +0.2% bitcoins free? Because it is free bitcoins!
@_date: 2015-08-09 23:23:43
Doing what? Thinking how to automate or this service at all? If the latter - it is explained upper in the tread after "Good cover." TLDR: Just a fad.
@_date: 2015-07-18 11:42:06
I think lite chineese pyramid owner sold a bit. Or the owners of exchange stolen some funds. They do it often.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:48:17
Yes, that is what I say. One can only try and then see it works as promised.
The same way you work with mining pools: first you do work, then you are paid. Same way is stores: first you pay, then you take goods. If you know any mechanism to secure clients please share with us. Maybe you are genius and we all are fools.

Because it worked very good before.  The were no reasons to suspect anything wrong.
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:00:56
It takes 20 minutes to swap. I see no risk.
@_date: 2015-07-23 15:41:28
Comparable to 0.2% or crazy 10%?
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:44:55
I panic, because as I wrote in my post the keys are not extractable. And their wiki says about this bug. No file is given after exporting.

Don't mess! This is not about how bitcoin works.
The risk is minimal. You won't mine the whole block at once, right?

And BitFury is RUSSIAN company, not Georgian, which is also a part of former Russian Empire. Russia sells electricity to Georgia, Armenia and other neighbor countiries almost for free, that is why mining is profitable there.
