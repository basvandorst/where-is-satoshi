I'd say that it's mostly diven by uncertainties in stock markets and real estate prices. But it doesn't really matter, my point was that market capitalization does not ensure low volatility.

Deflation happens for other reasons though. Say you have 100 bananas and 100 bitcoins. Now each banana costs 1 bitcoin. But what if your economy grows by 10 %? Now you have 110 bananas but still the same amount of money, so each banana costs 0.9 bitcoins. So you can buy more goods for one bitcoin than before. It doesn't matter how much you fraction your bitcoins.

It doesn't necessarily mean it's bad code though. Nginx can handle much higher load than, say, a database or disk i/o.

Silver and gold have market caps in trillions, and yet have high volatility. In fact, even for an adopted currency low volatility is not a given, central banks buy or sell currencies at a loss for days to prevent huge swings. Read on central banks currency interventions.
I think volatility is largely the result of bitcoins being perceived as commodity instead of currency.

Sorry, but why do you sum them up? It's not how it works. What these numbers mean, is that, at least according to this data, purchasing power of a median income increased 11.87/7.8 = 1.52.

Actually, there's a good reason to have lots of money and not spending it. Because the more money you have, the more you earn, so you can only spend a certain amount and keep the rest to make it earn even more money.

Sort of, yes. But it might be the reason why it won't be adopted. Because it's designed this way there's no incentive to spend it, if you can keep your money and they will increase in value. And if it gets adopted, deflation will be proportional to economic growth.

Except that it's not how economy works, you can't operate in a bubble. You (or other agents) still have to buy stuff from economies with other currencies. When Russia had hyperinflation in 1990s, people preferred being paid in dollars and a lot of businesses operated in dollars. It only changed when exchanges rates became more reliable.

Don't be stupid. 10-15 % a year means doubling the prices every 7 and 5 years respectively.

Yep, it's actually very interesting that the scale is almost exactly logarithmical. 
Btw, does this analysis exclude wallets that haven't been used for 2-3 years?

And this is exactly what you would expect with inflation of 4-5%. 30513/2570 = 11.87 ; (1 + 0.047)^54 = 11.94 .

This was my impression as well. So far I don't see how it can possibly work. The fixed amount of money might sound good in theory, but it's not going to work in practice.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:25:59
You can call it whatever you want, let's call it things that you can buy instead of GDP. If the number of things that you can buy increases then you have deflation. And it doesn't matter whether the supply is fixed or not, it will still deflate in relative terms, because you'll have more stuff that you can buy.
Deflation is not a dirty word, but it's bad for economy. If you have huge savings, then you can just sit on this pile of money and don't do anything with it - it will still grow. On the other hand, if you have inflation, then you have to put your money in some investments just to stay even. This is why inflation stimulates economy, and deflation does the opposite.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:31:30
Yes, and this is exactly what I was trying to tell. If one bitcoin represents a fixed percentage of GDP and GDP grows, then in terms of real products it will be valued more. It is deflation.


Yes, I was talking about adoption stage, it can be a serious obstacle in its transition to a functioning currency.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:45:24
I agree, it can find its niche. Some people think it can replace other currencies, and I was arguing that it can't. As far as I know, there is strong consensus among economists that pretty much any amount of deflation is bad for economy.
