What's stupid about it?

Doing 5 transactions is more expensive than holding the blockchain for 5 years today. Thx for adding a number perspective.

Unfortunately, that's the harsh truth.

Sorry, I should have been more clear, I was talking RAM. Server grade, ECC, DDR3.

Even worse. I bought 128GiB last week for 250 eur. Why would you want to use an overpriced underpowered laptop to make a point?

I won $300.

Your bug, my feature

I prefer not to disclose, but I can tell you I have way more money in bitcoins than in regular currencies.

~300BTC. I spent some on lottery, unsuccessfully.

Over 4usd now.
I'm rich.

Word. OP is taking a vague shot at Jeff and all the shit he smeared literally applies to Blockstream. I prefer agreement among multiple, wildly different companies that run different types of businesses, than the dictation of a particular one. Seriously, guys, you can send all the Bitcoin you can to me, I still won't support Adam after his approach to the problem.

A half assed transaction architecture would run thousands of transactions (not just orders) per second on commodity hardware.

I read up to lawyer. No international law lawyer will help you for that amount. If you want to shake him up tho, pm.
