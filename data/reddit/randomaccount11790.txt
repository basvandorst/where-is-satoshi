I prefer to say fuck the people who wanna tax my crypto. I would rather not pay them ever because bitcoin isn't owned by them hence I don't owe them anything. Also, taxation is theft.

If this is true, then BTC is gonna moon. Every time tether prints out more fake money it seems to have a impact on the price but if all the people start dumping tether because of the multiple lawsuits against them I wouldn't be surprised and I would be happy for the ride up :)

and it has multiple lawsuits against the company for fraud, money laundering and much much more.

Its the same in Europe. When I took Ubers, lyfts and taxis almost every single driver knew about and/or has bitcoin and even some would accept it surprisingly.

AUD is inflated more than the USD

Hoarding can go wrong. Think of the lira in Italy a long time ago before they got rid of it. Anyone holding it pretty much went worthless over a rather quick timespan. So if USD goes belly up or inflates which is happening then holding cash would be a mistake. Only hold what you need. Take out your profits and re-invest. I keep 65% bitcoin and the other part cash/gold and other items of value.

I have actually set up several car dealerships through out the southeast part of florida to accept bitcoin via bitpay which is relatively easy and actually bought my porsche with BTC :)

You have to raise you're credit and you can hopefully get a high limit card. For example my credit is around 800 and my max out is $25k +/-  on CC's but I rarely use them.

Keep cold hard cash (but don't fully exit the bitcoin market, only amount that you need) unless you can buy with bitcoin. Banks are less and less doing loans. Don't buy something you can't outright afford but that's just my opinion.

Bump this up. I've been trading since late 2012 and I have seen hundreds maybe thousands of customers of mine of have told me about scams which actually led me to write a ebook on how to avoid scams with crypto. SOOO many newbs that get scammed then think its bitcoins fault for their stupidity.

I understand the economic standpoint and being frugal about buying a "new" car but what if he is way in the net profit for all we know. But then again if I was buying a car, I buy one thats has low mileage, a few years off the newest cars which takes a big hit of money off that I would have otherwise been taking. I will never finance a new expensive car. Thats not how you get your money to work for you. But say the car is only 10k? Which most likely is NOT new if its 10k. That is reasonable and not too expensive.

I have read many places about money becoming digital by 2020 but it will be completely centralized in whatever way they manage it.

My bank, the people that actually work there I have spoken too over the phone for larger BTC transactions at TD's bank actually told me how they invest in crypto and such. I have used coinbase and other exchanges with TD and never ever had a problem.

Seems like "Umerca" is the  trading country for BTC around the world (according to bitcoinwisdom) but yeah, I have heard of that happening. I personally haven't had problems of getting 20k cash out of the bank. Of course they gotta file a paper for KYC/AML laws but its attainable. I used to bank with BoA years ago before they banned me for using bitcoin and I had a withdrawal limit of $2500/day at the atm.
