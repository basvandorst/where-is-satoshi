Well fiat's been reliable all my life, and I expect it to be reliable at least until I'm dead and gone.. that's good enough for me :) I don't need it to be any more reliable than that.
You do bleed a bit of value but then again, you are always adding value to your life, no? if you net it out, it doesn't really bleed that much.

Which is all very well, but can I ask you this question, will Bitcoin still be around in five years? ten years? twenty? fifty? because I guarantee you Con Ed will be.   
Between Con Ed and Bitcoin, can you give me your honest opinion on which one will be more likely to last fifty or sixty years?

Bit of a stretch to call it "reliable" isn't it?

You've actually never heard of [Con Ed]( ? that's interesting. And I will make you that guarantee, because I know it will. I have to go AFK now, but feel free to look it up anytime in your life, I guarantee you they will still be around.

Okay so suppose you invested it in some solid blue-chip and lived off the dividends (let's take Con Ed for example) how much would you have lost?
Also you're assuming inflation of 3.5% a year, which is a little high don't you think? unless you have the reliable sources to back it up.

I said Amazon was dumb when it was first founded - I don't use it. Who wants to pay top dollar for something you can get for half the price here in store, and then wait weeks for it to arrive, lets not even talk about returns. 
I said the iPad was dumb when it was first created - it still is. Netflix has crap movies, all the good ones are never there until months or years after they are released. Even if I thought Netflix was cool, Why would I pay that much for a device to watch Netflix on?
I said Netflix was dumb when it sent dvds - I still do. 
I said bitcoin is dumb. That will never work - still doesn't (unless you count all sorts of shady work.)  
In short, \*I\* think it's dumb. It might work for someone else, and if it does more power to them. It's still dumb to me though.

You might be investigated by the authorities as a "person of interest" so you might as well be prepared for that.

So, out of curiosity which coin do you think will be the world reserve currency, and why?
