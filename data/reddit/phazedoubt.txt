Me too! I was actually surprised I could do that. I love that my USAA allows me to keep up with all of my other depository accounts also.

Might be something to explore with blockchain.info

Why do you say that?

I lost several bitcoins on Mt. Gox and never bothered getting in on the bankruptcy because it wasn't worth it at the time...

Same thing happened to Regions bank about 2 weeks ago.  Seems to be common lately.  109.201.133.65 host file edit works for me.

I agree, that's why i said it can only be correlative and not causative for this reason. However, given the nature of money and how economies work, it would be a pretty HUGE coincidence for a nation to announce that it will be taxing deposits and closing it's banks for an extended period of time, while at the same time the value of this unregulated financial instrument soars.

True, but i'm not talking about the ones with 100,000 euro in the bank.  i'm talking about the very wealthy.  The ones with the means to move the price that fast.  I doubt that many of those with 100,000 would consider doing something even more risky than taking the loss by moving their money (in most cases the majority of their wealth) into a very new technology.


Here's to early adopters!

Yep.  I'm not an anarchist or a naysayer of government, but when you look at the complete and total ineptness of government to stay true and not bow to the few it makes me want to hedge my bets.  It is scary though at the same time because the one problem with democracy is people.  When everyone has a say it can be hard to get things done.
