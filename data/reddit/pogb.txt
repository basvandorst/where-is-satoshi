Nice work with this review of poloniex. I've actually learned some interesting facts that I was previously unaware of.
TBH I always thought the owner/CEO of Poloniex was publicly known. Though this assessment raises the question for the first time... So this Tristan D’Agosta guy, would you say it's a pseudoname or someone's real name? There's litterally no interviews of him anywhere on Youtube! For an exchange that gets over 50 million in monthly hits, that's making me pretty nervous.

Great, thanks. That's a rather helpful, and easy to read list of sites for people searching how to buy bitcoin instantly. It would be nice to see which country each service is operating from ( it seems most are in the UK, USA, or Canada) and how much they charge. I've bookmarked it for future reference. 
I see there are also sites to buy bitcoin with paypal (I'd says fees are even higher than with a card, so best to stick with traditional deposit methods). And yes - I've been hearing that the bank transfer through SEPA would be the fastest way to go about acquiring btc. There seems to be some good &amp; trustworthy sites for this.

A nice recommendation. I'm looking through circle (which seems straightforward to use), and 5 minutes does indeed seem pretty instant to me. Although sometimes it may seem better to buy without verification, I think the process on this site is very efficient. Besides, it seems that there is a big push for 'know your customer' regulation on big exchanges. This means trustworthy site is safer in the long run compared to a no verification purchase, so that's good. I saw that they also provide an app. Interesting.

Ok, 24hrs seems quick. Thanks for the advice.

Ok, great to know that GDAX is linked to Coinbase. While it may be simpler to use the latter for beginners, its good to know that the former is available when ready to progress and receive cheap fees as well.
Just checked out Kraken, this could be a nice option indeed. It has lots of good reviews and seems very oriented towards serious buyers.

Interesting. While this time round I'm not looking for information on how to buy bitcoin with cash, I'll keep the bitcoin atms and localbitcoins site in mind. How does one go about finding an atm near home? Would they exist in every western country (say New Zealand, India, or Australia)?

Hi thank you &amp; good to hear that it is possible to buy btc instantly with a SEPA transfer. I'm seeing people saying that using a bank card (or even paypal) is generally better for smaller volume purchases. I've checked out bitstamp, and since we are mostly European based, this could be really useful. Since they're located in London I'd see this a major trust factor for a bitcoin newcomer. Do you know how fast they process deposits, and is the following transaction instant or would there be a required waiting time?
@_date: 2016-10-18 12:00:14
Noted. And how fast was the process in all? This would be really helpful.

Thanks for the detailed comparison and explanation here. It seems we're better off using a bank transfer in the long run as most want to buy over 10k usd worth (or euros). Since we are in the UK most also have USA &amp; European bank accounts, so using a different currency to GBP should be fine. 


Yes, I see. Even though using a credit card may allow them to buy instantly, it's going to be way cheaper to do a SEPA. And the process seems fast enough.

Cool - OTC would be something we would look into. Especially if there are cheaper rates. I'll check it out and reach out if any questions.
