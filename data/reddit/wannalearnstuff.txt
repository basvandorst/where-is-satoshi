hedge fiat to crypto due to impending war?! wow. that's one I haven't heard.
Do you know why that is the logical step to many of them? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:04:59
what exactly are the chinese laws with crypto? i know there is some level of a ban, but what exactly is banned?
is it only mining? 
but people in china can participate in purchasing crypto, but storing it on korean exchanges?

i understand that they are the same thing, but what I'm not understanding is people saying to measure your alt coin gains by satoshi. does that make sense what i'm asking? or am i mistaken about something?
would love to figure this out if you have some input!!!
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:36:53
Thank you. 
Do I have the general premise right that people overcomplicate measuring gains in Satoshi?
Can it be as simple as, "hey, look and see if the USD gain you made on your alt coin is more than the USD gain you would have made had you kept the bitcoin amount you used to exchange for the alt, in order to know if you made a good choice to exchange that amount of btc for the alt you obtained"?

yeah i will love to be on the moon too dude lol; i am just trying to figure out if moon can be with alts.
a lot of people say "don't calculate gains on alts by usd, calculate by satoshi." what exactly does that mean if you could share please? it would mean alot.

haha no worries. i appreciate your thoughts. we all have something to contribute! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:27:29
how do you see that view? it's like we have completely different interfaces. that section you are pointing to doesn't exist in my account. instead, that area is where my open orders and fills are.

for your answer to number 2, would that include if you bought bitcoin off gemini and moved it to a hardware wallet?

so i keep seeing veterans talk about hodl and that they've been through this drill before so it's going to be fine.
but isn't this time different? because it's a civil war? and from what i know, which i'm assuming isn't false propaganda, is that bitcoin cash is faster and with lower transaction fees?  
so don't those factors make this a considerably different semi-crash for the bitcoin price than other times given those factors? or have their been other very similar situations/forks? 
asking as a noob and would like to learn more. i'm seriously considering dumping some btc to get some bitcoin cash as a hedging strategy against a bitcoin crash if people move over to bitcoin cash since it apparently is faster and with lower transaction fees.

hmmm ok. thank you. 
lots of terms in the second to last paragraph fly over my head since i'm kind new so i'll have to do a lot of research.
but it seems overall your answer/opinion to my question is "fuck no" to hedging against a bitcoin crash by buying bitcoin cash; is that right? 
thanks a lot by the way. i'll look into all of this.

yeah dude its nuts. 
i saw the docu on netflix on bitcoin and noticed them talking about how libertarians love bitcion. 
it's quite a phenomenon that people are getting emotionally entangled with the belief of what it can do for the world. I suppose at times it's an extension of expressing their world view/political beliefs the way it seems libertarians do with bitcoin. 
Perhaps I should buy into the idea as well of how much good it can do. I believe it can do good. But I'm scared/skeptical if it can reach that pinnacle because of government regulation and ultra wealthy people finding the means to take it all for themselves. 
But who knows? Maybe I don't know enough. Perhaps government regulation won't come crashing down on it, and the powers that be actually believe it can be beneficial. Or perhaps they believe bitcoin/crypto is inevitable and are making moves to prepare for it, similar to how the oil industry keeps working in oil, but if you read their reports, basically all of them know renewable energy is inevitable, and they are making investments right now to evolve and stay alive with the eventual transition.

interesting. are you trying to say that bitcoin cash is a pure scam? very rich people propagandizing it as the solution to bitcoin's problems, but really they had planned a get rich quick pump and dump that would be further enhanced by people buying into their propaganda? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:45:27
So serious question because I'm trying to learn more:
What is bitcoin core doing to make things scalable and make sure its transaction speeds are faster and fees are lower than bitcoincash? 
In the long term, can't bitcoin cash just readjust the technical side so that it can scale? Thus making it legitimate? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:38:30
gotcha thanks. 
I don't doubt veteran status knows more than me. What I'm having trouble separating on this sub is those who are giving expert/veteran/unbiased advice and people who are political and overly zealous with their advice. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:23:06
is bitcoin cash a viable hedging strategy for if bitcoin crashes? im new so just a little scared of the volatility so pondering if i should hodl while at least getting some kind of protection against a crash by buying into bitcoin cash to an extent just in case it does become the preferred coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:12:32
what exactly does that mean? when i plug in my hardware wallet will it have a pop up that says "oh by the way, here are keys to get your b2x since you own bitcoin?"
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:09:29
i feel like i'm talking with satoshi nakamoto purposely giving cryptic messages behind his grand plans. are you in fact, THE, satoshi nakomoto?!
I'm so lost on it bro. Why wouldn't there be a b2x going into the marketplace when they already have a date set and scared away? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:32:41
interesting. you're the first person I've heard mention the possibility of B2X not even getting in the market. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:11:42
didn't think of that. i don't have much experience declaring assets and having them taxed. how much do you think that tax bill will be? thank you for your help. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:30:20
wait what?! lol.
I thought Nov. 16th there is going to be a hard fork?! so confused.
