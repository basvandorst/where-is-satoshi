Lol, is this comment meant to be serious?

I’ve heard multiple billionaires discuss their skepticism on it being a currency...yet...but that in the meantime it’s “underestimated” (Peter Thiel) as an alternative to gold for storing ones wealth. That puts a real price target on bitcoin in the multiple hundreds of thousands. Especially considering its increased adoption and polls showing gen-z and millennials preferring it to gold. So, I’m going to diversify like any good investor and make sure I have a little of this bitcoin just in case all these wealthy ppl and financial institutions jumping on board know more about money than me.

Why didn’t you hypothetically buy more?
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:56:45
You can easily tell based on the angle of this chart that it will peak above $100k and never go higher. Pretty lame chart.

Close but I’m not treating it like a stock. It’s another asset class like gold. I’m not buying stock in bitcoin. It’s not a company. And, it could potentially work as currency as well despite that not being where it’s currently at. You need to do a little research on how real money works. And how many layers fiat currency has on it to make it work as fast as it currently does. Credit cards are like 5 layers removed and yet, I’m sure you’ve put your trust in one before. It’s quite easy for layers to be added to bitcoin to make it faster, cheaper and safer to use. Research the lightning network. That’s the first real layer being added to bitcoin and it already makes it cheaper/faster to use as currency. This is only going to keep happening. 
Again, for now, look at it as gold alternative and I’d be surprised if it didn’t start making more sense to you as a place to store a minor amount of money that you’d be okay with losing if all these pretty reputable ppl and financial institutions are wrong about it.
That said, I don’t own any.

I call bs on you following for years through bubbles (plural) and still coming to your conclusion. If true, you surely would have bought in and became quite well off from it. Or, you didn’t buy like you said and in that case...you missed out on a lot of money. You even missed out on money if you bought at the top of the second to last bubble and sold at the bottom of the last 2017 one.

That’s a lot to dump into bitcoin at this moment and simultaneously way too much for a ring. My best friend got a great ring for just $3K. If your girlfriend was expecting you to drop $25k on one then she’s not the type that’s going to appreciate 2 highly speculative assets instead, lol.

During the 2013 SXSW I had decided I was finally going to purchase 5 bitcoin. I was so confused about how to buy them online but during that sxsw there was a bitcoin ATM in town. It was the last day and was a rainy day and I realized a scavenger hunt going on for a free iPad would have very few participants so I did that instead, and won! It was awesome. Ultimately, I clearly lost, lol
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:22:19
Yes, and just a reminder that the wealthy and institutions see bitcoin as a Gold similar asset class to store ones wealth. They don’t care if it will work as a currency. It already works great as a store of wealth that’s not connected to the rest of the economy and is therefore, theoretically, safe in case of a recession. This puts bitcoins value in the 6 figures

Diversification as in not everything in crypto. Risky to put it all on one asset
@_date: 2019-06-25 00:10:42
500 divided by current price of bitcoin. Then multiply that number by 100. That’s the percentage of 1 bitcoin you’d have. So, whatever the price of bitcoin is at a later date, you would figure out the value of your holdings based on that percentage. Say you own 10% and price went to 20,000, then you’d have 10% of that (2k).

With the angle of that rainbow it would never rise above $100k w/o being a bubble, right? That’s what it looks like to me.

Yep, he has been calling the top for weeks.

This must have been on the way down. Bitcoin was like $16k before Those alts went up like that.

You also should look at it as an alternative to gold as a store of wealth. The currency part of it is really not there yet, partially because of what you’ve pointed out. The billionaires of the world are not betting on it replacing USD. Rather, it’s seen as replacing gold for now. This is also why it’s somewhat silly to bet on the altcoins. Bitcoin is where the money is going for now and it has a clear valuation target - replacing gold would make it around $350k. Not sure how one puts a value on the others.
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:21:44
People were saying the same thing at 8k. Bitcoin does what it wants. Good luck w/e you decide

Yes, if you continue selling bikes for bitcoin and the IRS realizes you aren’t paying taxes, you’ll be fined and a cop will arrest you. John Mcafee is currently on the run for not paying taxes. Are you a millionaire that can afford to live out the rest of your life on a yacht running from the cops? More likely, you’ll just become homeless and fucked. I’m all for this bitcoin future but it has a very very long way to go. See if it can replace gold as a back-up store of wealth first.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:10:00
Why not just invest 10% of that? Why do you have to go all in on some conspiracy? I’d say diversification is a safer choice

I just spoke with the bitcoin people. They said yah, it’s coming but you may as well cash out now because they don’t want you. Sorry man.
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:35:36
Probably because it’s legit confusing, especially if you’re new to the space, and they don’t want to sound like pretentious douches. Personally, I find the way they did this to be a little more genuine and less likely to make their audience feel dumb and scared. Keep in mind, they’re an opinion news channel and their audience isn’t all tech/finance ppl.

Yes, begin investing in your own bizs. When you get to the point where you’re profiting big every single day, you’ll realize you yourself can be your highest appreciating asset. And it only gets easier with experience.

Hopefully with these layers being added to it, like the lightning network, things like losing your wallet will be solvable at some point but I have no idea. Currently, I have doubts about a true cryptocurrency really working. That said, bitcoin as a store of value does have real merit, so far. And millennials and gen z seem to favor it over gold as an alternative place to store ones money as a way to diversify and keep a portion of your wealth safe from inflation, recession, housing market crash, etc. like gold...but easier to use. One day, maybe it could replace the USD, but it has to replace gold first really. 
That said, look into the lightning network. Just like visa is like 3-4 layers removed from your actual govts currency and works great, the lightning network is similar but more like 1 layer removed from the actual bitcoin blockchain. As solves like that continue to occur through innovation maybe it could also one day be like an actual replacement to fiat currency, 
I don’t think it’s there yet though. For now, just a good alternative to gold and if the younger generations continue to feel that way the price of bitcoin will continue to rise. Stick with the top coin. Maybe Ethereum as more speculation as it’s having the most platforms built on it. But I’m not certain how to place value on Ethereum currently - just that it rises with bitcoin. Until it has an actual highly adopted decentralized app built on it, it seems overvalued...just not quite as overvalued as everything else.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:18:32
As long as you’re cool with losing that amount if it drops then go right ahead. Nobody knows if that will happen or if it will keep going up.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:11:57
It’s still up today. Are you saying you bought earlier today when it was higher?
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:23:42
Makes sense. And like I said, I don’t know a lot. This is just my average dum dum opinion :)
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:50:16
Just like there are many precious gems and metals. That said, there is still only one gold because that’s what we chose to represent money and our way to store wealth. Just like, there’s a billion cryptocurrencies but just one bitcoin. It’s the winner because of popularity. I’ve been trying to pay attention to this stuff for a couple years (while running a biz) and I couldn’t possibly understand all of these other coins and such. The average person has heard of bitcoin and they will never have time to learn about the rest. The global elite have chosen bitcoin so it seems that’s the winner as digital gold. If that materializes, cool. If not, well, very little lost if you don’t invest foolishly. Ethereum is our digital oil, and I think the question is still out there if one of these things becomes an actual cryptocurrency. For now, I think it’s safe to say that bitcoin is a store of wealth though.
