In my case, my friend introduced BTC to me and I was too dumb not to realize its future value. At that time, he had 5000 btc and he even offered to give me 100 btc. Back to the present, he is a secret multi-millionaire in this third world country somewhere in Asia.

We are approaching at 4k mark
@_date: 2019-03-06 00:39:09
I hope the new support mark is at 4k.
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:41:51

@_date: 2019-03-07 00:37:33

@_date: 2019-03-29 13:43:30
I will go back here after 5.8k. Lol
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:25:06
You are not the only one, bro

Darn! That dump
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:52:24
Go 5k
@_date: 2018-10-01 06:54:15
In my personal opinion, we will surpass the 8k mark by the end of December. These past few days the price of the coin is constant between 6.4-6.5k. Hopefully, last week of October or 1st week of November, the price will be around 7-7.2k. What do you think so? P.S No bash please.
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:50:04
I believe in you, bro
@_date: 2019-03-31 12:49:31
I hope it will cross 4.2k mark
@_date: 2019-03-06 08:02:58
Too greedy bro
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:35:25

@_date: 2019-10-23 23:23:30
It is because of this meme.
@_date: 2019-10-23 23:22:27
Deym! You got it right.
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:54:15
The price tumbled down. Sorry guys it is my fault. I fell asleep.
@_date: 2019-02-24 06:58:44
I totally agree with you, brother.
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:30:54
It is ❤️ imagine from 2.5k last December to 10k in few days
@_date: 2019-04-02 10:29:13
Please! But do not be greedy, I would be very happy if it stabizes at 5k
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:59:47
Yas, I got in Dec 2017. Well, luck was not at my side. It was my fault that I fomoed.

@_date: 2019-05-14 02:09:21
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:21:37
It is due to FOMO-ing of people to bitcoin resulted to selling of altcoins in exchange of btc.
