The increasing anger from this crowd is directly proportional to bitcoin becoming a standard Thing.  Its a natural reaction when something you have summed up in your head as a ridiculous, passing fad, is increasingly being backed by the general public.  Its moved from being limited to supernerd anarchists ("stupid idiots; at least youre over there and away from me") to general adoption ([looking around, over shoulder] "you're all f**king delusional; one of us is batshit crazy and it sure as hell ain't me!!!").  
This is a good thing.

Hi! How do u setup to call bread wallet? Mine goes to coin base...

Yah, used it twice. Very nice. Ran into same problem moving change back to wallet. $0.50 turned into $0.40.  Sent a support note.

Thanks that's what I figured...it's cool app and used it twice.  Did get this weird thing when trying to get change back to my wallet, and instead of $0.50, I received $0.40.  I sent them a support question on this, if this was a glitch or real (20% short on change)...hoping it's the former

Noob here. If I understand correctly the keys I have now for x amount of coins will be able to transact after the fork.  If so, seems like the fork to xt will be a process change and not a product change.... ie. not getting why it's being categorized as an altcoin
