Electrum is a bitcoin client that creates a deterministic wallet based on a sequence of memorizable words. This allows you to recover the wallet if you accidentally lose/delete it.
Tails i think is a security oriented linux distro.
And I'm assuming he means installing the distro with electrum on a USB stick?

But if the client uses a coinkite card, they can make a transaction to the merchant without printing any paper?

I think the proverb doesn't mean the mathematical best time, but what time is it intrinsically best for the person. The person shouldn't get regretful over a past event they cannot change, instead they should look to the potential of the future.
But if this proverb confused you enough to make me type this out,  then it's a pretty weak proverb.

any chance I could use your fork for my paper wallets?

I bought in at 200$, I'm a bit peeved at the price drop,  but my purchase was based more as a learning experience. I wanted to know how to use bitcoin before I seriously commit to it.  
Besides,  it's good to have a small fund in case I encounter a situation in which I need to use bitcoin. Especially since purchasing it is such a time consuming hassle.

I don't quite understand what's going on here, is he printing the BTC/LTC public addresses of his own coinkite account?, or are the public addresses for the merchant account so that you can pay with your smartphone?
