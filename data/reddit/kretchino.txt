That's a good question and indeed it seems strange, however the screen caps are real. Maybe bitcointicker.co's data is flawed or my interpretation of their graphics is wrong.  
Another explanation could be market fee manipulation to get us used to paying higher fees. With a 12,5btc reward per block, they don't really need the fees which amount to maximum 1btc/blk, so filling a block with fake transactions will only cost them 1btc leaving them 10,5btc  out of the potential 13,5btc if blocks were full of real user txs...

If the computers and networks can manage the load implied by such blocksizes for handling thousands of transactions per second then the fees wouldn't need to be very high to pay off the miners. I just think that the infrastructure won't be able to handle it.

Bitcoin is like gold in the way it is "mined" and can not be inflated by quantitative easing decided by central banks. However gold reserves are held by the central banks who can manipulate it price at will.  
Bitcoin is meant to be CASH, mined by anyone and usable by all, if not, it's value is but an illusion create by speculation.

infrastructure: Computers and networks that build up the nodes which synchronize between each other.  
Huge blocks will only work on huge nodes leading to fewer nodes and more centralization which in turn means less security as it becomes easier to attack a few nodes and bring down the network.

I understand that, but isn't BU a hard fork also? If Segwit is "only" a soft fork why does it need 95% of miner support to activate? if not for the risk of creating 2 chains in the same manner?  
If forking is necessary to scale wouldn't 5 minute blocks be easier and safer? Miners wouldn't fear loosing fees with off-chain transactions on lightning networks, users would get more capacity and faster confirmations, and the risk of centralization due to bigger block be mitigated?

Exchanges have to agree which chain is bitcoin since all alt-coins prices are relative to BTC. If they don't it becomes impossible for users to know and compare prices between exchanges as they become untrustworthy. That's why I'm moving all my coins out of the exchange I use until the situation becomes clear.  
Let us users send a clear message to the exchanges that will then send a clear message to the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:51:49
When I first learnt about bitcoin, the coolest aspects for me as a developer were decentralization and immutability. That is what I bought and that is what I'm getting. Maybe it could be doing better if upgraded but I much prefer it  stays to way it is for the time being.  
The Litecoin experience shows that even when there's no competing LU version or need for bigger blocks with 4X the throughput of btc, and a strong community support behind Charlie for pushing Segwit, ltc miners clearly don't wish to upgrade. There's some logic behind this but I won't speculate on their reasons. Also I don't think that the politics between reddit subs have much impact as most users worldwide don't speak English and probably don't have the time it takes to follow all the news (even I find it difficult).  For those who do follow, I'd say the message they're getting is that is impossible for anyone to take control of bitcoin no matter how much social engineering they invest and I kind of like that too.  
I don't think setting up a governance model makes any sense as it would be like having a FED and would go against what bitcoin was designed for.  If ever bigger blocks were needed, it would probably be quite easy for the miners to copy the Core code base and make the changes themselves with or without Segwit and if anybody wishes to fork the blockchain, there's nothing stopping them, so best let it be.  
And last, the only hardfork I'd support would be Charlie's idea of changing the PoW algo to "fire" all the miners if ever it's proven that they are being coerced by government to restrain mass adoption and restore mining operations with the users on standard equipment.
@_date: 2017-03-01 23:13:02
I agree, but by changing the POW algorithm to something that's gpu or cpu based, then the asic-sha256 miners become obsolete and Jihan Wu can throw out all of Bitmain's hardware which can not be used to attack  the new chain.  
In a free market financed by users, the miners role is to provide what the users want or be replaced as Charlie Lee puts it. Let's wait and see how it works out on litecoin first...
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:18:16

It's clear as water: For miners to optimize their profit they need to control the fees and to control the fees they need to control the blocksize.

I have more or less the same understanding as you (not sure LN is actually considered a sidechain) but Counterparty is also a sidechain and isn't affected by the malleability problem as far as I know. Counterparty serves for many altcoins such as Pepecash, Storjx, Scotcoin, etc...  
So if Counterparty transactions being secured by the btc blockchain are safe, wouldn't it be possible to add LN features to those altcoins?

@_date: 2017-03-15 17:01:17
Nice post but won't work imho.  
- **Superior Technology:** I agree that superior technology doesn't always prevail (cf: Microsoft Windows). But in the case of bitcoin, anything but the best could cost us $20B!  
- **Politics:** I agree that the technological differences between Segwit and BU have been exposed more than enough and the actual situation is all about a political takeover of bitcoin in the most dangerous way: Hardforking with bugged software that could cost us $20B!  
 
- Leadership: The only leadership needed is in the hands of the devs that have a commit access to the github repository. Anybody who wants to contribute must submit his code to one of these devs and join in his "chain of trust". That's how open-source projects work (cf: Linus Torvalds and the Linux project). Running code that hasn't been properly reviewed and allowing anyone to commit changes to the project could cost us $20B!  
If you still have any doubts listen to what other experts, who are on neither side have to say, like Andreas Antonopoulos or Charlie Lee. They are other bitcoin implementations that don't cause any problems such as Bcoin so the problem doesn't lie with Core.  
Talking to the miners is also a waste of time, they know their business and are running it in their best interest. Charlie Lee tried with no luck. Also I don't see how you can pull 3 names from a list and call them leaders; they will never be considered as legit and will be subject to corruption. Bitcoin is about decentralization and that's the way it's got to be for it to work.
Bitcoin is doing just fine  and won't change if it doesn't have to. Maybe after the next halving if the block rewards can't cover electricity expense... As for the social media trolls, there is little that can be done, but isn't that what social medias are all about?

I think we agree.  
1) Any change needs the miners approval as long as we're certain their choice isn't being dictated by some central authority (Chinese or any other)  
2) UASF is probably not a great idea; as I understand it changes the voting mechanism by handing the power from the miners to the exchanges. Don't think it will happen either.  
3) well... for sure then!

Do what ever you wish, you're free to choose.  
- Fork the project and make something better if you are a dev.

- Diversify you investments in other cryptos if you want to play it safe.  
- Do nothing if you please.

1) "Stop threatening to split the chain" would be a nice compromise to start with.  
2) "Only hard-fork when needed with 95% support" would be another step in the right direction.  
3) "If no agreement is possible, then the status quo is ok" would wrap it up.

How will it reduce fees when miners pick the blocksize and collect those fees?  
Do you sincerely believe they'll mine big enough blocks to keep to the mempool empty to charge low fees?  
If BU ever happens my guess is they'll pick a blocksize that maximizes their profits which is the only logical decision and which means a smaller blocksize if anything.  
If miners are opposed to Segwit it's because it is equivalent to a blocksize increase and will reduces fees which is opposed to miner's interests. By supporting BU all they're saying is they prefer the status quo: Full blocks and high fees suit their business perfectly!

Segwit is done, only the hardfork isn't done yet.  
Most miners don't want Segwit and those who want to fork are free to do so whenever they want. Miners are part of "we", that's the way it works.  
The only point is that if you fork you are creating a new project based on the code of the previous one, it does not entitle you to take over the original project's name. And the project's name is simply "bitcoin", not "core" or anything else  ( The project has 7601 forks and none of them can take over the original's name.  
So if BU forks with BTU's I wish them good look. I just hope BU and the exchanges will act honestly and make sure people don't loose their money in the confusion (with replay-attacks, etc...).

Wrong: Mining power is only one component of the ecosystem, the others are users, wallets and innovative projects such as LN that will make bitcoin available for mass adoption.  
As soon as BU forks, segwit will immediately be adopted and become the better chain for the future. Then if ever a block increase is needed, it won't be a problem to hard fork it.  
If BU forks and captures the value of the coins that's great too as we'll be able to buy cheap core coins for when LN takes over the world and BU fades away by lack of a competent development team and over centralized mining controlled by the PBOC.  
Just pack your FUD back to and tell everyone it's time for BU to fork: We all want it, whether BU fans or Segwit fans.

Big blocks or BU are like adding nitro to you car engine and that's cool until the engine burns out, but what bitcoin needs is a multi-layer rocket to get to the moon and segwit is the engine that will boost it.

So far from the reality you pretend to wish to discuss as everyone knows it's not going to happen. You're only spreading FUD and if you had any sensible knowledge you'd know better. BU has been debunked over and over again with plenty of valid arguments and nothing to show for itself, so what do you think there is left to discuss here?
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:20:59
The only logical explanation that comes to my mind as well...
@_date: 2017-01-29 09:47:43
Bitcoin is working great at 350.000 txs/day which allows 1 tx/day for 0,00005% of the global population leaving a free scene for competition as such performance hardly allows it to qualify as digital cash.  
If an industrial manufacturer needs gold for his production or an Indian groom for his bride, it'll take more than 10 minutes to acquire and no bitcoin transaction will help if that gold isn't available.  
Bitcoin was intended to be usable as cash by everybody but fails and will continue to fail whether or not the blocksize increases.  
2nd layers like lightning networks are the only way out; the blocksize debate is irrelevant.

Sorry but wrong.  
Mining difficulty adjusts automatically to the hash power to keep the target of 1 block / 10 mins. More power means you use more electricity and you get more 0's in the block hash, making it more secure. In 2013 when the price reached all time highs, my guess is that the hash power was way inferior.  
However, miners must pay their bills with the 12.5btc block reward + ~1btc/block fees. If the price dumps they risk going out of business, but since they hold large chunks of coins, it's quite easy for them to control market prices. The cool part is that Bitmain, who build the Antminer also run Antpool so if other miners don't but their machines, they use them and push everyone else out of business. A clear conflict of interest of a private company setting up a market monopoly in my opinion, but as long as we keep buying and hodling the show will go on.  
Full blocks and high fees might help but no matter what size blocks we use, they'll fill up rapidly to pump up the fees spreading the illusion of wider adoption. When the reward diminishes and they'll have to survive on fees alone, it might mean the game is over.

If you have to be a specialist to run a clustered full node with dedicated hardware, then not anyone can join the network even if they are free to do so at their own expense.  
Banks are planning to remove cash and replace it with some kind of digital currency that will work just fine for the average citizen who wants to pay for his coffee. Of course KYC/AML laws will apply just as they do for BTC businesses and that's just fine for 99% of us who consider themselves honest people. 
Today if 10% of the population of Los Angeles were to buy one coffee a day, the BTC network would be saturated.  
Also competition is fine, it drives innovation so why refuse it with this 95% threshold that isn't part of Satoshi's vision?

I agree, but I also see that the same applies to bitcoin with the difference that BTC devs care about immutability whereas ETH devs and their investors don't. I'll add that any ETH dev also qualifies as an ETC dev so they can choose which chain offers them the most incentive to work on.  
Maybe next time a load of BTC gets hacked on a central trading platform, BTC investors will offer enough incentive to devs to fork and roll back as well...

I believe Andreas Antanopulos educated the Deutsche Bank on bitcoin. Maybe he did it only after this Davos meeting...  
However it goes to show that since  AD 2008 (or *AB 0: year 0 After Bitcoin*) and the financial breakdown, these people haven't learned anything. If you can't adapt, zap!  
The world would be a great place to live if we didn't need bitcoin. But for the meanwhile we'll have to squeeze our needs and our dreams into 300K Txs/day while waiting for Roger V. to adopt segwit. (&lt;= Roger I'm begging you!)
@_date: 2017-01-28 20:01:30
Great, since no one has called you a troll yet, I'll share my satoshi worth of thoughts here and see how it turns out.  
 
* The ETH/ETC hard fork comparison doesn't stand because it wasn't related to scaling but to immutability. Rolling back transactions and blocking accounts is one thing, increasing Tx throughput, fixing malleability, etc...  is another. If you weren't a DAO holder then both ethers offer identical features except for the hashing rate and price. Strange that the immutable ETC is worth less, but then Ether is fairly useless no mater which one you pick.
* BU fans wish to fork, and they certainly don't need 95% mining support to do so. Anyone can fork BTC and create a new BTC-alt/shit coin if they please. Miners decide what version they run, users decide which one they use. In my case I don't care who is responsible for the fork, I'll turn to the most efficient one (throughput, fees, security, widespread adoption, etc...)
* My understanding is that if segwit is a softfork and is activated, then all I need to do is to use a compatible wallet to benefit from it's improvements. It seems strange in a free market that the miner lobby gets to make the calls, when it should be the users that are paying them. I would prefer my fees to be collected by a segwit miner who actually cares about scaling BTC rather than one who isn't bothered about updating his system.
* Billions of people around the world will benefit from a truly usable crypto, not just for paying coffees, and the sooner the better.   No blocksize increase can accommodate such a demand unless it's run on a  handful of super-computers, but then the bankers will offer that and they won't need a blockchain to do so. The only way out is lightning networks until some genius comes up with a better idea.  
So my opinion is to roll out the wallets and the lightning networks, activate segwit and let the users decide what they want to use.  
PS: I clearly understand that the price will plunge at first and that it will piss off a lot of speculators and whales. But what the hell as long as BTC can serve everybody's needs some day.

Might be cutting-edge for the techies, it's just some form of digital cash for the rest of us with a limit to 350K tx/day meaning 10% of the Los Angeles population can use it to buy 1 coffee a day. Such limited usability really sucks and cutting-edge is not the word I'd pick to describe it.  
Who profits from this status quo between Core/segwit who won't budge with less than 95% mining power, RogerVer/ViaBTC with BU who want to fork but wont and the mining pools that won't upgrade to either solution?  
Nobody is rushing so I guess there is no rush except for the users who'd like to be able to spend bitcoin on a daily basis whether it be for a coffee or a pair of socks rather than being limited to trading it on central platforms like if it where some casino token.  
If Litecoin deploys segwit and lightning networks first, and bitcoin stays stuck in this mess, we (the users) can easily switch. Don't rush, other options will prevail. After all it's a free market.

The status quo is benefiting those who have a vote: Blockstream, Bitmain and other whales.

Jihan wants to profit from Asicboost and collect as much on fees as possible. Blocksize has nothing to do with fees, once the blocks are full of spam, real users will be paying as much for their Txs. On the other hand, Segwit breaks Asicboost and that's no good to him.

August 1st Bitcoin is upgrading to the only valid upgrade available out there.  
Miners were kindly asked to signal as soon as they were ready for the upgrade but instead decided that they would use the signaling mechanism as a voting one to veto the upgrade.  
Now the community is telling them time is up and  if they don't follow, they will be mining a worthless chain that nobody will accept, but if they wish to split off, it's their choice and it can't be stopped.  
Miners don't get to vote, they get to signal their readiness only or else they're fired!

The market price will decide and miners will follow the money.  
MASF now or UASF on August 1st makes little difference, Bitcoin is getting Segwit one way or the other. Next the legacy chain will be reorg'd as soon as the new chain grows longer making it worthless.  
The only way out for Jihan is to hardfork with BU and bigger blocks, but we know that won't work because of bug'd software and total lack of support.  
Just hold on until UASF, it will work out fine.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:36:02
My understanding is Aug-1st at 0h, 148 nodes wait for the first 148 block to be mined to lock-in, from that moment it takes another 2 weeks for 148 to activate.  
Bitmain's fork is to happen  Would it not be wiser and look a lot better for the 148 miners to make the version switch after the fork happens?

Segwit2x is just a marketing scam with no code to run: not written, not tested. On the other hand UASF segwit is going live August 1st.  
The choice is dirt simple: Stay on the old chain that will be overwritten by the new one and loose all value, or embrace the future of world wide crypto-currency and financial innovation for everybody.  
My only concern with UASF148 is: Can it rid us of all this ignorant trolling on Reddit?
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:22:48
They most likely modify the Core code to decide which transactions will be included in a block but nothing more: They mine there own spam transactions that are filling up the mempool and increasing fees and make sure no one else collects them. For the rest it's essentially Core code doing the work.

If your bitcoin is on an exchange, ask them if they will support the split. If in doubt, withdraw your btc to a wallet on which you control the private keys. Don't wait to long as exchanges will probably be DDoSed / overloaded and withdrawals impossible come August 1st.  
If you don't clearly understand how to split your coins, don't make any transactions beginning August and wait for things to clear up. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:22:37
Stay off the legacy chain and upgrade to segwit. Dump the legacy coins and buy more segwit coins.  The legacy coin will be worthless so even if txs get wiped out, technically the money is already lost or on the segwit chain.  
All will be ok. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:07:33

@_date: 2017-06-05 21:44:27
Bitcoin is an open-source project. That's why no one can control it and why anyone can fork it.  
It the market thinks the segwit upgrade is better than the legacy version, then that's were the money will go.  UASF gives investors an opportunity to decide now that the miners have us logically stuck with status quo, simply because their job is to mine the blocks the market values most and not to decide what chain it should be.  
Supporting BIP148 is giving people the freedom of choice which is what free markets are all about.  
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:46:21
The legacy chain will be exposed to a reorg, therefor it can not be trusted, therefor it has no value.  
The BIP148 coin will have segwit, developer and user support. It will pack more txs in a block than the legacy chain and will carry all future innovations, therefor it'll be worth more.  
To me it seems quite simple, but yes, I'm wishful thinking when I say the markets will follow the same logic. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:15:20
All companies that deal in BTC should make sure they're 148 ready or they risk losing payments when the legacy chain gets merged back into the 148.

Seems like a stalemate for the miners. If they don't support 148, they must keep the legacy chain longer and big blockers will be pissed.
