This is what happens when everyone starts talking about DDoSes being done on Mt.Gox: someone gets the bright idea to do it.

Thanks for the replies. They help. It's just frustrating to watch people like throwing more money than I've ever seen in my life around just to troll. At the same time, it's heartening to see people like me that did invest and will now lead a comfortable life becuause of it. 
I'll ease up on myself a bit, you guys are right. I couldn't possibly have known.

I don't mean to come off like that guy, but posts like this make me wish I had followed through when I first heard about bitcoins when they were worth nothing. I'm stuck in another city hunting for jobs with $400 dollars to my name, and I can't imagine what a windfall like that would be like. (I'm 28, for the record). Anyway, I'm happy for you OP. You deserve it.

I'm actually here debating if I should buy in now or wait for the floor to fall through and pick up BTC at dirt cheap.

If I had any money to invest, I would, but I barely have enough to eat properly.

Congratulations. I'm so happy to see stories like this, even if I didn't gain anything from this bitcoin boom. I definitely empathize with the shitty liberal arts degree part.
Trying to get a masters to fix that, but first I actually have to go back to undergrad level to improve my GPA enough to be able to go to graduate school. 
That's neither here nor there. Enjoy your new debt free life! :)

That's more money than I've ever had in my bank account, ever.
