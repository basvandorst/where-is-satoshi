This is what a 14 year old would tell himself to try and not take any responsibility for his bigotry.  Congrats on being a middle school version of a bigot.

Lmao, you're so desperate to convince me that your bigotry is totally justified.  I like how when you ran out of real things to say to justify your blind hatred you pretended you only wanted to stick to Bitcoin-related discussions.  Yeah, you totally didn't start this conversation or anything, you've always been just about the Bitcoin.  Take this 100% Bitcoin-only-related quote for example:


You're wasting your time trying to convince normal people that bigotry is super cool, save it for impressionable socially-isolated high school kids on the internet that are so desperate for any form of validation that they'll join your internet hate cult just to feel like they're part of something.  Those are the only people left that care about anything you have to say, and you have only yourself to blame for choosing the comfort of self-serving ignorance.

Nice 4chan kiddie excuse that you cut and pasted from a hate cult to excuse your participation in the normalization of bigotry.  You're a walking stereotype of someone that did no critical thinking to arrive at their selfish and childish worldview.
Enjoy a lifetime of blaming imaginary people for your isolation.
