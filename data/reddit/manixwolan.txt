Nah, my honeymoon period ended when I lost thousands to gox. I think I just truly believe in it on a fundamental level.

That is an understandable opinion, however if you knew the frequency of my use I believe you would think differently. I only use substances once every two or so months, and I believe that alcohol is the most dangerous substance that I have so far tried. 
The exception to this is mushrooms which I did weekly for about 6 months when I was 15 during my honeymoon phase. (it helped that I lived In Bali where they were legal) I have learned from that period of abuse, however, and I don't believe I will ever frequently (ie more often then every 2 months) use any substance again.
Edit: I appreciate your concern however, and thank you for giving me the incentive to reevaluate the consequences of my drug use. That is how one prevents problems from arising.

Well, I haven't been using drugs since I was 13, I first started when I was 15. I see how it seems strange that I am so knowledgeable about these substances, but I am hoping to major in pharmacology. I have a genuine interest in the human brain and how it functions especially in relation to drugs. So yes, most of the things that I recommend are not known out of personal experience but rather through research. :) 
Edit: also the timed lock box is not the only method used to control use. Self control is the primary, this lock box is simply a secondary.
Also, I hope I don't sound too much like a boasting teenager. I genuinely believe in harm reduction as the best approach to drugs, and I simply hope to share harm reduction info to the best of my ability.

No no, I'm not interested in dealing drugs. Way too risky if you ask me. I've been investing in stocks and commodities since I was quite young. That is how I made the money I used to purchase Bitcoin. Feel free to google me for confirmation, I had an article written partially about me and my investment career.

Well, he lost all his coins to gox and has been done with it ever since. He still believes in Bitcoin strongly, but doesn't hold any because he thinks it's too risky. I'm a hodler though!

I am 17 now, my father first introduced me to it  when I went with him to the Bitcoin 2013 conference in silicon valley.
Edit: da shpelling

Damn post history, always getting me in trouble ;) But in all seriousness I'm a fairly irregular drug user so I don't believe it will cause me any major problems.
