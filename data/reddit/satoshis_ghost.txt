Yeah, let me know how you're going to have background checks in a decentralized manner. The whole appeal of Uber and Lyft is that the drivers are vetted by ratings and through background checks. Somebody got raped by an Uber driver in Boston. Imagine what would happen if anybody could drive an Uber car. I'm sure taxi drivers have done the same before, but no rational person is going to get in the car with a random person. 
Edit: Jesus Christ, people, learn to read. I said Uber and taxi drivers have raped people before, too. I just don't see how a decentralized app couldn't possibly make that a larger problem with today's technology.

It's impossible for Bitcoin to be stable at a $3 billion market cap. That's a drop in the ocean. The volatility exists because we have a currency that's worth a fraction of what a text messaging app just sold for a few months ago. To put it another way, Bitcoin's market cap is roughly equal to what Microsoft bought Minecraft for. How could a currency ever be useful with a market cap that low?

No, this wasn't just a one-line bug. It's a sign of a much larger problem. Their "testing" is manually running parts of their website as outlined in an RTF file. There's no regression testing, unit testing, or any sort of quality control. They completely rewrote a critical crypto function, and from what I can tell, they did no testing, code review, or anything.  For a company with as much funding as they have, it's completely unacceptable. No financial services company should be this incompetent, and noobs should know not to use them. With the amount of witch-hunting this sub does on Coinbase and Circle, it's absurd to not do the same to Blockchain.

You had to append the "on Desktop" bit, didn't you? People ended up being right about Linux being huge, only it took over on mobile and on servers, rather than replacing Windows as a desktop OS for most users. Perhaps Bitcoin will be similar.

I stand corrected. I thought the Counterparty/Mastercoin filter was new. I still don't agree with the blacklisting, though, and I doubt I'll be the last person to make this mistake. When I said "employee," I meant that you get a paycheck, although I do think it's a great idea to be an independent contractor so if things go south, you and the other devs can leave if need be. 
I think sidechains are the most important development in Bitcoin since multisig, so I truly hope Blockstream is successful, and I'm 99.9% sure you guys mean well. That being said, any possible conflicts of interest will be scrutinized by the community (and the trolls), for better or for worse, because you're proposing relatively substantial protocol changes and money is involved.

You don't know anything about software development. It's not that easy. 20 years later, and we're still using IPv4. Bitcoin doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be the first working solution with a sizable user base. All the big players would have to move in unison to another platform. As the ecosystem grows, more and more companies develop software dependent on bitcoin. More importantly, more and more open source libraries have to be made for your competing platform. This is the last thing I'm worried about with bitcoin. I'm far more concerned about the government fucking it up for mainstream adoption than some shitcoin taking over, and even that is more of a short term problem in a global economy.

Give our wonderful regulators an early Christmas present with reports of the most blatant Ponzi in recent memory. By the way, this is what a Ponzi scheme is, by definition.

Case in point: luke-jr introduced filters for "spam" that included Mastercoin and Counterparty transactions ~~a few weeks ago~~ for the Gentoo binary for bitcoind. To be fair, not many people still use Gentoo, and fewer still would use that binary rather than compile it from source, but still, he's an employee of Blockstream, and he filtered competing transactions from his version of bitcoind. I overwhelmingly support what Blockstream claims to be doing, but it's important to be vigilant when you introduce a more centralized development process. will take it to an extreme, of course, but concern is warranted.

Just to clarify: P2SH is not multisig. Multisig almost always uses P2SH, but you can easily make a pubkey script that's then hashed to form a 1-of-1 P2SH address. You can also make a multisig transaction without P2SH, although it's rather uncommon. P2SH refers to what's being hashed to make an address. Addresses take the form of [1B Version Byte][20 B hash][4B checksum], which are then base-58 encoded. With old P2PKH-style addresses, you had a hash of a pubkey. Now, you can hash the redeem script instead. The version byte is what makes P2SH addresses start with a 3 and P2PKH addresses start with a 1. In testnet, it also changes the leading character to an 'm', an 'n', or a '2'. Multisig just refers to how many signatures need to be included to validate a transaction. They're related concepts, but they're not the same.

They don't make money on trading fees because their bots can pump and dump the price to make them money on "futures" contracts.

To play Devil's advocate, the futures markets are based out of China and there's evidence that suggests they're bucket shops disguised as futures markets. If that were the case, it wouldn't even be illegal in China. Don't trust Huobi and OKCoin. They're the next Gox waiting to happen...
That being said, there are more  legitimate ways to buy BTC than ever. Coinbase, Circle, Trucoin, Celery, Buttercoin, Bitstamp, etc. As always, if something seems sketchy, it probably is. Offering 20x or 50x leverage for a market as small as Bitcoin is a recipe for disaster.

To be fair, Gox was the longest-running BTC exchange at the time, and some people probably ignored the warning signs and thought they couldn't possibly have been that incompetent if they hadn't turned into another Bitcoinica by late 2013-early 2014. GAW doesn't have that track record. In fact, it appears this isn't Garza's first con.

During the Silk Road trial, we learned that DHS gave Karpeles immunity in exchange for helping with the Silk Road investigation, despite the fact that another DHS agent was investigating Karpeles and Ashley Barr for operating the Silk Road. I'm not convinced DPR is Karpeles at all, but I'm also not convinced Ulbrict is, either. Ulbrict was sloppy. DPR managed to evade international law enforcement for several years. Why would someone as elusive as DPR still be living in SF? Why would they have a BitTorrent client on their PC? Why would *anyone* keep a journal of their criminal activities unencrypted on their PC? 
The Japanese police also came out and said that they suspect MtGox was an inside job, but apparently that prick still gets all the frappucchinos his tiny heart desires because DHS gave him immunity. That shouldn't matter in Japanese jurisdiction, but somehow I have a feeling the Japanese will do anything the world's police tells them to, especially considering the China situation over that stupid island.

I don't know why I'm feeding a racist troll, but here's a list of a few of the many factors of this phenomenon:
1. Minorities are poorer than whites and Asians. Therefore, they're less likely to have Computer Science courses at their schools, broadband internet, or even a computer at home, for that matter. If you go to university (and that's a big if) from an environment like that, good luck catching up to your peers.
2. There are a lot of neckbeards at CS programs that shit on women for being less capable and getting a pussy pass. You can see this on this very website if you don't believe me. Many of the women who try CS say "fuck it" and go into a field without sexist assholes.
3. Women from a young age are discouraged from math and science because of cultural reasons.
4. The long, erratic hours common in IT are incompatible with being the primary caregiver to your children.
By the way, the reason there are more black people in the NBA than white people is the same reason why there are more white people than Asian people. There are differences in height and stature among racial groups. There isn't a difference in intelligence. Nice strawman, though.

The only incompetence I see with this move is that they weren't using AWS before. They handle so much for you, it isn't even funny. Calling it outsourcing when it's superior in nearly every way I can think of is unfair, if you ask me. Security is hard. Why make it harder by running your own servers? If AWS wasn't solid, half the Internet would be in some serious shit. They handle databases for you. They handle securing the physical servers themselves. They handle deployment of new servers. They handle logging and permissions. They handle backups. They handle networking, creating a virtual VPN (Amazon VPC), permissions, and firewalls.  To make it even better, AWS is cheaper than running your own servers, too. They did redeploy their servers, and it was on a new virtual server. Calling it new hardware isn't entirely accurate, but it's a decent layman's explanation. The technical users know what AWS is. I don't see the issue here.  If AWS is good enough for the CIA, it's good enough for Bitstamp, IMO.

There's a very slim chance that they'll recover the funds, but the government isn't going to ignore a $5 million hack entirely just because it's "magic internet money." Also, Bitstamp is registered in Slovenia, but most of their operations are based out of the UK, and they're indeed regulated. It's not BTC-e.

International remittances, international B2B payments, and paying foreign workers are the use cases that blow the traditional payments system out of the water. International banking is horribly inefficient. We're in a global economy, and these middlemen still make huge fees on these transactions. Also, smart contracts will make escrow far cheaper than it is today. Credit card fraud costs the global economy trillions each year. These problems are not individual problems. Personally, I think the push for merchant and consumer acceptance has been largely misguided. Consumers don't give a shit about finance. They just want something that works. That takes time, though. The financial industry moves very slowly.
The overhead on buying and selling BTC is about 1% on each end of the transaction. I'm not going to address volatility because it's avoidable if you buy and sell instantly, and it'll be a solved problem if this market ever becomes more liquid. Volatility is not a flaw inherent to the protocol. It's a flaw inherent to largely speculative assets with tiny valuations.

No, it's not. The miners' subsidy is demurrage, not a transaction fee. It's like saying that each USD transaction has a hidden cost from inflation, which isn't true. Inflation is a cost associated with holding a currency, not with spending it. Also, that basic calculation is not taking into account the varying cost of a Bitcoin over time. Satoshi's coins should not be counted in such a calculation, and the coins mined today have a lower cost to the network than in December 2013.

Alternatively, their assets are less volatile, so their financial situation is more stable. It makes sense to me. You're already running a risk by operating a Bitcoin exchange.

You missed my point. If you're in Russia, Argentina, Venezuela, or China and want to get assets denominated in USD, you could build miners with your fiat, and sell the newly-minted bitcoins for USD on an exchange.

Also, I really doubt the Slovenian police are capable of investigating an ordinary cybercrime properly, never mind something as niche and technical as BTC.

This is unrelated to the comment you replied to, but since you're here on this thread, I figured I should ask this anyway. I agree that the NSA probably has access to Bitstamp's data since they're on AWS, but I'm not seeing how this is any different than it was before. Bitstamp is based in the EU, and they follow AML/KYC laws. If a Five Eyes organization wanted access before, they could get it. I suppose they could subpoena AWS, gag them, and get their data without Bitstamp's knowledge now, but I have a hard time believing that Bitstamp would have an easier time fighting such an order when they were independent than Amazon's army of lawyers. I develop software using AWS for a living. I've read their security documentation extensively, and I don't see how a small company could possibly host data more securely than AWS can. Am I missing something? I'm personally shocked that Bitstamp *wasn't* on AWS before. I wouldn't be surprised if the hack was something as simple as a rogue employee copying data from their physical servers onto a USB drive and running off to  an extradition-free Central American country with $5 million in their pockets.

I don't intend to buy any because I don't see why you couldn't implement Namecoin with a sidechain or Counterparty, but it's an interesting proof of concept. DNS is a centralized point of failure with the Internet. It'll be truly interesting if SSL/TLS could be decentralized as well using a blockchain. These are some of the easiest points of attack for the NSA and the Five Eyes, and if they could be decentralized, it would make their jobs a lot more difficult, which is a win for freedom and for the US tech industry. As a developer, it terrifies me how many jobs will be lost because foreign countries no longer want our products. Cisco and several other tech companies have already reported huge reductions in foreign contracts since the Snowden leaks.  I'm learning German this summer as a plan B, because I really don't know how much longer we'll be the world's center of technology thanks to these fascists.
