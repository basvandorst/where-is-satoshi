Can't we all just agree what the next ATH is so that we can follow through with this plan? I mean wouldn't that feel dumb selling before the peak.

Are you avoiding those exchanges or just avoiding the silly fees they charge to automate?  I wrote up a script for the non-coders to automate their purchase using the pro.coinbase.  They just jacked their rates, but it would still be flat 0.5%.

I believe much opportunity in investment. Binary income streams bring much success.

Is that you, time traveler?

Also this is automatic. I'm trying to avoid fees and be lazy.

You guys just eating the high fees on those regular buys, or have I not found the right app?

Sorry, should have been more clear. I thought you were automatically making regular purchases. To my knowledge, cb pro won't do auto scheduling. I'm looking to automate regular purchases at that .25% level. Right now it seems like you can either do low fees or auto transactions, not both.
