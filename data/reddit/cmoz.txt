The question I have is how the 2mb HF on Luke Jr's "Post-segwit 2 MB block size hardfork" would be implemented exactly. It seems to actually REDUCE the max potential blocksize by limiting segwit transactions as well?
To better match the intention of people calling for a 2mb HF after segwit, you could make block weight 8000000, which would increase the effective throughput of segwit by 2.1mb to 4.2mb or so, or alternatively be enough block weight for 2-2.5mb of non segwit transactions. Youd probably end up with a mix of segwit and nonsegwit and get something like 3mb. You might argue that that'd cause potential 8mb spam blocks, but why not just enforce a 4mb blocksize limit to prevent that?

Where did Satoshi say proof-of-work would remain widely distributed, or define "widely distributed" for that matter? Or are you just blowing hot air?
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:42:26
Why do you think they'd want a hardfork in addition to segwit that doesn't actually increase transaction capacity beyond segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:43:57
Sure you're free to fork off if you want, but the 84% of miners and  companies representing $5 billion monthly transaction volume are free to form an agreement amongst themselves in the same way. You hint at coercion on their side yet dismiss it on UASF side and I can't see how that'd logical.


You're confusing compromise with coersion. Compromise necessarily involves accepting something you might not really want, or less of what you want, in order to get some of what you want. I can just as easily say that some 2mb hardfork blockers were using coersion to force offchain solutions. Some believe a direct capacity increase is beneficial, but want to block it in order to incentivise offchain solutions. 
Really I don't see how whining about coersion is helpful at all. Both sides are free to do as they want, and no one is holding a gun to anyone's head, and no one has a right to force anyone to use their chain. It's a useless discussion.

Are you sure? That sounds ok to me, but from reading Luke's proposal sounded like he was saying to apply the blockweight 4000000 to legacy transactions as well. If you had all standard legacy transactions, 1 input and 2 outputs, would the blocksize end up as 2mb, or would the 4000000 blockweight prevent it from reaching that since only 30% would be sig data that gets the 1 weight unit discount and 70% would be getting the 4 weight unit multiplier?

You made the claim, prove it. The fact is that while working on a malleability fix, they realized they could increase the blocksize as a soft fork with it, and then presented it as a solution to the scaling debate. It was their first and only proposal, despite Eric's claims the miners reject "anything we deliver"...you only delivered ONE thing. So the statement is misleading.

Hardfork requires users to update their nodes or they get forked off. So it makes sense to have users upgrade to one node that supports all terms of the agreement lea ding up to the hardfork. If you don't agree with it, no one is forcing you to run the code Garzik is writing.

@_date: 2017-05-28 19:47:41
If you think miners are actually rejecting segwit because of asicboost (which their former competitor Knc miner seems to think is unlikely-  asicboost would be much less profitable than the numbers thrown around on this forum because of difficulties in actually implementing it effectively) doesn't it make sense then to call their "bluff" of supporting segwit + 2mb non-witness HF? The agreement includes segwit, which would break covert asic boost. Why go full retard with a destructive UASF when segwit + 2mb nonwitness is an option with broad industry support, and arguably even more user support than UASF as well?

@_date: 2017-05-30 17:51:15
That's a bit presumtive. I think what they want is a version of segwit that requires hardfork support to activate. If they make their version compatible with covert asicboost it will be very obvious, but there's no sign of that yet.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:43:45
If it was "guaranteed" to fail why would anyone transact with it at all?  How would they transact with no miners? That would imply some chance of success if people are using it. It looks like you're under the delusion that theres some kind of free ride here.
The amount of money you're willing to lose is tied proportionally to the chance of success of the UASF. Sure, there can be freeloaders who can trade with UASF coins with no risk, but they're also contributing nothing to the success of the fork, and just freeloading off the UASF users who actually have something at risk. And by definition if they are trading their UASF coins without putting any value into the system through exchanges/cash trades, then they are driving the value of UASF coins DOWN.

Segwit was supposed to be 2.1mb, I've even seen 2.7mb thrown around justified by the idea that the witness discount will encourage more multisig, ect.
If all the transactions were standard transactions, and not segwit transactions, about how big could the block be? Would the blockweight prevent it from reaching 2mb or no? It seems like if you apply the blockweight to regular 1 input 2 output transactions you end up with a blocksize of less than 2mb? Maybe not but I'm a bit confused how that would work.

@_date: 2017-05-30 17:58:32
Maybe because they want an implementation of segwit that relies on signaling segwit and the hardfork at the same time. They want 80% signaling for their specific proposal that locks in in both. If they used the old BIP they could be pushed over the 80% figure by people who have not signaled any intention to hardfork, which is not what they want.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:56:13


I think the broad interpretation of proof-of-stake in bitcoin, like you mention here, is the more correct one. Just *having* coins in bitcoin doesnt really give you a vote. Making an active decision, or credible threat, to buy or sell coins based on the actions of the miners is what gives you a vote. 
In this way I think proof-of-stake is still validating proof-of-work correctly in bitcoin. The largest stakeholders like Bitpay and Coinbase (who have the ability to choose for their users which chain they will support...and they have millions of users) continue to have the most power. No miner is going to choose to mine a chain that has an imminent threat of being abandoned by the major exchanges and payment processors. We can see over the past 2 years that miners are reluctant to change anything unless they have a guarantee from the major economic players, that they will follow their updated chain. The Barry Silbert agreement seeks to address this. UASF is attempting to leverage their stake to get their way also, but I think diehard UASF supports are massively overestimating their stake in the system relative to the silent majority and the large economic players.

I presume that Garzik's implementation might make it harder for people to support it just long enough to get segwit and then back out before the hardfork. There were people who were just going to signal UASF since it was compatible with that, but not signal the HF part. Garzik's proposal will likely make it to where you have to signal the HF and the segwit at the same time for it to work.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:25:19
Why is that preferable to linking the two so that we know everyone is on the same page? 
And if a small minority of extremists want to fork themselves off the network with a UASF even when we have a good compromise being actively coded in an open environment by an experienced Core dev like Garzik, good riddance.

What do you mean it doesn't exist? I just linked to it.
Also, the fork battle will be fought with users dumping coins on one fork and buying coins on the other. The only way one side isn't going to lose in that scenario is if you don't plan on actually backing up your threats with economic action, in which case UASF would just be a bluff.

Satoshi had virtually unamimous support from users and miners for changes he made.

@_date: 2017-05-24 07:27:08
They could have the hardfork and segwit lock-in at the same time. Segwit could then activate immmediately upon locking in, and the HF could have a 6 month delay before it activates. Theres a difference between lock-in and activation here.

All the 'speaking' in the world wouldn't prevent wladamir from doing what he set out to do, if he was dead set on doing it. If he was compromised he could just downplay concerns and pretend that users are on board with the idea, because there's no real way to prove they're not until a fork actually happens and the forks compete on the exchanges. The Microsoft employees can speak their mind too, but that doesn't mean that one person isn't making the final decision. Whether wladamir listens to those concerns is totally up to him. Do you get it?
No one has proven that 4mb blocks jeordizes bitcoin's decentralization. If you think that true, show some evidence. Otherwise you're preventing progress for no good reason. It's possible that bigger blocks up to a point could INCREASE decentralization because the userbase would be likely to expand and new people decide to run nodes faster than people with shit internet decide to stop running a full node.

The only thing unique about bitcoin vs altcoins is the network effect and first mover advantage. The companies involved in this agreement have a huge role in maximizing that network effect. We should play to bitcoin's strengths and allow the blocksize to grow and accomodate more users. If you think bitcoin is useless unless you can cheaply run a full node in Zimbabwe, you can go use an altcoin with a lower userbase. Dont try to cripple Bitcoin's userbase for some poorly defined ideal you have. I'm pretty sure that "near unanimous consensus" really just means whatever you want it to mean at the time and is convenient for you, because its not defined.

They claim wladamir has no power, because if he doesnt follow 'consensus' then all the other devs will instantly leave and start a competing repository. With that logic, you could say the president of the United States has no power either, because we can just impeach him whenever we want. And Facebook's CEO has no power, because all their devs could just leave and go start a new facebook. Reality is obviously little more complicated. Wladamir has final say on what makes it into the code. Sure, theoretically you could stage a revolt and make a competing repository, but the control of the repository still gives him alot of practical power.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:08:10


Thus continues to be a red herring. Of course segwit allows for larger blocks. But we want an increase beyond what segwit offers.
I think a good compromise would be 6000000 block weight, which would allow for 2mb of standard transactions, or about 3.1mb of segwit transactions in noral use. And then you could limit the blocksize to 4mb to prevent signature heavy spam.

Doesnt it seem less destructive to have a sybil-proof vote BEFORE you cause a chainsplit? Bitcoin has given us the technology to do that, it seems stupid to not use it.
The anti-core/blockstream votes are winning by over 70,000 coins on some issues. If you think the vote being on bitcoin.com is an issue, it seems like it'd be wise to create a counterpoint for it on bitcoin.org or something. The silence is defening, but exactly what I'd expect if the blockstream/UASF side doesn't believe that they actually have an economic majority, but is actually just a bluff. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:29:32
How can wladamir be removed? He can't be removed, he has control of the repository. The only way he can be removed from the current repo is if he voluntarily passes the torch to someone else, as Gavin did. Otherwise everyone would have to coordinate to leave the current repo and join a new repo. If you think the ability to leave a centralized organization and start a competitor means the original organization isn't actually centralized...you must not be thinking very clearly here. If Wladimir AND theymos/whoever controls bitcoin.org were both compromized, it would be very difficult to get users to reject the compromized implementation. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:42:25
You can still mine without cheap electricity, it just makes it more expensive. It's not china's fault if you can't compete effectively in the market, as the system was designed. The point is that you don't need permission to play the game, like in the banking system, not that you're going to be the biggest best miner in the game.
And again, I'm not contesting that a UASF with an overwhelming majority of wallets, businesses, and exchanges could work fine. I'm saying I don't think UASF has a majority at all, let alone an overwhelming one. And doing it with a minority of miner AND minority of the bitcoin economy is just stupid economically. It seems like the people most fervent about UASF at all costs, are the ones who don't actually own much bitcoin, so the risk is low for them. But if your UASF is supported by people with few bitcoins compared to those who don't go along with UASF, it's going to fail dramatically.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:54:56
They agreed to it if it comes with a 2mb nonwitness data HF. That's a compromise I can accept too. Now we just need an activation mechanism that locks both in at the same time, with segwit activating immediately, and the hardfork being delayed by a few months after its locked in.

No I won't, because segwit without a blocksize increase was never presented as a solution to the scaling debate. While they were working on a fix to malleability, they realized they could increase the blocksize with segwit, and then presented it as THE SOLUTION to the scaling debate. It was their one and only proposal. Where are all these other options that Eric claims he delivered to the miners but they weren't satisfied?

By "it" you mean UASF chain or the miner majority chain?
The problem is that you seem to assume that UASF has a clear economic majority, which seems delusional to me. UASF is guaranteed chainsplit without an OVERWHELMING economic majority, and it's pretty clear it doesn't have it, despite about 90 fervent UASF supporting reddit accounts (how many people are behind those accounts I don't know, but likely less than 90).

Thats the thing though, you claim that UASF is risk free, but it will also have value. You can't claim both. To have value you're going to have to take the risk of actually losing money trying to pump the price up if it fails.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:56:41


This assumes there will be any significant economic activity with UASF besides on an exchange. Very few businesses support bitcoin itself, how many are going to support UASF coins? And you're GOING TO HAVE TO BUY UASF COINS with US dollars on an exchange for them to have any real value in order for these theoretical businesses to be able to value it, or else non-UASF users are going to dump your coin to 0, and no businesses will be able to accept it except out of charity. You're going to have to risk real money on exchanges. If UASF fails you will lose real money, unless there was never any support at all, and it was all a bluff with no one willing to put money on it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:01:40
The polls that can't be sybil attacked show that UASF/Blockstream/small blockers do not have an economic majority. Mining and coin votes are against you.

You're still assuming they're actually running asicboost just because they had software related to it on their miner firmware. Is there any proof it was implemented in hardware?
The actual Segwit code doesn't really need to change at all. Only a new activation method is needed, which locks it in at the same time alongside a HF which will deploy automatically within 6 months after segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:13:44
They want the 80% activation to be purely people who support both segwit and the HF. If they left the old activation in you'd have people signaling for "segwit only" confusing the matter.

This is so dishonestly presented. The ONLY option you have presented them is Segwit by itself. This statement reads like there have been multiple options given to miners by core, which is simply not true. You're not willing to compromise at all, and claim that segwit by itself is the only valid option. It's the ONLY thing you have delivered on the scaling debate, yet you speak like you've made multiple other offers, which is not true.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:04:35
Maybe also has something to do with the fact that litecoin committed to a non-witness data blocksize increase beyond segwit, don't you think? Why are Bitcoin devs so opposed to making a similar compromise?
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:47:51
In the COOP proposal, the proposal could hit only 75% support, yet push the original segwit activation to 95% because of people signaling for segwit only. Obviously there are duplicitous ways to pretend to support the agreement but not, but we should not be making it trivially easy to do that.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:43:13

@_date: 2017-05-29 05:27:33
The point of the proposal is to provide a framework for code that enforces Barry's scaling agreement. From a quick readthrough it looks like it could do a good job of that depending on how the hardfork blocksize and block weights are calculated and limited.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:45:50
So I guess you'd prefer something like the COOP omnibus proposal recently on the bitcoin dev mailinglist that makes it easier to back out of the hardfork after you get your segwit? We're not stupid you know...
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:48:44
How does it save covert asicboost? It actually locks in segwit with UASF code so they wouldn't be able to use it for at least 6months till the HF activated, and thrn only if the HF was done in such a way as to allow it, which would be obvious.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:33:12
Who ever guaranteed you a significant decision in bitcoin's direction if you aren't willing to have a significant stake in the system? 
The least UASF users could do is create a sybil-proof coin vote like this:  If you could show an overwhelming majority in a vote like that you'd have some legitamacy, but you're behind by 70,000 coins on some of the statements. Why not prove you have an economic majority before causing a harmful chainsplit since bitcoin has provided us with the technology to do so?
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:29:24
Well don't expect much support from the big block crowd if they think you're just conspiring to deceive them by planning in advance to sabotage the agreement.

Your analogy show's you dont really understand the idea behind bitcoin. You have to get a government license to be a bank. Being a miner is permissionless. Anyone can do it. Theres a difference here, and it's a big one.
But I agree that if a majority of the bitcoin economy wants to fork the network, they could do so. However, I don't believe that UASF has support from a majority of the bitcoin economy. And a UASF with minority miner support and minority economic support is a terrible idea. In that scenario you are much better off just selling your bitcoin's for an altco8n.

All other changes to bitcoin have had overwhelming miner support from the get go. UASF obviously does not. It's not even clear UASF has a significant portion of the non-mining economy behind it, let alone a majority.
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:15:44
It's not necessarily better, but they compliment eachother. If you have miner support, AND support of the economic majority (which is represented by coins controled) it's pretty dubious if someone (UASF) then claims to have an economic majority.
In any case, it looks like Barry has come up with code that will implement segwit through UASF, and locks in a HF for activation 6 months later. What do you think? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:35:43
Users only have skin in the game if they actually buy UASF coins and sell the legacy coins. I think jimmy is saying most users are going to sit on the sidelines and not take those actions, and even if you wanted to, first you'd have to have enough mining power to find a block in a reasonable timeframe in order for you to transact on the UASF chain, or move your coins in advance to an exchange that will support UASF.

Luke doesnt seem to realize this sybil attack problem is why bitcoin uses proof of work to measure consensus. Then the proof-of-work is judged by what is effectively proof-of-stake through economic nodes buying or selling the coins that resulted from that work. Any other system will just be gamed and is a useless metric. The only reason he seeks another method than proof of work is because he doesnt like the result that it generated. No one ever said bitcoin would function exactly how you want it to function.

We don't need *everyone* on the same page. We just need enough. The plan is supported by the Bitcoin industry, 84% of miners, and users such as myself.
You might as well ask me what my plan is if I get hit by a meteor. I can just as easily turn thr tables. What is a UASF supporter's plan if he sells off his BTC for UASF and then realizes he wasn't part of the economic majority afterall? I feel alot better being on the side of Coinbase, Bitpay, 84% of miners, devs like Jeff Garzik and Gavin, etc, than on the side of some random potentially sockpuppet infested reddit users and a handful of autistic devs, one of the loudest of of which actually believes the sun orbits the earth.

I want everyone to support some form of segwit-2mb because I'm a bitcoin user that holds a personally non-trivial amount of bitcoin's and I think it's a compromise that can end the stupid stalemate and I think that's best for bitcoin.
You claim Core isn't centralized, when the reality is that Wladamir has the final say on what makes it into the code. Core has a central point of failure in Wladamir. You can claim if Wladamir got compromised (not clear that that would even be immediately obvious if it happened) that all the other devs would just immediately fork to a new repo. But the truth of the matter is that just because you can choose to leave an organization and start a competitor, doesn't mean that organization isn't centralized. Do you also think Microsoft isnt centralized because if their CEO went full retard, all the devs could choose to leave? The solution is to have multiple implementations of the code, not having "one true code" from one specific group.


How many "true bitcoiners" are there that would abandon Core, 80% of miners, and the major companies in the space? All because they want to avoid a HF because it could cause a chain split? And what's their alternative? To guarantee a chain split by running a UASF instead of going along with the groups described above? Do you not see the irony?

Core has significant influence on the community. If Core releases a HF client that locks in segwit as a softfork and a 2mb non-witness data blocksize at the same time, with the HF activating automatically within 6 months of it being locked in, it would go off without a hitch with at least 80% hashpower supporting it, along with companies like Bitpay and Coinbase. You really think a significant amount of users would reject it?

Lots of companies focused on growth actually lose money for years. Uber has yet to turn a profit I believe. Coinbase was giving out $150 in bitcoin per account opened a while back, $75 for the opener and $75 for the referer (which is now worth 10x the $ than when they gave it away...$1500 per account!). That kinda promotional stuff, when combined with regulatory compliance, website development/maintainance, it all adds up, but it allows them to grab a large marketshare and set themselves up for larger profit in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:26:48
FUD leading up to UASF date leads to a drop. Then when everyone sees UASF failed and it was just a few tards that forked themselves off the network with insignificant repercussions for everyone but themselves, perhaps a small gain.
Segwit2x signaling is scheduled to start July 21, so if it has strong signaling and user support, UASF may become irrelevant before it happens.

It's funny that the hard core small blocker/ anti Chinese miner crowd fails to see this. Litecoin effectively has even higher blocksize through their more rapid blocks than the miners were ever asking for. 
Why aren't they whining about how expensive Litecoin nodes are going to be if they actually get popular enough to fill their blocks? What about all the Somali goat herders with full nodes running on dialup internet that you seemed so worried about? Lol
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:16:01
No, words have accepted definitions, you can't just define them however you want.
UASF is not "employers firing the miners" it's an attempted consumer boycott. When have you ever heard of an employer publicly scheduling the firing of their employee months in advance, and then admitting that there's a chance of failure in firing them if theres not enought public support? The reason is that youre not their employer, your their consumer, and as a consumer, you share any power over them with people like me who might disagree with you. UASF is a stereotypical consumer boycott where you threaten to not buy their coins if they don't do what you want. It's very simple really.


If users are willing to go through the inconvenience of hiring someone else to bypass existing miners, there's nothing existing miners can do about it.
You've just described a stereotypical consumer boycott. If enough people boycott Blizzard's games because of some reason or another, there's nothing they could do to stop it outside of giving into the boycott's demands, or by deciding that the boycott does not represent enough economic power to make the concessions worthwhile. Would you describe game buyers as Blizzard's employers or as their customers/consumers? In the English language we call them customers/consumers, not employers. Using the term employer is just a way to intentionally mischaracterize the power dynamic.
Edit: If you want to say miners have no power, because users could always reject their coins, do you also say that Google has no power, because users could always reject them. Would you say that a president of a country has no power because he could always be impeached, or even removed directly by a coup resulting from a popular uprising? These things have power because even if you remove your personal support, there are other groups of people who you cannot force to remove their support. Just like you cannot stop me from supporting the current miners. You don't have the power to do that, no matter how much you whine.
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:12:55

Gavin modeled the network and found that 8mb is safe. He thought it was 20mb initially, but an arithmetic error was quickly found and 8mb was the correct result. 
Also, it has been argued that the blocksize was always meant to be raised, and the decision to not raise it when the limit was hit was the real change. Have you proven that economic damage to the system is not caused by leaving the blocksize too low? Bitcoin's marketshare has dropped to under 40% on Core's watch, obviously they made a miscalculation somewhere.

@_date: 2017-06-13 23:04:04


I think this is silly too, because even if you think that increases in bandwidth and computing will slow, they're still increasing, albeit slower than you might have first thought, so in the long run my point still holds, even if delayed. Furthermore, if we do hit some brick wall, it still only takes a softfork to limit blocksize to reflect that, and infact even a miner enforced softcap could be effective. In the end there's just no compelling reason to resist a compromise like segwit2x that has broad miner and industry support, even if you think the limit is currently too high, because in the long run, that's irrelevant, even if computing advances slow.

That's a strange position for you to take. Certainly there are many people that think Segwit is good enough that we don't need a further blocksize increase now. And many others that disagree.
But if you really want to think longterm, you would realize that the risk of an additional 2mb or so of effective blocksize on top of what segwit offers is not a risk to bitcoin, because **even if you believe that extra 2mb is too much now**, a few years down the road the advance of bandwidth and computing power will make the effects of that increase on resources required to run a full node negligible, and eventually entirely irrelevant.

The only reason to not care what miners think about issues affecting bitcoin is if you think that miners do not have a long term interest in the health of the bitcoin network. We might disagree on that point, but thank you for at least agreeing that the "miners are just employees so they don't matter" narrative is mostly a distraction from the central issue.
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:55:04
I'm not basing my argument on past performance, I'm basing it on the reality that computing technology **can only go up** over time, unless modern society collapsed, in which case bitcoin is irrelevant anyways, and therefore in the long run such an increase in blocksize is irrevelant to full node burden. People opposed to this potential blocksize increase therefore only have a marginally rational case in the short term, the relevance of which can only decrease in the future.
You can claim segwit2x doesn't have support, but I have seen no such evidence of that claim, infact the opposite. We will see when miner signaling begins and when exchanges will make a choice as to which chain to follow. Before that time it's only speculation because any metric you use besides mining and actually occuring economic activity is vulnerable to sybil attack. The Barry silbert agreement seems to imply that mining power and economic power are in support of such and agreement, but there's no way to be certain until miners start signaling support, mining blocks, and then exchanges and users start moving coins with or without the new rules.
Edit: in any case, we seem to have strayed far from my original point, that there seem to be more nonmining users that don't support activating segwit immediately by itself than you think. This perception is likely exacerbated by the fact that the community is divided, and also by the fact that many, who are frustrated with Core's inability to make a deal with miners, currently have alot of their money in alts, and have less interest in bitcoin these days, many of which might return if the stalemate is broken. Bitcoins marketshare in the crypto economy has dropped by half in just a few months, which suggests people have less support in Core's roadmap than you might think.

@_date: 2017-06-02 15:03:33
Right, and the fact that miners mining twice as large blocks filled with signature bloat is such a lame attack vector it's really not worth sacrificing much of anything to prevent it. Such blocks would be orphaned at a high rate if the miner did not have a very large hash rate, and if they did have such a large hash rate, they could just orphan competing miner's blocks directly instead of sending them bloated blocks.
 
It really doesn't provide any significant useful attack vector, which is why the segwit designers have left it the way it is. Yet it's good propoganda for diehard small blockers to misrepresent the effective blocksize as being twice as big as reality.
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:51:07


Jeff Garzik is writting code. I've seen that several other devs are offering to help and review. It looks pretty promising.
But I wouldn't expect someone named "lite_coin_guy" to be very excited about a proposal that could successfully help bitcoin scale ;). Much better for litecoin prices if we have a nasty chainsplit with UASF, amirite?
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:01:17
People deciding not to buy BTC with their fiat, but instead decide to buy ETH with their fiat, can have just as much effect on price as people deciding to trade BTC for ETH. Doesn't really make a difference in the long run if the pump is coming from BTC/ETH markets or USD/ETH markets.

Well just lower blocksize to about 100kb and you can get more security and decentralization.

This is irrelevant. It's like saying the president only has so much power as the people give them, since their elected representatives can impeach him at any time. Just because there is a theoretical way to remove someone from power, doesn't mean that they don't have significant power. As long as Core can split the community and prevent a near unanimous rejection they maintain power by default, based simply on existing marketshare that they inherited from Satoshi. It takes active effort to remove Core from power, but as long as there is confusion, misinformation, and a lack of alternatives, inaction is enough to leave them in power, and inaction is the natural state.

@_date: 2017-06-14 18:17:40
That's like saying miners dont get to decide anything because they aren't a company. Of course Core has power to decide things, because they have the momentum of historically having a near monopoly on nodes. The handful of a half dozen or so people with commit access and their buddies have significant power over the protocol. To think otherwise is naive. It's like saying America doesn't have any power to decide anything, because American power is decentralized between the executive, judicial, and legislative branches. "America is a decentralized group, so America has no power and can't be blamed for anything they do or dont do." Give me a break with this bullshit that the people with most influence on Core has no power.

You can play with words and pretend that Core has no "official representative", but the reality is that there are a handful of people with a majority of the influence in the decision making process. If everyone has the same power, why do they restrict commit access, and why is there a "lead maintainer"?
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:30:06
What? They specifically state that they still support the new York agreement, and this this is just a contingency plan in case it fails.
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:05:45
You also don't take into account the possibility that increasing the blocksize and lowering fees leads to an increase in bitcoin use/adoption, which means the pool of people that might run a full node increases. Even if you lose 25% of the old nodes, if enough new people start using bitcoin and running nodes to make up for it, decentralization isnt affected at all.

I understand very clearly the roles involved. You're simply under the delusion that being the person who has the final say as to what has 'consensus' or doesn't have it, comes with no power. It does. Dev consensus is not even clearly defined, because that would force people to realize that dev consensus is vulnerable to sybil attack, perhaps through the use of pseudonym as you mention, particularly on issues that boil down to opinions on prioritization rather than black and white technical issues.

There are alot of non mining users that have not accepted your segwit solution as good enough. Alot of them might have been driven out of this forum, and some of them now to have diversified into alts, but that doesn't mean they don't exist...they still have all the economic power they ever did. You cant just blame the miners. The bitcoin community was fractured long before the major miners seem to have taken any interest in the scaling debate, exacerbated by this forum's 'moderation' policies, which I will admit seem much less harmful currently than they were.

What percentage of ACKS are required? And presumably he also has the power to value some ACKS more than others, since some pseudonyms could just be the same person arguing their point from different angles, thereby incentivising him to value the ACKS of his friends that he can actually trust higher. There is obviously power in being the ultimate decider on what level of consensus is good enough. You might argue his power is less than Jihan, but I think you underestimate the value of the number of nodes running Core software that he inhereted, many of which dont pay attention to specfics and just keep their node upgraded to the latest version of core without much thought.
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:34:26
You conveniently left off the rest of my sentence...


If miners were actually your employees, why would you need to campaign for public support in order to "fire" them? It's because UASF is not employer firing their employee, UASF is a consumer boycott, and if you can't see that by now you're a delusional fanatic that is beyond reason or help. An employer has sole descretion on whether to fire an employee, a consumer has to band together with other consumers with threat of boycott because they do not have the individual power to remove the person from their position, but together they can have an effect.
There are several logical positions for not trusting miners or caring what they think, but this "miners are just employees so they don't matter" trope is not one of them, and just makes you look stupid. Youre not doing any service to your cause with this nonsense.
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:28:47
You can't just make up definitions for words when you feel like it. If they're your employee, do you have an employment contract with them? Do you withhold federal income taxes for them? Do you get to set their hours? Do you get to decide what they wear to work? Are you sure that youre actually paying them at least minimium wage? No, you have none of the power that an employer has over their employees. You can only decide to buy the product they are producing or not buy it, which in the English language we refer to as being a consumer, because you lack the additional control and responsibility that an actual employer has, and any financial power you have is dilluted by the thousands of other consumers that they have. This is very clearly misleading language you use to conflate yourself as an employer of miners rather than a consumer. Words have real meanings, you can't just use whichever one you want.
Edit: Also your assertion that there is no third party, there is only the miner and you, and it is somehow different than other companies, is incorrect because many large and small miners are actually incorporated as real legal companies.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:08:45

I can assure you that there is some conceivable scenario that could split core nearly in half. If you look at groups of humans throughout history it happens all the time, even in previously like-minded groups, but this is mostly beside the point. I can agree that Wlad is *incentivized* to some degree to wield his power more gently than if this were some kind of dictatorship, just as the president is, but that doesn't change the fact that he does have power. Can you give us the definition of consensus that Wladamir uses to judge if something has enough support to merge? If we don't have an actual solid definition then it's all up to Wladamir's decrection, which obviously provides him with a degree of power.

If you wanted to be an ass hole mining, and had enough hashpower to create 8mb blocks and not have them orphaned, you could just withhold blocks instead. Remember, this is a feature of vanilla segwit as well, because of the witness discount. Plain segwit supporters were saying that making a spam block by making signature heavy spam does not give an attacker any useful new attack vector, shouldnt be any different in the segwit2x implementation either.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:57:02
You're absolutely right, but you're missing the point. The problem im discussing is not that they have influence on the software.

This is such a bullshit attitude. Miners are users just like you, except arguably more important because they actually increase the security of the network.

@_date: 2017-06-14 21:16:07
Exactly. But the issue I'm discussing is not that it's bad they have power over the code. The issue is that they pretend they don't have any power when it's convenient for them. It's like if the park foundation board asserts power to close the park at night, but then later denies they have any power or responsibilty over the park and claim that they can't do anything about the KKK meetings being hosted regularly in it. "They paid the pavilion rental fee, there's nothing we can do! Don't mind that 2 of the board members are known KKK members, because there are 5 that arent, so that has nothing to do with it!" /s

@_date: 2017-06-14 22:13:03
Only if the decision is a unamimous one. If about half the devs decided to leave, and about half stayed with wladamir, the effect is not so clear.
In any case whether he's kicked out directly, or made irrelevant some other way, is beside the point. Just because you can be removed from power, does not mean you don't have power. Do you think the president of the USA has no power because he can be removed by congress?

Um, how about no? Its effectively 4mb, since segwit by itself is effectively 2mb. Theoretically a miner could mine a 8mb spam block, but they're likely to limit the blocksize to 4mb total if they think thats a real risk.
