@_date: 2018-01-17 18:10:09
You argument is such bullshit. Even though you can 'afford' to lose 30k doesnt mean it doesnt fucking matter youre losing 15k within a month. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:24:44
Well I believe it's headed to 4,000 right now
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:20:23

@_date: 2018-01-17 09:26:46
Yeah well some buyers just lost 50% of their money so yeah, its kind of a thing mate.

Why in GODS name is Bittrex the only exchange trading this thing like 400 dollars below the price on CMC? This is bullshit
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:18:45

The "I could've had X amount of money right now If I didn't (insert dumb trading decision)" is probably the worst thing that can get inside your head. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:22:50
It's fun at times. But sometimes i just get.. tired of it.

If people like this start talking about investing money in bitcoin, its really time to get out.
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:46:45
People forget alot of coins are gone/disappeared/stolen/forgotten.

Jesus christ stop with the 'whale manipulating' stuff already and put on your tin foil hat son.

Ok so we now know the China situation, if we could all stop selling now that'd be great. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:27:53
Any thoughts on the recent rumour China will also ban mining?
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:58:27
Would really like to see 5,5 to 6k one more time and I'll load up big.
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:14:11

I just cant seem to get over this 'crash' thing. Even though the 'news' has been out a few days even though it hasnt even been confirmed and Chinese exchanges didnt receive any requests to shut down prices are still above 4000 euro. Even if this thing 'crashes' back to 3600 or even to 3000 how do we consider that a fucking crash? Wasnt it just over a 1000 dollars 6 months ago??
In a few years time this will just be a small bump along the road.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:32:02
This is the first time Im getting mad. All these gains washed away because of those fcking Chinese again. Seriously, didnt they freaking ban it 20 times already? Whats with the panic man, sell your shit and leave us to it. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 09:37:55
No one seems to realize this is catastrophic for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:44:41
One of the best? Maybe. Potentially one of the worst as well if you owe your landlord money still
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:05:36
While I am 100% aware that no has a crystal ball: What are the odds BTC will actually drop harder than it did already? I mean the news has been out for some time: China will ban ICO's (temporarily), they ban bitcoin (for the 20th time) and it's a weekend again (drops are always imminent on fridays/weekends). 
Fact is: its still well above 4000 which seems to hold really well. Now I am not expecting it to soar to 10k anytime soon but seriously: isnt the fear already calculated or will this go down in waves from now on to about 3600? What are you guys thoughts on this? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:36:04
Lets be clear, JP Morgan had a brokerage department. Which means they buy stuff their clients want and charge a fee on that and make money that way. The screenshot that circles around is by no means a proof the bank itself is invested in btc. People are seriously paranoid and losing their heads in this thing. There is a difference in buying stuff your clients want to have and investing in bitcoin by an investment fund from JP Morgan itself.
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:21:14
Thats great news actually.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:40:55
Its not on their website? Weird.
