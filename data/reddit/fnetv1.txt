I said the same thing when I first heard of Bitcoin in 2013 on national news back in 2013 when BTC had pumped to like $1,000 each, I remember the news anchor comparing it to Gold and all this and that, and me after investigating BTC and seeing how cheaply it was not even a few months ago before that news and specially in 2012, and 2011, etc.  Knowing a little bit about day trading I instantly declared BTC at that level a "Bubble" to crash anytime soon and didn't bough, well Mt.Gox got hacked, $465 million worth of BTC stolen, BTC did came crashing down, I said to myself, there is no way BTC would ever survive this disaster, I remember seeing it go as low as $100 each, and still said nope, that thing is probably destined to go way down than that, no way am I going to just throw off money like that, so once again bought NONE, not even at $100, forgot about bitcoin for a reeeealy long time, now I see its sitting at $17,000 lol fully if I had bought like 10 bitcoins for $1,000 back then when it crashed to $100 a piece I would actually be somewhat well off today.  Well thats my regrets and there is nothing we can do about "regrets", maybe somewhere in year 2042 your wish of using a time machine might be granted at which point you can go back in time to year 2009, download the Bitcoin wallet, dedicate one PC 24/7 and mine the shyt out of it for two straight up years till somewhere in 2011, going back to today you would probably be richer than Bill Gates.
Me having access to a time machine I would probably travel back to year 2009, then go for a shopping spree, I would actually go to a computer store that doesn't exist today, such as J&amp;R Computer World where I would buy like 10 to 20 Desktop Towers where I would have it in a room running 24/7 for the next two years straight up each with its own Bitcoin software installed and CPU mining, then promply hold and absolutely do nothing with those bitcoins till 2018 reaches again,  that would be a full 20x potential there - the richest man in the world by 2018

Talking about anything under 1 BTC is not retarded, not with today's Bitcoin's price of $17,000  For example:  If you need to buy something that costs $1,700 in bitcoins you would be spending 0.1 BTC  If you have to buy something that costs $170 like a new Kingston 960 GB SSD hard drive upgrade at over TigerDirect that accepts Bitcoin directly and pay with Bitcoin, you would be spending: 0.01 BTC, or something that cost $17 like a 64 GB USB 3.0 PNY Flash Drive, would cost you 0.001 BTC, something that costs $1.70 well that would be 0.0001 BTC get the point?  Now if John McAfee, the CEO of Mc Afee antivirus's prediction that by the end of 2018 1 Bitcoin would be valued at $300,000 were to come true, then get ready to even add more zeroes before the 1.  Bitcoin is infinitely divisible so in the future dont be surprised to see people buying something for 0.00000001 BTC

Keep in mind that 300 BTC is only $4.7 Million USD, and I say "ONLY" because if you are not careful enough you can easily blast thru all that and still end up penniless and without a job to keep on living, so back to the 9AM to 5PM rat race (job).  You probably would want to diversify in a good portfolio on DIVIDEND PAYING STOCKS, and then live for the rest of your live based on the Dividend income you would be earning each quarter.  Also, dont forget that if you cash out all those $4.7 Million worth of Bitcoin that you would have to pay capical gains taxes, depending on what state you live, how long you were holding those bitcoins you might end up getting a total tax bill of over 45% of all that in total, thats federal and states included), if you live in a tax free state you will be taxed, I believe to be 35% which I think its the highest bracket.  I think there is a rule if you were holding those bitcoins for 1 year or more, I think the rule talks about long terms capital gains tax percentage fixed at like 20% regardless how high you want to cash out, in that case you only pay 20% of all those $4.7 million taxable income so you are left with $3.76 Millions for your own pockets that you can use to buy dividend paying stocks and live off dividends for the rest of your life.  There are other investment choices too but I believe that the days of earning a 7% yearly return off a money market is long gone. 
Explanation:  Why I say I would invest in a good portfolio of dividend paying stocks?  Well, the temptation to splurge your earnings are always there, you can always buy that $1 million dollar real estate with a big acre (that would probably have a perpetual yearly $27,000 real estate property taxes), get yourself a 2018 Tesla, or even a Lamborghini, limit yourself to exclusively eating Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner at fancy restaurant everyday, going to lots of cruises, really long (30 days) ones costing like $30,000 the package, and on and on, next thing you know, in 4 more years you are broke.  Did you did the right thing?  Nope!  But if you CAREFULLY buy stocks that pays dividends from good companies (Microsoft, and ...... do your research here), I haven't done the math, but I would like to hazzard a guess here, you would probably be earning over $100,000 a year on dividends or more, maybe $250,000 not sure how off I am, all what I know is that is should (or could - can't guarantee here) be sufficiently enough to get you by everyday for the rest of your life - or until the companies you bought stocks from goes bankrupt -- that's why you would diversify into many many companies that pays dividends)
Disclaimer:  This is not tax or investment advice, anything I provided here is provided AS-IS without any guarantees specially when I have not reproduced or own any bitcoins to be able to reproduce that of what I said here but it would be something I would seriously be considering doing had I have been heavily invested into Bitcoin at this time.  Always do your own due diligence before performing your next move if you cash out and if you have to consult any "expert" to help you what to do next, be careful who you trust to hire, not all "experts" would be working on the best on your interests when dealing with multi million worth of dollars.

Since that article was reported on August 04, 2017 and around there she had 100,000 yens worth of Bitcoin where the price of each Bitcoin as of August 07, 2017 was $3,630.92 which would mean that that investment mushroomed as of today to 454,545.45 yens or $4,013.64 worth of Bitcoin, but of course since the news wasn't edited immediately after the murder happened I would have to assume she most likely purchased those bitcoins like a month ago, in that case on July 10, 2017 on the dip of that month, a Bitcoin was priced at $2,236.67, in that case today that wallet's value would be: 737,703.81 yen, or $6,513.92  not bad for an initial investment of $881.00 worth of Bitcoin somewhere around July of last year.  I wonder who might have control over those bitcoin today, The Japanese government, the criminal(s), the victim's family or could they have been liquidated at that time and then proceed given to families.

for a 1/100,000 chance I think its worth buying the hard drive, at least it would be much better odds than playing the lottery where in the lottery you get odds of 1/250,000,000 or something like that at least in the case of powerball/megamillions but each ticket costs $2 as opposed each used hard drive costing $20 give or take.  Odd wise for the dollar it would be: 100,000:$20 200,000:$10 400,000:$5 800,000:$2.50
So, provided that you did spent $20 for one used hard drive to scan if for a bitcoin wallet, and you indeed have a 1/100,000 chance of actually finding a bitcoin wallet there (whether that bitcoin wallet actually has any bitcoins or not, that would be a totally different story), down-scaled to an investment of at least a per $2.50 you will have approximately 1/800,000 chances of finding a bitcoin wallet per a $2.50 invesment whereas playing the megamillions lottery you would have a chance of 1/250,000,000 per a $2.00 investment.  
Conclusion:  Buying the used hard drive makes more sense odd wise per dollar invested.

so, in other words I should be able to solo mine just right on my super fast Verizon FiOS (Fiber Optic) internet connection of 100 mbps.  Before, being able to solo mine a block was determined by how fast your ASIC was, now a very fast 2 TH/s asic wont be enough to solo mine anymore, but with a 2 minutes head start to the competition, the very same 2 TH/s ASIC should be able to solo mine a block before the 2 minutes is up... just saying, pure speculation.

I dont know if you still need this, but if you have not recovered your .TXT file with your private key stored in it, or wallet.dat if you had the full bitcoin software running in your computer, then the following might be of your help.  It is imperative that you make sure not to use the hard drive where you deleted the TXT file, because continued use of that hard drive will risk overwriting the deleted file and if you do that then all hopes are lost.  The best data recovery software that I have used is called "Active File Recovery, its official website is:  You are able to download a demo version, I think the demo version can perform a full scan but recovering files might require paying for the software, but I am not sure if it will let you recover files of file size too small, such as a simple .TXT document which in this case you might be able to recover it for free, so you should give it a try and pray that the TXT file you want to recover hasn't been over written.
If you have an older version of Active File Recovery, such as: Active.File.Recovery.9.5.4 for example, then you will need Windows 7 to get it to run, older versions of Active File Recovery wont run on Windows 8.0 and up even in compatibility mode.  You can create a Windows 7 BartPE CD/DVD or run it using a Windows 7 Install DVD &gt; Repair your computer &gt; via the Command Prompt start the "File Recovery.exe" program.
Well anyways, you will need to get a USB to SATA adapter, plug in the affected internal hard drive you wish to recover the file and then plug in the hard drive using the USB to SATA adapter to a USB port of your PC or Laptop, and then run the Active File Recover program, you will perform a full surface scan, once that's done, you will pick the latest partition that will appear on your left, a quick scan will start, once that's done, you will navigate using its virtual directory tree to the location where you had or think you had saved the now deleted .txt file and if you find it you will right click it and choose the recover option, save it into a USB flash drive you inserted into the computer or save it to the computer's internal hard drive, but not on the same hard drive you had scanned so that you wont risk overwriting the file you are trying to recover.
Hopefully you will be successful.
Remember, halt actively using that hard drive, do not use it until you have recovered your TXT file that had your private key stored.  
If you need more help recovering that file I will be more than happy to help you in anyway I can.
