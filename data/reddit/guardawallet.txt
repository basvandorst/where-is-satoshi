Check out Guarda Light Wallets, available in Web, Desktop &amp; Mobile versions. Quick &amp; secured - that's what we're about. 
If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask. We'd be glad to have some feedback from you :) 
Also, there's a multi-currency mobile wallet for iOS &amp; Android which is about to be released.

Hi! Thanks for your opinion. Guarda strives to provide all-in-one financial supermarket for crypto assets management, featuring all possible options for community members. We have provided this feature heeding the wishes of our customers and it's not a call for action, just to keep everyone updated.

Hi! Thank you for the interest! Our wallet is not fully open-sourced. Despite the huge experience and solid background, Guarda is still a startup with a relatively small team. We are building Guarda as a business without running for ICO, crowdfunding or else. We would like our code to stay intellectual property of the company. If the community wants to audit our code we are open for any closed circuit code review.
