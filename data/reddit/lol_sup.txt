Why do you want to "find clues about his private life and where he is"?

That's kinda exactly what I meant. The "massive hack" was bullshit. It was just a way for them to make off with a ton of your money, and blame it on *gasp* hackers. Do you really have such blind trust for an entity that seems to suddenly be having "hacker" or "ddos" problems every time there's a threat to BTC value?
Please think about it - this is a company which has absolutely NO legal oversight (there is no equivalent of the SEC in the world of bitcoins). They can suspend trading, stop trading, roll-back account values, change anything they want, and they're not breaking any "rules."
I mean, for fuck sake, this used to be a MAGIC CARD trading site!

You guys realize this is a total scam, right?
They're suspending trading because they're freaking out about all the money they're losing (money, which, incidentally, they stole from you, errr, I mean, lost in those "hacks" they experienced).
This is a totally unregulated market, and these guys are fucking scalping the people who've chosen to participate in it.
