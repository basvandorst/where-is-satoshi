So you're saying a bitcoin money transfer to mars would take as long as a USD transfer today does?

That's wrong, it will bring in higher profits on average.

Just turned on 2FA for my Btc-E account, learning from your experience.

I would prefer if the miners came to consensus to give every wallet 1000x the number of bitcoins it currently has. Effectively a 1:1000 split, and no terminology change needed.

Who knows really.
Perhaps one day people on this subreddit will say "Wow, I should have bought mBTC back when they were only 1 dollar each, like they were back in nov/dec 2013".

very hard, if you are a Chinese citizen then you could do this once every 15 days, maybe.

more buying than selling on mtgox since people transfer bitcoin to other places to convert them to usd, since mtgox is difficult to get usd out of.

Coinbase just updated their whitehat to page. The award is now $1000 in bitcoins, about 5x less than it was previously.

If he really cared about the charity he would just choose a more accessible currency like usd.

Sounds like you've been talking about bitcoin all day.

Then I get the private keys that Btc-E also gives you and put it in a new phone.

I still feel like paying with bitcoin is a bit gimmicky, especially with the whole qr code deal. I would be nice if it were as seemless as a credit card payment is, but without the fees.
It would be nice if I could fill a bitcoin debit-card (where the card has its own address that I can use to fill it). Then the vendor can swipe the card and have me enter a pin number. The whole pin number thing would require a middle-man I assume, which would cause to have someone to eat a small fee, but I can't think of anyway to get both convenience and security.
Or some more innovative way for the vendor to get the address in my phone. I could give them a card, which they swipe, causing my phone to get a payment request with the vendor address attached and then I just click confirm.
The problem is that someone has to make this system and people create things only if there is incentive. Vendors inherently would adopt bitcoin because of the possibility of near 0 fees. This sort of convenience system would cost money to create, but no one would want to add fees if they can just do this QR code process.

Just sent my first whitehat report to coinbase :)
