I never made a specific prediction. But I can almost guarantee it will decrease drastically before it increases drastically.

That bitcoin chart is actually for the past year.

Come on...$12K is literally in reach...it keeps flirting with $12K then backing away like a tease.

Let me guess, Andrew Yang?

I don't know what this is supposed to mean, or what it has to do with Bitcoin, but I'm giving it an upvote anyway.

What is this garbage...

I'd like to take this opportunity to point out that when it hit 12k in December 2017, it peaked at 18k just 3 days later. Bear that in mind, weak hands.

Should be a drinking game. Take a shot whenever it goes up a grand. Though you'd pass out pretty soon if you haven't already.

This better not be an April Fool's prank, Bitcoin...

I can’t believe I’m asking, but are you trolling? Or are you for real?

I wouldn't buy it at all right now. It's definitely about to crash soon. Anything that raises in value that high that quickly is bound for a nosedive.

Interesting. Could the "Bull Trap" be the point it's at now?

Which exchange is it?
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:59:57
By "weeks" you mean a month and a half?
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:06:26
Awesome, just need it to go up $1800 more to break even...yay...?

Road to 10,000 let's GO

When everyone is declaring it dead....that's how you know it's the best time to buy.
