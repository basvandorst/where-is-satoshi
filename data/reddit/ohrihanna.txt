You'd think that's why I'm asking about the benefits here. To learn "lol". I don't claim to possess some ultimate truth, I'm trying to understand better.

Source 'usethebitcoin' yeah they aren't biased at all.

Isn't it really risky to put so much money in a prototype?
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:42:25
But isn't having money in bitcoin right now a constraint of freedom? Given the large fees and time it takes to process transactions.

Thank you, I'll give the videos of Antonopolous a try later this day. 
But if bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) will be a medium to make no fee transactions of fiat, this means it's not the intention to replace those established currencies?

Yeah where's the fun if you can't screw yourself over for life amirite?

Yeah but with stocks you can do research about what you're buying yourself into. Is it a healthy firm? Have they got stuff planned for the future etc... Not with bitcoin. Bitcoin is all speculation. People are all interested in it now because of the huge rise it made the last couple of months. But how many actually believe bitcoin will be the currency of the future? 1% allready seems to me like an overestimated rate. I don't believe for one second cryptocurrencies will come even close to compete with fiat money. The argument that is isn't controlled by the government or other banks is plain bullshit: companies that do the transactions and ask fees are banks in the making. 
As for predicting market behavior this is again all relying on some very incomplete information (it's impossible to take all factors into account, hence models), resulting into models that are far from waterproof. It's very hard to forsee crises as they are unexpected. 
I must agree with you on the fees problem but it will only manipulate the market behavior to some level. 
My estimation is that the price of Bitcoin will rise again, because the crash of last week was not big enough a warning, and will crash a second time again before it reaches 25k (or even before 20k) and that will be the end of the bitcoin hype because most people wont trust the currency anymore. I wont test it cause I don't have the money to make it a good investment given the huge risk atm.

I know that's a popular opinion, but I tend to disagree. The larger crowd will react on actions of notable individuals or events. Therefor you can predict what the larger crowd will do **only** if you can at least estimate what these figures will do. 
But in bitcoin even this doesn't hold. In the past when ceo's of central banks or known investors gave advice. People listened. They don't anymore because the mass has become suspicious of the authorities in the financial world. When these guys say how risky bitcoin is, they laugh and say "haha they are getting scared of our revolution haha". The only thing I know is when people panic, they sell, causing more people to panic, etc. But Bitcoin has a small but vocally loud "in-it-for-the-long-term" community and it's like they'll never panic and will hold even when Bitcoin goes down 100% a day.

Bitcoin value can't be predicted like this, just like you can't predict what people will do. Will People who bought at 10k start to panic? Will the big investers think Bitcoin has reached his limit and will they thus sell their assets because it's less interesting? 
Yesterday I saw some guy post a picture of the rise of bitcoin from the beginning till date and put a trend line on it. "You can clearly see the trend is still going up so it's better to buy". Ofcourse It's going up if you started from 0 ffs. 
Anyway, after the correction of last week, bitcoin is even more risky than ever. I don't say don't buy. I say be very carefull and don't buy more than you can afford! It may crash, it may explode again. You can't know.
