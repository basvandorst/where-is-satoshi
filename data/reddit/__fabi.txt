Still a very unlikely scenario.

What has happened will happen again.

He's clearly stating that in the *long run* Bitcoins are going to win. The security problems Bitcoin is facing right now, won't exist in the future. In the other hand, the credit-card-system would need a completely new paradigm to solve the existing problems.

As a programmer and math student, I'm a strong believer that there isn't unsolvable problems. If a problem still there with the actual system, it's because folks are filling their hands with money from them. 
Now you might say, "What problems do we have?". I could answer, well even though I'm not a teacher and I don't enjoy being one, I will guide and advice you to study all the crisis we had in the past; how a corrupted centralized system with eyes only able to see money, forced *thousands of thousands* of people live in the damn street.
You won't find truth coming from folks who the first they think when they meet you is, "How can I get money from this guy?" They will LIE you, they will use every imaginable resource to earn the all wished money, because this is a competitive world but, the software, math and in general the science is neutral.

Because they learned  the "correct" *old and obsolete* way.

I'm not supporting what Newsweek did and I'm against it, instead I'm just saying that Satoshi is still relevant to me and others even though Bitcoin is an open source project.

I share your thoughts. Everyday in the morning I can't wait to get out of bed and check what's going on with bitcoins.

The king of cryptography had his password "hacked"... *Sure* 
If you are going to thing about possible scenarios this should be the last most likely.

We all know the universe is incredible giant, but I'm sure you don't realize how big it's actually.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:52:53
And the fact you can see where the funds are going.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:44:03
If it's needed the Bitcoin software could be adapted to "*anything*". This things are very flexible. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:54:28
Some problems are really old and many guys have promised to solve them however, we still have to deal with a lot of them. Bitcoin is new and your fatigue won't change the truth.

No, you can't start a company and convince institutional investors to trust your company with millions of USD.

A correction, with 120 you have around 1/100000 of all the Bitcoins.
IMO, if you had to spent your life savings to buy only 0.00001 Bitcoins while others have 10.000, you are relatively poor. Generally speaking, I don't think anyone would have a problem with buying a small amount of Bitcoins in comparison to "rich bitcoiners", as long as they don't lose value. Psychologically, a problem is seeing a numerically "small" amount like: 0.00001
Last, the reasons to buy Bitcoins in the late adoption phases are various,diverse and open to discussion(speculate, transfer value, protect your value from certain government policies, etc...)

I know what you are saying and I agree with that however, IMO Satoshi is a very interesting guy; Me and many others probably would like to know some details about him: his personality, his studies, etc...

It's not easy to hoard dollars in Argentina since actually the government limits the amount of dollars you can buy every month and from 2011 it was prohibited. Also if your income is less than 900 USD per month, you can't buy USD and you can't buy goods without the national currency of Argentina which means you have to convert your dollars if you even have and thus pay a premium.
Would be perfect to have a decentralized autonomous central bank not tied to a country which policies are determined by a mathematical adaptable model, some kind of AI able to solve problems and free of human psychology: Bitcoin 2.0

Warren doesn't understand Apple and Google; I'm not surprised he can't grasp the concept behind Bitcoins.

I have a VGA mining rig since 2013. I decided to make one because, I can sell the hardware if something goes REALLY wrong and I'm trying to build a datacenter thus, I can use the MOBO/other components for multiple purposes.
A 7990 isn't a wise choice. That said, you could probably get much more after the 6 months IMO. 
At [you can find useful information about mining and you should read a LOT before doing any investment.

Lies and more lies...

Same here. Today a familiar and 2 of his coworkers contacted me and they asked a lot of things, including how to buy Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:39:45
You don't really need to look at bitcoin as only a currency; it have really many uses.
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:10:49
Really? I suggest you to read the december notice of PBC and actually, I'm a fan of cryptos.

It was a joke but, when the people began to dedicate serious amount of time/money to develop the ecosystem around DOGE, to advertise it, get Dogecoins and to help kids( etc..  it was transformed into something much more serious. Also, the way to advertise it should not be considered as a joke too since, it was a **very** powerful way to attract  people and not just the tech savvy guys but people that was not interested in *any way* about cryptos.
Bitcoin was a joke in the past for many guys too; they laugh at us, they criticized us. But, we are winning the fight. However, many folks around the world still believe Bitcoins are a joke,  like my mother for example.. But I'm converting her.

I'm not good explaining things, but you can do a lot of things with programming. Also, just as many folks would't give their money to ponzi schemes we won't let other deal with our bitcoins so easily. It won't be perfect I know, but still a win over credit card companies.

What's a big blow is China banning merchants to sell goods for bitcoins, and third payment processors to attend bitcoin exchanges, without even trying to incorporate it. Regulation, in the other hand, even if hurt the potential of bitcoins, it doesn't kill them since of it's many uses and merchants at least allowed to deal with bitcoins.

Damn, I remember that post! Thanks MysticFear.
