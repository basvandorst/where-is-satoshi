Thanks man will look on your suggestions.  BTW also appreciate your effort on mailing me the full bitcoin file.  I don't feel comfortable being given something with all the hassles you have to go through  for free.  I'll just try those alternatives you have provide..

That is true.. Trying to look to our local ebay site if there are anyone who sells it.

That 2 gigs a day is shared to 5 people. Internet speed is throtthed to 20kbps after it reached 2gb data.
