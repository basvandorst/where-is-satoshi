Since the big crash the market goes up, then down, then up and then down. Each peak is about half as much as the previous one. The valleys tend to be about the same within 500. Basicly the extremes are becoming closer together until they are about the same, which is where were at now. I for certain saw the patern forming. If you watch anylasis videos for stock markets theres an actual name for the patern (decending triange) Heres a link so you can take a look at some paterns for yourself.  i care not if you believe me nor wether you saw the patern forming in advance. The point of my post was simply to stimulate more bitcoin talk and tell everyone about my journey so far. We are currently at or close to the breakout point. Were either going to break out to the high or to the low, that i cannot say which is why its exciting.

Formatting is messed up i guess becuase im on mobil. When i typed it up it did have paragraphs.
Mining revenue i was speaking of was never mining bitcoin. The difficulty is too high for bitcoin. I am mining eth and yes i am still making about 5$ a day with 4 high end video cards and 2 processors. When i started the revenue was much higher by 2x-3x.

5$ a day ish profit after account for electricity. This is a rough estimate not exact. I also have my cards undervolted to 60% and increased my memory and core clocks.

One very long single paragraph hehe yea i was afraid it would be too long. Im just trying to spark conversation and explain my position. I love bitcoin and i love talking about it.

Thank you for clarifying the transaction proccess. The more you know about what your buying the better. However i do not think your average person would understand the technicals behind the transactions so for explanation purposes i think its easier just to lump this technical analysis into saying that bitcoin are sent and recieved. I think its easier for people to understand even if the underlying process is a bit different, the outcome to the general user is the same.
I agree banks are a long way from being removed and i doubt they ever will be totally out of the picture. I do expect 2nd layer options to pop up in the future and that to me is exciting and i suspect that will diminish the use of the current banking system (not eliminate bit reduce) Bitcoin is the core ledger proccess that works. I expect other companies to build layer which act within their own private network but then gets batched and sent to the bitcoin network for verification.

Please dont downvote me! I love, and believe in bitcoin. But if you want some negatives heres my 1 big one - One of the few things the scares me about bitcoin is how easily you can lose bitcoin if you send it to the wrong address. Imo this is a large risk for bitcoin and mass adoption. I am thinking at some point there will be 3rd party layering (kind of like lightning network or something) that will make using bitcoin easier and more forgiving at the cost of less decentralization for thoes specific transactions/batching. The pros and cons but atleast everyone will have options on how decentralized they want there transactions to be and maybe with the 3rd party layering the ease of use will go up and risks of losing coin will go down which would hopefully help facilitate mass adoption.
