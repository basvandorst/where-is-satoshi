So he is correct but it doesn't matter?

Well, I'd prefer if you just told me, I'm not trying to argue or shill or troll, I really want to understand better. I'm mostly going off things I've read.
So here's a shot: Bitcoin's segregated witness and off chain lightning network is not in the white paper, and there is a worry that lightning payment channels could be controlled/shut down by a centralized authority. Is this a possibility with the lightning channels? If not can you explain? Forgive my ignorance. Does Bitcoin cash contain any technology or design choices that differ from what is intended in the originally whitepaper? I don't know for sure but I was under the impression that it didn't. 
Additionally, though this is not necessarily a purist-technology issue, more of a philosophical + economic one: the thing that really caught my ear and got me interested in crypto currency and block chain technology was the proposition of the internet of money. The idea that people in southeast Asia and Africa and the u.s. could engage in the same economy, amd exchange goods, and services for money without the need for any central authority or middle man to suck out value as an intermediary. I see more and more people pivoting on this, even big names, referring to Bitcoin as being akin to digital gold, saying that a slow moving, high-fee central backing crypto is the way to go. It seems to me that it is becoming something that only the wealthiest people in the world can afford to deal with, and undermines one of the main value propositions (internet of money, global payment system). 
Again, not trying to debate, rather I legitimately have a hard time discerning propaganda from truth on the internet anymore, whether it's u.s. politics, or crypto politics. Any and all unbiased, unslamted, and true information is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Isn't he correct though? So far as I can tell, Bitcoin cash is much closer to satoshi's whitepaper than what Bitcoin is right now. If I'm wrong can you be specific with your explanation of my misunderstanding?

But actually though. Do you realize how silly it is to think that someone selling plants at a farmers market is more or less shady bc they accept Bitcoin cash?

It's a simple question dude.
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:08:06
Can you explain your reasoning? 
@_date: 2018-05-06 03:30:27
But are you capable explaining your reasoning?

The immune system of a decentralized crypto currency is manifesting as a lawsuit? I feel like I've lost the script.
