Not correct. Samourai does have a feature called Stonewall that makes all transactions appear similar to coin joins on the blockchain, and that is enabled by default. No wallet uses coinjoin "by default".
Edit: Also, don't be afraid to taint your coins. They'll never be sophisticated enough to build reliable blacklists, unless everyone adopts that fear and stops mixing.

Most Asian places(at least Thai and Chinese in my area) seem to use Menufy and therefore can theoretically accept bitcoin. But they prefer to use cash or their own credit card system since Menufy takes a huge cut (I think they told me 20% or something).
Basically they probably don't take bitcoin on purpose unless they would have their own BTCPay or similar set up.
Edit: try paying bitcoin in store and report back

Sweet. Can you backfill it with listings from AirBitz and OpenStreetMap and create dummy landing pages for those businesses too? One precaution to take - most of those places seem to be added only because they use menufy, which accepts bitcoin but also takes massive fees. 
Edit: I say this because you may want to flag them and let users mark them as menufy or true bitcoin accepters.

Yes privacy is the biggest issue with bitcoin right now, but with that being said, let me answer your specific question.
Your friend would know you owned at least the amount in that address. Generally you should use a new address for every transaction, so the maximum balance of any address would be the maximum amount you received at any one time. Most wallets will choose the address with the smallest balance possible. 
For example, if you received 10 BTC and then 1 BTC, these should be held in two different addresses. If you send your friend 0.9 BTC, your wallet should send from the smaller output, so friend would only know about the 1 BTC. 
If you send them 1.1 BTC, your wallet would have to use the big output, and therefore your friend would be able to see the 10 BTC.
Once you use your wallet a handful of times (you can also simulate use by sending to yourself) it becomes harder to trace what's going on, so your friend would be less and less sure about your situation.
Edit: as others have pointed out, mixing with Wasabi or similar would help significantly, but depending how motivated that friend is they could still potentially (although not provably) learn some things about your finances. You can also send yourself a small amount using Samourai's Stonewall to make it look like your funds came from a coinjoin.
@_date: 2019-06-15 04:39:59
What the fuck
@_date: 2019-02-21 02:58:07
It's not a wallet per se, but a vault that holds your private keys. I don't think it'll have any transaction ability. Maybe not even a "balance". But it's a start.

@_date: 2019-06-27 12:18:47
There may be something with delays and margins where a flash crash would result in them selling too much cheap bitcoin before they can build their position. That's my guess why they still allowed selling.
@_date: 2019-02-13 02:53:28
Those are some random ass numbers and equations.  What about the current 10 tx/sec limitation vs how many transactions would be needed if one billion people were constantly opening and closing channels?

No the way a pump and dump works is that some party buys up the asset to pump the price, while all the while planning to dump it all suddenly. I don't think its the case, but we can't prove this isn't happening, even possibly at the highest level by Satoshi himself.
Meanwhile the Ponzi scheme is simply not the case, as there are no promises of returns being made by the seller. Bitconnect was a Ponzi scheme.

The answer to your question is probably a CoinJoin mixing using Wasabi wallet. It's a desktop wallet application. You send the funds to a batch transaction along with a bunch of other people and some outputs get sent back to you. From then on it becomes very unclear which coins belong to whom. From there you can send funds to a new mobile wallet or whatever you use.
Samourai wallet's Stonewall is designed to make more regular transactions appear as if they're CoinJoin transactions, adding further obscurity for all parties.

Quick math: If 36 million people each had exactly $1 million and wanted to invest 1% of it into bitcoin, the absolute minimum price of bitcoin to accommodate this would be $17,142. 
This math assumes 21 million BTC in use, nobody else owns bitcoin, and there are no dynamic market forces or demand for bitcoin outside of these 1% holdings.
For 10% allocation with only 17 million BTC in use, $211,764.
For people to actually use bitcoin for even a small number of transactions on top of this, the moon.

Why do you think you can open 60,000 channels in 10 minutes with miniscule fees, and why do you think that number is sufficient for sustained usage? That's what OP is asking.
Edit: To be clear, I'm under the impression you can't and it's not, because you'd have to do 100 on-chain tx/sec to open those. With current block sizes it would at least a day to open one million channels (therefore 3 years to open one billion), meaning block space will get expensive.
That's the question OP is looking to answer.
Edit2: Also 60,000 tx over 10 minutes is only 2,000 tx/sec, not "millions". Are you just trolling?
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:46:42

The fee to open a channel is just the miner fee to add the funds to the "channel" address with the smart contract. The amount of funds is not a factor, but blockchain traffic is.
Currently you can open a channel for a few cents. But if you remember fall 2017 when tx fees needed to be $20 to get a tx through, that could hypothetically happen again and opening lightning channels would then cost that much.
