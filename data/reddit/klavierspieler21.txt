No need for legend. It's art, not map.

There will definitely be a noticeable drop in hashing power every 4 years. I don't think these drops are shown to be devastating, but I think having a smoother incentive reduction is strictly better.

I thought we decided to call this Mentor Monday? It's a bit less insulting to newcomers...

No. Currency quoting convention is ABCXYZ = k, signifies it takes k XYZ to buy 1 ABC. Some exchanges/services still get this wrong.

You only lost your past earnings. You haven't lost your future earnings. You haven't lost your knowledge. You haven't lost your friends and connections. I hope you can see it as a small setback in your journey.

You should really consider not using the default document format from MS Word. It's a detail, but it really shows how professional (or not) you are. I see most of the btc community typing up their stuff with Word and not changing the formatting. It doesn't reflect too well.

I witnessed a personal transaction of several btc go unconfirmed for hours. When going up the chain of transfers, I found the culprit transaction. It's pretty easy to see that Coinbase uses a single chain of addresses to pay transaction costs, so I deduced that all transactions within that chain are Coinbase's.

You might be a bit defensive. I think it's just bad design... look at the other polls, also horrible.

Not "misnomers". Misconceptions.

Why in the world is 'no' green, 'yes' orange, and 'mixed feelings' red? Horrible design.
