Excellent post.  I know that past history doesn't *necessarily* predict future performance, but the peak-correction-plateau-peak trend of Bitcoin is fairly easy to see.  It's happened what, four times so far?  Sure, THIS time could be different...
I think the hardest part is guessing WHEN the correction will happen, not IF.  We could be at the peak right now, or it could happen at $5000, $7000 or $20,000.  We don't know, but a sizeable correction is pretty much inevitable at some point.

Number of Bitcoins in circulation x value = market cap.
So 16.5 million BTC x $3400 = $56.1 billion market cap
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:03:09
21 million, but yeah.

While I have no idea about the limitations of the satellite network they are using, *generally* the big issue with satellite communications is latency, not bandwidth.

When you buy bitcoin, you don't just chuck the fiat into the garbage.  You are literally buying bitcoin from another person, so that person now has your fiat money and can spend it in the regular economy if they chose.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:22:34
Exactly.  Right now could be the peak.  No one knows till it corrects.

I personally do think that the price will come back below current price, but that's just a guess... and to be honest with myself probably me hoping.  I want to buy cheap BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:32:32
I'm really not sure.  I bought low enough that even if it goes down I'm not losing money.  I don't have a ton, so I may just hodl. What I would like to see is a drop down to somewhere around $1500 so I can buy some more.  I have a tough time considering buying right now, when we *could* be approaching the peak.  Again, I have no idea when the peak will be, but anyone that says there will be no correction needs to give their head a shake.  
I truly believe in the long-term grown of BTC, so in theory you could buy any time and still come out ahead in the long term.  But... you could also have way more BTC for the same amount of fiat if you buy in after the correction.  The end of the day, it's still a guess.  I don't even want to guess what bitcoin will do in terms of the numbers, but I would bet all bitcoins that I own that there is a correction coming in the near-ish future.

Because how long you are on Reddit is an excellent metric for predicting future financial performance.
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:00:01
What the fuck are you saying?
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:14:54
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:31:47
Because I have no clue at all when the drop will happen.  I wouldn't want that sell at $4000, just to have BTC peak at $10,000 and correct back down to $4500.  
Like I said, predicting the price is impossible. Predicting that there will be a correction after a huge rise is... frankly pretty obvious.

Crypto steel.  Or just buy a $10 metal engraver and a small strip of stainless steel.

Ease of use.  It's not really feasible to engrave a plate ever time you want to create a wallet, unless you are just buying and hodling.

I'm no fan of JPM, but how is this fraud at all?
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:53:05
Yes, because in its entire history BTC has never made large, long term corrections...
