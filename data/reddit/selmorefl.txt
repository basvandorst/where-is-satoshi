There are companies like [brawker]( that can allow you to buy things with bitcoin online that you may normally not be able to - and vise versa - and also [this news]( is coming, and more of it. I Imagine the %20 OP asked for was for speculative savings and to avoid converting it themselves.

That's actually a pretty insightful answer! I only say that because I had to look it up [here]( :) 
My less insightful response would suggest that much more would be held by a btc style ledger system such as relative values of shared resources; and most pod-people on a 5G VR headset floating in their isolation chambers ordering MRE schematics for their 3D printers using Bitcoin and retina-response interface only would be too traditionally "lazy" to deplete any traditional resource!

This kind of issue. [Reddit: My mom inadvertently ruined my credit score... How do I begin to fix it?](

Not specifically, but in concept. BTC is in essence a recreation of the old ledger/barter system for example. But modern examples of "runaway government" *magically* appear along side the centralization.

Understood, I just hadn't heard that word(s) before. They really invoke the whole picture well for me, and perhaps many others. BTC disciples recognize the beauty of Bitcoin isn't in the coins themselves, but the average Joe doesn't. I just love it.

I have to thank you all for calling me out on that; after reading back and looking at your comments I sure stated a niche *idea* and stated it very matter-of-factly and even used the word "historically." I see how that was off. To try and clear it up I was thinking fairly philosophically, recognizing the "chicken-or-the-egg" nature of at least the American "complex" and the centralization/standardization of the money, or at least since *global* times. Even much of the oppression in earlier cultures required everyone agreeing on some overt exchange such as notes or gold and someone else having most of it, and therefore making all the rules, designed to perpetuate, yada yada... I said it horribly originally and am still having trouble articulating the idea, and maybe someone here more educated and eloquent than I sees what I'm shooting at. But I don't want any of my retardednesses to distract from the fact that at the end of the day my point was to ask a question. And I've gotten some pretty good answers too!

I'd say so. In fact it seems doing so earns you a [documentary](

Social initiatives, from regional to global, via crowdsourcing.

Those three words just blew my mind. Oh, the ramifications...
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:20:25
Well, there you have it. While I'm glad you are keeping the facts clear here, it seems I've gotten no statements correct so far, and as it turns out money has nothing to do with government? I still would prefer to have a real discussion about what sort of "forces" will coagulate in the wake of the Bitcoin system. To me it seems fundamentally different than any exchange system in history, and would therefore drastically change the dynamic of the forces that collect together around it. Am I wrong in thinking this as well?

If history is any indicator, I'm sure somehow porn was the original intent of the blockchain; revolutionizing money is just an awkward consequence.

Digital Identification/Verification

This is beautiful. The integration of the Bitcoin protocol with basic cryptography is slowly going to change everything. The concept of a "paper wallet" is still voodoo to most people, but the lines between digital and analog are slowly being erased. I would be so interested to see what parts of society utilize and become impacted by basically just QR codes (edit: ..and/or mnemonic phrases) 20 years from now.

Very possible, though anarchy connotates chaos; but "crowdsourcing" social issues and guidelines suggests the opposite, and I would think both could be possible scenarios.
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:30:12
Very true, in context, I guess governments aren't newbs, and it did, indeed, spawn gox...
