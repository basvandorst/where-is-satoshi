Trollbox has nothing to do with the admins if the site. You probably list money on one of these pump and dumps and now angry. People like you are the ones that like the new chat restrictions, such as the $100 having to be in the account and what not. Raise the limit to $100k and I'll still be there to troll your ass.

How am I the moron? Are you jealous you're broke? I'm not the one bitching about BTC-e not withdrawing shit. "Im not dumb enough to put money on btc-e.com, so no, I didn't lose any. Its rigged and manipulated. There is no transparency" Yes, you are dumb, and you're enough for anything, fool. Nothing is rigged but your bitch ass. Enough of your FUD.

It's the same picture, I just blacked out the extra stuff. I don't see a point of this? He still said what he said regardless...

I've never wired money to BTC-e, but I have withdrawn numerous and decent amounts of LTC and BTC before. Ranging from 500 LTC to a few thousand LTC without an issue. I've withdrawn over 20 BTC over the past month without an issue. When I have USD, I sell BTC-e codes for PayPal then withdraw to my bank. All crypto deposits have worked for me fine, just one LTC deposit with a 5 min delay.. I don't know how this happens guys, but just because a small group might have a delay doesn't mean the entire website is a scam.

No one us getting scammed. It's simply your impatience causing paranoia.
