I only had BTC there, I'd be very happy with 50% today + 2% per month. They can't pull $70,000,000 out of their couch cushions, so I'd be happy with payments. The problem is that I haven't seen Zane suggest that as a possibility yet, so far he has only mentioned a subsidized loss, which would be especially heinous if they continued to operate the exchange.

Indeed, there is still ~$40,000 worth of Unobtanium there. From watching the blockchain it appears that people have used it to withdraw thousands of dollars of value off of Cryptsy. 
I don't understand why people are selling it there though. Either some people actually are able to withdraw bitcoin, they are unaware of the withdrawal issues, or they are embracing the small premium and hope that they will be able to withdraw in the future.

I understand the concepts discussed in this thread, what I don't understand is how an attacker would use that information. So they know 6 addresses containing 5 bitcoin each all lay in the same wallet....now what? They hack into the bitcoin mainframe to steal the coins? (joking) I don't see what an 'attacker' would do with that info.
I think those transactions are more likely the work of tracking and compliance companies such as chainalysis. They are working to map the blockchain to put a name behind addresses &amp; identify addresses behind illicit activities. This helps companies like Coinbase &amp; Circle to comply with AML &amp; other laws. Many users have reported having these small transactions sent only to addresses they sent to *from* coinbase or circle. This implies that coinbase gives a name &amp; addresses to chainalysis, who then follows the trail of crumbs. I think that's more likely than 'attackers' unless you can explain how they would benefit from that info other than losing a few cents at a time.

Nope! You can go altcoins -&gt; BTC, as well as between altcoins. Be aware of the rates you're getting though. Rates are often bad alt-to-alt, but it's mostly due to liquidity issues in the markets (I'm guessing).

This was a really good outcome all things considering. Although it also sucks that he had like $2,500 in assets seized, I was surprised that there was apparently only 3 bitcoin on his computer. They probably stormed in and grabbed all his electronics but didn't see the paper wallet with 200 bitcoins taped to the top of a kitchen drawer ;)
The major issue here seems to be that he cannot leave Nevada during his probation, which the duration of has not yet been defined. I suppose swcpoker (the new site) has other people able to take control while Micon is away, then he will return to it after probation. 
It's kind of funny that the probation is basically a time-out punishment before he returns to the Caribbean to continue running a bitcoin poker site. It sounds to me like Micon wins here. The government gets a one time payment of $25k and a few computers, but they lost time of lawyers and judges and forever miss out on tax money from swcpoker.eu

Theoretically if a fork was unsuccessful, but after 100+ blocks of it being mined somebody sent coins from the new, failed fork to large addresses, could those addresses be tainted? That seems like a concern as it could be even done maliciously, but it's very likely I'm missing something or misunderstood something. 
Also it doesn't seem that unlikely to me that two chains could survive for 100 blocks, that's only about 17 hours. It seems like it would take more than 17 hours for many miners to evaluate the situation then device on and prepare for any changes. 
Thank you for the concise response.

With regards to the verification levels at poloniex and how it compares to the fiat&gt;crypto standard: The identification requirement applies to even crypto&gt;crypto trading or to lend or withdraw crypto.

Looking at it that way is irrelevant. A market cap of a few billion dollars, for such a new and revolutionary currency, is prone to high volatility. If bitcoin began actually catching on across countries price would be much higher, and from a % perspective, volatility would be less severe. 
When topics like Greece and Venezuela are mentioned, there's not really an implication that using bitcoin over the last few years would have solved their problems, but that they have reasons to benefit from it in the future. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 14:42:59
The fees are 15% of what you earn from lending.
So 8.64%*0.85 = 7.34%. It would actually be higher than that since the interest compounds every 2-30 days (depending on how you structure the duration or how your orders are split.)

Loaning bitcoin on bitfinex right now gets you around 0.024% per day.
I have yet to look into that 5% figure but it seems there's something I'm missing, or it's the best deal for crypto lenders anywhere. Even 5% per month would be really high. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 00:14:06
That's great! I'm super excited about using this and its potential. You need 3 things and this will get really popular.
1) ~~Ability for broadcasters to show their screen. The best option may be to utilize 'stream keys' like twitch so users can broadcast their videos with formatting, sound adjustments etc. I'm not a programmer though so for all I know that would be hard as hell P2P.~~ Just use xsplit to show your monitor through webcam (or another virtual cam software)
2) Chat box
3) List of currently streaming channels, (if users choose to go public).
I know those have all been mentioned but I think it is very important. I stream on twitch regularly, but would completely switch to this if the changes are implemented. I'd happily donate a percentage of my 'revenue' from broadcasting to the devs as well :)
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:58:29
What kind of action though? Boycott poloniex? Organize a mass protest to demand that the U.S. government doesn't involve itself in crypto transactions?
If the demand for anonymity in crypto continues, which it likely will, there will still be mixers, anonymous coins, decentralized exchanges, localbitcoins, etc. to fill that demand. But there's no greater reason to get upset about this than about a U.S. stock broker requiring information to create an account.

Just realized, it says "up to" 5%, lenders set their rate, so a fare rate will be determined by the 'free market' and likely fluctuate at well under 1%. 5% is just their cap. Although I could see it averaging a higher rate than the bitfinex lending market, since altcoins and poloniex are slightly more niche.

Can you articulate on this point a little more? Everyone knows the Winklevoss twins own 140,000 bitcoin. Many people are known millionaires and don't have personal security guards. Hell, it's a fair guess that any random person with a white collar job and a nice car probably has 19k stashed somewhere, but I'm not aware of too many hostage situations or kidnappings for ransom. 
I suppose if bitcoin shoots up to $20,000 per coin, he stored all his funds in one address, and listed that as a donation address on a website associated with his real name and home address. *Maybe* some nefarious person would plan something. Perhaps the odds are higher if he lives in a dangerous developing country?
I would appreciate any more information regarding this point though.

Because this is done in a way to provide information to researches &amp; analysts. If the system and its users actually provide useful data, then it can even help people to make decisions for the future. Sports betting is a prediction market in a way, but you can't really provide value to humanity through it. 
Perhaps the biggest difference though is with sports betting the odds are often calculated and set beforehand by the broker, in a prediction market the users themselves set the odds. While the former does have predictive value because experts are using information from the past to predict the future, any informed analyst can do that. This harnesses a different level of resources, the perspectives and information from thousands or millions of people.

I was told by OldManKidd (poloniex employee in the trollbox) that withdrawals made even in the 2 day warning period will require name and country, but that identification level will not be restricted by the $2,000 withdrawal cap until the 2 day period is over.
In bitcointalk people are saying that they just put a fake name and were able to withdraw, since no identifying documents are required until the $7,000+ level. I used my real name though because I trade small amounts, will include trading profits/losses in my taxes,  am not doing anything illegal, and would rather stay in good standing with poloniex (smooth site, low fees).
I do understand why this is upsetting some people, but I think there will always be ways to stay mostly-anonymous with crypto, and there are currently exchanges that don't require identification for crypto trades. There's not anything poloniex can do when being pressured by the U.S. government. Maybe they could move overseas, but they've got a good thing going and offering more transparency to regulators could legitimize them to a wider audience. 
The requirements are pretty mild anyway, if you've got something to hide, put in a fake name and withdraw, but I doubt most users have anything to worry about. I don't think there's a spy agency analyzing every $50 poloniex withdrawal, it's that now users may have SARs filed against them. I'm not sure the extent of SAR triggers or how much government can stretch them on demand, but I wouldn't worry unless you're moving high 4-figures+ through monthly and failing to file crypto trading on your taxes. Or withdrawing directly to a known darknetmarket vendor or something :p
Just trying to be realistic.

okay, I'm not trying to argue. It just seemed like you were implying the poloniex rules wouldn't apply to crypto&gt;crypto trades. Poloniex doesn't trade fiat so if you're right about KYC/MSB rules why would they be implementing identification requirements at this time?

Hasn't that been known for nearly as long as brain wallets have existed though? The [brain wallet wiki page]( literally says not to use them. 
I think they're still okay as long as you make them very complex. Your 10 closest family members first names backwards with one digit of your phone number at the beginning, and one digit from your social security number at the end of each word. Then toss some other unusual words at the beginning and end. Something like that. I've heard that for years there have been machines persistently scanning millions of potential brain wallets. During the recent 'stress test' some of the spammed coins were found in a brainwallet with the phrase "cat", apparently the single word wallets are found in seconds. 
.....so what's new here?

Absolutely, most cryptopoker in browser on mobile/tablet is not great. As said above, you may have to wait for the swcpoker app, it has been in the works for months, but once it's done it will be epic with all those poker variants, it may even catch on in a big way. 
I know bitspoker, betcoin &amp; Nitrogensports don't have android apps. You'd think maybe ACR would but it's not in the play store, maybe google wouldn't accept it due to the legal gray-area situation.

They charge 2.9% when buying with a bank card, it's only free if you link your accounts. 
There is also an ~$3 markup per bitcoin compared to market rates, it's the same 'markup' in bitcoin/USD valuation whether you're going fiat&gt;bitcoin or bitcoin&gt;fiat, so the markup doesn't effect you if you buy bitcoin, hold it waiting for an increase in value, then convert it back to fiat into your bank account. but I imagine they get more fiat&gt;bitcoin volume as people buy to hold, spend, gamble, trade for altcoins etc. I suppose it could hurt the company if there was a massive bitcoin&gt;fiat stampede through their service, but that seems unlikely.

Lately I've been working to clear some bonuses on ACR (which also accepts bitcoin and has a massive ring-game player pool, but withdrawals require identity verification). I will definitely return to Betcoin for most of my play when I'm done for the following reasons: Better rakeback, lower rake (I think, at least for low-medium stakes), 2-factor authentication (recently added), table-starter rakeback (recently automated), and to support a bitcoin-only poker site.
Why do you ask?

@_date: 2015-09-27 20:39:08
For sure. The first step is creating an impressive client, website, support etc., then step 2 is marketing properly. Centralized cryptopoker sites like swcpoker and betcoin have gotten about 70% of the way to step 1 and 10% of the way to marketing properly. Cypherpoker is currently at like 5% and 1% respectively, but in regards to innovation, fees and novelty it's at 100%. 
My point being that marketing is secondary but still absolutely crucial to large-scale success, and most cryptopoker sites fail miserably in that regard.

Your submission to and previous submissions there by the creator were largely ignored or downvoted. You'd think poker players would be a bit more interested in modern advances but a lot of them just seem stubborn and not inquisitive. 
This is really exciting stuff though. It may take a while to catch on, but in 25 years maybe a majority of online poker will be played in this way. As I understand it the program is still very crude. Although Patrick is clearly bright, there is only so much a lone programmer can accomplish in a year. It is still not possible for players to simply join a game, they must download the software from github and be explicitly invited from another user or invite people themselves. It is essentially a skeleton at this point, there are dozens of basic features that are not present, all of which are important to online poker players. If all goes well these are temporary problems, but I wanted casual browsers to be aware that this is not a flashy new product. 
Version 2.0 may be a big improvement, since that is when he will add bitcoin integration and possibly other features. If any groups spring up around this project I will join in and add my action to the tables, but I do not see this catching on to more than 100 players for a few years. Tiny rake and lack of centralized risk are not enough to draw people away from flashy 10,000-user poker sites to a clunky program. 
There are some other projects in the works using Stellar and NXT, but those are equally as obscure and unfinished.

I think that's also assuming that their wife doesn't open their bitcoin wallet, search the transactions in a block explorer, then identify that the receiving address belongs to a camgirl... Perhaps the camgirl would just use the same address for all clients/all transactions and it would appear in a google search?

It would have been nice if he added "Of course the phrase 'hello tedx' is too short and would be stolen within hours by scanning computers, so people must use a long phrase that they can remember with some numbers and characters". 
Currently it is not practical to imagine a large number of families fleeing from a town of rubble to have access to bitcoin and the internet, go to a brain wallet website, create a long phrase, "fleeing3 syria7 for3 italy7 please4 god8 bless4 us8 on5 our9 dangerous5 journey9", send the funds there, then remember it at their destination. However in a few years with mesh networks or global satellite internet and a much wider prevalence of bitcoin it is possible. Possibly the biggest issue right now would be getting bitcoin in the first place, there's no local bitcoin activity or Coinbase presence in Syria or North Korea. I suppose in countries with internet and some freedoms like Ukraine or Nigeria it is more reasonable.

Ah, thank you. So it sounds like may be that poker satoshi. I wouldn't say that they have 'messed it up' so far, people just rushed in to apply the conventional models of fiat poker to bitcoin poker. A whole new infrastructure is apparently not an easy thing to do, so a few skilled people have been working on it for the last year or two. The rest just bought or created conventional clients and used bitcoin as the currency to enter the market quickly. It has solved some of the problems, such as U.S. citizens getting funding to the sites, it's just not taking advantage of all the opportunities present with bitcoin.

It's not like we're forming a lynch mob. If there really is something going on, 'the internet' should discuss it so that users can be informed and evaluate whether they should keep funds there.

Good points there. I used a couple of the withdrawal coupons. People were rather flustered about not informing users beforehand but those withdrawal coupons were a fair move. I guess the only people that could say it's unfair are those with large amounts of more than 3 different cryptos which they don't want to consolidate into a few coins before withdrawing. 
I would not be surprised if every crypto exchange was being investigated by multiple agencies. I'm just not sure why they'd single out Cryptsy or if they would (or *could*) do an intensive investigation without informing anyone at the company. I'm inclined to believe Cryptsy here and I wish you the best. Though I'll be keeping my funds away until all this drama blows over or is resolved. 
Just please listen to all of the people saying negative things about the interface. Most of that is genuine. I personally am not pleased with how significantly the information available to traders is limited. Have a look at Bittrex's distribution data (I was told by someone at Cryptsy, maybe you, that such information is like a bank putting all their cash in the window, but we can already see your balances in block explorers.) Also see how Bittrex and other exchanges allow users to scroll through the entire order book, the Cryptsy order books and depth charts are *extremely* limited to users. There are many things like this which could be better but the latest update to '2.0' just added things like spread% and a sponsored coin bar.

I was once returning to the U.S. from a Canadian casino &amp; declared that I had ~$8,000 in cash. They began scanning my car with density meters and dogs, then escorted me into a small metal room with two very serious men for about an hour. One man interrogated me and used little bits of my answers to accuse me of things then stared at my face intensely while analyzing my reaction. During this time the other man counted every dollar I had and scoured the crevices of my jacket pockets. The entire time not a single person cracked a smile, it was rather stressful and only made it so I was much more tired while driving home. Not that it should matter, but my vehicle and appearance are basically the opposite of anything they'd ever 'profile', so it was purely about the cash. 
I would much prefer to cross the border with $8,000 in bitcoin on my cell phone, wouldn't even need to declare it. If you're reading this Canadian casinos - Accepting bitcoin could make it more likely for some of your American high-rollers to return to your casino since they won't have to go through hours of being treated like a criminal by their own government. 
BTW - The reaction of the Canadian border guards when crossing into Canada with that much cash? "Okay, have a great night."

Why didn't you withdraw after the recent Coinfire article? If you have enough funds there to give you a panic attack you should withdraw most of it. If it's in orders for a big trade then diversify to other exchanges. If it's just sitting there then send it all to a secure wallet. If you're concerned about the 0.5% withdrawal fee (which you shouldn't be since I'd give Cryptsy higher than 0.5% chance of becoming insolvent/frozen by the government) then be aware that you probably have 3 'withdrawal coupons' which waive the fee.

Assuming this is a smear campaign, what kind of group do you think is behind it? Competing exchange, trolls, or our love of drama coupled with some users facing restrictions due to AML/KYC laws? 
It seems odd that CoinFire would completely fabricate such lengthy and detailed accusations. It doesn't seem like a hack since the article is still up, but would they do it just for ad revenue or to receive money from a shady exchange? 
I'm not on any particular side here, just trying to figure this all out. I think you guys are doing a good job of defending yourselves and you are being convincing. I've never had troubles withdrawing but it's such an odd series of events (sorry if I have the timeline out of order &amp; anyone please add more recent events if you know of any)
* Paycoin controversy
* Sudden switch from trade fees to withdrawal fees without warning coupled with an underwhelming site update
* CoinFire article revealing/fabricating large cross-agency government investigation. BigVern defends on Twitter and in a Cryptsy Blog post
* Bitcointalk lawsuit thread with solid responses from Cryptsy but many complaints from users. 
* Withdrawals delayed/halted citing malleability problems causing database issues. An unusual number of wallets in maintenance. 
* 2 blog posts compiling the bitcointalk complaints which were subsequently deleted due to threats of suing for slander.
* Announce new Cryptsy Mastercard
* Twitter account  trying to scam people
* This post about Cryptsy employees interviewing in Florida which you say is unlikely or untrue.
I still don't really understand the switch from trade fees to withdrawal fees. To a lowly trader that seems like it would result in a significant loss in revenue but could be reasonable if you were trying to encourage users to store funds in Cryptsy. It just seems like an odd decision that no other exchanges are doing, but maybe you can explain.

Yes, you've made that clear and in my mind that is most likely the case. Just look at it from the perspective of a trader with no involvement in the company. If you saw articles like these wouldn't you feel that it is in your best interest to move most of your funds from that site to personal secure storage? 
I imagine with your fee structure recently shifted to withdrawal fees you guys wouldn't mind some FUD to compel users to withdraw. In fact, the best scenario for Cryptsy would be if most traders deposited to make a trade then immediately withdrew, you'd be earning 0.5% per trade instead of 0.25% as before.

**These would relate to coinbase:**
- Many funds transfers are sent in large, round dollar, hundred dollar, or thousand dollar amounts.
- Funds transfer activity occurs to or from a financial secrecy haven, or to or from a higher-risk geographic location without an apparent business reason or when the activity is inconsistent with the customer’s business or history.
- Funds transfer activity occurs to or from a financial institution located in a higher risk jurisdiction distant from the customer's operations.
- Large, incoming funds transfers are received on behalf of a foreign client, with little or no explicit reason.
- Funds transfer activity is unexplained, repetitive, or shows unusual patterns.
- Funds transfers are sent or received from the same person to or from different accounts.
**Some silly ones (unrelated to coinbase) that are supposed to raise suspicion of money laundering:**

Yes, with some coins you can verify that they have healthy reserves through a block explorer. For some reason they now keep their entire $50,000 Unobtanium balance in 1 hot wallet, so you can see every time someone withdraws. This won't prove that they don't have fractional reserves since you don't know the total that they have credited to accounts, but you can at least see that nothing catastrophic is happening with their reserves for a specific coin and that you can withdraw through it.
