Bitcoin is like ethernet or tcp/ip in comparison to the internet, with this being the internet of money. Each on their own are kind of useless to some extent, it’s the layers that make up the internet, much like what we’ll with Bitcoins development, this is where we’er headed. So it you’re out, or betting against bitcoin, it’s kind of like betting against the internet in 1994
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:28:58

I paid $5 for 1000 dogecoin thinking I was getting in on the next big thing, the new bitcoin from some guy at work. Suffice to say that wasn't the case, now I took what i could scrape together and converted my modest amount of doge to bitcoin, yay me for the win! ha

Hey, cousin dxplq876 twice removed on Aunt Brenda's side, Merry belated Christmas. I didn't even know this could be done, I have a lot to learn. I've just downloaded multibit wallet but have yet to figure out how to get bit coin to it. I've tried online tasks to earn a small amount but I've yet to find a site that doesn't hold it till you reach a minimum.

@_date: 2014-06-30 00:12:44
She doesn't get the physical money and I don't so much care for the amount of the coins worth. I bought 10,000 to send her in an allowance fashion and let her pay for things what their worth. I thought it was a neat experiment with what I feel is the future of money. She's almost 4 so when we go out and she wants a chocolate bar she pays the items worth. 1 coin = $1 dollar. She understands she gets them for being good and helping out and in turn I allow her to pretend spend them at the exchange of Dad.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:42:03
Someone tipped me the other day and I was like wtf, bitcion tips?
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:37:16
Haha, I just said it's like dogecoin with some value. This is a strange day, but cool?
@_date: 2014-07-04 13:25:02
No kidding eh. I feel like i should become a bitcoin beggar. People are accidentally sending 800 coins to a closed GOX address and I can't even seem to accumulate 1BTC.....maybe someday. At least this story turned out good.
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:34:00


This part just sounds like they won't allow an account to be used to exchange for bitcoin.

I can see your point. I'd hope that's not the case. I'm a cynic when I see 4yr olds with Lemonaide stands accepting Bitcoin too. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:52:36
It's what gives doge it's mass adoption. It's a, "hey how you doing, come visit and stay a while, we're pretty awesome". It's infectious.

Excuse me if I'm wrong, I use bitcoin to purchase gift card, the card is electronic and on my phone via their app? I'm not waiting for a physical card and I'm not required to make the purchase in store?

Just found out it' TIP DAY
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:13:02
I think the decrease in price is good for Bitcoin. With growing adoption there will have to be a phase of depreciated value as these new companies dump a larger portion of coins on the markets driving down price. Once people start making mortgage and car payments with bitcoin and companies hold and spend and pay employees with bitcoin, prices will sky rocket and won't come back down.
@_date: 2014-05-31 21:06:56

Yah i got suckered by GAW, it sounded cool, then I lost 1btc to mintpal/moolah and sold what I had in cloud mining so I didn't miss a payment on something shiny for the hope to be Mrs :)
TLDR, I'm dumb, got scammed fingers crossed

Perhaps you don't have children? My soon to be 4 yr old operates our smartphones at a proficiency level of an advanced senior citizen. When I send her coins and it chimes she understands she gets money to spend on candy and things. While of course they don't grasp the technical side, they don't need to understand fractional reserve banking to understand something = ice cream. The token is irrelevant. Kid's are much smarter than you give them credit.

I felt horrible because I enjoyed seeing the daily return and and the other day I won a halloween Haaashleet which is just a 1mhs prime with a skin on it, sold it for $300 ( not sure how ) and after reading this it just makes me want to take my money and run. Was going to put it back into getting my miners back. Thanks for posting this.

I can do this?
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:28:25
I couldn't disagree more, price reflects adoption on a larger scale. What i meant to say while adoption is important now it will hurt the price short term unless the merchants accepting bitcoin hold their bitcoin. Large swaths of coin dumped for fiat is a huge problem as we're in an adoption growth phase, my two satoshi's.

I know this is a much smaller scale but I too had a few hundred dollars in referrals that were well past the 60days, and they removed them all from my account saying those other account became inactive. Stay away from Bitgold
@_date: 2016-06-03 01:22:33
I think the only solution is to give back everyones referral gold and allow them to withdraw it :)
@_date: 2016-06-02 23:54:19
You did the same thing to me too. What if I had withdrew those funds prior to you "reclaiming", the real word here is stealing them. Would you then drive to my house to reclaim that gold due to inactivity on another party even though you initially held it for a 60 day probationary period. 
I joined up and spent a lot of time providing you free marketing/advertising via social media in an attempt to purchase my first bitcoin, you then remove the ability to even redeem in bitcoin, which was "coming soon" for a year. Then you take my actual funds too. Fuck you!
@_date: 2016-06-03 00:04:19


@_date: 2016-06-03 16:55:58
Guessing since it was Bitcoin deposited for Gold. The Bitgold site also offers the ability to deposit but not withdraw in a variety of crypto currencies.

@_date: 2017-08-22 05:29:18
My Dad who I got into crypto replied with, " I don't want that shit(bch), just sell it for me and I'll add more bitcoin to my pile". So what's your point? That's right you had none, just shilling BCash.

I guess counterfeit goods is cheap, and if you don't care about utility, sure why not, it's new and shiny, just useless and with little to no support outside a few parties.

@_date: 2017-08-04 16:14:39
I think it's because of a few bad actors trying to undermine Bitcoin without actual consensus. That and the fact that by it's own name is trying to ride off the notoriety of the bitcoin brand instead of it's own merits as  say WuCon or VerBit.

@_date: 2017-08-04 15:47:02
I don't see why anyone would put money into BCash outside trading. As someone who'd likely be considered a commoner amongst the bitcoin population, the idea of purchasing or more insanely giving up my bitcoin for this, just seem asinine. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:02:54

@_date: 2017-08-25 16:58:26
This post reeks of Troll.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:01:17
What BCash wallet did you use, going to do the same, but not sure which wallet to trust. I've already moved my coins to a new wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:07:10
If you've spent anytime there, there is serious talk about " the flippening".
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:59:07
Shapeshift isn't an approved payment gateway with Shopify. You can always integrate GoCoin to accept Litecoin, Bitcoin and Dogecoin though.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:07:15
No one's piling into BCash, it's a market that's being manipulated and controlled by a few bad actors. It's not the "real" bitcoin, it's a poor attempt at a hostile takeover by the counterfeit bitcoin who's entire notoriety relies on the bitcoin brand.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:59:59
that doesn't send up red flags or anything
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:09:01
Is it locked in, or activated?
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:45:44
That's what Litecoin is for BCash hold no utility
@_date: 2015-08-31 15:31:42
I don't even have an option to add an account. Was just told by their customer support it's first day bugs. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:20:13
~~15k~~ 100k corrected that for ya ;)
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:41:47
I don't think the core devs would let it die. Scalability is inevitable, but this isn't the way to do it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:47:19
I would argue moving the coins was doing something, whether they were dumped or not, it was used to build false confidence in BCH. Least for this round.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:47:19
So do 100's of other alts, what makes BCH stand out from them, nothing, outside miner manipulation and 90% of all hash power coming from a single person who controls the direction of BCH. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:17:09
It still feels like a huge setback for bitcoin adoption. If public loses confidence, it won't matter who's viewed as the hostile party. This whole shit show, just looks bad.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:46:28
@_date: 2015-08-25 00:49:47
I support bigger blocksizes, but not Heard or XT.

 How is the pvt generated from this? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:51:10
It's value is derived purely from it's Airdrop to current Bitcoin holders. It this would have been it's own coin, instead of riding Bitcoins dick so hard, it be completely worthless. For now it's utility is  a whiny millionaires pump and dump coin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:04:58

...Said the bcash reddit troll and his 5 day old account.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:05:43
Better get that back while you're up
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:34:01
I guess eh, if XT does get consensus though, can we just call it Bitcoin and at least hire a web dev to put together a decent site :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:27:16
Fees and transaction times, thats your selling point? You mean litecoin, BCH does what litecoin does, with less utility, one shit dev, and not an ounce of innovation, schnorr, mast, segwit.....big blocks lol
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:53:28
It's the coup!
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:46:52
The only reddit folks supporting 2x are BCH trolls hoping BTC fails
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:54:47
It does, just not in GUI. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:41:56
Haha, in 6 months, you'll be holding a bag of knock of btc
@_date: 2015-08-31 15:02:33
Yah ok, then it's not just me. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:21:16
If anything this hard fork will turn away general interest in Bitcoin/Bitcoin XT and will be a huge setback for the progress of a greater public adoption of Bitcoin as a whole.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:23:31
Sad new accounts for trolling are sad, makes baby satoshi cry
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:54:42
Same here, I'd rather the Core implement the same patch. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:44:36
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:21:41
Exactly, BCH's big selling point is native to a variety of coins except 90% of the hash is controlled by one party. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:38:54
BCash is a riding a pump, wait till January when coinbase gives it's users access to dump.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:48:33
Ya, guess that makes sense. I'd still prefer to see this implemented with the bitcoin core rather than a fork. I think the fork is a bad idea (confidence/marketing/public perception, etc), even if I'm not opposed to the reason behind it.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:48:05
I haven't...I support a larger block size, but not XT or Mike Hearn.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:25:00
I do too, all and all it's pretty shitty. Linear on chain scaling is the death of decentralization, not innovation, it's a political move disguised as a technical argument and so many people are going to get rekt.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:48:05
BCH doesnt even compete with Litecoin for features and utility, good market manipulation at the moment, but hedge with BCH, fuck no
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:48:02
Because it's not, no matter how hard you wish it
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:17:40
They even have a bot that now comments if you try and use "BCash" with "It's Bitcoin Cash not bcash ok???". 
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:43:08
This still feels like a coup I can't support, even though I agree we need to scale.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:46:37
The argument that BTC is inherently slow and BCH is fundamentally faster leaves out the premise that BTC will have the same advantage, add to this sidechain technology, segwit, schnorr, MAST, a mature development team, historical precedence (a claim to the identity), and a safer development track record. 
Both coins will struggle with decentralization of hash power in the immediate future, in the end though BCH has no more utility than LTC, with way more issues to make it an attractive investment or day to day currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:40:20
Flip to BCH, what color is that kool aid?
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:00:40
According to fork.lol it's already 51% BTC
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:12:53
TIL you're a pussy
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:59:01
Agreed, make your money now and dump it while it's hot.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:41:33
Vibrant community? It's people shilling for Ver or Wu and shitting on BTC hoping it will fail.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:03:28
I needed the ELI5 for this, without a better technical understanding it feels much like an unnecessary hostile takeover.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:25:49
Something those rubes at should learn about before saying Segwit doesn't work. It's a mailability fix that opens up new possibilities. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:43:37
Scalability is a must I agree. I just don't think this is the way to go about it. It may not kill it, but will certainly make it walk with a limp for some time. :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:11:41
Didn't a single dev hard fork your shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:46:47
You mean Airdrop, or it would have 0 value. It's entire value is derived from riding Bitcoins dick.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:02:48
BCH literally is a shitty litecoin, with centralized mining trying to linear scale itself back to a new federal reserve
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:38:12
Linear scaling isnt scaling, it's a bandaid, youre gonna lose a lot of coin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:42:55
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:38:30
How much time really? If XT has a fix in place, how long would it really take the core devs to implement something similar. I have more of an issue in how it's played out and that it feels like a hostile takeover.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:40:07
Following the coins in that one transaction where pub and trans id send to the same address, do it appear to end up 1GQmweAj7Lqwzs4eD8u6DjGA8da2kaG93S ??

I feel for those putting BTC into BCH, going to get fleeced by a bunch of bad actors.
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:54:24
If i had a bit for everytime I heard..."not bitcoin again" I'd be rich.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:33:14
Personally I don't care what you wish or think, statement is still fact, BCash is not Bitcoin, no more than the 1000 other alts who've forked from it.
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:16:27
Just need CDN support now coinbase.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:11:19
Why couldn't we just wait, bitcoin would have to scale to survive, so it would happen as needed. Forcing a hostile takeover to XT just seems like a poor decision for the publics perception and confidence in bitcoin in general.
@_date: 2015-08-31 15:01:38
Really? Cause I've signed up and can't find an option to purchase from you. It says I have to complete set up, and when I do it redirects me to this 
I've verified phone and personal details
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:14:15
Same here, support the large block size, but XT is the purple kool aid that will kill us all.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:57:34
Exactly! Akin to some kid taking his ball and going home cause he's not getting his way. XT is bad for bitcoin in my opinion. I'd rather set up a core node in defiance of this ugly coup.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:05:50
Segwit isn't even being utilized to a large degree yet, how has it failed. Bitcoin qt has the capability yet its not part of the gui or in anyway user friendly, it's very early still ...linear scaling is not a solution.
@_date: 2015-07-21 14:45:55
I don't have much to suggest.Looks great and responsive on mobile. Clean design.

So what's your shitcoin friend, BCH? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 08:41:31
Only if you're looking for a way to toss your bitcoin down the shitter.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:00:34
Providing your customer base with another payment gateway option and adding an additional revenue stream makes perfect sense, and more so being the BTC volume transacted would be a small % to their regular payments processed.
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:48:29
No, it's economic freedom from a tyranical monetary system, not a solution to feed the poor and store coffe purchses on chain. You come on here looking to "learn", when in fact its more like you're playing dumb, or you really do lack the basic ability of critical reasoning
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:35:55
Can I have one?
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:06:01
Nice try, very sly my friend, but I'm not sharing ;) I have 3 of these made up for BTC and one for LTC too though.
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:24:09
Why not just hide them, or transfer to an unknow address, send to a trusted famiky friend to retain, claim it was a gift or lost or anything, give her the dog, not the coin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:24:04
The entire key, took a bit, but glad I did it.

Hey dude I dig it, but night mode was a bit too dark, consider running with something along these lines -  
I changed the bg and buttons to a more neutral color, and the bright red/green to a bitcoin orange and deeper green, and some small changes to font sizes and padding. 
and was thinking all grey svg icons for night mode for each crypto icon, but didn't go full on re-edit, but just a thought :)

Why not set up shop on Shopify to use as an inventory management system with the ability to track orders. It integrates with both coinbase and bitpay as a processor.

Because it's centralized controlled/trust-required and to date provenly mutable platform that has show it runs stoppable apps. Also lets not forget, it wasn't an attack. The contract executed as designed, it was bad code.

Dell.ca recently stopped , called customer support and was told 1/100 calls ask sales to be able to use Bitcoin. What I was told it was something to do with Canadian Law/regulation around people purchasing in bitcoin and shipping the product to other countries, how that's any different than fiat, no idea.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:01:22
Your analogy is inaccurate, it's more like "the attacker" sent a cheque to buy the Brooklyn Bridge, and someone wasn't smart enough to realize they shouldn't cash the cheque.
Vitalik has indeed called himself a benevolent dictator in the past. He is the single point of failure and the fork was to protect investments.
