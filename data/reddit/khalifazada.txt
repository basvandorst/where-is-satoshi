I don't think u do...coz thats 8977 USD

buddy...we're all desperately waiting for the recession to finally hit, for the markets to finally tank. For everybody who is anybody to sell their mother and buys BTC.

Its a BTM in a convenience store...but I'm assuming they are quoting live prices.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:15:39
itll be funny, eye-opening and mouth-watering attractive if come October Bitcoin would be below 8k.
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:44:58
thank you!

yeah those are very solid points. I think miners will just abandon the network at some point.
The above resource suggests that price doesnt asymptotically goes to 1, I was very wrong assuming that. More like price oscillates around 1.0 as the cost of mining increases.
Also halving doubles the mining cost instantaneously.

Yes you can. By implementing another layer. LN is already operating at sub-satoshi levels.

planning to do just that only not $5.7k - $6.0k range but $6.0k - $6.4k! All the way down to $5.3k and then buying the farm back.

Well I disagree TBH. My vision of BTC is different in the sense that my approach to analysis is more technical in nature. If we were to talk about fundamentals the fact that Venezuela is experiencing high demand, Kazakhstan is at ATH with volume, China is back into the game (and so much more cryptos overall are going through) these are all factors that are at the root of the upward dynamics that the price has been experiencing. Yes.
But what about where BTC is going to end up 1 day, 1 week and 1 month from now? Locally and temporarily prices easily get overbought and oversold. Reversion back to the mean which is the behavior the price exhibits is all about that.
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:54:23
how exactly are you accepting bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:34:39
Use whatever method makes you profit my friend! i stand behind my "cup" candlestick pattern analysis. So far I havent seen evidence to the contrary. If it's not obvious to you that $6.0-6.4k is a major resistance area then you need to go make a stronger tea with those leaves

Multinational banks have fiduciary obligations and are obliged to act in diligent manner. They will be severely fined otherwise. They cannot throw around trillions and they certainly cannot manipulate the markets so openly. If you were a giant bank you would have a regulator with a microscope looking into every as\*hole that works for you for possible ethical violations, negligence and etc. So I hardly doubt you would be able to do anything.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:38:14
True. I fully agree. I easily see all of us having secure hardware wallets as standard on smartphones within the next 3 phone cycles. Adoption will skyrocket.
EDIT: So will BTC
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:56:50
And yes as the saying goes "buy on the rumor, sell on the news"
So if you found yourself buying BTC when its "popping all over the news" you're late to the game.

I think we have one more week of upside movement to go. Slowdown will start at $6k and \~$6.3k will start reversing (aka correcting/reverting back to the mean). My bet is on BTC drawing a "cup" pattern and this is the last segment of the body. Reversal from $6k -&gt; $5k -&gt; $6k will draw the "handle" portion of the pattern.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:25:13
You're saying this as if its a bad thing. Of course the price has to re-trace and correct at some point. Nothing goes only one way. We should all take advantage of that. I see more potential to the upside. To $6k and reversal from there.

What did u use for rendering? Is this Max's default engine? Scanline?��
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:44:45
You dont need to follow my advice, in fact I'm just expressing my analysis without any implications. I try to be as objective as I can. I do not suggest shorting BTC at all. At 6k BTC is NOT going to go parabolic. It will be severely overbought (temporarily) at that price point due to the recent breakout at $4.1k. It's also blatantly obvious 6k will be a major resistance point as it paves the way for BTC to get to $10k.

I hope not only enough for internal but so many of these BTMs are built that they are exported to Venezuela, Argentina and the rest of the world to facilitate a faster transition to digital currency.
This puts a very bullish pressure on BTC price.
@_date: 2019-04-15 01:02:31
BTC will continue to rise for a very long time, folks. So buy and hold! In fact buy and buy. 
Once we get off the USD as reserve currency cryptos will start to shine. Once global sh*t (debt) crisis hits the fan cryptos will start to shine.
I guess I'd speak for a lot of people when I say that we'd all like to see a future where cryptos take center stage.
A future where a printed bill would be analogous to Monopoly money. Ok maybe not Monopoly money but "redeemable for store credit" money.
So let's collectively make this self-fulfilling prophecy happen!
And the best thing YOU can do to make it happen, to make a contribution is to go out there and buy some BTC for yourself!
&lt;insert "Did You Buy Some BTC Today?" poster&gt;
Think of this,
Digital money is the future without a doubt! Technology has intruded into every aspect of our lives and money as a tool, as a medium of exchange and store of value is no different.
Now the notion of value I find is very dubious. Value is so relative to perspective how can we ever agree on anything but let's put that aside for now. Digital money. So why not just Visas and PayPals? In a word: decentralization! ��
You own your own money. Keep your digital keys on your Dropbox, or your �� (ledger), or atomic wallet and memorize 12/24 word seeds.

too bad u think that coz BTC is _de facto_ The Index for all cryptos. Future for BTC as a settlement instrument (lightning network) and as a store of value (as price still has plenty of leg room) also looks promising.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:17:50
yes through 3rd party, but u can live off of crypto
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:06:26


As in the bullish trend will continue for a long time.
@_date: 2019-05-03 13:36:09
did u just buy 1 BTC or are you trading and made it as profit?
@_date: 2019-05-07 18:48:52
BTC is a great buy at all levels. Buy and hold. And then buy some more.
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:51:25
well global derivatives market cap is around $40-50 Tr....so BTC has room to go way beyond $500,000.00 price tag :D
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:18:07
Do the simple math, folks!
17.7M (circulating supply) x $500,000.00 = $8.85 Trillion marketcap. If you believe marketcap of this size is possible then the price indeed can reach these levels.
\- FX daily circulating [supply]( \~$5.1Tr
\- [Gold market cap]( \~$7.5Tr
\-  [Bitcoin Volatility]( is on average 46.96% annualized so it will get there in (ln(500k) - ln(7800)) / ln(1.4696) = 10.82 years.
