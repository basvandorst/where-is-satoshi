You forget that coinbase has about half the "bitcoin users" what with being the easiest way into bitcoin. And it's recent fad, I don't find it surprising that they network dropped like it did... so many new investors trying to make a profit, when thatsbnit what bitcoin is about

Thanks for giving us your key

That's too many zeros sir. Maximum of 8 decimals. We don't care about shit-toshis

And if you do, then you should use their vault function, where you have 24 hours to confirm the transaction

My friend and I have a business together and we both use the same coinage account, in order for us to do it we had to verify our identities again. But it still worked
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:36:33
No, I was just letting you know that 2 different people  with completely different last names can be on the same coinbase account. However if he is doing this then it's likely he used someone sales bank account and identity.  So your dealing with a pro

Pokemon go was  a huge success because of itstv series and cards that were a solid 25 or more years ago. I dont think it should count as 19 days
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:37:32
Okay, so we disagree. That's fine. There's no point in taking this any further.  Good day sir/ma'am.

Hmm, interesting. Well I suppose there's always an exception. Is it a tall barn?
@_date: 2018-07-20 18:33:43
Sure it is. To be the most Northern mode in NA. that's reason enough

What the fuck happened to your clock? Or is that a radio? On the desk to the right.

If everyone in the town had an increase in power price then the power company saw a population that was using a larger amount of power than expected and changed the starting price. My power company has set tiers. So shit like this doesnt happen. If you use under a set amount of wattage per month you fall under the basic tier and your price increases as you go into the next tiers. Ergo my company isn't a greedy fuck like whomever was the supplier for that town.

Please dont forget to wipe them every few months with an appropriate dust removal tool. Any dust accumulation will inhibit proper transfer of energy. And any scratches you make removing the dust improperly will also decrease the efficiency of energy transfer. I hope you already know this but it would suck if you did t and no one told you.
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:22:28
I dont see how though. Doesnt everyone pay for their own electricity? That's just the power company getting greedy.
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:26:15
Exactly so its the power companies fault. They turned into greedy assholes. If they wanted to blame someone it shouldn't have been the miners.

There is satellite internet. And solar power my friend.
