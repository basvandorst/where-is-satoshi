Just a quick note this doesn't work for all WordPress users, it does not work for blogs hosted on WordPress.com as plugins are not allowed. It only works on self hosted WordPress.org blogs.

Awesome, thanks for the reply, thats exactly how much i was thinking of putting in hehe. I am in Australia so don't think i can use Coinbase. However i can buy BTC within the hour by handing cash to any bank branch, so thats pretty easy. I might look into setting up a verified account linked to my bank account so that i can reduce the amount of steps it takes me.

Thanks! this is exactly what i was looking for.

I didnt code my wallet, but i did check the hash of electrum before installing it, and i feel its safe for me to reasonably assume trust through enough people having checked the code. Its a very well known wallet used by many people and audited by many. 
In comparison to trusting some person on the internet posting a link to with a link to a linux distro with a wallet built in. 
Theres a massive difference of trust there, as i said its about being vigilant. I don't get what your trying to point out?
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:19:28
Electrum is a software hd wallet (my trezor also is)
@_date: 2014-06-12 10:54:07
Thanks for the reply, but i couldnt see where i enter my existing electrum details in?

i thought they were getting our addresses by looking at the blockchain?
They dont need to find addresses on the net to do this
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:08:24
Mission success right? You mean pass it onto silk road. Your post history doesnt match up with your story bud
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:55:51
I tried it a few times.
Your telling me, that on an offline machine, with just your seed, it will generate the same addresses over and over shown in the client (albeit with zero balance because it hasnt synced online)? 
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:08:57
It's because we all agreed that these solved maths equations are valuable. Just like saying, a piece of gold is valuable.
Except this is not a tangible object.
At the start these maths equations were sold for very cheap because no one really believed in them, but then over the last few years it grew more and more until where we are at today with lots of 'bitcoin money' in circulation.
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:13:42
I think you miss my point, i simply am saying to be aware of the extra layers of risk in using a wallet prebuilt inside an OS like this. 
Do you research, find out yourself if the company is trustworthy. Dont take (your) word for it.
I wasnt implying that Trisquel isnt safe, because to be honest i hadnt bothered to look. Which doesnt negate my fact, as researching the company is the first thing i would have done had i decided i needed to use such a product.
@_date: 2014-08-14 09:43:30
signed firmware updates do not wipe the device
Also when recovering from seed you enter extra words that arent part of your seed to trick any key logger.

Thanks for the heads up dude!
I managed to also score my name  Winner!
And in return i shall give my first tip :)
100 bits It will be interesting to look back at this post in a few years when bitcoin is mainstream and you and me are living off the accidental tips we constantly receive from people because of our vanity urls haha :D
RemindMe! 2 years "Thank Kyle again, withdraw balance from changetip vanityurl and relocate to the newly formed Bitcoinia island with newfound riches"

Thanks, i tried what you said and it worked, so i tried mine again and its working now, i don't know where i went wrong before, but now i am happy with it and will be investing tomorow :)
Thanks so much for taking the time to help me out
@_date: 2014-12-12 09:57:33
I'd manually verify all the links in this post before followwing, as it would be easily to bait a link to a modified file and steal btcs!
Not saying its done, just be vigilant.
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:07:51
Yet 10 months ago you were posting on the silk road subreddit and 9 months ago you were asking for free vertcoins.
Also posting about opiates
Your story doesnt add up! 
-update- aaaand those posts are deleted. 100% guaranteed scam.
@_date: 2014-09-30 14:45:54
Yeah we have been doing this in australia for quite a while, its been working really well
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:55:36
I do understand, to be fair. just looking out for the noobies. Its common to link wallets here in a bait n switch. Something like this is a obvious offering that im sure has been used to try and steal wallets before, if not it will be at some point in the future. 
Regardless of who it says its from, you need to be wary of the risks you are taking by adding additional layers between you and your money and how to avoid them. It doesnt really relate to electrum being hard baked or trisquel not directly being a company.

Here is exactly what you are looking for, op
Lets you build structured selling plans according to how much you have invested and whether you prefer short term returns or long term
@_date: 2014-11-05 04:53:04
Trust and bitcoin don't go well together. When will people learn? :D
It's all about being safe. It pays to be vigilant (pun not intended). Not implying these guys are dodgy, it's more so about building good practice.
Just be wary, make sure the wallet software you are running is not modified, A modified wallet could easily wait until it had enough users private keys in use before swiping it all at once.
@_date: 2014-11-04 11:37:59
Haha, woah. My mind just got blown a little... it may be because im high but seriously dude woah.. its you! hi!
@_date: 2014-12-28 16:45:33
The coins are divisible to 8 decimal places, so we aren't going to run out of 'units' either..
@_date: 2014-11-05 11:06:13
Ah interesting! Thanks for answering my question. 
In regards to my original post though I think your argument is sort of missing the point. I was simply suggesting people be wary of this additional layer of trust.
What you can do in this situation is to verify that the wallet executable your using hasn't been tampered with. Thus removing that particular additional layer of trust. 
However.. I personally wouldn't use this even if I did verify the wallet software wasn't tampered with because it's possible there is a bundled virus or something with the OS itself. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 11:58:53
Thought about this but it requires custom software (bippy) which I'm worried won't always be available for me to decrypt as its not used widely
@_date: 2014-06-11 17:15:13
Just want something better then paper to store my own copy of my seed and to look nice and support a local =) 
@_date: 2014-11-27 22:14:45
Or you could use a different password on Both and also have 2 separate hd keys =) what if the person trying to beat it out of you knows you have a password? In that case your screwed 
@_date: 2014-11-12 08:00:50
Be wary of anyone offering wallet software from another source.
It could be modified to generate certain keys over time which then get swept up at a later date.

I myself recently won a world cup btc competition on a gambling site (luckybit), I won 1.8 btc for guessing Germany before the world cup began and gambling a bit through the site, overall gains 2.2btc (I mainly did low risk gambles just to increase my throughput = cut of 5btc prize) 
@_date: 2014-12-28 08:10:14
I understand how the multisig part works, but i was referencing bitfast:
"Use already initialized Trezor with a new GreenAddress login:
Go to sign up, in the right corner of the mnemonic passphrase there's a button to use the seed from the device instead."
Maybe i think what happens is it uses the ID that allows it to give the HD view-only key?
@_date: 2014-11-04 11:24:03
Calling this fake until i see evidence, nothing found through extensive googling or throughout this post. It just read like it had to be a troll

How can i be sure that your internal random number generator is truly random? 
How could a tool like linked check that a number is truly random, im confused! I must be missing something here.
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:22:00
Why did you go back and delete any reference to what i was talking about?
You were discussing why promethazine-codeine syrup never seems to appear on silk road 8 months ago, and you were also getting alt coin tips, Why would you delete that?
"as i mentioned my friensd told me about bitcoin, gawsh i already mentioned that!" - What on earth are you replying to?
Nobody tip this guy, he just wants free drugs.
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:53:48
I tried it again and it said because im in offline mode there may be more addresses then listed, it displayed completely different addresses + different MPK, so i went ahead and restored that different MPK on my online computer, it displayed the new 'different addrseses'. So i proceeded to sync online and the addresses changed to the original ones.
So confused.
@_date: 2014-11-02 06:45:17
sorry i thought you were writing the actual seed on your phone as a notification to make you remember it
@_date: 2014-05-25 08:07:49
Thanks, but as i said i'm not interested in making transactions, and i will most certainly be keeping the seed safe
@_date: 2014-12-18 08:16:30
Get a HD wallet and memorize the words, that way you can store a billion in your head :)
@_date: 2014-12-28 11:45:58
Ah cool, thought so. Just like the trezor lite app for android, to gain access to your HD list of used/unused addresses without giving the ability to create keys. 
Looking forward to adding greenaddress multisig to my trezor setup.
I wonder how it will work in regard to multisig, will i need to transfer my funds to a new address to enable the multisig functionality?
@_date: 2014-11-18 11:41:48
I think this will be great to reference when people scream ponzi at bitcoin rather then trying to explain the technical differences.
@_date: 2014-12-28 05:49:05
So if using green address+trezor for multisig, i realise you will have one sig on the trezor, one sig on GA, but if GA goes down what do you do then?
@_date: 2014-12-24 14:46:06
I see it happening by people seeing companies like microsoft accept it, and also your going to be hearing alot about bitcoin services from the startups that were invested in this year, next year.
 I anticipate another rally which will get the news going again and this time it wont be tainted with just drug money as it will clearly have lots of other uses to the public.
I think it will just happen naturally.
@_date: 2014-12-28 05:46:20
how does greenaddress get the seed from device? I thought the device cannot transmit the seed?
@_date: 2014-12-28 16:51:10
I thought that greenaddress and trezor use the same wordlist/bip protocol for HD wallets? I'm trying to understand how you can have the same seed for both, but them both show a different HD set of addresses?
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:30:06
You came on here implying that your such a good person that when you got tipped you gave it all out because you felt this urge to. People then tipped you, i come in thinking here we go again and decide to check your post history, which contradicts your post and then you go and delete them.
close to a year ago you were giving out a wallet address asking for free vertcoin. That was one your first post on this account, now u went and deleted it why?
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:00:26
Be wary of anyone offering wallet software from another source.

I don't know anything about this distro in particular but my statement stands true for anything, it only takes one bad apple to ruin it. (look what happened with that other linux distro recently that had satoshidice etc blocked).
@_date: 2014-11-05 12:49:18
This is what i will be using when electrum 2.0 is out of beta! :D got my trezor hooked up to mytrezor atm
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:10:05
Thanks for the replies guys, from the research i've done i'm thinking of going livecd linux + electrum + linux encrypted FS thumbdrive storing my wallet/master key, with the 12 word seed written down in a couple of places. 
I think that should do the job :)
@_date: 2014-06-14 06:31:15


It has happened..

This disgusts me :( How can they just take away his stuff like that...
@_date: 2014-12-28 12:00:23
Gotcha, changing my existing trezor setup from mytrezor will require a new seed to use greenaddress multisig with it.
Makes sense.
Thanks for your help
@_date: 2014-10-12 09:18:37
Welcome home! 
@_date: 2014-11-12 10:04:19
I doubt the distro creators would do it themselves, but it is a possibility that somehow something gets in the way, your adding additional layers of trust using a prepackaged product like this.
Using this iso blindly means:
Trusting someone you probobly dont know to not steal your money.
Trusting the iso hasnt been tampered with since the devs touched it. (make sure you check the hash of the iso).
It's also possible that a rogue dev or someone might have snuck something in that the rest of the team didnt agree with (like what happened with satoshidice etc being blocked in gentoo) or that they didnt notice (perhaps naughty RNG or something)
Just stay wary, be vigilant. Even when you feel safe. Additional layers of trust in the bitcoin world generally don't work out in the end.
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:47:43
Hiya, thanks i understand. I have installed and tested this but i have one question.
I tested creating a seed, then exporting the mpk to my online machine, then i deleted the wallet on the offline machine and regenerated using seed, but it gave a different MPK. 
So i guess, lets say my online machine got wiped, i no longer have my MPK, and i restore from seed on the offline machine. How would i get my offline machine ledger up to date without connecting it to to the net to sync? 
Because the way i see it now, the only way to spend money would be to sync the balances from the online machine (from the one time generated MPK) onto a flash drive, copy onto the offline machine, import the balance, then sign a transaction and bring it back across.
I know im missing something here.
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:33:42
Your not going to find a match (realistically) and this is just going to slow down blockchain.info.. At least take down the code so you cant DDOS blockchain with people who think they have a chance at getting some bitcoin from this.....

Thanks, just donated :)
@_date: 2014-07-15 09:45:52
I sincerely hope you dont plan on handing these out to just anyone.
If my mum or dad got handed that, i think it would put them off bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:00:32
This is what i did, worked well, most accepted. I sent them to greenaddress
@_date: 2014-08-19 08:56:37
If you really want to get rid of them, i'll gladly take them from you and put them to good use. Me and my mum have lyme disease ive been on treatment for about 18 months and am about 80% better but mum is in hospital on suicide watch just starting treatment now (and treatment makes symptoms worse), We could really use that money to put towards our health.
Thanks for taking the time to read :)
@_date: 2014-11-05 08:23:29
How can you be no safer if you verify every line of code against the known safe version?
I dont understand your argument...
Unless you mean that the actual distro itself could have some dodgy means of influencing private key generation, then fair enough. I don't know if this is possible but if it is, then you should avoid all distros with built in wallets.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:23:46
Hey, i didnt even think of that. But if i do need access to the funds in an emergency, it would be nice to be able to. I think the incentive of not swiping due to exposing the private key thus wasting my $60US for bitkee metal paper wallet is enough to prevent me from using it when i shouldnt
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:29:26
I have the tails drive imaged/encrypted and put on the cloud, so i wont lose anything at the moment (i do this for various reasons), but forgetting that, the password is set, its a 25 character key i wont remember saved in a keepassx file, i can write it down in several locations, remember i will have the bitkee itself also.
I think writing down the password in several offline secure locations, and keeping the bip38 protected address in my peristant tails volume should be enough. I won't forget the password to tails. And if i did due to a head trauma i could get to my bitkee. I will write all instructions for relatives in case of unfortunate circumastances.
What do you think?
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:31:01
This is true, but then i need to add trust to the factor, also, i have already paid the $60 US for the bitkee itself. I see your advantage in that i could set verbal rules to not let me spend the money. Thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:17:07
I have a trezor, i want something that im incentivized to not sweep.
Would you suggest that i write down the key in a few secure places including offsite and then just leave it at that? as i have orderd the bitkee with the pub/bip38 key for $38US + $20US shipping and want to use it as my long term savings.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:21:52
Good suggestions, i think i might take this process. My reason for using a single key is this is specifically my long term vault that i want to be incentivized not to sweep. (as obviously the private key will be exposed to the internet possibly).
I have 2 HD wallets that i use with labels for 2 seperate bitcoin projects i have running, i have those backed up on seed works as you do
@_date: 2015-07-23 05:30:15
This is true, but the odds are pretty small of something coming of it, i think u know that by the smiley face :) the password will be hidden well and far.
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:50:15
I've put up with utorrent since its glory days, unticking those bundled crap and just using it.
But this... this is absolutely the straw that broke the camels back. I will never use utorrent again and will actively advocate replacing it.
I'm downloading Deluge now, seems like a good reccomendation from what i've read. Keen to see what it offers, from the look on the website, quite alot!
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:01:19
Upset that the Trezor guys pointed out the backdoors that bwallet had sneakily inserted into its code?
