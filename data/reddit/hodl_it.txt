Thanks for the mention.
Walletsniffer sends notification email when a new incoming transaction appears in the address. No confirmations needed and only one notification will be sent out.
 The delay you are facing could be from the email service provider or it could be something wrong with the email client App syncing time. I can confirm that I usually receive notifications instantly in my Gmail account.

I am not much into iOS App development. What you need is Blocktrail API. Let me know if you need any help with that.

The 17.5K can give nightmares for a couple of days.
In my opinion, The only thing stopping Bitcoin from growing is the Network congestion. With lightning network implementation everything will be butter smooth. 
The more useful it is the more value it will have and the more value it has the more people get into it so we will see a heavy increase in price.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:41:36
Some people don't like new.
Watch the movie Croods :D 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:37:28
BCash? That scam, centralized coin? lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:30:13
BitPay? lol

What are you trying to say?
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:34:11
Okay boss :D
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:47:22
Yep, You might have read that but you probably understood that in a very different way or whatever is written in the book could be wrong.
Here is a tiny video to explain it in a better way : 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:44:26
I have heard a lot of complaints about them my friend. I don't know what exactly is going on but I never had any issues with them. That's what I meant to say. 
I don't know anything about the company or the people behind it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:56:19
See, Not even banks like Coinbase. :D
Use Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:35:00
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:43:06
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:15:12
I gave it 1 star because of your shitty comment.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:36:02
You are paid to support coinbase, aren't you?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:07:41
You only feel the dips after you get in. 
Watching dips from the outside don't feel much.. :)
btw, I got in at 480. Haven't sold any since then.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:09:51
Come on.. I never said it's a crash. Why you keep saying crash.. crash.. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:40:37
If it works, Don't fix it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:33:11
Why would anyone sell an appreciating asset??
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:09:17
lol ShitiBank
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:47:13
Scam Coins like BCH don't come with cool technology like SegWit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:06:49
The reason why Tulip Bulb mania burst was because people realized that they can grow it's own their own (No supply cap). 
Bitcoin has a Supply cap and nobody can create a single more Bitcoin above that limit.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:40:48
I don't think so.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:31:22
Of course, many people buy it because it keeps going up but everything that goes up isn't a Bubble my friend. It could be a Rocket or a Space Ship :D
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:59:43
There is another one coming soon..

@_date: 2017-12-08 19:44:39
Trust me, It's on the way.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:42:07
I bought most of my coins at $500. I never sold any and I have no plans to sell anytime soon.
If you purchased at 19,500 and it's giving you a nightmare simply sell it off so I can buy more :D
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:19:04
Sent :D Might take a while to confirm though.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:47:30
Oh boy, Is that same as Bitcoin?
Okay fine, Imagine I own a Ferrari 250 GTO 1962. If there are only 2 of these, it is in mint condition and it's from a premium brand, the price of the car I own will go up like crazy with time.
There are thousands of other car makers and they may come up with new, faster, better cars every year. All these machines help you travel from A to B right? So is it same as my Ferrari? Never. None of these cars will be enough to kill the value of my Ferrari.
Bitcoin is Bitcoin, Something so special created by a special mysterious Man. It will always be premium. Buying some Altcoin and thinking it's same as Bitcoin is stupid... it's not.
Note: 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO was auctioned for $38 Million in 2014.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:45:28
it is dead :D
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:14:37

I remember watching this video last year.

Doesn't matter if it works :D
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:33:11
Give me your Wallet address friend. I will send you some. :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:45:32
I do.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:40:55
BCash? lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:39:44
huh, Yes, Sir :/
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:59:19
I never said Crash.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:39:48
You don't know what Tulip Mania is, Do you?
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:41:18
You could transfer for Free using IOTA.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:38:26
Why would I buy? They are paying me every day in Bitcoin only. I simply transfer that to my Trezor and Hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:00:41
Whatup new dude? :D
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:58:19
I usually buy around 150-200USD worth every day and I hold over 2 Million worth in coins. This is not the only asset I hodl so it doesn't matter to me but I know Bitcoin price is about to go Moon super soon :) 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:47:56

@_date: 2017-12-20 09:48:25
Bcash is already dead :D
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:55:55
Already following SegWit only policy.
using Trezor, Ledger, and GreenAddress.
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:43:59
A bubble should pop completely and go to nothing Mr. "toddler". Bitcoin didn't.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:48:38
BCH is shit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:56:08
I don't know man.. I haven't missed a payment from Genesis since 2016 December. 
My only regret is that I bought the contract using Bitcoins. 
I spent 16K to buy the contract at that time and I received over 95K so far. It would have been a good deal if I had purchased using Fiat money.
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:17:01
Any similar experience?
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:06:17
lol True, but I actually meant Blockchain based.
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:18:31
I can't.
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:42:36
Worst prime minister ever.
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:22:07
Haha.. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:41:06
Yesterday, I had a talk with Branch Manager, Regional Manager, Assistant Manager, General Manager and Grieveance dept after I received an email from them saying that the purpose of remittance is invalid.
I know some of these people personally. They have promised me that they will do everything they can to credit the funds by Monday EOD.
Waiting hopefully now.
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:49:01
Okay.. :)
For now, The websites which provide the lending services are the Middle man in Crypto Lending world.
Thinking... 
If having a middle man is a problem, A decentralized lending platform probably can be built on Blockchain where each user will have a credit score like system and can receive loans based only on the score.
I wish that happens :D
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:22:54
Oh lol.. sorry, I thought it's a new comment and you are asking about how I would receive any interest on the hold period.
Answer to your question would be, There are Bitcoin lending websites and communities out there. You will need to KYC and Prove that you can return the funds to receive Money. Works just like how you would take out a loan from a Bank.
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:54:46
That's interesting.
I have sent many emails so far and I have received no positive response from you yet. No plans to send more emails and wait to hear another stupid reason from you for not crediting the funds in my account.
I know what to do. 
Branch Manager promised me that he will figure out a way to credit the funds by Monday EOD. If that don't happen, I will close down all my accounts and I will make sure no other ICICI NRI customer from UAE face this sorta problem ever again.
Thanks for Responding though.
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:57:10
Exchanges too should be Decentralized.
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:03:47
Not true. There will be Bitcoin loan providers.
@_date: 2018-05-15 02:50:37
I agree
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:18:31
Comeon! There are Banks in India providing over 27% in 3 Years.

@_date: 2018-05-12 09:28:42
I Agree.
ICICI Responded to me in post comments an hour ago. Glad to know that my Reddit post worked as expected.
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:01:23
Public sector is worse than this..
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:21:13
I think I like the last option :)
Thanks for your support bro.
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:41:07
10% offered is for 3 Year tenure.

We pronounce it like : Ichichi (means something gross in Malayalam).. lol
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:17:06
Why Roger Ver exists?
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:37:59
FIAT lending is shit investment anyways.
I earn about 7% in interest annually from my Fixed Deposits. 7% Tax Free. And the currency inflation rate in India sometimes reaches 11% (2013).
So, I make 7% in interest but I lose 11% in total valuation. That would be like 4% loss every year.
Ps: I am taxed nowhere because I am an NRI and living in Dubai. That's why 7%. Resident Indians receive only about 4%.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:29:17
In the logo on the official website it is "bitcoin" not Bitcoin. Still they made great achievements. Not trying to prove anything, Just saying. :)

There is no way to adjust fees in Coinbase. I wonder why.. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:03:28
Tips? Yeah.. 
Buy and move Coins to a safe wallet. Never ever leave it in an Exchange. NEVERRR...
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:30:42
Blockchain too.
Coinbase sucks anyways.. I know :)
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:38:04
Wrong. It's supposed to be faster than traditional payment methods.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:20:13
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:00:00
I bet a Bitcoin right now is going to be the best investment you would ever make in your entire life.

Ah, makes sense.

@_date: 2017-08-22 15:03:39
How can I use a credit card to show someone how Bitcoin works :/
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:13:35

Not even a Satoshi.
I am still in profit. Why would I sell any..
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:33:16
Definitely. 
I have already helped a lot of people in Dubai to learn about Crypto currencies. I will keep doing it and maybe create a youtube video series or blog to help people while working on my own Mineable Blockchain Currency. :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:34:38
No. Only 70% of my portfolio is BitCoin. Rest are ETH, LTC etc
@_date: 2018-10-29 15:34:44
Moon? I don't know :) I still hold because it's a perfect medium of transaction for my businesses and I can save a shit load of money on Tax.
6K looks like a strong bottom price for the market right now. Price could shoot up faster than we think If BAKKT or ETF works the way we want or some other positive news come up.
I would say, $50,000 is an easy to achieve target in a couple of years. More than enough for me.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:51:07
Well, you are not a genius then bro :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:44:06
It's a Tax free country :D That's why.. 
For now there is no income tax, There is no sales tax, no VAT, no GST, no service tax nothing.
In UAE, Tax is only applicable to Banks, Petroleum and Oil companies.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:32:36
I have some friends who buy a lot of Bitcoins for trading purposes and also I sell and Buy via Localbitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:42:43
That's not how economic system works but I wish the same..
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:41:44
The fees bro.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:33:06
That's actually a prepaid debit card ;)
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:55:52
Why would anyone lie about it in Reddit? I don't see any benefit.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:45:34
:D lol
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:49:33
Yes, I was a millionaire even before I started buying BitCoins. I trade Stocks and Forex a lot and was into Sports Betting so Yes, I guess I have decent risk tolerence. :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:30:15
There is no Tax in Dubai my dear :)

Can't wait anymore for SegWit activation and Lightning Network.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:40:12
I don't sell off an appreciating asset. I believe in Bitcoin and so I will hodl.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:45:01
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:42:18
No. Money doesn't make money if you don't know how to use it properly. Making money isn't the hard part, the hard part is learning how to use it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:55:18

As long as a currency has a purpose, it has potential to grow. I prefer ETH over LTC but both are fantastic and I hold almost equal amount of both.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:38:00
Already answered that in the comments
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:22:48
:) I wish so
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:30:52
So that you can buy cheap? �� I will never.. 
I trade only 10% of my portfolio. I have no plans to sell more than that at anytime near in future. 
The plan is to buy more if the price drop to $2500. ����
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:50:56
I am pretty sure that I will not have to PM you if it's good enough. :)
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:37:41
to SegWit address? Yes..
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:19:14
Because I was explaining to my friend how bitcoin transactions are done.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:28:20
You are smart :)
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:40:39
I gotta try that :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:31:51
Na, I was simply showing a friend how the transactions are made using Bitcoin. At that time I didn't realize that I spent $3.5 in fees. That's what happened.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:35:53
I would eat shit than selling out :D
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:27:00
I didn't purchase it all at once so I am not sure about the exact amount I spent but it should be around 175K USD.
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:30:20
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:42:48
Last year. Started buying, hodling and trading since 580ish.
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:36:14
Why would anyone sell a solid and swift appreciating asset. :) 
btw, I use a card from BitPay for small purchases using BitCoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:29:53
Lightning will
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:29:09
How can I use PayPal to show how bitcoin works. :)
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:45:09
Around 175K USD. I had answered this before in comments
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:13:29
Why not bro. txn: 3f42bbd568132836b45b0779828bc6aa3808bf825c4237a4577302499b99447c
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:52:46
No bro. Electricity costs are heavy and so less profitable to mine in DXB. I believe India can be a better playground than DXB in mining.
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:01:07
It should. :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:38:05
Thanks amigo :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:04:23
Started Buying, Hodling and Trading since the price was $580ish..
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:40:51
Kidding :) I will sell only if I feel like there is no more potential for this to grow. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:02:08
Is it :D
Try wire transfer then.. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:48:33
lol.. When the right time comes.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:53:52
Right. 186.7 exactly :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:13:29
It's a Crypto world amigo and I write codes for Blockchains. I know how to promote stuff staying anonymous. ������ Love &lt;3
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:41:49
I didn't tell them that actually :) 
The guy wanted to know how transactions are made. Unfortunately I had only my Coinbase wallet with me at that time so used it to show a demo.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:02:01
May I know why? :) Curious...
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:44:21
Thank you! Keep Hodling.. :)
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:44:03
Yeah, Spend time learning to read people's sentiments and how that affect markets :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:19:36
BTC(~70%), ETH, LTC
and 10+ Other coins and Tokens.

@_date: 2017-08-31 16:09:27
Yep, 4 years. You been here since?
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:43:58
I will. The more the people know about it the richer everyone will be.

@_date: 2017-08-12 13:38:36
It gives hope to so many people.
It's the huge expectations people have what keeps the price bullish. :) If you know what I mean.
Target? Me? Do you know me? :D
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:08:51
I am an Indian and I can confirm this accurate.

Dong dong dong :D I was lucky.
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:01:44
Right now, You can easily transfer $10 for 1 cent in fee. 
I wouldn't even consider using any other payment option if my customers are familiar with Bitcoin or are people who can quickly figure out how to make a payment.
@_date: 2018-06-21 06:35:41
No SegWit address, No Support.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:57:53
I don't have such goals. I simply love BitCoin and so I hodl. It's fun watching the price go up. :)
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:24:28
Based on RBI, It's not illegal in India but shouldn't be used as a currency. There is no Ban on Purchasing or Hodling but Financial institutions and RBI controlled Banks are asked to stop supporting Crypto Exchanges.
Wait for the Supreme Court decision to know the future.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:07:15
Good find! Thank you!

1. You will make a good profit when the price goes up. Would the price go up? I believe it will... Why?
a. This crash was expected and I believe the price has hit the bottom already so it should go up soon.
b. This is a medium for financial institutions to make quick profit. They will buy in once the price is okayish and pump it up by spreading positive news just like in last November - January period.
2. Tax savings ;)
3. You don't have to report source to anyone.
4. You can easily transfer Huge Stash of money from your country to another without going through stupid bank processes.
and many more...

No. UAE has not much Oil reserves. Most of the funds come from Foreign Investments, Legal Fines (pressing an emergency button at metro without a reason will cost you 2K AED), Government services and Real Estate Tourism I believe.

It isn't going above 10K this year anyway ;)
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:47:14
Download only if you really need it 
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:31:13
Yep, I get it.
I needed a quicker way to check price and this is what I came up with :) It works and I am happy.. Will improve it if I decide to publish it someday in Chrome Store.
Thanks friend :)
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:14:35
Hmm. I found this website pretty useful.
Not sure why this post didn't get deserved upvotes. :/
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:03:38
This shit works every time. :D

According to earn.com, The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 52 satoshis/byte. Your transaction may take about 5-6 hours to receive a confirmation.
Also stop using CoPay/BitPay/Bitcoin.com wallets. They are all shit.

Coinbase is crap.
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:34:36
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:24:34
:) Questions are simple.. Answers could be tough.
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:42:28
What if Bitcoin is seen and and treated as a Commodity?
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:58:47
Try $1K using 2 cents fee.

@_date: 2017-10-14 18:53:26
Coinbase is literally shit
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:36:04
Doesn't mean it was going down always. Simply zoom out the charts and see.. It was always Bullish since inception.
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:55:01
Do you Hodl?
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:30:52
Or you can simply keep it as an asset.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:17:33
Yeet Yeet
@_date: 2018-07-02 13:32:11
Since when?
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:12:29
All that technical scaling issues you mentioned can be solved my friend.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:47:29
Some say what they see. Some say what they understand.

I am an Investor, not a Daytrader.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:29:22
You don't know what an asset is. Do you?
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:34:02
Damn, I read that the wrong way.. lol
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:34:48
Exactly what came to my mind when I saw the news. lol
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:16:33
In a previous post, I had mentioned that I have no plans to sell before it hit $45K.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:31:21
Holy craaaap!!! 
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:06:10
I usually purchase from local sellers around my area in Dubai and I hold almost 99% of my funds in Trezor (Hardware wallet) and the rest 1% in BitPay wallet for quick Bitcoin payments (Yes I hate them but the wallet is kinda cool)
I use coinbase the the price notifications only.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:37:48
You are a short term trader. Aren't you?
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:32:32
�� Why would you call him "Dude"?
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:15:32
I guess You are a short-term trader, not a long-term investor who believes in values.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:17:24
Bro, Why would you call me "Sir"?
@_date: 2018-07-07 15:55:24
BitPay? Really?
@_date: 2018-07-02 13:33:35
This is going nowhere but UPPPP... 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:31:46
It was never going down. You simply need to see it in a different perspective.
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:23:38
They still in business?
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:45:38
Memes can sometimes carry good message.
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:50:52
lol.. Don't get angry.
Spend time learning before fighting.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:43:28
Not true. We discussed about it when price was not doing well too. You weren't around then I guess.
@_date: 2018-07-04 06:45:38
You are right.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:01:52
You would understand it better than most of these guys who bought yesterday and sold today.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:40:03
That's a shitty strategy though.
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:41:37
So glad to see this.
I hope to deal with you guys in near future.
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:39:31
We will. You may want to panic..
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:01:10
I don't get you. When did I guarentee?
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:09:37
I don't think so.
@_date: 2018-04-13 07:57:03
@_date: 2018-04-08 09:51:32
Wassup bro :D
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:23:00
You should share The Bank Details so that we all can make sure to move deposits or funds.

Thicker the lines the stronger the effects : 
Blue lines: Support,
Yellow lines: Resistance,
Green line: EOY Target,
Cyan lines: Doesn't tell anything really.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:17:40
Oh Yeah..
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:17:14
I have been holding since the price was $400ish.. haven't sold much yet and have no plans to sell any till I hit my goal of 43K+.
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:17:54
I am no God. This is a prediction market. Nobody can guarantee which way it will move. Can you guarentee that price will move the opposite?
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:07:29
People will start trading directly for cash and start using p2p services like localbitcoins or bisq.
This is what going to happen.
@_date: 2018-04-08 08:25:12
More like a monster bull.
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:24:55
Yep, Motivating people to Hodl :)
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:12:35
Yes. $10K is very possible with this momentum.
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:45:10
Transaction batching and also Trend decline.
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:29:55
Hmm.. Actually, it's based on the previous bull run percentage :)
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:27:21
How do you know?
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:12:34
Heyyy, I posted it first! Come on..
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:13:01
Okay.. Now how would you say the same in a "Confident" way?
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:24:53
Depends on the use of the medium (Bitcoin) in real life and Greed.
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:13:41
No. That's called confidence. You lacks confidence.
