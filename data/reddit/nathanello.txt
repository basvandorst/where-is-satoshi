I just started my first philanthropic adventure to provide WordPress website development services at no charge for non-profit organizations. 1 BTC would really help push this mission a long way. I’ve got the domain lined up “Philanthro.Press” and would love your help getting this project going... You can see my personal background here &gt;&gt; 
I did one $30K charity project during 2017 for an organization called Defending The Blue Line which is a US 501c3 that helps provide military kids with all the equipment they need to stay in sports.
If you and my fellow Redditors believe in this mission please let me know, I’d love to talk to you more about this one!

Edit: Am setting up the proper donation page on the website now and will post it here once it’s ready.

None of them gain 30% in 30 days either... You could have the exact opposite story to tell right now too, maybe in 30 days you will, who knows?

I might not be the first to point this out but I sure hope this doesn't happen to you &gt;
