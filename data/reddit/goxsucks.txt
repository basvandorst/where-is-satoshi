The new management will need to have absolute integrity as well.

I agree it is contradictory.  In either case, the government has chosen to classify it in the way that bring the highest burden to the people.
I am ok with government regulate bitcoin as property as long as that means no money transmitter license is needed for bitcoin business.  
In my mind, bitcoin would be able to flourish a lot more without the burden of money transmitter license.

Besides altruistic motivation to help the community, may I also suggest that exchange is a very lucrative business.  It is conceivable that a well-run exchanges can make a lot of money.

This sounds really good.  :)  But may I ask a question?  How can we know this won't turn into a mafia-style extortion scheme later on.  ie. everyone has to pay some protection fee to be included in the "club" or else.  This is probably a bad analogy because it makes the idea sounds bad.  But it is a good idea.  I guess devil is in the detail.  I do not know patent laws either.

Good idea as any.  Thank.

Gox certainly lost a lot of goodwill of the community.  On the other hand, they are not lacking the name recognition, even though it is a negative one.  Some would say that even bad publicity is better than no publicity.  
Regulation is a big issue facing exchanges.  Gox does have a lot of verified accounts.

What does "label" and "message" means when we send bitcoin using bitcoin-qt software?
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:06:06
It is not the situation I want, but it is still better than losing the bitcoins in the account outright.  
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:37:49
Can we support a proposal to get MtGox to convert the account holder's bitcoin to shares?
It is not the ideal situation, but it is better than straight out losing the bitcoins in the account.

Several other people are suggesting some kind of community-run exchanges to replace Gox.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:13:23
Good point.  I do not know, but I thought we could at least give it a try.  Perhaps the person wants to help out the community.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:40:02
Yes, and both people have done a lot of community good.

Thank you.  I see.  So those data does not go into bitcoin transaction.  Is there a way to embed data in the bitcoin transaction?
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:17:31
Thanks for posting relevant info.
I guess the following is relevant info as well. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:11:25
Since it is account holder's money.  If it is already lost, might as well do it this way.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:22:07
Some new information from Bruce Fenton 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:48:42
Yes, they need to do the following at the very least:
1. totally transparent
2. implement the proof of reserve like the one Greg Maxwell proposed
3. auditing
