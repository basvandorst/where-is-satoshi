6% is still enough. But yeah, Cash could go well, but also can just become a boost for miners in time of big difficulty differences and the right profit.

A lot of people are expecting miracles! -.-
The only truth is, time will show what will happen next.
If anyone would know 100% how the market will react in the nex few days, will be the next "from penny to billionair" man...

The thing is, nobody is explaining what he means with bubble and what will happen when it pops.
Even when in a few years the price will be down to 10$ there will still be a lot of people making big money and others loosing it. IMHO the Bitcoin and a lit if other cryptos will stay houndrets of years...
