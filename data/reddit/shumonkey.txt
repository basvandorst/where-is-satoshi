That's the point.  He should be spending a set amount of fiat every week, so he buys more BTC at a lower price than he does at a higher price.

It's true that this happens all the time on BTC-E (and other exchanges as well), but I'm not convinced this is what happened yesterday on Gox.  If so, there's no way it was close to being profitable.  Isn't the trick to buy up coins on low volume to push the price up, let support build at that price, then start dumping?  On Gox coins were bought up to $200 above market price, then the dumping started immediately and just didn't stop, even after it was clearly no longer profitable to dump (sub $300).  I guess it's possible but seems incredibly poorly executed.

Or a third option: The price of bitcoin is supported primarily by speculators.

Rolls right off the tongue :-)

Pretty good indicator that bad news is going to come out from Gox imo.

The circle jerk is strong with this one.
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:19:09
OK, and I'm sure plenty of smart people said negative things about Betamax and zeppelins as well.  
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:19:27
Really sounds like all or almost all of btc on gox is definitely gone for good.  
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:19:48
Oh good, another post pointing out that the price has gone up in the past.  Thanks, I hadn't noticed that.
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:33:37
Lol, I give them points for trying.  Wish they would just call it bitcoinpyramid.com though.
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:58:21
Little early to start gloating, don't you think?  The price is still down over any time frame other than the last 24 hours or so (or last 6 months+).

I'm with you OP.  I think Bitcoin is great, but I'm worried about the implications if it were to fully take off.  I don't share the opinion of many on this subreddit that government is entirely an evil construction and that taxation is theft.  Sure, government does plenty that I disagree with, but I'm also happy that it provides a basic social safety net for the poor and elderly.  Some will argue that private charity would provide in the absence of government, or that the impoverished would pull themselves up by their bootstraps if they couldn't rely on the government for basic assistance, but it seems to me that this was not the case prior to the reforms of the New Deal and those that followed.
My mom is a public school teacher and my dad works for the federal government providing housing assistance to the homeless so perhaps that is part of it the reason I am not so anti-government as many here.  They are both good people who do good work, and our tax money pays their salaries.  For every corrupt politician and defense contractor CEO there are many more average government employees who are just trying to do something worthwhile with their lives and provide for their families.
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:28:53
A less loaded answer to this question would be that moving off the gold standard along with the creation of the federal reserve gave more power to the federal government to control the money supply.  The idea behind this is that this gives the government more tools to try to moderate recessions and temper periods of growth so they don't get out of hand.  While the wisdom or efficacy of these actions can certainly be debated, I don't think it was some grand scheme by bankers to steal wealth through inflation.

Bitcoin is not some sort of magic bullet that will lead to economic prosperity for all while curing cancer along the way.  
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:01:53
There is a difference between a "crash" and a gradual devaluation.  Yes, if bitcoin and fiat currencies both stick around then the value of bitcoin will continue to grow and the real value of fiat currencies will continue to decrease.  But that doesn't mean that fiat currencies are going to be worthless.

My contribution was "dumber than a box of Gox".  
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:40:26
If inflation is too high you incentivize people to put their savings into a currency which does not have high inflation.  It doesn't necessarily have to be deflationary though.  I don't know about "proving" this but for a pretty clear example see Zimbabwe.

BTC-E is down to 106 and falling...
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:37:27
They may be noobs, but you're definitely a prick.

Or until this person removes their bid.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:58:34
Now would be a great time to buy ;) (there's a crash/correction/whatever you want to call it happening right now)
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:58:31
Well my thoughts were to put USD into gox, buy BTC, transfer to BTC-E, trade to my hearts content, and if I want to get USD out, transfer the BTC back to gox and liquidate.  Seems like the best option unless I'm missing something.
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:24:27
I saw on a comment yesterday that it was 4000+.  Not sure if that was true or not.  I was verified a few weeks ago and it was 2000+ but that's old news.

From the sidebar: News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:10:20
Transaction fees are only .2% compared to .6% for Gox though.  I've been thinking about moving my coins over to BTC-E to buy/sell over there.  Any opinions?
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:12:30


It seems pretty likely to me that the vast majority of bitcoins are sitting wallets or in exchange accounts.  Where would they be invested?  AFAIK there are only a few minor sites for giving out loans... that's it.  And when the price rises nearly every day there's very little incentive to even provide a loan.  
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:04:55
Gold and bitcoin can obviously be a good hedge against inflation, but you could also buy TIPS, or invest in the stock market, or make a large purchase that you are saving up for.  I'm not really arguing for one action over another, but there are alternatives to investing in some alternate currency.  And to be honest, despite what some may say, inflation is quite low at the moment.  But I am a misguided Keynesian monetarist among a sea of Austrians here at :) 
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:41:24
I would just like to suggest that instead of downvoting this post if you disagree with it, respond with the reason why you disagree.  This subreddit is severely lacking in debate over the potential problems with bitcoin.  Especially with the influx of new readers, I think it's important to foster an atmosphere where people can have a rational, polite discussion.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:33:14
Of course no one can know what is going to happen.  But I would be very hesitant to buy in with that $100 barrier broken.  Especially considering the trajectory over the last week or so.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:56:32
The lag makes it fun!  Just kidding, this is obnoxious.

Not sure if this is the one you're talking about, but this is a pretty succinct explanation of the problem.  
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:14:21
Yeah except this didn't happen and the fed was never actually considering it.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:21:07
I don't think so.  As long as I don't cash out from BTC-E I won't lose any money.  I sell and buy BTC on BTC-E, and presuming I do this well, will have more BTC than I started with.  I then transfer them back to Mt Gox and sell at the higher price that Mt Gox offers.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:13:35
This is incorrect.  Deflation will continue forever, because the rate of production of coins will slow and eventually cease.  Even if everyone was using bitcoins it would still continue, as long as economic output continued to grow.

I use dwolla and Mt. Gox.  Now that everything is verified it takes about a day or two to transfer money from my bank -&gt; dwolla -&gt; mtgox.  But there was a long wait to get going now that both your dwolla and mtgox accounts need to be verified with photo ID.
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:58:33

If one bank goes under your money is safe. If all banks go under your money is still safe, but like the commenter above said it probably won't be worth much. At that point we've probably got bigger problems though.
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:50:38
I would say he's just being prudent.  He hasn't cashed out all his bitcoins.  It's perfectly possible to believe in bitcoin, but want to hedge against its possible demise.  Withdrawing 20% of your BTC to cover your initial investment while leaving 80% in the system come what may hardly strikes me as hypocritical.
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:15:00
Of course they do. They print the money.
