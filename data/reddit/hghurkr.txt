He says he can send .5 bitcoin instantly to his friend and he can spend it instantly. Block time is 10 minutes, so assuming high miner fee for both transactions the minimum is 10 minutes. 
10 minutes is not instant. 
Don't get me wrong, I love bitcoin, holding about 5 bitcoin for a long time now, but there is no need to over promise when there is so much else good about it

Yep, probably what happened. Exit node sniffing.

Z 10 is actually pretty nice. The hub and the keyboard make it very productive for me for work.

Just used it.
When sending bitcoin, it does nat give a transaction hash.
Only says recipient address and circles own reference id.
Would like transaction included.

This is really awesome. Nice job. Extrapolated, this could be a stock(color) market on blockchain, yeah?

Well, I assumed you had a ui to do it, just worried how random and secure the keys are as in the code that generates them

What I want to know is what is taking the nsa so long to implement cash scanners at every store and bank so they can track serial numbers of bills to identities and map flows.

The solution is merkle trees which have not been implemented yet but are laid out in the white paper. 
Everything is fine. Like many have said, 25gb is not too much in today's world.

the jury can't unhear it and surely will not sit through a reading of all this reasoning.

Bar scene seems like decentralized prostitution, really. Kik and snapchat is the blockchain, bars are exchanges, a steady is a cold wallet, two in the kitty is hot wallet.

The first place I used way before coinbase or circle was around. Worked fine. In a pinch, it helps too, to sell to PayPal as well for something on ebay or something.
