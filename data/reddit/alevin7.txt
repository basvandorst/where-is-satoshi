@_date: 2018-01-02 18:31:22
I sort of feel glad that people aren't so willing to jump in yet because i feel like you need to do some research into it before you invest, but i do like making money too.

Arent me already on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:39:31
Like what bitcoin is, why you would actually want it other than earning money. How it works, etc.  There has to be a reason why bitcoin is going to grow and you should want to at least know what it is before you put your money in it

Hey its dipping rn, that means budget bitcoins.   Also if you want to get a good idea of what a bubble is watch the big short.  Great movie that explains the hype and fall of a bubble.  You can make money off it, maybe not quick of you aren't putting that much money in it.  To make money through investment you have to risk it.  If you want something stable put it in a trust fund or something.   
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:51:44
Yea wtf is a stop loss in this volitile investment.  The market can go up $1000 in like 10 min and down $2000 in like half the time.

Wall street can suck my ass.  Watchin this drive to 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:48:30
$11,000 is nothing it was almost at that last night.  HODL you weak willed fools.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:52
How do ya sleep at night? Jk just don't freak out its not the end of the world.  Just ask yourself why you bought in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:46:18
Yea, but fees are crazy right now.  $15000 is a pretty good place to invest right now.  I think most of us never thought we would be able to invest at $15000 again.  If you have more, put it in and just don't look at it for this week.  Futures will scare people, but Hodl you weak fools.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:37:01
Hmmmmm is it a better idea to buy it cheap or at the all time high? Hard question to answer.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:38:44
Because its been a week and a half and my bank still hasn't recieved my money. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:03:47
Collusion, wallstreet is paying the news stations to instill fear in the masses to short btc so they can buy cheap.  Win win.  - every btc conspiracy theorist ever
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:09:05
Fuck this wall.  I'm trying to wake up and see it gone, but i still havent gone to bed and its 5am.  I guess in givin this wall a lil extra time to suprise me.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:10:12
You have a hold prob
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:31:03
Krakennnn 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:57:05
I think it's a good choice.  Just set something up.  Also a paper wallet is probably good for future transactions even if it's just $10.  Learn to keep your coin safe from the beginning.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:30
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:29:57
I would call customer cervice of your banks
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:14:28
Idk if your joking?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:30:06
Why are people so edgy rn.  Do we really have this little faith in bitcoin.  How can you put your money in something you don't believe will go up.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:23:24
If you did it through your bank probablly 7-10 days
And no its fine just chill and wait for it to go back up
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:31:56
Yea buying budget bitcoins makes you a baller.  If you actually want to be a rich motherfucker you'll be happy about dips and invest invest invest.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:28:32
CRASH hah what an overstatement.  Its higher than it was yesterday morning.  That is no crash.  Dip, but that always leads to more people buying.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:05:45
Go to gdax its free to transfer because its like the same company lower fees.  Gemini is good, idk im pretty new too
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:15:18
You should keep what you have and not be greedy.  The fees will fuck ya 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:44:31
Yea my mom asked me about that bitcone stuff a while back too
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:42:45
Haha i feel ya brother.  All my friends are just trying to make a quick buck.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:40:56
Yea one day when were all old fucks we are going to look back and say hey remember when bitcoin was 18,500.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:02:47
Is this your first time? Your bank puts a hold
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:46:59
Thanks man i just want some spending money for christmas.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:09:02
Im guessing a floor of 13k, but nobody really knows.  If you havent bought yet you might want to try buying some and if it doesnt go through call your bank and take the hold off your card.  Id jump in at like 14k or lower but anythings good, goodluck
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:29:01
I'm goin to make Wallstreet my bitch!
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:30:19
If you didn't pay for the coin how will you lose the money?
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:11:52
Im not speaking for everyone, but in my opinion donations are a sort of investment as well.  We are investing in the futures of the people we donate to.  Thats why people donate bitcoin to these foundations trying to shake the world up and help people.  In your situation this seems more like panhandling.  Free money isn't real.  Good luck in your endeavors, but as a student as well i feel like the time you spend asking people for handouts is worth more than you think.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:09:44
Jeez is it old, because im sorta young
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:21:54
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:21:35
�� Whats up roger ver
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:18:15
Well its at like 14 whatever now so if you want to take a loss + fees might as well hold 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:58:17
Yea in the end the winners are the ones who don't follow the pack.  Most people will buy in when others are and drop it just as quick.  Don't follow the pack, find your own path.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:55:48
Even if it doesn't go back up tomorrow, i believe once segwit and LN are implemented it will just shoot up hard and fast and maybe a lit sweaty, but definitly sticky.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:47:17
Hah its been less than one day.  The dip happened like 30 seconds ago and people are already dropping like flies.  I say don't stoke the fire because you may get burned.  If you really don't want them to short us don't post stuff that shows we are scared of being shorted.  If the public sells so easy they can short us like crazy and buy up all the weak hands.  If you really believe in the tech or just bitcoin itself hold onto it.  It isn't even that widely accepted yet.  The fees will drop and open up to a market easier for the public to jump into.  I believe the only way is up even if there are drop it can only go higher.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:24:23
I just played with my dog.  Idk if its stress or excitement, but sometimes i just need a break to enjoy the little things in life than stare at my screen watching bitcoin all the time.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:55:47
I just gotta say WTF.  This isnt free money.  Nothing is promised.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:28:54
Realistically your still up, but did you put it in for the short term gains, because in the long run it will be back up
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:01:33
