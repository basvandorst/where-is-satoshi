Dude, just copped an Alexa a few days ago. What a coincidence you'd say that. Didn't know it could do that. Thanks!

It was actually a whale friend of mine selling a bit. Not even kidding. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 21:28:01
Agreed. If the ETF is denied it will drop, but there's no chance it falls below 850. Think about where we were before the ETF started getting hyped up. That's likely where the floor is.
1000 is not the new floor yet. This is hype from the ETF

Your bitcoin is probably less safe than your money in the bank. 
Friend of mine lost 400,000 USD from Mt Gox going insolvent. Has yet to see any of it. 
He also lost about 200,000 in Bitfinex hack. Received about 140,000 back in finex shares.
Are you willing to lose 400,000$? Or are you willing to lose $60,000 next time?
It's not worth it. The next time it happens it might be the exchange you're using, and don't expect an FDIC-like entity to bail you out up to 250,000 USD. Expect to receive nothing, and maybe -60,000 if you're lucky. 
And yes, my friend is just that unlucky. He's been in BTC since &lt; 200$ and is actually just breaking even at the current price due to exchange hacks. Holds over 2,000 coins.

Just my two cents, but. The first 1000 mark was inorganic. Second was organic(last month), but was fueled by misconceptions. This broke psychological barriers. It's possible that this push past 1,000 could stay for a while. Or not. 
Regardless, breaking 1,000 consistently over the course of a month actually says a lot about future growth I believe.

Lmao. Dude predicted it 
@_date: 2017-02-03 04:19:48
I'm entirely open to what you're saying. I'm genuinely an inexperienced soul when it comes to finance, as I'm relatively young.
As I said to someone else, I just find it so hard to take 100% returns and force myself to take 6%. It just goes against everything I want. Would you really call it gambling? I have strong faith in it, but maybe not my life savings. 
What bothers me the most is that I'll be purposely trading high returns for low ones. (Sell some BTC for gold). Do you think it would be wrong for me to start investing in other assets now with new cash flow, or should I simply allocate funds differently ASAP?
Looking for a genuine take on things. Thanks for your input man.

lmao. Yeah but just figured I'd share the wealth of macOS lol
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:22:36
Just curious, what kind of safe? Currently I'm keeping my coins in a offline laptop on Electrum and I'd like to move them off any devices. I can't see myself spending money to save money on a hardware wallet. At least with a nice safe I'd be able to store some gold bars and other items in it. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 13:32:46
Well, no. He bought it when they were cheaper than 2,000,000. But yes, he holds between 1000 and 2000 coins currently. Would send wallet but I feel like that's not really my place to do, yknow.

Haha yes. If you do Command+Control+Shift+4 you can capture a certain portion of your screen to clipboard, or the same command followed by 3 to copy the full screen to clipboard. Super handy. 
Just something to leave you with: if you're hesitant to purchase a mac due to price, consider hackintosh. I built my PC to run OSX. 100% worth it. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:39:45
Command shift 4 on OSX:P
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:12:45
Well, why? I understand the risk, and am fully prepared to lose it all. My life savings is in BTC. I'm 19, still in education, and will have 300,000 in medical school debt. Is it THAT bad of an investment? I've seen over 100% gains since I started in BTC. I just can't get myself to purchase stocks that will get me 3% in a year when I have a firm belief in a technology elsewhere.. genuine question. Maybe I'm being an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:09:37
Someone give this guy more upvotes.
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:34:03
LOL, guess we'll see. I'm not saying it will go back down. I'm saying that if you think it seriously grew from 950 to 1300 for no reason other than the ETF you're being naive. I wonder why when it denied it fell down to(you guessed it) 950. Random, arbitrary number? No, it's where our floor is. It doesn't just so happen to stop at 950 and bounce back. Maybe people don't care about the ETF now and it will stay-- but we didn't just randomly get adoption from 950-1300 in a month IMO. 
Or maybe we did. I'm no expert. Just sharing my opinion. Trust me, I'm fine. I sold at 1280, bought at 980 and sold again around 1200. I'm fine. It just seems naive to think the ETF had nothing to do with it 
@_date: 2017-02-03 04:13:59
Full time medical student, business owner, and employee at another job(full time). I can't day trade or research a ton of stocks. I know you can see huge gains in things like that, but I don't know these companies well enough to trade or hold them. With bitcoin, it's a technology I know and think has potential. 
With any big ETF or large stocks I'd see like 6% if I'm lucky and day trading stocks just isn't something my time can handle at the moment. So, take the 100% gain or the 6%? That's why I'm so stuck. I know I should diversify, but I can't get myself to accept such low profit. :(
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:19:22
Nope! Man I'll send you some of my details in PM when I get home. 5 years ago--yeah, totally not worth it. Today? I have a completely vanilla install that I can update, no kernel panics or crashes, handoff, continuity, etc. I'm telling you, as long as you're not running an AMD processor it's 100x easier. 
And if you take some time to pick good products when building your PC for that purpose, it's flawless. Something to look into my man.
@_date: 2017-02-18 21:28:59
It will happen BEFORE it's publicly rejected, that's for sure. Winkles will call their friends the second they find out, which is before we will. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:34:23
If you think the growth from 900 to 1300 was true growth you're wrong. That recover is far to good to be true. The entire "growth" in the last month was due to the ETF. Or do you think it was due to the clogged blocks and transactions people were able to send? 
If the price hangs on here I'll be amazed.
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:40:48
hahahaha this. I had orders all the way down, which is great. But I had another 10k I planned to use to buy at my own discretion. I couldn't get into GDAX until 1100 and I wasn't buying back there lol.
@_date: 2017-01-18 03:54:00
guess it depends what you're striving for hahaha. As a medical student, my bitcoin holdings (10-20 coins) wouldn't even break my loans if the price hit 10,000 per. lol. Still hodling 
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:49:08
Doubt it. I don't know how much you all are HODLing but even if the price hits 10,000$ per I can't imagine you'd all be "rich"....
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:47:37
I laughed way harder than I should have

I'm an active lucid dreamer and so I remember my dreams probably more often than most, but I have this dream really often. Like weekly. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 21:41:05
I've had this discussion a few times. The way I see it is on both sides, the opposing party of the winner will run to Bitcoin due to fear of the unknown(or predictable future from $x president). I truthfully don't think we'll see much of anything from the election. If we do, it won't be a dip. Might just be a bump. We'll see tonight. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 15:59:24
Yeah, and then you'll end up in prison. Good luck.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:16:01
Don't worry. At 18 I did exactly this. My entire savings at 18 was 5k, and I dumped every penny in at exactly that price almost a year ago. So still it's only worth about 11k now. HODLing until mewn
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:39:09
Yeah this guys like made a name for himself here lol
@_date: 2016-12-15 18:59:20
He's here every day. He doesn't use any bank accounts at all. Buys bitcoin cash. Regardless, it's not practical for most people. For him, sure avoid paying taxes. For most of us, it's not ideal to try to hide lol
@_date: 2016-12-15 19:19:31
It's perfectly fine to do that. For most of us, at least in the U.S it's not practical to do things like that. Most of us aren't worried about paying taxes on our bitcoin or worrying about people knowing we bought them. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:34:58
Yup. Burned my first two weeks in BTC now I see myself losing 10,000$ and just laugh lol
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:50:31
Shit isn't over. I had a large sum of money in BTC for the last two years. With the BU shit going on, I'm uncomfortable.
Nothing to do with being weak, or wrong. I'm taking profit the whole way up as I dump. 
I love bitcoin. I don't love wondering where the fuck I'm being taken. Decisions need to be made. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 13:02:18
I laughed harder than I should have. Here's to winklepopping to the moon, my friend. 
@_date: 2016-09-05 02:46:07
Nah, I don't just sell off to sell lol. I would've bought more when it hit 480, just like I did anyway except I would've bought more :P but yeah, still hodling
@_date: 2016-09-04 03:33:51
Yo. Just had this dream last night. 100% serious. Price dropped down to 10$ and I was so worried/excited to buy more. Every time I tried I couldn't take action. It shot back up to 10,000s and I couldn't sell out either. 
Mind you I lucid dream often and these types of dreams are common, but.

This happened to me on vacation. I lost my phone before vacation, so 8 days during mid-June without access to GDAX to trade. Guess who missed out on selling his pre $400 coins at 750/BTC. :P
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:30:06
Nobody else got that, but I did. Gotchu fam.
