My node has been signaling for segwit since it was released, and the miners haven't pointed their hashing power towards the software my node signals.  Why?


What?  Electors in my state are legally bound to vote the way the voters in the state voted.  There is nothing like that in the bitcoin code.

what is the pastors drug of choice?  What darknet market do you think he will spend his coins on? 
Ill chip in 1 btc if he promises to spike the body of chirst with LSD at next sundays mass
@_date: 2017-02-05 16:27:35
But the node signaling doesn't choose the type of software the miners are using.  Users can signal all they want, but the decision is the miners to make.

I signed up for gemini on their first day so i don't remember exactly what all it took to link my accounts.  I know it wasn't an automatic thing like they have with some of the larger banks.
Im pretty sure they made a couple tiny deposits into my checking account and then i had to tell them the amount they deposited into my checking account, i think it was like $0.03 and $0.07.  After i did that i was able to initiate the ACH transfers to gemini from the account and instantly buy like OP was talking about.
And yes, ACH is the checking system.  Most people start with a $500/day limit at gemini and it goes up from there as you further verify your account.

I'm glad you like it.  Coinbase is the worst to their customers out of all the exchanges out there.  Ive had better customer service at BTC-E, despite their broken english, than the experience I've had at coinbase.

They are looking for info to put into the suspicious activity report (SAR) they are filing on you with fincen.
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:19:03
Seems like you could be proactive about solving that issue.
Whats stopping you from getting a different bank account?  
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:17:16
I dont see how OP's title isn't truthful, why modify the title at all.  Your account balance is credited with bitcoin instantly.  You dont have to wait 3-4 days before you can lock in a bitcoin purchase price on gemini.  
You can sell the bitcoins on gemini too while you wait for your ACH to clear.
And of course the reverse it if you don't have money to buy the bitcoins in your bank account.

I think you fundamentally misunderstand how an analogy works.

How does carrying a gun prevent you from being courteous to your neighbors when you go for a walk?  When i go for a walk, i keep my gun in a IWB holster.  The people i say hello to have no way of knowing i have a gun concealed on my person.

Its not an either or / black and white situation.  Its a gradient of preparedness.  


Why not just chill out man.
last time i was at a gun show nearly everyone was a heat packer but there was no heat released at all and no one got covered in anything. 
I'm gonna keep taking my gun with me everywhere I go, you seem upset about that so you should take a page out of you own book and just chill out about it.  Accept that you can't control or stop other people from using their 2nd amendment right.

@_date: 2017-02-04 17:13:08
Yeah, because obviously everyone with a coinbase problem came and posted on about it, am i right?

Wow, you are so lucky to live somewhere the state to regulates your life and makes decisions for you, god forbid you have rights and make your own choices about owning guns.

And you can ride clean shawty, you ain't got to walk
But there still one rule player, don't get caught

I see, although somewhat strange as I linked my local credit union account with my Gemini account for ACH transfers no problem. Possibly a larger credit union in the area will work with em?

Care to show some non suicide stats that show guns are dangerous for the person with the gun?  
Being the "most safe" or maximizing safety for the people around me is not my prerogative anyways, I prefer to aim for maximum freedom.  There is no problem, so i don't understand why you would think I'm a part of some supposed problem.  
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:14:01
not at all how coinbase works, coinbase has higher fees and you cant place an open order on the exchange ever.  On GDAX you have to wait for funds to clear

or familiarize yourself with the gun and learn to use and carry it in a manner that makes it hard for for an attacker to take it from you, but only do this if you aren't a scared anit-gun lil' bitch.

yes, when I place buys on gemini it generally takes 3-4 business days for the ACH to clear and i can send the coins out

wut, how?  Only the miners decide what software to run.
@_date: 2017-02-16 04:36:15
no, do you use coinbase?
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:42:38
Wait, you are a miner but you don't know about the block being full and block size debate?  Yes, lots of people are trying to complete transactions right now and everyone is waiting or paying a higher than normal mining fee.
No, you cant push the transaction along with your miner, unless you are able to successfully mine the next block.  Chances of mining the next block with 8 s7's is pretty low, use this site to expedite your transaction, 
They are miners who mine multiple blocks a day and will include your transaction in the next block. 
If you are really a miner, upgrade your software to the latest version of bitcoin core.

Coinbase has poor customer support, over-zealous KYC enforcement, and high fees compared to other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:50:43
Coinbase probably paid a low mining fee for your transaction, because they suck
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:29:04
move the funds to your bank account via ACH transfer.  Also sign up for an account on gemini.  Transfer funds from bank account to gemini via ACH transfer and buy bitcoins.

what does coinbase think about using a bitcoin tumbler?
Do you see using a mixer as suspicious activity?
Is using a mixer a prohibited use case for coinbase?
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:51:51


oh well in that case, pay the fee needed to move the money then and stop bitching.
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:40:38
I would use gemini or kraken as a first option depending on what is available to you.  Otherwise i would probably use a cash deposit at a local bank or credit union on localbitcoins.  Also, libertyx is good for buying bitcoins if there is a location by you.
@_date: 2017-01-27 04:50:16
you should look into alt coins if you want to send $2 transactions.  A $2 transaction is kind of small and spamy for bitcoin.  Or wait until you kid has earned like $50-$100 to send it to their address to cut down on the amount of fees you are paying.  I have had multiple transactions confirmed today with a fee of less than 2 cents.
