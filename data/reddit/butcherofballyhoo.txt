Does anyone find the timing to all of this a little fishy?  3 day miner/core dev meeting and now one of the bloodiest days across crypto markets.  Hate to throw accusations but its getting bizarre.

We were here long before you and your pathetic slave class discovered bitcoin.  You’ve inhaled so much boot polish it’s hard to think clearly when confronted with a detailed and sober review of the case.  Not my problem.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:32:27
The guy who had the hit placed on him believes Ross wasn’t behind it and has signed the clemency petition.  So please stfu!

There are no refunds in bitcoin bud.

You’re an idiot. Go away.

Fascinating to see all the hate for Ross on this sub.  Boy have times changed.  Regardless, Ross gave btc value for the first time bc he combined it with voluntary actions of consenting people to barter in illegal items.  University level studies revealed that this did have a positive impact on reducing violence in the drug game.  He is a hero.  If you think otherwise, you do not know the specifics of the case, and go off what bs is out there.  For instance, the person that supposedly had this hit placed on him by Ross has publicly stated that it wasn’t Ross and believed it was the DEA and treasury that were behind that plot. He’s signed the clemency petition. Oh and government dropped all of those non charges.  So if you parrot that lie, you’re either a troll, or illiterate.  Both don’t surprise me anymore on this sub.  Been here since 2012. Sad place.

@_date: 2016-01-27 14:29:31
To me, it seems that realistically &lt;20k people have a vested interest in the success of bitcoin according to the distribution chart below.  And that's being kind.  Yes there are others invested thru venture capital and owning company shares but the best way to invest in the tech is to own it.  Let's be honest, this is the clientele of a small bank.  Small banks go under all the time.  I own several bitcoins and have worked on spreading its adoption since early 2012 but it is beginning to dawn on me that the real paper tiger just may be us.  This is not to say that there is a competitor for bitcoin as it is the undisputed champ of crypto investment.  I am just trying to realistically understand the marketcap.

Winklevoss bitcoins incoming!!

The only kings they will be known for is the Bearwhale Kings when they dump 2% of all known btc on the market.  The SEC denial was an admission that the financial world will never give bitcoin a seat at the table.  These guys are table sitters, not dark market trolls or magic internet money speculators.

Is anyone concerned that price discovery has been turned over to the paper markets like CME and Bakkt?  To me, they are preventing any upward momentum.
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:32:32
Buy signal.  Dash ath was $1600.  It has more development and is used more than any other alt for retail.  Thanks for driving the price down with your idiotic maxi propaganda!
@_date: 2019-12-12 15:39:07
If there is no upward movement there will probably be a hashrate downturn mid 2020, but this could actually allow smaller operations with efficient rigs to enter and remain profitable.   I will not weep for the communist mining behemoths that need to close their doors.
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:57:29
Scarcity is not an issue unless the contracts are physically settled.  Chico Crypto blew the spot on Bakkt.  It’s a fraud.  Just like the CBOE, CME it’s paper contracts.  The only difference is with in house custodial settlement,  which means it can easily fractionally manipulate its holdings.  Another scam just like with gold/silver.
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:04:53
But the paper contracts could end up setting prices just like in the gold market still for the foreseeable future

So essentially, a big enough fund can use its power and leverage to steer btc in the direction it wants.  It could even compromise development teams, online forums and most of all miners with threats of dumping in order to achieve its goals.  Got it. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:25:16
People would rather not remember that the last bear market really lasted 3 years not 1 like everyone is saying.  I was there for that one and others.  20K in 2020.  But its going to sit around 2-5K for several years.

Full nodes secure the network so they're the only ones that matter.  There is no glory in having a bunch of lightweight nodes and it can sometimes even be a security risk. Oh and btw, most of those full nodes are being run in a country that is now openly hostile to bitcoin. That sounds like decentralization. Sure buddy.

Ive been in bitcoin since 2011.  I remember when it was only used on the dark web, it was also worth $10-20 and governments really had no control of the dark web back then.  Just highlighting the use cases continue to disappear 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:58:30
Fine. Still that evaluation will be a fraction of its current value.  Not to mention, coin analysis companies are on the rise.  Other projects have better capabilities and cryptography for this use case if you're pegging your hope on this now.  Bleak outlook.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:01:24
This seems precedent setting.  I see more governments following suit. I'm glad we spent all that time and energy on arguing about scaling.  Well done lads.

I don't have to memorize my "gold address".  Bitcoin will even lose at this last use case. Thanks for making my point.

6404 Core Nodes not tens of thousands. There are several other projects that actually have more.  Price is everything.  Price encapsulates the totality of information needed to inform a consumer of value.  Econ 101.  Oh I forgot, we don't like economics on this sub. My bad.

Reality is harsh. I've read every anarchist, libertarian thinker and I agree with its morality and its mission, but sadly its as utopian and unrealistic as Marxist doctrine, even more so because Marxist doctrine is at least in being practice by large organized portions of the populations (see China, Venezuela) You'll outgrow the idealism one day.  Dreams are fun, but not productive.

If brain wallets are the only way to keep funds safe the market will value this technology very little.  Satoshi's brain wallet will be worth a couple bucks.  The libertarian romance really fades when you have your net worth wiped out like this kind of legislation would do to so many.
