[10:58] &lt;JonWickedFire&gt; Is that Crisis Strategy Draft even legit?  
[11:04] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; more or less  
[11:05] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; as the name suggests it's a draft, and it's a bunch of proposals to deal with the issue at hand, not things that are actually planned and/or done  
[11:06] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; this said this document was not produced by MtGox
Basically, this seems to imply that the document was made by a consulting/strategy company external to Mt Gox. The most important aspect of this is that it practically confirms the 700k bitcoin loss as the supposition of the of crisis. The strategy firm would have been given those unchangeable details, although the course of actions following may be different than is in the draft.

And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail.

I'm going to go a little against the circlejerk and say that older people have had many more experiences where they've been told that something will change the world, etc, and it turned out to be bunk at best and a scam at worst. These kinds of experiences add up to a large amount of skepticism because no one likes to be fooled twice. However, my feeling on this is that there are always the black swans that really do come through on the promise, and Bitcoin is likely one of these.

The nominal difference isn't quite so important as the relative difference. It's still bad, though, as bitcoin is a 55% drop away from 200 versus a 444% rise to two thousand. A more fair choise would be 200 and 818 or 101 and 2000. But using the two "twos" makes the bet seem more 'cool' I suppose.

This is not the important question. The important question is where does the value come from? The answer is in it's ability to facilitate trade. When two parties get together to trade, the value propositions are rarely, if ever, the same. A person with a lot of pigs wants dollars more than keeping a pig, while a person who wants a pork dinner wants a pig more than their dollars. This asymmetry in trades leads to where there is almost always a gap between what one person is willing to give on the high end and what the other is willing to accept in the low end. In between these two numbers, value can be extracted.
A simple example is with credit cards, which take commonly 2.9% of the value from a transaction. So a customer would be willing to pay $100 for something, but the merchant is willing to accept $97.10. Let's pretend this is an online merchant. The reason they are fine with it is because there is no easy way for this transaction to exist without paying the value, and they will still be making a profit on the item, and the customer is fine with it because they want that item and they can't (easily) get it elsewhere for cheaper.
So you can see how there can be value from each transaction. What this means is that a person can buy .1 bitcoin @ $1000, use it to buy something from a seller, and the seller could go to sell the .1 bitcoin at $971 and still get the same value as the credit card transaction and everyone is happy. The person who bought the .1 bitcoin from the seller; they sell it to the next buyer at $1000.
So, this is pretty explicitly how Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme but it uses an extremely simple example. The real world doesn't exactly behave like this, and you have to add in that a lot of the value right now is from speculation. However, not *all* of the value is.
tl;dr: currencies derive their value from trade.

Sorry, but no. The split key system makes it unlikely that vanity.appspot.com had any idea what the final private key was. The system works by extending from a private key only you know (say q), so that when they find a solution n from there, you use (q+n) as the bitcoin private key. Since there is no way to know q, they can't know q+n.

Yes, at least for "card not present" transactions (I think the rule is slightly different for "card in hand" like at a grocer).

It's an online bank that allows for intrabank money transfers from two customers' accounts. Actually Wells Fargo and Chase have similar mechanisms and should be thought of the same way. You log onto your online account, hit a few keys, and the money is transferred to another person's account. Rightly so, it does seem that hackers are using this as a lower risk way of cashing out.
As far as cash deposit goes, I've read an article linked here (but can't find it) that some banks are now no longer allowing them, or at least they can flag your account for freezing. It's kind of sad because I've used this method to get some cash quickly to a friend of mine in another city, and then they did the same to pay me back. It seems really convenient, but it seems that it has been happening so much now that it's on someone's radar.

The topic of bitcoin has become a little polarized on reddit. Part of it is the fanboyism that occurs towards the currency turning people off. Part of it is the perception that bitcoin is politically tied to libertarian ideals and this rustles the jimmies of EPS and ELS type people. Part of it is the lingering reputation of the system just being a scam. All of these things, though, make it kind of a crapshoot if you tip with bitcoin outside of a bitcoin subreddit. Very often if you are in a major subreddit, you will get brigaded by ELS.
Dogecoin is seen as a lighthearted joke, even at the expense of bitcoin, so it gets a pass.

The problem is the byzantine generals problem, and it comes from the fact that there could be a bad actor in the system. Without centralization, there's no "official record" and this allows someone to execute a few timing based attacks. Essentially, I can send to Alice's part of the network that I'm paying her and then also send to Bob's part of the network that I'm paying him. If I only have enough money to pay one of them, then which one gets paid?
As it stands, the miner who wins the block decides who gets paid by validating one transaction thus invalidating the other. I always say that mining orders the transactions. Without this ordering, you can't prevent people from spending twice because of the decentralization.

No, it's just a reverse linked list like haakon said.
First the miner packages up a few transactions that they want to include in the blockchain and add their own reward address to make a block. Then they take the hash of all the previous blocks plus the hash of this block plus a little number that they spin up. They keep spinning that number up under the hash is less than a certain number. Then they send out the the network "I have a solution, here it is" and that gets added to the end of the list.
By taking all the transactions in order going forward, you can work out what address has how many coins. You just keep adding coins to the reward addresses and then debiting/crediting based on the transaction log. You verify the transaction log is in order by running the hash against what is said to be the hash. There's no tree.

I want to make sure that it's understood that number 2 is not entrapment. Entrapment is when the police get you to do something you otherwise normally wouldn't. A good example is them telling you that if you don't buy the drugs, then they will pin a s,all arms charge on your sister who will have to do hard time. Another example might be if they offered you an unreasonable fee, like $100k to broker the drug trade when they knew you had money problems. It involves a psychological trick to coerce you into an action. Simply offering drugs on a website where there are other people offering drugs is not going to count as entrapment, ever.

The motivation is reputation. You can either try to scam a small amount of coin once, or establish a way to get a flow of coin. Another thing is escrow, where the bitcoin funds are held by a third party that ensures the bitcoins are sent, and generally removes the motivation because if the goods or services aren't provided, then the coins won't be sent.

No, you can have the client on another computer, but you have to point your mining software there (again the same 4 second routing applies). You could have a client on the clearnet, and connect to it with your miner software via TOR.
This really just protects you from an exploit in the client. If there's, say, a buffer overrun in the client that can come in on the blockchain feed, then your client can get owned. If you are mining on the same machine, then your miners are owned as well. If it's split up, then the attacker would need to inject an attack down the RPC that the miners are calling (pretty unlikely). This is entering into super paranoid territory though, and at this point, they've got your spending keys so the fact that they can take over your miners is a little moot (unless they grief you by bricking your ASICs with a bad flash or something).

This comes to the conclusion that it is at least 5 MW, but FPGAs are about 10 MH/W, so at 14.16 THps, that means a lower bound of 1.4 MW. I can see it probably being closer to 3 because there are still a lot of card miners.

I know what you're talking about, but I really don't think there is enough of a problem to need to call to action. In most cases, the post isn't directly related to bitcoin, but it could prompt a discussion of bitcoin relating to the topic. I don't really see a problem with that, even with the guidance of "News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic."
Personally, what I think it more of a problem is the blogspam. I don't know how many articles have been posted about the Bitcoin-central announcement, but IMO it is way too many. People do seem to be using the subreddit to drive bitcoin traffic to their crappy blogs. If someone has a new perspective, or additional details (typical for codinginmysleep or mircea's blog), then that's fine. But a lot of them were just quoting quotes from a non-source article. It was really maddening.

Investments are based on the growth of the company. The classic definition is money given to the company for the purpose that the company can grow their business.

The monetary effect however, right now, is one of inflation. As an example, there are reasonable investments and bonds (e.g. mining bonds) that you can subscribe to and have it so that mathematically there is a potential future profit. Once the amount of coins in the wild is closer to 21 million, the investment landscape will be very different. Another effect is that if the bitcoin adoption falls below the monetary inflation rate, then the value will ostensibly move downwards. It's because new people are coming onboard at a rate higher than 26% per annum that the btc/usd value keeps moving up.

The problem is that this is too simple of an explanation, and bitcoin monetary inflation does have important effect. There are many reasons why you can't just take the trading volume as the key indicator of the source of coins:  
- trade bots will buy and sell coins all day long. This looks like volume, but it has no real effect on supply  
- if there is a cycle where a person buys coins, makes a purchase from a seller, and then the seller sells those coins on the market, that also has no real effect on supply, but it shows up as trade volume
The real effects on supply are when miners get new coins and decide to sell them, or people decide to reduce their bitcoin savings. These two things will cause the value to go down. On the opposite side is when people decide to increase bitcoin savings with coins they didn't mine.

It's doubtful. Mining power has no real effect on the rate of bitcoin inflation because the algorithm readjusts to the average hashrate over the last 2016 to make 2016 block take 2 weeks. So ASICs will knock out GPUs and FPGAs from being able to mine profitably, but they will not increase the bitcoin supply.
There could be network reshaping that makes it so that more people are selling post-ASIC, and that might drive price down, but my feeling is that a lot of coins right now are mined by botnets to liquidate immediately, and a large number of casual GPU miners spend their coins on things immediately. As such, I don't expect much of a difference. It's also important to note that the daily bitcoin award (3600) is only about 10-15% of Mt Gox's 24h trade volume.

You ran afoul of KYC and AML laws. Blame the war on terror and drugs, not Mt Gox, which needs to comply because, unlike yourself, they are not protected by anonymity and would face full liability exposure and possible jail time if they were to let other people using the same technology as you to do notoriously nefarious acts funded through Gox.
These requirements have been known for a while, so while I am sorry for your situation, this is not something that should have been a surprise. At this point, I can't help but feel that you have done this a little to yourself.
I understand the risks you have in identifying yourself to your host country, but Mt Gox is in Japan, and so sending them your KYC documents is not going to expose you there. If you are really that concerned about operating over clearnet, then I would suggest that you find an anonymous Wifi cafe to do work on transferring your coins to a private wallet.

I think that the mining rewards should drop with every mined block using a logarithmic function, rather than having a steep cliff every few years. This would make planning easier, and it would show the results of the reducing block reward much sooner. Instead, there will be some weirdness in the months leading up to December when it halves, people hoarding coins, maybe some people coming online for one last go at hashing and pushing the difficulty up. It's hard to say.
Then, on the other side, I would make some transaction fees mandatory and based on the gap in the mining reward from 50 btc time the size of your transaction divided by the total transactions in the last block, up to a certain percent (maybe 1%) to prevent a weird block with small transactions from messing it up. I might be proven to be wrong about needing this, but it's something I think about.

Don't use this example to derive any understanding of PKE because it's not related.
In PKE, there is a public key that is mathematically linked to a private key, but that link is such that discovering the private key from the public key is very difficult (will take more time than the universe has to solve). Then there is a way to use the public key to transform a message into unintelligible data, and that unintelligible data can be reverted back to the original message only with the private key.

This is really a basic understanding of economics. The reason people believe in these opposing outcomes is because Iran has a trade surplus due to their export of oil while the US has a trade deficit (for extremely complicated reasons). In addition, the US is well reounded in its resources, so it could engage in some protectionism and be able to provide for all of its needs, while Iran is heavily tilted to oil but dependent on other countries to sustain itself (it doesn't even have refineries for the oil).
That being said, there are negatives to US protectionism so the actual outcome of such a policy would be murky.

There are some improvements to hacking, but the real advantage would be that you will mine anonymously, which would make it difficult for others to account how much you are earning, or to tie your transactions to you.

By material money, do you mean cash? This has lost over 98% of it's value in the last 99 years. It's not a good way to store long term value. It's practically impossible to do this and expect to retire. Plus you're now open to robbery or fire.
Maybe you mean silver/gold. Keeping gold is likely a good idea, but I would say hedge with bitcoin. Don't think of gold as a competition but as a complement to Bitcoin. However, in comparing the two Bitcoin has a lot more growth potential, so just a 5% storage of wealth can put you in a pretty good spot in the future. On the other side, Bitcoin has a lot more risk because it is new, so going over 5% is probably risky in itself. Finally, with gold, you are still at risk of robbery, or you'll have to pay some amount for secure storage, which has a third party risk as well.

Some constructive criticisms  
- There are typos (you'r) and typography errors (no space around one comma, then a space before a comma and none after). These need to be fixed to look professional.  
- You need more whitespace. Things seem crammed together.  
- The font for the filler should not be larger than the supposed content. In other words "Bitcoin is growing and the thing you can buy with bitcoins are growing to" is not as important as "Buy vpn services with bitcoins." but from the size you would think the opposite.  
- Prevention of double spending is an important aspect of decentralized currencies, but it's something no merchant has ever thought about. Inclusion of that point seems like pandering  
- Just in general the site as it is screams "non-American trying to cash in somehow" which goes against the trust of the site. This lack of trust is reflected in how people are voting for this submission on reddit.

The description he gave was not a lotto pool. It's was a book site. They weren't supposed to be buying lottery tickets in the same way that a sports site wouldn't buy an nfl team. It simply allowed you to bet that such and such numbers would be the picks. The reason they did pick 3s, is because the max payout isn't very high. From a strictly odds perspective, you can make money with low risk.
In fact betting this way may have even been better than buying a lotto ticket because lotteries almost always have a 50% margin on their odds, while a site like this could do 10% margin and make a ton of cash.
And I'm sorry, but having seen how the governemnt justifies things in their writeups for friends of mine who have been indicted/prosecuted, you have to take all these things with a giant grain of salt. These people were choosing to bet on the site of their own free will. If you think there is an overall moral issue with gambling, including sites like betsofbitcoin, then I can see you perspective (even though I don't agree with it). Otherwise, I personally feel accepting the government's statements prima facie is a little naive.

It's paid by the sender and is in addition to the amount you pay. The fee right now is added automatically by the standard client and you will get a warning to that effect.


BitCoin payments are a little weird. Basically they can be from a bunch of places to a bunch of places. If you are paying 5 btc with a .05 fee, from address X, it might have gotten 2 btc from address Y and 3.5 from address Z before, so on the sending side you have two parts sending a total of 5.5, then you have two destination addresses, one is who you are sending to which has two transactions with 2 and 3 coins going to it, and one is your address which has .45 coins going to it (sending you change). The .05 gap goes to the person who solves the block that your transaction is in. Anyway, you can see that each time you get something in, that amount stays as a unit when you are sending it out. Depending on the order the client uses to prevent fragmenting, it can change the size of the whole payment.


Well, it means 1 miner says it's yours. They might be lying though. After 6, it becomes unlikely that all of them have lied.

If we really had a CPU only mining system, then we might as well hand the network to the botnets.

The "problem" with bitcoin access the time distribution, not the location distribution. People in on it earlier were able to mine more bitcoins.
Well a lot of the gold was mined before I was even born, and the mining rights are all owned by people who got into it before me. It's a "problem" with gold too!
Early adopters deserve their bitcoins because they built up the system we use today. They believed in it when it was just a silly little side show. Block chain analysis shows that a lot of the early blocks are untouched, so they might have been mined and lost anyway. I don't see this as a huge issue.

This is a pretty large topic which doesn't have a single answer. A high level is that the way that debt is supposed to work is the price of debt should be based on the availability of credit. Without the ability to create money at will, this availability comes from the amount of savings people have. The more savings, the cheaper credit is, which is good because when you introduce a new product that people want, they will have the money to spend on it. Alternatively, when savings are low, the availability of credit is low and this drives rates up. This doesn't prevent people from taking bad loans, but it does present a signal to businesses on the feasibility on their expanding.
The contrast is where the fed suppresses rates unnaturally, even suppressing below inflation effectively offering negative interest rates. This then leads to bad allocations in the market. High leverage and bad investments leads to a deeper crises.
Another example is less of a deep crisis but a shallow long one. This can be caused by a stalling of the economy that is attemped to be reversed by government spending through borrowing, while propping up borrowing through currency issuance (so called Quantitative Easing). A country that has tried this is Japan, which has resulted in massive debt loads (over 220% of GDP) with no real result. If they originally had to take a short period of pain, they would have naturally recovered. Now, once the lenders start to ask for their money, people will be massively wiped out. Inflationary fiat is making their bad situation worse.
Finally, there is of a deep crisis is hyperinflation. There are many causes of hyperinflation, but they all stem from a loss in confidence in the currency. Bitcoin is not immune to this, as there is the possibility that tomorrow everyone will stop trading in Bitcoins and will try to sell out their inventories. However, the causes that would trigger this are yet unknown. With inflationary currencies, there are a few causes, one of which is the issuing country overproducing the currency so that holders no longer feel they will have value in the near future. This isn't something known to the US, but it is known to Venzuela, Zimbabwe and others.

However, the ability to exchange bitcoin as currency for goods and services is what is giving people faith in the currency. In addition, more value is added when bitcoin is used as currency instead of as a wealth store, so the more it is circulated, the more robust the value is.

This is kind of a dreaded question because the definition of money varies from person to person. However, it is clear that it is "currency" which is a commonly shared unit of account that is used in an economy to trade goods and services. As such, think of it like any non-native currency, like the Japanese Yen, but with the difference that this is easily transmitted over the internet and not tied to one geographical region. It is often called "internet currency".
You can buy lots of things with bitcoin. The two biggest stores with things for sale are [BitMit]( a kind of ebay, and [Bitcoin Store]( an electronics store which currently has a $1000 minimum purchase, but will soon be dropping that. Another common use of bitcoins is to purchase [VPN access]( or fund [online gambling](


Now that you are thinking about these like Japanese Yen, think about the question "how do you earn Yen." In most cases, you don't. Instead you would [exchange dollars for bitcoins]( and make your purchases that way. In my experience, this is often worth it because of discounts or even access you can find in the bitcoin economy, but it isn't worth it for everything.
However, you could always sell items on BitMit, or perform services for others in the community. Outside of that, you could mine bitcoins (see below).


Generally, you'll have to trade dollars for bitcoins. Then you can trade those bitcoins for your goods or services. There are very little fees involved in this: sometimes no fee, sometimes a fee amounting to less than a cent depending on how much load you are putting on the miners with your transaction (see below). Ultimately, you aren't getting stuff for free, so yeah you need to spend some money, but outside of that there is no real cost.


Mining is running an algorithm that orders the transactions being made in bitcoin into a ledger. The amount in transactions don't really matter, but you can have transactions with a lot of information in them, and these require you to pay the miners a small fee so that they include it while running the algorithm. If they don't include it, then the transaction remains unconfirmed, and it's like it hasn't happened yet.
So miners run this algorithm, and they pick up these fees, and in addition they get a reward of more bitcoins. This reward is based on how many times the ledger has been updated, and just recently lowered from 50 btc to 25 btc. Right now, it pretty much requires specialized hardware and some administration knowledge to be able to mine. It can be profitable, but if you don't do your analysis, it can easily ruin you.

Because lending in America is highly regulated, even as a credit union. APRs have to be provided and they must be denominated in USD. You cannot, for example, make a loan of 30 bushels of wheat to be repaid with an APR of 5% bushels of wheat. Because bitcoin is more of a commodity used as currency, rather than legal tender, you wouldn't be able to get a court to enforce a loan in that commodity.

I'm glad you went through the exercise on how to improve it, though I'm sorry to say that I don't like yours more. I could pick apart yours peice by piece, especially the cringeworthy use of the word "future" twice in near secession; but the purpose isn't to pick on you: it's to get you to realize how hard it is to creatively wright a succinct analogy that no one has an issue with. In truth, any attempt to get closer to the truth removed the parsimony in the original verse, which deducts against its style.
I don't think the statement really implies that the exchange rate of bitcoins is halving. It's just an analogy and taking it this way is too literal. It just comes across to me like saying "The applause was thunderous" is a bad metaphor because the sound was not created by electricity. It's missing the forest for the trees.
One thing I really do want to make a correction on, and only because it is a peeve of mine, is you conflation of the terms price inflation and monetary inflation. Monetary inflation is exactly what bitcoin is experiencing because of the fact that the total money supply is increasing. This is the agreed protocol. The net effect is likely price deflation because more people are coming into bitcoin than the monetary inflation has the ability to serve.
It actually used to be that the singular term *inflation* referred to monetary inflation, that is the increase in the money supply, and that to mean price inflation you would have prefix it. Sometime in the 70s, though, the terms flipped and "inflation" became price inflation and monetary inflation needed the prefix. I don't really care either way, and in online forums I pretty much always put the prefix in either case in order to be more clear. But I do care if we are starting to redefine monetary inflation as price inflation, because A) that just doesn't make sense and B) then we have no way of referring to monetary inflation.

Skyler827 is incorrect. Everyone can have a copy of your bitcoins and most people do. There are thin wallets that don't but the standard client downloads all the coins. Your coins are not in your wallet.dat file, they are on the blockchain which is distributed in a peer to peer fashion across the network.
What is in the wallet.dat file is a key that allows you to spend the coins. These keys aren't protected by IP laws because they are algorithmically random and IP doesn't apply to them. What they are is a secret (like a password), and I don't think in general that people who are against IP are against people keeping secrets.

@_date: 2012-11-20 18:45:31
Yes, that is correct. I will say that the anonymity I was talking about though was not in the bitcoin address, but in the fact that to relay a solution to the network or just a share to a pool, you expose you IP. This would hide you IP from everyone. In bitcoin, your anonymity is only able to be compromised when you spend a coin, because you relay the transaction out from your IP. If you run bitcoin on this, then you would also be protected. However, that last part is easy to do in the standard client using SOCKSv5 and pointing it at TOR and now freenet (see [this post]( on that).
The slight advantage I see on hacking is that because you are relayed through TOR, it is like having a NAT that can't be located. All of the other services on your system really can't be discovered, so there's no chance of a hacker finding a backdoor in another program or service you are running.
I don't see an advantage to mining in RAM other than maybe IO speed. I'm not sure how ninjaboot does the program loads.
Edit: grammar. typing too quickly  
Edit 2: Be aware, though, that if you are seriously concerned about  hacking, you should not run a peered bitcoin client on the machine where you are mining. The reason is that an exploit vector can be through the peer networking for the client. You'll still be exposed via the peer networking in the mining software, but what can you do.

I think you're putting too much stock to that tongue in my cheek, I'm not being overly serious, although there is room for doubt which is kind of fun to play on.
The fact of the matter is that the NSA has only demonstrated in the past strengthening cyrptography. An example is their contribution to the [Lucifer cipher]( when transforming it to DES:
*IBM submitted the Feistel-network version of Lucifer as a candidate for the Data Encryption Standard (compare the more recent AES process). It became the DES after the National Security Agency reduced the cipher's key size to 56 bits, reduced the block size to 64 bits, and made the cipher resistant against differential cryptanalysis, which was at the time known only to IBM and the NSA.*
But the quote clearly shows that the NSA in the past has had access to cyrptanalysis that was *not* generally known to the public. This is where the window of doubt comes in. Obviously the NSA wants cryptographic tools that are strong because they will be used by the military and any weakness is operational weakness, but what if they had something that could give them a shortcut that they felt they could keep secret. You say "it only takes one to tell," but people generally don't go breaking treasonous information security laws against the most powerful monitoring agency in the world. Or maybe they do and we've never heard about them. It's possible, and thus there's the fun in entertaining the notion.

That said, a lot of items never get bid on. This is because  
- they are priced too high relative to a similar item on ebay. sometimes this is because it was listed in btc and the btc price went up.  
- the seller has no feedback and refuses to do escrow. These are scams and should not be bid on anyway. There's no reversibility in bitcoins so sellers need to know they have to wait until the buyer receives the goods. Well established sellers can probably get away with it.

It means that Bitmit will hold the coins until the buyer receives the items and marks them for release. If you don't mark your auction as escrow, then people will just think you're trying to get them to send coins without actually sending a card. This will result in 0 bids.
I also suggest doing a buy it now, and just setting the price as the value of the card. Visa cards seem to go at par with their value (e.g. a $50 card goes for $50 in btc buy-it-now). Amazon credit goes for a slight discount (e.g. $50 Amazon goes for $45 in btc). There will be some bitmit fees, but this is really the easiest way to convert a gift card into btc.

Bitcoin transactions are copied to anyone on the network that wants them in a peer to peer fashion. There's no verification of legitimacy for the servers, but there is verification of the transaction register (called the blockchain) by miners. As a reward for verifying the transactions, miners get a set amount of bitcoins.
There are no coins in your wallet, there are only keys in your wallet that let you spend coins. The coins are on the blockchain that everyone is copying. You really can't insert new coins into the blockchain because no one would believe you. At best you can rewrite some past spending of coins, but this requires a large amount of computing power: almost 200 petaflops, easily in the millions to acquire. Doing so would probably destroy the value of the coins overnight, and instead you could use that money to earn tens of millions per year, so there is little economic reason to do this.

This is just wrong. When a CPU is idle, it uses less electricity than when it is active. The same is true for a GPU or anything that processes. You would be doing these people a disservice.
If you do proceed, you should look more at mining litecoin and exchanging for bitcoins. You will get a lot more money, but probably still not enough to offset their power bill.

"inflation" may not be, but "monetary inflation" is precisely the correct term. The term "inflation" typically refers to "price inflation". Before the 70s, it actually referred to monetary inflation, but the default meaning got swapped, I'm guessing because of the economic issues at that time.

There's also a bidwall at 10.50. I don't want to be "that guy", but people often ask on here "should I buy now or will it go down later." It is possible that the price will go down even under $10, but there is way more upside potential. Now that we are in double digits, it's become hard to say there is a risk of bitcoin defaulting completely (e.g. price goes to 0). We've pulled up to here from $2, so there is a strong case now that all of the doubts of last year were unfounded.
This means buy now and soon, because we can easily get to $12 and probably get to $15. If you look at [the depth chart]( it is highly skewed to the right, with an easier path to $12 than $10.49.

My  personnal feeling is that we are too early in the Bitcoin economy to consider it divorced from fiat. It's a typical  conversion that many people do in their head or on  a calculator when buying something in BitCoin.
The only thing I  want to bring up regarding this is that if you don't get a lot of sales from the BitCoin area, part of it will be because people will see the price difference and just use Paypal, especially since for most people there are even more costs in aquiring their BitCoin (trade and transaction fees).
If I can make a suggestion, BitPay can run all the conversions to fiat for you with a slightly lower fee than PayPal.

At that time btc was trading for around $10 so I was able to at least say it had rebounded, but it's a pock mark that causes people to think twice about adoption.

Finally, you need to list that language name in that language, with maybe English in parenthesis, because speakers of that language do not want to look for their locale using English.
But I would also change the header to say "Language"

I once bought something from an online store. The order went into a status where they were waiting for new stock. This place was the only place that offered this item and I really wanted it, so I left the order. A few months later, it was apparent that they weren't going to get any new stock, and so I tried to cancel the order (the site was still up and accepting other orders). There was no response for another month, and I emailed a few times. I called up my bank company and asked what the time limit was on disputes.
They said there was literally no time limit as long as the vendor was still in business. I could invoke a charge back 2 years later if I wanted and Mastercard would claw it back or just deduct that amount from their next payment. I cancelled the order and after 45 days, the money appeared in my account.
This would work for Paypal, though. They do have a strict 90 day dispute window, which I ran up against once.

No. This is how bitcoins are minted, and it's an important service to the network because you are solving the double spending problem. It also doesn't devalue in the long term because the rate of issuance is tied to the difficulty, so once you have this advantage, it will slow down the issuance. This still gives you a larger share relative to other miners, but the overall total is still the same.

I actually agree with the statement that bitcoin is too hard for 90% of people. But this in and of itself shouldn't be the end of the decision process on whether to use it. It's say that less than 1% of the people are smart enough to use Usenet. So then the question is, do the 10% of the people who are smart enough to use Usenet greatly intersect with the 1% of the people who might use your product.
The answer is yes, they are. People who are able to get binaries from newsgroups are going to be able to use bitcoin to pay for access. This is why there are so many VPN providers offering Bitcoin and doing well. There's even a [competing newsgroup provider]( 
They aren't shutting down, but this site is. That's why a future question really will become "what is your bitcoin strategy?"

Another thing is that there are tamper evidident protections on the Casasicius coin. It's not enough to verify that the coins haven't been spent, you need to verify that the private key has not been copied because the seller could just spend the coins later if they have it. So you make sure the hologram does not appear disturbed. This ensures that only Casasicius has seen the private key, and trust in him and his product is what makes it so you know he hasn't copied it.

You have to weigh mining cost against cost to just buy bitcoins, and really you need to do your ROI in bitcoins and not in dollars. If you have $1000 now, is it better to buy 91 bitcoins now or buy a machine that produces 7.5 bitcoins a month. What about the reward halving? What if the difficulty goes up from ASICs? What if ASICs aren't delivered but more minirigs come online? You might never be able to mine 91 bitcoins total and your chance to get them is gone because the price is higher later.

"Pool0 not sending fast enough" can be related to your own connection or your route to deepbit. It's a little hard to debug on the internet because it can be a lot of things. This can lead to your numbers being lower than expected. I haven't experienced the reset you are talking about.
If this continues to be a problem, I realize you may not want to switch pools, but slush supports a protocol called Stratum that gets rid of 99% of these pool not sending fast enough issues. Essentially you install a small server on your machine and your miners mine to it, and it points to slush and it cuts down on the traffic and gives work practically immediately. That's all I can suggest here.

Bitcoins are generated by running a program that attempts to "solve" a mathematical problem. When the math problem is solved, it sets an ordering of a set of transactions. This is important to preventing people from double spending because with all of the transactions ordered, you can figure out who has been paid what. The generated coins go to the address that is specified as part of the solution. There is an agreed amount of bitcoins awarded based on the block number. Currently this is 50, but it will reduce to 25 in December, and so on every 4 years.
It is not illegal to convert bitcoin to real money, and there are many legal exchanges to do this in many currencies. It is not tax evasion to convert bitcoins into real money, bu tit is tax evasion to do so and not report it as income. In some places it may be considered tax evasion to just receive the coins and not report the fair barter value as income.
@_date: 2012-10-17 22:07:02
It's not possible to know if someone is inspecting an address for the number of coins in it. This is because by design all of that information is in the blockchain which is copied to any node in the bitcoin network that wants it, and this is necessary for the bitcoin network to validate the blockchain. The entire structure of bitcoin relies on in, so unfortunately I don't think it can be done.
If you're talking about spending from there, then you could do this, but then why wouldn't the attacker move out 100 btc.

I have a spreadsheet with many popular video cards and their watt usage and profitability. When changing the reward from 50btc to 25btc, about 3/4ths of them went negative in profitability at 11c/kwh. Most of the others have profitability above 80 months.

Buying a mining rig is a trade in on present value for perceived future value. Since miners will continue to buy the products past the point of profitability, this approach gives a maximum payment with a minimal risk.

On thing, though, is that I feel that it makes sense not to have a binary condition for trust, but maybe some metadata with respect to a person. For example, if I were a grocer, I would have a loyalty card and as people used it I would internally calculate my profit from them as a running total. Then if a purchase is &lt; 50% of that, I might just approve a 0 confirmation, but higher I would require 1, and maybe at another level i would need 2. This way I would guarantee that I would always have a profit from a customer at no risk to me, but over time that trust relationship allows the customer more benefit.

Discounting the protective nature of IPOs, is it unfair when someone invests their money in a company and that company does well. For example, if instead of buying a mac in 1990, you bought AAPL stock, you would now have over $1 million. Is that "unfair"? I don't see why.

I'm going to give a real answer because "toilet paper" is a joke (that's not even the op).
The difference between speculation and investing is that investors understand the business, take a look at the actual performance of the company, and vet the projected performance. It uses things like forward P/E and the context of the industry to arrive at a price. If you care, I can go into a lot more detail into how this conversion happens, but that is really more for and not Speculation by contrast is more of an analysis not of the business but of the instrument itself and asking "what do I think I can sell this for in the future." An excellent example is the facebook IPO where investors piled in because they felt that the popularity of facebook would translate into their ability to sell the stock later. This turned out disastrously wrong.
Taking it back to bitcoin, bitcoin is a commodity, and so by definition requires speculation and not investment. A bitcoin sitting on the blockchain will not make any more bitcoins. There might be some businesses you can invest in, e.g. pyramining, that will grow your bitcoins, but buying a bitcoin has nothing to do with investing. Mainly it has to do with hedging (QE3 could be announced and thus USD falls) and some speculation. I don't think that there is a lot of that going on, honestly. I think mostly what is happening is wealth storage. Wealth storage can be related to hedging, but people practice it even with no hedging and little return: look at the US treasury bond market for an example.

Every time I run the numbers for these it just never works out. The only scenario where it works is if the price of BitCoin plummets and this is met with a large lowering of the difficulty level. However, when the price dropped into the 2s, the difficulty still stayed high, and as you can imaging, the payout is really poor unless the difficulty drops a lot.
The payback on something like the FPGA X6500 right now is over 18 months. The problem with this is in the next 11 or so months, the distribution rate is going to fall from 50 coins per block to 25 coins, so the payback is really 25 months. This is assuming the difficulty doesn't go up, which it will. There's enough shadow inventory waiting to come back online to get the difficulty back to 1600000 easily.

Obtaining a copy of my password isn't theft. In fact, I don't care if people have a copy of my password. What I care about is if someone uses my password to spend my bitcoins, and that would be theft. That's not copying, it's taking an action that deprives me of the use of my bitcoins. This is similar to a DRM mechanism that locks you out of software that you have paid for.
What I see as a problem with this analogy is that when a person copies a piece of software, they do not deprive someone else of something. Yes, they don't give the money being asked, but no one in the world has any *less* stuff when the copy is made. This is why the whole "you wouldn't download a car" thing is unintentionally funny, because people who think along these lines *would* download a car if it gave them a free car and did not deprive anyone else of a car. But when you steal a car, it leaves someone else carless.
So, when someone copies your keys, it doesn't do anything to you. But when they spend your bitcoins, it deprives you of something.

Both tungsten and gold are non ferrous, and there is only 30-40% tungsten so I'm doubtful a magnetic scan would be helpful. I've read that even a sonic scan wouldn't work on this forgery, but that wasn't backed up well. Additionally, there were papers of certification and the bar had a serial number. The forger somehow acquired a real bar and drilled it out to add the tungsten.
This is a really high quality forgery. The only thing that alerted them was a 0.2% difference in the expected weight by volume. This caused them to cut the bar in half and find the tungsten bars.

[This site]( is an excellent resource for knowing the exchange rate. There is no single rate, but generally mtgoxUSD is the accepted rate by most traders. BitMit uses the 24h weighted price, though.
For 2, to complement to what hazekBTC said, BitMit is the ebay of bitcoins, and the easiest way to sell things. You can even sell US dollar bills for a small premium (one seller sells them for 10% over face). If selling items and you have no history, make sure you use escrow or no one will trust you enough to bid.
Hazeks' response on 3 is good too. Welcome to Bitcoin!

BitCoin doesn't solve this but it could help. The most powerful motivation for a person with a dollar to put it into the hands of these people is inflation. The understanding that it doesn't matter how much you save, you can't just keep it for retirement herds people like lemmings towards these organizations. Although BitCoin is monetarily inflating now (at about 30% per year), within 12 years, the monetary inflation will be well below the Fed target. This will allow people to keep their coins in their control and invest in only the best ideas with the highest return.
Edit: what won't work is appealing to authority and hoping that regulations will come in that solve the problem. There is, quite simply, no part of the government system that is not riddled with corruption. The answer is to vote with your wallets and move your money away from the banksters.

The rest of your post is spot on. I wanted to expand on this point though. No one is right or wrong in the trade but if the European finds they can now find a supplier locally that will give a similar item for less Euros, then rationally they would change to them. This has two effects: first it then feeds back into the exchange rate because less people now want dollars over Euro. Second it puts pressure on theAmerican  to drop his rate, but if European sales aren't important and shipping/duty make him still attractive to American buyers, he  may not change his price. Otherwise, if the European market is important to him, he might put pressure on his suppliers.
One more thing that can occur here that isnt yet available in bitcoins is that the American could have hedged his European risk. Lets say he does $20m in business with Europe annually. He knows that if the Euro/USD market falls he  will have sales suffer. So he might take out long term puts on euro/usd so that if the exchange price does go down he can lower his Euro price and the difference is made up by the increased value of the put. But Bitcoins don't have options yet so there are no hedging options like this.
@_date: 2012-09-19 14:32:12
One more thing, because it's a little unclear from your post, there is a difference between a reloadable prepaid card and a gift card. You should by no means sell a reloadable prepaid card, because this is tied to your SSN and could allow someone to do some bad things with your identity. If it's just a gift card, then no problem. If it is a reloadable prepaid card, then typically you can withdraw cash and you can use this cash for a BitInstant transaction, which would be faster, but has a 4% fee.

Fees are voluntary, so it could occur where everyone has one in there, but right now it's unlikely. In the future, if there are a lot of transactions and miners are hitting the block size limits, then it's likely that everyone will put some fee on. There's a few things that might happen, though. One, the block size limit might be changed. Two, bitcoin might become more of a reserve currency where people don't transact in it much but use it to exchange value between other private (alt) currencies. It's a little early to say either way, though.

As hazek said, it's just not possible to make such a decision in a decentralized way that doesn't introduce more risk than the proof of work system.


This is a good question. Each node can decide which one is first, based on what they saw. This can split the network temporarily as some nodes think one block is right and the other nodes think the other block is right. So some miners are going to be hashing against one block as the "previous block" and other miners are going to be hashing against another. When one miner successfully wins the next block, that makes it so that that chain is longer. The network then rejects or "orphans" the other block.

I'm really not clear on what you mean by the charge. The problem with passing paper wallets is that anyone in the past could at any time clean out the wallet. So there could be 0 "charges" and still all of a sudden the wallet would empty. The only real way to deal with this is by obscuring the private key with some tamper evident mechanism while giving the public key to allow the balance to be checked.
A client can't know how many times someone has checked the balance on an address. And if you are just going to move the coins to another address immediately, it kind of defeats the purpose of exchanging a paper wallet which is to do an offline transaction.

I was thinking about this a little more earlier and something I though of is that you could have the credit union buy futures contracts from people, but writing futures contracts is itself regulated under a whole other set of rules and it's the borrower who needs to write the contract. I know it requires at least capitalization, and I doubt you could do it for common lending use cases such as borrowing money to buy a car with the value of the loan secured by the car. There's really no way I could see forming a housing loan because of the potential for negative amortization.

Except they weren't passing it off as government currency at all.
"He had violated two U.S. Code sections under the umbrella of counterfeiting, they said, and one that amounted to conspiracy against the United States. The U.S. Code specifically prohibits the manufacture of coins intended to be used as money—whether they resemble U.S. coins or not—a charge against which he could scarcely defend himself. But from there, it got hazier. NotHaus was also charged with making coins in resemblance of U.S. coins, basically traditional counterfeiting. Whether the Silver Liberties fit that description is debatable. Prosecutors argued that the coin’s use of “Trust in God” rather than “In God We Trust,” the word “dollar,” and the “$” symbol, among other similarities, were enough. But as beautifully produced as the coins were, the back of them featured a website; few would mistake it for U.S. coinage. Not to mention the fact that he was trumpeting them as competition to Federal Reserve dollars. As NotHaus points out, “If I wanted to be a counterfeiter, I’d be very good at it. This was something different.” And the law says nothing about making paper bills not resembling U.S. money, one reason the government may have decided not to pursue that aspect of his operation. As for the conspiracy charge, prosecutors called NotHaus’s challenge to the Federal Reserve “a unique kind of domestic terrorism.”"

My statements on the depth chart is relative to how it looked at $9. It was way more slanted and the upward pressure was apparent. Now, it's just slight. Of course, I'm being proved wrong today as we have moved through a lot of $12 like butter, but I still think it's several weeks to $15.

The price of bitcoin is not caused by speculation but by more money going into the buy side of transactions than is coming out on the sell side. The cause for this is the sell side having a greater tolerance to lose a little on the transaction because in other payment mechanisms, they would have greater losses (e.g. credit card fees).

No problem, I design applications for a living and I keep up a lot on new design techniques. The big thing now is to never have an error message, because if you have an error message it means your application failed to preverify that the user could take an action. Uswrs take these errors as reprimands when really the system is at fault for allowing the action. At the same time, when controls are disabled,, they need an explanation why and pointers on how to correct (this is if input is needed on that screen first), or to have the control enabled and when the user goes there, you take them directly to how to fix and once it's fixed you continue them to what they were doing.
Investing in this kind of UI for public systems can save millions in support calls ("why am I getting this error?") and retained customers ("this site sucks, it's always giving me errors")

I can't understand the whole fear of the deflationary cycle. It's kind of like the old Babe Ruth quote: no one goes there anymore, it's too crowded. Either the value kept rising is there and so getting into bitcoin now was a good idea, or the value didn't go into a deflationary spiral and it's a good idea to use bitcoins now. But in no way it is an argument to not use bitcoins.
This is all aside from the reality that at each price there will be people who can suddenly afford something they want and they will spend as a result. You can't have every person with a bitcoin be a millionaire without some people cashing out.

In my opinion, its certainly true that people are buying to hold. The trigger is that we were able to recover from the crash of 2011. Now that this has been fully established, money has started to flow back in.
However, I have to temper this with the fact that commerce in bitcoin has never been this easy. In 2011, I spent at most $100. In 2012, my running tally is closer to $12,000.

The orders for the first day are at most about 16TH. It could be less, but given the sales figures released by bitinstant and considering that some orders may have been by bankwire, 16TH is pretty much the upper bound. More likely it is 12TH. 
There are several estimates out there that there is about 200TH on order right now. I really haven't checked this work too thoroughly, though.
As far as overall, well, this actually depends more on the price of bitcoin than anything else. If there is a profit margin, miners will buy more hardware until it isn't profitable anymore. At this point, that could mean 100x or 2,000TH, but the higher the bitcoin price goes, the higher that number is.

The blockchain is only important to make a consensus on the order of messages, and the order arrived at by the consensus isn't even necessarily the order the sender puts them on the network (see Finney attack). It is this ordering that is crucial to determining when and to whom a bitcoin is spent. I don't see this as being necessary or even advantageous for an asynchronous messaging system.

It helps to illustrate it at the same time. Open up [Blockchain Info]( in another window beside this one, and read the rest of my post.
You can probably see on the bottom transactions popping up. These are people desiring to spend bitcoins. In your client, this is when it says "0 confirmations." That's because the transaction isn't in a block yet. Now look at the top and you'll see a listing of blocks. If you sit there for long enough (on average about 10 minutes, but it can take over an hour), you'll see a new one appear. Click on one of the block links, where the block number is listed. In there, you'll see some information about the block at the top, and under it a list of transactions (or maybe just one transaction).
What happened was a miner got some of those floating 0 confirmation transactions and packaged them together into a block. Then they ran a function on it. If you look at the top information of the block, you'll see a thing that says "nonce". They were changing this number each time they ran the function. If you see the thing that says "hash", what they were looking for was that function to return this hash less than a certain number. That's why the hash has so many 0s in front of it.
By doing this, it implements what is called a "proof of work" system. This distributes the trust that the people who are finding these numbers are not all the same person attempting to do bad things to the network. Another thing to know is that all of these blocks are chained. This means the farther back you go in blocks, the more likely it is that different people have worked on that set of blocks. This makes it so that blocks farther in the past are more trusted. In addition, it is also more trusted that someone can't come along and start solving blocks far in the past in the chain, because it's unlikely that they would be able to solve them fast enough to overtake the "main chain" that everyone is working on.
This creates the trust in bitcoin that the transactions are ordered even though the ordering was done by unknown parties. By knowing the order of transactions, you can verify if an address has enough coins to actually make a transaction.

I think it's unfair to fracture up bitcoin's features and then individually compare them to something else. bitcoin has a whole set of features that when put together as a whole make it a great technology.
One thing on the topic of payment, bitcoin is not for people buying things, it's for people selling things. A buyer would much rather have Paypal and the protection of a credit card, but a seller would much rather not have to deal with false charge backs and third party asset seizure. So it's not surprising that you don't see an advantage there. However I do and so I will be accepting bitcoin for some seasonal services I provide this summer that I normally only accept money orders for.
A lot of the other concerns you have are just part of the fact that bitcoin is a new technology and system. As it matures, the ease of use will increase, the market will deepen, and the price might stabilize.

Mining is the process of ordering transactions into the ledger (called the blockchain). It uses a proof of work system whereby miners are attempting to discover a hash of set of data to be below a certain number. Miners validate the blocks behind them and form new valid blocks. Once a blocks is accepted, then miners after that will validate that block as well. With the ability to create blocks dependent on computing resources, trust is introduced into the system as no individuals can take over the network to introduce bad data or erase old data.
On any given [block]( in the chain, you will see a [transaction]( that generates coins to an address. The bitcoin network is built on the understanding that this will occur and so treats this a valid. The new coins, plus any fees collected, are most likely going to the miner who is solving the hash to be below the special number. Because that miner's bitcoin address is in that transaction, and miners decide what transactions to include, their solution is also unique to that miner.
The bitcoins aren't free because you are doing work needed by the network to get them. The number of bitcoins you get for the work is known, and the total average number of bitcoins you can get this way over time is fixed, so when more miners and more computing power come online, it is all competing for a fixed supply coins, making each increase in computing power correspond to an increase in difficulty for all miners. This is accomplished by the network seeing how long it took for 2016 blocks to be generated, and then adjusting the number that the hash needs to be less than so that the amount of computing power for that 2016 blocks would equal 14 days. This does allow for some temporary gains by introducing new hardware, but after 2016 blocks, the advantage is adjusted out by this process.
None of this really relates to the value of bitcoins, however. In the beginning, people mined for months without getting anything but worthless bitcoins. The value from the bitcoins comes from their current and speculated future worth in trade.

At this price/difficulty, I can still mine with my existing hardware with half the reward, but I can't justify buying more hardware (especially dedicated hardware like an ASIC).

Difficulty will only rise if there is a capital incentive to add more hardware. If it costs $5 in electricity to make a bitcoin, then it's still worth mining them. GPU mining was in a similar position a few months ago, with it costing up to $3/bitcoin while the price was around $5-6. If the price of a bitcoin goes up, then even $10/bitcoin will have people mining.
I personally do mine, and even when I was straddling profitability (meaning my electricity costs were very close to the price of bitcoin), I just mined through it. First of all, it was still a good way of converting money into bitcoin. Second of all, I believe in bitcoin and would even take a slight loss to keep the network going.

It's actually a stocastic process, and even this isn't predicable in the traditional sense. It is possible that miners pull out in droves to mine another currency. If this happens, then bitcoin could be stuck without issuing a coin for years.
@_date: 2012-08-07 13:21:01
Agreed. What will happen is that miners will have a threshold of transaction fees that will cause them to start mining. So, if a block only has enough reward + transaction fees to add up to 10 coins and bitcoin is at $10, then a person who averages $10.01 to mine a block will not start mining until one more cent worth of transactions can be added to the block. This, of course, makes you dependent on your electricity costs.

I've been reading some of the responses on there. I think it's important to tie bitcoin to features of gold and not to features of fiat, because Austrians don't consider fiat to be money either. 
But I don't know if it really makes sense to take a stand on if "Bitcoin is money." I've read that phrase so much, it's started to lose meaning for me. I liked A.J.'s response so much that I sent him a donation.
"Bitcoin is not money; it is a public ledger system keeping track of who was deemed by whom to provide a good or service the latter person valued. It is an extrapolation of "Oh you made dinner two nights in a row? We'll all remember that and fill in for you later" on steroids, enabled by modern technology. Bitcoin obviates the need for money, but it is not itself money, not a medium of exchange. Actual bitcoins are just dummy tokens to facilitate the accounting process in the public ledger system. The marketing that these tokens are "money," which is just a simplification for the masses, has been taken as fact by Austrians who correctly reject bitcoins as money without investigating what Bitcoin (the protocol and system) actually *is* so that they can evaluate it on its own merits - not as money but as an entirely new way of transacting."
This makes it so that after the critique "Bitcoin isn't money?" you can just say "that isn't important, it still has value."

The purpose of a credit union is to pool money together and then loan it out at a profit to members. When you are part of a credit union, you don't get a fixed rate interest payment each month, but instead a dividend based on the interest gathered minus defaults over that period. An advantage is that the credit union managers would be, presumably, skilled in finding and vetting potential borrowers.
The problem I see is that to be legal, the loans would need to be in fiat, which historically performs poorly against holding bitcoin. I'm not really seeing this happen, and if it did, I doubt I would participate.

This is kind of tricky, but it can be the case that your client debits your account but the address actually has the extra bitcoin in it. If you take all your receiving address, look them up one by one, look at the totals for them, add them up, and it is less than the amount in the client, then they are still yours. I'm not sure how to get it back though.

it's only worth running one miner per mining device. I have a machine with 3 video cards in it and I used to run 3 miners. Now I use cgminer which has all the devices in one miner, but even there I split it up a bit because if the program halts then I don't have all my miners idle.
I can't endorse BTCOxygen over bitcoinpool yet. I just saw them and put some hashing towards them to test them out. I will say that with respect to 0% fee pools like bitcoinpool, the problem I've had in the past is their uptime. I've switch to pools like it before and they had 95% uptime or less. Another thing that kind of bothers me about bitcoinpool is that it isn't easy to see their PPS rate, but maybe you have to log in.

I was very curious, so I typed into a spreadsheet every single trade from the downtick from 7.25 to when it stopped. I might have transcribed a few wrong here or there, but basically it came to 5032.4940 or close to 5000 btc (the extra you could count as someone else selling at the time). You can also see a 10,000 btc sell pop up at 7.10 after which seems to be the same person.
It does appear to me to be someone doing a market sale of 5,000 bitcoin, but it's hard to say. They might have done a limit sale of 7.00, but it actually doesn't get to 7.00, there's still an ask of about 136 btc at 7.0001 when the trade finishes.

Yeah, it makes sense. You would probably want your bitcoin client to have the SSL key (actually, this term is wrong as SSL is a socket layer, but I know what you mean) in it and any time it creates a new address, especially for change, it would automatically sign it into the database.

I agree that we recovered from 1929, and no matter what, we'll recover from this. But let's inject some skepticism. We were able to recover from the 1929 collapse because of an industrialization monopoly brought about by the destruction in Europe in the second world war, made cheap because of access to high EROEI petroleum. And even that took 15 years to recover (1929 - 1944). Meanwhile, people are trying to emulate that recovery through misguided sovereign debt issuance. Europe imploding ot no, we are already facing an [end to growth as we know it]( which means a new system will be needed.
I also agree that bitcoin is not a cure to all economic issues. But it does have a nice feature in that it is capped on the number of bitcoin that can exist. This lack of monetary inflation adds some features to the currency that FRNs don't have. People will be able to individually save for retirement because they won't have to worry about inflation eating their saving. It also will return lending to a market driven activity, instead of manipulated by the fed. This won't prevent negative things from happening, but it can reduce the impact of the shocks.

A specific examples of non-speculative investments are:  
- a loan to an individual with established income and good credit   
- purchase of an equity for a company with good forward P/E *that you have performed good due diligence on*  
- venture capital to a start-up with a solid business plan
It's not that there isn't risk, there is always risk of a default, or a bad economy destroying future profits, or the start up failing. The difference is putting money towards growth of the underlying business. 
The contrast is putting money towards the growth of the security itself. And to this end, in the middle action, buying the equity could actually be speculation instead of investment when a person has no understanding of the business and why there is potential for the future profits. You can have two separate people both buying Apple in 2006 and one is a speculator and the other an investor. It's because the reasons for buying matter.

A large number of bitcoins are traded on exchanges right now, so it is easy to refer to Mt Gox for an agreed value, and that is what is typically done. However, if the exchanges didn't exist, value could still be determined by other means and in fact was determined in these ways before Mt Gox started bitcoin trading.
Let's say that the bitcointalk currency exchange forum was the only place that people could trade bitcoins, and everything was person to person transactions. If you wanted to buy some bitcoins, you might scan the existing posts and see if there was someone selling for a price you liked and you would contact them. But if there wasn't, you might put up a post with a lower price you did like offering to buy. But you would probably base this on the other buy posts in the forum because if you went too low, you would know that no one would respond.
Similar price finding can be done with localbitcoins.com. In fact, when dealing with trade other than for dollars, this kind of price finding occurs all the time in the marketplace forums.

Oh god, I'm reminded of a scene from Office Space. Knowing a thing or two about money laundering (infosec is part of my job at a major bank), the main goal is to legitimize illegally gained money. Bitcoin is horrible at this because  
- it is only pseudo anonymous, with the entire transaction register visible to the public  
- the volume is too low to prevent analysis  
- there are too few legitimate business transactions to hide large amounts of illicit activity
So to this end, I would say that bitcoin could be used for some small time money laundering, but is hardly the ultimate tool for it. *The* ultimate tool for money laundering are collectables like coins of numismatic value.

Ok, this is some good detail: you want help with mining. 
What pool should you mine for is a kind of personal preference. I'm currently on [BTCOxygen]( because their fees are low. I'm using [Oz]( as a backup. The main/backup thing is just so that if one goes down, then cgminer will try to contact the next one and mine there. This helps prevent your workers from going idle if there is a problem with the pool.
So, let's just say you use those. You would go to their website and make a new account. Let's say it's called bawchicawawa. Once that is done, on each of them you need to make a "worker". This is just a unit of accounting that you mine against. If you have multiple cards, you may want to make one worker for each one. Let's just make one worker and call it "worker1" with password as "password1". The worker's full name is actually bawchicawawa.worker1. *Different pools might do things differently, but most pools I've been on are exactly like this*. Also note that password1 is not your pool password to your account. This is mostly just a crap easy password, unless you are worried about people mining into your worker and giving you free money.
Now you start cgminer:
    cgminer -o  -O bawchicawawa.worker1:password1 -o  -O bawchicawawa.worker1:password1
So where did I get the urls  and  They are on the websites somewhere, usually in a setup FAQ. You can just copy and paste this while in the cgminer directory and you should start seeing messages that look like

Kind of yes. First off, I'm just giving probabilities here given the information that is present in the market at this point in time. It could shoot down to $2 again, it's a risk. But right now, my strong feeling is buy. Even if it goes down into the low $10s, hold because you are still more likely to make money buying now at $11.
As a side note, a random person cannot come out of nowhere and erect an ask wall at $11.25. To do so, they would need to have the coin inventory to support this. Yes, there are people who have such a coin inventory, but there are surprisingly few candidates. There are at most 960 people in the world who can put up a 10,000 bitcoin sell wall. There are hundreds of thousands who could do the same on the buy side.
As for why the run up, there are a lot of factors: speculation regarding the reward drop, increased good non-drug related news with the shining example of bit-pay transacting $250k in a single day, recovery from the march fall including surpassing our peak market capitalization. The list of positives right now are good, while at the same time the fiat world is going to hell.
Edit: one more note on those ask walls, they do appear, but they tend to [evaporate]( Many of them are put up to try to capitalize on flash events, like someone misunderstanding the order book and placing a large market order.

This is going to be a real bad deal for your dad. You probably won't have to do this exercise for a month to start showing a profit. 
To do this, you should fake a preorder today. Just go onto BFLs site and go through the steps of purchasing a Jalapeno using Bitcoin and then when you get to the page where you are supposed to send the coins, note the order number. Then you would need to go onto the bitcointalk forum and see what people are saying as far as receiving their orders. If you see a person say they got a Jalapeno with a higher order number, take that as your start date.
Every two weeks or so, you'll need to get the difficulty from [here]( Then you can use [this calculator]( to calculate your bitcoins. You really should also track on [blockchain.info]( the actual start and stop time for that difficulty and apply your earning rate to that. I also think that you should take away 5% to account for pool fees and random downtime. Keep all of this in a spreadsheet. You should also take away 16% of what you earn for FICA (federal taxes for social security).
After 3 years or so, you'll find that your earning are tapered off to very little and you might stop then and try to cash out with your dad. Maybe my parents were crappy, but I know mine would welch on this deal at that time. If you can, get it in writing from your dad that he will do this. But also understand that parents have serious expenses and they aren't necessarily gong to be able to pull a few thousand out of nowhere all of a sudden. A compromise might be that they will pay that amount of your college tuition as loan payments once you graduate.

Agreed on net neutrality. People don't realize that this is just a lever to get acceptance of the government regulating the internet. Once it is providing the blanket of net neutrality, it becomes easier to justify additional controls to support the initial one. It may sound far fetched, but so does the idea that providing funds for an interconnected highway would lead to each state uniformly increasing the drinking age to 21.

No, you have to think more abstractly. The analogy is just that miner earnings halve. The only real way to relate this to a nonbitcoin audience is to say the price of gold halves, but that's not really what happens .He could have said that the amount of gold being mined all around the world suddenly falls off, but that's a little unwieldy for a throwaway statement.

There are many reasons why bitcoin is preferable to cash. In fact, you could set up an Open Transactions server that would allow for the exchange of bitcoins for co-ordinates to the living hostage. Add that to a web of trust, and the kidnapper effectively can prove that the exchange will go as agreed with the person alive. With enough kidnapping reputation, this would convince spooked parents to not even bother involving authorities because it would add more risk.

I agree but I'm a libertarian so I agree with no laws in general. I however am undecided on liability if you do spend the coins. I still believe that, morally speaking, you are entitled to the results of your labor and that account might be someone's retirement savings. So, again morally speaking, it is a wrong spend coins because you happened to stumble across a key.
Edit: There are wallets that generate keys in sequence based on a passphrase. If you have a weak phrase, this could be compromised in this way.

Bitcoins are highly liquid, if you're willing to verify your identity with one of the major exchanges. You could convert ฿10,000 to about $130,000 in a few seconds if you wanted to on Mt Gox right now. In my experience, they are very liquid if your preference is to sell them p2p. If you are selling a small amount of bitcoin (under $1,000 worth) and you are willing to put some leg work, you can find a buyer in little time. I have an established reputation, though, so this helps me find buyers.
There are absolutely people treat bitcoin as an investment. I treat bitcoin as an investment, and I think that people really should put about 5% of their retirement savings into bitcoin. The growth potential is much higher than you are saying. The price has doubled in the last 5 months. I'm not saying this will happen again in the next 5 months, but it could. In the next 10 years, if bitcoin gains mainstream traction, then we could be looking at $1000 coins. With this much upside, a small portion of your savings is not a big gamble to take.
The safegaurds i discuss below, but the key thing is that there are scammers out there. You need to learn to be a little cynical of every deal and use escrow where appropriate. BitMit has escrow on all orders when a seller starts off. There's no way to reverse a transaction, and you need to conduct yourself as such.
As much as that seems like a pain in the ass, this actually leads to some good thngs. You see, all that transaction reversibility was leading to goods and services providers getting scammed. Sometimes they weren't even getting scammed, just hit hard by fees from chargebacks that were only put against them because scammers were testing low values on credit cards against their site. The amount of credit card fraud out there, combined with credit card processing fees, seriously is eating into a lot of people's bottom line. So the good thing is that when they offer they stuff in bitcoin, they often give a good discount. Also, somethings have payment risk and wouldn't even be offered without bitcoin. Any time one of these things occurs, a little bit of value is added into the currency.

No problem. Let's address these in order.


If you click on any block, you're going to see a transaction that looks like [this]( It says "No Input (Newly Generated Coins)". This is put there by the miner. the reason that it is there is because it is allowed to be there. Everyone using bitcoins knows this is going to happen, so that's how the miner gets those coins.
You might notice that in that transaction, the amount is not exactly 25, but is actually 25.0512. The extra .0512 is the transaction fees. So where did those come from? They come from the other transactions in the block. For example, in [this transaction]( the total input was 0.47874995 and the total output was 0.47774995 (0.34365965 to one address, and 0.13409030 to another). That .001 difference went nowhere. This signals to miners that this .001 is available to them to add to the 25 bitcoins if they include that transaction in the block.


A block is a packaging of regular transactions plus the single no input transaction.


No, not necessarily. It's the choice of the miner to include a transaction or not. If you have a fee, then it's likely a miner will pick up the transaction. However, if there is no fee, it might be passed up a few times. There is also a block size limit, so giving a low fee when there are other higher fee transactions around might have your transaction sit as well.


I'm not sure I understand this question. Past blocks have transactions in the past that were included at that time. In addition, the most recent past block is chained to the current block that the miner is working on.

I can see how it can become viral because of the use of email to send/receive. I use the first account to send a get request to a second email address of mine, and it was pretty clear how to get into the new second account. However, when I went to send the .01 btc from the second account, I got an error message saying I had no coins and that I needed to go to a different part of the system to fund my account.
Why can't this be more seamless and bring you through the process. As the second person, I don't want to have to learn your site and fund my wallet and then come back in and send the coin again. I want to get clear instructions on how to fund my account and when those funds clear with you, they should automatically go to the first account. Easy flow, no error messages, no learning.

I think the weakness has to be to ECDSA, not SHA-2. A weakness in SHA-2 would allow you to mine faster and thus potentially disrupt the blockchain, but it wouldn't let you authenticate ownership of coins. To do that, you need to use the ECDSA public key to find the private key.

WalletBit is an ecommerce solution for vendors. they offer automatic translation to fiat, but there is a 15gbp minimum charge each time they do the transfer.

This isn't just an exchange, though, the ecommerce solution also does the payment integration and they have a bunch of plugins for many different shopping carts. That without the translation is .89%, which is better than BitPay's .99%.

I think this is fine if you want to just test out mining, but don't have any intention of making any money. If you are intending to really get into mining, then all I could really suggest is to preorder one of the ASIC usb devices and use that when it arrives. Right now, if you were to get a video card, I don't feel it would be able to justify the expense because at the end of this month, the block reward drops from 50 to 25.

You need about 266 GHps to generate 50 bitcoins in 8 hours. A CPU mines about 1MHps, so you would need 280,000 computers. To do it with 20 computers, you would need a card that does 13 GHps, which to my knowledge does not exist. Even with a 5 port motherboard and 5 mining cards, I doubt it could be done.

And reddit really needs a good marketing department to sell their ad space. They should be contextualizing ads based on subreddit or at least allow advertisers to do the same. This is the only Bitcoin forum that doesn't have ASIC ads plastered all over it, and it just doesn't make any sense.

Hashing power increasing. That was assuming the dollar value stays the same (which isn't certain, but I generally feel it's going up). The next generation of miners are ASIC chips, and ASICMINER, a company that is developing these chips for the purpose of using them in house to mine, has announced that they are less than a week away from their chips being sent to packaging. This will only be a 6TH shipment, but they have another shipment like this two weeks behind that, and have a goal of 50TH. Meanwhile, there are indications that Avalon will be shipping 20TH in January and bASIC has another 7.2TH and BFL has 150TH due sometime in 1Q2013. At 227THps, that's 10x the current network rate.

People live with that on currency exchanges because they have to. If you can just trade on the decentralized exchange, why would you deal with a worse price.

If you're talking about transfers to SilkRoad, it is useless because SR does tumbling on the coins and transferring money to SR isn't explicitly illegal: there are some legal things to purchase on there.
But when doing a local bitcoin trade, you are the one who is in control of what info you give out. If you use a tormail email address to do all communication and proxy your bitcoin transfer, then the person you meet won't know who you are at all. I sell coins locally and I wouldn't care one bit as long as the cash is green.

Bitfloor and BitInstant aren't really in the same category. Bitfloor is an exchange, where people with coins and people with cash loaded in their account bid and sell against each other. When you go to [Bitfloor]( you can see the last price it traded at at the bottom of the page. Right now, it seem to be 8.59, which is very cheap because the biggest exchange, Mt Gox, is selling them for around 8.90. The trouble is that you need to load te cash into your account, which could take a few days.
BitInstant is a buying service. Where exchanges match up buyers and sellers, a buying service has an inventory of bitcoins that they sell. These typically have a little markup, so the price on the BitInstant site is going to have the cost built in, but you can see on their page they are up front about the 3.99% commission. Their prices are relative to Mt Gox, so that's why the charge is so high. It's really only worth it if you think you need the coins immediately. Otherwise, I would send a check to bitfloor.

I understand it just fine. The problems are still there. Either the trades happen solely on the exchange within a time window and the price deviates from the decentralized network, or the trades try to fulfill on the exchange and if the decentralizes network gives a better fulfillment, then the trade goes out on the network, which can lead to the DoS if you allow trading to cycle before network resolution.

This seems fine for sellers, but a common scam is sending bitcoins and never receiving a product. With the threat of the bitcoins going to a bitbucket, the buyer might become desperate and resolve the situation for a small token of the original offer.

This actually happened in the wake of the recent crash. As the price went down, my break even price was $4, but by the time it got to $4, the difficulty was down, and my break even was $3. All the way down to $2, I could see that others were dropping out and I was just barely profitable. I did catch some luck in that I kept all the coins I mined at that time up to $6.30 where I made a purchase with them.

Bitcoin is not intellectual property like a piece of software, but it might be intellectual property like the JPEG specification. However, the rights are in the public domain so that anyone can implement their own software to the specification. You have the "right" to crack Bitcoin for your own use and/or profit. In fact, I'll bet that there are people right now working on a way to marginally increase the time to find a nonce. If they could just get a 10% improvement, this could potentially be worth thousands of dollars.

The problem I have with it is that he essentially set up a hedge mechanism that many pirate depositors joined into in the hopes that, if they didn't get their funds from pirate, they would at least get something from Matthew. This has two significant negative effects: 
- it delays them in taking actions with respect to their pirate "investment" because they feel they are hedged, and this could lead to actual loss. There were people buying pirate debt for 9% and someone might have taken this deal if they didn't have protection of this debt.  
- Possibly worse, the reneg would put these people through the same emotional turmoil that pirate had just put them through. Being fooled once is bad enough, but then to be taken in by a second person so soon afterwards can easily magnify the embarrassment and self hate one goes through when realizing they have been duped.
Outside of the special case of pirate scammees hedging, there are ethical problems with welchers. It's just that the relationship to the scam makes the whole affair very unpalatable to me.

Yes, you are mining. If you're in a PPS pool, then every line that says ACCEPTED is a share that pays your PPS amount.
[BTCOxygen]( is a new pool that pays a good PPS rate. They have a 2% fee, which seems high, but with PPS the pool will actually lose at least 1% to staleness caused by network lag when submitting a block, so IMO it's worth joining. Other PPS pools charge upwards of 4% because of the stale issue.

On additional thing is that new chips are coming out that cut the mining costs in a quarter. This could drop the cost to 4 million, but it also might just have the effect of having the honest network getting more power.
If I were the government and wanted to attack bitcoin, I would invest the money in making new bitcoin specific chips (ASICS, etc), and then blow the network away that way. I can't say that this is impossible, and for all we know the NSA has already done this and has their finger on a button waiting for an order. It doesn't seem likely to me, though.

I do think bitcoins will become widespread, but it will take time. This is kind of like being on the internet when NCSA mosaic first came out. Things were pretty shitty for 3 years until real companies started figuring out what to do and how to use the technology. We didn't even have SSL until 1994 which mirrors some of the security issues we are seeing now.
Widespread adoption will drive the price up, way higher than it is now. I agree with other posters here that the price will probably drop another $1-$2, but if you were to buy and hold at this level, I think you would still do well in a few years.

I've seen them too, but to be honest, it is doubtful that these were real and not just a scam. This is, of course, the issue with these kinds of markets: killing services aren't cheap and sending bitcoins blindly to someone over the internet gives you little recourse. Real world transactions of this kind tend to be based on some level of trust by recommendation.
Then on the other side, if an assassin really did get a reputation on the internet for being an effective killer, the cops would probably try to stage something to catch them.

Let's say you have a cookie jar that every night might have cookies put into it or taken out of it by Santa. You never know how many cookies he will put in or taken out, and it depends on Santa's mood. At any point in time, if you want to keep the cookies you have, you can lock the jar. After you do this, Santa will never add or take away any cookies, and you can enjoy your cookies at your leisure.
Let's say you have a lot of cookies in the jar, more than you need, but you want to try and get some more from Santa. But, you know that sometimes when Santa gets hungry, he can start eating a lot of cookies. So you get a robot that will constantly count the cookies, and if it gets to a level that you cannot bear to have less cookies than, then the robot will lock Santa out of the jar for you.

Personally, I'm strattling it. Merged mining is the only reason I'm still in the black, and truthfully my ROI is in the can. When you take out what I have already earned when prices were higher and I sold then, I'm close to a 60 month ROI. At this point it would make sense for me to part out the pieces and sell them (I'm more likely to get more money that way), but I am a supporter of the idea of bitcoin, so I'll keep it running.

No, I don't think so. The government leaning on the bit poker sites for accepting what amounted to bank transfers did help bitcoin out (I know because it was a motivator for me to get into it, and I know other poker people who felt the same way). But all this does is bring scandal to poker, and a bitcoin poker site operator can (and has) done the same thing. In fact, since there's no standards of accounting and a layer of anonymity, you could say that this is even more able to happen in a bitcoin place.

It's funny how you mention the bill settling thing, because that was the touted first use case of paypal back in 2000. Articles at the time talked about silicon valley techies doing just that.
One thing I don't care for is the value argument. You really can't say you can use bitcoin as a store of value right now. Maybe that's coming soon, but the price swings are too wild for it. As far as I'm concerned, it is still just a transfer mechanism. I'm keeping a few bitcoin as a hedge, but I've liquidated most of my stuff (in the 15 to 11 range), and then used the rest for transferring money (I lent some guy some cash with it, for example).
One thing you can do with bitcoin is accept payment anonymously for items that might be risky to sell. It's not just about strictly illegal items like drugs, but [homemade foods that do not conform to regulation](

I really hate this tendency for BitCoin press to equate the exchange rate with the viability. The high prices earlier this year were driven by rampant speculation: it was like a country of people buying 3 condos each to flip before close and expecting the value to continue to stay up.
The only reason exchange rate matters is because it is a factor in determining the network capacity, and the rate is and has been high enough to sustain the network the entire time. As long as people can still exchange dollars into bitcoin and as long as people still want to transact in bitcoin, there will be bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-09-14 16:56:06
I agree with you and I don't. It is technically fragile to a rich troll or a government who is against it on principle, but like you said you would need someone with motivation. The financial motivation is not there because if you were to take over the network, the value of bitcoins would evaporate (see what happened to SC as an example) and you would have control of 7m bits of useless currency. You wouldn't be able to sell off your ill gotten btc quickly enough.
The other things is that this amount generally scales with value. This means that when bitcoins are worth $100 each, then the network will support about $260m worth of hardware. This is because of an economic equilibrium between btc value, cost of a Mphs, and difficulty. So, as motivation goes up, so does hardware costs.
tl;dr technically fragile, but practically all right.

I happen to be exactly at $4 with the current difficulty, my electricity prices, and my biggest rig setup, so I know what you are saying. But the rate of 7200 btc/day is held as miners drop out [](/ "unless there is a mass exodus"). As people quit mining, difficulty goes down. There's even a further feedback as when difficulty goes down the cost to mine goes down (actually, the yeild goes up, so a lower btc price becomes acceptable).

First presentation focuses on the technology, second on the human factors.

I think it is a little far fetched as well, but something to consider is that bitcoins are already worth trillions of zimbabwe dollars.
If it did come to a point where bitcoins were worth what we think of as 5 million dollars in value, then people obviously wouldn't be buying/selling them in 1 btc denominations. They would be buying and selling satoshis for about 50 cents. Probably by then we would have upgraded to a client that supports more than 8 decimals as well.

You can't take the volume as a direct indicator because of trade-botting. A lot of it is very short term buy-sells.
The other stuff you said is very important, though, and I don't think a lot of people get it. That rate ($7200/day vs $72000/day) is really what the bitcoin economy wishes to bear as a cost of maintaining the system. I keep meaning to write a detailed post about it, but don't have the time.

After trading stocks for a few years, I have come to the conclusion that it never matters what the market thinks. This is really generalized, but the tendancy is for the market to trend optimistically and sometimes it is shown wrong and the value falls, but other times it's shown right but by then it is too late to get in. Not really related to bitcoin, just my philosophy on that particular phrase.
@_date: 2011-09-13 14:03:17
Generally, it sounds like a good idea. Some things:  
- I don't see why it would need to be a central set of wallets. Instead each citizen could have their own address and get sent their coin for each election.  
- You would need multiple coins types because each election is not just for one person. For example, it might be the president, a senator, a congressperson, a govenor, a few state officials, a mayor, a few judges, and a city councilperson. Then there are also state ballot initiatives. Each thing you can vote on would need a diferent coin type because you wouldn't want someone to use their judge vote to give the presidential candidate more votes.  
- this still doesn't make things "secure" because things can be changed at the point of the polling booth. Selecting candidate A might still send the coin to candidate B. Because the voter doesn't control the machine, they really don't know what they are voting. I tend to prefer systems that print a summary of the votes which the voter approves and then drops the summary into a collection area for validation later if there is any question of vote tampering.

The problem is that when dealing with things with respect to law, lay people generally have little idea on what is good work and what is bad, and if this is simply giving advice, then it's also hard to know what really worked for someone and what ended up getting the person in hot water.
I've used internet pseudononymous legal sites before and personally I didn't find them to be helpful. I used one that had confirmed lawyers with names and where they practiced and one response was unhelpful but the other was actually very helpful and with their advice I was able to get a case closed.

Presently the network hashing rate is about 13000 GH/s. Typical builds are about $1 per Mhps, so to make a set of computers that can do this, you would need about $13 million. This doesn't take into consideration other infrastructure you would need, like the a/c wiring (it would be much cheaper to do a lot of it in d/c, actually).
The power requirements would be pretty staggaring. Using an average of 0.6 Watts / MHps, you would need 7.8 MW of power.

This purely depends on if we can get a side economy going before a crackdown. If game developers make games on the side which take bitcoins that they can use to pay for drugs and the drug dealers buy home made preserves from a canner who likes to play online games, then there's no reason that bitcoin needs to trade to state currencies. 
Right now there isn't enough cyclical trade and so generally transactions go along the lines of one person buying bitcoins to send to another person who then sells them for money.

I think there are serious problems in trying to apply this in this case. Everyone who uses namecoins should know that this attack is possible so they have assumed the risk of an attack.
Namecoins aren't a thing, they aren't really owned by anyone, nor are they legal tender, so there really isn't anything protecting against "counterfeit" namecoins. The point of a cryptocurrency was to have it where we didn't need a central government to protect the currency.
I think this is a good experiment, and it also answers the question of whether bitcoin will retain traction or will succumb to another cryptocurrency. If a small fraction of computing resources can be redirected to screw a new cc, then those ccs shouldn't exist (ixcoin, iocoin, etc).

With something like this, you have to present it in a way that it makes management think it was their idea and they can take all the credit.

Now, it would be hard to present these articles without seeming defensive, but you could bring them to him and say "I apologize for what I talked about in the meeting. I saw these articles and I thought they were real. I wasn't trying to waste anyone's time, I just made a mistake.

Short answer: yes, you have to be online.
Long answer: you need to know when other people have solved a block so you can start on the next one, and you need to throw out all your old work, collect a new set of transactions to work on, and use the info from the last block in your new header. Since a new block comes along every 10 minutes or so, but could take 1 minute, you really have to be online. Also, it's common to pool mine, and in pool mining, you're submitting partial solutions (called shares) every second.

Em, no, because that you be using the existing goodwill towards gold into a new form because no one cares about the form gold is in. Making Ixcoin and axcoins or whatever does not copy the goodwill towards bitcoin.
Note, this assumes that Canadian gold coins are not sold at or near spot. If a $50 coin has only $5 of gold in it, and the other country has a $40 coin with $6 of gold in it, then it would be a similar process, but I fail to see how it is relevant or even refutes the point. The $50 coin has $50 in value because of the goodwill towards the Canadian currency to retain value. The $40 Zimbabwe coin might have more gold in it, but you can almost be sure that it will be only worth $6 in a few years.

It's a little unclear to me on how you are making 5x your salary. is this just from holding coins or are you doing things like selling goods and services?
If it's from holding, you should not quit. People don't quit their jobs when they get some savings, they keep those savings for a future purpose (retirement, home ownership, possible medical bills).

realistically, what should happen is that at the time it crosses the threshold where the GOOG share is worth the same, you would trade back the .000001 btc back to the share holder for your GOOG share. If it's done at the point in time where the value is equal, then it's a fair trade. If you really want the coin instead, you can sell the GOOG share and buy an uncolored coin.

I don't get these kinds of statements. Being a currency is very basic and bitcoin easily fits the definition. It is just something that is *currently* used to facilitate trade by acting as a temporary store of value in a market. Diablo 3 gold is a currency. I play this trading card game (and these in game items called Holy Powder act as a currency for trading cards. The fact that people will price and trade in a unit makes that unit a currency. We don't need to force terms like "meta-currency" when you can go to BitMit or Bitcoin Store and buy stuff.
As for pop-Austrianism, I'm not fully sold on everything the school says, but a lot of things they do say make a lot of sense. My biggest quibble with their core philosophy is that game theory has proven that individuals acting in their best interest can lead to not making the socially most efficient choice. However, I don't feel this invalidates the claims, just tempers them.
But aside from all that, bitcoin is the most impressive technology I've grokked in a long time.

The thing is that even assuming all the vendors have their setting to 100% fiat conversion, while what you see is a bunch of coins being sold, on the other side of it you have a bunch of coins being bought to be sent to bitpay. Some of this will be from miners, but by and large you are going to have a bunch of people buying coins and then using those coins for services. To do this, the price will need to float at a certain level, based on the supply of coins on exchanges in order to support the transactions.

Generally people keep buying hardware until their 100% ROI hits the 6-8 month mark, and then the hashrate only trickles higher. So when a Jalapeno would pay itself off in 4 days, people will buy them. Of course a Jalapeno bought today will arrive when it really takes 1.5 months to pay itself off, but that's still good enough to convince people to buy.
At the 6 month mark, it slows down and the reason is risk. There's actually two kinds of risk at this point. The first is obvious: Bitcoin could crash to 0 and you are stuck with this useless hardware. The second is not so obvious but is actually important: the opportunity cost of not buying and holding some bitcoin. The miner might have a 250% annual ROI, but bitcoins had a 400% annual ROI, so holding is far better. This is often stated as the problem that if you spend X bitcoins on a miner, it is extremely unlikely that you will never mine X bitcoins out. In dollar terms, you make a profit, though. This scenario plays out when bitcoin price rises dramatically.
Personally, I feel that mining is a hedge against price stability. Keep half of your bitcoin funds in miners and the other half in coins. Then when the price goes up, you make money on the coins. When the price is stable, you make money on the miners.

Cryptocurrencies in general won't die because they create a few markets that never existed before. 
First the pseudonymity creates the well known black markets where identity scrubbing is important to the seller, but also markets where identity scrubbing is important to the customer (VPNs, blog services for dissidents, etc). 
Second, the lack of redemption creates a market where trust is imputed on the buyer whereas with credit cards we have only had a market where trust is imputed on the seller. This is important in a lot of business spaces, like the sale of virtual items, where purchasers are generally anonymous and untraceable but may be committing fraud or pretending to commit fraud to get goods and services for free. It is also important to people who live in regions of high fraud that are blacklisted by the traditional banking system (e.g. bitcoins allow honest people in Nigeria to order computer equipment).

These two statements make me think that you aren't clear on what bitcoin mining is and how it works. Granted, bitcoin mining is less physically taxing than silver or gold mining, but it still takes effort. It also now takes capital investment and the ongoing operating expenses of electricity. Miners are not simply granted coins: they have to win them in a global race towards finding a solution to an equation that produces a number below a certain threshold. And as more people compete, that threshold gets lower, making the job more difficult.
Going to the silver/bitcoin similarities, think of it like this: there is a fixed amount of silver on earth, and it is found and mined in a semi-random process. Sometimes people will find a large pocket of silver and they can mine it and dump a bunch of silver on the market. This is risk that cannot be accounted for with precious metals, but these dips don't last long.
Instead of thinking that bitcoins come out of thin air, it's better to think that all 21 million bitcoins exist, but have yet to be mined. This is the similarity to silver. There's all that silver and all those coins out there, but it's pretty much known that there is a limit. With bitcoins, though, the limit is exactly known, and the rate at which coins are released is approximately known (it can go down for a short period before the network readjusts that target again). So there is actually a lot less risk involved with this.
However, there is one drawback to bitcoins and that is the percentage of coins being added per year. Right now, the base is inflating at about 12% per annum, Imagine what the price of silver would do if we were to find 12% of the entire world store of it and release it to the market over a year. It wouldn't kill it but it would certainly prevent it from going up and would probably make it go down by a bit.
The one thing that tempers that is bitcoin adoption. This is the number of people who decide to buy into bitcoin as a commodity or currency. If that is about 12%, then the extra coins don't matter. If it's much higher, then the bitcoin price goes up. While silver doesn't have much inflation of its base, it is also pretty much known throughout the world already, so it's also unlikely that 12% more resources are going to be put towards buying it.

No, the supply of bitcoin is literally exactly the same. The question is how does it affect demand. Maybe now demand is spread across BTC and BTC2. So before there was $1b that would be put into cryptocurrencies, and with the two of them, they both end up with a $500m market cap, which means a price reduction of bitcoin.
But the question then becomes what synthesizes the demand for BTC2? There are a long list of failed alt coins. Anyone can create an altcoin, but it's not an easy task to get people to accept it for common trade. It becomes even harder once bitcoin and a few others get established because then people just go "well, I have and use bitcoins already, why accept this one?"
All that being said, I strongly believe in the future of many alts and that bitcoin will more be a clearinghouse type reserve currency that will be used to move between them. This is because my feeling is that the blockchain cannot actually support the transaction volume needed in the future. This seems scary, but a long time ago there were lots of private currencies issued by their banks. It is something that can be handled well in a technological future.

Not 2014, 2140. But you should know quite a bit about mining before jumping in.
The most important thing to understand is difficulty. Every 2016 blocks the network resets the target that miners need to hit in order to win a block. This means as more hashing power is added to the network, the less money you will make. So as time goes on, you will get less and less out of your equipment. Also, about every 4 years, the number of bitcoins awarded per block halves.

Zillow has a automated system of comparables. It's actually pretty sophisticated because it can take the comparables at the time of the last sale to determine the intangible value of a property over others in the area and then bring it forward to the present day. Unless there were significant intangibles added since the last sale (e.g. new access to a tennis court, home remodeling, alternative energy or geothermal installations, or whatnot), the zillow price is probably fair.

When Gox stopped paying cash outs, they dropped Gox from the list, but when Gox starts paying, they will certainly turn them back on again. This will lead to Gox immediately getting back a lot of their market share.

We've kind of gone off topic. I agree with the other comments that these miners won't have an interest in destroying the network. In fact, we've had an oligopoly in mining a few times already due to the large mining pools, with I think deepbit having over 50% of the network at one time. It's actually broken up quite a bit now.

I can't say on Avalon, but for BFL no. For BFL, you give it the parameters for the header and a nonce range and it spits back a valid nonces in that range if there are some (I say multiple, because for pools you need to submit shares). There's really no way to use this protocol for vanity mining.

Make sure when you do your calculations that you estimate a network rate of about 400THps, or a difficulty of 60M. This is about how many orders are in front of you.
Avalon is delivering right now. There's little chance of it being a scam, but unless you placed your order this morning, you won't be able to try to order another one for about 6 weeks.
I highly doubt that BFL is an outright scam, but there is still risk on them being able to deliver. By their own statements, they made some chips and they didn't work out. There's no guarantee their next batch of chips will work out at all. Plus also, ordering now gets you at around 17,000 in the order queue. I don't think these will be fulfilled until late April at the earliest.
It's starting to no longer be a no brainer. Orders are entering back into the profitability range as FPGAs were last year, and this is only because the bitcoin exchange rate has appreciated nearly double in the last two months.
*It is certainly possible at this point that taking $1300 and just buying bitcoins and holding them will yield more value than purchasing an ASIC will*. Miners really have been experiencing this over and over again, as gains in the exchange rate invite more hashrate and, while $ profitability goes up, ฿ profitability goes down.

Otherwise, the government will take it as a payment in kind and the milk farmer would be in trouble.

This is really only an argument that Bitcoin can't be the sole mainstream currency. There can be many competing currencies that have their different uses. Wages and debts will always be better to offer nominated in an inflationary currency because as time goes on debts are easier to pay rather than harder, and if needed wages can be scaled back without actually reducing the wage (which also goes towards debts being possible to fulfill).
However, this is a particularly bad argument against buying into bitcoin. The idea that one should not get some coins because the value will keep going up is complete nonsense akin to "no one goes there anymore; it's too crowded.
Bitcoins act as a commodity as well as a currency. The commodity aspect is very similar to gold and it's pretty easily demonstrated that something like gold that has a long term upward trend can operate perfectly fine next to an inflationary currency. The reason gold is not used more as a currency, though, is because it is inconvenient in a digital age and it's easy to counterfeit to a lay person (you aren't going to have a register clerk checking for tungsten on every purchase). Bitcoin solves these two issues, although my feeling is that the daily transaction limits will make it so that future Bitcoin trading will be less about buying a cup of coffee and more about transferring wealth.

No it isn't. Nodes are what determine if a chain is valid and they do it independently. If BTC Guild and 50 BTC team up, they cannot start publishing blocks that give them 100 bitcoins each. They can only publish blocks that conform to the existing protocol and if they use all of that computing power to publish invalid blocks, the nodes like my QT client will just reject them and their hashing power will effectively be 0 and slush will be the new leader.
I think you might be confused with the BIP process where the core devs can put forward protocol change proposals and miners can mine towards a vote, but then the devs take the results, implement it into the client, and everyone has to upgrade by a certain date. *It still requires all of the nodes to agree and update*. Mining power cannot change the bitcoin protocol.

I have to warn you that this is only true to a certain extent. This is actually a good estimate that does assumes the future difficulty increase you'll face at the time you receive the unit. However, if you go 3 or 4 months from when you receive the unit, then it's probable that the amount of bitcoin will go down (in a weird way, the $ amount received probably won't go down by much due to bitcoin price inflation). The upshot is that it is way better to borrow $250 and pay that back in dollars than borrow 5.5 btc and pay that back in btc.
Also, jalapenos are only $149. It seems like you are buying two. On top of that, if you buy today you shouldn't expect to get the unit until June so there will be two months of no earnings, making a 6 month repayment unlikely.

There are a few altcoins already, so we don't have to speculate. One in particular, litecoin, has gained some traction.
I recently[ read an article]( on this topic. A relevant quote is "In the real world, a Niklas Zennström cannot come along and create underground reserves ex nihilo of what in substance would be the equivalent of gold, except that it be blue and called jold." It's an interesting perspective.
The answer is, though, that bitcoin has the network affect behind it. The strength of a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants. As more people accept and trade in bitcoins, it becomes less of a risk that people will stop using it in the future. It is possible that people will stop en masse, but it is highly unlikely.
An example of this is social networks. Now it is possible that bitcoin will become a myspace, but there are external factors that led to myspace's demise: spammers, etc. In addition, a new platform with integrated gaming came up: facebook. So it's certainly possible that in the future there could be negative pressure on bitcoin and at the same time there might be something that addresses it all in a novel way (ripple). But if that's really the case, you can always just move your bitcoin value over to the new currency, and if it *doesn't* happen, then you've missed out completely.

The term "pegged" has specific meaning when relating to currencies and commodities. It means to manipulate the value of one so that it maintains the same ratio over time. The fact that prices in bitcoin fluctuate so much is because it is not pegged. And bitcoin can get where goods and services are not so tied to the dollar, but it needs a more mature economy: one where a the verticle production of an item can be done nearly entirely in bitcoin.
Still that does not free the currency completely. If the value of a bitcoin doubles, then prices will likely halve. This is because those bitcoin suppliers will have trouble selling their items if a person feels they could trade it for fiat and buy a competitor's product. This relative value is felt by all currencies and us why, say, Venezuala debased their currency this week to encourage exports, and all other sorts of nasty policies governments love to inflict on their people.
We weren't talking about since 1933, we were talking about the price of gold since 2000. I think this isn't really a focus here though. We both agree price inflation has and will occur on fiat. I've explained why it's unlikely with bitcoin despite modest and shrinking monetary inflation.

This would be an incredibly bad setup because then someone could publicly scan IP addresses passing the onion address in a Host header and if the SR came back, you would have a confirmation that the site is there.

The value seriously cannot level out for a while. We'll have periods of it leveling off for a few months, like in 2012, followed by gains, followed by surges, and then followed by pull backs. But the long term trend has got to be higher to support all of the economy that will be running on bitcoin.
That being said, I understand the feeling of risk. Personally, to buy in more, I would wait for what looks like a low, wait for it to recover 50% of the loss and then start averaging in.
Also, as always, commit to 5% of your funds to it, not 100%.

Every time you spend dollars, you are spending dollars that could have been turned into bitcoins. The future loss in bitcoin price rise is the same, so why do you spend your fiat when you could be acquiring bitcoins?
Maybe it's just that you don't have enough bitcoins. I personally just spent $20 in bitcoins at Steak n Shake the other day because my wife and I wanted breakfast. Is it possible that 20 years from now I'll be out $200,000, yeah maybe. But if I spent $20 in dollars instead of buying bitcoins, I'm out that money as well, so what's the difference?

Fundamentally, is there a problem with this? I understand is introduces an aspect of risk to bitcoin holdings, but is there really any issue to having competing coins. Litecoin itself is up and coming.
The first mover advantage and network effect both add a lot of value to bitcoin over others. You can copy the bitcoin code, but you cannot copy the goodwill that has been fostered to the currency. The concern about this seems similar to being worried about Canadian dollar holdings because Zimbabwe has made a new currency.

The algorithm for mining needs to be hard to solve but easy to verify. In addition, it need to scale the difficulty of solving based on computing resources.

It does indicate this, but it really only indicates this at this time. I've seen charts like this in an instant tilt the other way.
A lot of times the large vertical lines (called walls) are manipulations to keep the price down, or to push it up. When trades start hitting them, the walls disappear. It's not 100% clear why people do this, but someone might sell a bunch of coins and then put up a wall to give an impression of weakness so that the price drops a bit and they can buy back in. It works because someone who wants to sell their coins quickly knows that they cannot put the sale in above the wall, so all new sale orders are put in below. However, with people buying so many coins from things like coinbase and bitinstant, these tricks don't work so well because the buyers there don't care about the order book, and so those services smash into the walls all the time, causing them to be pulled down.

The problem, I feel, about thinking Avalon is a scam is that now would be the perfect time for them to take in another round of preorders, but they haven't. They are saying they are waiting to fulfill their current book before accepting new orders. If they really were not shipping, then it would make a lot more sense that they would take a final round of orders before the jig was up.
That being said, the Avalon team is saying that they really have no idea how long these things will take to get through customs. They are shipping from China. As an example, I ordered a audio splitter from an auction house seller who was shipping out of China in November, and I only received the item last week.

The security in cryptocoins comes from the unlikelihood of an attacker finding n blocks in a row. This is just as unlikely in block time in bitcoin as litecoin. However, in a given time frame, an attacker will have 4 times more tries to create a fork chain than in bitcoin. However, if in litecoin you go to requiring n+1 blocks, the increased security is exponential, so even with 4 times more tries, it's a significant disadvantage, and the greater security is achieved in less time.

With respect to Sonny Vleisides, it appears to me that he got caught up in an enterprise with his biological father who was a [long time scam artist]( It is a real problem that when people reunite with their biological parents as adults that the bio parent will try to take advantage of them. With James Ray Houston being an experienced con man, I don't think Sonny had much of a chance of not being pulled in. I also feel that the reason he works at BFL is because his conviction probably makes it hard for him to find real work, and so [his stepfather, the CEO]( got him a job there. I'm sure he is a talented person who could get work elsewhere if it weren't for a conviction. Unfortunately, this country seems to feel it's important to continue punish convicts after they have served their sentences, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.

It's not double taxation. You would evaluate your American tax liability and if it is higher than your Canadian one, you would pay the difference. There are not many circumstances where a Canadian tax liability would be higher than an American one and the cases that are there have to do with what is defined as taxable and what deductions are allowed (one example would be winning the lotto, which is taxable in the US but not in Canada).

As soon as you plug in the usb drive to a computer, if that computer is hacked/virused, etc, you can expect that the wallet is copied.

However, there is a hardware wallet coming out soon, so that will probably end up being the way to go.

Yes, the reason fir using .ew addresses is because until you have a spend transaction, no one knows your public key as your bitcoin address is a hash of that.Once you spend from there, you necessarily have to publish your public key. This means that if there is a.vulnerability discovered. In ecdma, your coins are at risk. Without the public key pu lished, there wohld need to be a vulnerability in both the hashing algorithm for keys (can't recall now and on my phone. It's not sha256) and in ecdma for someone to spend your coins.
Generally it does not add to plausible deniability.

I disagree with bitnumus. Order book movements are helpful in knowing direction. Personally, I use the tilt a lot, which is for X amount of bitcoins bought/sold, how much dollar value does it move up or down. If it moves down less than up, then the tilt it to the upside, meaning a higher price is likely.
That being said, the order book in manipulated. The walls are mostly there to herd orders, but that just means you have to go with the flow of the manipulation.

Yet another attempt at valuation that confuses stores with flow. This time, surprisingly, it's on the opposite side, where the total reserves of energy has nothing to do with securing the blockchain, but the flow from those reserves does.

This is generally a view of libertarian philosophy. While libertarians abhor fraud and theft like this, we think twice about invoking the regulatory specter of the state to fix the problem. This is especially so when we see that there are steps an individual could have taken in these cases. Investing coins in a completely deregulated stock market where the operators are pseudonomymous and likely in a different jurisdiction is a big goddamn risk and if people want to take it, have at it, but if the operator folds and takes all the coins, the warning signs were there.


Let me tell you something. I recently had a transaction with yochdog, a person who I had had successful business with before, a person that *I* nominated for the position of one of two representatives who were trustworthy enough to incpect BFL headquarters once they were producing ASICs and of the people nominated was voted by bitcointalk into one of those two positions thus showing he is one of the two top trusted people on the entire site, and I still had him put his coins in escrow. So when dealing in trade with anyone regardless of their price history, my advice is this: escrow, motherfucker, use it.
In the case of these exchanges, I would touch one unless they were publicly bonded for more than their deposit amount, and if they got to the point where they weren't, I'd sell my stock and find somewhere else.

His mistake is in not understanding that value is experienced by bitcoin users when they engage in trade.

This is because in each voluntary trade, both people get utility than they individually put into the trade.

I'm not sure how much you know about elliptical curve cryptography. The public key is generated by taking the private key d and finding the point Q on the elliptical curve that corresponds to d\*G. G is known from [Secp256k1]( The public key is really just the x co-ordinate of that point, but that is because the y co-ordinate can be found quickly with the x.
This has a great property that if you increment the private key by n, then (d+n)\*G = d\*G+n\*G. This is the problem though that I'm talking about. In deterministic wallets, so to generate the next public key, you just have to take this public key and add n\*G.

This is kind of a nonsequitor, not just with the prior statement but within itself. I agree that the creator made virtual gold. But it is vitrual gold that has novel properties for value transmission. These novel properties make it so that bitcoin is not purely a speculative market, but is instead a market based on the need to trade while using these properties.
Think about the alt coins. The reason they remain lower in value to bitcoin is because bitcoin has an ever growing number of ways to use them for real goods and services. I guarantee that if BitPay were to release a litecoin payment gateway so that anyone could pay at any of their vendors with litecoin (and then it converts to fiat or bitcoin in the background), that litecoin value would shoot up. But right now most of the alt coins are speculative markets precisely because they cannot be used for trade and this is why they languish.

For the most part, when I see deep discounts like this, it is for digital goods or services. I don't feel that they are making this decision because of the hope for a higher value coin in  the future, but instead because using bitcoins removes the reversibility of the transaction. This is desired because digital goods are very easily reversed because it is harder to prove delivery than with a mailed item, and they are more prone to fraud because they can be operated on anonymously.

This isn't fully correct. Their first batch is comprised of 5000 chips, but an SC single has 8 chips, a mini rig has 192 chips. A jalapeno has 1 chip. So the batch will have much less than 5k units in it.
The second batch will have 6k chips. The first batch was supposed to have 6k, but they sacrificed a wafer for testing.
They claim after that, it will be a more continuous process. The reason for the batches now was to prove out the wafers. Once they are proven, they can start cranking out asics.

No online wallet can give a guarantee if the information leak was you. Blockchain.info practically gives this guarantee technically because they never see your private keys in an unencrypted form. But if you get some malware that gives someone access to your passwords and files, no one is going to warantee that. You are also talking to a community that has seen (apparently from evidence) Russian hackers target a specific person because they saw him make a transaction from a wallet with a high number of coins. This shit is real money, and you need to treat it as such. This is less of a concern if you only have a few hundred dollars. Personally I like to protect myself by making sure all transactions go through TOR.


Yes, you can. This comment applies to 2011 but hasn't been true for a long time. You've admitted a geeky side. There is plenty of legal stuff on [BitMit]( and [The Bitcoin Store]( that will not only fit your interests but impress you in price. (warning, some thing on BitMit are poorly priced though. Do your research)
Aside from those two main sites, there are a lot of other vendors. There's an Etsy group for people who accept bitcoins. There's There's the bitcointalk marketplace. Recent estimates indicate that illegal transactions are *at most* 1/5th of the bitcoin economy (note this counts SatoshiDice and poker as legal). I've spent thousands of dollars in bitcoin and I've never once made an illegal transaction. I won't ever accept this perspective.


Fair enough. I agree this is a problem but it will only get better.


Using blockchain.info instead of a full node client is the answer to this. I don't ever direct a new user to QT, I tell them to use blockchain.info and sync with the same app on their phone. Anything else has a high chance to lead to tears for the non-technical.

First of all, it is important to note that this is only from one payment processor who only represented 6% of the transactions on that day. 
To get a better idea of what we are looking at, Bitcoin transfered [$410M on bitcoin black friday]( But we can't really say that all of this was economic activity. We can say that it was about $150M more than the 7 day average of $260M. So let's say that $260M is the baseline and that the $150M extra is economic activity from that day. That would put it closer to 1.3% of the bitcoin market cap for that day.
For reference, there is [$11T in M2 money stock]( The US GDP is about [$15.6T]( meaning an average of 0.3% of the market cap for dollars is spent on economic activity per day.

I agree. Now there is less excuse for people to not buy in and without some fear of risk tempering those decisions, it could runaway again. However that would take bitcoin to the $60-100 range. It's not close to this level.

This is considered aggressive bargaining (forcing the idea of what is proper onto the other person) and the fact of the matter is that is does not work from a role that is generally submissive to the other person.
Look more into Non-violent communication. A better approach can be to discuss how you personally feel on a topic. An example would be "When you don't allow me to purchase bitcoins with my money, you make me feel that you think I am unable to make rational decisions about my money, and I feel like lesser of a person because of this. I would like for you to give me some trust and help me purchase some bitcoin."

Pyramining isn't a pyramid scheme or gambling. It's a mining bond company with multi-level marketing. Basically you buy shares of mining equipment, and if you refer more people, then you get bonuses to your shares and the person signing up also get a small bonus to encourage them to use the referral.
I really haven't thought about them for a while though. I wonder what their ASIC strategy is for old customers. It seems they old customers are just screwed. My preferred action for a mining bond company is to sell the hardware on the open market and then rebuy ASIC devices with the money, or (even better) just issue a dividend on that sale and let the investor figure it out.

A [correction]( is a drop in a security value by at least 10% (about $2.50/btc). This is the official term, but I rarely hear people using it this way because most people aren't that into finance. In general, people mean that the price runs up, but often it shoots past the true point of equilibrium of value because the rising price encourages more buying. The "correction" is a minor retracement of this to go back to where the equilibrium really is.

The block erupter is such a bad product that even after halving the price, it's likely it will still never recoup its retail cost. The erupter blades also suffer from horrible ROI at ฿5/GH but maybe they changed their pricing on those.


I'm not sure where this impression is from. Yifu has been stringing along customers for quite a while now with batch 2 orders still not fullfilled, and a big bruhaha about FPGA trade ins not being honored (they were kind of honored, but you had to mail them in months ago, and if you did, you still wouldn't have your ASIC unit right now). Yifu also increased the price of his product in Batch 3 to ฿1.19/GHps. He also announced that he would be mining with their own hardware and then there came some evidence that he was actually mining with preorders (but really, we don't know). Then he started selling raw chips essentially screwing his pre-orders and putting BFL in a position where they needed to also sell raw chips or be cut out of the market. And all this for a product that is considered to be worse than BFL.
Don't let the hate blind you, BFL *right now* has the cheapest product in terms of $/GHps and also has the lowest GHps/W. That is why people keep ordering from them. This may change once KnCMiner ships, though.

There are already fragments like namecoin and even fragments with different hashing algorithms like Litecoin and core philosophies like Freicoin and ppcoin. This is the great thing about voluntary currency: you can pick the one that you feel benefits you the most, and if others agree then you can operate on it.
It is almost certain that after some time there will need to be many other bitconomies. The blockchain can only sustain so many transactions per hour.

All currencies are bubbles built only on the perception of demand. The US dollar is hugely inflated because of the perception that it should be used as a reserve currency, something that the BRIC nations are trying to undo. The key aspect is will the currency hit a point of equilibrium or will it enter into a state of perpetual fear. We went through a cycle of fear in the past and recovered. This indicates that even if there is a mass sell off, there is still a base amount of usage that justifies the currency, and this will cause it to retain value.
In short, saying any currency is a bubble is a tautology and really doesn't add anything to the conversation. The focus must be one where the true point of value equilibrium lies.

Actually, yes I am claiming that for the most part in the medium term. Mining is a competitive business that drives miners to the highest profit, which *right now* is determined by $/GHps. In addition to that, there is a fixed amount of risk represented in the market as dollars that gets put toward mining equipment. Historically, this has been in the 6-8 month payback timeframe. Let's work some numbers.
With 3600 bitcoins/day, and price at $120, and Avalon selling at $25/Ghps, that means the difficulty would go to 440m before stabilizing at a 6 month payback. This means a hashrate of about 3,150THps. To go from 100THps to 3,150THps, it would take $76.25m. So there's about $76m out there that can be comfortably spent to bring the hashrate up to where these machines have a 6 month payoff.  One last note on this, I've really simplified things here by assuming that buying an Avalon chip just gives you that hashrate, but we all know it needs supporting electronics, but I don't have a way to cost for that.
I absolutely contend that this $76m would mostly to Avalon, and BFL offering a chip at a higher $/GHps rate will not have any significant affect on hash demand. That is because hash demand is set by the number of bitcoins released, the price of bitcoin, and the most profitable mining equipment, period. If BFL had come in with a lower price than Avalon, then they could affect hash demand. They power requirements might change the scene a little, but not at this profitability level. Just ask any GPU miner today if power costs are a concern.


You're right. This is what Adam smith called the invisible hand of the market. This is all voluntary, but because the market is competitive and not coercive, these actions are also necessary for BFLs continued operation.


Exxon has already secured its profits via oil sales. They don't need to sell natural gas. And that natural gas has a higher energy density and is cheaper and cleaner to run than oil. What the fuck! They have a responsibility to their oil customers. Who cares if Chevron is already undercutting their natural gas business.
Nothing about this makes any sense in the world of business. It's the BFL emotional warp that has everything they do as bad as sodomizing one's grandmother while pouring sugar in one's gas tank.


As I think I clearly stated, the people who bought at the lower price point have a better $/GHps ratio than the raw chips. This doesn't even factor in any buildout. They aren't getting screwed and won't be screwed unless Avalon or BFL drop their price.


Ultimately, no. They aren't even planning delivery of these chips before Avalon delivers their first batch orders, so it's hard to even think this is a bad action. It's just the way the market is affecting mining right now.
However, I do have [arguments for why BFL should have a scam tag]( that are not based on free market values. Namely, their deceptive statements regarding their progress ultimately caused financial harm to Avalon and cablepair.

The letter was to address all virtual currencies in general. Like the FinCEN guidelines have a section on centralized virtual currencies (like Liberty Reserve or Linden Dollars), it has a section on decentralized currencies. You really shouldn't mix the two. A key aspect here in the letter is that Liberty Reserve was centralized and failed to meet the requirements to prevent money laundering under Section 311.
By contrast what Ben said was that "in general, the Federal Reserve would only have authority to regulate a virtual currency product if it is issued by, or cleared or settled through, a banking organization that we supervise" and goes on to talk about how AML and KYC is being applied *at the exchanges*. It's also important to realize that the exchanges by and large have been fully co-operative in this effort. This means that Section 311 is really not an issue for bitcoin.

There's another thing I was thinking about the other day. Peoples needs are generally measured in fiat dollars.

When the price was $20, he was selling 50 coins/month, but now with the price above $45, he might only 23 coins, meaning the higher price leads to a lower supply from those most likely to sell.

It really shouldn't, but the problem I have with the way things have been going is that instead of actually amending the constitution with the changes that supposedly represent society, the modus operandi of the government is to pass a law chipping at the clear rights presented in the constitution and then having the supreme court ratify the erosion of those rights under the idea of "general welfare." If you want to restrict certain kinds of guns that are realistically no more deadly than other kinds of guns, then make an amendment to do so. If you want to restrict certain kinds of expression, then make an amendment to do so. If you want to make it so that RICO laws can confiscate property without due process, then make an amendment to do so. If you want to continue to extend out copyright on existing materials into perpetuity, then pass an amendment to do so. Don't pass a law and then have your stacked supreme court validate the laws that should never have been made in the first place.

You had to be an originator of the decentralized virtual currency for this to apply. A person who buys coins, holds them, and then sells them in a personal transaction is not a Money Trasnmistter. A person who self mines coins and sells them, is not. There is a bit of a grey area if you mine on a pool, especially for PPS. Technically the pool originates them and you just get a fee, as if you had rented your equipment to them. Earning bitcoins and then selling them in a personal transactions is also unregulated per FinCEN. Also, mining P2pool might be regulated. Finally, mining and then using it to buy some kind of item (like a bottle of wine on bitmit) is unregulated.
However, operating an exchange is regulated and you are a Money Transmitter. This is where you hold bitcoin funds from one person and dollar funds from a second person and then match up the trade between these two, and then send dollars to the first person and decentralized virtual currency to the other. Actually, regardless of bitcoin or anything, if you're accepting funds from one person and then relaying them to another at the direction of the first person, you are a Money Transmitter.

Warren Buffet said “When everyone else is greedy, be afraid. When everyone else is afraid, be greedy.” The key here is "everyone else." 99.95% of the people out there haven't even heard of bitcoin. Of those that have, I'd guess that 90% don't own even a fraction of a coin.

There is nothing to fully prevent it. You can look at the pirate debacle to see that there has been fractional reserve banking already: some people trusting "paper bitcoins" over actual bitcoins. However, it is at least resistant to frb because it is easy to store securely for a common person, as opposed to gold, which requires expensive vaults, and the price deflationary nature of bitcoins make it so that people so not feel that they have to have their bitcoins "working for them" (i.e. on deposit at an investment house) to retain value.

The price relies on a balance of value in versus value out. If someone has come to the conclusion that they need to get rid of their coins, then the only thing that will hold that up is someone else deciding they want to get the same number of coins.

BFL was clear that their ASIC work was based on models. There was no false advertising. Tom/bASIC did lie when they stated they had a working prototype.


BFL didn't use any development methodology for the ASIC chips, they outsourced the work. If you look at the released picture of the ASIC, you can see the signature of the design company in the lower right.
They do have some work when it comes to the controller code. They haven't stated their methodology there, but I am not really concerned with that. As a software developer who has worked at places with methodologies from ad hoc to CMM2, I don't really find that this is important to my purchase. The only thing that is important is "does it hash."


I think that BFL has been pretty transparent in this. I suggest you read the forums. Also, at this point I'm doubtful that first shipment is more than two weeks away, whereas I was dubious of other timeline claims.


There is no alpha testing phase. To attempt to deliver to market faster, units will be tested for 24 hours and then shipped.
The delivery time changes were related to development timelines at third party sites being extended.


This seems accusatory, but every other ASIC vendor did the same thing. Where is the post for Avalon?
They made their estimate based on their experience with their FPGA product. Really it was hubris. They had, and continue to have, no real idea what it would take to get a product completed. And then it turned out that they fucked up their first chip design and had to change packaging to hit heat requirements. And then more hubris as they thought they could just turn it around within a few weeks. The fact that they are bad estimators doesn't mean malice, but it did lead to some shitty situations like people in September/October not buying FPGAs and an upgrade because they figured ASIC was around the corner.


In reading your rant, it just seems like you haven't followed the forums at all. You say they should answer your questions, but since January they have been very open about what is going on and have really answered most of what you're asking for. In addition, tone is important and your post comes off as accusatory and not inquisitive. Even I've been a little brash on their forum at times but I kept it respectful and got my questions answered. It's important to engage people in a way that they will continue to want to help you.
There are a lot of things I don't like about BFLs actions in this. I think everything they did in the September-December timeframe was reprehensible. But they have opened up a lot now, so I don't see where this ire is justified.

The customers who paid earlier received their units first in their product line in this case and now in all cases. The 1/3rd plan was regarding **a partial randomization of the orders placed in the first month** using the first batch of chips (ostensibly to spread the hash around, but there are other good aspects, like making a person who waited 3 months not so different than one that waited 2 months and 3 weeks), the *exact opposite* of what you are asking for.

Bitcoins do not replace the credit card, they create an entirely new market where trust is imputed on the buyer instead of the seller as in credit cards. This is what makes it unique.

This is a myth. You need to convince nearly 100% of the nodes and get them to upgrade their software. Even if you convince 90% of the users, you would need to convince the important nodes such as whatever node is used by BitPay, Gyft, BitMit, The Bitcoin Store, Mt Gox and all other exchanges, etc, before your rule becomes useful, otherwise when you try to spend your coins on typical goods and services, your transaction will be rejected.
Bitcoin is not a democracy, it's an [agreement]( to a protocol for value transfer between participants. If 50% of the web browsers decide to say GxET instead of GET in their header, then the system isn't adjusted to a new header, it's just broken.

How do you fund the research for the ASICs without taking preorders?
How do you ensure that in the time you are researching ASICs the bitcoin economy doesn't go down the shitter?
Does your evaluation of this differ with the understanding that bitcoins are $6/coin with the reward having looming? This was the situation in June when BFL was accepting pre-orders.
One of the companies (ASICMINER) did exactly what you're talking about: they got crowdfunding through GLBSE and researched their own chips and are now mining them. They have the most verified ASIC hashpower on the network at the moment.
How can you be certain that your competitors won't crowd you out?
In the case of BFL, they don't just want to be a bitcoin company: they want to be a general custom hardware solutions company. Their FPGA pages talk about their use for medical research. They'd rather prove themselves and take 1% of a $100 billion industry than take a chance at less than 50% of a $600 million commodity.
Avalon has stated their project was specifically to prevent ASIC hegemony. They didn't expect to be first to deliver.

This actually wasn't even the problem. The problem was that people had stopped trading actual tulips and instead were trading tulip futures (i.e. paper tulips). Then when the markets closed due to th black plague people realized all they had was a bunch of paper that they couldn't do anything with.
The markets closing can be likened to the two Mt Gox related crashes that have happened, but ultimately bitcoin has come back from both of those. Tulip futures did not. The reason why is because you couldn't buy anything with tulip futures, you had to go to the market to exchange for money and use that. With bitcoins, there are lots of places to buy things even if Mt Gox is down, and not we have resilience in that we don't just have one market to go to to clear our coins.

It's possible for public debt to add value to society. For example, using public debt to create something like the Hoover Dam, which then provides large amounts of electricity to many people and businesses, increasing productivity and removing the reliance on mining, can give a large net benefit. The problem comes in where we are not using it for these kinds of things. All we are doing is simply appropriating debt to pay for bills that should be paid by revenue (i.e. taxes). This is similar to a person going on a vacation on a credit card, versus getting debt to buy a home.

The counter-party risk is small but it is there. Tomorrow coinbase could shutter it's doors, go into Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and I would bet that there would be little recourse for the people who hold coins there. It's something to consider.
If you are unsure with the security of your PC, that is understandable, but if that's the case, you had better be using 2FA on coinbase because a compromise of your PC can be a compromise of all your online passwords that you type.
Finally, we don't know fully what the security concerns are with coinbase. We hope they have it right, but a small hole on one of their pages could easily lead to big trouble.

You don't need to reverse hashes because you will get the public key when the coins are spent. However, after looking at this more, it does seem that the factor of G between public keys is unknown (it's derived from a hash of a string of the offset and the master public key), so it's fine.

As other said, it's a transaction fee. this fee is optional if you are running your own client, but blockchain will charge a fee regardless. Not paying the fee will drastically delay the transaction.
In the most technical sense, the .0005 doesn't go anywhere. The inputs have 0.0022764 btc and the outputs have 0.0017764 btc. This allows a miner who includes the transaction in their processing list to assign the .0005 difference to their own address.

The computational difficulty prevents a longer blockchain from being created and released, but if one were made somehow, nothing prevents the transaction from being reverses.
But the purpose of the blockchain is to form a consensus on the order of the transactions. Because different nodes see different transactions at different times, there is no ordering to them.  With no order, if there are two transactions that use the same coins introduced to two different node, there's no way to resolve it.

The answer to that is "it depends". You have to buy vanilla reloads in $500 increments, but [some CVSes will allow you to purchase up to $5000 at one time]( but then bluebird has a $1000 daily limit so it will take you 5 days to load that.

Not just stay that low, but there is the fear that it could keep falling. Minimizing his losses means putting in a stop level where if it goes under that, he requires himself to sell out to make sure he has a certain amount of dollars.

Producing the first ASIC costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, so preorders were necessary to finance the research into them. There is one company that decided to self mine: ASICMiner, but even they had to sell shares to fund their design phase. Because of the competitive nature of ASICs, the importance of time to market, and the unstable nature of bitcoin, it would have been a great risk to try to just develop this on your own. Recall that bitcoins were just above $6 per coin when BFL first started taking pre-orders. Finally, Avalon is now legitimately self mining with their own equipment, which is their right as the IP owners, and Avalon and BFL are locked into a competitive cycle that now has them into raw chip sales.
Sure, using these things is great for the first company, but it causes a loss for the second and third.

But, and forgive me if you feel that this is way out of line, I don't really feel an impetus to give my own money to someone to do those things.
I have my own street experience, and my experience tells me that if someone figures out a way to convert goodwill into personal wants (not needs, wants) they will become much more effective at doing this than someone who is simply meeting their needs.
So the problem I have here is not that people aren't getting what they need, but that if some people are getting what they want, then that will crowd out the needy. And if I'm giving a dollar, I want it to go to someone in need. That's why I prefer a little more structure to my charities. 


That means half a pizza could have gone to someone else who was hungry.

then when you make an order online the zip code has to match the one you set. If you don't set this zip code, usually an online order will be rejected. This is true on any site, not just Virwox.

Worst case, you won't make your money back and bitcoin dies. This isn't really likely.
What is likely is that you preorder and ASIC for, say $1299. That would be about ฿62.8. You get it and mine and the difficulty keeps going up along with the exchange rate to $50 and you end up mining a maximum of ฿45 out of the thing. So you got your money back in fiat ($2250) but you are worse off than buying bitcoin directly. This problem has been plaguing miners since about June, and while early ASIC adopters are pretty much sure to makes gains on both, at this point in time it's not so clear that mining is the best choice.
If you order one now, expect it in May, not April. This assumes BFL does not slip again.

Bitcoin is only extremely price deflationary right now because of the adoption rate. Once it finds an equilibrium between the population and the users, the deflation will really only be slight.

They don't process the bitcoin orders, Bitpay does. This includes refunds: they submit the refund request to bitpay and bitpay acquires the coins and debits BFL.

Everyone is saying China, but this is not right. The reason it leveled off is because people who were deciding to get into the bitcoin game (wrongly) decided to pour their money into buying ASIC miners. Now that it is apparent that this investment has severe problems because of the rising difficulty, the dollars are going into buying coins again. *Even in this environment, KNC Miner sold [3 million dollars]( worth of equipment in 3 days*. People keep thinking that there is small shit going on in bitcoin when everything is indicating that large amounts of money are entering into the system very rapidly. It's not just China, it's not just the perceived stability now that Silk Road is no longer a crutch, it's not just the viable alternative markets eclipsing Gox, it's not just tens of thousands of merchants becoming available to bitcoin ecosystem in the past few months, it's all of these things driving dollars into bitcoin.

But aside from the fact that wasn't a perfect strategy using hindsight, it is still a good deal in my view.

I'm a little doubtful that 35,000,000 people have a fraction of a bitcoin. Where did you get this idea from?
@_date: 2013-02-12 22:22:50
It's good that you're interested in gold and silver, I encourage you to watch [this video]( to understand how bitcoin is a complementary security to gold and silver. As it relates to trade of precious metals on the world market, bitcoin is the most efficient way for buyers and sellers to meet a price equilibrium and to trade their metals without any third party risk. It's a powerful complement to what you already like.
Now let's talk about value. It's really important to understand where value comes from. Before we talk about precious metals and bitcoin, though, let's talk about some water in a flask. Assume you have a flask; how much would you pay for someone to transfer all water from their flask into your flask? Probably not much, maybe not anything. 
Now let's say you are in the middle of the dessert and your flask is empty and you know you need a full flask of water to make it to the next town or you will die. You have $10,000 in your pocket. How much would you pay for this stranger's water? Probably you would give all $10,000 if he demanded it.
Now let's say this stranger only has one flask of water, and he too needs it to live to get to the next town. How much would he be willing to accept to give it to you? Probably he wouldn't sell it, even for $10,000.
The important aspect here is that the water doesn't have an objective value. Without turning this into a long essay, the value comes from *the perceived cost to replace the utility of that item". This is why when the perception is that there is no replacement of utility because selling it leads to certain death, the value goes to infinity.
Ok, let's talk about precious metals for a bit. Let's say you want to buy an oz of silver and you're at a store selling an oz of silver for $34.10 ($3 above spot). You also know of a guy across town that sells silver at spot, but it will cost $4 in gas to drive there and back. Assuming your time is worthless, what's better value? Clearly buying the silver where you are at because the other oz will cost $35.10. To replace the utility lost on passing up on this piece of silver would cost you $1 more. So you make the deal.
So why do you buy silver? Because you have faith that in the future you will be able to trade that silver for something of use to you. It might not be directly: you might convert to some currency and then buy Diablo 4 or something. Who knows? You just think that in the future you will be able to do so. In addition, your lack of faith in inflationary currency and your faith in silver true value stability makes you think that the silver will be worth more in the future. This is why you'll pay over spot today, or waste gas to go get it across town. You feel in the future you'll be able to trade for more than $34.10 nominal dollars in value. This faith comes as a future projection based on historical observation and an understanding of the physical world that let's you know that it is unlikely that large amount of silver might be suddenly created by chemical/nuclear process or even found and mined.
So let's bring all that back to bitcoin. Bitcoin's value operates exactly the same way that silver does. Someone who wants a bitcoin goes out the the market and tries to find one. Why do they want to buy a bitcoin? Let's say they are addicted to gambling and want to try to "catch up" by playing under 1000 on SatoshiDice. They live in a jurisdiction where it would cost them easily $1000 to go to the nearest casino. They see on Mt Gox that a coin is selling for $25.46. On BitFloor, it's $25.29. But he doesn't have a BitFloor account and he's already transfered some fiat into Gox, so the lost time utility and the transfer fees and the exchange price risk convince him to buy at $25.46 on Gox. He does so and the price goes to $25.47. He bets and loses. Now he needs one more coin...
So the value is just like the value of silver. The value of this bitcoin is just whatever it would cost me to replace the utility of that coin. Sometimes sellers sell the price down because the utility of their coins is not as high as their need for fiat (a miner with an electricity bill). Sometimes buyers buy it up because they want to make a transaction and don't want to wait for a limit order to fulfill (or they use a service like bitinstant that will just buy at market). When more people have the financial need to buy than more people have the financial need to sell, the price rises.
There are other aspects that are like silver, and that is the faith. There's a faith that the value of a bitcoin tomorrow will be about the same as it is today. It's not quite the same faith as in silver. There was a gigantic crash from $30 down to $3 in 2011. Because of this, many are aware that there is risk here. But the recovery from there to $25 is signalling that even if that happens, it is possible that it will recover again. In addition, like the physical qualities of silver kind of ensure that a large new amount of silver won't be dumped on the market, the algorithmic qualities of bitcoin ensure the same thing.
Russia and China storing silver and gold is like individuals storing coins in cold wallets. Silver itself had its own recent crash in 2011 due to paper manipulation by [Goldman Sachs]( The BRIC nations could create a new reserve currency and China could dump its reserves. This is the same as old bitcoin holders selling once the price hits a certain point or they need a [100mpg car]( or something. But I'll bet that if that does happen, within 10 years silver will recover. And now we are seeing evidence that if a major dumping does happen in bitcoin, that it will recover too.
The point is the price of silver is only *propped up* by the by what people perceive its value to be. The industrial and jewelry use would only support less than a 10th of the value you are paying for it. But you don't panic. You have faith that the past history is an indication of future results. The same is true for bitcoins, although I would say that we probably to recognize more potential for risk. When I recommend people who want to invest in bitcoins, I say not to put more of 5% of their retirement into it because of the downside risk. Tempering the downside risk is the upside potential. If you could buy silver at $.03110 oz, would you?

The TH rate is not directly observed but instead reverse calculated based on block generation time. If we ran into a string of luck yesterday, it would have appeared to be a massive spike in the hashpower which would then get smoothed out over time. My feeling is that this is the most likely scenario, since Avalon only expect 2 units to be hashing right now (the rest did not get special handling at customs, and so are sitting on a bureaucrat's desk right now) and ASICMINER says they are still assembling their boards.
One other possibility is that Carnisaur might be testing, as they have not been too forthcoming with their details, and this is about the right size for their project. But unfortunately the changes are within normal variances, so there's no real way to know. We would need to see an increase that holds to know for sure that some next gen tech is out there.

The unit price is a psychological divider only. It really should be market capitalization, but people just have a tendency to look at unit price, even in stocks. BRK-A could go a 1:100 split and it's value wouldn't change. Similarily, you could think of a bitdime being worth $4.70.
However, without the economy supporting bitcoins, you are right that at a certain price based on the amount of coins will start to give resistance until more people want to come into the economy. It's this effect of people coming into the economy that is pushing the price up.

It?s not really a problem for those that accept bitcoins because of services like bitpay that automatically translate the coin to fiat. 
It does pose some problems for consumers because the coins are not a reliable way to store value due to fluctuation, and if you try to buy a specific amount of coin for a purchase you could be left short. Still, with the trend upwards, it does make it advantageous to hold some coin, so this problem is kind of negated if you are willing to buy a little more coin than you need to transact.
I do agree it is a less than ideal scenario, so I wouldnt debate it too much. Clearly people are using it as a currency though, and as the price goes higher, and the distribution of coins widens, my feeling is these swings will become less volatile.

3 - combo is your best option for maximizing gains. If the bitcoin price goes up, you tend not to see that in mining because more miners move in and drive up the difficulty.

There's kind of two different things going on with Mt Gox. There is a DDoS attack, which I think they are doing the right thing for: outsourcing it to a company that takes care of these things. The only other option is to port your platform to a cloud service (e.g. Amazon), but you should still have protection in front of that.
The second thing is that their platform is not scalable to their transaction demand. This is part of what I do for a living and there is no one real answer, and to come up with a real plan would take a good amount of analysis. To spitball some ideas, I would probably look at having load balanced redundant non-clustered front end servers using a messaging system to submit orders to a back end transaction system that resolves transactions *in memory* and updates the state to the database which is then read back by the front-end servers.

I think that this whole discussion is based on a bad understanding of Gresham's law. Gresham's law simply states that if the composite materials of a certain coin in a currency are undervalued by law, then that coin will disappear from circulation because it is profitable to take the coin and smelt it into those materials, or even just sell it as bullion.
There are cases where US coins have hit this mark, and the nickel is especially close right now, but this really has nothing to do with bitcoins. The key aspect is that bitcoin value is not set by law. If the government were to come out and say "bitcoins are now worth $10 by law", then this might make sense because the bitcoins would leave the country where they could get $17.30.

One large risk is bitcoin price drop. If bitcoins went back to $6, then you'd be stuck with highly specialized equipment. Another long term risk is added competition from other miners.

Let's say I operate pool A and I don't like pool B because they have lower rates than me or something. Pool B charges 2% on their pps. In pps, I get a bitcoin credit from pool B regardless of luck or anything that is going on with them solving blocks. The idea is supposed to be that over time it will all average out anyway.
But if I purposefully keep back shares that would solve the block, then this averaging doesn't happen. Snce shares that solve blocks are so infrequent, I'll only be giving up a small fraction of a bitcent by not submitting it. However, I'm getting paid for all my other shares. Assuming everyone else is honest and I have more than 2.1% of the mining pools resources, this means they will be earning coins from 97.9% of their participants but paying out for 99.99999% of their shares. This will quickly cause the pool to have less reward coin income than payouts.
Actually, now that I think about it more, you don't have to have malice against the pool operator. On an individual level, it actually makes a small amount of sense to make this choice. The reason is that you are getting paid almost in full for your hashrate, but that your hashrate is no longer adding to the network and so it helps keep difficulty down, which slightly helps you.
The motivation is not there on payment systems where you split a found block, because you want to get that block recorded as quickly as possible or else you will lose potential coins, nor could you bankrupt a competitor because rewards are necessarily higher than payouts.

The scrypt hashing function is memory dependent. This makes CPUs within an order of effectiveness as GPUs in performing the hash. The problem then is that botnets do not need a lot of specialized hardware in their network to control a large portion of the hashrate. With bitcoin, they would need a good percentage of the hacked computers to have strong video cards, and soon even that won't be enough because ASICs will overshadow any possibility for a botnet to take over. Because of the memory requirements, scrypt is also hard to put onto FPGA and ASIC, although it isn't impossible. However, the capital costs would be much higher, which creates a bigger barrier to these devices being created for litecoin, especially since there currently is little overall profitability there.

The agreement I'm talking about here is the agreement of how bitcoin exists, not how it has value. Everything has relative value, including fiat dollars, so that isn't interesting. The question is how did the currency come to be. In the case of fiat, it is by decree. In the case of gold, it is by a physical process. In the case of bitcoin, it is by agreement to the protocol that creates and tracks them.
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:53:36
Your first question is a topic that fascinates me. It's really something that if you study it, it gives a solid understanding of what value really is.
The value of a bitcoin is derived from the idea that tomorrow I will be able to spend that bitcoin for at least as much value as I put into it. So if I buy a coin today for $71, it's because I think I can get $71 of value in the future. Let's say I buy it to pay for some beef jerky on bitmit. Then the beef jerky seller is accepting the bitcoin because they believe that can get some beef jerky's amount of value out of it. This is kind of strange though because the beef jerky value isn't really $71, it's some nebulous range of things, which could include a video card from a bitcoin forum member. Then maybe that forum member wants some money, so they go to the Mt Gox market to find someone who wants to buy a coin.
But all the time people are looking at their coins going, this was worth something a few seconds ago and so it'll probably be worth something into the future.
What makes bitcoin prices rise, though, is when a lot of people start to believe this overwhelmingly and even believe in a future rise in price. When that happens, they hold their coins instead of selling them, or buy more coins than are being added to the market.

This is true for any equity, though. Changes in price are determined by a small fraction of the outstanding security.

I remember someone once has made an estimate that about 4M of the early bitcoins could easily be lost. I think it's safe to assume at least 2M.
But it's not exactly right to say that people are not selling right now. The Volume has been consistently higher than twice that before January. And consider that this is the volume in bitcoins, meaning the volume in USD is over 10x.
One aspect that I've commented on before is let's say you have Joe Early Adopter and he has $4,000/month in expenses. When the price is $20, he sells 200 btc/month. When the price is $140, he sells $28 btc/month.
The thing that is strange to me is the increased demand. I would expect that there is a fixed or slowly increasing demand in USD and so as the price goes higher, the bitcoin volume should go down. The exact opposite is happening, indicating that the higher price is due to a large increase in interest in bitcoin.

No, that's not really true. Mt Gox was the reference price of bitcoins for most people, but places like Bitmit would use the weighted 24hr average as the price (something that allowed for arbitrage in some cases). But the point is that the other exchanges that I am talking about were ones that would track to the gox price well. With Gox suspended, it makes sense to use their price as a proxy for the market rate. After all, just because Gox closes doesn't mean there isn't a market.

I'll give a little anecdote about a friend of mine who was on again off again homeless. He used to panhandle for money but eventually he switched over to another tactic because it started to work really well for him. Instead of going up to people and asking them for change, he would go up to people in smoking areas and ask if he could bum a smoke. The conversion rate was huge compared to asking for money. He said that more than half the time a smoker would give him a cigarette. He would then pocket the cigarette into a case and later sell them to other people who had been panhandling for 25c/cig.
The point of my story is this, people with motivation and a little street smarts can get around anything. Even sending them a papajohns coupon could become them selling the slices to other homeless people and then they have cash for who knows what. 
Giving them bitcoins directly actually gives them even more options. What could they do with them? Who knows. but I do believe in the power of people to be smart about acquiring what they really want.

This isn't really Bitcoinary's fault. A better title would be "Beware of sellers when using Bitcoinary."
I will also emphasize that it isn't your fault either, it's the guy that scammed you. But, as you've seen now, there are some things you can do to protect yourself in the future. When I enter into a deal with an anonymous person on the internet, I always ask "how could I scam me in this position." Even with taking this tack, I've been scammed, once on a craigslist deal not related to bitcoin at all, and once on a bitcoin deal.
When I trade with some people, I also try to educate them security. Case in point, on one local bitcoin deal, a guy wanted to use my laptop to check the transfer went through. I explained to him that he should never do this with someone because they might have a keylogger installed and then they could get access to his wallet.

I think you might be confused about something. This is a basic aspect of physics, the conservation of energy. You can take a 4W chip and improve the efficiency so that it only uses 1W, but you will still get ~1W of heat, meaning the electrical use is practically always the same amount of heat as this is where the energy goes when it is "used."

Bitcoin is still being used heavily as a value transfer mechanism. The thing is that people are just buying some bitcoin with fiat and sending them to the destination immediately, so it's not the same as spending btc savings.
That being said what is probably occurring more right now is that the people getting the btc are not cashing them in. Some certainly are, but there is more motivation to at least hold some back.

This is completely false. First of all, a better statement would have been "Anarchists lack the empathy to see why someone might need to rely on external services to survive." Using the term "state services" certainly begs the question with regards to the state. But most anarchists are very empathetic to the fact that others may need a hand up. I personally am involved with many charities both financially and from a volunteerism perspective, whereas I often find liberally to be less willing to take on this responsibility directly and more apt to simply believe it is the role of the state to care for people. But states are cruel, unforgiving, bureaucratic  monoliths and can't care for anyone except the special interests that prey on them with rent-seeking. [JP Morgan getting a cut of every SNAP payment]( is an example.
The reason you have an idea that we are not empathetic is because you equate objection to the state providing a service with objection to that service itself. The fault here lays with your myopic perception, not with voluntarism.

Generally in this thread, I support AMDs position, but this question is a little different. A GPU with even just one unit that can do a double SHA265 in a single cycle, like current ASICs, actually could have a great amount of benefit to cryptocurrencies.
Satoshi originally wanted the computing power of cryptocurrencies to be extremely decentralized to provide robustness to the network. If everyone knew about Bitcoin and had a computer that could efficiently mine them and they actually did mine with them and prevented their computers from being controlled by botnets, then the 51% attack would be pretty much impossible.
The problem, though is that is a lot of ifs. The situation we have now is that a very small percentage of computer users know about bitcoins, large populations allow their computers to be controlled by botnets, and all of those people combined that are mining really don't stack up against a well funded enemy.
Having a power efficient part of all video cards that can be called upon to do a little mining while the screen saver was on could equalize the network, but it might also hand the network over to bot herders. It's kind of hard to say.

The difficulty kind of has a maximum load based on the bitcoin price. While the return on investment time frame is low, it encourages people to buy more and more mining equipment, until the amount of money earned relative to the the capital outlay become low. At this point in time, it starts to make more sense to buy coins instead of mine them, so people turn to that and the price of coins goes up. Then it gets to where it makes sense to mine again. This oscillation has historically been seen.
However, we are solidly in miner buying time. For real offerings (not $300/GHps), it would take over $70m in order to order enough hardware to bring the ROI down to it's historical equilibrium (which still makes a lot of money, but not as much as holding bitcoins).

The nicest thing about it is that your wallet will sync across all your devices. Also, you don't have to maintain your own blockchain. The downside is that you have to have some trust in them. The system is made so that it never knows your private keys in unencrypted form, and also you can backup the keys in case they go down, so not a lot of trust is needed, but there is a little bit of third party risk.

Anyone can find a block, but finding two blocks in a row is unlikely in proportion to your hashing power. 3 in a row is even more unlikely, etc. Thus the proof of work makes everyone reasonably certain that the transaction history cannot be rewritten. With this asaurance, you can know the order of the transactions.
Without it there's no way to have a consensus on the order of transactions. Without this consensus, it is possible to introduce transactions into the network that pay one person in one part of the network while moving coins in another part.

Yeah, I took the statement that Bitpay made that they processed 6% of the black friday sales and from this I figured that the justified price is about $1b (a lot of the blockchain will be transfers). However, this is the things about speculation: it is forward looking. So right now the justification is $1b, but Bitpay also said their black friday sales were 64 times what they were last year, so if you continue that trend, saying a market cap of $64b by the end of next year isn't unrealistic. Even if that growth is high and it tapers, the current price is justified.

No one wants to hear this but there are structural differences between the dot coms and housing market and a commodity speculation like bitcoin. Dot coms and housing are forced into 0 valuation by bankruptcies and mortgagor defaults. When a company or a homeonwer run out of money, it has a real negative effect on the security backing them. *Investors had no choice but to revalue to lower or even 0 their stocks and MBS*. In the case of bitcoin, as in the case of gold, nothing forces the value to 0. This means that it can bubble to a ridiculous price and then just taper off and hold for years because people are not forced into a capitulation. Then demand catches up and it starts to rise again.
This is why it is super risky to short commodities even if they are in an obvious bubble. The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

In my experience, the concept of bitcoin is not enough to get a person to use it. Instead, a person needs to have a desire to transact in something that is better (easier, more anonymous, etc) with bitcoin; e.g. online gambling or VPN services. This gets them in the door and then they see the light. But every person's needs are different, so leave it up to the services to advertise their product.
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:52:37
It's actually pretty simple. The basic idea is to use bitcoins as a representation of something else, possibly even in the physical world, and then using the blockchain (which already has a tremendous amount of computing power securing it) to transfer the rights to these something elses with people.
So one example could be shares of google. Instead of trading GOOG on the NYSE, you could make a "GOOG shares" color and then say that .00000001 btc of this color represents a share of google. Because coin transfers can be traced in the blockchain, as long as you don't accidentally mix your colored coins in with normal coins, or with coins of another color (which presumably the client would make sure doesn't happen by having separate addresses etc for that color), then you can prove that the .00001000 "GOOG colored" coins you have give you the rights to 1000 shares of GOOG, and the consequent dividends or buyout cash that could come with that.
Another example, more physical, is that .000001 btc could represent an ounce of gold in a vault. It could even be like an ETF where the NAV of the .000001 btc goes down by .5% per year, but it still represents physical goods or securities.
Those are commodities (pretty much one oz of gold is exchangeable for another), but you could have a different color for each car in existence instead of a VIN and a title. Then the car could query the block chain for who owns it and require you to digitally sign a challenge-response with the key relating to the address that contains the colored coin representing itself before it starts. There's some cool applications that come from this.
The problem I have with it is that it seems like it will dust up the blockchain for people who just want use bitcoin for its core purpose of transferring value.
@_date: 2013-02-15 14:44:59

I think it still remains to be seen on Social security. The advantage it has is that it can use the might of the government to force participation. Another thing it has is a low promised return. The things that cause ponzis to collapse is too few people entering the system and too high a rate of return to be sustainable.
However, even with that, it seems that social security is facing a future liabilities problem that will result in either increasing payments into it or decreasing benefits. This is already on top of the fact that if a person were to invest those dollars directly into treasuries and purchase private disability and life insurance, they would get much better service.

My response is really more about rewards in general and not to do with Bitcoin. I agree generally that merchants should offer discounts for bitcoin purchases. The reason they don't is because they probably just spent a good amount of money integrating bitcoin into their shopping cart so they look at the savings in fees as a way to make that up, but offering even just a 1% incentive and pocketing the rest (typically 1.9% on top of the 1%) would likely get them a lot more people using bitcoin and thus pay off their effort to integrate bitcoin more quickly.
One thing to consider is that many credit card processing contracts explicitly forbid discount pricing for non CC transactions, although my understanding is that these clauses have been made void by the recent credit card act.

The primary value of bitcoin comes from its ability to facilitate trade. Generally, when two people get together to make a trade, both parties come out ahead of where they started. An apple farmer with will sell an apple for 50 cents because he has a lot of them, and the buyer pays it because the apple is worth at least 50 cents to them (but usually more as it is rare to find a price exactly what something is worth). In this way each trade synthesizes value to the participants. Bitcoin has features such as non-demption and pseudoanonimity that make it so that it is excellent for some trades (e.g. for virtual items like WoW gold) because it injects trust into the buyer that normally would not be there and would represent a large loss risk for the seller.

None of those things are pegged to the dollar. Bitcoins, gold, and silver are all on a floating market. It's not even possible to peg them to a fiat currency because pegging requires you to inflate or deflate the base to maintain the same ratio of value. It can be done with one fiat currency to another, but not a commodity to a dollar. You can, as you say, do the reverse, but that tends not to work out so well for governments and banksters.
Bitcoins, gold, and silver are priced in dollars, but you can price gold in bitcoins or even in half racks of cow (although racks of cow are fungible which make that harder). We just use dollars because that's what we're used to using as a common unit of value.


But ticket prices for movie theaters haven't gone from $8 to $44 since the year 2000. Pretty much they've only gone to $12. So you can get a lot more theater tickets for your oz of gold today than then. And it's not just theater tickets. Housing is practically at the same cost. Electricity is maybe 10% more. Cost of cars has come down when you talk about included features. Cost of gas has tripled, but there's other reasons for that (peak oil).  Something else must be going on with gold for it to appreciate 551%.
And still, bitcoin is like gold where its supply is limited. When there are more dollars chasing the bitcoins, then the price goes up at least proportionally. So if bitcoins are $25 today, but tomorrow a $100 buys what $1 bought today, then bitcoins are going to be $2500. I think we all understand how price inflation and real prices work. A lot of us have already experienced a difference in our lifetimes.

Cryptocurrencies in general create an entirely new market online, that where trust must be imputed to the buyer and not the seller. Because of this, it's more reasonable to believe that bitcoin or a technology like it will capture much more than 1% of online transactions because there is no technology out there that has an equivalent. Dwolla tried and got smacked down by regulation mixed with fraud.
Right now bitcoin is the market leader and litecoin is in a respectable second. All others are nonstarters.

Bitcoin is a lot nicer to donate with. You don't have to worry about identity theft or even just being harassed by the charity. I donated $50 to the ACLU in the early 2000s in some kneejerk reaction to something stupid said by Rumsfeld. I've gotten enough mailers from them to feel like my donation was net negative now.
Sometimes I'll come across something and just on a lark cut and paste them a few dollars worth of coins. I won't say that most of my donations per year are in the form of bitcoin, as we have a donation matching program at work and so I generally funnel it all through that, but all of my "on a lark not planned" donations to relatively unknown charities are via bitcoin.

I'm not really clear on what you're saying. This isn't a client function, it's a server function. You need a dynamic web server that will generate the chained address at the time the user requests it. This function isn't remotely related to a client function and it can't be in any easy way without revealing your master key. There is an exception with web clients like blockchain.info, because they have dynamic web servers as part of them.
On the other side, Armory is a client. If you mean if it's a shame that chained addresses aren't part of QT, well, QT is a reference client. I would expect other clients to have novel features while Gavin et al work on core features.

I'm talking about today. It's true that some casinos use a large **shoe**. The size of the cards in the deck are not important, but the number of decks in the shoe are, so forgive me when I found amusement at your improper phrasing. It does relate to me important information about what you actually know about how casinos operate.
The other aspect aside from the shoe size is the reshuffle rate. Even a one deck shoe can't be overcome if they reshuffle every time.
However, despite how well this is known, casinos still often operate with a beatable shoe/reshuffle combo. The reason is that in truth most people are bad a counting cards so the casinos will use their parameters as a draw for suckers who think they can keep it straight. This is especially great for the casinos because the person thinks they are beating the system so they will keep coming back and dumping money in.
Every now and then you get a person who does know how to count. These can be spotted because of their betting strategy. Once they are spotted, they get a ban, and if they come back they get criminal trespass charges. I know a guy who was banned 6 months ago from a major Vegas casino because of counting. Don't try to tell me it doesn't work now.
Personally, I play poker because I'm not so good with the counting and while I could probably practice and get my skill up, I know it's a dead end because of the bans. Plus, you can play poker at home. You can't count against an RNG.
Edit: just read your link and it pretty much says exactly what I'm saying. Note that the numbers they give is for a high-low strategy. That's a pretty basic strategy and there are much better out there.

BFL has stated in the past that they would not allow refunds after they started shipping, so this is within their stated policy.
That being said, the reason they are doing this is clear: with so much more mining power coming online in the next few months, BFL does not want their order book to become a speculative hedge. Without this policy in place, the best plan right now would be to put in a BFL order, and if you see KnC miner release something, or Terrahash units available, or ASICMiner drop block erupters to $15 or anything else, you can just cancel and go with that. REally, what BFL is saying is right now, to have a place in line, you have to make a choice.
My recommendation, as it has been for a few weeks is to not get into line. Wait a few months for the dust to settle, and it will become clear where to put your money.

It kind of depends on what tax you are referring to. A sales tax would need to be paid in the fiat amount based on the bill. The income tax would need to be paid based on the amount of fiat received when you convert bitcoins to dollars. If you don't convert bitcoins to dollars in that tax year, then you would need to use the fair value at the time of the sale, and then report any increase if bitcoin price goes up, or claim a loss if bitcoin price goes down in the tax year you sell.
Just because it's bitcoin doesn't mean you can avoid tax. A lot of people pay cash in these places and the taxes are paid.

It's not really a major problem if you pay the recommended fees.
There's no way to literally cancel it. If this transaction emptied that address, then you could double spend with a fee on the second one, but this is pretty complicated. You can speed it up by mining the transaction yourself, but that takes a bit of hardware.

Basically mining is a competitive process. If the value of Bitcoins is high, then more people will spend more money to add on more and more equipment to the network, lowering profits from everyone else. Historically, this has pretty much stayed in the range of 1/6th to 1/8th of the cost of the equipment per month, but there are times like the price crash in 2011 where miners started getting negative profits and thus shutting off their machines and also like the reward halving in November 2012 where the cashflow went from 1/6th to 1/12th overnight (but recovered due to price rise in 6 weeks). There are also times when the earnings are less than 1/6th but people have always been quick to purchase equipment until the network gets to that point. Then purchases are much slower.

There are many ways to use preorder money to fund the development of a product. The most basic way is to get a loan against the assets from the preorder money. Then if you can't deliver, you can refund the preorder money and the bank gets the hit as the creditor. The risk is why the bank gets interest, and BFLs FPGA deliveries would easily qualify them for a business loan. No one here is an accountant for BFL, so I think it's highly speculative to say they necessarily broke the law.


I'm really not happy about the bulk sales thing either, but this is a pretty gross mischaracterization of what is happening. First of all, they haven't even started accepting orders for bulk chips, they have simply announced that they will be. Second of all, those chips aren't promised delivery until 100 days after your order date.
But most importantly it ignores the fact that BFL's largest competitor, Avalon, *is already selling bulk chip sales*. And BFL is selling their chips at a higher $/GHps ratio. On top of that, the pricing is such that the $/GHps is higher than the first several months of preorders, with only the ratio being lower only after the BFL price increase.
This is a competitive market and while it's easy to say that BFL is screwing its customers, the actual situation is that Avalon is putting the screws to BFL's customers. This is all a valid risk when choosing one company over another, and this is said by a person who has a lot tied up into BFL.
One final factor is that those customers who did order at the more expensive price point, it's not too late for them to cancel. BFL has been really good with their cancellation policy. I have two friends who just ordered Jalapenos from them this past week, and I'll talk to them about all of this, but to be honest, it's not really clear what they should do. They want something at that price point and aside from the joke of an offering from ASICMiner's usb stick, there is nothing for them out there. Someone else on another forum calculated out making a Jalapeno from a bulk chip buy and with the board, ps, etc it came to only a little under the current price (but the price gets better once you go into higher GHps as the board cost is better spread out).

That's only because the geometric series of relending converges on 9 (actually on 10). The way it works is there is 1 btc deposted, and the bank lends .9 to joe, who spends it and then that person deposits the .9 btc, that lends out .81 btc, that is spent and deposited, and then lent out as 0.729 btc. Already we have 3.439 btc from just the one bitcoin. Using the geometric series of sums, it works out that the total after all the cycles comes to 10 coins.
It's not even necessary for all the participants to deposit at the same bank as long as money is cycling around and being lent out with the same capital limits (in this case 1/10 on reserve).

Actually, on December 10th, they said the foundry was supposed to deliver the chips in 30 days. This would make that delivery date January 9ths. Then they would need to take the chips and give them to their assembly company (they are outsourcing the initial run) and get the full units back. In addition, they have said that the trade in people will get 2 weeks notice so that they can trade their units in ahead of the shipping date. This indicates that it will not be until at least January 23rd that they start shipping, and this is for the preorders from June, and the OP ordered today.
If they start shipping on the 23rd (I'm still a little doubtful, the foundry can still screw them), then I would say this order would come in in March.

Bitcoins are literally just an entry in a ledger that states "such and such address is allowed to spend X number of bitcoins." When you spend coins, you sign a new message with the key for that address, proving you are the one who controls is saying "I am reducing my total amount by Y and adding it to this other address." Then everyone with a full client updates their ledger to decrease your bitcoin total by Y and increase the other address total by Y.
What miners do is order the transaction through a distributed trust system. Putting transactions in order is a mathematically hard problem, and the trust comes in that with so many people putting the transactions in order, that someone cannot come from behind and reorder all the transactions. This is important because if I spend coins to you and then spend coins to me, the system will reject the second transaction. If miners confirm the spend to you first, then you get the coins. If you given me the good I was paying for, and then I maliciously try to come from behind and change the ordering to where the transaction sending coins to me is first, then suddenly the act of me giving you coins will be undone.
The solving of the equation is more competitive than co-operative. The parameters are different for each miner because part of what they are solving involves assigning new coins to their own address. The key aspect of what they are solving is that it combines the transactions they are processing together into a number, and then combining that with another piece of data trying to get a result under a target. It's important that the transactions are part of this work, otherwise it would not be useful in adding trust to the ordering of transactions.

The high value of gold is not based on its industrial use but on its perceived ability to store value. This ability to store value came from there being nothing else that had the same resistance to counterfeiting/duplication,  fungibility, etc. But the creation of cryptocurrencies has changed that. When litecoin is made beside bitcoin, it doesn't just affect Bitcoin value, but also affects gold value. So the fact that gold can't be duplicated chemically is no longer relevant because the necessary qualities of gold needed to store value could be duplicated by a cryptocurrency.

Each time you specifically generate an address, it's about (number of addresses)/2^256 chance that you will collide. That's pretty remote.

I think the disconnect here is that because the price gains we've experienced have been so high, people actually think that it will always be the case that you can keep your rock for a week and get a new knife instead of a rusty one. This really isn't sustainable and the gains we have now are only because we are in an adoption phase. Bitcoin isn't even deflationary yet: about $3,600,000 is created every single day.
So let's ask again you can trade that rock for a rusty knife or you can wait a year and get a new one. Then what do you do? Well, it kind of comes down to why you want the knife. If you need to cut somethings now, then waiting a year isn't going to work.

The value is established through the supply and demand of coins at exchanges. The most popular exchange is Mt Gox and is typically used as the reference value. You can see a list of exchanges and information regarding their trading at [bitcoin watch](
There are no assurances to the soundness of this value, in the same way that the value of gold could drop out tomorrow. Bitcoins are bought with the faith that they will be able to be used to later buy that much in value. In practice, for various reasons it's actually common to find even more value in bitcoin transactions than you would have had if you transacted in fiat.

Aside from the SR not working that way, blockchain.info only stores the IP of the address that relays the transaction to it, not the address of origination.

It's really different. Buying a miner would be an investment because you are inputting something with the hope of creating something in the future for profit (i.e. you are validating transactions necessary for the bitcoin system to work, and getting block rewards and tx fees).

Moore's law has nothing to do with it, and is bounded by physics anyway. Even if every atom on on earth were a transistor in a supercomputer, it would not be able to crack the encryption.
That should give an idea of how impressive quantum computers are, because they are a bit of a challenge. However, in order to crack your way into an address that has never been spend on, you would need to break 3 encryption algorithms, 2 of which have proven resistance to quantum computing.
If you have spent coins from an address, then you have published that address's public key to the blockchain, so only one algorithm needs to be attacked. This is bad, but as Miner_Willy said, it can be swapped out.

People are focusing on the word "CPU" but that might just be a gaff. 
The fact is, though, that there is no such "price". That is because as a miner you have to consider these ratios in synchronizity:  
- the number of hashes per second per dollar cost of the hashing unit (Hps/$)  
- the number of hashes per second per Watt (Hps/W or H/WH)  
- cost of your electricity ($/WH)  
- the expected number of bitcoins per hash (goes lower as difficulty goes higher) (btc/H)  
- the number of dollars you can sell one bitcoin for ($/btc)
On top of that, you say "worthwhile" and that is also an unknown. What is worthwhile to you? A lot of people feel it isn't worthwhile to put in $7300 to make $20/day (that gives 100% ROI in 1 year) because their money is tied up in a machine for a year and so they don't see any return for a long time, plus they take on the risks of bitcoin price falling and difficulty rise, and the future impending reward halving.

I might be wrong, but i don't think that coinbase is an exchange. There's no way for a user to set a price to buy at, and there's not book of asks and bids to be resolved against each other. The price coinabse lists is based on exchanges, so it couldn't be used to set the price.

Most of us have a lot more experience with bitcoin as being reasonably stable. Although there were some high volatility events in 2012, mostly the daily range would be within 5%. It's only recently that we've been having 10-100% upwards and 10-70% downward daily movements. The problems with volatility come from speculation getting out of hand, which is going to happen at these low prices. But even when it's volatile, it's still useable as a money transfer mechanism (i.e. still good for buying stuff pseudonymously and without reversability). When there was &lt;5%volatility, it was really easy to use it as currency. Now that we've had a crash

The idea that fiat derives value from taxes is a common internet misinterpretation of MMT. This is true when the government issues and consumes dollars as part of a tax cycle, but it is not true for a fiat currency like the US dollar that is managed by a central bank and is created and destroyed by a debt and repayment cycle. In this model, the government is just a user of dollars like any other person in the economy and it is not the value that comes from the fact that the government is asking for taxes in it, but that the government asks for taxes in it because it has value. A simple illustration of this is that if your mansion is worth $400,000, then you will get a $10,000 tax bill, but if your mansion is worth $4,000 as it was in the 1910s, then you will get a $10 tax bill. Thus the value of the dollar determines the demand level in taxation, not the other way around. The reason the US dollar retains value is because it can be used to discharge debts, which are ultimately how the dollars were constructed in the first place.
@_date: 2013-03-27 13:24:51
I agree with you, but we have to move through a lot of $/btc levels before we can find a stability. If bitcoin is going to be used for 1% of the things it does well at (system D, ecomerce, wealth store), it needs to be in the $10,000 range. The recent up movement is just part of that.

Not for nothing, but those really aren't the same. The grandparent was using a kanji transliteration of the entire words, which came out to say "Central Region Gather Information." It's a pretty big coincidence. By comparison, simply taking component syllables and finding companies that start with them is really just making things up, especially when two of those companies have names in the same language as Satoshi's name, and that Japanese is kind of restrictive in what sounds can be made. Plus the phrase you said makes no sense in any context unless there is some kind of conglomerate of these 4 companies.
However, I will say that this still proves nothing. Satoshi has always been proven to be forward thinking, and for all we know, this is just an inside joke to him.

Well, I wasn't addressing you, not have I seen any posts wher eyou detail in full your story in this subreddit (for example, were you ever credited with bitcoins in your coinbase account). I saw your comment about allowing people to be able to wire in the money to cover it. I did vote that up, but I'm reserved on that. I guess I feel that then people could game the system where they wire the funds when the value goes up but don't when the value goes down. It is better to have a policy that is objective and you can reference in a case where fraud is suspected and then treat all cases the same way and to not let the user alter the decision path as allowing them to do that opens you up to losses.
Outside of that, I do take exception to Vibr8gKiwi who originally said one thing in his post when I first read it and has significantly changed his story to a final edit in that post, and then posts again about it. His circumstances don't really garner much support from me as they never took the money.

I read about them doing this after [making this post]( and I have to say that I am concerned.

It's not really the case on a day-to-day basis, but more on a moth to month basis. Every month, I copy all of my transactions from my various places and put them into a tracking spreadsheet, and then I reconcile all of the purchases made to make sure that I've really made them. I've been doing this since 2006, well before I knew about bitcoin. But then again, I've been the victim of credit card number theft in the past (in 2002, and again in 2005, and then my niece again in 2007), so maybe I'm not the best person to ask.
With bitcoin, I kind of have to do this too (after all, a hacker might get access to my keys and spend from them), but it's actually a little more as you go. When I personally make a bitcoin transaction, it pops up a notification of such which I can dismiss because I know I just did that. If such a transaction happens when I'm not there, then I'll be notified as such and know immediately. Thus I don't really have to do reconciliations.
Edit: okay, here's my honest question. Doesn't it worry you, just a little, that Amazon retains the details of all your credit cards? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to load money into amazon without having to give up this financial control?
Edit2: as weird as this sounds, this is why I will always use the paypal option if a site has it even though I hate that scumbag of a company. I'd rather use their horrible service than have to spread my info around.

Quite the opposite. ASICs make it so that botnet herders have much less ability to take over the bitcoin network. If [this botnet ]( were to put all of the CPUs and GPUs directly towards mining it would be 4THps on the low end (no GPUs), 12THps on the high end (10% GPUs). Add on a second botnet and you have a compromised network. A targeted trojan (e.g. one built into a release of a popular high end game) could quickly rack up hashing power. 
ASICs are not owned by one entity, they are owned by many different people across the globe. ASIC owners will notice if their ASICs are repurposed by a botherder, but GPU owners would not. Because of this ASICs are the way forward.

As you can see in [this post]( I've experienced the same thing in fiat. People thinking you have money often can change their attitude towards you when they get into a financial bind. Some people said that it sounds like you have bad friends, but I think it's just a part of human nature. Part of being friends is accepting these kinds of flaws. Doesn't mean it's any easier.

This is exactly true. The biggest example is the Trendon Shavers/pirateat40 Bitcoin Savings and Trust.

I'm more tending to A, but I think it will overshoot $20 into the $22 area and come back down. I feel pretty strongly that these prices have support and are not a bubble.
The thing is though, that when bitcoin hits these price stabilization points, it lingers there for a month or so. This seems to give people even more faith and this pushes the price farther. Eventually we will cross $50, but it would be silly to try to predict when. I do believe that by the end of August, we will have crossed the high in the $32s.

I was primarily in bitcoin for the poker. I didn't mind so much on the way up because not only was I making btc, but that btc was increasing in fiat. However, once the price started dropping, I couldn't really win enough to make up for the currency losses. I pulled out all my money from the site I was using and sold off at $11. 
Meanwhile I was mining and the price drop was cutting into profitability. As the price hit $4, the difficulty started to drop. In some kind of weird coincidence, it was able to reduce right at the line where my power costs coincided with the earnings. Maybe sometimes I mined at a loss, but never more than 5% and I still wanted to support the network. Even if Wired didn't believe in Bitcoin, I still did.
I bought back in (in a big way) at around $5 (after it hit $7 and came down, though). At that time it seemed like stability was back and I just wanted stability, not appreciation.

This depends on where you live, both because of solar insolence, and because of the cost of electricity. I do know that without the government rebate, grid tied solar panels using microinversion have an ROI of 10 years. With the government rebate, it's 6.6 years. This is effectively a 15% annual return which is pretty good, and really only gets better over time as the power company increases the cost of power (historically 5% increase annually). One thing though is to first put in a solar water heater system. I did this and it paid on in under 2 years. Another thing is to try to reduce your load where you can, e.g. with LED or CFL bulbs, so you don't overbuy a system.

The Finance world thrives on these barriers to entry to keep small timers out. The laws are there ostensibly to save people from themselves, but they really act as protectionism.
25k really isn't that high of a barrier. This is the same amount you need to have an account that allows day trading (buying and selling any securities in the same day 3 times over 5 days). The real problem is that you need to be accredited which is either a 200k salary or $1m in the bank.

It's certainly possible, but you would need a client that supported the salt.
An example salt could be a different number to increment by on the elliptical curve. Right now it's (last_pk,last_pk's y) + 1\*P. Instead this could be  (last_pk,last_pk's y) + salt\*P. As long as salt is sufficiently high (e.g. in the range of 2^128 - 2^256), it would take too long to compute.

This apparently isn't what user24 was thinking, but there is another important long term affect. In reality, these "rewards" are creating a game theory scenario like the prisoners dilemma, where everyone's individual actions seem to benefit them personally, but when taken as a whole actually cause everyone detriment. The money for the rewards come from somewhere and that place is from the fees charged to the merchants with enough taken off the top to give the credit card company a profit. Because the merchant is paying these fees, they need to raise their prices, and the long term net effect of a 5% discount is that everyone pays 6% more.

I agree with this statement, and it was kind of my point in stating the market caps of gold and S&amp;P500.
However, I personally just don't see people abandoning all fiat everywhere for bitcoin. I agree in stressed areas like Argentina and India, some people will try to acquire it, but there are lots of other assets they could try to acquire along side bitcoin.But the question is, will they treat it as a currency or will they treat it as a savings vehicle and convert to a local currency when needed. It's even questionable to me that bitcoin would be used in this way at all because of the technical limitations of the blockchain. More likely people would have regional altchains they could use in day to day life and then settle exchanges between areas in bitcoin.
But all this is futurecasting, which is notoriously hard to do.

Everything I've seen is that central banking policy is completely indifferent to the existence of gold and its use as an asset. They don't want a gold standard, where they would need to allow for the redemption of their printed dollars for gold, but gold it's value in the marketplace is not something they need to fight against. The vast majority of people are not shoving all of their savings into gold.

It's a cumulative graph of the order book. If you have someone selling 50 coins at 45 and then another 100 coins at 45.10 and then another 100 at 45.20, you would see the graph stepping up by that number of coins at the respective dollar amount. Then someone might have a 10k sale at 45.50 and this would have a big vertical line up to 10,250 because it's that 10k, plus the 250 from before.
On the left side is the same thing but bids to buy bitcoins for a certain dollar amount.

Yeah, the numbers are looking pretty good. Like I said in my original post, that's because the price of bitcoin has risen so much recently. Returns are now better than they were when the block reward was 50 bitcoins.
Another aspect you have to consider is the risk of a bitcoin crash and then being stuck with specialized hardware that is useless. Traditionally, people haven't had much of an appetite for this beyond a 6 month return on investment, and so network hashrate only slowly grows once this mark is met.

This actually becomes true when inflation goes into the double digits. People do actually stop selling land and gold and other commodities for an inflationary currency when they see that currency is failing.
The thing with bitcoin is that people see the value spiking like it is and are somehow extrapolating it as an exponential curve into the future. Eventually there will be enough value in the coins to equilibrize the price so that the large gains we are seeing will not happen. The number of inflows will match the outflows as people run out of fiat savings to put towards bitcoin. When that happens, commerce will commence as normal.
When it comes to more inflationary currencies, it is the goal of the central bank to affect policy that keeps this inflation low. People just don't have faith that market forces can also give a (long term) stability through equilibrium because people have been conditioned that central control is the only solution to all problems.

Even 26nm chips seem to be in competition with Avalon. I've read that 26nm FPGA is about the same as a 130nm ASIC in terms of W/hash.
However, BFL is using a 65nm process, so I'm a little doubtful these will compete. Then there is also the capital outlay ($/hash) which might make these prohibative. The mining manufacturer does not own the IP for the chip, and these chips can do a lot more than is needed, so they would have to pay the markup on each one.

Bitcoin imputes trust onto the buyer of the transaction, unlike credit cards that impute trust onto the seller. This allows sellers confidence in markets with a high rate of fraud, such as the online trade of virtual items and trade into the 60 countries worldwide that are unserviced by banks due to buyer risk. In these transactions sellers are certain they will receive the full value for the good and services they are providing.

If you at the original post, you'll see that [some comments noted it was just luck]( After looking into it more, slush hit a patch of 160% luck which caused the hashrate calculation to shoot up.  The network hashrate is not observed but is calculated based on the solve time. Pool luck is calculated based on observed shares and how many they should have solved versus how many they actually did solve. Thus luck of 160% would appear as if at least 60% of the slush rate was coming online, more if the luck was concentrated within the 24hr period.
Avalon only has 2 units received and ASICMINER is still building (but are close), BFL is making noise about a possible slippage into the week of the 18th, there's no word on Carnisaur, and CAN-Elecric is probably a scam. It's too early to expect ASIC hashrates.

I think of bitcoin as an alternative currency, not a replacement for USD. I think the transaction limits on bitcoin make it impossible to use for every transaction in a country the size of the US.
That being said, I think your first objection is thinking too much in the current state of bitcoin technology. For example, smart chip technology could have it so that a person's keys are copied onto a card and when they go shopping, the register asks the card to sign a transaction and it puts it out there after validating it. The user doesn't need an internet connection, only the terminal they are using to load and unload the card does. The card's keys can be backed up to a cloud with a password, and the card resent with the user needing to unlock it at a kiosk or something if it is ever lost or stolen, or possible entering their pin/password every time they spend/load. There's lots of things that can be done.
On the second point, financial collapse of a currency doesn't erase luxuries, it just makes them more expensive nominally. The point is that if there is a loss of faith in, say, the dollar as the world reserve currency and the value collapses 100 fold over night, that won't happen to bitcoin. When the dollar demand collapses, the nominal price of bitcoins will skyrocket. If you're talking about a complete collapse scenario, then you'll want ammunition, firearms, and packaged food but that's a separate topic.
@_date: 2013-01-31 19:14:21
I understand your post just fine. They aren't stealing gains, they cancelled your transaction because it was suspicious. They accepted an order from you and decided not to fulfill the order. This is their right of free association and they need to do this because, for whatever reason, your order looked highly risk and they need to protect themself against that.
It's too bad you missed out on your $41.80 because you look suspicious but claims that coinbase steals money are patently false. that combined with the ridiculously low value of your transfer are why your whining is tiring. It's common in the bitcoin world that when transferring fiat into bitcoin that things get fucked up because the fiat world is rife with chargebacks and clawbacks and all sorts of nasty things that make it hard to deal with from a fraud perspective. 
But you don't fucking care! You'd rather coinbase lose their ass end out to nigerian fraudsters because you lost under $50 due to some unknown aspect about yourself that made you look risky. Your lack of empathy returns the same.

The prior rally had the fear behind it that bitcoin was a flash in the pan. However, with so many sites now relying on bitcoin income streams, it's clear that this is not going anywhere. Plus, with that crash, the history shows Bitcoin recovered, so now if it does drop, people are going to be less willing to sell. After all, anyone who did sell then is now ostensibly wrong.
Another aspect is that bitcoin is now being securitized in hedge funds. These funds typically just buy a shit load of a commodity and sit on it for years to see what happens.

If they sustain the hashrate on the pool it's not pointless. It shows that they are not using it for transaction reordering. Even if they did use it to reorder transactions, they can't fully do this surreptitiously as it will become clear when their submitted blocks start orphaning others.

The inflation actually works against the value. As more coins are minted, the value of the existing coins is divided into the new coins. However, the inflation rate is predictably known, so the anticipation of this is often baked into the price.
However, on the other side you have adoption. The inflation rate is about 12.5% annually. If you have more than 12.5% growth in the usage of bitcoin, then the price is going to go up.
On top of that, you have existing user's comfort. If the existing user base is willing to increase their bitcoin holding by more than 12.5% per year, then the value goes up.
There are a few factors that influence those two things. I think that the Kim Dot Com announcement is a lot bigger than people give it credit for. If you look at the price chart, there is a clear inflection point where he made those tweets in support of bitcoin. Kim Dot Com is kind of an internet celebrity and a celebrity endorsement is big. People who feel they can't make an opinion of the technical metir themselves will defer to his judgement because of their view of him as a savvy internet person.

For PPS, you get paid regardless of if a block is ever found.

At the end of November, the bitcoin reward for miners halved. For a month or so people probably had their stores, plus some speculators would have stored up some. The price rose a little, from 11 to 13.50 and hung out for a while, and people sold out of their stores. Now they're sold out and this is putting pressure on the buy side. Every now and then, the price will hit a point where a long term position will cash out, probably because they bought in the great run up of 2011 but maybe just because a value point is met.

First of all, don't just blindly send it back if you don't know who sent it. The funds could have come from a wallet pool like Mt Gox and not a person who would have control over the funds. Blind refunding doesn't work.
IMO, you should only refund it to a person who can sign a message with the originating key. This still sucks for those that were transferring from Gox or whatever, but as you can see from the comments, anyone can claim it was them.

The best way to get bitcoins is to earn them by providing goods and services.
If you can't do that, and you see goods or services that have an advantage while using bitcoins, then yes, exchanging them for your local currency is the best route.

is right about the input/output thing, but it seems to me that Multibit used [this transaction]( of 100 coins as the input.
I don't know much about the Multibit source code, but I suspect that it goes through the input transactions in chronological order to build up the inputs. If you look in the list of trnsactions, before the +100, you moved out all the coins that were in there (120 btc) so the wallet was empty. Then when you transferred the 12 coins, it wen to pick enough inputs to add up to above 12. Well, the first one there was 100, so it satisfied it, and it broke it up into the 12, 87.999 and .001 tx fee transfers to make 100 btc.

When you say the market's capacity to absorb them, you are really specifically saying what is the aggregate desire to savings by this amount. The miners are the first line of this, but miners could sell to people trying to stash cash.

What I think is they should have a fraud policy and apply it consistently regardless of price movements and that it is okay that you missed an opportunity because an aspect of your transfer triggered against this policy.

The difference in value is called [goodwill]( Bitcoin has it because of the first mover advantage, press, and number of users and business trading in it. You can copy the bitcoin source code, but you can't copy the goodwill.

You should invert it and do oz/BTC. Otherwise smaller numbers are better for BTC holders (less bitcoin needed to buy an ounce of gold). 
In that case, Jun 2011 is 0.020751 oz/btc, versus 0.020685 oz/btc today.

I'm responding to what you said, not what you hoped you said. If you think this discussion is solely about online games, then I understand your position, but I think it is a flawed response to GSpotAssassin who never limited his activity to online only.
The cases that have been reported where people have made money at roulette, the person was using a clicker device in their shoe. Casinos do look for this, but it's still pretty hard to detect.

I think the point of an address is you want third parties to access it. If you wanted to send me money, you would use the "fjordo" address.
Yes, it still uses long numbers under the name. This is a security feature of bitcoin and would be risky to remove.

No. You will get scammed by a person who does a paypal reversal. Just don't go there. There's a reason the prices are inflated, and then there's a reason why people are willing to "pay" that price.
