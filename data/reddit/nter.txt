a capital one 360 p2p payment is to a bank account only, if a card comes with one, you can send to that, and the 3 p2p payments need to be completed within 45 days actually.

this isn't FUD, like this post i also advise users to not store bitcoin in an exchange account since you don't have full control of it and your bitcoin/account can be frozen and has.

your first 3 links are over 1 and 2 years old, for link 1 the OP's email account got compromised and his wallet backup was in there, for link 2 blockchain.info [addressed]( it, for link 3 the OP accidentally sent his bitcoin to the wrong address, and for link 4 their DNS registrar was compromised, not blockchain.info.
2FA was never cracked, the 3 outdated links concern the old retired wallet, so once again FUD and not even relevant if you had actually fact checked the links. you're not aware at all of how their wallet actually is, as other users have pointed out too.

@_date: 2016-11-04 22:27:46
those are online custodial/exchange accounts only meant for buying and selling, not as personal wallets for storing bitcoin since you don't have full control of it and your bitcoin/account can be frozen and has.
e.g.  is an online/web personal wallet you have full control of.

per your post you added your new card to coinbase, which is why the charge happens. card purchases from coinbase show completely as "coinbase cheapside gb" and their card processor is in the UK. you can contact coinbase to confirm all.
@_date: 2017-04-27 01:54:59
buying $0.50 btc isn't available or worth it when the current transaction miner fee alone is more than that, why that low isn't sold.

yep but .com isn't the explorer or wallet and doesn't show transactions, .info is the correct domain for them.

the transaction just confirmed earlier and now blockr shows the transaction correctly.

OP asked


no exchange, e.g. coinbase, offers buying bitcoin with paypal.
@_date: 2016-09-15 20:03:07
the premium paid is actually 20% (lowest) and higher (common) for selling legitimate gift/prepaid cards to buy bitcoin since they can't be used on bitcoin exchanges and are hard to liquidate and the seller can keep their identity private.
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:08:16
the current default fee is enough, ignore the message, gyft/bitpay is wrong, you're fine and it's not stuck.

your blockchain.info wallet recovery phrase is the master seed from which your private keys are derived.

your clients can buy bitcoin with their card from an exchange and send you bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:57:07
buying bitcoin with card has high fees, and with paypal has higher. the fees are reasonable due to the risk and rarity of the payment method.
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:16:06
my point is advice for others. i myself have warned others about blockchain.info phishing sites before.

virwox TOS doesn't allow underage users, the only sites for such users to buy bitcoin are p2p escrow sites such as localbitcoins and paxful. no site and no one does ~10% fees to buy bitcoin with paypal, especially for no ID, rather 20% to 30%+ fees on the two sites mentioned.

i'm only logging in from my computer. i've never checked the box.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:48:57
i mean, also allow a user to purchase online, so no scan needed.
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:23:57
your transaction should already be confirmed a while ago.
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:18:15
coinbase is 18+ too.
@_date: 2015-04-16 01:26:16
how long does it take support to respond?  also has users mentioning no reply from support.

coinbase doesn't support Wyoming state...
@_date: 2015-04-17 17:19:13
you didn't acknowledge my other points so i wonder if they will be considered at all. also not acknowledged is the number of days that have gone by with no response from support whom i've written off now. thanks at least for helping to drill down to the root of the issue.
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:05:17
no, it's already auto checked, i uncheck it since i don't want to be remembered, especially for that long, and i don't know if i can unwhitelist or reduce the number of days, so can i? and must the box be checked to prevent the message and texted code?

can you expand your starbucks method to other chains/services like the ones offered on your  site (walmart/amazon, etc.) and enable the process to be carried out on just your website, no need for an app.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:20:28
in the USA you can't.
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:56:56
the number of days be should be at most 30 instead of 60, there is still a risk to the user.
@_date: 2015-04-16 19:59:20
my point is that on the log in webpage there should be text that a country code is required, to inform those not aware, it being pretty obvious for everyone is assumptive.
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:44:54

you can't buy bitcoin with card on gemini.
@_date: 2016-10-30 03:10:25
you can't buy bitcoin with paypal on coinbase, only sell.
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:49:21
it's not, i checked for EUR too, and comparing SEPA isn't correct since circle doesn't have it, debit card is the correct comparison for circle vs coinbase.
@_date: 2016-10-17 05:23:29
coinbase doesn't allow neither and is even stricter with auto tracking transactions.
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:26:59
so i take it i can't unwhitelist or reduce. can this feature be added?
other points for Xapo to consider: there should be an auto email confirmation of support receiving a user's message. there shouldn't be a webpage hangup when Xapo is processing a user's verification. there should be an indication of the mobile number format required on the log in webpage. there should be a higher welcome and referral bonus.

or for darknet markets/vendors/drugs from your posting history which circle doesn't allow either.

doubtful by OP's username and posting history.
@_date: 2016-10-14 00:14:38
he's not wrong, there are scam sites and traders that chargeback or don't send paypal after getting the bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-11 16:37:17
outdated and applies to exchanges like localbitcoins as seen by the post and [comment]( in there.
circle allows it per their [user agreement](


coinbase allows it too per their rep who [commented](
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:14:33

@_date: 2016-10-17 21:42:22


coinbase is far from it.
@_date: 2016-10-31 06:37:28
coinbase is hardly the best wallet, it's only meant for buying and selling, not as a personal wallet for storing bitcoin since it's a custodial/exchange account which means coinbase can freeze your bitcoin/account and has.
@_date: 2016-10-08 02:48:44




@_date: 2016-10-25 08:01:59
the bitcoin price rate circle uses is different from the one breadwallet uses, which is why the GBP worth of the same btc amount differs, this is normal for one exchange/wallet vs another. 1% is hardly a tasty margin for the convenience of instantly buying and getting bitcoin close to the price rate by card.
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:35:20


they don't.

hardly the same, circle is 1% above spot price and still cheaper than coinbase and their 1.49%/3.99% fee and 0.50% above spot price total.
@_date: 2017-05-13 07:06:32
20% for prepaid card is standard and not ridiculous on paxful and other such sites, higher is charged too.
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:27:13
circle shows that but it's not the case anymore, plus your balance is 0, if you test circle now or search the sub you'll find out.

your answer about the message doesn't help since i'm not using second factor, or an authenticator app, or your mobile app. i simply want to be able to log in Xapo on my computer without getting a code texted each time due to that message. and i still didn't get a response from support.

buying $2 btc isn't available or worth it when to send it the current transaction miner fee alone is more than that, why that low isn't sold.

you control your private keys and wallet with blockchain.info and bitpay.
@_date: 2017-05-11 23:01:56


because you keep opening accounts, you're allowed only one and if gets closed by coinbase you can't open another one.
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:21:18
that applies to the USD wallet, Hawaii is the only state that coinbase doesn't support for bitcoin.

circle can transfer to a bank account the next business day too.
@_date: 2017-05-13 07:54:18

if the bitcoin was for darknet markets/vendors/drugs from your posting history, then that's why, circle doesn't allow it.


same reason as before, and you're allowed to add a card only in your name to your account.

not really, that comes to 1.11% spread and it's currently lower, circle has 1% spread.

@_date: 2017-05-07 18:46:20
1. yep.
2. when you send bitcoin from coinbase to your wallet address, coinbase sees its balance and transactions, so can others with your address, this is standard.
3. the closer the rate to google. coinbase and others all have a price markup.
@_date: 2017-05-28 06:38:15
no, circle dropped bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:28:32

edit: scam site and scammer OP and post and comments are being shilled and vote manipulated.
don't publicly post about trying or a transaction since a scam site or scammer will keep up their end so as to get others to try. this also happens privately when trying small amounts so as to get you to try larger amounts.

yep, as mentioned the formula for transaction size is (number of inputs * 148) + (number of outputs * 34) + 10
so (2\*148)+(2\*34)+10=374 bytes which reflects the Size shown by blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:15:42
no the country is important to know for it being supported by the site...

you got an amazon gift card for anonymity, which is why sellers charge extra since it's not money and it's anonymous plus other factors, but if you don't want to pay for that you won't get bitcoin, good luck.

their backlog has been going on for days but the network hasn't been congested for days and isn't currently.
what you said isn't even relevant.
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:26:39
it doesn't say that, that's why you can't copy and paste that. everyone can read for themselves and see the facts vs your mistruths and insults. i can also quote and link reddit comments from blockchain.info employees for further proof of the facts.
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:52:48
the network isn't busy right now and blocks aren't full.
you don't need priority fee for blockchain.info , just use current regular fee or customize fee for lower.
