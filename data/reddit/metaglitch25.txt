I really hope you’re joking with this comment.

To be honest, I have a hard time believing if that person really didn't open a Payday loan considering how some users are on this subreddit.

What's the question?
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:26:29
That's 3 times they brought it up... let's see how high we can go lol!

Looks stable now, but I was having anxiety watching that rollercoaster ��

I really hope you're joking...

Can someone explain what makes the price do whatever is happening right now? Has been rubberbanding between $9300 and $9500 for the past 10 mins, jumping up and down $50 to $100 every 2 seconds. Just trying to get edumacated ��

Seriously though. The only way to get rid of racism is to just stop calling every damn thing racist and get over it.
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:23:24
Here they go again... He's here to talk about cryptocurrency and the economy. Why is race even involved?

It's been so long I can't remember the full details. But basically they robbed me of $200+ due to fees for things that should never have existed. I fought it with my banks help and got most of it back, but not all of it.

If these scammers are truly funneling out their Bitcoin, what's to stop them from putting it right back in under their true name (if they faked theirs) or a partners name and get even more profit?

Same, they are shady. I use Edge which is mainly wallet support, and they use Wyre to buy and sell through. Literally had nothing but issues each time I used Coinbase, and never actually got anything from them because of the issues. With edge, I got only a few issues which support staff quickly and kindly helped me through (unlike Coinbase who were just assholes).

Automated seling probably. But good news, doubt they hit lows set for automated buying, and thus we will finally break $12k since they don't have anything to sell again.
PS: I base this on nothing, and have no idea if anything I said is correct... ��

That crazy twist if Satoshi's identity reveal is because he's also the co-creator of Bakkt and is supporting it all with his Bitcoin

Way to jynx it.

It's sad that it works.... But also max out your cards buying it too. Bankruptcy won't kill your credit... and when we're rich from Bitcoin, who's really going to care about their credit?
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:08:50
Nice, you BTFD ��
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:04:52
If you think this is bad, look at some of the altcoins...
