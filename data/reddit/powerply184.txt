so much excuses in your argument. If you invested 250 in the last year it would have earned you over 100usd plus in that time. so stop with the excuses man. you just spent so much time here telling yourself that you can't do it. wow.

I like coinbase. I have a high weekly buy limit and they haven't stranded me yet. So you guys want to be rebels not give up any information but want high limits? sorry, that's not how it works. They provide a service so they have to follow the laws of each state or country they do business in.

i don't know what you are talking about. i still use instant buy on coinbase using my visa.
