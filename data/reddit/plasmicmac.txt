5 BTC?
i mean, $100,000 is a lot of money. you would pay $65,000? i guess if you can afford to pay $50,000, then more power to you. it IS only $80,000. well, good luck to whoever takes the $110,000. $25,000 can change someone’s life.
enjoy your $8million.

didn’t think the math was wrong but i think the phrasing is more clear on this new answer.
basically, you only need to get to 90 to break even at that point, not 100.
makes sense.

coin stats has a nice widget feature in addition to the app. almost every coin i can think of.

i did the same but bought at $17.6k. 
that’s the risk of investing. just HODL because a $300 price change is nothing. look at the past year.
and put on your shittin’ pants...

i think the point of what everyone is saying is that you need to do research before throwing skin in the game. you jumped in and were concerned you made a mistake when what you did was completely normal.
a mistake would be if you bought at the all time high and then sold once it went on a dip because you freaked out. that’s what HODL means: understand market corrections and don’t freak out.
yes, the community here can be toxic, but it’s also helpful. because people who get in the game without understanding the basic rules and trends are the ones who make it so chaotic.
if you posed this question before throwing in $$$, you’d get a very different answer from here.
(also, calm your jets. you’re coming off as a kid who got his feelings hurt by the internet people.)

can you explain how that math is right?
if the value of one is still $80 after the second purchase, then the value you have together is $160, but you paid $180. your value per coin is still $80/each. but you’ve paid an average of $90/each. so the loss percentage is less, but the worth is whatever you can sell for at the time.
if i bought 1 at 1million and 1 when it drops to 0.01, they aren’t worth 500k now.  they’re worth 0.02 total.
