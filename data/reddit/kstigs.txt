Bitcoin is the preferred currency for illegal online transactions. That value isn't going away because some countries ban it. Saying it will atrophy and die because it's decreed illegal is the extraordinary claim (not to mention the very claim that it will be made illegal in the first place).
What useful cryptographic systems have atrophied and died because some countries made it illegal? The biggest threat to Bitcoin is weaknesses in its own fundamentals and/or the discovery/invention of far superior cryptocurrency that renders bitcoin obsolete.

Your sarcasm is appreciated. Your question has to do with economics and without any background in economics, you won't even understand an answer given to you. 
Demonstrate that you're not just an Internet troll and maybe I'll point you in the right direction. The Bitcoin wiki is probably a good place to start or you could try just googling your question.

We won't end up in the same place we are now with USD. For starters, unlimited USD can be put into circulation by the Federal Reserve. There are a finite number of Bitcoins that will ever exist. 
There are many other differences, but really, you should do some research on your own if you think you know enough to comment on it...

You were working with the company in question which means you have a clear conflict of interest.
In the above screenshot, you will see that the top thread in the forum listing is a thread stating "time to move to our new home" in which someone with your username is the OP. Are we supposed to believe that is a coincidence?

You "help out with stuff here and there" means that you work for them. Whether you're being paid or not is irrelevant.
