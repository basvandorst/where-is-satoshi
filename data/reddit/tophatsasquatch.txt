I think if Walmart could get some kind of Bitcoin service going it would be huge, like loadable BTC cards or kiosks or something.

How are people planning on storing their Trezor? In a drawer, on your keychain? I keep thinking that I would lose it if I had one.

Sorry to hear about your aunt.  I would use Gyft, you'd be able to pick a store in your price range.  I have a cheap suit from Target that gets the job done most of the time, or you could do Banana Republic or Gap.
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:47:01
I thought it was plenty intuitive.  If you can't think to click on the amount of BTC to add in your balance, I don't think it's the fault of your app.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:59:17
If you're feeling nostalgic you can buy some [retro/pop culture trading cards]( from my store Boxsome.

Everyone is really overreacting about this.  Downvote all you want but I'd take a Bitcoin-less iOS over Android any day, and if Bitcoin gets more popular Apple won't ignore it, they're not dumb.
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:57:12
Why yes, yes they should.

This is awesome, I'm new to Bitcoin (unfortunately I've read about since the beginning but never bought in) and I've been trying to figure out how to get my Mother in on it.

Great work! I'm a musician and I recently put a bitcoin QR code on my tip jar. Probably won't get much use, but why not?

Very nice!

Amazon is a great way to get MacBooks without tax, so I'd say Gyft would be great.

Thanks for reaching out.  I'm most excited about bitcoin as a self-employed person.  I use Paypal now but it's not ideal, and I can't wait until bitcoin is more widely accepted and I can get more clients to use it.
And here's a tip, be sure to come back and tell us your thoughts on the hearing!

What about running Electrum in an Ubuntu Parallels installation and password protecting everything? Also keeping in mind that the Mac had Little Snitch installed to report any suspicious network activity. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:39:57
Commenting so I can easily find this again.

I wish I could get my clients to pay me in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:09:52
I'm trying to figure this same thing out.  I guess it depends on how good our 1Password master passwords are.

I added a QR code to [my tip jar](

It said he had 12 and the attacker bought another 10 instantly. I read it.

I just got my first .01 BTC and as soon as it clears on Coinbase I'm getting more.

I use WooCommerce and the Bitcoin extension. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:25:26
I run a small e-commerce store on WordPress and use an extension to my e-commerce plugin to enable Bitcoin payments, and basically it just outputs a QR code at checkout that people have to scan, and their order won't be confirmed until they pay to that wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:06:16
Very cool! Any tips on printing your own wrapping paper?
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:56:02
Thanks! Yeah it's a small coffee can so the 'TIPS' is on one side and the QR code is on another.

Why buy coffee when you can buy [cheap, vintage trading card packs]( with bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:54:17
I want to, but then again I know they'd all just lose their paper wallets.

I wish I could buy food with it around here, but Gyft will have to do for now.

Coinbase has invoicing/requesting money features.  You could also try using an [escrow service](

Yesterday I used a .025 BTC paper wallet as my white elephant gift for a trade and it went over really well. First time I had talked to my family about Bitcoin. Giving out a couple more tomorrow!
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:36:54
I'm a freelancer and I do almost all of my client payments with Paypal, and I've always not cared about the fees much because I can just write them off, but using bitcoin and having almost zero fees would be very nice.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:46:23
If you ever get the need to buy some retro pop culture trading cards, check out [Boxsome](

Protip: you can probably make more coin from tippers on Reddit than from using faucets.

I gave about $30 worth of bitcoin to a couple different people this Christmas who had both never heard of it, and just talking about it briefly got them very interested. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:56:00
No thanks. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:00:53
Why were you storing 12 BTC in a Coinbase wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:43:04
Granted, I live in Indiana so this is probably pointless, but if nothing else it will be a good conversation starter to get people introduced to bitcoin.

Whoa, thanks for the [Help!](
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:17:08
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't that .0001 fee stay the same regardless of how much you want to send?  If so, it's an incredible savings over Paypal, which is around 3%.

This is great! I run a pretty niche webshop that accepts bitcoin. It's called [Boxsome]( and I sell 80s/90s trading card packs. Things like Ninja Turtles, Ghostbusters, Jurassic Park, etc. I send out cool free goodies with orders and I have a lot of fun with it.

@_date: 2013-11-22 23:58:48
These all seem so spammy, and the 'website description reviews' hardly worked for me when I tried.  Just people trying to boost their SEO for pennies.
I wish there was a more legit survey site that gave bitcoin.

I wish Coinbase's WooCommerce (WordPress ecommerce system) plugin was as nice as BitPay's. CB's has no fees for the first million dollars, but is ugly as sin.

Sorry to hijack this thread, but you guys might be able to help.  I am in the process of trying to set my cousin up with a bitcoin wallet to accept donations for her son's heart transplant.  What would be the best way to go about that?  They have so much on their plate right now, I'd hate to call and try to explain bitcoin in five minutes.  I'd rather just set up a paper wallet (with proof/verification of their story) and try to promote it on Reddit, and then send it to them.  Any thoughts?  The little guy is still in the hospital (just had the transplant yesterday) and I thought we could get a photo of him holding a QR code.  They have hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenses piling up right now.

I agree.  I can't imagine *not* mentioning Coinbase to anyone I try and introduce to bitcoin.  Now that I got all verified on the site and can buy coin instantly, it's so awesome.
