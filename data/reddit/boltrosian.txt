The easiest way to buy a modest sum is IMHO to use a bitcoin ATM if you happen to live near one.
How to know if you live near one?
Check here:
Usually you pay a little more in exchange rate than buying from Coinbase/Circle etc, but you won't have to wait for bank linking and all that.

Miners complaining about their (lack of) profitability is quite commonplace. Usually with concerns about how to make ends meet after the halvening. Justified or not, if profits are at least fairly limited, bribes wouldn't have to be significant relative to the market cap, they'd just have to be significant relative to the net profit a mining operation is making, for that mining operation to have to consider the bribe seriously.

Fair enough, my labelling of China as fascism is entirely based on what the country looks like today, not the "where it comes from".
Although, interestingly, I think China does share the Mussolini nostalgia for a greater past, and they both came out of a long time of being humiliated by those who they previously always saw as inferior. Mussolini yearned for the glory days of Rome, and wanted to put an end to the days when Italy was the laughing stock being slapped around by the other states. China had gone through the humiliation of the 19th century and early 20th century, after previously for basically 2000 years having been able to look down on the inferior foreign lands, and was (and is) trying to restore the respect and status as the world's foremost power (or at least on par with the greatest).

Yeah, this always amaze me.
Funny how many lazy bitcoinistas tend to sound almost exactly like mainstream media or the general public when it comes to altcoins.
"I don't know much about it, but most of what I've read it's all scams"
"Mostly just criminals doing bad stuff"
"Basically a modern day tulip mania"
"Why can't they just use the normal money? I don’t see the point of all this alledged ‘innovation’. Money is fine as it is”
“They are not backed by anything significant”
"Failed experiment. Or, if it hasn't failed yet, it will very soon"
"Won't ever go anywhere until banks and regulators gets behind it"
If people want to find out why they are having a hard time getting bitcoin to spread, why the general public look funny at you when you start talking of bitcoin, a good way is to consider your own feelings about altcoins, because surprisingly often they seem to match very closely.

Nationalist, militarist and with an economy dominated by huge mega corporations who are very closely intertwined with the political class. Close identification of race (Han) with nation, use of race and nation to justify the primacy of the leadership. Central planning, antiliberalism, antidemocracy, anti degenerate "Western" ideal in order to foster a healthy societal machine for the benefit of the societal machine itself (rather than the individuals).
The main difference with "classic" fascism is the lower emphasis on person cult of the mythical leader, although Mao and Deng had that element in th past (back when it was more communist than fascist), and Xi is ramping that up. But in general, the mythology of the Strong Leader has been replaced in China with the mythology of the Strong Party.
I chose the word "fascist" very deliberately because I can't think of a better description for present day China. Calling China "communist" is ridiculous today (communism is horrific, but a completely different kind of horrific than the Chinese fascism of present).

Not trying to be a smart ass, but that is exactly the trend what has been happening all over the world for the last 50 years or so. Walmart anyone? They did rather well until a new kid on the block were able to sell even cheaper (albeit also more conveniently) - Amazon.
Shopping malls have been a thing for quite some time. The small local grocery store has been on the retreat for a long time, as a consequence.
I say this as one of the few remaining stalwarts of small local grocery and specialist stores, regardless of them being expensive, but I look around and clearly the ability to save a few percent matters to most folks.

Still a 51% attack. One that would undoubtedly lead to the unchanged original bitcoin chain to persist, mined by the minority.
And if the cartel didn't also have the economic majority and be supported by the general ecosystem, then their cartelcoin would soon be less valuable than the unaltered chain. At which point mining would also flood away from cartelcoin, unless someone would be willing to burn lots of money for no apparent benefit.

Exactly. Which is why a hybrid card is necessary in order to do some payments out in the real world. Depositing a coin now and then into your hybrid card so you can pay your rent or buy groceries isn't giving up your BTC to a bank, it is living off BTC in the real world here and now, as best as that real world here and now permits.

Back in the fine old days of the Weimar Republic, when "printing money" actually meant actually printing actual money, it actually worked. As far as kick starting inflation goes. Bet one day those bankers will regret their cash-less society before monetary control was handed over to the banks which have no interest (no pun intended) in benefiting anyone but their own shareholders. So all those "printed" QE "money" never actually enters the economy, they just prop up the balance sheets of banks. And real estate moguls. This is what happens when the people cede power to their government, which then cedes it further to the banks and other major corporations.

In over a hundred years, yes. That's when the subsidy ends. Are you sure that the right priority right now is to cause the system to collapse just to design around problems that will happen a hundred years from now?
That is as if Switzerland started spending all their money on building walls against sea level rise, because a hundred years from now, sea levels might have risen and hey, Switzerland will be coastal at that point.

So you did buy it so you could (if need be) sell it.
Also, according to what seems to be your logic, that merchant adoption is bad because it enables people to sell instead of baghold, any altcoin with much lower merchant adoption would be a better choice than bitcoin. And yet you presumably chose bitcoin as a more reliable store of value. Why is that? My answer would be that the ability to potentially sell (spend) an asset is what makes it valuable. The more *potential* future buyers, the more reliable. Merchant adoption *is* buyers (regardless if they directly convert it to fiat after buying it from you).

Now you are moving the goal posts. What you said was:


You didn't talk about the competition (banks), you talked about the demand. I don't think there is ground to assume that demand for transactions grows exponentially. At least not between humans. Perhaps if you assume that Internet of Things will take over, but then all bets are off.
"20 years of Moore's law" would equate to 20 years of a doubling every 18 months iirc. That's 13.3 doublings, or approx 10000 times more than today. The current VISA system has a capacity of  (according to  50,000 tx/s, but only utilizes approx 5000 tx/s. Bitcoins capacity from what is frequently said is on the scale of 5 tx/s. Thus, in "20 years of Moore's law" scaling would bring bitcoin to on par with the current VISA system's capacity, and 10 times more than the current VISA utilization. 
Of course, there is also other networks than VISA working in parallell, so if bitcoin would want to take it all over, there would be an increased requirement, and more importantly, all the scaling does not strictly follow Moore's law, as disk size, network capacity etc grows at different speeds.
However, the bottom line is that if you have exponential growth in bitcoin capacity, and merely linear growth in the amount of transactions people want to make, then bitcoin *will* catch up eventually, and something on the magnitude of "a few decades" seems about right.
Again, it is more complex, but your blanket statement was that not even with 20 years of Moore's law will it be possible for bitcoin to catch up with global transaction demand, and IMHO that's plainly untrue.
Whether centralized banks can also grow is irrelevant because the number of worldwide transactions is a function of economic activity, not the capacity of banking systems. Instead I'd say banking system capacity is a function of the amount of demand driven by economic activity.

I'd say Facebook overtook Myspace due to interface and usability, and thus managed to reach far beyond Myspace's loyal follower circles. At the time of Facebook's arrival, Myspace was a mess that required newcomers to commit to a heck of a lot more for it to be useful than just signing up for Facebook and find a few friends, then let the network effect take it's effect over the next year or two. Myspace could have scaled to trillions of users for all it wanted, since it required too much of it's users, and it was too steep of a learning curve and too niched, the playing field was wide open for a competitor to bring social media to the masses. As it turned out, Facebook did (fortunately it also scaled to said masses).
