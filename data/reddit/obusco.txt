Well in this particular case (like a MtGox in France), I think that no... nothing that you can do :( Just conplain for a cyber-hack. But then it will takes like forever to get on court... 
For exemple, a friend get 10+ stab with a knife. She's allright, but this case, that we can fairly assume is a high crime, it took 6 years to get on court ! So just imagine two second what could happens if you ask to the 1000 people who work on the cyberpolice for the all 70 millions people... Any scammers would die by old age before it would be judged... 
Fortunatelly we do not own any scammer in france (we export them in other country :p Brain-wash :p), but If we would, that surely the best country... :(

I'm hodling since the first day. I start my massive buy at 100, so If I look over this year... I'm still in good shape. 
Why anyone would sell ? The only seller ar those who bought at 1 000 expected to gain quick and fast money. 
I don't care if they sell. 
Bitcoin is not here to be a quick profit. It's here to be independant from bank. And those who see the real utility of Bitcoin won't sell :)
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:18:46
Yes, but don't have the ecosystem behind that. Bitcoin start to have it.
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:43:22
You don't seem to believe in it ? 
Well, I propose you the better way for you to have the proof. Go on cexio. with like 10Bitcoin. 
Just buy, and see. With 10BTC you have a enough weight to make move the price. Then when all bot followed you. Quick sell. And take your profit. And redo it again and again over the day.
By doing this in free-time only. I do with 0.20 BTC about 0.01/0.02 BTC per day (but just in 4-5 hours so I do not maximize my profit). 
So that is 10%, except if my math are wrong...

Same here. Since 3 months now. And I saw that when I took my iPhone it was the first on technology and ergonomy, but now they are step behind android... In fact i'm glad they banned bitcoin or I would be stuck with the last iphone "so new, so original, so first"...

That's nothing for them as they are under THEIR regulations. That affect the buyer only (he may not as the right to do it). And in Europe, every country legalise it.

Yes but everyone has now 6$ to trade for things. It's a passport for that guy to make himself ask what is bitcoin, and with the want to make that guy, may be ask 0.01 BTC to another friend that have the same amont given by the donation program, for like ten hours of house-cleaning. And other time this guy ask now give 0.01BTC for 2 hours of another work. 
The fact is, that we are too connected with fiat. Because we can't do anything else yet. When you try to calculate how many people use bitcoin, it's so low that using your bitcoin is hard.

The problem was not really the lack of licence. 
In france, to open this kind of business you need a banking license. But french authorities does not put so much (well not at all in fact) effort to track french exchange. 
In this case, they was criminal history on the founder. He surely was followed by the Police that lead to the existance of this business, and by lack of proof for any criminal related stuff with his new business, they took the only real stuff they found : lack of license. 
But it's the same as arrest someone for "Drug possession" when you want to stop someone for a crime per exemple. If you don't have proof (or enough) you take what you can. 
Police in France does not watch french exchange, they did not have any official intern statement to do so(yet).

I think your calculation must be wrong... Could you explain it ? Well, thinking that with my btc I could be billionaire is fine but still :0
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:09:57
On that, i'm not agree. I'm here because at a day someone offer me to have as few BTC as 6$ (at these time), and now 3 years later. I'm still here. I made research at a time when it's value was like nothing. Well, I do not own the 6$ of these time, but I made BTC my current most-used account. 
So I think that 6$, it's something. For some people in this world it's a all salary... 
6$ is enought worth that make a way to distribute to many people. And if in this all people, just 10% will really look into it, well then it still that, and the other people, well won't ask for the bitcoin first... Because it would be to painfull to go learn how to have dollars from 0.01 BTC

Short : No. 
Long :
* This work on RSA. Bitcoin use ECDSA then sha256 then sha256 again, then another algorithm to make it readable (as B58). 
* (In the RSA case : Work only in a Man-in-the-middle attack, as you need to know the cipher text. Could work only with large fund-mafias.
In this case, it's easier to run, steal your phone while you are connected over your app (like blockchain) and run with it.
* Patchable (and patched) 
* It work bit par bit, need to get a new ciphered text to the automatic decryption app. On a payment-equivalent, you will need to make many and many payment... If you can do that, well, you should send directly payment on your address rather that listening.
Edit : (correcting EDSA to ECDSA)
* Additionnaly, the attack work with a code in the cipher text wich make reproduce bit per bit the decryption. Not usable in bitcoin context.
* You need approx. 1 hours to do that... Not applicable at all. You need to do and redo the process many many time to gain 1 bit over several seconds (1.50~). ECDSA is 512 bits, if this worked the same (assumption that the proof of work is extended to all encrypting algorithm and that none on the above point is actual) so you need 12.8 minute to get the private ECDSA private key. But as we work with a 256 ( 6min) then again 256bits (6min). It would take 24 minute to get it...
And even if it works, you need a single core processeur to do it. And if you have a SSD, no noize, no party.
Sooooo, as short said : No :)

In Euro : Kraken. 
When ? Well, I would suggest you to wait some days. Just 10 days to see  and read what happen. Then if nothing more awfull came. Then get in. If nothing else than good news happens on these next weeks. I would suggest you to take your total cash and divise it by like 10 little amount that you will buy each 1 or 2 days. 
Then you won't put all your money once, and you will be more free to move quickly if needed ( because I expect that if no bad news happen,price will start a new bubble)

And a major french supermarket is planning to add it too before end of the year. 
Bitfinex and other french start-up was on the same table with the government in order to not do stupid stuff with bitcoin. 
Now, we have a legal regulation around it (For exemple, we do not pay any taxes or whatsoever when we gain more bitcoin from bitcoin, we are taxed over our euro gains from bitcoin transaction, so while we do not convert it into euro, we do not have anything to pay :) )

There is no way this comment help a developer. Because if a guy REALLY NEED it, he won't be able to understand anything about code. So he won't put anything... 
And if he can code, he won't need that.

Really, bad idea. Tor's server are not mean to be thrustworthy. Anyone can read the data you've sent (except tunnels) and they could get your id.. In the picture case. They've the all inputs you've made (email) done by post xhr in the chat. 
Use other service that tor, this is more suitable to see banned site, replay from other country and stuff like that. Tor should be use in anonymity without bringing your real life (wealth) inside

I read about a stuff like than on coindesk or on the internet. A guy who want to get 10% of all coin generated (in average of course) but buying a FREAKING lot of hardware. He was at a good number, but I read 3 years ago a Guy doing the same in Iceland, he made a bunker. 
I think that these 37% are the're huge hardware dedicated on mining ... :/
@_date: 2014-03-28 09:52:47
Well, I can source that by day-trading, I earn more than in longer term =3
In fact I won enough to cut my "loses" from 1000$ to 500$. 
So just be sure that day-trader are winning, I talk with them a lot. It's like 5 to 10% per day ! (especially on no-fees place)

For me, after many calculations, buying hardware is not profitable. 
What I choose to do is buying GHS, because I can re-sell them instantally (without fee, I use this to trade too). 
So when I have time, I trade, when I sleep, I mine. 
But this way is risky as GHS lose his value very quickly over time, you have to sell at the good time.
I do not advice that way, but well, it's still a way to do mining :)

Just check on the blockchain, there was big movement long before the mail. 
If I was a guy with a good bitcoin investment, what will I do ? 
First : Create a highly secure place for keeping them
Second : Running a lot of nodes looking for what's going on on the blockchain, where is going the money, wich country etc... 
Then at the moment of the tweet, other people in the world knew that a lot of bitcoin moved from an exchange or a website. (Regular people do not do that much operation with bitcoin, you can know if wallet is used by pro or not, or at least supposed so). 
With a little insight information (IRC or other), he could easily know. 
That's just one way, there is far more others. But just to share that with a disclaused blockchain, running complex automated analysis on it is not complicated and very usefull. Add information that you have (like Blockchain giving the name of some of bitcoins adress) and voila ! 
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:29:17

"The main developers think unnecessary hard forks are bad and want to include many different upgrades when they do one."
Wouldn't that make any hard fork even more complex, because in thoses multiples differents upgrades, there would be multiples differents reasons for one to disagree on one of them, having a consensus hard to find and therefore making this SegWit process like a trivial thing ? 
On peer-reviewed software developement, in order to get your pull request accepted, you tend to make very atomic changes that you push, so you don't have a BIG changes being rejected for a reason, but instead, you have a lot of little changes accepted, and a little change rejected, that you can individually fix and repush. 
Plus, it allow bug tracking/debugging/reviewing to be way easier :)
(I do understand the resonning behing "hard forks are bad", not sure of the solution adopted when one is needed, as it seems to me that it will make it even worse if it's a hell of big chuck of modification).
