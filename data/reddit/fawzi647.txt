Don’t believe this ratings. It’s probably rigged to put down Bitcoin. Remember the 2007 recession when all the so called awesome rating agencies cheated the people.
They were also charged during recession for pump and dump—&gt; 
Yeah no thanks to your BS Weiss Ratings

Some of them don’t have official statements but have been suspending accounts. Members have been complaining on the Bitcoin CA page.

@_date: 2017-12-27 04:55:27
Don’t know about them but I am working on a review for another exchange shortly. Stay tuned 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:07:00
Oh shit? Is this exchange owned by Indian IT department? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:15:35
Great it worked! Yeah the volume is lower but as you know the volume in India is comparatively lower than international exchanges.

Try it again. They are up and running as per my knowledge. Are you stuck on the KYC part? Cause that’s a little tricky 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:17:06
I hope they are Segwit enabled but you may want to confirm with the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:00:28
Nice! What do you think of Expedia accepting BTCs?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:46:36
