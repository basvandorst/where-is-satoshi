The hard limit exists to enforce the max block size that will be considered valid.  If we don't want to accept 100MB blocks, the limit has to be lower.  If we have a limit at 100MB, we're forced to accept them or stop running a full node.

Fees should be a free market. That's why it's a good idea to give the network some time to run at 1MB capacity so that we can see the fee market develop. It's an important step for long term viability.

What happens is that their friends who recommended them to use bitcoin don't recommend those wallets which haven't implemented smart fees.  They recommend the wallets who have a smart fee system so the user can choose the expected confirmation time vs fee tradeoff.  And there we have it, honeybadger has evolved.

I do agree that there is going to be fallout from this change (eg. merchants being double spent), but I think you're misunderstanding his motives.


I think what he's referring to is that replace-by-fee enables users to re-transmit their transaction with a higher fee attached.  So, rather than just waiting forever with their money locked up, they can do something about it.


It's more likely referring to fixing the "crash landing" hypothesis so that we can operate with full blocks and a functioning fee market.  This would eliminate a source of pressure to raise the block size.


Now and for the forseeable future, it probably just means "users who are not creating pointless spam".
As an aside, the white paper doesn't say transactions are irreversible, it says that get exponentially harder to reverse with each confirmation.  Zero-confirmation transactions aren't even in the blockchain yet.
@_date: 2015-06-01 03:54:49
ChangeTip is already off-chain.
If the blockchain only secures the largest transactions (since they experience the smallest relative fees) then this is a good thing since the blockchain is securing maximum economic value while preserving decentralisation.

Actually no one knows wheter 50kb blocks would mean pizza/coffee is affordable via the blockchain. Maybe 95% of transactions are mixer spam that would dissapear as soon as the fee raised a few cents. I sure would like to find out. That's why I would like to stick with 1MB blocks until we see the fee market come into existance and we get an idea for the elasticity of transaction demand. Afterall, a fee market is a vital component to long term viability of the network. Why delay this important step in bitcoin's development?

@_date: 2015-06-01 03:50:24
Do you not see your contradiction?  Fees will only be $100 if the network is so popular that blocks fill up with transactions paying $100, therefore $100 fees implies a popular network.  If it's not popular, the equilibrium price will drop until blocks are full.  This is how a market works.
You are simultaneously arguing that it will be both incredibly popular and also no one will want to use it, which is a contradiction.
@_date: 2015-06-08 07:59:08
If it weren't controversial, no one would be thinking about preserving the integrity of the system. Does your wallet fully validate the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-06-01 09:08:37
If blocks were full of transactions with 50 cent fees, I don't think there would be much or any resistance from core devs for increasing the blocksize (eg. doubling it).  We're a *long* way from that situation, which is why people want to wait and let it play out.

It's as pure a market as you can get.  There's no opportunity for speculation.  We're talking about real-time demand for space in the next block.  Block space is not some asset you can buy and then sell later for a profit.
edit: re your point:


That's actually what happens when blocks are *not* full.  Block space is in oversupply so cost of blockspace gets as close to zero as the cheapest miners are willing to accept.  If block space is in undersupply, a profit-seeking miner will award it to the highest bidders who must compete amongst eachother, sending the fee its true value as determined by the users.
@_date: 2015-06-14 09:16:34
What if miners eventually start earning more fees from the sidechains than they do from the main chain (could happen due to a higher transaction rate), so they give up on merge mining with the bitcoin chain and just pool mine on the sidechain.  And then the miners of the side chain could decide to soft fork to remove the 2-way peg mechanism.  Then the chain would exist on its own and could overtake bitcoin's market cap.

@_date: 2015-06-01 04:14:57
There's no reason that the network should be unusable under an ongoing spam attack.  It should only push fees slightly higher.  Nodes and wallets just need a little work to deal with this new environment with full blocks and a fee market.  I welcome this spam service, but I think it should consolidate its UTXOs when it finishes, so that there's no long term impact.

@_date: 2015-06-12 13:15:25
No, they don't :) From the 1MB network's perspective, coins sent to extension block addresses would just go to an anyone-can-spend output (but spending of these outputs is actually restricted by the soft fork). Then those coins can circulate within the 20MB blocks which only need to be processed by the extension block network. When they want to move coins back to the 1MB network, there would be a transaction inside the 1MB block which spends them from the extension block address. So it almost acts like a sidechain in a way. At least that's my understanding..
@_date: 2015-06-12 21:58:15
What about having hard fork limit as well which grows automatically over time, based on some reasonably optimistic projections about future bandwidth, storage, and processing.  You could base it on numbers that Gavin came up with whereby we should still have people capable of running a full nodes on a high-end home PC with good broadband.  This would be a safety net against a small group of miners who decide to push everyone else out.
We at least need *some* guarantees on how big blocks *could* get.

No they can't.  Doing so would fork their node and makes a chain fork occur.  The blockchain only works when all nodes follow the same set of consensus rules.
@_date: 2015-06-02 01:58:27
I think you're mixing two different meanings of "consensus".  One is a technical term that refers to the code which decides whether a chain is valid.  In this sense, we currently have 100% consensus since everyone is running the same consensus rules.
The other type of consensus is about agreement between people on the future direction of bitcoin.  There is a whole spectrum of opinions and we are far from 100% consensus.  I doubt there could ever be 100% consensus in this area.
So given those two definitions, I'm not quite sure how to interpret what you are saying.

Fees *are* needed.  It's been an assumption all along that the network will need to support miners through fees.
Please elaborate on how fees will be "required".  Any such scenario will need to involve full blocks.  If we're not willing to accept the pain now and evolve, why would it be any easier in the future when there is even more at stake?  Your proposal is simply to kick the can further, and keep the training wheels on (training wheels being an oversupply of block space with miners supported via a large block subsidy).
@_date: 2015-06-16 00:10:12
Luck is whether you find more or less blocks than you would expect to find given your hash rate.  Consistently bad luck could be a sign of a block withholding attack, where an attacker mines for the pool but withholds any shares that would give the pool a block.
There are some propsals to fix this attack by introducing a secret blinding factor, so that the miner doesn't know the full difficulty of the shares they find.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:29:52
For bitcoin to work, everyone needs to follow the *exact* same set of consensus rules, otherwise there can be a chain split.  So "stupidly oversized" needs to be quantified as a number that everyone agrees on.  Right now that's 1MB, and that's what this whole debate is about, what to change that number to.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:35:12
Any profit seeking miner will include transactions based on the highest fee paid, so an attacker has an unbounded cost if they want to prevent others transactions from confirming.  This makes it a different kind of attack than the unlimited block size attack where a miner can make arbitrarily large blocks for free which forces their peers to lose time validating them, which gives them an advantage for finding the next block.
@_date: 2015-06-14 09:06:40

Jeff, why do you discard the top 20% and bottom 20% and then take the minimum of the remaining values?  Isn't it redundant to have removed the top 20%?
Also it's not clear whether the block size adjustment occurs after each distinct 12,000 block period, or is it a rolling calculation which could change at every block?

This is where a hybrid proof-of-stake system could help down the track.  Imagine if the "length" of a chain (currently calculated as "total work") was redefined to also factor in the number of coin days destroyed, so an empty chain would struggle to outpace a chain full of transactions, even if it was produced with majority hash power.  And to prevent the attacker from including transactions in their chain, we could have a mechanism for transactions to specify a parent block that they consider valid, so that they can only be confirmed into a child block of that chain.  So then you go on IRC, or whatever, and discuss which chain you believe to be legit, then enter its parent block hash into your wallet and now your transactions cannot prove stake on the attacker's chain.

Difficulty isn't actually a concept that exists within the blockchain.  It's an abstraction built on top for human readability.  The blockchain works on a "target" value.  The target value is a 256-bit number that a miner's hash needs to be lower than.  So, rather than trying to have a specific number of leading zero bits, you're trying to hash lower than the target.
Difficulty is just the maximum target value divided by the current target value.  Hence, the max target value is referred to as "difficulty 1".

I think the message should not necessarily be telling people why they need or would benefit from bitcoin, because right now the technology is difficult to understand, difficult to use, and there's a lot of hacks and scams which creates risks for novice users.  In its current state, I don't think bitcoin is really ready for prime time.
Instead, the message should be to just make people aware of what's going on, and get them curious about it and dispel any sense of negativity:
- bitcoin is breakthrough technology, a profound an exciting idea like electricity or the internet
- bitcoin is growing fast, and is not going away.  expect to see it becoming more and more mainstream over the coming years.
- there is so much activity and buzz in the bitcoin space, many new startups, lots of investment, lots of legitimate legal businesses and interesting projects in development

The only thing going across the USB wire is going to be unsigned transactions, signed transactions, and whatever other commands are required for managing the device.

If you're fine with not validating the blockchain, then you don't have an appreciation of what makes bitcoin so great.  The whole point of cryptocurrency is that it's trustless because the ledger is validated by all participants.

@_date: 2014-08-06 20:23:33
A double spend is when you replace one legit ledger with an alternative legit ledger.  By "legit" I mean all the signatures were valid, and all the funds spent were existing and unspent prior to the transaction.  In one ledger they spend their funds to user A in transaction X, but in the other ledger they never include transaction X, and instead include transaction Y where they spend the very same funds to user B.
The reason it requires 51% hash power is so that you can make your "alternative" ledger (forked chain) have more proof-of-work than the main ledger (main chain).  When you release your alternate ledger, if it has more proof-of-work then people will switch to it and accept it as the "true" version of history.

You're suggesting there could be an exploit in the firmware.  Any software can have vulnerabilities, including any other bitcoin wallet.  The difference is that bitcoin wallets running on your computer can be compromised through no fault of their own, if there is malware on your system.  That's the idea with separating the wallet out to a simple isolated hardware device, because it's far easy to protect that way.
The trezor firmware is open source, so you can audit it.

Oh don't get me started on that stupid actor-rationality argument that tries to downplay a 51% attack.
Bitcoin is supposed to be about anti-fragility, not about faith that people "choose" not to attack it.
Luckily the ATM thing is not related to bitcoin itself, it's a business offering around it.  We can use regular techniques to understand how the owners might act.  It's definitely not unprecedented for someone operating a business to try to extract maximum cash out of their customer base at the expense of their reputation (hmm, western union maybe?).

I doubt they would even have their own reserve of physical oil barrels, as that would have high cost of overheads.  So likely you just own a virtual asset that's backed by a paper oil contract held by BitReserve which is backed by some other third party who supposedly has access to oil.

I don't get it.  What's the benefit?  Someone can't steal your encrypted wallet?  Your BIP38 passphrase should be strong enough to be uncrackable, so it shouldn't matter who has it.
The private keys would still exist in memory for doing the signing, so if your phone was hacked, your wallet would be compromised.  This is why you really need a dedicated signing device for proper security.

I don't think that one little dip on the chart signals a trend reversal.

If they spent their pledged input, they would essentially be "un-pledging" the money.  Whatever system is responsible for combining the pledges would have to check the inputs and exclude them if they've been spent.  I don't think you can get around this unless you put your pledge money into a multisig escrow, but then that could carry a risk of you not getting it back.

That doesn't make any sense.  Just because someone doesn't abuse their 50% power once doesn't mean that it won't get abused some other time in the future.  We already KNOW what is possible with 50% hash rate.  It's always been known, and it's bad.  If GHash doesn't abuse it, it doesn't change the fact that we lose decentralisation.  This problem won't go away until we can get far more decentralisation into the mining infrastructure.

Storing cash outside the banking system is useful as a backup plan for when you get locked out of your banking (it happens).  In that sense it's like keeping cash under your mattress, but it's more secure as it can be protected by a strong passphrase, and it's also easier to move around (you can send it over the internet which you can't do with cash).
Think of it like an open source banking alternative that never goes down.
If you're also concerned about the pitfalls of fiat currency (eg. inflation, capital controls, etc) then Bitcoin is great protection as it has a fixed supply and can never be shut down or censored.

Bitcoin-Qt is the gold standard, but it will require a lot of bandwidth and storage (maybe around 20GB) and will take a long time to sync up.  It'll also use a little bit of CPU because it verifies every block / transaction.
Otherwise you could use an SPV wallet like Electrum, which is also pretty safe.
Just make sure that you back up your wallet before you send any coins to it, and ensure you don't have any malware on your computer.  If you're really security paranoid, then you want to generate an offline wallet.
Ease into it slowly and makes sure you understand what you're doing every step of the way.  Good luck.

Exchanges don't set the price.  They allow buyers to meet sellers and agree on a price.  If you want to peg an altcoin to USD, you need to provide unlimited USD buy support at $1.  Ie, if someone dumps 1 million of these coins on the market, you need to have $1million to give to them to maintain the peg, otherwise the price will fall.  Likewise, if someone has $1 million and wants to buy your crypto, you better have 1 million USDcoins ready to give to them, or the price will rocket.
Supply and demand, bro.  Currency pegs don't work without capital controls.  Capital controls != free movement of money.

What does your concern relate to?  Mining difficulty, or the market price of bitcoin?  I can't think of anything else that it should affect.
Mining difficulty doesn't suffer a shock because it's very easy for miners to forecast future expected returns using the simple reward schedule (in fact, far easier than using a more complex formula).
Market price.. well, who cares if it goes to the moon? :)  But really, since the supply is known, its a fair playing field for all and future supply can be priced in already.

Definitely agree with you there.  Bitcoin is something that is more likely to thrive in peaceful and prosperous times.  It doesn't necessarily belong in a prepper kit.
IMO its still an ideal store of wealth though, because you could be able to restore access to your money months or years later when things were better.  Imagine if you had millions of dollars in gold bars instead.  That'd be a big risk to carry with you, and a big risk to leave behind in case it gets found.

Yeah but you're missing the point.  Someone can't just change the rules of bitcoin and make the old rules cease to exist.  Changing the rules splits the currencies in two, and both continue to exist.  No one can stop you transacting in whatever digital currency you want to use.  And as you say "people just do whatever they want" - that is the freedom of it.  There is no one policy that people are forced to use.  Bitcoin, or any fork thereof, is a choice.

Miner's can't force a fork on users.  So for example, they can't arbitrarily decide to award themselves more than the permitted block reward (ie. more than the current 25 bitcoins per block), even if they all agreed to do this.  Full nodes validate every block and won't accept it if it doesn't meet the rules, so essentially the miners would just dissapear from the main chain and go off on their own fork which we could either choose to join or not.
The thing that makes miners have more weight on the rules is that they are the ones who add security to the blockchain, so if they abandon us for a new fork, then we can either follow them and benefit from the security, or continue on the old rules but with a less secure chain.
If they decide to start 51% attacking the old chain, then we have problems.
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:49:38
Technically it's bad practice.  Firstly the key is known to both you, the ATM, and whatever other cameras / devices have been set up by attackers.  A private key should be generated by you and known only to you.
Secondly, to redeem the BTC, you have to import the private key into a wallet, which is bad practice because there are many "gotchas" that people can get tripped up on if they don't know what they're doing.  Eg, if you leave the imported address in your main wallet, you could end up using it as a receiving address (or your wallet might choose it for change for some reason), then you end up with coins sitting on a potentially-compromised address.
Also, what happens if you're walking home with the paper in your pocket, and the coins get spent?  Was that you, or the ATM, or some attacker?  No one can prove who spent it, but too bad, your coins are gone.
Importing / exporting of private keys should not be a feature that ever sees the light of day with mainstream users.

Yeah, you should work under the assumption that you will owe capital gains tax on your BTC profits upon selling them, subject to the same CGT laws that other investments are.  That is, until your tax authority advises otherwise.

In theory you should be able to use some lightweight SPV node which will give you decentralized verification but without needing to store the blockchain.  Still would use a lot of bandwidth though.
You could also just integrate a couple of different APIs (blockr, blockchain.info, chain.com) and make sure they're all confirming the tx.

That's not how markets work.  No one needs to know that the coins are burned in order for it to affect the market price.  The market price is set by supply and demand.  Burning coins forever removes them from the supply side of the equation.
Gold that's on the bottom of the ocean does indeed affect the market, as do other factors that affect supply and demand.  Except one day the gold may be retrieved, and re-enter the above-ground supply.

The problem is that you're seeing bitcoin as being democratic, but it is actually anarchistic.  Think about it like the internet.  We don't use IP because a majority of people voted it in.  We use it because the masses have converged on it, but there is nothing from stopping anyone from running different protocols, and with time new protocols may be adopted, but it will happen in a chaotic bottom-up fashion, not by some kind of majority vote.
The network effect doesn't rule anyone.  Again, bitcoin is voluntary!  If, one day, satoshi shows up at your house and points a gun at you and forces you to use bitcoin, you might be able to complain.
edit: 


Bitcoin itself actually disproves this idea.  Many people thought that bootstrapping a currency from nothing should be impossible.  By the traditional definition of money, its a paradox.  If no one accepts it for payment, how can it have value?  If it doesn't have value, how can anyone accept it for payment?  The network effect is so strong behind existing currencies already, so by your theory we should be forced to stick with them.  And yet, Bitcoin has proven that if people believe in an idea strongly enough, they can bootstrap the network effect from nothing.  You are NOT forced to follow the crowd.  Think big and invent big ideas!

It's worked out by looking at the amount of time it took to produce the last 2016 blocks.  So, the targeted timespan is 14 days (1209600 seconds), and lets say the actual time it took to make those blocks was only 10 days (864000 seconds), then the difficulty will be adjusted by 1209600 / 864000 = 40% increase.

It's a poisson distribution.  If you repeatedly roll a dice, you would expect to get a 6 every 6 rolls on average, but it's definitely not going to be within +/- 1 roll every time.  Some times you'll get it first try, and rarer occasions it will take you 30 rolls.  The same math applies to bitcoin mining because each hash has an independent chance of finding a block.  There is no "progress" in finding a block, it's just all luck-based.
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:31:40
You conspiracy theory does sound plausible.  They made the announcement about p2pool to get publicity and push their ponzi forward, and then they backpedal since it would disprove their hash rate.
It's also a bit suspicious how they changed their share structure early on.  Initially the shares were supposed to be finite and 50% of the dividends reinvested to mining hardware, so the underlying hash rate per share was meant to constantly increase.  That's another thing that attracts users but is not ponzi-friendly.  They then canned that idea and I believe each share now just represents a fixed hash rate that doesn't grow.

Multisig wallets with online co-signers are designed to have a good security + convenience tradeoff.  Having to sign everything offline is not convenient.  When you want to pay the bill at a cafe for your coffee, do you want to say "brb, i've gotta go home to my basement to get this transaction signed".
Keep your long term savings in offline cold storage, and then use a hot wallet for every day stuff.  Using multisig on your hot wallet improves security.  Of course, the wallet developer could put in a backdoor to steal your key.  So pick a wallet / signing service that you trust.  If the wallet provider is honest, then it can be much more secure against attackers than a single signature wallet, whilst maintaining the same convenience.  Look into greenaddress.it or bitgo.

@_date: 2014-05-25 14:53:05
That sounds good, but I would also use bitcoin-qt's encryption feature to set a strong passphrase on the wallet before you back it up.  It will make it more secure for when you eventually retrieve it and need to load it up.
Also, since you will be generating the wallet without a blockchain, when you eventually go to spend from it, keep in mind that you may need to run a -rescan to pick up your transactions (I ran into that problem before - I freaked out when my balance was 0, but -rescan fixed it).
Also, since you're paranoid, you should also sign the file containing your addresses, otherwise it could be tampered with to fool you into paying the wrong address.

Um no.  If you want to operate a business you have to pay taxes in fiat.  If you want to earn income, you have to pay taxes in fiat.  Anyway, if you're saying that paper money isn't mandated by governments, then you're saying fiat money isn't fiat, which makes bitcoin even *less* like fiat, and that contradicts your original point where you claimed that bitcoin is fiat.
Bitcoin is a new type of money.  There's fiat (aka "paper money"), specie-backed (ie. gold, silver), and cryptocurrency.

That's how bitcoin already works.  If a majority of hashing power decides that they want to censor a particular transaction, they can do it.  Doesn't matter if a minority miner mines it, the majority can orphan their block.
So much for "absolutely not true".
@_date: 2014-10-16 20:26:44
There are some fallacies here




Both of these statements assume there is a relationship between peoples desire for a functioning network (adequate security, blocks every 10 mins) vs how much fees they voluntarily pay.  I see no evidence of this and the game theory doesn't seem to check out.  People will always pay the least amount of fees they can to get confirmed within their target timeframe.
If someone feels uncertain about the blockchain's security, do you think they will voluntarily increase their fee from 0.1mbtc to 1mbtc, just to donate to miners?  Some might, but in general, no one will.  It's the Tragedy of the Commons.  If others are funding the security, we can freeload.  If the security falls to pieces due to tragedy of the commons, people will just stop using the blockchain to transact.
The only reason fees will ever go up is due to competition for block space.  If blockspace were unlimited, I predict that Bitcoin would become worthless once the block subsidys ended, because no one would step up to fund its security.

I agree with you that there is a ridiculous idea out there that we can be comfortable with a party having 51% because it's "in their interest" to not attack the network.  The people who have these opinions are obviously not software engineers (or good ones at least).

Isn't money laundering when you make illegal funds appear as legitimate earnings?  The idea being that you can store it in your bank account and the tax department thinks you earnt it through some legitimate legal income stream.
In this case, the stolen CC money is moved into bitcoin, and your bitcoin is 100% traceable to the crime, so it's still illegal money that you have to hide.  To then launder the bitcoins would involve somehow tumbling them to hide them crime and then making them appear as legit income somehow (maybe faking that you did some online job and got paid).

The transaction would begin with both parties posting collateral to an address with a special script(s) involving conditions that require A to know the secret key, or signatures from both parties.  This can be done atomically.  Both parties are now incentivised to go through with the agreed contract since they both have collateral at risk.  Using a key derived from the file contents would be a convenient way for allowing the funds to be released &amp; payment made once the file transfer is complete.  It incentivises the host to send the file, and the client to publish receipt of the file via the unlock transaction.
I'm not saying this is how it should be done, but my main point is that you can use atomic transactions, non-standard scripts and collatoral to structure it so that both parties will lose if either is dishonest.  Then you could even build in a reputation system where less collatoral can be required if there is a higher reputation involved.

Yeah but the miners, and the community, will trust the core development team if they put out a new release and decide to implement sidechains.  And I trust the core dev team based on the fact that they all seem to be independent thinkers and there is often a lot of debate and disagreement on things before they are implemented.  I just worry that this guy is trying to social engineer his way into influencing bitcoin.  I mean, he's already admitted to having closed-door meetings with key bitcoin developers (he mentioned it in his Lets Talk Bitcoin episode), and he invites developers over to his mansion and makes them feel all special.  He's calling it Bitcoin 2.0.  So if this is such a significant thing, why isn't it way more public?  It just doesn't seem to fit with the bitcoin philosophy of being open and intellectual.  Instead, it may be closed and circle-jerky.  What if this influenced core devs enough to have them make decisions based more on personal relationships and groupthink?

No, because just "agreeing" doesn't actually conjure dollars into existence.  Someone needs to supply a dollar for every coin that's being sold, and someone needs to supply a coin for every dollar coming in, and both supply and demand have to be exactly equal or someone isn't getting their order filled.
What would happen is that you'd have way more dumping from miners than you'd have investors throwing dollars in, so you would need your own stash of dollars to support the peg, and the miners would drain that stash until the whole thing collapses.

Looks like a completely normal datapoint for that chart.  Given its linear scale, but exponential growth in hashrate, the volatility is always going to be most visually noticeable at the top.
Not sure why people downvoted me for telling the truth either.  Network hash rate is not known, it can only be estimated, and the figure will be more inaccurate if you're only averaging over a small number of blocks.  That chart doesn't actually say how many blocks its averaging over.

It doesn't change the data, but puts it into perspective so you can better understand it.  I thought the pattern was pretty self explanatory, but in case it's not:  The transaction volume peaks when the price peaks.  After each peak, it actually drops off.  There is a bow shape formed between all the peaks.  As you can see, transaction volume declined for months after the April 2013 bubble, and recovered in the buildup to the Nov 2013 peak.  As with the price, so too does the transaction volume reach a higher floor after each peak.  The fact that it has merely been flat since last peak, and isn't actually falling, is quite a good sign.  Overall, the exponential curve is intact.

You are, because you're saying that there's no reason for anyone to spend bitcoin.  If no one spends it, then the none of the purchasing power is ever realised, which is obviously not happening since we see large volume on exchanges and also purchases happening with merchants via bitpay, coinbase etc, so people are utilising the purchasing power of their bitcoins every day, whether to buy another currency or for goods/services.
Right now the ones spending their bitcoins will be the large holders.  They are early adopters who have realised massive gains already (100+ multiple) on their original investment, and their investment portfolio is likely to be massively overweight in bitcoin.  They have far more to lose in terms of opportunity cost, than to gain.  They're rich on paper, through a highly volatile and risky asset, so it's time to actually start cashing in to improve their standard of living.  These are the people who will be taking space flights and buying lamborghinis, apartments, and booking holidays with bitcoin.  It's these people that the merchants should be targeting.
New investors are not likely to be looking to spend, since the reason they bought in is likely to profit so they will be holding out to see more gains before they go spending.
And then there's enthusiasts who just want to spend bitcoin because they believe in it and want to help kickstart the economy.

Not all commercial bank reserves come from loans from the fed.  It's more like: fed purchases government bonds, governments use the cash to pay for government projects and staff, and the people who receive those government payments deposit them into banks.  The banks then owe the money to the depositors rather than to the central bank directly.
The fed doesn't even care how big its balance sheet gets because it has no concept of solvency/insolvency.  They will expand their balance sheet (buy bonds, mortgages, and even stocks) whenever they want to print money, and will contract their balance sheet (eg. selling assets they hold) if they need to tighten the money supply.
I agree that the system as it is now is beyond repair, the money will never get paid back in real terms, it has to either end in default or hyperinflation.

Miners continue mining for transaction fees.  They earn all the fees paid by transactions in blocks they mine.
Since the block subsidy halves every 4 years, eventually reaching 0 in 2140, over time the ratio of fees to subsidy is going to increase, so its going to be a gradual transition to the fees-only model.  Hopefully at that point in the future we have very high transaction volumes, so that earnings from fees are significant.

Because all you did was point on the disavantages of spending bitcoin.  This isn't a reason for people to abandon the **10 billion dollars of purchasing power** sitting in their bitcoin wallets.  If you sit on it until you die, you never realised any value out of it.
Imagine a guy who has $3k USD in his bank account and works a shitty job, but has $5M USD worth of bitcoins because he was an early adopter.  It makes no logical sense for him to continue to live a poor life, purchasing groceries with only USD, because he's scared that buying with bitcoins could working out cheaper if he waited 20 minutes.
And cashing out to fiat via exchange is the same as spending with a merchant except that you have to interface with the banking system which a lot of people would be afraid to do (if they see large deposits from bitcoin exchanges they could freeze your account and investigate you for fraud).

No, all fiat currencies are being devalued.  Just look at which direction prices are going in.  Are you paying more now for your food, rent, electricity, fuel, clothing, education, medical costs?  These prices go UP over time.  That's not because these basic needs are becoming more valuable, it's because the money is becoming less valuable.


It's used for 2 things.  One is to fund governments who are actually bankrupt (ie. they run a deficit year after year), such as the US government.  This perpetuates wastefulness and promotes big government and a drain on the private sector.  Secondly, printing is used for "can-kicking", ie. solving a debt problem with more debt.  Essentially the global fiat banking system is a giant ponzi which wants to collapse, but the central banks are keeping it alive by pumping more and more printed cash into the system.  The money doesn't benefit ordinary people - it goes to the banks and finds its way mostly into asset bubbles (eg. stock market, bonds).  It only hurts the poor who have to suffer this bloated corrupt financial system.

The other security concern is that both keys exist on the same system temporarily when using the default (non-advanced) method for creating a BitGo wallet.
Another security issue is that the strength of the user's keys depends on the strength of their password.  BitGo stores an encrypted copy of the user's keys, protected by their password.  If someone compromises BitGo, they can try to crack your keys.  With greenaddress.it, they never store your keys - you store your own keys, and back it up with the seed.

Gox "buying" their own goxcoins on their own exchange does not magically create BTC out of thin air.  Nothing changes in terms of their BTC and cash reserves.  All that happens if they bought 1000 goxcoins is that they would owe 1000 less goxcoins to their customers and owe $100K more goxbux to their customers, all the while the underlying reserves never change.  If they opened up trading again and the price of goxcoins goes to $900, and they sell them, again this just means that they owe 1000 more goxcoins to their customers, and $900K less goxbux.  It still leaves them in the situation of having to acquire those 1000 extra BTC that they owe their customers, which then cost $900 to buy real ones from another exchange.

Since there would be 2 blockchains, there would instantly be twice the coins and hence natural market forces would cause the purchasing power of the coins to drop accordingly.  So I'd say that the new coin would get 40% market cap of the pre-forked bitcoin, and the other 60% would remain in the original bitcoin market cap.  This doesn't factor in any drops that could be caused by a shaking of confidence in crypto.

It makes it a far more complex calculation though, because if you're averaging over the last 2016 blocks, you you have a different difficulty for each of those blocks.  So rather than a simply doing `newtarget = oldtarget * actualTimespam / targetTimespan`, you have to instead factor in the separate difficulty of every previous block, add up all the expected hashes, then estimate a new target based on all those different numbers.  It could be done, but it's more complex then the current system which is very easy to understand.

Not really.  There's not much use in trying to plan a solution for a "perceived" problem that may exist decades into the future.  Sure it's good to brainstorm about it, but I don't think we can just come up with fix now since we don't know the parameters of the problem which really depends on how mining evolves, transaction volume, fees paid, and price of BTC.
If security is not sufficient when funded by fees alone, perhaps we could move to a crowdsourced model for funding mining.  Or maybe, as Gavin has speculated, mining chips might be everywhere, eg. inside your heater that warms your house.  In that case the network would be very secure since mining is no longer just a for-profit venture, which makes the revenues less significant of an issue.

Nope.  Verifying transactions is easy and is done instantly by all bitcoin nodes.  It's the proof-of-work that takes a long time, and the whole point is that it's slow.  The blockchain purposefully makes it *extremely* difficulty to add a new block to the end of the blockchain.  Faster mining just means the proof-of-work requirement goes up to maintain the average 10 minute block interval.

No way.  Coinbase won't charge for instant conf.  Greenaddress.it wants to charge because that's their only business model.  Once this BIP is in place, there will be many providers offering it, and I really doubt people like Coinbase will charge.  Coinbase has a vested interest in smooth PoS transactions.  It would cost them nothing to provide instant confirmations and they'd attract more people to their platform by offering it free.
edit: also, Circle will most certainly do it for free, as their whole strategy is around everything being 100% free, and easy (read: instant confirmations).... thats if Circle ever decides to materialise out of their vapour cloud.

They definitely do some of their buying off exchanges.  Barry Silbert confirmed this when he said they had hundreds of relationships with private sellers.

I think you underestimate cryptography.
Take a look at this scheme for atomic cross-chain trading, and if you understand it you might be able to see how something like that could be used to achieve a paid download.  
The trick would be to require the downloader to derive a key from the downloaded content which can be used to unlock some collateral that was posted before the download, which simultaneously proves they received the file.
I'm not sure how it works, but that's just an example of how powerful cryptographic schemes can be.

You're exactly the type of person I warned against in my post.  Firstly, you're using the word "FUD".  Secondly, you're trying to appeal to "actor rationality" to justify centralising bitcoin.


What a weak way to dismiss something with no counter argument.


This is a tired, tired argument that has been repeated way too many times here.  As I said, if you don't want a decentralised currency, do us a favour and go use something else.


Again, no substance to your argument.  If GHash was mining 100% of blocks and all other pools had a 100% orphan rate, it's not hard to connect the dots and see that everyone would leave the other pools.  We already have more than enough evidence to show that most miners value their earnings above anything else, and care very little about the issues of centralisation.

It's not that simple.  There is not a 1:1 relationship between fees and volume.  eg. halving the fee could mean 5x volume.  There is also a non-linear relationship between volume and operating costs.  eg. double the volume won't cost them double the overheads.  Overheads are fixed things like staff costs, electricity, legal &amp; regulatory costs, and these aren't tied directly to volume.

I would find it hard to imagine how the Labor Theory (as you described it, since i'm not familiar with it) would apply to bitcoins, because the cost of producing a coin has very little to do with its utility value.  For example, even though we are minting coins at 74 Petahash now, it doesn't mean those coins are any superior to ones minted on a single CPU back when bitcoin first launched.  They are both worth the same price.  And just because the hash rate is high now, doesn't mean it won't drop in the future and undermine the security of all coins and make them worthless.  In fact for the coins to keep their value, the network hashrate needs to stay indefinitely high enough to be secure and allow them to securely circulate for eternity.  So it seems to me that if we want to tie the value of the coins to mining, it would be tied to the ongoing mining efforts over time.  But everyone already knows that mining investment follows the price, it doesn't lead it, so I think that in itself proves that mining expenditure doesn't really "back" bitcoin.  People just care that the network is secure.
@_date: 2014-11-30 12:32:07

Only after infinite time.  If you're measuring the probability over a finite period of time, it's &lt;100%.  For example, if I have 60% of hash power, and I'm racing the other 40%, there is a small chance that I will end up with a smaller chain after 1 hour.  As more time passes, the probability of me winning becomes higher and higher.  Thus, it tends towards 100% over time.
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:15:44
That's not within any forseeable future, by a very large margin.  Not even remotely close.  If we can get to 2^160 hashing power, then bitcoin addresses are already useless, so we would have moved to new algorithms a long time before approaching 2^256.  And anyway, current understanding says that 2^256 is not within the realms of physical possibility due to energy and physical size limitations.

@_date: 2014-06-09 12:51:36


That's not a solution.  You can't form a trustless consensus this way.  Not everyone sees which peer a block came from, and not everyone sees it come from the same peer, and some people were never online to see it broadcast at all.  A pool can broadcast a block through any number of IP addresses.  Any kind of validation rules involving relaying would cause chain splits.  It would be trivial to split the network into a large number of forks.  Longest PoW chain is our ONLY way to form trustless distributed consensus.


They have to play by the existing rules, but the existing rules allow them to do a full network DoS.  They can mine empty blocks and orphan all other pools blocks, bringing all transactions to a halt.  There is no stopping this without a hardfork.

That's right, all that matter is you're below the target.  If you're trying to find hashes with 10 leading zero's, half of them will have 11 leading zeros, 25% will have 12 leading zeros, etc etc, so occasionally you will get block hashes that are actually way more difficult than required.

Think of it less in terms of a protocol, more as a global distributed ledger.  The ledger itself, the "blockchain", is the revolutionary part of bitcoin.  The ledger *only* counts bitcoins.  The currency is not so much the first app as it is the native and lowest level app.  Any future apps built on top will involve moving bitcoins around but with higher level abstractions.
eg. due to the fact that bitcoin transactions can be linked in a chain, we can "colour" some specific coins and use them to represent ownership of some other asset.  They can be transferred via the blockchain like any bitcoins, but apps could recognise them as the stocks of a company.

Nope, everyone chooses their own rules in Bitcoin.  No one can force you to change your consensus rules without forcibly upgrading your software.  If there's a split in consensus, there's a fork in the blockchain and multiple currencies are formed.  Supply/demand will determine the value of each fork, and acceptance by merchants will determine the usefulness of each fork.
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:01:36
Anyone can hard fork the code.  The only added benefit of a powerful miner doing it is that they would add a good amount of security to the new chain.  Everyone one else will reject the blocks as invalid, no matter how much proof-of-work is on them.  Users would have to voluntarily patch and upgrade their wallets and nodes (including all the major economic players too, such as bitpay, coinbase, blockchain, etc) before the new chain would be widely accepted.
But I don't believe that security alone would be enough of a reason to make everyone switch to a hardfork that they didn't consider fair.  There would need to be much more compelling reasons to actually make users move to a new chain.  A far more compelling reason to move would be if all the economic players actually moved.  Eg. if you couldn't pay a bitpay invoice with Bitcoin because they'd moved to a new hardfork and were rejecting classic bitcoin blocks.

I'm glad that she gets this.  Some people see it as 2 separate systems, a payment network and a currency, and they wonder why the currency is necessary.  She has answered it perfectly.  If the ledger entries are representing something like dollars, there needs to be settlement done outside of the blockchain.  Since we just transfer bitcoins via the blockchain, there is no settlement required, as you are really sending the actual bitcoins.

No that's incorrect.
Mining is the process of creating blocks.  Blocks are required in order to confirm transactions.  Without confirmations, bitcoin would not function.
Difficulty increases are not baked into the protocol, it only happens when the network hashrate grows, in order to rate-limit blocks to once per ten minutes.  In other words, blocks will always come approximately every ten minute on average, and difficulty will be adjust up *or* down in order to keep the production of blocks to that target rate.

You have to understand that they'd be buying goxcoins, not bitcoins.  Their reserves won't change simply by shuffling around entries in their own database.  If they wanted to turn BTC into cash, they can do it with their reserves now regardless of who it's owed to in their DB.

The fee goes to the miners BTW, not to the wallet creator.  So there is no incentive for the wallet to charge you any more than the bare minimum required to make your TX confirm.  Generally the fee is set to whatever is reasonable to get your transaction confirmed in the next block.  Bitcoin Wallet on Android is now doing a 0.00001 fee, so you could switch to that if you think 0.0001 is too high.  If your wallet is paying more than 0.0001, then it's likely you need to upgrade as it might be out of date.
Note that some transactions will need a higher fee than others if they are large in size (not large in BTC amount, but large in data size, which depends on how many smaller payments are rolled up into that transaction).

Bitcoin balances are tracked via a distributed database (called the "blockchain").  In order to mint new coins you'd need to add a record to this database, essentially saying that "Address XYZ has some bitcoins".  The reason why you can't just do this on a whim is that:
- Only valid records will be accepted by other bitcoin nodes (must comply with the rules)
- It is extremely hard to add a new record to the DB unless you have enormous computational power, or are extremely lucky
Those 2 things combined mean that coins are minted at a steady rate of approximately 25 per 10 minutes, and they go to whoever 'mines' them using their computing power.
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:19:44
I believe you're right.
Actually bitcoin is not deflationary from a monetary perspective, it is stable (although during the mining phase there is inflation which slowly decreases in its rate over time).
A fixed supply of money works perfectly in my opinion, as then the price of money is a perfect supply/demand market, rather than having artificial supply or demand forces.  It seems the most fair that way.
Sure, the value of bitcoin might appreciate over time as the economy grows.  That's because there are more goods and services being chased by the same supply of money, so a coin's value needs to increase to make this possible.  That's a normal price discovery mechanism and the increase demand incentivises savers to spend their money into the economy.

P2SH is an address format that does a generic "pay to script hash".
The thing with multisig is that it requires large scripts.  They contain multiple public keys, and multiple signatures.  Like your example, 3-of-5, requires a huge script.  So if you were to try to encode that into an address, it would be massive - way too big for users to copy and paste.  Also, by having such a large output script, it means users who pay you have to pay bigger transaction fees just to send money to you, because you're a multisig address.
So P2SH is a solution to this problem, where you make a HASH of the script (could be 2-of-2, 2-of-3, 3-of-5, whatever, or might be a different script altogether that isn't multisig).  You make a P2SH address that encodes this hash.  Then people who spend to the address make a simple short script of this form:
OP_HASH160 [20-byte-script-hash] OP_EQUAL
At this point, no one knows what the script is.  It could be a huge m-of-n script for all we know.
Then, when the owner of the address goes to spend it, they have to specify:
- the full script that matches the hash
- the required signatures to satisfy the script
So now the cost of the large script becomes the burden of the person who owns the address, and we have a nice short address format that allows wallets to pay to any arbitrarily complex script just by implementing P2SH support.

But an economically rational miner should pack as many transactions into their block to make maximum returns, no matter how small the fee (accounting for propagation costs). For a miner to forgo fees in hope of a cartel to force users to pay more isnt rational because it only takes a small fraction to defect from the cartel to make it barely effective.
I think demand for transaction would dry up if there 51% attacks were a regular thing.
Edit: further more, in the cartel scenario, defecting miners woukd earn more money, driving the cartel miners out of business. So it's just not sustainable to have unlimited block space

Yes, difficulty can both rise and fall.  Every 2016 blocks, the difficulty is retargeted based on the time it took to generate the last 2016 blocks.  The calculation is fairly strait forward to understand:  difficulty := difficulty * (expected_time / actual_time).  The "expected_time" would be 2016 * 10 minutes.  So if the actual time was half of that, then difficulty would double.  There is, however, a 4x limit on adjustments.  If difficulty suddenly fell by 90%, then we'd be waiting ~90 mins per block until next retarget, then we would have a 4x drop, and then one more slow period until we finally readjusted to a 10 minute block interval.

That's a strange assertion.  Just because a block hash is stored in binary doesn't mean it's wrong to write it in hexadecimal.

The coinbase transaction in the genesis block is never added to the index of unspent transaction outputs.  It could be a bug, or could be deliberate, but it means that those 50 BTC can never be spent.

Nope, mining is the process of creating new blocks in the blockchain.  Blocks are essential for transactions to take place.  If there are no blocks, no money can circulate.  The blocks come every 10 minutes forever.  Miners don't only get paid the block subsidy, they also get the sum of all fees for all transactions in their block.  Mining difficulty can adjust both up and down to accommodate new hardware coming or leaving the network.
At the pace that mining hardware is evolving, it becomes obsolete within 6 months.  So we know that all of today's mining hardware will be in the garbage heap long before all the coins are mined (over 100 years into the future).
@_date: 2014-04-27 01:53:01
One thing that I didn't hear in the interview - side chains have no block reward at all right?  So there is no incentive to mine them at all unless you have a stake in keeping that sidechain secure?
@_date: 2014-05-29 11:44:49


That's not actually done by the network.  It's up to your wallet to validate the checksum on an address and refuse to send if it's incorrect.  The bitcoin network itself is not aware of addresses.  Transactions themselves only contain the public key hashes with no checksums.
@_date: 2014-06-03 09:30:39
Yep it's an algorithm based on timestamps of the last 2016 blocks.  There's not just one node that does it.  Every full node does full validation of the blockchain, so if a block doesn't follow the correct difficulty rules then the node will reject it.
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:24:56
Deliberate collision of addresses would be a concern long before accidental collisions.  Even on my shitty laptop, I can generate ~130K addresses per second.  If I had a decent graphics card, I could do 30 million per second.  With a farm of GPUs, someone could do billions per second.  For comparison, today there are only 3 million unique bitcoin addresses that hold a balance.  The possible space of bitcoin addresses is 2^160 which makes a collision way beyond *any* possible brute force attack.  In fact, some people have done the maths/physics analysis and say that it would require more energy than our sun has to even just *count* to 2^128 on *any* computer: see   So needless to say, if a brute force attack of any scale is not going to find a collision, then collisions from everyday users is not something to be concerned about.
Bitcoin addresses are [Base58Check](
The '1' at the start of the address is due to the version byte which identifies the network that the address corresponds to.  See 
Longer/shorter base58 doesn't change the security, it's just a side effect of base 58 not aligning perfectly with the underlying byte lengths.  All addresses contain a 160-bit pubkey hash.

When I refer to the longest chain, I mean the one with the most proof-of-work.  That does't have a lot to do with what we're talking about anyway.
Look, someone with 10% hash rate can outpace the other 90% over 100 confirmations - it's just a very very low probability event.  You can't say someone has 100% probability of producing a winning chain unless you are basing it on them having a &gt;50% hash rate for an infinite period of time.  Thus, what I said in my first post, is right.  It *tends* toward 100% over time.

No way!  You don't understand multisig.  The oracle cannot steal any of your coins.  If it's a 2-of-3 address, one of your signatures needs to be on all transactions.   YOU create your own transactions, and the oracle either signs them or doesn't.  The worst it can do is a DoS attack, to which you can recover from with your recovery key.  People won't host their own oracles.  The security comes from the fact that it's a third party, so there's 2 independent parties that would need to be hacked.
Re exchanges, you don't want your exchange to be able to move your coins unilaterally.  That's how you get goxed.  Exchanges can have highly liquid off-blockchain trading (as they do now) and then settle trades between users periodically via the blockchain, with the signature of the oracle who essentially an arbitrator for the user and exchange.

You were already given answers in your other thread.
It doesn't matter if USB is secure.  Cryptography exists for the purpose of communicating over insecure mediums.  The whole internet is insecure, vulnerable to eaves dropping, and MITM attacks, that is why we build cryptographic protocols on top of insecure mediums to ensure the end-to-end communication is safe regardless of what's happening in the middle.
In the case of Trezor, the security comes from the fact that the keys are generated on the device itself, and never leave the device.  It's just like doing all your cold storage on an offline linux machine, except it's all done via a simple hardware device.
@_date: 2014-08-12 01:33:46
It still implies there is a supply/demand equilibrium at this price.  Otherwise there would be people who want bulk coins who are missing out.  Game theory / arbitrage would say that they would turn to an exchange and bid the price up rather than just "missing out" and letting the privileged whales get access to the cheap coins.
@_date: 2014-07-11 21:04:11
I wouldn't take any chances when it comes to securing money.  Insiders at drop box would have access to your files, so its not like setting a strong password is going to stop all attacks, and you never know when there is going to be a dropbox vulnerability, or you accidentally get phished.  Or, you get malware and they keylog your dropbox password.
It's not clear what the passphrase was for.  Maybe he had an encrypted wallet file on there too, or maybe it was a brainwallet passphrase.  Either way, the whole thing sounds like really terrible "security".
@_date: 2014-01-14 07:12:49
How much do you understand about computers and security?  Fundamentally, bitcoin security is quite simple.. you generate a private key randomly, and all you need to do is prevent someone else from gaining access to that key.  In order words, if you store it on a hard disk, and they hack your comp and read the key, then you're screwed.  That's why you want to encrypt it before storing.  But even then, if your comp is compromised, they could run a keylogger to catch your passphrase.  This is why the most secure storage method is OFFLINE, away from the internet.  If you do your key generation offline and keep it offline, then there's no chance of anyone stealing your keys unless they physically steal it in real life.  But make sure you don't lose your keys either.. so keep backups..

Your coins would remain safe in the blockchain, but you would need to get *some* kind of connection to the bitcoin network in order to transact.
The same thing would apply to your bank account - no online banking, no ATMs working.

The network won't grind to a standstill, it will just be expensive to use.  Even if it cost $5 per transaction, users could still use it when the cost is justified (eg. moving a large amount from cold storage into an exchange).  If it cost $5 per tx then miners would be earning ~40 BTC per block just from fees, which would actually be good to see because we'd be transitioning to a regime where fees are the dominant form of miner income, which could be necessary for long term viability of the network.

There is no specific number.  It just matters how many confirmations someone is going to wait before accepting the payment.  eg. if a merchant gives you icecream after zero confirmations, then it's easy to double spend.  If an online store takes your payment but doesn't ship the item until 100 blocks later, then you've got no chance.

We already have an easy way to add a cost to transactions via the min fees that miners accept, and the min fees that nodes want to relay transactions.  So since we can have a monetary cost, there is no need to add cost via CPU work.  Requiring proof-of-work would degrade user experience, and it's an uneven playing field for different wallets / devices due to the different hashing power available to them.

a) you're signing transactions on an online device, hence not cold storage
b) you're running JS code from a website.. which could change any time that cryowallet (or some hackers) decide to change it
c) why should anyone trust this random site anyway?
Proper cold storage means using signed apps from trusted developers, generating keys offline and keeping them offline, and signing transactions offline.  The signed transaction can then be transferred via sneakernet to an online device for transmission to the bitcoin network.

Exactly.  Milk is a de-centralised product.  Anyone can breed their own cows and "mine" their own milk.  However, the milk industry as a whole was facing a decades-long trend of reduced per-capita milk consumption.  By coming together as an industry to boost the image of milk as a product, they were able to turn this trend around.  It was a famously successful marketing campaign.
The point of the article (if you read it) is that collectively the industry could work to build a PR campaign to strengthen the brand of bitcoin itself, which would benefit the entire industry.

No, the xpubkeys are dedicated chains shared only between the two parties.  Eg. Bob has a unique xpub chain from Alice, and Alice has a unique xpub from bob.  This doesn't reveal anything about any of their other addresses to eachother.  It just provides a way for them to send money to eachother without any address re-use.


That's bad for privacy as now you have multiple payments being unnecessarily associated together.  The point of using a fresh address each time is to avoid this.

When someone sends you money, the blockchain records it as spent to your public key (well, no one knows it's "your" public key, it's just \*a\* public key).  This happens without any involvement from your computer.  When you wish to spend, you need to use your private key to sign a transaction (which can be done offline), and then only after that point do you need the internet in order to send the signed transaction out to the rest of the world.

That's not cold storage.  As soon as your key goes into memory on your phone (an online device), the wallet is hot from then on.
There is no difference between storing a key encrypted on your phone vs storing it encrypted elsewhere - if you're using encryption correctly then the ciphertext is of no use to an attacker.  What an attacker needs is the ciphertext + encryption key which in this case they can obtain by compromising your phone.
It's only a cold wallet if you sign transactions OFFLINE.

At the moment the miner can put the transactions in any ordering, although that might change with the IBLT work that is coming up, where a canonical ordering would be required.
The bottleneck for mining is how fast you can do repeated SHA256 calculations.  There are no tricks to get around that.  If you want to hash block headers with different merkle roots then you need to separately run SHA256 on each header.

This doesn't sound right to me. I definitely do more transactions now than I did in the past, because there are more places available to spend it, more charities to donate to, more people to tip. As the network grows, I expect to transact even more, because there still many expenses that I do in fiat. So maybe the number of transactions per user is something like log(n) which would make the total transaction figure already contain the n*log (n) term

Just general logic.  2-of-3 Multisig + HD wallets provides the level of security and convenience that people are used to with banking.  Eg. you could have a physical recovery key stored securely at home, everyday key on your phone, and then an online oracle service who cosigns.  Then you can safely do transactions on your phone, the oracle will co-sign them if they meet your configuration (eg. daily withdrawal limits, pin number entry, lockouts if too many pin attempts, no withdrawals to scam addresses).  If your phone is hacked/stolen your funds are secure, and if the oracle missbehaves you can always use your offline recovery key to have full control over the funds.  No ongoing backups needed either since it's all deterministic :)
There is a new startup who is trying to do this kind of thing: 
Exchanges will also start using multisig.  To move funds requires 2-of-3 between customer, exchange, and an arbtrator/oracle.  the exchange periodically settles trades by moving the funds between customers with the permission of the oracle after proving the trades took place.  the customer + arbitrator can combine to withdrawl the funds in the event of exchange failure.  exchange can never run away with the funds.

They're not really weakening bitcoin, as they are kind of a separate system on top.  They don't have as good a security model as bitcoin, in that the cost of attacking coloured coins doesn't grow with the market value of the coloured coins, whereas with bitcoin it does due to the natural competition of mining.
I think the people relying on the ledger will need to help fund security.  This could be by funding mining (regardless of profit), or by helping to promote adoption of the currency.

I tried the update.  It's still dog slow.  You've got great wallet technology, but I think you need to rewrite your app from scratch, as it seems to just be unresponsive by design.  As a general principle, no user actions should be held up by remote requests.  The UI response should give instant confirmation the user of their action, and any UI elements that require remote data should indicate that they are fetching it.
Currently it takes about half a second for any of my taps to be acknowledged.  I'm not sure if that's because it's hung up on remote requests, or if it's just that inefficient on the client side, but it's way too long a delay.  And then the whole app will intermittently lock up for a split second while it's refreshing the wallet balance.
In one of Mike Hearn's talks he said that Google Maps went from having flat user growth to having exponential user growth, just by making it run slightly faster.  So don't underestimate the importance of this!

Funny how they write that headline, and don't include any quote from him that says that.  Rickards is a smart guy.. surely he didn't suggest bitcoin should be tied to gold.  He should be smart enough to understand that this would change bitcoin into an IOU ledger and remove its ability to do trustless transfers of value.  A bitcoin transfer would mean nothing until you get the physical gold in your hands, so the ledger would be totally out of sync with the real world thus rendering pointless.  Might as well send someone an email to say "hey i'll give you some gold next time I see you", it'd be about as effective as doing a blockchain IOU transfer.

Interesting question.  With gold I think the difference is that 95+% of gold holders do not take physical possession of their gold.  I'm not sure what the figures are, but I think it's a very very low amount of COMEX contracts that request physical delivery.  Most people leave it "allocated" in a warehouse where it can be lent a re-lent hundreds of times.  There is something like 100x more paper gold that physical gold.
I don't think we can have that situation with BTC because:
a) there will be products coming along that make it very easy and secure for users to take posession of their own coins
b) there is already technology being developed to allow exchanges to prove that they have 100% reserve backing.  users won't store BTC with an exchange/bank that can't do this.
c) things are moving towards everything being multi-sig anyway, so your coins can never move without your signature, even if someone else is "holding" them for you.
For these reasons I don't think we'll ever see the ridiculous amount of unbacked paper assets that exist in the gold market.

and then encrypt your offline storage with a passphrase and a good cipher like AES.  Then even if they steal your offline device, they still can't decrypt it.  In the event that this happens, you notice it's stolen and use your backups to send the bitcoins to a new secure address.

The default rule is to mine on whichever one you saw first if they're both the same length.  Probability says that it becomes exponentially unlikely that both chains with repeatedly get blocks at the exact same moment to sustain a prolonged fork, so there will be a tendency for conflicting chains to resolve themselves quickly.  The "longest chain" rule means that everyone has an economic incentive to want to mine on the chain they believe will win, so that they're not wasting their hash power for no reward.
Yeah, re-orgs 1 block deep happen regularly under the normal course of mining, but re-orging 3 or more blocks is only likely to happen under an attack scenario.

Counterparty runs on top of bitcoin so it is secured by all the bitcoin hash power.  Ethereum is its own blockchain and will need its own miners for security, so the security is likely to be way less, at least initially.  Ethereum is probably going to be way more flexible since the scripting language is validated on a blockchain level, whereas the bitcoin blockchain knows nothing about counterparty and doesn't care about CP transactions being valid.  I havn't read much about how counterparty works, but presumably there's some kind of validation rules running on top, recorded into the blockchain in the form of bitcoin transactions.

If we want full blocks then we can't stop accepting transactions into the mempool when it reaches the max block size.  Blocks don't come every 10 mins exactly, so you need larger mempools to buffer them so that blocks can be full (even if there are two in quick succession).  Also it doesn't make sense that transaction fees should suddenly become cheaper the moment a block is mined.
We should just let each node decide how big it wants its mempool to be, and once it's full then can kick out transactions based on fee.

The analysis is more complicated than that.  Even if we assume there's a 6 second delay, and then everyone else hears about your block at the same time, there's still not a 10% chance of being orphaned, because the pool who found the block will switch immediately to mining the next block.
For example, if a pool has 10% of the network hash rate, as soon as it finds a block we have 90% of the network mining orphans and 10% mining the next block.  This gives a 9% chance of the block being orphaned.  Now lets imagine the pool has 30% hash rate.  Now the block only has a 7% chance of being orphaned.
The bigger the pool, the less competing hash rate there is to orphan their blocks.  This creates an advantage for large pools, which encourages centralization.  The smaller you make the block interval, the more it favours large central pools.  We should be careful about anything that gives centralized advantages.

The difference with the idea I'm suggesting is that you receive a dedicated xpub from each friend.

The system I was proposing involves generating a new xpub every time you pair with a new friend.

If fees are $100, the network will be insanely popular.  That's ~800 BTC fees per block.  That would be a wild success if we reach that point before we even pass the 2nd halving.
Remember that the assumption of high fees is equivilent to assuming that the network is popular.
The idea is not to stay on 1MB forever, but to move once we reach a stable regime where blocks are full, a market for block space exists, and off-chain solutions are being used.  Then it will be time to increase the block size (maybe double it) which may boost miner revenues even more, and make settlement via the blockchain cheaper which enables more use cases.

Good explanation.  I think it's more of a bubble than a ponzi.  In fact, it's a huge huge bubble, but it's just hard to see because the underlying asset suffers from exponential decay.  I don't mean bubble in the way that people call Bitcoin a bubble, because the difference is that fundamental analysis *does* apply very easily to GHS.
When the chart goes sideways, it means the price is increasing exponentially above the intrinsic value of the shares.  Like all bubbles, this *will* have to pop.

No, the bitcoin blockchain and ethereum don't do general-purpose computing.  I can't make myself a website or mail server and host it in those blockchains.  I can't boot up a cluster of virtual machines running in the blockchain.  If you're going to compare Maidsafe to something, compare it to Amazon EC2 / S3, except that instead of paying amazon for the infrastructure, you're paying your peers from all around the world.  Visit  and read about their services, if you don't know what cloud computing is.  You'll see it has nothing to do with blockchains.
As for ethereum vs counterparty, just look at Bitcoin's scripting language and you'll see it's highly limited and no where near Turing-complete like Ethereums.  And bitcoin like it this way.  Counterparty adds an additional layer on *top* of the blockchain to provide more complex contracts.  Ethereum has complex contracts built natively into the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-11-22 10:54:04


That's not correct.  The transaction can be reversed by building a  longer chain on top of the previous block (the one prior to your confirmation).  Assuming the attacker has less than 50% of the network hash rate, each confirmation makes it exponentially less likely that they can successfully produce a longer chain and orphan your block.

It states a change to the behaviour of nodes on the network.  That's outside of blockchain consensus.  Nodes are free to do anything they want in this regard - what's important is that they have the same consensus rules for validating the blockchain itself.  IBLTs and other network optimisations are just techniques for communicating blocks more efficiently.  The IBLTs themselves are outside of the blockchain and therefore can't be used for consensus.


The word "consensus" has a more specific and technical meaning when used in the context of bitcoin.  Consensus is what allows us to agree, trustlessly, on the validity of a chain.

Since the timestamp is within the block itself, the change is consensus-compatible.

I think it's based on the attacker trying forever to overtake the main chain.  Because when you input 49% hash power and 6 confirms, it says 95.94% success rate.  If it was a strait race to 6 blocks, you should lose more than 50% of the time, but if you kept trying forever to get in front, perhaps that's how you get a 95% chance of being 1 block ahead at *some* point?

We can't predict the future;  this is only speculation.  Quite possibly doing nothing could be more beneficial for the future of bitcoin, as it incentivises scaling solutions to happen sooner, and allows us to move sooner towards a fee market which is necessary for the long term viability of bitcoin.


His argument is, why make these problems worse?  Why further incentivise centralisation, when we are just going to hit up against the same problem again once 20MB blocks are full.  Really, increasing the block size is just can kicking at the expense of decentralization.

But that again relies on the two parties not co-operating to move the funds earlier to whatever address they want.  It's the same as the single signature scenario, just with two parties that have to come together.

Mining investment doesn't determine fees, in the same way that the cost of mining a bitcoin doesn't determine their price.  That's a tail-wags-dog way of looking at it.  If the block yield (ie. subsidy + fees) goes down in real value, mining investment drops.  If it goes up in value, mining investment increases.  To look at it another way - all money invested in mining is done so because it is expected to make a positive return based on expected BTC returns + the future price of BTC.  Hence mining follows block rewards, it does not lead it.
If bitcoin hit a bear market and dropped down to 10 cents in price and stayed there forever, we'd still have a block every 10 minutes.  Big miners would go out of business because they're now only earning $2.50 per block.  This would be barely noticeable to users at all - we'd just see mining difficulty trending down (and perhaps a longer average times between blocks while this trend plays out).  The the real problem would be that the cost of a 51% attack would become cheaper and cheaper.
If all miners go out of business, I can support the blockchain with my CPU.  Hence there is no high cost to mining other than that caused by competition.
So the question to be asking is not "will fees be enough to support the cost of mining?", but rather "will fees alone be enough to support adequate security of the blockchain?"
The answer depends on what the future entails for transaction volumes / block size.

Full nodes only serve the peer to peer network by making blocks and transactions available to bitcoin users.  However, they do not and cannot secure the blockchain.  For the blockchain to work we need mining, and lots of it.  Without mining, we can't have a decentralized and trustless consensus.
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:01:44
But you don't earn any coins doing that.  The blocks from the future pay out to the future miner's address.  You don't know the private keys for those addresses.
@_date: 2015-01-24 07:19:46
That's not really relevant.  The purpose of the cartel would be to drive the total network revenue up.  Competition amongst miners effects profitability, not revenue.  There will always be competition no matter how much revenue is on offer.
@_date: 2015-01-07 10:03:05
No.  Like every other bitcoin hacking that has ever happened, the attacker either directly stole the privkeys by gaining access to their hotwallet server, or the keys/signatures were generated insecurely using a bad RNG.
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:11:57
The price moves to form an equilibrium between supply and demand.  Supply comes from the people who want to sell their bitcoins for fiat money.  Demand comes from the people who want to spend their fiat money to buy bitcoins.  As the flow of supply and demand changes, the price moves to reflect this. 
At this early stage in Bitcoin's life, demand is largely speculative, and so we see the price moving rapidly based on shifting sentiment and confidence.  There are also some fundamental factors that influence supply/demand, such as people buying coins to shop on online market places, or companies cashing out coins to pay their suppliers in fiat.

How much of that is cloud mining though?  If you think about it, cloud mining coins wouldn't be sold because the whole point is that you pay the fiat up front to get coins in return.
On the other hand, private mining pools would be selling to cover costs.

If you generated the key on an online machine, then you're at risk.
* Malware could have recorded the key and sent it off to a hacker, as soon as you generated it.  Now they're just waiting till they sweep it, incase you add more funds.
* Private key was written to disk on your online machine.  Although you deleted it, software could still recover it unless you've properly shredded it.
Best to generate your keys offline and keep them offline.  Even when you spend from cold storage, the keys should remain offline (sign the tx offline).  Otherwise it's not cold storage.
I'm just being paranoid here and picking holes in your strategy.
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:46:24
Miners don't decide on consus rules for anyone else. All they can do is leave bitcoin and start mining an altcoin (fork of the bitcoin blockchain). Nothing is stopping them from doing that, but it's unlikely to be as profitable as mining actual bitcoins, even in a fees-only scenario.
Altcoins need more than just hash power to get value.
@_date: 2015-01-19 02:00:02
Fine, but that's not really any different than now - we already know that if someone with malicious intent obtains 50% hash power, they can destabilise the blockchain.  They also can only keep up the attack so long as they are constantly funding it, all the while earning nothing.
Your scenario is just one where &gt;50% of miners decide to hold the blockchain ransom.  I can't see the whole world moving over to RansomCoin just because someone threatened Bitcoin.  Giving into threats is not what people do, especially when it comes to something as important as our monetary system.

If the rate of new transactions exceeds the rate at which they can be confirmed into blocks, then it's guaranteed that there will be an ever-growing number of transactions that have never confirmed.
Also, the oldness only counts for prioritizing the feeless portions of blocks, which is an optional policy for miners to follow.  The majority of the block space is prioritised by fee only.  Game theory says they should prioritise the whole block by fee.


Not everyone who wants an immediate confirmation will be able to get it, regardless of how much they pay.  If there's more people wanting next-block confirmation than there are slots in the block, it's mathematically guaranteed that people will miss out.  As network usage grows, the percentage of unsatisfied users will grow linearly with it.


There will be no growth without growing the TPS.
The blockchain is made for transacting.  The 1MB limit was set years ago to prevent theoretical DoS attacks.  It's time to increase it to allow the network to grow.

This article should have just said that they noticed abnormally large fees on some of Bitstamp's transactions.  That would have been a good enough revelation on its own.  Using the non-sensical phrase "high fee attack" is unnecessary.
My stab-in-the-dark guess is that the attackers may have gained RPC access to the wallet and were generating raw transactions, and somehow fucked up their calculations and ended up paying too much in fees.
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:03:03
Centralized e-cash has always been very easy to do.  It's not necessary to use a blockchain for it.  You could just have all transactions confirmed instantly in real time.
Bitcoin's strength is that it's decentralized, trustless, unseizable, censorship resistant, inflation proof, etc.  You don't get any of those features with centralized e-cash.
@_date: 2015-01-31 03:18:32
I had a skim of the whitepaper and it seems that there is a mechanism in the bitshares blockchain where stakeholders vote for "delegates" who are entrusted to publish accurate exchange rate data into the blockchain.  There are multiple delegates and an average of their pricing data is used to calculate the bitusd price that triggers the contracts.  The theory seems to be that if someone is publishing bad price data, the stakeholders can vote them out.

Read up on blockchain re-organisation.  The procedure is basically like:
- Find the common ancestor block of the two chains
- Unwind your current chain all the way back to the common ancestor, releasing all of the transactions into the mempool (pool of unconfirmed transactions).
- Now add each block from the new chain, 1 at a time, validating the transactions as you go, updating indexes etc.
- Viola!  You are now on the new chain.
The re-org happens whenever you notice that you're not on the longest chain.
@_date: 2015-01-19 11:05:23
Still depends on whether the forked chains follow the same consensus rules.  If it's a hard fork, no amount of mining will reconcile them.
To give a non-hard-fork example, imagine a minority of miners diverged onto their own chain, but they were still following all the bitcoin consensus rules.  In this case their chain is valid, but not the longest.  If, down the track, they overtake the main chain (by building more PoW into their chain), then they can release that chain to the network and the rest of the network will switch to it.  Even if it's thousands of blocks deep, the protocol rules say that the network will re-organise onto the longest chain.  The only thing that could prevent a really deep re-org is a checkpoint.  Checkpoints are hard-coded block hashes of old blocks that are compiled into bitcoin core.  I think their main purpose is to help with syncing though, they're not there for security.
@_date: 2015-01-31 02:10:39
Can someone TLDR how BitUSD is supposed to have a USD peg without counterparty risk?  This seems not possible to me, but I can't be bothered reading the lengthy white paper.
@_date: 2015-01-01 05:40:19
I'm of the view that the only thing that can drive the price up from here will be the price rising, which is somewhat paradoxical, but I think people's faith in bitcoin strengthens when the price goes up because it shows that everyone else has faith, and shared faith is what's needed to maintain a currency.
It might start to happen once there reaches a critical mass of casual buyers who create a price floor (maybe $300?).
Next time we bubble, there will be so much more infrastructure in place than last bubbles, including easier to use software/services, so hopefully more of the users will 'stick'.  I would love to see 10K+ transactions per block.  That's when it might signal enough economic activity that the economy could just continue growing organically on its own.
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:06:23
It's actually more like 3 TPS even assuming all blocks are full.  That's because real-world transactions are bigger than the minimum size that the 7 TPS figure is based on.

@_date: 2015-05-17 01:31:26
That's not consensus-compatible.  There's no way to trustlessly prove that a block wasn't announced with a &lt;1MB message.  Even the ability to successfully construct a block from an IBLT depends on the state of the mempool which is different for each node and again cannot be proven trustlessly.  It's trivial to show how your rule leads to a consensus split: a newly syncing node will accept a large block that was rejected by an already-synced node.
"Consensus" is a technical term in the context of bitcoin.  It refers to what we can trustlessly agree on in a decentralized fashion.  Everything related to consensus is secured by the PoW mining function.  There's no debate or interpretation to be had around what it means.

Yeah, that's the purpose of them.  It's possible because the private keys can't leave the device.  It can only output signed transactions.  It's secure because you have to physically authorise the signing by viewing the transaction information on the screen of the device, and pressing a hardware button to authorise the signing.
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:16:02
It's a good idea.  But I think you're better off generating a BIP44 seed, using a trezor or some similar device. At some point in the future he's going to want to try spending the bitcoins, and it's more secure if you can use a hardware device to do it.  Non-deterministic addresses are oldschool already and I think they'll continue to become more obscure in the future, so it might be difficult to find an easy way to spend them without involving a general purpose computer which introduces risk of theft.

Well clearly the world is quite happy with fiat currencies as well, since their market cap far exceeds that of gold and silver.  But gold and silver are still worth trillions, because people want a insurance plan against failing fiat currencies.  Especially now, if you follow what is going on with central banks and credit/derivatives, it's like a timebomb waiting to go off.
But now we have bitcoin which is not only a store of value independent of nation states, but it's also native to the internet and can be used as a practical transactional currency unlike metals which can only be hoarded.  So although it's not going to replace fiat overnight, it's going to be interesting to watch if/when peoples faith starts to move from fiat into crypto.

That's not a fork.  What you're describing would be the network being partitioned, so that some nodes aren't in contact with others.  A fork is different, and much more serious, where nodes disagree on whether blocks are valid or not.

Why buy anything when you can leave your money in the bank for an extra month and accrue a few more cents of interest.  If interest rates are above the inflation rate, it's the same scenario as having deflation.  No one should be buying anything.  Yet, we had decades where the world worked like that and people still spent money.
And now that all the debt has stopped people spending, they introduce negative real interest rates to try to force people to spend, and yet spending *still* doesn't happen.  So their theory is total bullshit.  If they wanted a healthy economy, they shouldn't have let it get so leveraged.

There's not just one measurement of profitability, because it depends on your energy costs and the efficiency of your hardware.  So there would be a spectrum where a small number of miners are extremely profitable, the majority are borderline, and some are operating at a loss.  If the price drops, the least efficient miners will switch off and difficulty will drop to compensate for it, but you won't see everyone switching off at once.

To understand this you need to understand a bit about the blockchain.
Greenaddress uses 2-of-2 multisig.  One key is yours, and the other key is greenaddresses.  This means that theoretically, they could refuse to sign (or they could dissapear) and the money would be left unspendable.
So to give their users more peace of mind, they pre-sign an nlocktime transaction.  It means you already have a transaction signed by them which spends the money back to an address that your key alone can spend.  But the presigned transaction is an nlocktime transaction which is only spendable in the future (I think they target around 90 days).  Once that nlocktime becomes valid, you need to move the coins to a new address, otherwise you wouldn't be able to use their instant confirmation feature because you could try to double-spend against merchants by using the nlocktime tx.
When moving the funds to the new address, it gives you the option to do it in a single tx (which would link all your unspent outputs together), or in multiple transactions, which doesn't link them, for the sake of privacy.

The mining power is irrelevant.  Replace the percentages with any other numbers and the outcome is the same - they're two separate currencies.

You can start verifying transactions just by running a full node.  But the verification is not a service to the network.  Running peer slots and serving blocks/transactions is, though.
No one is going to rely on you for verification.  Every full node does their own verification, and to some degree SPV wallets do a lesser level of verification.  That's what makes Bitcoin "trustless".
What miners do is add proof-of-work to the blockchain, which ensures we have distributed consensus on *which* valid blockchain is the true one.

You can set the gap to whatever size is necessary to fully recover your wallet. They addresses are all there in the bip32 tree, you just have to check them. Even if that means checking each chain until you see 1000 empty ones, that's still easy to do. Doesn't require a central service as you can do this via the p2p network using bloom filters. Of course, from a user perspective this would all be seemless and automatic as part of the wallet recovery process.
Edit: regarding the loss of the labels for friend names, that's a good point, but you would just have to re-friend them and issue a new chain. Possible there could be a "revocation" feature where you can publish a revocation into the blockchain that your friends can detect, so that they don't send any more money there (also useful if wallet was compromised). This could be implemented along the lines of the certificate revokation system that was recently posted on this sub.

The amount of money spent on securing the blockchain will be equal to the amount of rewards on offer.  I think everyone could agree on that since it's basic economics.  That amount of money also defines the cost of an attack.  So the question is whether the cost of an attack will remain high enough to ward off attackers.  Maybe it won't, in which case the network will undergo more and more attacks over time.  In this scenario of an under-secured blockchain, I think it's more likely that this type of thing would play out over a number of years where we see people slowly move their faith and wealth into another crypto as they begin to doubt bitcoin's security or long term viability.  Any new currency that surpasses bitcoin is going to have to go through the same network-building process of creating shared faith and a loyal following.  So we might see bitcoin's value sliding and another crypto gaining over several years, which would be the free market in action.  I don't think your scenario is very realistic where we have a sudden and violent hard fork coup and the world switches over to a new currency.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean there, but let me explain my point.  Lets put aside the issue of orphan blocks now, for the sake of simplicity.
If I'm mining at X hash per second, and the difficulty is Y, my chances of producing a block are completely determined by those two numbers.  Whether or not someone else is hashing as well does not effect me.  So, for example, if every single miner got nuked, and I was the only one mining, I'd still produce blocks at the same rate.
Once you add in orphan risks, then the network hash rate has a very small effect on your expected returns, because some of the blocks you find have a chance of being orphaned.

In that case you can simplify your proposal to say that block difficulty has to increase above network difficulty as the size of the block grows.  A simple linear example would be blockDiff = networkDiff * blocksize/1MB.  Or you could do something more complicated like, blockDiff = networkDiff * (blocksize / median-size-of-last-X-blocks)^2.
In any case there still should be a hard block size limit.

First the miner takes a list of unconfirmed transactions that they want to put in the block (they can choose this.. they can be any transactions so long as they are valid).  Then they build a merkle tree from that set.  The merkle root goes into a "block header" which also includes a timestamp, a reference to the previous block, a nonce field, and some others.
Then, in order to make the block actually valid, they need to add proof-of-work to it.  This is just a proof that a whole lot of computation was expended on that block.  They do this by varying the block header (via the nonce field and merkle root) until the hash of the block header is a sufficiently low number to meet network difficulty.  Then the block is valid and will be broadcast to the network.

Yeah I know exactly what you mean. When I offer to pay friends back with Bitcoin, they laugh as if it's some kind of cheeky joke.

To preserve bitcoin's most important property: trustlessness.  If I, as an average user, am not capable of downloading and validating all blocks, and storing the utxo set, then I can't use bitcoin trustlessly, and so it becomes just another centralised system where the users have to trust the miners not to cheat (eg. Double spending or breaking other consensus rules).

Yes.  If I had a secret key of "bob" then I could hash "bob1", "bob2", "bob3" etc to get as many private key as I wanted.  The private keys aren't related unless you figure out the secret.
That's not how BIP32 works, because that's more complex scheme which allows you to have a "master public key" which generates the whole sequence of pubkeys without being able to generate the private keys (so that you could have a watch-only version of your deterministic wallet).  BIP32 also allows sub branches which have their own master public/private keys, where all branches can be derived from the root seed.
But you have the general idea.

Miners are going to optimise for profit.  At the moment that means prioritising by fee-per-kb.  It's not "programmer" logic, it's economics.  Bytes inside a block are the scarce resource - there are only 1 million bytes available per 10 minutes, and miners want to fill that space with the transactions that will earn them the highest fees.
To have a different fee model would require the consensus rules to change in order to make the "profitable" strategy for miners the one that maximises something else (like outputs in your example).

A majority of miners could defraud you. Eg. they could have changed the rules of bitcoin to pay themselves more money, or could have included double spends, invalid signatures etc. That's why trusting utxo means trusting miners, just like SPV except with your system you are only SPV to a certain block height and then do full validation after that.
I don't think exponential growth in computing will stop for a very long time. As long as there is exponential growth, the blockchain size is only some constant times the latest technological throughput.
EDIT: BTW my comment was assuming exponential growth in the blockchain.  As it stands, with the 1MB limit, the blockchain can only grow linearly, therefore exponential technological growth has an asymptotic advantage, which means that the time required to validate the blockchain tends towards 0 over time.  However, if BIP101 is deployed, the blockchain growth rate changes to exponential.  In that case, exponential technology growth combined with exponential blockchain growth means that full blockchain validation is bound by some constant amount of time on the latest hardware.
The danger is if we get to a situation where technological growth becomes linear or constant, and blockchain growth remains exponential.  Then we will inevitably lose the ability to validate the whole chain from scratch.  However, I think the blockchain will fall back to linear growth before moore's law finishes.

@_date: 2015-07-06 13:15:14
It has to be a case of broken code.  If pools were permanently SPV mining, they'd never be able to include any transactions in their blocks (Because without fully validating, they don't know if a transaction is a double spend.  This is why they mine 0 transaction blocks until they finish full validation).

@_date: 2015-07-08 21:19:09
Which is good, because that helps to discourage bloating of the UTXO set, but it doesn't incentivize cleaning of old bloat.  You want to *encourage* wallets to sweep many small inputs into a transaction, rather than penalising them for it.

I like GreenAddress, but it does seem to add overly high fees a lot of the time.  And the fee rates vary wildly, eg:  I just checked my last 3 transactions:
1) 1203 bits per kb on 3rd July
2) 299 bits per kb on 9th June at 7:59
3) 811 bits per kb on 9th June at 7:56
The rates for  and  are very high, even under spam attack conditions.
Also, notice how transactions  and  were only three minutes apart but had wildly different fee rates?

I don't think the problem is so much around affordability as it is around usability of the software.  The users probably had no choice in the fee, or if they did, they weren't adequately informed of the delays.  We're talking about a matter of cents here.  Like, pay an extra few cents and your transaction will confirm just fine.

@_date: 2015-07-07 21:03:53
Very cool!  So here's an idea.. how about for unconfirmed transactions, show the fee as high, medium or low?
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:45:16
But that's the whole point. If he double spends to your address and some other address, there's no guaranteeing which tx will be confirmed. If it were possible to do what you are asking, zero-conf would be secure.
@_date: 2015-07-04 23:50:23
My hunch is that they *are* only SPV mining for the few moments it takes to validate. There was probably a bug where their code didn't properly handle the situation where a block fails validation.
See this image which shows that all their invalid blocks had 0 transactions. 
This indicates they never came out of SPV mode. Normally in the past they *do* put transactions in their blocks, which presumably happens when they come out of SPV mode.
So I'm guessing it was a bug rather than them not even bothering to validate any blocks at all.

This effect gives an intrinsic cost per byte floor on block space.  For example, a 200 byte transaction adds 160 microseconds of transmission time on a 10mbit link.  The expected orphan cost from this delay is 0.00016 / 600 * blockreward = 666 satoshi in the 25BTC reward era.
This floor isn't enough to ensure miners earn money long term, since it halves every 4 years.  As the block subsidy drops towards 0, miners would attach cheaper and cheaper transactions as the lower fees are enough to cover the orphan risk.
Fee pressure can provide a much higher price per byte since it's based on supply and demand, and the prices aren't affected by the subsidy halving.

You may have to export your private key, load it into a client that lets you produce raw transactions (like bitcoin core), and then submit it to Eligius or some other pool that implement CPFP.  It's not going to be easy if you don't have that kind of technical knowledge.
@_date: 2015-07-07 12:33:21
But even under today's massive DoS attack, the threshold to make it into the top 1MB of the mempool was around 400 bits.  So adding a 1200 bit fee is 3x too much, even under a stress test scenario.
edit: Interestingly, that page also shows Bitcoin Core's estimates, and they are 3x as high.  I assume GreenAddress must be using core to do the estimates.  It appears that btc core is way overzealous with the fee estimates..

You generate a mint transaction in the sidechain by showing an SPV proof that you froze some coins in the main chain.


The sidechain is backed by bitcoins, so the most logical thing is to peg the sidechain to bitcoins, but I'm not sure if sidechains have to strictly follow that.  Either way, whatever happens on the sidechain can't cause any inflation in Bitcoin.


I don't think so.  To recover the frozen bitcoins requires providing an SPV proof that coins were destroyed on the sidechain.  The sidechains implementation will dictate what this proof must look like, but I imagine it will be PoW only.

K so I tried this is Sydney, Australia using my Android phone.
First I clicked the link in this post to load your web page. Strait away it's showing me a card number and allowing me to deposit BTC - perfect, no signup.
I click the link to pay with my wallet and android launches a menu asking me which wallet I want to pay with - green bits, mycelium, bitcoin wallet, etc. I chose my desired wallet and it was already prefilled with the transaction, which it said was for "US $3.98".  Great - I realise this must be the 20% discount. I hit send.
By the time I return to my browser, the page has already updated to show $5 on the card. I had wondered about conformations, but it appears to be zero-conf. Splendid.
Now the real test comes. I fire up Google Maps and search for my nearest Starbucks store. There's one in the shopping mall across the road - easy. I go there and ask if I can use this card.
The guy scans the card and prints out a statement: US $5 on deposit. The slip also contains an "Exchange Rate Information" section that says it's worth AUD $6.41 in local currency.
I pay for my AUD $4.40 latte using the card.
He prints another statement showing USD $1.57 remaining on the card. Exhange rate AUD $2.01.
I return to my browser and hit "refund". It asks me for an address. I have to switch apps and use the "copy address" feature of my wallet, then paste it into the web page. I hit send and the transaction hits my wallet.
Overall, the AUD $4.40 latte cost me 0.0122 BTC, which equals AUD $3.55 at my current exchange rate. This represents a discount of ~19.3%.
Overall, 5 stars!

The "blockchain without bitcoin" thing seems to be reaching Peak Circlejerk.


This has never been true and never will be true.  Altering past data in the blockchain is possible, it just has a price.  That price is determined by the amount of money invested by competing miners.  If the network doesn't collectively pay miners, their earnings could be small enough that altering past data becomes cheap enough that people will pay to do it and will profit from it.


Bitcoin as a currency is the most well-established use case for the blockchain, and today are plenty of successful business models based on it.  The usage of blockchains as a general purpose ledgers without currency is non-existant outside of experiments / PoC and there are "lots of questions" about how they will secure the ledger without a sufficient incentive for miners.

- I'd like to be able to just deposit some amount of BTC.  Does it always have to be $5 or $10 exactly?
- Can you make bookmarkable URLs so that I don't have to register my own login?  Like when you play satoshidice, the URL has a secret seed to identify the user.

I assume you mean the internet, not just the web. As long as there is some way to send information to someone, bitcoin can function. You would have to cut all communication entirely. There are already projects to help prevent against this kind of situation, such as Geoff Garzik's BitSat project. Also, look into MeshNets. They are a way of decentralizing internet access, and Bitcoin makes it economically possible to run those networks.

In my opinion, the growth of BIP101 is too aggressive.  See my charts at  for an illustration of the growth over time.
My own personal hope is that I can run a fully validating wallet on my cell phone at some point in the future.  BIP101 doesn't cap the limit low enough to guarantee I will be able to do this, since it aggressively grows at 50%, which networks are unlikely to outpace.  Not to mention the once off 800% increase that kicks in at the beginning.  I also don't like the abrupt stoppage at 8GB which afaik has no apparent reason.  Do we really want to be having another block size debate in 2040?
I think SIPA's growth rate of ~17.7% is better, since that will likely grow slower than networks improve, which means my cell phone dream may come true, and leaves me spare bandwidth to have available for other cool applications running on top.
Garzik's BIP100 is not the right solution IMO as it gives too much power to miners who may not have the rest of the network's interests in mind, and leaves us with no certainty on where block sizes will go.  Worst of all, it hits a limit at 32MB, leaving us at another hard fork debate in the not-too-distant future.
Block size is something that can be algorithmically fixed just like the coin supply, so I prefer the approaches by Sipa and Gavin Andresen which fix it via a mathematical function.  My unscientific recommendation would be for something like: start at 4MB, grow at ~20% pa.  We will lose some decentralisation at the beginning, but it will get clawed back over time due to the slower growth rate.
@_date: 2015-09-03 02:42:17
Estimate the average size of a transasction, and divide the block size by that to get transactions per block, then divide by 600 for the "per-second" figure.  Eg. 8GB block size with an average of 500 byte transactions = 27306 transactions per second.
You should probably assume that the average transaction size will be larger in the future than it is now, because going forward there will likely be more sophisticated contracts in the blockchain, eg. lightning settlements, sidechain proofs, multisig, etc.

A 51% majority can control the outcome of the votes anyway. They simply orphan any blocks that don't vote in agreement. So the 20% rule is more of a gentlemans agreement than an actual enforcable consensus rule. IMO the threshhold should be a simple majority voting to increase or decrease, ie. &gt;51% as this allows the mining majority to exercise their power without having to start an orphan war.

The miner doesn't broadcast their dummy transactions.  They just include them in their own blocks, so the other miners cannot steal the fees (unless they want to orphan race them).  It also doesn't matter how low the legit transaction fees are, because the miner can always include a high enough dummy fee to bring the average to whatever number they want, without it costing them anything.

To make your music "uncopyable" then you're going to need DRM as well.  For example, a TPM could verify a blockchain proof that the user owns a copy of the music, but that *would* require fully validating the blockchain, as we don't yet have SPV proof that an output is in the UTXO set.
And how about the fact that this would require a blockchain transaction every time a copy of music changed hands?  Transaction fees would kill the secondary market for trading low-value goods like a music single.

Your phone can be a calculator.  I'm talking about being able to carry about a bitcoin wallet with you, which is completely needed in order to pay at physical stores, or to make any form of payments on the go.  So there should be no debate that mobile bitcoin usage is an essential use case (unlike paying from a pocket calculator).
Is it too much to ask to have trustlessness (full validation) in such an essential use case that will only come to dominate more and more in the future? (just look at the explosive growth rates in mobile e-commerce)

Only when used in combination with the locktime transactions.
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:09:35
With greenaddress, your money is stored in a 2-of-2 multisig address. Your seed only provides the keys for 1 of the addresses. 2-of-2 means you *must* have greenaddresses signature to spend the money, and only they have the 2nd key. However, for peace of mind, they use their 2nd key to pre-sign an nlocktime transaction that spends the money back to an address under your control after a certain time. This allows them to have veto power over your spending in the short term, but gives you the power to eventually recover the money if they ever stop signing (as with this case where they won't sign because he can't prove his 2nd factor). That's why it's important to hang on to the nlocktime transactions and not lose them.

@_date: 2015-03-26 20:50:54
You should receive the signed transaction strait away. The 90 day waiting period is for the locktime to expire so that the tx becomes valid. It's the posession of the pre-signed transaction that gives you the comfort of knowing you can always get your money out. You don't want to be waiting on them for a signature because that means you could lose your money if they are unable to sign for some reason.

@_date: 2015-03-25 08:22:44
A majority of miners (ie. &gt;50%) can collude to steal the coins that back the side chain.  It's because claiming pegged sidechain coins only requires an SPV proof, not a full proof that you actually own coins in the side chain.
That's why you can only really have a secure sidechain if almost all of the bitcoin miners are also merge mining it.  So the idea of sidechains delivering free innovation with no barriers and no permission doesn't quite work out in reality, because miners will be the ones who decide which sidechains to support.
@_date: 2015-02-10 09:11:10


Citation needed.  There's a whole section in Satoshi's paper on the probabilities of rewriting the chain after falling X blocks behind, and the numbers are not affected by the block interval.
The only thing I can see it changing is the severity of orphan risk, which favours those who have a larger % of network hash rate, so a smaller block interval would encourage more centralisation.

I said quadratic (not exponential), and I was referring to the bandwidth requirements.

SPV doesn't connect to a "trusted node".  It doesn't need to trust peers, other than being vulnerable to a sybil attack, which full nodes are also vulnerable to.  The only added trust compared to a full node is that you're implicitly trusting the longest chain to follow the correct validation rules.  So the main vulnerability is that a 51% attack could fool you into accepting counterfeit bitcoins.

Libor was a figure made up by banks, of course that could be rigged.  Bitcoin is a cryptographically secured commodity and if they want to obtain bitcoins they have to *actually* buy real bitcoins.  Even the gold market is dominated by paper contracts and there is very little physical settlement compared to the amount of paper traded.  Bitcoin is a different story because it's basically zero cost to take posession of bitcoins and delivery is done instantly over the internet.  Also, bitcoin reserves can be cryptographically proven so that we don't have to guess about the reserves and liabilities of an exchange, we can have it proven and this should hopefully become an industry standard amongst bitcoin companies.

@_date: 2015-02-12 12:47:00
Blockchain growth is linearly bound (at most MAX_BLOCK_SIZE per 10 minutes on average).  Whereas the capacity of computers to process/store/transfer information grows as an exponential function.  Asymptotic analysis says that there will inevitably come a day when the blockchain will be small enough to fit on even the most basic low-end computers, and from then on it will never be a problem again.  That may take several decades before it happens though.

It wasn't.  The fact that block 342462 contains block 342461's block hash in its header is cryptographic proof that it came after.  The timestamps are just nominated by the miners and the timestamp rules don't require them to be strictly in sequence.

Bitcoin pubkey hashes (or more generally "addresses") are just 160 bit numbers.  You can send bitcoins to any 160-bit number you can come up with, including the hash of a document.  No, you cannot reverse a public key to derive the private key, let alone reversing a pubkey hash.  That is the nature of asymmetric cryptography and cryptographic hash functions and it's the reason why bitcoin is secure.  So no you can't ever spend the coins from those addresses.
@_date: 2015-02-02 09:22:38

@_date: 2015-02-04 11:44:19
I thought of a better way to say this.
Lets imagine there are two Bitcoin miners.  Miner A and Miner B.
Miner A happens to run a fully validating node on SamsSuperSideChain, so he is fully aware of the rules of this sidechain.
Miner B has never heard of this silly little side chain.
A new sidechain transaction appears in the Bitcoin blockchain containing a SPV proof, claiming some of the coins that were backing SamsSuperSideChain.  Although it was produced by a mining majority, the block it refers to is invalid.. lets say the script signatures aren't even valid.
Miner A, being a fully validating node, knows that this is fraud.  Miner B has no way to tell whether its fraud or not, he just trusts the SPV proof.
What happens now?  Does Miner A just have to accept the fraud, even though he knows the sidechain block was invalid?

The block propagation time / orphan risk issue is actually an opposing force that wants to keep blocks smaller. So in a way that is *helping* decentralization. Although, IBLT's promise to neutralize this effect.
Hard drives only need to be big enough to store the utxo set. Blocks can be pruned after they are validated.
The real issue is bandwidth. To run a fully validating node, you need to receive every transaction. So your connection has to be fast enough to support this. And, if you want to bootstrap a new node, you need enough bandwidth to *catch up* with the whole blockchain, and there need to be enough nodes with upstream capacity to send you those blocks.

@_date: 2015-02-01 03:57:12
Yeah, however there might not have been so much dumping of those coins because the goals of miners has changed. Originally the hobbyist miners would mine because they wanted bitcoins.  Now the industrial miners mine because they want to fight to become industry leaders. I mean, that must be the goal of VCs who throw tens of millions of $$ at these mining companies. They want to see long term growth and a large eventual payoff, not looking for short term profitability. It's all about competing on speed, efficiency and scale to survive where the others fail. And so the BTC income is just some revenue to help fuel their ongoing operations.

Of course it can't simply be changed. It's far from simple right now (just look at this thread), why would a hard fork be simple when we're doing 20 million transactions per day? And gavin's fix is intended to be future proof, factoring in anticipated growth in bandwidth. If it pans out like that, there won't be further room to push it.
There will probably have to be more trust put in miners through things like utxo commitments.

A hardfork is different to a regular release of the software.
The difference is that, with a normal release, any blockchain that the new version considers valid would also be considered valid with the old version.
Under a hard fork, a blockchain considered valid by the new version will not necessarily be valid under the old version.  This means the two groups can (and inevitably will) diverge onto separate chains, effectively splitting the network into separate blockchains (aka separate currencies).

There is nowhere near 40% of the market available for purchase.  Most bitcoins are locked away in cold storage.  I doubt you could find 1 million bitcoins across all orderbooks and all other channels for purchasing, yet there are ~14M in existance.
Plus, right now there are 3600 coins per day being mined, so you wouldn't be able to prevent that supply hitting the market.  You'd have to constantly soak that up if you were trying to drive the price up.
Dumping 40% of coins also sounds impossible because there isn't enough fiat to prevent the price from crashing through the floor.

When they described sidechain security they compared it to a soft fork example with an OP_TRUE command.  So in their example, a person who hasn't upgraded to the soft fork can be fooled by a mining majority into accepting a chain even though it's invalid according to the new post-softfork rules.
To map this analogy to sidechains, I'm imagining that a person who is unaware of the rules of the sidechain is like an SPV user who can be fooled, and someone who is actually running a full node on the sidechain would not be fooled by the bad SPV proof.  So doesn't this mean that some bitcoin miners could see the sidechain proof as invalid, and others think it's valid?  Wouldn't that mean that we could have a consensus fork in the main network?  Or do bitcoin miners need to accept sidechain transactions even if they know they are invalid, because they meet the SPV proof requirements?
Not sure if my question is very clear.. but I tried..

I thought carbonwallet uses electrum seeds, so it wouldn't allow arbitrary passphrases.  If this is the case, perhaps it's recognising them as some kind of null word, so its opening up the same wallet that many people would have opened already.

Bro, bitcoin is volatile, we all know that.  This latest drop is from the China news.  Bitcoin is growing up and getting attention from governments now - any serious bitcoiner knows this is an expected step in its journey.  There will likely be far harsher crackdowns to come, and more price volatility, but none of this changes the fundamentals of bitcoin.  This is just one battle in a war of cryptocurrency vs traditional banking that will play out over the years to come.

Please read up on how Bitcoin works.  Once you have 1 confirm, your fee makes *no* difference to the speed of subsequent confirmations.  Confirmations will come at the same time for everyone.  It happens when a miner finds a new block.  It's a completely stochastic process so you can't predict when it will occur.

From the bitcoin wiki on "race attack":


If a merchant keeps their node secret, or doesn't accept incoming connections and connects only to trusted nodes, the attack can't be pulled off with any reasonable probability.  To make things worse, a failed attempt could leave the attacker out of pocket.

What it demonstrates is the amazing power of satoshi's creation.  People now have the ability to mint their own currencies and start trading them, peer to peer without intermediaries to stop us.  This was never possible before the creation of bitcoin.  There was no such thing as a digital asset that couldn't be cloned a billion times like an mp3 file or a movie.  Now we have actual tradeable digital commodities, and it's great that people are exercising their power to create them, dogecoin included.
One thing about all these new alt currencies is that they all get their value via bitcoin.  Like, the only way to buy doge is via doge/BTC.  There is no USD exchange for it.  There is no direct USD avenue to buy any of these coins except BTC and LTC.  Bitcoin is like the gateway from fiat wealth into crypto wealth.  Once you've got crypto wealth you can trade amongst hundreds of these currencies.  I think for that reason, Bitcoin will always have the most value since it's where all the fiat liquidity is.

Hmm, I read through the downvoted quark comments and not one person mentions why it's "more secure" than bitcoin.
Throwing additional hash functions are the mining PoW does nothing for security.  SHA256 isn't broken, and if one day it does get broken and exploited then we'll know when the network hashrate starts skyrocketing, and can patch it at that point.
Let me guess, quark uses the exact same hashing scheme as BTC to turn pubkeys into addresses (ie. RIPEMD + SHA256)?  And it uses the exact same signature scheme?  So its just another bitcoin copy that adds no extra security.

Bitcoin inflation is higher than any other currency's inflation, but the nature of the inflation is different.  The fed can print however much they see fit, for however long they want.  Bitcoin has a pre-determined inflation schedule and so this is already priced in to their market value.  If anything, the high rate of bitcoin inflation should be providing selling pressure on the market, but despite this we see the market cap increasing dramatically.

I believe we're currently in an altcoin bubble.  Speculators are throwing a few BTCs into altcoins in case they become worth something in the future.  There's probably about 50 altcoins that are listed on exchanges right now?  I think the bubble will pop when we start to get to 1000, 2000, or 5000 altcoins on exchanges.  People will start to realise that it's just ridiculous and that there can only be a few with value.

Yep.  After the first confirmation, you're in the blockchain (assuming the block that confirmed you doesn't get orphaned).  Getting into a block in the first place is what you pay fees for.  After the first confirm, you're just waiting for the chain to grow.  You can watch  to see the blocks coming.  It's random, so if you're unlucky you could be waiting hours, but it should take ~50 mins on average for the additional 5 confirms.

The idea suggested above was not DIY though.  He was saying that Casascius could supply the coin unfunded, but with the keypair stuck on it as usual.  The recipient can fund it themself.  When buying a cascacius coin, the seller can check the address to see if it's funded.  The private key security is exactly the same - if the seller knew the private key, it means they've removed and re-stuck the hologram, which if possible would also be an attack on pre-funded casacius coins.
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:52:05
It's more secure if you generate your own keypairs.  As trustworthy as Casascius may be, you still have counterparty risk.

Seriously dumb question.  There is no "server side software".  Every node runs the same software, which is basically bitcoind right now, and then there are other wallets which sit on top of that or use SPV.  There aren't clients and servers.
Anyone is free to make modifications to the bitcoin source code since it's open source, just like anyone is free to make an altcoin.  The key thing is adoption - will anyone actually use your software?
The recent block size change was just tweaking the default value for a setting that miners could have changed before.

Very interesting.
I suppose a payment processor could fight this type of attack by having many nodes around the network, especially peered with pools, and waiting ~10s or so (propogation time) to see if a double spend hits any of their nodes.
Also, the scenario where the double spend backfires is this:
Say you are at the checkout in a store, about to pay for an item.  So you sign one transaction that pays the merchant, and another that pays yourself with the same coins.  Then, since you have no special access to the merchant's node, you simply send the two transactions to 2 random bitcoin nodes that you think are far enough apart in the network.  The possibilities are:
A) Merchant is in the half of the network that sees you pay the merchant.  They accept your payment, and possibly the double spend occurs is successful if your self-payment hit a miner who finds a block.
B) Merchant is in the half of the network that sees your self-payment, and so you are just standing there at the checkout and they are saying "we haven't got your payment", and you are just kinda holding up the line.  At this point you have 3 options:
  1) stand there waiting for next block.  if it has the merchant payment, then you ended up buying the item.  if it has the self-payment, you can re-attempt payment again and try another double spend.  this seems impractical as you would be standing there awkwardly asking them to wait for so long.
  2) try another double spend with different coins.  this could backfire because you could end up paying them twice.
  3) put the item back and walk out of the store.  then, next block, if the payment to the merchant is confirmed, you're out of pocket since you didn't get the item.

Correct, it has the same effect on the market as someone selling on an exchange.  It's just a different exit strategy.  However, it's more beneficial to Bitcoin because it's actually growing the bitcoin economy.  As there become more and more places to spend them, they become more desirable.
