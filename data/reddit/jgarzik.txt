DNS seeds are not required for operation, just makes life a lot easier.

There are three methods of transactions on the 21BC:
1. Normal, on chain
2. Payment channels (coming soon)
3. Off chain via 21 pool/server
On-chain transactions and Payment channels are open to anyone - no 21BC needed.  You currently need a 21BC for off-chain microtransactions (  I think that requirement is slated to change in the future.

Full story:  Many BIPs including BIP 100 possibly featured large steps.  This potentially creates a supply shock.  Smaller steps create less economic shock, other things being equal.
My simulations were around +45,000 bytes per diff period (2016 blocks).  Rusty Russell was looking at a per-block increase - credit to Rusty for the best approach.
This satisfies one complaint of BIP 102, moral and logistical hazard of BIP 102's fixed limit returning the community back to this same point.  Obviously there is still wide debate over growth; if growth is exponential, small-bump-small-steps is still constraining.

Worker payouts require a standard bitcoin transaction fee.
In theory 21's pool could do that, but you would have to wait many hours (or days) for payouts to go out - poor user experience.  Workers want to get paid :)

Great question.  A full solution requires thinking about the "byzantine threat model"   i.e. How can people cheat the system?
Short answer - It's a demo.  :)  You know the worker's pubkey, but there is still a big gap where Sybil is possible.  In fact, for testing, I easily submitted multiple answers.
Longer term, workers build up reputation and the system can tune dynamically for that.
Opens the standard decentralized-reputation can of worms...   high value reputations can be sold and transferred.

Always known.
**The engineering purpose of bitcoin is to confirm transactions, to come to consensus on a stable, censorship resistant timeline of transactions.**
Unconfirmed is by definition insecure [from the standpoint of the blockchain service] and not stable.

The world is not so simple as users lobbying miners every three months.  Miners will be proactively transparent and aware of user needs - because the alternative is to publicly go against user needs for years, and presume that will have no impact on miner's own income - bitcoin value.
If you assume miners will misbehave so badly as to disservice bitcoin users for years on end, give up now :)  Miners already have the power to collude to censor transactions.
A new static limit is not a free market approach.  A new static limit implies another hard fork in the short term.  Making hard forks easy is a negative trend.  A new static limit also makes it impossible to make meaningful medium term plans about bitcoin.  Maybe hard fork  will go to 20MB?  It is unpredictable, and that means bitcoin's $3b economy is unpredictable.
A slower, long term, block vote reduces political/governance risks that are invisible but key to bitcoin's health.  A slow vote gives the free market plenty of time to voice its input in 1,000 little ways.  Avoid abrupt or unpredictable changes - those are market shocks.
BIP 100 provides the best _transition structure_ by simultaneously being slow + flexible by taking free market input.
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:36:21
The block size is already set by individual miners, as they choose which transactions, and how many, to put into a block.

21 API makes it really easy - that's the biggest advantage.

1. No, miners are not the ultimate authority on block limit, users are.
2. Yes, miners interests are aligned with users.  Miner income depends on token value and bitcoin usage.
3. You posit the unlikely assumption that miners will act in contra to users for years on end, in public, without user reaction, without impact on the token value that provides their income stream.
4. Failing on economics:  If you increase block size beyond a certain point, fee income is not maximized, fee income collapses.  Naive "miner always chooses max block size = max revenue" evaluations continue to fail.

Yep that's covered - perhaps less clearly - under problem  "Changing block size, when blocks are full, has a more dramatic effect on the market - suddenly new supply is magically brought online, and a minor Economic Change Event occurs."
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:33:07
It is not unrestricted freedom.  Velocity is key.
1. Users have months to observe and decide.
2. Agreement threshold is huge.  If you have 75%+ hash power misbehaving, you have bigger problems than block size.
@_date: 2015-06-14 14:35:20
...and the users will see that in advance, and have plenty of time to object.  If 90% of the hashpower is acting in contra to users wishes for months to years, miners income goes down.
All of your proposed automatic systems have the fundamental flaw of failing to take the market into account.  None of these systems handle the choice of miners and users to subsidize adoption by keeping fees artificially low, for example.
The central bankers remain - literally choosing the size of the fee market out of thin air.
You haven't fixed anything - you are still picking which businesses should succeed, and which should fail, based on who lobbies Gavin the loudest.
Voting occurs in a way that enables the free market to have its say.  Your suggested solution - another static size - does the exact opposite.
It is a fool's errand to believe that _the size and makeup of the fee market_ should be dictated by technical wizards picking a consensus number.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:12:42
False - users are not blind to behavior over months long threshold + elect into the system by choosing node software. Control at multiple levels. Users will not give value to a system they dislike.

What is needed is a method of injecting macro feedback into the decision of where to place the speed limit; market input, in other words.  BIP 100 does that; BIP 100 transfers an economic policy lever away from High Priest software developers.

It is easy to have a superficial analysis that snarks at post titles.  Reading the actual content, there are no contradictions.
Sometimes folks have difficulty separating short term and long term.
1. Short term:  Getting stuck at 1M core block size, or delaying core block size change for years, has notable  negative impacts for bitcoin - to bitcoin businesses, bitcoin development, possibly bitcoin price &amp; security.
2. Short term:  Layer-2 side chain and payment channel network solutions do not exist at the payment app (wallet) level.  It is unknown if they will provide at-scale censorship resistant payment services as of Dec 30, 2015.
3. Long term:  A single blockchain does not scale infinitely.  Putting video on the blockchain doesn't work.  All the coffee payments in the world onto one chain will not work -- but that is a distant future problem, and a good problem to have.
4. Don't bet bitcoin's health and future on technologies that do not yet exist, or were just written last week, or primarily advantage one company over many others.
5. It is better keep current users working, keep current system running, than engineer for some distant future possibility and distant future worry.  (If you can do both, sure, win-win)
6. _In context_, bitcoin-layer-1 is not and will never be an _instant payments_ system.
[Reading my 2013 blog post on block size]( you can see changing core block size was a question of _when not if_.
It is a conditions-based evaluation, examining system health, system economics,  the likely positive and negative impacts, the maturity of ancillary software (wallet, dbs, explorers, libs &amp; APIs), the total changes required to implement the change, the likely reactions of economic actors, and more.

This misses miner-miner direct connections.
You can observe how blocks propagate across the network, but cannot conclude that all miners are impacted by that propagation time.
US&lt;-&gt;Chinese miner is faster than US&lt;-&gt;network&lt;-&gt;Chinese miner.
@_date: 2015-06-25 22:13:41
A great question!  Bitfury internally is actually very *conservative* on block size - less aggressive than the Chinese miners.
BIP 100 is my own personal proposal, unrelated from any business associations.
Some associations want a conservative increase, some associations wants a large increase (generally the _non_ miners), and my own company Dunvegan Space Systems has a bias towards _no_ increase (satellite bandwidth isn't cheap).

Indeed.  There are a lot of naive "miner always chooses max block size" logic floating around.  There are economically rational reasons for miners to want to limit block size - drive up price of economically scarce resource.  c.f. DeBeers

There are always costs to including transactions.  Satoshi did a very good job of minimizing those costs, but they do exist.
Opportunity cost versus orphan blocks is the big one.  Complexity, verification speed and other intrinsics also have impact.
@_date: 2015-06-26 21:39:38
There's no immediate penalty, correct.
Ultimately that is bitcoin itself, today:  100% of miners are free to be selfish and mine blocks with zero transactions.
If they are all selfish, then nothing happens on the bitcoin network, and bitcoin dies.
@_date: 2015-06-26 17:30:48
Mostly correct..
* Very little direct financial compensation from fees right now.  Block subsidy (25 BTC) swamps fees economically.
* They restart their bitcoind processes all the time.  That's not an issue.
* The larger incentive for increasing the size is increasing the usability of bitcoin - which impacts bitcoin price - which directly impacts all miner income.

The specifics of how the users vote are specified:  via a 2nd hard fork.

32MB is a compromise, yes.  The original proposal did not have a cap, which made others dislike it.
It is also semantics:  a hard fork at 32MB would have likely been needed _anyway_.
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:03:56
It is simple math.  A single chip would work for 1000+ years without finding a block, in all probability.  Therefore, they must share their work or get paid nothing 99.99999% of the time.  Further, a phone will not have the full blockchain + a constant feed of transactions to verify.

Not immediately.  Velocity matters.  Users have a chance to simulate, test, assess, observe, react (negatively).
Further, the limit increase can be capped without impacting this proposal, similar to how difficulty increase is capped.
@_date: 2015-06-14 02:55:51
The community of full node owners votes twice:  Once when implementing &gt;1MB blocks, and once again at the forced (due to coincidental, historical reasons) hard fork boundary of 32MB.
Miners incentives are aligned with users long term.  Collusions, attacks etc must take place in months, in slow motions, for months at a time.
More importantly, critics fail to come up with a good alternative:  Other solutions -- including simply hard forking to a new static size like 2MB -- are fraught with central planning risk.  The block size limit _creates_ how the fee market behaves.  That power should not rest within software.
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:33:24
Incorrect.   Nodes are not simply one-way consumers of a single 20MB blockstream.  You serve those 20MB blocks to many others.
A single stream sync'ing is not the interesting use case.  One must calculate the true network traffic of a _block server_.  Many hundreds of thousands of times.

With due respect to Mike, the human element is what ultimately makes bitcoin resilient. No matter what current problems exist, there is a huge body of people with incentives &amp; knowhow to keep bitcoin going.
Real world example: March 2013 chain fork recovery. 
Theoretical example: If the core SHA256 hashing algorithm is compromised, software cannot automatically recover from that. It will be humans who decide the best course of action for the network to take. It will be other humans who evaluate that judgement, and agree (by downloading &amp; using new software) or disagree.

No it's not against the rules, but that completely ignores the economic analysis.
It is trivial to defend against in any case -- users will ignore blocks that fail to contain a sufficient set of transactions a block should contain.

The goal is solving one key problem:  Multiple posts on $topic tend to crowd out everything else.
No need for a complete redesign (though you're welcome to if you're motivated).  I also think that a fix is more likely to be seen and adopted by reddit.
My proposed solution was:
1. Consider redditas it is today.
2. The most upvoted Changetip post will appear as it does today.
3. The second, third, ... most up-voted Changetip posts will be (a) shown in a slightly smaller font size, and (b) both the up/down arrows and the post will be shifted to the right (indented).
However, that is just my idea.  Maybe someone has a better idea.
The deliverable is either a screenshot (photoshop'd?) or a non-working mock-up that presents the suggested design.

Not really that simple.  Quoting from a blog post I just wrote on the subject,
It should be noted that this fee reduction only applies to the suggested anti-spam minimums.  The actual fee paid by users is determined by what miners are willing to include in a block.  Reducing the anti-spam minimum fee should increase the chance of a transaction being relayed across the network to various miners.  This does not imply a global network fee reduction.  Transaction fees are and continue to be set by the mining market.

If you are already talking directly with the merchant's server, it is error prone and inefficient to rely on third party P2P nodes to communicate an important financial transaction to the merchant.

heh, This does not "ruin" the post.  Re-read the link on the LSB.  The Linux Foundation does not produce a Linux distribution, and pay hundreds of engineers and support personnel to support and maintain it.  The Linux Foundation is very small.
_"The Linux Standard Base (LSB) is a joint project by several Linux distributions under the organizational structure of the Linux Foundation"_
Key word: "distributions"   In the Linux ecosystem, the distros serve as funnels for changes going into the open source software.  Red Hat pays many engineers salaries to contribute to the Linux kernel, gcc compiler, and many other pieces of open source software.  The Linux Foundation employs five (5) so-called core developers.  Red Hat employs 50-100 or more.  Intel, the same.
I am very aware of the Linux Foundation -- the Bitcoin Foundation was modeled after it somewhat based on my recommendations.
The * Foundation is a vendor-neutral trade group, for hosting conferences, hosting community-agreed specifications, and employing a new key engineers.  The ecosystem is expected to provide 1000x engineers for each "fellow" employed by the Foundation.

With due respect to Mike, the human element is what ultimately makes bitcoin resilient.  No matter what current problems exist, there is a huge body of people with incentives &amp; knowhow to keep bitcoin going.
Real world example:  March 2013 chain fork recovery.  
Theoretical example:  If the core SHA256 hashing algorithm is compromised, software cannot _automatically_ recover from that.  It will be humans who decide the best course of action for the network to take.  It will be other humans who evaluate that judgement, and agree (by downloading &amp; using new software) or disagree.

It is self-evident this is not true.  The transaction spending the output shows... that it has been spent.

**This blog post is hyperbole a bit**.
In open source, you have several stages of implementation.  Proposed patch, pull request, master push, pre-release, release, bug fix, etc.
Even though my personal views on this specific change are documented, in light of this blog post, it should be highlighted that this change was merged _less than 48 hours ago_ into a _unstable development version_.
It is part of the development process that problems are highlighted and caught before final release.
**This is not suddenly a new way to crash bitcoind out there on the network** as some people are reading the blog post's reddit headline.
Sometimes newly merged changes are utterly broken and need reverting.  Sometimes they are utterly broken and need fixing.  It's all part of the open source process that the crowd sees _everything_, every wart, every step of the way.  Catching this stuff early, getting rapid feedback, is another important part of open source development cycles.

The bitcoin payment network is comprised of thousands of P2P nodes.  Every node on the network carries a complete transaction history back to Jan 2009 (the "block chain").
Miners are a subset of these P2P nodes.  ~100 miners out of 7000+ nodes, around 1.4%.
All P2P nodes _must_ follow the same validation rules.  If you do not follow the same validation rules, you get kicked off the island ("network partition").  Not 60% or 75%.  100% of the network _must_ follow these rules.
A hard fork is a change in the rules.
And those rules cannot change unless 100% of the network agrees.  Not miners... the network.
tl;dr This "Rune" person really has no clue how bitcoin works.

**Tracer spam**.
When you receive a tiny amount of bitcoins at an bitcoin address, some wallets will spend that tiny amount up by default, upon the next spend.  It either contaminates a wallet by linking it to stolen coins, or attempts to reduce privacy by fingerprinting a wallet.
It is one of many reasons why you should avoid reusing bitcoin addresses.

The satellites receive untrusted data from any ground station in the world, verify the blockchain data is valid according to bitcoin rules, then transmit.
Use cases:
* Anti-censorship.  It is more difficult for the Great Firewall of Country to censor the bitcoin protocol, if the data is coming from space.
* Local &amp; regional Internet outage.  Whether due to a normal outage or an attack, blocks keep flowing to your site in the event of a localized DDoS or Sybil attack.
* Expensive bandwidth.  A "full feed" of all blocks and transaction can be costly on mobile networks, or outside Western nations.  The satellite broadcasts for free, making the cost of reception == one time satellite receiver cost.
Thus this enhances site security, routes around censorship, enables remote or off-grid use, and enables people to use bitcoin who might have been otherwise prevented by cost.
It also opens the doors to broadcasting from space other "useful" data.
It does **not** save bitcoin from a worldwide Internet meltdown.

These are the steps:  tag, build, release.  Possibly with a branch or freeze prior to that.
Release binaries are built by multiple developers, who then compare signatures to ensure that everyone's build retains its integrity.  This guards against hacking a developer's compiler.

Side note:  The contributor statistics are wrong and do not match reality.  This is a known github problem.

This continues the trend of failing to speak honestly and plainly to bitcoin users.
1. These statements do not follow a neutral analysis template of (a) listing all benefits and risks for available choices, and then (b) outlining why a given path was chosen _despite_ the risks.
2. Specifically, there is no coverage of risks related to **soft forks forcibly downgrade user security**.
3. Soft forks greatly decrease the number of fully validating nodes on the network.  Greater trust and weight is placed on miners.
4. Normally, we rely on nodes to validate miner work (trustless).  Soft forks erode this ability.
5. The statement misleads users.  In reality, soft forks present users with a binary choice of (a) upgrade or (b) involuntary security reduction.  It is not a consequence-free choice.

Any change to the **rules that apply to all** is something that must be done with care.
All soft forks do is make it easier for a tiny few to enact changes that are enforced across all transactions on the network; this is not "opt in", because the post-soft-fork rules applied to all, regarding of their level of consent.
In the context of economic policy changes - dictating a direct change in the supply of a resource - enabling a tiny few to choose the new size of a resource is a risky new precedent for bitcoin.

This is an inaccurate portrayal.
Reading the code and pull request, one can see that the capability remains to prioritize transactions ("fee delta").
Any operator may choose to adjust the fee of any transaction, to boost its priority in arbitrary ways based on arbitrary conditions.
Thus, coin age can be one of the factors the local operator chooses to use.

Blatant obfuscation.
There is a new policy being put into place - "let a fee market develop" - which freezes out anything related to a size limit increase.
This new policy has not been communicated to users, nor any transition to the new policy planned.
You don't jerk around users this way.  Any new policy should be announced in advance.  Users should be given time to understand the new policy and transition to it.

The survival of bitcoin is _not_ threatened.
This block size issue is simply a major community choice of future direction.
Open source and transparency means airing the "dirty laundry" in public.  Debates about a project's direction can be contentious and ugly at times.  We don't have smoky backroom decisions - we have debates in the public square.

* Fact:  Several developers prefer to "let fee market develop" than continue old policy
* Fact:  Soft limit increase PR closed, executing new policy.
_This is not a judgement of the policy_.   This is an observation of moving away from years-long prior policy, with zero announcement or communication or user preparation.
Any policy change should include transition planning, testing, user communications.  This did none of those.

Bitcoin's original author and designer, Satoshi Nakamoto, points out that bitcoin is not and never was intended for microtransactions.
@_date: 2012-12-09 06:39:42
Quote: *it's not like "dust" or spam transactions are even occurring at all.*
This contradicts what SatoshiDICE.com says:
1) *If you lose, the return [is] your bet times 0.005*
2) [...tx fees...] *If this makes the payment amount zero or less the payment is set to 0.00000001.*
These SD practices generate "dust", tiny near-worthless outputs that are difficult to spend.  These clutter the global list of unspent bitcoins that the entire network must carry.
The bitcoin blockchain is not an instant messaging API.  Put the list of losers on a website somewhere off-chain. There are much better ways to tell someone they lost, than burdening the entire network with the storage cost of all those "you lost" messages.
A payment to SatoshiDICE is a transfer of *money*.  Payment of winnings from SatoshiDICE is a transfer of *money*.  A losing bet transaction from SatoshiDICE using worthless dust is transferring *information*.

It is important to distinguish between a currency and a payment network.  There is no global ledger of all US-Dollar transactions, ever.  Nor is there a single network for all US-Dollar transactions.
It is erroneous to assume that all bitcoin transactions can, should and will be 100% public and immediately published on the P2P network.
In a future world where bitcoin is the Currency For All, there would be multiple layers of payment networks and providers.  Micro-transactions can easily occur within a "micro-transaction network" that is a layer on top of the primary bitcoin blockchain network.
You can see an example of such a "layer" right here on reddit, with the tip bot.  You can send and receive bitcoin micro-transactions within the "reddit bitcoin network", and those transactions will only appear on the "real" bitcoin P2P network and blockchain when you cash out your bitcoins.  I have received several bittips (thanks!), but none of them show up in the blockchain.

Actually it is more fundamental than that:  block size is an economically limited resource, just like the famous 21,000,000 limit.
Increasing block size decreases scarcity, and thereby (a) decreases the incentive to conserve block space, and (b) decreases competitive bidding for the limited block space.
In other words, it is a bad idea to change willy-nilly, or even worse, remove the limit or vastly increase it.
The limit should only be increased due to absolute necessity.

It's not about the mining.  It's about the whole package - to me as a hacker, it's a great developer's playground for machine-machine automation.
You can experiment with microtransactions - charge 1 satoshi per API call for your service, using that base to built real time markets for APIs and services, with intelligent agents bidding based on price and available demand.

This is not true -- and what many PoS fans miss.
Bitcoin has many existing stakeholders.  If large mining pools misbehave, the network and the existing stakeholders can choose new miners -- and it is within their economic interest to do so.
**Separation of powers** means that stakeholders and miners are two separate classes.  Network nodes are third class of user, and network nodes serve to validate the work of all miners.
Unlike Proof-of-Stake, PoW offers multiple ways to enter the network: (1) find an existing stakeholder, or (2) mine your own stake from scratch.  According to the laws of physics etc. anyone can start mining at any time - permissionless entry.
Proof-of-Stake fundamentally does not offer permissionless entry.

@_date: 2015-03-16 21:45:40


This is 100% false.
Zero confirmation transactions are insecure, but that does not automatically make them risky -- because that logic completely ignores business risk and other factors.
Example:  Any e-commerce merchant shipping a physical good can accept 0-conf transactions, because the good is shipped at a later time -- after confirmations have started to appear.  The merchant has plenty of time to cancel the order.
Subscriptions are the same.  The merchant can easily stop or refuse service if payment shenanigans occur.

Nothing has changed since I said that - this community just sometimes has trouble with nuance.  :)
All of the below are true:
* If miners create blocks the network won't relay, they self-partition onto another chain.
* If folks choose new consensus rules without hashpower to secure those rules, that also creates network partitions.
Also standing by the observation that exchanges have as much or more power than miners.

Yes, that is the standing plan that already exists :)   Create dummy txns if needed and make sure miners are aware.

Bitcoin's 1,000,000-byte core block size is a supply-constrained economic resource.
The power to arbitrarily increase supply is in the hands of a few humans, with a SegWit soft fork.
Arbitrarily changing the size of a supply-constrained resource has obvious impacts as told in Econ 101: 
Bitcoin'ers cannot simultaneously cheer the inability for humans to change monetary supply at a whim - while cheering the ability for humans to change capacity supply at a whim.

Yes, that's a feature.  A SIN is as public -- or not -- as you choose it.  You may easily create multiple SINs if you want to compartmentalize.
Well aware of ZKPs, but do not think the general use case -- human or agent -- will find that property useful.
Most SINs are valuable precisely because they are reused, and build reputations.
It is possible to create reputation with ZKP, but given the general use will expose the SIN (hash of public key) during normal transactions, there is not much point.

Of course.  Anybody wants a product *now now now*.
Like it or not, pre-orders are what made bitcoin ASICs possible at all.
It is simple economics.  Huge amounts of up-front money are required to produce even a single unit of product.  Apparently, nobody in the bitcoin community had that lying around, so they had to raise money.  Some chose pre-order (Avalon, BFL) and some IPO (ASICMINER).
No one would have shipped ASICs, if it required "buy it, get it shipped to you within a week."  Such a product would simply not exist.
Now that the concept is proven, there is sufficient interest, competition and funding that pre-order is slowly dying away.
Just complaining about "no more bullshit" illustrates ignorance of the bitcoin hardware market as it existed last year.  Economic field experience -- the free market -- has proven what funding methods will produce hardware in low-investment environments.

You are sorely confused on multiple issues.
The data spam in question was not "directly placed into the block by the miner", it was stored using an upload tool which is itself embedded in the blockchain.
The data spam in question is stored as multiple transaction outputs, each of which spends 0.00000001 bitcoins to a bogus address, and a large transaction fee was paid to store the data.
You are referring to data stored in the coinbase transaction's scriptSig, which is not applicable to the current round of data spam.

That assumes all goes well, which is not necessarily a good assumption given a first-run product in a brand new market.
Also, the total number of units each company can ship is a hugely relevant factor.  If Avalon pumps out 300 units, then two weeks later BFL pumps out 3,000 units, the scales can tip either way.

While quite laudable to choose a provider that supports your personal values -- best practice dictates you encrypt everything, and make the issue irrelevant.
Spider Oak may be just be an unintentional honeypot for the spooks to sniff.
Complaining about a remote cloud provider being able to read your files is pretty silly.  Storing files remotely with *anybody* gives them that power, regardless of any policies.

Now, **please address the other problem**, bloating the network's most precious resource:  the Unspent Transaction Output set (UTXO).  Sending coins to unspendable addresses requires a permanent entry in the database of spendable outputs, because we must track them forever until they are spent.

Not sure I understand the comment?  Certainly real name and SSN two quite different things.
They are examples of key/value pairs you may digitally sign, and attach to your own SIN records.

leveldb can be improved upon, entirely agreed.  I know more than a little bit about this, having implemented my own replacement ("pagedb"), twice, once in python and once in C.
