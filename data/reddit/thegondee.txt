Your making the assertion that exchanges are competent and therefor tether must be solvent and legitimate. That is not usable logic. In reality we need proof of competency from the exchanges, and proof of solvency from tether. Either one can be mutually exclusive. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:57:04
The fraudulent part of the USDT operation is not the general trading. Someone is buying crypto assets on Bitfinex with the tether. After that point its in normal traders hands.

Very interesting resource. Thanks for putting me on to that! 
The number of outputs per block is also decreasing with the number of transactions per block. If people slow exchanging on chain, and the exchanges continue normal batching (or just slow down less- like it shows there), Outputs/transactions will increase in ratio. kind of misleading in the short term. Over the long term though and on a soothed curve, it looks to be a great way to watch for activity. Check the 30 day and 8 day EMA (listed on top) on it to remove short term distortions; it shows the ratio down 25% too

Spread is WAY to big

This is exactly what the devs need imo. Any fault of bug will quickly be found, and probably well publicized. Leading to quicker edge case debugging. Its open source, if ppl choose to risk they money to be beta testers, means they are interested in the tech and have a vested interest in making it work = they will be helpful if something is found 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:50:24
A lot of people see that there is a bubble, so when things get bad the go back to cash/safety and wait 
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:55:04
My thoughts. Some analysis of the tether that has been minted shows that its responsible for ~40% of price increases since last year. Meaning, of 91 times tether was minted, the 2 hours after it arrived at bitfinex is when for ~48 percent of all btc rise occurred. This mean the tether was having a pretty large effect, legit or not, on the market. They need to release a Audit to prove that this is legitimate money, because without banking relations its hard time reason they have raised 2.3 billion dollars of capital. Its the cryptospace is lawlessness; Ponzi's, ICO scams and fraud is pervasive, its not hard to reason this is a fraud. Bernie Madoff is another example of a fraud of this size of larger. It does happen

Is there mods on this page?
Also funny that only thing OP cares about is how much money he makes 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:05:54
Your not wrong. I don't think it can be thought of as a currency, and if it can, that world is a LONG way off. 
For my BTC is valuable becuase its consistent. The DEVS are not rapidly pushing code, locking funds up, etc etc. Its 100% reliable, and has always been, even when 90% of the miners tried to take over, it came through fine without a hickup. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:26:46
Actully it just that the price is down. And in this speculative market, low price = low interest... Its a time to accumulate BTC, not spend and trade it. 
You can clearly see it has nothing to do with segwitt or anything else. Just fewer transactions...
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:40:45
yeah, you could loose a lot of money. 
@_date: 2019-07-29 01:19:55
Seems like they sell your personal information, and I dont like having a browser plugin that can track everything I do online
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:00:13
Not going to click that
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:24:23
Don't listen to them. Sell the whole thing, and if you want to get back into crypto later do so.

Please lol
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:38:23
if it fails of course it will drop, lots of this price is speculation. IMO there will be a firesale if its a no, and then it will recover pretty quick.
I bought my BTC a long time ago so Im in a different boat, if I were you I would wait for the decision to decide. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:04:36
Gemani will allow you to trade with your bitcoins instantly, can't pull them off the exchange until it clears though 
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:46:48
Meh, they are citing trading volume, but no one knows what the real volume in china was pre controls.

Maybe we could take out a loan, but the moneys worth of BTC now, then after ad airs and the pump ensues cash her out and pay for it. Give winnings to funders.

Bloomberg terminal? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:52:55
Just download a wallet service like JAXX and use that man. Defiantly get your coins off that website, but imo shouldn't bother with paperwallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:18:43
Just transfer money to coinbase. Slide it into GDAX and boom, you can buy bitcoin feeless so long as you use a post-only limit order
@_date: 2017-01-12 17:17:53
I didn't have an issue with it, they are not watching you trade. You can restrict those permissions in your browser after if your worried about it. 
I have had no issues and I have put roughly 30k through them to buy BTC (and paid 0 in fees). Make sure to just deposit USD via ACH
@_date: 2018-10-09 20:51:38
Use XMR

Where is info on the austin BTC meetup?
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:05:25
I have used jaxx with no problems with a large amount of btc. As always, if you have your private key, you can switch at any time to another wallet 
@_date: 2017-01-14 04:39:49
Well if there is significant amount on it, you can pay a data recovery company to dig it back off the drive. Even if you "deleted it" generally its still on the hard drive, just marked as deleted and to be over written eventually. Its not cheap, but if you have many thousands in that wallet, worth it IMO
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:56:52


Blockchain.info has your private keys, meaning they could get hacked and or steal your funds. Jaxx wallet is stored on your own computer and you, and only you have the private keys and hence access to your BTC. 
Just download JAXX, create a good 12 word pass phrase (print that if you want too), and send your BTC from blockchain.info to the address generated by JAXX. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:33:50
I have not noticed this correlation, so I don't believe so.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:33:47
No need to be a dick. Ok I read directly from their site. 
They do have your private keys. They are encrypted in your browser before being stored on their servers. They cannot access them because they would need your password, which they use the usual hash +salt to store. You don't have your private keys until you use your password to decrypt them using their site. Hence you are dependent on the site unless you have previously exported your keys. 
Guessing passwords against a encrypted key is much easier than guessing private keys against the BC. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:04:08
How does the site work then? The keys can't be stored in a cookie or anything locally. I have never used the site
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:20:36
Based on what? lol
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:17:59
Ponzi, don't use it

I miss circle too. Damn
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:28:20
someone would need to give you that loan. Loan rates would likely be extremely high since bitcoin is volatile and scarce. You need credit to grow the economy and thus make our lives better year over year, BTC is not good at this function, and should not try to assume that purpose. If anything it would be ideal to take a loan against your BTC for FIAT, that way you can pay back your loan in a depreciating asset. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:35:59
They do have the private keys, albeit encrypted on their servers, as confirmed there in the link. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:22:41
Lol ok 
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:07:25
I don't think anyone WANTS to pay with bitcoin... I certainly don't. I want to pay with depreciating USD... 
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:05:43
lol this self soothing shit after this subreddit going ham on HODL is hilarious 
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:32:34
The EOS has more beta potental than Bitcoin/ETH, I would say that is a great move. And it is not a shit coin
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:33:03
EOS is one of the few cryptos that is NOT a shit coin lol.

All the traders are looking at the same graph, and it has become self fulfilling. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:56:36
Lets put this in perspective. The search term "What is bitcoin" is the highest its ever been by almost double on google. Coinbase is getting almost 100k new users PER day. We have futures that will being trading in a month. Things are going ok.
That said im going to move to other coins soon, as the gains are diminishing as BTC gets higher in price. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:38:11
He did his research and changed his mind. That should be encouraged...
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:33:40
Its not applicable to a lot of transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:44:02
Well it already broke 8k.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:57:47
Its falling with the price of BTC lol. it also has been rising with it. I doubt its very accurate 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:15:02
We have Segwitt is there now, not many are using it. We are just plain stuck with these fees until some researcher discovers another scaling solution (not linear increases like block sizes)
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:10:20
There will be a colossal dump after the fork with value being transferred to 2x chain. Would wait If i were you. Buy in the depths of FUD 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:34:15
But if your transferring a large amount, that fee is stunningly low
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:01:43
Of course there will be a dump after the fork. The lasting impact and size of the dump is what we don't know. B2X value will be taken out of BTC and transferred by the market. I expect 10-15% immediate drop. As far as 5 minutes after fork, there is no telling. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:05:06
Can't tell if your new to Crypto or have never looked at what happens during a fork lol
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:59:06
I have no issues with limits as well lol. But try getting bank paper work for them for a mortgage lol. I havnt received a reply still. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:58:03
It doesn't mean anything to those people. Majority of biz customers use Bitpay or something similar, which detects transaction propagating through the network to accept. As long as they don't see a double spend attempt propagating as well, they know the nodes will only accept that first transaction. They also check mempool. In the event of slow network conditions its not effected by congestion. 
So yeah, avg user doesnt need to do anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:13:54
Simple math would say that if you didn't sell at the 7500 level its better to hold now, get your 2X. Futures price of B2X puts BTC at 5700 post fork. I highly doubt it will go that low, and if it does probably wont stay long. 
If you have access to bitfinex margin, you can do both btw
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:17:08
They are onboarding almost 100k people per day. There is no way to scale out support that fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:30:24
In reality the miners don't send their Bitcoin to an exchange to be sold immediately. They either use Darkpools, some OTC sell for a big buyer, or they just hold. In reality it is only the BTC on the exchanges that determines the price. With a holding culture such as ours, even 1 billion entered now would moon us
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:55:30
Mostly just general speculation. 95% of all price movement and activity is speculative imo. news generally drive speculation. 
I use Cryptopanic to get a gauge

Please google what a 1099K is. It is not a 1099
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:00:59
I think the deflationary nature of bitcoin is one of the main reasons it cannot become a fully fledged replacement currency. Like it or not, the inflationary USD encourages massive reinvestment, on credit no less, in the economy. This produces booms and busts, but also produces high growth rates. An economy with a deflationary currency is doomed to a very low growth rate as people hold, forcing others to hold, and so goes the cycle. IMO it will become a store of value like gold, but not a currency like usd
