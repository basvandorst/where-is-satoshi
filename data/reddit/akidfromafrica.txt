btc was never close to $2 in 2010, so I think your years are off
@_date: 2019-07-21 08:46:05
Yeah there were, the first price on an exchange was from I think July 2010 at $0.06

No the only way to double your btc is send 0.5 btc to Craig Wright, and he sends you back 5 btc

Where are the outgoing transactions going? To your wallet or to another entity?

Can we stop with the "whale moves $$$$ for just a few cents". It gives the false impression that the fee is dependent on the value of money moved. It doesn't, it depends only on the number of input &amp; outputs. If they transfered $1, the fee would still be $0.32

noob here, how would a decimal sat fee work, I thought satoshis were the smallest denomination possible.

Because there are only so many trx/sec you can do. If everyone uses it, it gets incredibly clogged up

Easy, start with &gt;100 btc.
Trade altcoins, now you have 25 btc.

In that case, the other entity decides which address they give you to pay to. Not much you can do, unless I misunderstood the question
@_date: 2019-11-10 19:41:31
Yes, but it is also a technical problem, it is difficult to commit (write) a high amount of transactions while keeping it decentralized also.
@_date: 2019-11-16 10:26:32
because it will definately go higher, duh
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:58:46
Its simple.
If you have the private keys, you control it. If you don't have the private keys, then the wallet/service controls it.

If hardware continues improving (which it will), then it will eventually be very easy to run a full node on your mobile phone.

nope. In fact, you don't even need to be online to recieve a transaction.

Have you considered acquiring a billion dollars. You would have 0% fees that way.

what are the largest btc communities outside of this subreddit?
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:31:29
this is good for bitcoin

Are you talking about the theoretical minimum,  or how long it will take practically

How many lambos do you have in your lambo account?

It's amazing how many people saw that UI, then went "yep, this looks like a great investment!"

There should be a sub for actual crypto projects and technical discussions, instead of memes and shitty price predictions

@_date: 2017-09-22 22:46:39
is that the only requirement, or do some addresses that start with 3 are not segwit
@_date: 2019-09-20 21:01:18
Oh so looks like Bitpay and BTCpayserver are completely different things. It makes sense why Bitpay would require KYC since it also acts similar to an exchange.
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:05:51
Can someone explain to me why people need bitpay/btcpayserver? I still don't get it, why can't people just generate a normal btc address and recieve payments that way?

That's because you're supposed to invest it in an ICO, not bitcoin.
Best strategy is to pick the one with the best logo and name
