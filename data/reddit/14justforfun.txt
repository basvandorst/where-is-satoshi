How do I delete the wallet? I tried to "forget" it, but once I reconnected it didn't prompt me to enter my seed.

Got my trezor set up y'all :) 
@_date: 2019-03-02 10:20:09
I was hoping it would ��
@_date: 2019-02-24 09:30:26
I've been torn lately between liquidating all my alt coin holdings (except ETH and maaaybe ZEC) and converting to BTC, still deciding what to do haha ��
@_date: 2019-02-23 10:03:25
That's what I'm looking to do, thanks anyways haha I guess I'll just have to keep looking for a FAQ on their website! 
@_date: 2019-02-24 09:40:46
I just started buying after watching BTC for a year or so. Only up from here for me :) 
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:04:21
Will I be alerted of updates, or do I have to routinely check myself? 
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:17:55
I even closed some before I posted this lol 
@_date: 2019-02-24 09:12:00
In all fairness I've only used one (per suggestion from a friend who's been in crypto longer than I), but mycelium has been wonderful thus far. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 00:28:02
More time for me to accumulate �� 
Feels good having just bought in a month ago 
@_date: 2019-02-19 04:29:14
So I couldn't (or shouldn't, too?) Just copy the address and leave it on my website for people to send to? I should contact each person with a new address? 
@_date: 2019-02-21 09:46:06
How much does an ATM cost a guy? Lmao 
@_date: 2019-02-23 10:00:54
Thanks for the reply. I think I'm going to go with the ledger first since it's a bit cheaper! Can you use BTC to buy it?

I work in a warehouse and see the older barcodes daily. There can be half of the code scratched away and it'll still scan 
@_date: 2019-02-25 07:05:32
I'm actually online for one of these, nice 
@_date: 2019-02-17 05:30:44
That's awesome
@_date: 2019-02-23 09:57:39
Thanks for the reply. I'm a newbie myself so that's good to hear! Do you use a 24 word passphrase or is it just a numerical pin? 
@_date: 2019-02-03 08:03:28
Please no 
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:17:12
Haha, oops ��
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:02:05
Lmao 
@_date: 2019-02-23 11:01:02
But isn't trezor closed source itself? 
@_date: 2019-02-24 09:09:05
The first, and only time I've encountered it IRL was when I bought some BTC at one of those coinstar machines. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 00:28:22
I didn't get logged out.. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 04:24:57

@_date: 2019-01-19 19:58:16
It's annuda shoah 
@_date: 2019-01-17 19:49:08
Is there any where we can look up if one is near us? I have a few near me and would like to know if it'll work 
@_date: 2019-01-19 20:36:14
I don't, that's why I'm asking lol 
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:26:53

@_date: 2019-01-19 20:33:23
So pay $20 Everytime you want to rent a movie for $1? 
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:28:36
Doubt it. What do they do if you never return the movies?
