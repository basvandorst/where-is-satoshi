Good 4 U
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:22:01
Well your not wrong. But the main point of this post was to call out everyone who lost faith in Bitcoin over night and said things like" Bitcoin is dead'
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:30:02
I'm "hoping" it goes lower
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:52:59
Yeah I didn't realize how cruel I was being.
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:50:21
You sound like a lottery player
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:41:46
Ohh my gosh. You stalked my Reddit account.

What's that?
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:34:13
Debating what way bitcoin prices are going is like debating what tomorrows lottery numbers are.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:06:05

@_date: 2018-11-28 16:36:35
I haven't even made a statement on where I think Bitcoin is going.
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:50:31
That's what I like to hear
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:04:07
It's already dropped 82%. 
Is it really so had to believe it could drop to 90
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:39:50

@_date: 2018-11-29 22:14:21

@_date: 2018-11-30 00:24:26

@_date: 2018-11-28 23:32:23
Good 4 u
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:05:40

Bitcoin will rise again fall again rise and fall . I made this post because I think it's funny how many people lost all faith in Bitcoin overnight.
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:21:29
I stalked your account too. I find your current position in life to be interesting to say the least. Do you mind if I pm you some questions about financial advice.
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:31:55
