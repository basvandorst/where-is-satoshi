They all do.   There are hundreds if not more of them.  And why anyone would listen to a stranger on the internet let alone someone hiding behind accounts with no history or karma is beyond me.  
Now queue up the no-coiner, shit-coiner ass munch insults.
@_date: 2018-09-25 08:08:50
Why ?
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:24:08
And no one replied.  
@_date: 2018-09-11 03:44:58
With literally tens of people in attendance as well.   Bitcoin cruise?  WTF does that even mean?  I bet you could not buy your ticket with BTC or BCH.  But I did see you can use your Visa or MasterCard.... OK then.
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:54:07
So many of the accounts here are throwaways.  Why have conversations with people who do not want to expose who they are?
@_date: 2018-09-25 08:40:48
Why would you though?  Out of all the ways to obtain BTC why would you choose this?
@_date: 2018-09-04 08:54:26
I was so waiting for that.  How typical and such a parrot statement.  Check my post history if you like or actually ask me a question on the topic.  Bcash?  Now there is a real joke.  
And nothing I said was untrue.   LN is not ready and it’s not being used in production.  Man I swear if it’s not the memes it’s the BTC/BCH drama.   This sub has gone full retard.
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:03:00
I don’t think I had a point I was just being a smart ass.
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:01:19
It means LN is still a joke.
@_date: 2018-09-25 08:13:05
I disagree.  The common man who knows little about crypto and already has thoughts it’s a scam will feel scammed and tell others the same.  Not everyone sure.  But who says I gotta spend money to lose money in order to lose more money when I switch it back?
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:31:38

@_date: 2018-09-04 06:56:23
What festival did I miss?   Is wacka flacka on?
@_date: 2018-09-25 21:31:20
Right so it’s not good for adoption.  That was my argument.
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:52:00
Except the price.
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:36:45
Another expert?
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:36:26
I guess we should just listen to John McAfee then?  He was a guest speaker on the Big Bitcoin cruise.    LOL.
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:16:03
The face of change...
@_date: 2018-09-04 11:37:59
How do you do that when you’re in handcuffs?
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:14:42
Because nobody does.
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:27:59
This would require reading vs. meme making.  Doubtful you will find any future students here.
@_date: 2018-09-04 07:38:52
LN is not a currency.  It’s a still not ready for and no one is using second layer solution.  Joke was maybe a bit harsh.
@_date: 2018-09-23 19:35:03
Immigrants were blamed?
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:45:28
You did enough to comment apparently. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 08:57:56
No never said that.
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:54:26
So much time and energy wasted on this.
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:46:12
Definitely a very dangerous situation. One that I would never put myself in.
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:42:23
So it should just be a cheerleader show?  Rah! Rah! Rah!
@_date: 2018-05-19 08:23:51


And no one at a precious metals conference is trying to make it the next global currency.  Gold has not been the standard since 1925.
Why Not Go Back to the Gold Standard?
There are significant problems with tying currency to the gold supply:
* It doesn’t guarantee financial or economic stability.
* It’s costly and environmentally damaging to mine.
* The supply of gold is not fixed.
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:08:33
Guys....  What if today is the last day we ever see BTC at 7000? Lololol.  
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:31:06
Depends on that persons situation.  But agreed you have not lost anything (technically) until you sell.
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:02:08
Prepare for your ultimate ban.
@_date: 2018-08-21 04:07:39
Terrible thing to say and does not help him or anyone else in this community.
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:39:04
People here just talk about up and down, HODL and Moon.  That is way too technical of a question to ask.  :P
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:37:33
Thank you kind sir.  And I will do the disclaimer.  (I hold BTC).  But honestly when you surround yourself with ALL like minded people.  The whole lot becomes less intelligent.
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:14:45
Exactly.  The whole any alt-coin is a shit coin is ridiculous.  If you truly believe in the technology then having multiple successful crypto currencies and a healthy ecosystem as well as their underlying technologies and applications means the whole community evolves together and we are all better for it (Except BCH).   
The whole shit-coin mentality aside from obvious frauds is extremely childish and does nothing to push us all forward.
@_date: 2018-08-21 04:06:05
Lighting network.  Ready in 18 months x 18 months.  I really tired of hearing when it will be ready.  Show me something solid, quantifiable, anything.
@_date: 2018-05-19 08:19:12
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:10:59
Why would reply to an obvious shrill account?
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:58:07
So then how will we make it a global and border\-less currency if everyone is HODLing?
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:26:25
Dude.  Right on.
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:30:28
Yes but the intention is to build the base further and then hold or sell or a combo of the two.
@_date: 2018-05-19 05:34:40
Even more of a joke then?
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:56:05
Agreed.  So ducking childish.
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:51:44
Sure he has time to get it back together but the story remains the same.
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:09:41
I wonder who you work for.  Your post sounds like an infomercial.
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:08:24
When will layer 2 or 3 be live and in production?
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:10:04
Sure and I asked since I am curious.  I came to this sub seeking knowledge but generally I only get back shitty or abrasive responses.
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:36:40
Not all.  You are correct.
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:51:23
I think the reply above states my thoughts and feelings exactly. I want to see more information on how bitcoins blockchain is going to improve. I want to see solid information on why I should continue to invest. Not just be called a no-coiner which is false.  I’m tired of hearing about XYZ celebrity thinks ABC value will hit in 2020.  Oh and bitcoin Jesus.  And when moon?
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:32:28
You are correct.
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:44:43
Or an invisible dildo.
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:30:03
Being a community maybe?  One that informs each other and is not just part of a circle jerk.
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:03:33
What fantasy world?
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:42:51
That is a great example.  Thank you for that!
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:37:37
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:51:17
Totally.  And I am not knocking anyone Jewish but really?  Is that how you take down the institutions by selling the Star of David in the form of Bitcoin?  Holy "whatever"  I am going to diversify ASAP.
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:41:04
This guy and many others.  And agreed there will always be idiots.  
And maybe some people need a reminder.
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:42:15
*edit Spelling.
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:34:16
And you cannot clearly make that kind of statement without knowing my technical expertise or his in depth.  And I am more then open to explaining my level and background.  And not in any kind of penis size competition.  I see every opportunity to learn.  And when I am wrong?  That is the absolutely the best opportunity to learn.
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:37:27
That's called paying your way.  :\)
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:43:12
No answer huh?
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:45:47
But this was a BITCOIN conference?
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:43:25
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:02:22
Your address is public just like the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:55:39
Oh OK.  So you can't back it up then.  
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:28:58
I have two of them.  The Internet of Money I and II.  :)  And I will say he is very educated and highly technical.  Quite honestly I related to him in many ways.  At the end of the of day however he was a paid sponsor.
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:28:52
And this is not FUD.  This is all common sense.  Always invest wisely.  
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:45:15
@_date: 2018-05-19 08:03:28
Agreed 100&amp;   It is and will be amazing.  But BTC as a replacement for the USD today or tomorrow?  Not going to happen.  And there is no one who would give up 50 cents or \(0.000061\) BTC for a soda pop or cola \(depending on where you are from\)  :\)  Only to find out they just lost 10 or 20 bucks on a can of crap.
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:38:25
Then if you lose it all you are not f*cked. I would have to imagine it takes a lot to recover from losing a second mortgage on ones home or burning through student loans and losing it all.  I lost a small amount but nothing earth shattering and I considered it a great learning experience.  One that has educated me not only on BTC but the Crytpo world in general.  That and how to play the market by making smaller gains instead of holding on for the moon.  I'll disclaimer that by saying I'm sure I have been lucky in some cases.  But either way it would suck but not destroy my finances if I lost it all.
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:06:05
@_date: 2018-05-10 03:00:47
Kanye would disagree with you sir.
@_date: 2018-05-19 08:17:01
6 weeks eh?  GTFO.
@_date: 2018-05-19 08:25:45
If you could seen the people at the Musicbox in Chicago.  Ugh.
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:32:58
Riiiiiiiiiiight.  Then how will this become a global currency?
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:02:36
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:04:13
Paid speaker my apologies.
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:17:23
True but you have to drive the car on those dirt roads for awhile first.  Keeping them in the garage does nothing to push the movement further.  :P
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:07:09
Thanks much appreciated!
@_date: 2018-05-19 08:09:33
Is that not a red flag then?  The conference that is or will boost the price of BTC is powered by people who have no clue on how to use it?
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:40:59
I just saw him here in Chicago at the Musicbox.  And while he said some interesting things.  He also said a lot of nothing.  Well he did talk about the fall the American democracy and the usual "If you own the keys you don't own the Bitcoin" or something like that.  He was a paid sponsor along with the others doing a live Podcast.  I honestly do not know who they were.  A good friend invited me and paid for my ticket.  There was a live singer/guitar player who sang about the evil banks and the MAN.  And I saw a lot of hustlers there too the typical pony-tailed douches.  And this is my honest review of it all.  A bunch of people making bank off of people like us who are trying to just pull in a little profit.  Having said all of that I believe in Crypto-Currency but I have no faith in Andreas and those who make FAT FIAT off the little people.  
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:44:04
You tell me friend.
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:03:02
Do you have any examples to share?
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:43:02
No not the reason.
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:44:24
Can you site any sources for that?
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:40:12
Why can't anyone dare speak badly of BTC here?  It's ridiculous really.
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:07:03
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:59:25
How much did you pay and for what?  And let's make it real here.  What BTC address did you use so I can look it up with a Blockchain explorer.
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:07:16
It would be nice!
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:47:29
I am beginning to find this sub completely useless.  :(
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:06:51
What lies?  And sorry for the late response.  I was banned for speaking my mind.
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:41:59
And literally no one is using it.
@_date: 2018-10-04 06:52:30
Weird I read the birthing years started in 2000.  But now there are even sub generations.  I even read another site that skipped half of the already defined ones and lumped them all into baby boomers and X.
@_date: 2019-03-29 05:07:50
lol yup
@_date: 2018-10-04 06:13:38
Huh?  Lol.  
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:44:04
@_date: 2018-10-05 01:44:54
Ripoff 
@_date: 2018-06-04 03:39:21
Such perspective...
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:16:54
But when moon?  I was promised moon!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-02 01:50:43
Why is it a scam?
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:17:16
And Admins ban you.
@_date: 2018-07-13 04:27:09
When moon and moon when?
@_date: 2018-07-13 04:37:42
When moon and moon when?
@_date: 2018-07-13 05:27:33
So buy now?
@_date: 2018-07-20 05:39:19
But XYZ expert states it could moon soon!  Or it could go way down.  No matter what it’s gonna be Brotastic!
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:36:54
Roger that.
@_date: 2018-07-21 04:02:22
Does this make you feel better about yourself?
@_date: 2018-07-13 04:34:28
I just read a some Executive of a no name startup stated that Bitcoin might go up and it might go down based on his calculations that he is full of shit.    
But whatever happens he said it was going to be BROtastic!
