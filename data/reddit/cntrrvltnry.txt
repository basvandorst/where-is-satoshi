I'm by no means an expert in the situation, but this is what I'm seeing.  Segwit2x was a compromise between the users/some miners who wanted Segwit and the miners who wanted 2MB block sizes.  The users switched their nodes to BIP148 nodes to enforce Segwit while the miners signaled their support for Segwit2x.  The miners are now signaling Segwit, but the 2MB fork isn't planned to be adopted for 3 months.  Right now we effectively have Segwit with a normal 1MB block size.  If the users continue to enforce BIP148 on their nodes, then the chain will probably be split in 3 months when the 2MB blocks is supposed to take effect.  Depending on who goes down what path, his could be bad.  The BIP148 chain could lose a lot of miners, so transactions would take a very long time.  The Segwit2x chain could have a shitbucket of miners with no transactions to mine.  A consensus would eventually come out of the turmoil, but it could cause some damage to people's confidence in the currency.
Personally, I think we should honor Segwit2x.  It's a short term compromise, but it will keep the community together while we fix some of the issues in a less chaotic way.  Both will help a little with some scaling problems as well.  I think a lot of people talking about enforcing BIP148 after the Segwit2x fork are worried about the growing power of mining pools which is a legitimate concern.  I also think that there are ways to put some mining power into the hands of normal users and decentralize the process, but we shouldn't nuke the chain before the protocols exist.

I expect a pump and dump scheme.  Hash power will be directed to BCC to inflate the market for a short period.  The perpetrators will sell out and watch BCC crash while having gained a pretty penny from people thinking that the market is sustainable.  I'd say that the price of BTC will go down a little in the short term during a small period of uncertainty but will recover quickly.  I'll be dumping my BCC while buying some BTC.
Edit.  To add to this, the people causing this fork are playing with fire.  Creating this volatility is dangerous and could be a breach of trust if enough people fall for their ploy.  I don't think people are stupid enough to fall for it, but it does set up conditions that could destroy the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:05:10
I think it's about optics.  It's more believable to say that miners are upset with the contentious issue, Segwit, than a block size increase which they wanted.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:39:29
I think it's mostly artificial outrage that's designed to con people out of BTC.  I think some people saw opportunity in a fork, are upset that we're not getting a genuine one, and are now trying to force an artificial one.
I expect to see some hash power to go to BCC after the fork to inflate the market long enough to sell their BCC to suckers who think the market is sustainable.  I'm going to use the opportunity to unload my BCC, but I don't like this kind manipulation.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:54:16
I see you've been everywhere with a new account sowing this uncertainty.  I think most users and miners are content with Segwit2x, so I'm going to trust the emerging consensus.  I'll happily sell you my BCC when the split happens, though.
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:05:18
1.  Announce intention to split the blockchain
2.  Sow uncertainty in users (we're here)
   2a.  Convince some to buy new coin at bargain prices.  It totally has wide reaching support and will become the main branch of Bitcoin!
   2b.  Convince the majority that things are uncertain, and it's safer to hold onto the new coin.  This totally isn't to keep sell requests low.
3.  Split time!
4.  Redirect hashing power to new coin to make it look sustainable.
5.  Sell!  Sell!  Sell!
6.  Move hashing power back to main branch and make out like a bandit.
I really don't think the supposed outrage causing the split is genuine after seeing the support that the NYA received.  It looks manufactured (the brand new accounts shilling BCC doesn't help), so something fucky is going on.  It could be this, or it could be some initiative wrest the remaining power users have from them.  Either way, it's shit.

There's opportunity for some individuals to make serious cash if BCC sells for a small percentage of BTC value even for an extremely short amount of time.  It seems extraordinarily likely that certain individuals would try to take advantage of recent uncertainty in an unregulated market for their own benefit.

If you choose to use your currency for less than legal activities, then it's probably not the best idea to use an address that's easily tied to your PII.  Unfortunately, there aren't many easy solutions thanks to money laundering laws and whatnot.  The only thing I can think of is feeding cash into an ATM to a new wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:58:57
Wait, what?  You sound like a communist who wants to discuss things that he doesn't understand.
1.  Short answer, no.  you can google the long answer.
2.  Limited resources take work to extract the value from something with seemingly no value.  In the case of precious metals, it's the soil.  In the case of Bitcoin, it's transaction data.  People exhaust time and resources to extract the wealth and put it into circulation.
3.  Governments are incentivized to use fiat since they can spend recklessly.  Want that shiny new program or war?  Just devalue the currency a bit.  Also, an army would be useful to force people to use the currency, but I don't care whether you use it or not.  There are benefits to Bitcoin over fiat, but you do you.
4.  You sound bitter.  People accept Bitcoin because there are incentives to using it.  It's easier for centralized powers to exploit the citizens by manipulating currency.  Bitcoin is pretty decentralized.  There are are a lot of miners and a lot of nodes that keep track of transactions.  New currency also can't be introduced artificially and devalue your previous work.  'Equality' is a stupid buzzword for people who can't accept their own failures and wish to blame them on external forces imo.  You will be unequal to you your neighbor in wealth, intelligence, physique, etc from the cradle to the grave.

Supposedly, they're going to add a tag to transactions to ensure that BTC and BCC aren't transferred at the same time since the keys and addresses will be the same.  They're going to be using the Bitcoin ABC for the new client.  I'm hoping to find an exchange that I'll be able to dump my BCC, but I don't know of one right now.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:28:10
It is arbitrary because this isn't inflation.  BCC is not BTC.  The only way that BCC might impact the value BTC is through fud.

I'm watching you switch between outright shilling BCC by calling BTC 'Segwitcoin' in some threads and concern trolling in others like this one.  I'm at least clear on where I stand, and I won't suffer you and your ilk muddying the waters.

Your wallet doesn't contain any currency.  It's an address in the blockchain.  Anyone can look at every transaction made by your address but can't make changes to it.  To make a transaction, you sign it with your private key which is verified by your public key.  Coinbase handles keys where you don't have control over them.  I'm not the biggest fan of that.
I use Electrum.  Simple to set up.  It'll give you a 12 word seed (write it down on a piece of paper and keep it safe) that generates your wallet and keys.
Do whatever you feel comfortable with.  I don't know how things will play out either.

Use bank accounts instead of credit/debit.  Takes longer but lower fees.  Sell goods and services in BTC.

I'm running under the assumption that LEOs got the PII from subpoenaing the exchanges.  The exchanges could tie your PII to addresses, but it would extremely difficult for outside actors to get access to it.  I'm not happy with existing laws that force upstanding exchanges to keep the records, but expecting them to not comply with with laws of the land is being unrealistic.

Some people don't like a new software implementation that Bitcoin is enacting on 7/31 and are making their own currency based on Bitcoin that's called Bitcoin Cash (BCC).  If you have access to your keys, then you'll have the value in your wallet in both BTC and BCC, but Coinbase is not supporting the new currency.  If you want both currencies, then move your BTC to a wallet where you control your keys.  If you don't care about manufactured drama and just want BTC, then you're fine.  I always recommend having control of your keys, though.  It also might be possible to make a little money by trading BCC after the split.

I'd be more sympathetic if I didn't see you promote BCC at every opportunity.  In this instance, promoting doing nothing makes the exchanges more open to manipulation since it keeps sell requests low.
