I think the point of accumulating wealth is to not have to beg for help on a forum when you lose it all. 
Not overly jealous of that tbh.

Let us know how many people completely avoid using it. 
Like wtf WOULD you use it for?
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:06:55
This time we’re aware.  
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:00:03
Who cares?  If you couldn’t buy a fraction of one then you might have a point. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:27:36
That’s super. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:41:11
Except for us.

Right now his advice is dead on.

@_date: 2017-12-10 06:25:18
Why would you believe OP?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:13:00
That’s a fascinating concept.  Please explain yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:23:18
That was beautiful!
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:24:48
Was it?  I’d love to see stats about who’s selling.  Is it 10,000 new people, with fractions of BTC?   
Or whales with 1,000 btc transactions.

Use BitHumb.   
They have a 12million level signin process.  It’s seriously a pain in the area to log into, I doubt any user on it has been hacked. 
I had to get verified on it  to get a free coin awhile ago.

@_date: 2017-12-18 08:18:14
It’s all relative   
Compared to someone worth $500 million it’s not that great.  
Compared to common filth like us it’s mind numbingly high. 
And we, when compared to the poorest people in the world are almost unfathomably rich. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 11:52:43
Everyone is waiting for BTC to explode, who the fuck would pay bills with it?
@_date: 2018-08-07 08:22:04

I think the Weekend usually brings dips.  
And I think that Bcash will make another run at BTC.  Not to win, but to cause multiple buying and selling opportunities.  
I hope this is the case because I just watched in horror last weekend without benefiting from it.

Wow, very very nice.
Can you change the filter so I can show only exchanges?
I'm only want to monitor coins, say on Bitfinex
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:17:20
You mean if they’d travelled into the future first?
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:56:08

Hey that’s great!   Good luck.

A very small locker.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:38:55
I don't.  I put little faith into a place where my money can be lost due to a hack, in 5 mins.
The first exchange that's backed by a bank guarantee will rule them all.   Imagine paying $1 a month for such guarantee.    The banks would drown in money.

Just joking about how you didn’t appear to want money now.  I was implying you were like Scrooge McDuck rich.

Yeah. Sell it.  I just dropped it into OMG and QTUM with a little for XEM.   I’m looking at AEON with lust, it’s performed incredibly today. 
Anyone who thinks I’m a shill/Whale should realise the krill amount I’m investing.

Holy shit.  Did you read how much money he made?   
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:19:47
No, just you for making a stupid bait comment. 
No one hopes it will get rid of all cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:57:29
Be very interested to see how many people used it.

But you need to carry that around with you and protect from theft or failure. 
Think, online banking security but for Bitcoins.   Each wallet tied to your bank account.  Or one account per wallet. 
I wish I owned a bank.

That graph is based on the Bullshiticus model, it’s rarely used due to its incredible accuracy.

They will be bribed back to reality shortly.  They are pure corruption. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:59:15
Yes. Then a buy back of BTC either from:
Forked Money.  Or
BTC sold when it was high  Or
Alts that have artificially raised due to huge buying after fork.  
Some alts will continue to rise, BTC will stagnate till Btc Silver comes round in December.  
Then the cycle continues.  
Finally when no more forks on the horizon BTC will slowly climb unhindered.

Selectively editing that out makes no sense.   There are real drugs.  There is Bitcoin.  There are real life exploits.  
But there are no Agora clones???
@_date: 2016-07-14 11:43:20
And yet they completely ignored how easy it would have been to buy drugs from the deep web in the first season....
@_date: 2016-07-14 23:56:08
Really?  So why do they have tech consultants to make it as close to the real world as possible.
