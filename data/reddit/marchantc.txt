Exactly what i was thinking... He didn't mention 'taking over the world' once...

Might also be that btc price caused a lot of miners to shut down their S7s. And they were subsequently switched back on when they saw the new difficulty

Most people in SA use the local exchange. And tx is free if sent from Luno to Luno

I wanted to point a S9 there just to see. Keeps on putting me on the create a worker screen. Do you only support US and China atm? Even tried via US VPN.

From what i understand the HODL concept refers more to not selling your BTC when price is high. Spending and using them day to day is encouranged

Ha! Very new to bitcoin indeed... Bought some bitcoins and 4x S9s this week. Watching exchange rate like a hawk now ��

My take on this anticipated halving spike is that all the S7 miners that are supposed to be breaking even or even obsolete in some countries, are still running at the moment. Every one waiting/hoping for a bull to come and make their S7 profitable again. In a month or two or three they will see that it is not sustainable and switch them off. Only then will the supply drop and the price increase.
The up after the Nov 2012 halving also only came 4-5 months after the fact. 
Btw my S7s are also still running, for now.
