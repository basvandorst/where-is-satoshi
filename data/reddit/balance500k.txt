Sorry for your loss, man. I didn't get in crypto years ago and to be honest, I don't know what I'd do if I lost that much potential profit. Seeing your dreams collapse is a horrible feeling. Horrible. You die inside. But as some of above folks said, it's not all in fortune. Be happy with what you have and live in the "now" because your life is the most precious thing you could possibly have.

Dude... is it FUD if someone is waiting for his transaction to complete for 24 hours and posts it to a forum? I don't know what's up with the voting, though.

The website is misleading, as everyone sane enough can understand. "Pro core activists" insist that Bitcoin is now "store of value"... Well, folks, official site says otherwise. And by the way, everything stated on that website is wrong.

Most seem to forget that BTC was the one to be pumped, during to segwit 2x fork. People were buying BTC in hope that they will receive free B2x coins.
People are buying BCH because more and more businesses, exchanges etc. are accepting it, it's easy to switch to from BTC since it's the same blockchain, fees and transactions aren't comparable at all. BCH is seen as 5x times cheaper Bitcoin. Pretty much it.

Downvote as much as you want, that's how things are. Price indicates exactly nothing as people will stick to Bitcoin even if it wouldn't be transferable at all, because of emotions. I'm not on either side tbh, but Btc developers made this whole mess and I don't like where the whole market is now.

As the author says, "my view". Meaning that it's his approach to current situation. Although he made some nice points, I don't agree with his centralisation argument. BTC is way more centralized than BCH..
