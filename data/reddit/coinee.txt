Yeah, thats it... The average joe wont adapt or "get it" till mass adoption. Always late to the game or early to the game losing his ass trading, losing, blames bitcoin for his losses, and swears cash is king and would never use bitcoin.  Average joe has no vision, no patience, no balls. Merry Christmas average joe!

The Dells, Overstocks, and Expedias have done a great job of validating bitcoin, however we need bitcoin accepted for everyday transactions that include smaller price points, high volume business, and familiar territory such as as the fast food restaurants, grocery stores, coffee stops, gas stations. The consumer is then exposed everyday and is more comfortable spending $5-50...now velocity has increased with smaller sales and the rest is history! Buy local...buy w bitcoin
Explain to your friends or coworkers...wouldnt it be nice to go to lunch and scan a qr code which instantly transfers money from your wallet to the kitchen...no cashier, faster service, need a refill...scan voila...rid the world of servers and bad service and inaccurate orders and the awkward time consuming...where is the check, how are we going to split the check, my card wont work, how much tip, i need change, need separate checks...it makes me insane thinking about the obsolete pmt systems! The new dining experience that replaces servers and cashiers with runners that do nothing but execute orders fulfilled by bitcoin. The restaurant rids itself of needless labor, turns tables faster, and efficient cheap secure prompt financial transactions. The customer finally gets a dining experience w/o the stress of crap service! Everyone can relate to the above and bitcoin is a nobrainer for this situation and so many other everyday transactions. How much time do you waste each day to make financial transactions? Its absurd, but again the system is broke and to big to change with the pace of technology.

If we step back to the future of say when bitcoin was worth $13 and i was to say bitcoin was headed to $600...what kind of response would that have generated? Forget the $1300 high. I would have been crucified! Lawsky did not know how to spell 
b-i-t-c-o-i-n then.
You cannot undermine the potential of bitcoin when you combine the largest and smallest economies under one decentralized bitcoin even if bitcoin plays just a small percentage. This is a HUGE deal that is so disruptive that countries will ban it or try to regulate it until they understand it. I wish there was a reddit with the advent of the visa/mastercard in the '60s...bet there were some naysayers on there who would have been blasting some soul..."charge cards are going to have mkt caps in the billions"..here we sit w that same old crap card technology. Or...email could never replace the us postal service...that postal service that runs billions in deficit, but we need so people can get their ss check.

Meanwhile...5 hrs later Paypal announces bitcoin to be integrated w their app, but no future here...
@_date: 2014-08-26 22:09:40
This is just one factor that is taking bitcoin tech to the next level...to see the innovation just in the last 6 months...I cannot even begin to imagine where we will be in 1...2...3 yrs.
I look forward to the day of avoiding lines and merely scanning, texting everyday purchases at restaurants, gas station, etc...
@_date: 2014-09-01 18:22:15
Everyday use i.e. Restaurants is where mass adoption will happen...its great that the dells and overstocks have adopted bitcoin, but its the small everyday purchases that are a life changer. However, its a race now with the major credit cards on bitcoins heels...we shall see with Apple's announcement next week. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:23:52
I agree with you 100%. It's the everyday purchases that will enable mass adoption. I think NFC may be a key component until further tech moves things forward. Unfortunately...lots of growing pains until then, but Apple's announcement will be a positive for the industry as we move forward. It's not an easy sale persuading the average joe to adopt bitcoin and in addition wrapping his/her head around NFC...just look how long NFC has been around now and finally the big cc are just taking a look!
@_date: 2014-12-02 03:32:36
As i read somewhere today, Bitcoin has the potential to be as disruptive as the cell phone has been to tellecom. And yes, in the not so distant future if not already multitasking on our phones w apps applying tue blockchain in the background. 
I will be standing in line for the first phone, telecom, or app that can verify phone calls, throwing out telemarketing calls or charging them via bitcoin for answering their call. The same w email. 
The true way to bitcoin "mass adoption" is the blockchain! As the real applications present themselves, bitcoin will prove itself as a store of value and eventually a stable store of value that will be used to value and trade international commodities such as oil. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 03:16:34

I'm sure there already is. A combo of something you have (NFC ring and ur phone), something you know (pin  and a unique biometric feature...all 3 working together to complete the sale. In 5 yrs we are going to look back at what a joke usernames and passwords were...hopefully sooner than that!

However, like many, people love thier frequent flyer cards...that are increasingly worth nothing, but the airlines and cc love you playing their silly game. I went to a cash back card, but prefer bitcoin as a better form of store of value. Yes, im in it for the long term (years). Look at the bigger picture.

Well, it appears as NY has voted to NOT be the next bitcoin capital. So now, those residents/businesses can freely move their online wallet (or hide their paper wallets)to the next state, country, or business who is not going to follow in NY footsteps.

Meanwhile, I'm taking all the risks at $660, $510, and now $309... I'm not complaining when it goes down. I quietly buy more. Avg Joe better keep his fucking mouth shut when this goes up...

Guys, guys, guys...relax. Men in dark suits are not going to be showing up at ur house demanding your paper wallet! Im sure at some point Coinbase may be faced with disclosure. Im also certain that clients with disclosure concerns will create a new wallet and move to another service in a another state or country that has true anonymity. Its all supply and demand. This is not going to be a modern day Salem Witch Trials or chasing phantom terrorists. I think given time as the government learns more about bitcoin/tech, it wont really want to f$&amp;@ it up because it is here to stay and nearly impossible to control.

This is the exact feature of bitcoin that i am impatiently waiting for! The restaurant service experience is the example i always use in explaining the benefits of bitcoin. Bitcoin is a game changer for the owner and the customer. As a customer, i can get what i want when i want without being interrupted by a server or in the more likely scenario forgotten by the server. I dont have to sit there and wait for the check. Everytime i order...item is paid for and order is sent direcly to bar or kitchen while the money goes directly to restaurants wallet while at the same time automatically tracking inventory and ordering from purveyor.
Now the owner no longer is faced w fraud from employees, has lower merchant fees, increases business volume by removing slow wait staff, cuts employees from servers to more runners.
This same concept will apply to gas stations, grocery stores, home improvement stores. Imagine pulling up to gas pump and your phone ask you how much gas you want. You can just select "fill up" and push pmt... Done! Next u pull up to window at ur favorite coffee house and ur phone ask u if u want the same as yesterday and push pmt... Done! As you pull out...phone reminds u of dry cleaning across street..."do u wanna pay now?" Done...pull thru dirive thru and lady is hanging out window w ur cleaning. 
This businesses are the way to mass adoption... The ones we use everyday!
@_date: 2014-08-11 13:52:46
A national sales tax that would abolish the irs! I have been a huge proponent of this for years! Get rid of the loop holes...tax those drug dealers, tax the money launders, tax the off shore account holders! Every purchase (consumption) the merchant collects state sales and a national sales tax. Ooops...all the sudden we become a nation of savers...responsible human beings!
The real reason why the government is terrified of bitcoin...how are they gonna collect? However, the system is so broken (broke) now...they only collect such a small portion compared to what would be available thru a national sales tax.
Furthermore...imagine the gov collecting the rev almost instantaneously w bitcoin as each transaction is completed by the merchant...the technology is there!
People! We are talking about abolishing the most hated system in the world...the irs...getting rid of lawyers, accountants, ridiculous tax code, lobbyist! Leveling the playing field with taxes and a fair monetary system!

Wow, even these guys cannot rap their heads around what bitcoin is lil "b" or big "B". Makes me feel better when i try to explain it... and this is a huge problem. Its going to have to be really dumbed down. Furthermore, as bullish as i have not been impressed with the failures of what has turned out to be so many unscrupulous companies in the last couple of weeks. I was further offended by a recent interview w the 2 coinbase developers who are slouched on a couch in tshirts and holding millions of dollars in funds and oddly at this point bitcoins most reputable business. This may work for zuckerberg and social media, but if you are serious about your business and bitcoin is trying to earn the likes of mass adoption...you will not be taken seriously or trusted w people's money. That was a joke!just another example of why even these techies or anybody else is going to have a hard time explaining the antics behind b and B. the industry needs mature serious professionals to get things going.

I think it helps to give people ideas of how it can improve their daily lives. 
You go to a restaurant with your work. Each person uses their smart phone to scan the menu for their choice of beverage and food simultaneously completing the transaction w bitcoin and sending the order directly to the kitchen...cutting out the server who now is a runner saving you the customer time and your party the headache of splitting the bill 6 ways, waiting for the check, figuring the tip, processing the credit card, etc.. The restaurant turns tables faster and sales are higher because tables are not at the mercy of slow incompetent servers...u want another beer...scan another beer. Who knows how much this could save food and beverage in theft...always maintaining accurate inventory and accounting of instantaneous transactions.
There are so many examples everyday that people can relate to that slows down their lives as a result of lines or queues...al for pmt processing... W bitcoin...scan and go...scan and go...scan and go. Look at how much labor is wasted on employees at registers. From a business perspective...employees are a huge liability that make expensive mistakes...ironically most of these are lower skilled, less educated, minimum wage types in charge of the pmt processing
The technology is here folks, but educate people how it applies directly to their lives and how it makes it easier!

I do wonder if thats the same Joe i delt with at Flagship. Probably not. I just called and cancelled my merchant svc w Flagship... Nothing but a bunch of fast talking sleeze balls. I have more resect for lawyers, RE agents, and even bankers than these cheese dicks! My last statement...which is the one that sent me over the edge had a "misc fee: $92.00". They call their compliance fee a "misc fee". The statements for the most part require a lawyer and a team of expert witnesses to decipher the fees. As a merchant, i am sure i share the same opinion as other merchants... Merchant services are unscrupulous scumbags. To be honest, its not going to be easy in the near furture not accepting cards, but im over merchant svc tactics. My customers will be required to use Bitcoin, wire funds, cash, or send check.

Honestly, crypto is such a walled garden it will be difficult for money to flow into crypto (and i am one of the biggest fans of crypto). You have many banks constantly closing accts or threatening to close accts w kyc and aml and governments regulating or trying to regulate. now that im in the walled garden, im a bit concerned about getting out someday or at least til (if) regulators become more friendly. Fungibility is everything! God knows... This tech has to become easier to use. Im in the US and the biggest holders of wealth are the baby boomers and there is no way in my opinion my parents or friends are going to "head for the hills" with crypto. They are super interested though. Speaking of... I gotta go help my Mom w her new iphone and update. I got her a new iphone and ipad just so we do not have to consume our visits looking for passwords!

I'm surprised you did NOT mention cashing out via OTC trade vs. exchange for a large sum of crypto and avoiding exchanges all together. Honestly, I'm not sure who is a weaker link in the chain at the moment... the banks or the exchanges. I am so disappointed with both at this point.

So a good friend of mine who grew with is head of payment product for a large bank. I asked him last summer by the pool... What do you think of bitcoin, u guys working on anything? He didnt know what it was! I was completely blown away.  I told him a little bit and wasnt interested. Fast forwarda few months ago and i asked him. He knew a little bit about, but was mum. The same friend shares everything about his life. I didnt press him, but i think i knew more than any clue he had what so ever. 
I think these banks are so big it is really impossible for them to keep up with the tech so they just keep blazing the same trail mostly concerned w staying compliant. 
The 2 biggest problems w banks...
Compliance: its the law...they have no choice. Once bitcoin is regulated in one way or the other... Slow change will occur. 
To big to succeed: these institutions are so big and are as said above run by old school conservative bankers. Nobody wants a Superman. Not interested in any crazy disruptive change. There is no gold star, tropy, or ribbon for innovation. 
However, i am starting to believe these banks play an important role in mass adoption. It is vry likey bitcoin will play an important role in the background of bank ops eventually where the client has no more clue of whats happening than i do in all the code that is required for these websites.

U bet, anyone w a verified block chain identity (background check) or not if the consumer does not care about their safety is instantly a "ride share" for hire or free. The driver has their smart phone app alert them of ride share demand around them as they drive their way to work, airport, or another city. The client sends out bid, time, destination, and their verified blockchain criminal history via the smart app. This basic idea could work w so many other services creating a truly global decentralized econmy between 2 persons. Forget the middlemen!

Why is nobody talking about side chains??? I think Swift is a perfect example. They may need their own chain to test the waters and see what works, which as I understand why side chains would be enabled... Maintain the integrity of bitcoin and at the same time give the necessary open source freedom of innovation to all entities.

Ohhh the irony....ole Ben Lawsky may someday be revered as the Baby Jesus of Bitcoin if he actually keeps ones like Blythe in check. 
The question now is who will outsmart who?
bitcoin techies or wall street?

Yes, but you are not American. Our Government has a reputation for pissing every country off or pissing on them. Besides, we are very busy chasing the phantom infidel.
