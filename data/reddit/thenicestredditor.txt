Idk I didn't really see that announcement ill admit but in their recent announcement it sounded like they were calling it a glitch in the protocol which I took as the way their withdrawals are processed

So I guess the real question is who will the first person be to put a hit on MK?

Yeah like having my portfolio stolen by Mark Kerpopples :(

Do you know where I can buy vending machines in the us? Figured you might know :o
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:16:43
Me and a buddy are thinking of some regular snack machines (candy bars, ect.) or soda.  I haven't really looked into it a whole lot to be honest.. do you know of a link I can find some good resources on types of machines, regulations, permits, ect?
How do you go by setting them up, who do you usually approach for placement?
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:55:14
You're naive to think an exchange that was growing would go bankrupt that quickly.  They were making money off each trade.

Investment or gambling losses... bitcoin is still linked to other currencies
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:32:15
I didn't miss the point at all lol he said "if you lose Bitcoin you're retarded" how could that be interpreted any other way?  I cited two sources of people losing their bitcoins - one being Elon Musk.
Sure everyone loses some cash, but usually it's not an amount that you would be upset about losing, otherwise you're an idiot for carrying that around - same principle.  I've been a participant on r/bitcoin since 2013 and I can tell you that I've seen tons of posts about losing bitcoin or security flaws of bitcoin.  I mean c'mon you don't even know who created bitcoin - it's basically a MLM scheme.
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:26:28
Made this mistake storing my currency with good ol Mt Gox 
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:03:34
Nope but you can lose them forever pretty easily also crypto exchanges can spontaneously go bankrupt without being held accountable.  Not speaking from personal experience or anything :)
@_date: 2019-10-08 19:24:33
Yes, but as far as I'm aware you wouldn't walk around with heaps of cash in your pocket...
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:05:25
That was the point I was trying to get across from the original comment.  Yes, Bitcoin is in theory safer than cash but it really doesn't take that much to make a dumb decision.
I'm guilty of losing bitcoin myself, storing bitcoins in a safe way is hardly discussed on this sub - people just need to be mindful of risks.
@_date: 2019-10-14 19:58:54
So we meet again, Mt. Gox...
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:47:12
The fact that you have to use the word "retarded" so many times says all I need.  Bitcoin can't be FDIC insured.  Bitcoin can be lost or stolen, the security has come a long way but its not 100% safe.  You can literally lose your private key and never see it again, the encryption is actually a flaw in my opinion.
"If you lose Bitcoin, you're retarded" - say that to the 4 million bitcoins that are lost forever
[ 
Or arguably one of the smartest people in the world, Elon Musk  [ 
You're an absolute idiot if you have all your finances in cash/gold and not somewhere insured but sure let's argue about how bitcoin is so much safer than cash...

I had my password saved however it did make me change my password which sent me a verification email that was being a bitch but eventually worked.
@_date: 2015-07-11 17:43:26
When I changed my password it made me use a super secure one that was like 20 characters...
@_date: 2015-07-10 19:57:12
Yes, I filed without any problems... however I carefully documented my wallet as Mt. Gox was collapsing.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:39:01
Have you had anyone rent/purchase with bitcoin yet?  A 2M dollar loft in bitcoins...wow.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:53:21
who needs to advertise that shit? Sounds good to me already!
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:43:46
They could have a custom address. (I.G HiMomxhsuajyushf3819)
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:26:12
u wot m8?
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:20:57
Yeah the possibilities are pretty endless! It could eliminate dine and dashes too. You could also add a tip during payment.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:27:00
They wouldn't get their food if the transaction didn't go through :p
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:03:37
hahhaha that gif
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:32:29
Have it listed as a warning on the menu?
Edit: sorry bad answer.  Are people going to tape a qr code onto the laminated menu? Or just take an extreme amount of time creating a false menu that may or may not be used? I'd say they would find out pretty quick if an order wasnt going through. I suppose it'd be the restaurants responsibility to refund that order...?
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:17:52


It just doesn't have the same ring to it...
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:31:04
Hey if you're not 21, I'll take it ;)
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:52:32
Not to mention the douches who dont tip now are the ones that wont then.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:36:23
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:18:00
Isn't that a win?
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:47:19
I think this subreddit should have more of this kind of OC, the feedback and critique you guys have given have already improved those simple ideas!
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:54:12
Possibly even make the qr code on the menu to set up the transaction for the receipt? 
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:17:40
Now I'm not sure if that's a small banana or a big coin :(
Edit: Or a big coin and big banana or a small coin and a small banana 
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:35:06
Wtf? Is the next thing gonna be tipping neckbeards or something? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:34:07
If you look at the graph, once it starts getting close to that "bid wall" momentum picks up and it starts to roll, which is I guess where the talk about the price going and going and going is from.  Now it's over 950 so it has some validity to it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:59:10
I definitely do not trust that site...
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:56:11
Perhaps the paper qr style could still tabulate that like a tablet, but at a much lower cost (no need to spend money on tablets/electricity/ect)
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:32:19
But how do i get tipped!?
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:56:30
^ This guy's a good guy. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:27:44
I find it quite funny that he says the only way it will fail is if people don't spend Bitcoins...then refuses to spend any.
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:11:18
I hate to say this but this is exactly why people call bitcoin a ponzi scheme... you're not "baiting" them into anything, at least you shouldn't be.  You should be educating them on what bitcoin is and they can decide for themselves if there's enough opportunity to become involved.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:52:13
Someone would have a shit load of bitcoins by now (DPR Seized Coins)
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:22:14
HOW DO YOU HAVE SO MUCH MONEY TO THROW AT ME IF YOURE 14!?! ^but ^^thank ^^^you ^^^^so ^^^^^much

They can focus on more important things like refilling sodas and foods!
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:58:18
Uhh yeah, you could just send me the money and I'll give you the bitcoins. I swear. It'll work - no scam.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:56:04
Just sent 3k bitcoins to 1HNLMVcPcGd5ejWNM8QA1b4dbAninsQ1Ej you posted the wrong address.  Stop taking away Ross' justice!
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:24:48
Exactly!  I think chillis already has those but In all honesty it probably makes their job easier,  they'll get a tip regardless I'd hope! This would just be a cheap alternative to tablets
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:07:00
I'm sure you could set it up in a way that it compiles the totals and you could pay at the end?  Otherwise you could just order normally, but this could send your order right away!
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:45:31
I think so too.  The idea wouldn't be universal, that's for sure, but I think it would work wonders for late night restaurants like Denny's (where the idea occurred to me at 3am while possibly intoxicated.)
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:44:42
Whoa! You mamn/sir are a great (wo)man!  Nobody pays me in bitcoin:(

Upselling is mostly a tactic used in fast food chains.  The items on this "prototype" menu would be a complete entree. Hell there could be an "a la carte" section.
