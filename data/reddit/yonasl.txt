I can just say that in Spanish "Montoya" rimes with something else, a male anatomical feature that I believe all those Goxed feel like they are being taken up the a$$ with!

Of course not, somebody else has them now! Nothing gets lost unless you happen to throw your HD with private keys into a landfill.

Yeah, that's kind of what they were saying at the time. Not to mention buying **ALL* the *Newsweek* magazines can only be good for their bottom line. They will be making articles about Bitcoin for years!

Has everything to do. You deposit $$$ in MtGox you get a "service" in return. Regulation would have made it mandatory for MtGox to treat your BTC and $$$ as customer cash (therefore you cannot just spend it for instance to buy a new server). The legal framework is there,MtGox can declare bankruptcy and if you gave them $$$ you may be able to claim them back. You ask for an investigation and that is exactly what regulation does! Who do you think pays the SEC or the FCA in the UK (not that they are useful), the same firms being regulated. The rules they make also mean financial firms have to charge fees to pay for the extra work. Now, you may not like those fees as I agree they are way too high, and you may not like political intervention etc. but never stock or bonds or derivatives have got "lost" or Goxed. The only times money is lost and corruption happens is when you have an untraceable bearer bond or cash handouts (remember all those $$$ in Iraq and Afghanistan, they disappeared because, well they were cash bills easy to "misplace").

You wanted an unregulated, global, electronic, new financial instrument! Are you complaining now of the fact that you have an unregulated, global, electronic financial instrument?

That means paying them! Giving your hard earned BTC or $$$ to them and getting a Magazine you couldn't care less in return. Why don't you buy their competitor instead? Or the company giving them the most ads and having them stop. Now, that's a good plan!
