I paid $1,000 to transfer $5 /s
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:59:44
Technically the end would be $0.00 per Bitcoin I would doubt that would happen because I'll buy at $0.01

That sucks sounds like there was a lot of ways to avoid this though. Live and learn.

There was an article about a guy selling everything he owned to buy Bitcoin when it was $3000

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:36:09
Actually, most USD is not even backed by a paper copy. It's just digital, but not cryptographic. Think about that for awhile. It easier to hack USD held digitally in banks and the Federal reserve than a single bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-21 16:18:59
Everyday millions of USD is counterfeited by foreign governments like North Korea. Tether was able to blacklist the address but US isn't able to blacklist counterfeited currency. If anything this shows the resiliency of cryptocurrency over fiat currency.

It's the opposite of the FED printing 100Trillion USD per day and wondering why Bitcoin goes up compared to USD

The ETN is a registered financial product, a Bitcoin ETN relies on Bitcoins price, they moved Bitcoins price thereby manipulating the price of the ETN which is a registered financial product. Therefore they manipulated a registered financial product they then allowed to be brokered through them at a registered financial exchange (a foreign Nasdaq).

There are multiple rules broken and the complaint will likely have dozens but I'll start based on ones I know by memory. Rule 2111 brokered a product they deemed as a scam. Rule 2020 for ETN manipulation. And of course Section 9(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Comparing it with companies is fun but in my opinion it should be compared with other world currencies. This is an entirely different level than business valuations.
For instance there are $10Trillion USD and USD doesn't have atomic swaps and is centralized by an unwise and politically tainted Federal Reserve Board. I'd put BTC at about $20Trillion valuation.

Yes exactly. The ETN is a registered product! Some people think just because you use the word bitcoin everything in that sentence automatically becomes unregulated. Study books people!
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:41:48
 Calling something a scam and a fraud is a lot more serious than trash talking. Fraud is a legal word that would make an investment unsuitable for anyone to broker. They still do have defensive moves though. Jamie will say calling it a fraud was his educated opinion and not the opinion of his firm. In my educated opinion this was a serious financial crime because it held the same weight and impact.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:47:52
I'm ok with that now as I've made a profit no matter what. Bought in at when it was at 2k and took out original investment and left gains which is bittersweet but at least I guaranteed to never lose money if it crashes to zero

They didn't ONLY manipulate bitcoin. The ETN is a registered financial product, a Bitcoin ETN relies on Bitcoins price, they moved Bitcoins price thereby manipulating the price of the ETN which is a registered financial product. Therefore they manipulated a registered financial product they then allowed to be brokered through them at a registered financial exchange (a foreign Nasdaq).

@_date: 2017-10-27 15:27:35
Absolutely it completely changed things and was only 40 or so years ago, the next change will occur much faster due to technology.
History is the best indication that things aren't very solid for fiat. At any moment fiat could crumble. It is controlled by 2-4 of the most fickle human beings on the planet. Trump, Yellen, Putin or Un could collapse USD so fast it'd make your head spin.

Tell that the Venezuelans, Zimbabweans, Soviet Unioners, and the citizens of the over 3000 different state currencies which had failed in the blink of an eye throughout human history.
In fact you are lucky and a part of a very small group if your state currency has NOT failed in your lifetime. 
It's amazing with all the books and history on records we take something that is so fragile for granted.
