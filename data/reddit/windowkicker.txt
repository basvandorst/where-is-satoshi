Thats such misguided bullshit. He's using commodity USB hubs and 20 dollar cameras. This is wholly unfit to be relied upon in an automotive environment. Not to mention the graceful shutdown or emergency situations which he hasn't baked into his 2k lines of code. It's impressive for one man, as a single prototype but to bring it to market is at least 10 times as much work at very least. In a year teslas system may be many times more capable.

Currencies regularly reach an event horizon where they slip into hyperinflation unless they are backed by a precious metal. None of the modern currencies are backed by anything except the guns and tanks. The rare exceptions are the British pound which has been in operation for, I think, 300 years. All it takes is one sovereign currency to go into hyper inflation and for the citizens to run to Bitcoin to save their pension and savings money and Bitcoin immediately enters the world stage. Even a small nation doing this hugely increases Bitcoin's store of value price which will stabilize price fluctuations an awful lot which is what a lot of detractors point out is it's main downside.
@_date: 2015-12-19 04:00:24
I disagree. If you are saving transaction fees by an order or two of magnitude that's enough to expect of bitcoin. It was never designed for buying a cup of coffee. Altcoins are perfect for that.

He is correct because they those attributes are rounding errors compared to the systems already in place. The audience he is talking to is used to 10% transaction fee. 0.001% of a fee is a rounding error in comparison. They are also used to three days processing, 10 minutes transaction time is instantaneous when viewed in that context.

1. I see it being a store of value for the next three or so years and not necessarily for daily transactions. People have immediate needs to secure their pensions without the government taking it off them. The real drivers that will make the price change will be high value investors, to whom 200k is not much of a loss. Those people invest for long term.
2. International remittance. The traditional banking system are too resistant to change and the cartels will be ruined by workers who care losing even a penny of their hard earned cash to banks.
So all in all I see it being used for higher priced transactions more than small ones.

What attributes would a better digital currency have? There will be no such thing as a perfect digital currency because there are tradeoffs in terms of speed, scaleability and security. Bitcoin seems to offer the best of all these so far, and it's extensible, so unless there is something drastically better in all areas, bitcoin will most likely be around for a long time.

What happens if bitcoin undergoes order of magnitude changes (which has repeatedly happened in the past)? The confusion then far outweighs people inability to work in decimal points.

I'm open to correction but netfilter is the actual firewall and iptables administers it. The only other thing I can think of is something is being CPU bound by the extra processing the firewall is taking to process the packets.

I think people have heard so much in the media about bitcoin that they now figure it's time they invested effort into understanding what it is.

She has been charged but not convicted.
@_date: 2015-04-10 04:26:02


I never said she was a money launderer. She's an idiot for breaking the law.


Shes been charged, not sentenced. I don't make the rules but I also don't tempt the legal system by breaking them.


Yes, I do because it's extremely hard to avoid. It's mentioned on every visa card for every country you visit. The limit is 10k euro to cross the eurozone. She was carrying around 30 times that limit.

You would think this, it's something Warren Buffet preaches but people are more stupid than you realise and they seem to buy when the price is high and sell when it's low, the complete opposite to making a profit. 
My logic is the following- has ANYTHING changed to the protocol? No? Well no need to worry about short term price dips.
@_date: 2015-04-26 20:58:59
You are assuming that the current price is going to be the same price forever. If it undergoes 1000x it will be too late to cover your tracks.

1. Move the money to an offshore private bank. 
2. Start an offshore company somewhere like Panama.
3. Pay yourself as an employee of the company a reasonable salary as a "consultant" for online work.
4. Let the money stockpile giving you a health emergency fund.
5. Travel the world for a few years, knowing that you have savings to come home to.
You can't clear at the money easily. You might as well use it to enjoy life. I'd advice against buying sportscars or yachts. You can, however, charter or rent those things in a foreign country no body will really suspect you.

Use a port scanner from the outside to check if it's open on 8333 when netfilter is disabled and then again when netfilter is enabled, then you will have isolated you problem to your firewall configuration. Is SEL off?

From a stability perspective all bitcoin needs is a sovereign currency to go belly up and the citizens run to bitcoin to protect their pensions for the price to rise enough that volatility reduces to a negligible factor. I don't look forward to that day for the citizens of that country but its going to happen at some stage.
