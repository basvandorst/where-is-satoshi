sweet, just making sure that in the off chance electrum servers were down i can still move my BTC around.
thanks for your help!

i'm already doing this on my own through coinbase. the second i get paid i convert a portion of my discretionary income into bitcoin.

also, if i understand correctly...if my seed was "x" and i could generate "a" "b" "c" "infinity" public keys, knowing the extended public keys that are exposed after using a public address does not decrease the security of the electrum seed?  
you can have infinity extended public keys exposed but the security of the seed is still 128 bits?  
if that is the case, i find it fascinating that you can go from seed to public key infinity times, but not solve the randomness of the hash from infinity public keys back to the seed even if infinity public keys were all generated from the same 12 words...
if all the energy in the universe couldn't solve that problem it seems fuckin genius to me that satoshi dreamed this all up...props to the electrum developer too!

i read the whole article, and when i saw the word coinvalidation my first instinct was...fak you!

my concern exactly!  which makes me think i should make a new seed anytime i use an address to send BTC that is derived from the seed...unless, someone can confirm that you would need "x" amount of extended keys from used public keys derived from the seed before it is reasonably possible to use them and find every possible public/private key that can be generated from the seed...
unfortunately, i can't really read code, and just started to learn code (python) after getting into BTC...
for now i guess the easy solution is to make multiple seeds and just memorize the new seed after i send BTC from an electrum address..
i'd rather go through the inconvenience of generating new seeds for piece of mind...

i had this fear as well until i read about how bitcoin actually generates the public address from the private key...

great explanation actually, so if i want to learn cryptography what is the first book i should read? just so i can build a foundation of the basics and work my way up to more advanced concepts.

what resources can i read to learn more about the encryption used by bitcoin...it took me like a month to wrap my head around the blockchain and the difference between public/private keys...
i'd really like to understand the encryption and math behind it now...i've read that white paper but it is a bit over my head in all honesty.

awesome, thanks for the great explanation!!!

go on!
are you saying i can use electrum to broadcast a transaction from a paper wallet?  if so, how exactly do i do this?  can electrum watch a paper wallet without exposing the private key the same way it watches the deterministic addresses with the master public key?

just tested your site with a buy/sell/deposit/withrawal!!! wow!!! molah/prelude is like 1 billion trillion times better, faster and nicer than crapsty!!!

well, the power to tax is the power to destroy...
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:46:45
sorry i wasn't more clear, i know you can do an unsigned transaction with the master public key, use a usb and sign the transaction offline on an airgapped machine...
i was wondering if you can do an unsigned transaction from a paperwallet via electrum...if that makes any sense?

if gold/silver derivatives didn't exist the spot price would be much higher...
@_date: 2014-08-04 13:03:55
well doesn't the state exist to protect property rights?  
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:36:53
i'm with you, i think that the protection of property rights is the only legitimate function of the state...adding anything else gives the powers that be so much power that they are willing to kill for it.

ahh, i think i finally understand rainbow tables!!! i thought it was just a list of passwords, when it is actually a list of the hashes of specific words. right?

armory isn't a company either though and it's there.
