I see you're getting some non-answers that aren't really helpful and just give you more questions. A simple explanation would be that if you compare bitcoin to a dollar bill, each have limited numbers. There is a certain amount of dollar bills circulating our economy as well as there is a certain amount of bitcoin circulating. The US decides how much should be in circulation in accordance to inflation and produces more bills to maintain that level. They also do this because physical currency can be lost/destroyed. In the case of bitcoin it is indestructible digital currency and can only really be lost with someone losing a key to a wallet. Because bitcoin isn't driven politically there isn't any reason to produce more of them after the set amount is reached. We have nobody controlling it to meet their personal agenda through inflation. This is one aspect of a decentralized currency looks like as the value is similar to a commodity such as gold. Nobody can change its worth by producing it other than very small amounts being mined at a time. The price of gold, as with bitcoin, will run its course based on the people. In the end once all the bitcoin is sold/mined it will begin to find an equilibrium assuming it is adopted as a currency for transactions around the world.
Ps. (DISCLAIMER)  If this sounds like bull or if I'm completely wrong someone please correct me I'm sorry I'm just a senior in high school on a ton of adderall right now and I don't know how to stop typing this okay this is the end of my post thanks have a good day.

Honestly it's an understatement. The only movie I require seeing is Star Wars every winter now.

Thank you! I know what it means to be a psychological barrier it's just hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that it has such a strong grip on the trends. Fascinating.

Occasional movie, as well as considering it will only be supplemental to my job as I will maintain it in college and also having a meal plan that takes care of most meals. This is really only for eating out once per week MAYBE and a movie per few months.

Is this the commonly agreed reason for this or just your personal theory?

I appreciate that, if BTC does turn out the way this community believes it will then I'm sure I'll have second thoughts on mindless spending on small transactions.
