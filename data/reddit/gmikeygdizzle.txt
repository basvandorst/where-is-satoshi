I'm a relatively newcoiner. I sold that dip. Just got back in around 10k and added alts to my portfolio. Watching the psychology after that and that dip and the one to 5800 has gave me confidence and also considering that we are such a small percentage of global assets and there is only room to grow, theres no reason to freak out over dips.

And think about the next 4 years who’s about to get a disposable income: low attention span, juul addicted zoomers coming out of school with their STEM degrees. More crypto fanatics are on the way

I actually grew up in poverty, don’t be too quick to assume. I forgot r/bitcoin is a sensitive tone policed place.
