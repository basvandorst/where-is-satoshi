Sure you have a CPA advising you already but instead of selling the btc, paying tax on the huge gains, and then contributing the after tax profits, you should look into contributing the bitcoins directly in which case you'll not only be able to avoid cap gains tax, but can also take the charitable contribution on your  tax return.

Right but the recipients basis is a carryover basis so whatever the donor purchased them at. Only pays tax once he sells however.

1. Ok
2. I think one of the main incentives for the rich to invest in real estate development, stocks, other investments which generate jobs/a strengthened stock market/etc... is the fact that they don't have to pay 40% tax rate on this income like they do their salaried income. 
This is not a crypto discussion though so I'm out, I can see both sides of it.

That's because essentially all of his income is capital gains, and the secretary is probably all ordinary income. Are you suggesting they raise the cap gains rate to that of ordinary income? Let's just take away one of the biggest incentives of economic growth in our country...
Also that's not true any more. He's paying 24.8% cap gains rate and I bet her effective ordinary rate is around 20%.

And it was. To 20%, plus an additional 3.8% net investment income tax as well as another 1% Medicare tax on cap gains.
