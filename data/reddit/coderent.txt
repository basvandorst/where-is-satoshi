It's not being pessimist, it's being rational about the situation. They lose 65 million, remove 36% from everyone that wasn't effected by the hack and you expect them to retain a customer base large enough to make everyone whole in a reasonable amount of time? That doesn't even account for the possibility of lawsuits which are highly likely.

Don't worry guys, he's confident they've done the math so your money will be returned without issue. /s
How do you expect they'll return the 36% when their customers will be exiting in spectacular fashion? Sure some will stick around because folks don't seem to learn their lesson with exchanges but to cover a 65million USD loss isn't going to be easy without a customer base to collect fees from.

They doubt it, the evidence is right there. They told you they doubted it. Are you implying that he's lying about doubting his story? Trendon also went to great lengths to play innocent but makes no mention of [Mr. Shavers used about $220,000 in bitcoins and money from investors to cover his rent, car payments, groceries and other family expenses.](
He also makes mention of the price rising to above $1,200. He doesn't directly say things went to shit due to that but he certainly implied it. One of the hosts even sounds confused about why he was saying it and went on to clarify everything happened well before the price reached that amount. 
Does someone that's innocent neglect to mention what the courts have already told us? Would someone that's innocent try using misdirection about the price rising when it means fuck all to the situation? More importantly would they claim innocence in court only to plead guilty months later?
Also where is the 100k BTC transaction that took place twice according to Trendon(or anywhere near that size, mentioned at ~50minutes) on the blockchain? Find it and I'll eat my hat.

They don't have any legal basis for it, at least here in the US. Even if they somehow managed to convince users to stick with their platform after this mess they'll still be hard pressed to pay everyone back due to the legal fees this will surely incur.

BFX is doing the same thing without the obvious pretending. They don't have the same "luxury" as MtGox did in keeping it a secret. The BFX hack was noticed almost the instant the coins moved. They've created fake coins(tokens) for users to trade with. The only difference from goxcoins being the userbase knowns.
Somehow people are excited for this, along with being robbed of 36% of their holdings that were safe from the hack. Is it better than getting back 0%? Sure, but I don't see the need for the praise they're receiving. The whole situation is a joke. We'll see how many of those same people will still defend them when they're not paid back their 36% which is very likely.
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:50:40
I've never seen anyone so excited for goxcoins(BFX Tokens). Apparently all MtGox needed to do was tell everyone they're getting goxcoins instead actual BTC and they would have received praise left and right along with continuing to stay in business.

The payment must be seen by the network within 15 minutes, not confirmed.

What do you fail to understand about these people do not have the ability to make such agreements? If they could just agree to increase the blocksize on their own accord why was segwit stalled for months? **BECAUSE THEY CAN'T**. There must be consensus. It doesn't matter if every single Bitcoin Core dev wanted to increase the blocksize, unless the larger community wants it, it's not going to happen.
You are seriously confused about what a decentralized coin looks like. You seem to believe that the devs are solely responsible for changes that come to the network as they are in bcash. That's not decentralization, that's a centralized shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:21:34
Who is they? Where is the BIP that increases the block size that has consensus? This isn't centralized bcash, this is Bitcoin. There has to be consensus and there hasn't been a proposal that has gained such consensus.  
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:36:14
It's pretty clear you have no idea what you're talking about. No one that contributes to Bitcoin Core agreed to anything. The NYA was signed by very few people that primarily consisted of miners and businesses. None of whom were/are in a position to make such agreements because there wasn't consensus.
Segwit was activated because of the threat BIP148 posed to splitting the network. The 2x part was never going to happen and those involved knew it well ahead of the official announcement calling off the segwit2x fork.

I thought there was no way this could be legit so I tried it myself on an old S3.
Sure enough an internet connection is required or you're met with **"Error creating wallet: Network error"**.
I can't wait to see what sort of bullshit excuse is given for the reasoning why it's needed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:30:58
No trades for bcash are happening on GDAX currently. What you're seeing are the buy/sell orders that are pending. You'll know when trades have started and it'll be far from stable, or $4,300 for that matter.

Nothing he said in that video is outside the realm of possibility. I'm having a really hard time understanding what feels like a joke to you.
Do you believe what he said is untrue? If so you've not been paying attention.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:12:33
You understand that the same hashrate you're talking about hasn't ran the btc1 code base, right? They ran **CORE** with bip91 added. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:25:14
Exactly this. Backup your seed as you're supposed to. Unlike with an exchange you'll be in control of your private keys, allowing you to access those coins even if the hardware wallet is destroyed.

I've actually researched this rumor that he's playing up the act to gain views/attention. Do you know what I've found? Nothing. Random accusations from people on yahoo answers/forums/reddit but nothing with substance, such as your comments here. You should also refrain from calling people internet warriors as you're the epitome of internet warrior. Most of your comments here on reddit are belittling people because you disagree with them.

No it doesn't, and no it wouldn't. You understand that exchanges batching transactions means those are transactions going OUT of the exchange, right? Effective use of the blockchain is very important &amp; will increase over time. There will be far fewer transactions as Lightning picks up, does that mean less are using it as a currency? Not at all.
The bitcoin that users use for goods/services has to come from somewhere. Exchanges play a huge role in the current ecosystem &amp; until such a day that bitcoin is the sole currency of the world, they'll continue to play that role.
All you can surmise from that is more people are buying on exchanges. It could be new users, it could be users that are replacing what they've spent or just buying more for future purchases, and yes even some buying it as an investment due it to being very early in the life of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:12:41
Primarily due to batching, expect that number to drop once more exchanges start batching. A better metric is the number of  [outputs per transaction](

I don't care why he'd cancel the trade, or why he'd refuse to call the police. You're making excuses for your friend, are you in on the take? It doesn't matter if the money was stolen or not, it's not GG's place nor yours to determine that. He isn't going to provide the service so he should refund the money. Plain and simple. Why are you so fucking dense?
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:48:12
You're mistaking me for the OP. I am not. I don't care how believable the story is he gave. The transactions took place, GG refuses to supply the BTC for said transactions so he should return the money. I've traded plenty and I wouldn't put with someone stealing my money. You're both fools.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:00:43
I don't care about the either of you, however you claim you have his money and refuse to return it. That makes you a thief just as the OP describes. Why let the bullshit continue? Return his money and wash your hands of the mess.
Edit: OP if you're not blowing smoke and actually contacted a lawyer you now have proof he has your money and refuses to return it.  Should he attempt to edit his post, it's archived [here](
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:45:17
He'll partner with or say whatever in order to delay the activation of Segwit. BitcoinABC isn't a problem. Who do you know that will run it? They're free to fork off their altcoin with tons of hashing power and zero users.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:15:21
Did you read? "30 day rule is squashed". It doesn't matter how long it has been, he isn't supplying the service he offered in fact he's very open about holding the money because the OP said something that hurt his feelings. He should be returning the money if he has no plans to do business with OP.
Edit: Greenglobal has also mentioned not returning the money unless contacted by a lawyer or police. This shows he has zero intentions of returning the money unless OP takes some sort of legal action. That's theft.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:37:08
Jihan has never wanted Segwit, any quotes you can find on the matter that says otherwise are complete lies.
