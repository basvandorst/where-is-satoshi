Give the info to the Brits and have them "leak" it back to us.

They probably put the court papers in the same pile as the shipping labels. The "Do Later" pile.

No silly boy, you have a WHILE to wait.

Nah, just hack the NSA. I'm sure they already have it. /s

If he posted this setup on reddit... Everyone would have trashed all the wasted space and poor cable management. Several people would have also made fun of him for not just taking the $ he spent on his system and investing it in the coins.

It's not theft on the internet, it's **PIRACY!**

~~I'm guessing that this is your "receive" address since you posted it on here? Or can you load BTC on it like a prepaid ATM card?~~
Edit: After further reading on the site, I get that someone can't unload your card from the pic.

SShhhh!!!! That's how they make it **viral**

The scary part is, no. I don't know **anything** yet, but I also haven't talked to anyone who does.

I was so hoping that was a real site.

What do you suggest if people want to get involved, but don't have a lot of cash to jump in the deep end?

I'm starting to think you work for them. 
You - How many ways can I edit the add and get redditors to click on it?
Me - Dammit, I clicked it again. Oh well it was a little funny.

I wondered why my ETA for reaching my auto payout went up by a week.

I'm selling pre-orders for the Citadel. Order now to make sure you get your place in line.

Might be worth opening a new checking account. My bank allows multiple checking accounts but only 1 savings. 
Or if you were really paranoid (not always a bad thing) you could go open one in a different bank somewhere not tied to your other bank.

When this was first suggested to me the price was $115 ish per BTC. Its now in the $70s. I get the idea of long term investment for the sake of just making money. That may or may not work in the long run.
 Some of us want to get involved in the process. I also am using it as a project to learn how to do more with my Raspberry Pi and other learning experiences.
