I definitely understand an I know it can be hard. You can still post your podcast, but you do need to be a member if reddit, not just a podcast poster. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:08:45
How so?
I'm legitimately concerned for this subreddit. Mods are supposed to enforce reddit polocies, and the bitcoin mods are somewhat known for not doing that. I'm asking an honest question.
Did nobody see it? Was it approved? Why was it approved then? Etc..
@_date: 2014-04-07 04:22:04
0 BTC
We are shutting  down bitcointip and wanted to show people an alternative. 
If you don't want  to use changetip, no one is making you!
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:48:57
Bot shuts down. If you exported your wallet at any point in time, you're fine. If you didn't, we will probably through the abandoned coins into a tip fund. That said, we will hold on for  along time to make sure  coins are moved
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:46:37
This is a step. A big one, but just a step. It's very good  to see you guys dealing with this and working toward fixing it.
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:57:59
I don't make changetip! Just helping them with their subreddit.
@_date: 2014-04-21 03:08:13
Since when have you been an advocate for removing a y mind of content anyways? Your other mod removed that stuff (alright, mistakes happen) but none of them can handle the most basic of spam? :/
Not accusing you of anything, because pitchforks are dumb, but before you try and start moderating these comments, I think you could use a lot more work on the posts as well.
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:02:20
It's not my service, mate. I have no power over changetip
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:47:10
Or...or just maybe..it was instead removed for *breaking reddit-wide rules*
Stop being such a cynic
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:57:24
I know trust is low and thats unfortunate, yet understandable.
Hopefully changetip can speak for itself!
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:29:17
Yes, old nodes can still relay it.
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:54:21
Sounds good to me! We just hope to attract a better userbase, and have more transparency!
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:49:15
This doesn't seem to really have anything to do with bitcoin actually.

Then post all the articles you want

Click that "Get Bitcoin Wallet" To link your account to blockchain.info so you can withdraw any amount with the fee you set.
@_date: 2014-01-11 04:11:31
Reddit is not a site you should be promoting yourself on. Al of your recent submissions are from the same domain and this is *not* acceptable under reddit's rules. 
You should read reddit
 FAQ and the self promotion guide before your account gets shadowbanned for spam. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:27:28
From a reddit standpoint, users spam by over posting links to certain sites that they may have a potential to gain a profit from, or "self promotion"
I can link to my website, sure. But if all I post is links to my website, which contains ads, I'm a spammer 
Check out the link in the bottom of that post to see me finding spammers in users, which is the big deal, not domains. 
Spam is also considered "self promotion"
If I have a blog that I may not make money on, but it's all I ever post, I am by definition a spammer. 
I moderate and do spammers post pics? Yes. That does not mean they are not spammers. 
In general, reddit's rule is the "10% rule"
If over 10% of your submissions go to websites you are affiliated with (or the same website, for that matter, affiliation doesn't matter too much) then you are a spammer. 
Now if course, there are exceptions. If you participate in reddit, as in commenting in threads outside your own and occasionally post content outside what you usually do, no one really minds. 
While you are free to do what you wan on your forums, this is reddit and you do have to meet the bare minimum. I'd honestly suggest getting some more mods who know what they are doing, or possibly working with mods on revising your policies on spam. Of course, I'm just one person and you don't need to listen to me. 
One of your mods told me something along the lines of "it's hard to see if something is spam in just the context of a post"
Well..that's why it's your job to look into the context! I'm not asking for perfection, I'm asking for effort. It sucks to see a subreddit go down like this with blog spam everywhere. 
Edit: as for votes, sure, you've got a point. Voting hides the low effort content and keeps a subreddit in check, but votes alone does not a subreddit make. Spam still exists. It's not too hard to change things to at least *improve slightly*
This all said, I'm just a guy, and it's up to you what you and your team want to do. I guess I'm just ashamed. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:22:24
How what?
@_date: 2014-04-19 13:59:56
Who is paying people to troll? For real. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:03:33
I believe it would be possible,  but that isn't something we will be doing :)
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:51:17

@_date: 2014-03-03 14:47:50

Thank you, Gavin.

That's what I meant when I said the password is safe. My bad. Should have worded that better!
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:36:34
My last title was bad, so resubmitted! Feel free to toss any questions my way!
Thanks all of you for making bitcointip awesome!
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:28:47
In general, people ignored bitcointip a lot too. Only those who were at least faintly aware of bitcoin ever respond to tips, and changetip makes it obvious enough that bitcoin is being exchanged, I believe.
But yes, you do have a point, and you should bring it to $0.75
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:26:12
1 dolla Bill y'all
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:40:07
How did bitcointip mess up its reputation?
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:51:50
We do not allow stuff like this, but thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-03 17:59:32
Unfortunate downside:
Someone would probably get banned. Admins are very finicky about bots, and if someone intended to call for bitcointip and changetip responded, that could be reported to the admins and could get the bot shut down. Its already been a problem for changetip in a different issue, making unsolicited PM's
The better idea probably be to make a bot that scans for "bitcointip" and just drops a comment letting them know that its closing or something like that.
In any case, I like the idea of changetip listening to bitcointip, but we would definitely need to get admin approval first.
Ninja edit: Or, once bitcointip is shutdown, it should be fine to use its name now that i think about it. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:32:25
Yes. Because a apple lawyer would be a mod of riiiight.
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:25:08
Yes! You have until June to move your tips anywhere!
@_date: 2014-03-22 13:43:55
Honestly, yes.
Post that you need to contact KRAKEN ASAP.
At this point though, the damage could already be done.
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:51:20
Bitcointip doesn't have any fine print?
I think you mean changetip
@_date: 2014-04-07 04:20:15

@_date: 2014-04-16 03:35:05
How is it not moderating? They are removing topics they see unfit. I never said it was good moderation, but it is moderation  Andi personally don't see anything wrong with it. It is their choice as moderators to moderate the content that they want to moderate.
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:52:09
@_date: 2014-04-07 04:29:43
Thanks for posting this! Important people know what they are signing up for.
I'd personally like to say that no one is replacing anything. NFS and I decided to close down bitcointip, and changetip is an alternative to the services we provide. 
Other bots include which operates in a similar fashion  to bitcointip, so you may be interested in that.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:46:25
Well, you have two options here:
A. Be a white hat and report it to btc-e
B. Don't be a white hat, **post proof** then do what you want.
B isn't an option unless you have proof, and A is generally considered the best option.
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:41:09
Read up a bit more! Changetip is far better in lots of ways!
@_date: 2014-04-07 04:19:17
Changetip didnt pay anyone off.
This isn't about endorsing changetip as much as it is shutting  down bitcointip and showing users an alternative to it. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:56:03

@_date: 2014-05-29 02:50:48

@_date: 2014-03-03 14:29:12
If you ever see this, toss a message to the mods! I sent them a message and they got it
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:46:34
This is not what happened
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:27:28
That's not what moderation on reddit is about at all. Maybe in other sites, but here,  mods are allowed to do this on their subs. They make the community and have the choice to remove or approve what they want. It's  so easy to just create a new subreddit
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:33:38
Fixed  
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:29:03
I think this thread is fine. People will complain no mater what mate!
Changetip is a good service and I would recommend it! My title may have been  abit iffy but I think it's alright.

@_date: 2014-02-06 16:46:08
It was a violation of reddit rules. The mods wouldn't remove it, so the admins did.
Just like many of the mods don't remove spam here, I've had to bring it up to admins sometimes,to get spam removed.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:44:44

These guys are cool.  $0.25 :)

That's pretty selfish of you.
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:20:23
I think you are over-estimating how many people use the bot.
Currently deleted non-exported accounts had less than half a btc in it.

@_date: 2014-04-16 03:43:51


They see. It's what they believe.
When have they said they don't like bitcoin technology? Maybe they were tired of bitcoin posts being over saturated? Every little tiny thing about bitcoin being posted always? Don't jump to conclusions so hard.

@_date: 2014-04-17 15:06:34
NFS is not on the dev team of changetip I believe. He does use it, however.
Bitcointip *automatic* web wallet creation is with BCI. If you want to use a different web wallet, you'll need to use the withdraw method.
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:16:37
That is fair enough, and I understand a bit better now :)
I think either way, Changetip will do lots of good, perhaps more than bitcointip ever did

Too much?

While tipping has always helped spread bitcoin, I feel that's a very selfish reason to not like changetip.

And they are leagally required to notify you if it does change. So you can then read it and get the fuck out of there if you don't like it.

Moderator of:

I perfectly understand how moderation works. Hiw most mods treat their subreddits, and more.
I mash the report button here more than most, usually. I am an extremely dedicated submitter to as well.
What i mean is things like users shadowbanned for spamming getting approved, reports actively getting approved. Mods not taking half a seco d to click a username and easily see the spam.
All mods have dofferent styles, and the mods here are simply notably lax, and it frustrates me a bit.
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:30:00
But it is. If they see "Bitcoin" as unfit, then they are removing it..that's moderation..exactly what you said it was.
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:50:54

mmmm spam
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:02:48
Here is a section from a recent message.
The spam has been getting better, I will admit that.
The biggest problem I see is posts getting approved by shadowbanned users.
lets take a look at
  famous for spamming reddit.
 --all posts approved . 
 --look at the submission history
 --banned
 -banned
 --banned
 --banned
 --banned
take a lok at this domain: 
THERES SO MUCH MORE TOO
 --oh wow look at that.
All of this is found from the last 4 hours in *[At the time of writing this a few days ago]
none removed. none even looked into.
I personally have been going through your new queue and making RTS reports, trying to fight the spam that has been allowed.
I don't want to go and say bad shit. You guys do a good job for all the traffic this sub gets. 
There is just still a lot of problems that need to be solved. I'm sure most spam is in fact removed..but some spam is still spam, and there is plenty of it.
edit: Finding spam right now, see 
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:55:38
Dropping in on this thread.
I know that you personally are a pretty laid back moderator, but do you plan on handling the spam problem any time soon? Is it a matter of not enough mods, or perhaps a misunderstanding?
I have been looking into recently and the spam levels are out of control. Not only is the spam present, but it is actually being approved! It's not being removed!
I'm getting a bit concerned. I have communicated with others and even admins of reddit.com about the spam problem here, and trust me, it exists.
What is your plan on this?
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:10:02
I think that goes a bit far. I think it was pretty dumb, but it's still fixable. All it really did was violate my own trust a bit
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:43:01

@_date: 2014-02-15 17:50:02

No, bitcointip is not connected directly with any other bot.

@_date: 2014-01-14 13:41:52
And, If I may, let me remind you of *Reddit-Wide rules that you as mods are supposed to enforce*




as well as general spam guidelines set by reddit:




However, this is your subreddit and you are free to use your own judgement. But you still have to enforce the rules somehow.

Hey guys. I'm a mod over at We have worked a bit with the guys at changetip, and, one day, we plan on passing the torch to them. 
Not only can you tip on reddit, but also on github and Twitter, with more plans to expand soon.
If you like tipping bitcoins, check them out.
Edit: I'd be happy to demonstrate the bot to anyone. 
Also, the site and bot are still new. We are working out some kinks. Subscribe to to stay updated
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:34:48
No, they haven't :)

Yes payouts are very low but for some people some is better than none. And I'll look some stuff up
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:54:55
Decentralized means that no one controls it! The US dollar is controlled by the federal government. The money in your bank is controlled by your bank.
With bitcoin, there is no "mint". With bitcoin, no one has control over your money. No governemnt can make more of it! It is yours and yours only!
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:50:08
Yes. When people use the service to get all generous, it makes us happy :) 
Im very glad it exists. It's why I made the twitter for it. :3
Brings people together too. With the ability to type just a few charecters and make someone's day great, it makes everyone feel great really. 
I'm probably making no sense, as its almost midnight and I'm dead tired, but seriously, you're cool. 
You should check out if you are ever feeling this generous again.

iOS is a bad game for developers right now. Apple has smashed down a hammer on bitcoin related apps, and barely anything gets through. Blockchain.info amazingly got their app through, but only recently. 
As someone who uses bitcoin almost completely mobile, it really disappoints me. There is so much I could do, yet so much I can't. 
I'm very limited with what I can do with what my device can do. Even Cydia is seriously lacking in yummy bitcoin stuff. Is sad. 
There has recently been a new app that lets you mine litecoins. Possibly the first step in a right direction to get some of these reliable good apps back. (Of course that app doesn't work though, can't download even though I meet sys requirements)

We get these types of posts in all the time. Most of the time I just remove them and comment something along these lines. The original idea is great, really is, but the way of doing it is just flawed. 
We can't "win over" reddit by spamming it. The hive mind will not look kindly upon that. 
However you can still always bring attention to it. Tip in a popular post, mention bitcointip when you feel like  it. 
To be clichéd, "act natural", don't try and force it.

Alright. There is one thing that actually angered me about this.


I'm alright with this guy to have his opinions and arguments and blah blah blah.
But I find it downright *rude* that someone is telling me what I am *so obviously* doing.
I totally *bought bitcoins* (I didn't) so I could *make a profit* by *selling them off!* (I am not selling mine off. Nor will I ever.)
Do some people do that? Yes. But there is absolutely *no fucking reason* to generalize a group like that. It's like calling every bitcoiner an anarchist (I'm not).
I have earned or mined every single bitcoin I have ever had. I'm not selling any Bitcoin anytime soon. 
So no. Please don't tell me what ***I am doing*** in your critical article on Bitcoin. Please instead discuss things that can actually be discussed.
It's rude and bad writing. 
That is my issue with the article.

I think the biggest confusion for you is the public/private key thing.
Using very complex math, you can generate a private key.
This private key can have some math done on it to give you an address. 
However, the math is so utterly complex, that there is *no possible way* to reverse it. You can't get a private key from an address.
A program simply generates a private key for you using some random numbers, and your address is just the private key with some complex math done on it.
Each and every key must be generated. There isnt some huge database of private key/address combos. It's all math.

Talk to me about the issues I actually brought up.
Specifically, the ones about approving posts made by shadowbanned users, who were banned for spamming.
I would simply like to know why this is alright for you guys. 
Doing stuff like that can result in a ban of a subreddit, since it is up to mods to stop spam (and you guys are, in a way, approving it)
I'm simply concerned for the subreddit. If you do need help on the spam side, there are lots who know what they are doing (not that you don't)  and will help!

Then remove their link, tell them there is a problem with their account, and direct them to the admins, so they can learn and get unbanned. They can then post without issue.
Also, if that same user posted a link to  , chances are it's spam anyways.
Like I said, I am simply concerned. I am seeing spam that should be removed, but isn't.
ninja edit: if that user posts an image to imgur.com, and it all seems fine, then go ahead and approve it. I totally understand that. I'm more concerned about *spam* that is getting approved.

If you want bitcoin without buying, faucets can add up pretty quickly if you use them right. As well as sites that do hourly or daily bitcoins. Etc...takes a while but I've gotten at lease a few bucks from those types of sites.

@_date: 2013-04-04 21:10:43
I'm sure it can be negotiated. Tweet  or PM him. Enough demand might get it lowered
The issue right now is the it's barely keeping up with what it has to deal with now, and if comments come in faster then the bit can process, well the bot can't process it. 
$50 is too much, but I would advise keeping the donation minimum somewhat high. Maybe 15-20.

@_date: 2013-04-24 22:53:30
Well, there isn't really a screenshot of how it all works but I can summarize 
1. Tipper comments as a reply to a comment or post, or sends a message to the bot. For the sake of this example lets say a comment. 
2. Bot is active and scanning through the API. It finds the activator, the +tip
3. It reads the data and checks its validity with the sendin user, checking balance. If balance is correct, the bot creates a transaction and signs it with the senders private key. 
4. The bot creates a message to notify the user, and possibly make a comment if the verify command was used. The bot then sends this message through reddit API's
5. The tippie mus accept the tip. If he/she does not, the bot makes another transaction and sends the coins back. 
That's really it. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:20:21

The "network" is peer to peer. And runs a protocol. When you download the blockchain, you open the port, and the protocol connects to peers.
Basically, you download it from everyone :) 
The same idea behind bittorrent. It opens it's ports and connects to other people, who are connected to other people, connected to others, etc..

You may also be able to click [This]( but it doesn't work for everyone.
The "Fetch Wallet Address" Isn't quite working right either! If you want to have your balance next to your username [like this]( then do the following:
1. Navigate to the bitcointip settings page
2. Scroll to the bottom
3. Click "Add Address"
4. Under "name", put your own reddit name
5. Put your Deposit Address as the address.
6. Scroll up and "Save Options"
7. Reload
8. Profit.
There you go!

I'll let them know in IRC. Once again, I am sorry if I came off as aggressive. I simply don't like spam :) after modding a lot of subreddits for a while, it is definitely possible that my trigger finger got a bit itchy and I am in the wrong here. Still, it never hurts to send a report just in case. 
On an slightly related note, do keep an eye out for "actual" spammers. Spam is a big problem in right now.

Blockchain.info is the most secure of online wallets. 
While Offline Clients are much safer, bc.info is fairly alright. 
You may get scared around here by all the online wallet hacks and everybody screaming about using an offline wallet and they have their reasons for it. 
Like any way of storing money, every system has risk. Offline clients have a much smaller risk. Blockchain.info is fairly secure, but there is a risk. Risk putting money into your bank, burying gold in your backyard, using an offline wallet even. 
While I highly recommend offline wallets, don be so freaked out. As long you understand that there is risk then you should be okay. 
Bc.info also has extra security like 2 factor auth and IP restricting. 
The only exception is over 25 coins in my mind. Then your risk is even higher. 
You should worry about where your money is. Doesn't mean it's the wrong place. 
Edit: added more.

Spam isn't by mistake. 
A single post may look fine, but people don't just get shadowbanned "for lulz"
I understand *the way of things*, but the fact is, many aren't following that, when blatant spam is approve. 
It may be hard to see from just one post, but in general, non standard links by shadowbanned users should not be approved.
Self posts or image posts or something would most likely be fine.
just my 2 cents. I don't want to see this subreddit banned.
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:29:57
I still think the HTML code should be removed. It doesn't really make a lot of sense.

Well the number is how much people meant to tip at the time. It wouldn't make a lot of sense to adjust the numbers. When half a bitcoin was 5, the person tipping was only really giving 5 dollars.

Hiya. 
We are having some trouble as of late. A ton of new people are opening accounts and messaging the bit and usin our services.

1. Just be very, very careful. If you can, don't make a brainwallet and just generate one, and print 2-3 copies and keep them in multiple safe place.
When/if you want to use it, withdraw the entire amount into a new address, spend what you want to, then make a new paper wallet and deposit what you want into. 
Never add more to the wallet, make a new one if you want to add to it.

I don't think you quite understand how this system of cryptography works.
Nothing *actually* exists.
As long as your RNG is secure, you get a very secure mathmatical function (kinda) that lets you create valid transactions.
Its not like the program gives you the password. The program creates it all.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:39:58
As an example, I have 3 main addresses.
I have 1FoxPshYdk3DWhU1ArZvNrFYgtwNxDXyAs , as my personal address, mostly savings. I don't use it much.
1K7xZrzS41f9RNgRNnjttCKPNCAJk9BU5s is my main address and my bitcointip wallet.
I also have another one, for my tablet, and a cold storage one.
It helps me organize

Why would you store coins in bitcointip that you can't afford to lose? What's stopping coinbase from doing the same thing?
