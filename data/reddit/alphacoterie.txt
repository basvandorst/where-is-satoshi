I'm a little out of the loop. Can someone ELI5?
@_date: 2014-12-30 09:10:09
Not bad at all. However, I was just gonna tip him bits, not actually buy a painting. Your mother has great talent! ;D

Not really. (amount picture sucks)/(how generous I'm feeling)*(4+7)*c = bits you get.

I will pay you in bitcoins to paint a picture.

If this happens Bitcoin would be truly unstoppable. I buy through Amazon more than any other online retailer, and I spend more there than I do through physical shops. I would switch completely to Bitcoin in a heartbeat just for Amazon.

I remember your thread. I'm curious, what are you going to spend it on? Will you just tip, or are you going to try to buy things with it? 
@_date: 2014-08-10 06:08:22
Sorry to say this, but I always act surprised when I see tap-to-pay. It's cool, yes, and I use it myself, but I only do that because they might tip more.

I wanna let you know that you're probably successful. I got in through a reddit tip as well. :D  
OK, yeah it was on I was already curious. But I definitely wouldn't have bought any myself if it weren't for that tip.

I'm with you on that. I just want to pay for everything in my daily life with bitcoin, just as I do with cards or cash today.

Hey, could you suggest some alternatives? Are there better prices? I only use Coinbase for now, and I've run into zero problems, but I'd like some more options. I'm only a noobling Bitcoin user.
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:04:01
Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:41:28
But what about when Bitcoin picks up in Thailand?
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:56:15
That's like saying the krona or ringgit will go obsolete just because they're foreign currencies that you'll probably never use. You'd be surprised how many use the baht even outside of Thailand.
@_date: 2014-07-12 14:22:28
Hmm, ok.

It's a large, popular subreddit. It just gives a sense of scale. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 10:21:49
Read the comments above. In this thread alone people have tipped him 8 USD.
@_date: 2014-01-23 06:53:09
+bitcointip $0.02
@_date: 2014-01-23 15:34:22

Damn, son. That's so metal.

If this is fake, we have a thread full of advice for any future troubles. If not, then we might have actually helped someone. Giving evidence is great, but in this case I believe it doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 11:50:03
I know, but that's what I've just noticed that kind of statement means from any kind of business or organization. Also, yes, donations would be absurd.
@_date: 2015-01-12 10:59:39
“We're building our company and hoping we hit it big so that we can charge/offer premium services/use ads/accept donations in the future.” is basically what he said.

Hah, I saw captainlegendary's code and tipped him for fun, never thought someone could actually mistake it.

I've never understood how the simple act of opening an email can do anything to you. As long as you don't click anything within the email, you should be fine, right?

My phone is always locked, and I use Avast security to lock that app with a PIN. Do you think I should use another app, or give up on apps entirely?  
I backed up my private keys from within the app. It's at the very bottom of the page. Unfortunately, I don't think it was encrypted, since I took the file from my phone and opened it with a regular text editor.

Thanks, less scared now. I always Google the address and subject of a strange email to see if it's a known virus/scam. Don't think I'll ever stop that practice.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:13:51
I was asked for a password before backing up or accessing my private keys.  
Thanks for your advice, I'll look into those encrypting programs now.  
I have no bitcoins in this wallet anymore, so I'm not too worried about security now. I'll be much safer in the future.
