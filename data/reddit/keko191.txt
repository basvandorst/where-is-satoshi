I'm looking to make $0.2-$0.5 profit per $20 card.

HAHA U SHUD DO STAND UP
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:59:19
I guess you need to gather a petition of people who would like to see Bitcoins integrated. You'd most likely have to contact the smaller businesses first then work your way up.

Unfortunately I don't have $5,000 laying around. Thanks for the link though!
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:04:18

Would you trust them enough to buy £500 worth of gift cards off them?
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:18:18
Oh sweet, is there any guarantee you're legit?
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:48:58
Congrats buddy, in a way you're lucky for forgetting your password for so long.
Now I need to find $1.5k to buy Bitcoins and a bad memory
