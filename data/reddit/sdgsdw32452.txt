I doubt that will ever happen.. and they'll have plenty of time to address the issue. They'll be lucky if 5 people use it in the next year imo.

Very few asians have bitcoins to spend at the moment.. I'd estimtate perhaps 40,000 chinese have at least 1 btc based on giving them a 20% market share. How much does the bitcoin using demographic overlap with air travel? I kindof doubt it's worth AirAsia's time, but they'd get a lot of press out of it that might be good enough value to cover the bitcoin integration costs.

they're all right.. the differences reflect other transaction costs/fees involved in trading on the different exchanges.

try  - pretty similar setup to bitstamp - but no verification needed. There's also  which is the fastest way to get BTC anywhere really. The wire transfer to either bitkonan or bitstamp will take a couple of days too so if you want the coins faster definitely use bitbargain.

It's damn near impossible.

you could also try  - they're often the cheapest.. you can pay by bank wire or even credit card if you can get your visa/mastercard to work with liqpay.com.

I think there could be other edge cases as well.. for example, say someone loses their colored coins; do they just say 'oh well, I guess that's too bad' or do they try to force the issuer to issue a new colored coin? Most likely the latter. Similarly I doubt the issuer can avoid becoming a party to any legal disputes that arise over the transfer of colored coins.. and if that is that case (which imo, it surely is) - what's the point of recording this stuff in the blockchain at all? Ultimately the issuer will still remain the highest authority - not whatever is recorded in the blockchain.

Try getting them to wire into btc-e or bitkonan.com - neither require verification before receiving bank transfers, so as long as the reference # is correct I expect it will work.
