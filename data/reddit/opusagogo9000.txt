"So you think that money is the root of all evil? ... Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or the looters who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil? ... Not an ocean of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into bread you need to survive tomorrow. ... Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is men's protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values ... Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked: 'Account Overdrawn.'"

unlikely because bitcoin value is tied to fiat money, currently. and fiat money is tied to energy, illegal drugs, war and bankers, the same old same old. if fiat hits the fan, so does bitcoin.  You'll be buying $45/gallon gas with bitcoin , it'll just be $45 worth of bitcoin but the same amount of gold will buy $4 of gasoline as the same amount of gold will buy $45 worth of gasoline.  if you could somehow de-couple bitcoin from fiat and onto something scarce, then it could be a reserve. however, very unlikely.  if you were to attempt to do this, people would arbitrage the dollar vs bitcoin vs gold because bitcoin is coupled to the dollar and not a real thing.

Bitcoin isn't a scam, but you are to late to the party. By the time you get your BFL ASICS, block reward will go from 50 to 25 and difficulty will be 20 to 30 times what it is now.  Also the BFL machine won't work for 10 years without replacement, probably 1.5 years at best before it dies.  Your Dad will win the bet, but only because you should have been mining since last year.
According to the calculator, at 20x difficulty increase and if BTC price stayed where it is, it'd take 700+ days to just break even.

where i live logging is virtually banned. guess what happens. it burns down every year and is wasted. you can't even go outside for 2-3 weeks out of the year. and the byproduct is no jobs and a huge meth epidemic. 300 sqmi burned right next to me. and the forest trees per board feet are at a all time record right now. so i guess we should just let the tree huggers win and just let it all burn down. because fuck the forest and the watershed. let the topsoil erode so that it can't grow back for another 500 years.

First off, I never claimed to compare Bitcoin to an equity. Straw man. Second, you aren't making any kind of qualification for your argument against your straw man.


Again I never claimed any of this, and you don't qualify this, so I can't comment about your straw man arguement.  But I'll tell you this: if you don't consider Bitcoin to be an asset, please feel free to send me all of your bitcoins.


Bull shit. 


Bullshit. If BTC trades at $1 in on currency, and BTC rises in value, it rises in value globally.  The arbitrage is between other currencies, not bitcoin value.

@_date: 2013-08-27 18:53:48
actually there is one attack scenario where this isn't true.  If Mining difficulty becomes extremely high (i.e. grows quadratically) in a short period of time, and then if some or most of the miners suddenly stop -- for example because they are required to register as a money transmitter, then theoritically the remaining miners wouldn't have enough hashing power to finish the immediate block.  Then it becomes impossible for the two week block adjustment to finish, because the difficulty level is so high nobody is able to finish a new block, thus locking out all transactions.  This happened with testnet back in the days -- somebody joined with a GPU right when GPU hashing just started and screwed up testnet.

Just keep calling back.  Tell them the same story. When they give you the run around, just start all the way at the beginning and repeat yourself again.  You might have to do this 5-6 times or even a dozen times on the same call.  Just be polite and sound like a broken record. Repeat yourself over and over again.  You might have to be on the phone for an hour or talk to 4-5 people. This works almost everywhere except for companies out of New Jersey and New York for some reason.
