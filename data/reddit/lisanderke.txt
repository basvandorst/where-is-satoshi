HashOcean was a Ponzy scheme! The site has been sold off to it's vendors and no comment yet on their social media. i wouldn't be surprised if we won't hear of the site again.

It was pretty stupid to sell your skin and get the money directly in your bank account. Always use something in between your bank account - things governments check - and the seller. If i'd be selling a CS:GO skin, i'd sell it through a trusted site. P2P never works IRL, either meet up with the person and look 'em in the eyes, or use something you trust in between.

 But how would one take their bitcoin out of the address without using third-party wallets? do you have to eventually sign in online to send out btc of your cold address?
