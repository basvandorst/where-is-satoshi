I recon we only need to adjust the blocksize maximum to 10mb.
But more importantly, we adjust the difficulty and reward in a way that blocks are solved on average every 3-5 mins.
Then implement the change on the next block halving.

I didn't know Hal died.
Good guy will be missed

Wow, everytime I see a thread or something like this open up to help Noella &amp; I out I'm gobsmacked!
You guys have just been so god damn great!  I can't thank you all enough.  
If the bitcoin community was only occupied by people like you guys it'd be enough for me to quit my job and start a town with you all at Satoshi Forest!

Gav, what about a no ponzi stance for starters and go from there?
PS, thx for the work on the protocall. If I could code complex programs I'd help.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:36:40

I thought I read somewhere that satoshi was the only miner for a few months?
If thats the case then the first one listed is less then a month after The Genesis Block on 3rd Jan 2009
Seems like Satoshi

Isn't UFC just code for "hugging competition"
The UFC seems to be full of grapplers nowadays, and makes for a slow boring fight. I miss the days of blood and teeth all over the place!

So, who's going to start with the DDOS attack? 
It'll be better then any solution that ghash.io will agree to.
@_date: 2014-10-17 12:37:45

NVM, found this...
@_date: 2014-10-17 13:40:55
Yup, couldn't find anything for a few pages. That's the problem with a busy subreddit :)

But my PC hot hacked into. A series of bad luck allowed it to happen.
Won't happen ever again. This device will help my security greatly :)
@_date: 2015-04-05 02:42:20
That's a myth.
In the very very unlikely event someone tried to scam your wallet, stick your contactless chip next to another contactless chip. 
The interference causes the scan to fail :)
@_date: 2015-04-17 04:29:12
I got the same thing.
I thought at some point I messeged BFL-sonny, after reading your PM it's obviously just a bulk message.
@_date: 2015-04-26 16:40:05
Pew pew
@_date: 2015-03-29 13:18:35
Increase taxes in not a bad idea. How about they increase the tax on the rich. 
Or do the mining tax (without upsetting Gina Rinehart).
Or Maybe reduce they own salaries.  When Australia's PM gets paid nearly DOUBLE the US President gets paid, something is wrong.
When Jackie Lambie gets paid more then the Chinese PM, something is bloody wrong!
@_date: 2015-03-29 13:20:29
sorry guys, I shouldn't type on my little laptop sometimes. 
 
@_date: 2015-03-29 15:10:11
Get Joe Hockey to go on QandA. Tony Jones will force him to admit it's a tax! lol

But still, stay the fuck away from my bank

I thought this was another Parody Post!
@_date: 2015-02-22 08:27:52
Has anyone proved that?
What if I withdrew money from an ATM and spent it on drugs?
What if the bank decided I looked like a druggo?
What if I transferred money to someone they thought looked a druggo? 
Would it be okay for them to threaten me?
Also fuck a bank for telling me what I can and can't do!
@_date: 2013-10-05 12:59:55
Like I said. ANYTHING is better than nothing.
A landing page is the best idea

QUANTUM ATTACKS?!
This is just made up conspiracy rubbish. There is no such thing as a quantum attack.

because he's a dirtbag that sells them to scammers
@_date: 2013-10-04 03:21:49
Because that would involve thermos spending time/money on the site.
@_date: 2013-10-07 14:46:20

Lol thermos. Given the amount of shit you lot have given me I won't be misspelling that again :)
@_date: 2013-10-12 13:42:03
Is it possible he was using the android version of blockchain that has predictable random numbers, thus a 3rd party has the ability to generate the same private key?
Just a thought.
@_date: 2013-10-03 07:48:57
thermos - THIS is what happens WHEN YOU KEEP ALL THE DONATION MONEY for yourself, instead of spending it on updating the forums.
Not the mention the $10,000 a week you get for advertising!
GREED brought the forums down, not someone's simple (yet hilarious) hack!
Shame on you thermos. Shame Shame Shame.
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:20:50
