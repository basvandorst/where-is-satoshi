That's true, wanting legal accountability for theft is morally equivalent to stealing a billion dollars. Thankss for that valuable input user 1930197.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:33:00


That's the "so what" part.
This is how you get some real stupid bullshit in politics.  Saying two things are bad and ignoring the enormous, profound moral gulf between them is ignorant and actively damaging to healthy discussion.
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:47:24
Yes, the only problem being the disqualifying problem...
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:09:18
literally the point of the entire thread, bud.
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:16:23
that's fine, I prefer my candidates to have a "vision" that's remotely tethered to the reality I'm in but obviously that's a personal choice.
@_date: 2015-04-08 12:06:12
You're using that phrase "the government" as if the thousands of state, local, and national legislatures and agencies were humming along in perfect harmony, acting in unison to stop Google because "the government" is paid off by Comcast or just hates innovation or something. This is a dangerous oversimplification that's leading you to some weird conclusion about how it's even *possible* to just get "the government" out of the process. 
That's the problem with these faux libertarians like Paul, is that he shrinks these issues down to some superficially reasonable-sounding argument that doesn't actually apply to anything in reality.
Not having net neutrality doesn't remove government from the equation, and cutting through the dozens or hundreds of local ordinances and agencies isn't possible from a practical standpoint, and isn't remotely the only reason why innovation and competition doesn't happen on the cable industry. Having a set of rules disallowing companies from performing certain anti-competitive practices is helpful, not harmful, in fixing the awful mess that industry is in right now.
@_date: 2015-04-08 12:08:22
Oh yeah, I can't wait for the utopia of no meat or food handling regulations. I don't want any gubmint standing between a company and my mad cow disease.
@_date: 2015-04-08 11:58:38
But that simply won't happen, so practically speaking his argument is wrong, and we need net neutrality.
@_date: 2015-04-08 21:08:38
Describe for me exactly what the "free market" version of the cable industry looks like?  
Because to me it seems literally, physically impossible. How can physical access to cables that run up to your house not create insurmountable barriers of entry?  How would that ever lead to a wide open market with tons of competing firms?
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:30:29
Well sure, everything sounds good when you posit your utopian outcome as an assumption in your argument. This is how libertarians capture the "gee wouldn't it be nice?" votes.
We'd all rather live in a world where we don't need government regulation because companies like Comcast are kept in check by our individual actions, but we don't live in that world and it's damaging to approach these situations as if we might.
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:35:31
I'm referring to your "Sharpe's chances are slim, but they exist."
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:25:40
This logic makes zero sense. Whatever Republican they run against cuomo will get ~40% of the vote. The libertarian *might* get what, 3-5%? 10% if he's wildly successful beyond all expectations?
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:24:13
Right, but predicting he's going to win in a landslide is very different than squeaking through on a tiny margin after the largest collapse in history. Trump didn't win so much as Hillary failed miserably. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:47:22


literally untrue, is what I'm saying.
Better chances of getting to 10% than a republican has to *win*? Maaaaaybe. But to win outright? Lol, no.
A democrat who doesn't want to vote for cuomo just won't vote, they aren't going to vote for another candidate. I mean, some might, but not like 45% of the state.
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:42:19
Well, he didn't win in a landslide so
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:53:34
It's the 46th best electoral college performance
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:42:17
I don't agree to that, the claim is factually wrong and absolutely not a matter of opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:26:43
So is paypal and prius for that matter.  What the fuck.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:15:40
It's a kluge, like most economic systems.  No one sat down one day and decided that this was the best way to pay servers in restaurants.  Could we come up with a better system?  Sure.  Will you being a dick and not properly paying your waiter fix the system?  No.
It's one thing to have a theoretical discussion about this stuff, but the moment you don't pay someone their wage because you think you're smarter than the system is where we have a problem.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:45:02
There are some upsides to centralized authority and nondemocratic institutions, and that's when they are actually behaving in a rational and beneficent manner it's difficult for internal actors (ie opposition parties) to throw a wrench in the works for their own short-term political gain.
Of course, there are lots of downsides to those institutions for precisely the same reason when they act irrationally or with malice.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:23:07
Now you've made it awkward.
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:35:44
I'm so sorry for people who have to talk to you in real life.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:02:07
That feature isn't relevant to the issue of anonymity, the analogy is fine for the purposes of this discussion.
And you aren't even correct-- bank of america certainly does not create dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:47:48
I think you're wrong, but I'm not sure which of our interpretations is correct.  My reading was that financial institutions like banks, etc. are not allowed to use it, but they are allowing it to be traded online and I don't see anything about vendors or stores not being allowed to use it.
The problem, of course, is that companies receiving bitcoins in payment will want to be able to store those payments in financial institutions, which won't be allowed to treat it as currency.  So there's more risk (to the extent that companies like CoinBase are a risk), but I think vendors are allowed to use it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:00:33
This joke was already done better in the front page thread.  Shame on you.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:22:55
I don't have any extra info, but I just experienced this myself.  Put in my ID stuff (it was correct), it said something like "could not verify at this time" and now it has a 24 hour cooldown before I can try again.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:13:15
So, at this point I have to assume you're being purposefully obtuse, because there's really no way you could misunderstand what I was saying to that degree. 
Continue being a pedantic asshole on the internet, it looks good on ya.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:25:28
This is like saying banks are bad for dollars, because they take an anonymous currency and attach an address for it.
No, it's bad for people who want to use dollars anonymously, but many people don't care about that.  There are still plenty of ways to use them anonymously.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:19:58
Yeah, this is actually a big problem with people who are victims of scammers.  Through a job a few years ago I read a lot of correspondence (FOIA responses) between the FTC and various members of congress, the FTC's response every time is essentially "Sorry, even if we *could* do something about this your constituent was trying to help someone steal millions of dollars, so tell him/her to kindly fuck off".

That's only true for link karma, not comment karma.  As of right now, RES says he's got +42/-10.

@_date: 2013-12-05 18:51:01
Yeah, I was about to invest in some NameCoins just based on the cool idea when this went off like a lightbulb in my head.  It can never take off as a currency because the more popular it is the less utility it will have, limiting its popularity, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:28:06
How is a payment system not technology?  His argument makes no sense even internally.
Someone with that view should not be the moderator of something like @_date: 2013-04-29 18:12:15


This is simply not factual in America.
Tips are part of the basic wage.  Everything else you said stems from this faulty assumption.
18-20% is the *assumed* amount of tip.  If they were particularly terrible or particularly good you deviate a bit, but unless they are really rude it's really difficult to justify leaving less than 18%.  Most of the things that go wrong while you are eating out aren't the fault of the server, it'd be like docking an hour of your salary at your office job because the email servers went down and you couldn't contact someone when you were supposed to.

Then call the bot's maker and yell **SIGN UP** as loudly as you can.
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:16:36
It's not brainwashing, it's just a different remuneration system.  It's not about ethics or morals, it's just how restaurant servers are paid here, and it's different from where you are from.
You're refusing to see a pretty simple point, which is that we do things differently from you.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:55:33
When you go into a restaurant, sit down and order food, and then the bill comes, you've contracted with those people to pay them on the terms of the system in place.  If you can't see the difference between that and asking me to pay you to comment then you might actually be retarded.
If you don't want to tip, go to mcdonalds you idiot.  It's like going into the restaurant and walking around on the tables because you don't feel like you agree with the tradition of not walking on tables.  It's incredibly disrespectful to the people trying to make a living in the place that YOU WALKED INTO.
