Hmm - do you have some numbers showing that even at 4x less transactions BTC would still be more profitable for miners to mine, as compared to BCC?

I was in Japan for a week and saw no evidence of crypto other than this one sign. So it's not like it's everywhere.

Interesting thoughts - I'm always on the lookout for stuff about fundamental evaluations.
To your point about the LN - bitcoins code base is very different and the LN can't just be copied pasted onto other coins. I'm not saying some coins won't adopt a LN themselves, but the idiosyncratic nature of cryptos means you can't just steal tech as easily as that. Once it is proven to be in high demand other coins will pursue it but this is a rare area where bitcoin is ahead technologically,
To your point about the LN lowering demand for bitcoin transactions - I'm not sure how? Instead, it massively increases the demand for transactions by making bitcoin usable. If Starbucks as a LN then yes, people will buy bitcoin to use it. The LN is all in bitcoin - it's not like a second crypto built on top of bitcoin. You're always spending and buying in BTC.
Additionally, you need to lock up a certain amount of bitcoin to use the LN. Most transactions won't be 1:1 - instead I load my channel with a certain amount of money, generally more than I need for any immediate purchase. This means that even bitcoin going to get spent will have a significant percent locked up at any one time since everyone won't calculate out their purchases ahead of time, reducing supply. 
And finally, since LN makes the bitcoin network more usable it will add growth to the network, and metcalfs law says that the larger the network, the more it is worth,

massive difficulty adjustments to cope with loss of hashpower wold mean cost of creation would go down, thus decreasing innate value of BTC

rofl no saying that an autocratic regime is autocratic is not the same as dropping the n-bomb. One is literally discriminating based on nothing but melatonin count and the other is correctly pointing out the existent political culture. Stop whining about political correctness when your state is sterilizing tibetans en mass and jailing poets you idiot.

I have been in Japan and seen only one billboard with bitcoin on it. People saying it is huge in Asia - there is no visible effect of it. Never saw a restaurant or a sign or a poster beyond the one billboard. Just so people know.
