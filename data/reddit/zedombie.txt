lol he thinks he’s gonna be buying a DQ for 200k, that profits him 170k a year? News flash dumbass if something was profiting 170k a year you’d need to buy it for closer to 750k. I know as I’ve been a part of MANY restaurant sales. Also, in case that wasn’t ridiculous enough, you’re NOT going to be profiting 170k a year from a ducking Dairy Queen. To profit 170k a year you’d need to do about 100k in sales a month. No Dairy Queen in 2019/2020 is making 100k a month in sales.
This guy is screwed. And he seems to have a mouth on him too.

lol, also according to a seperate post he thinks buying a Dairy Queen is going to make him 170k a year. But he’s buying it for 200k? News flash dumbass you’re not buying a DQ for 200k a year if it’s profiting the owner 170k a year, and also you ain’t making 170k a year off a single Dairy Queen anyway. This guy is going to get absolutely fucked.
