There was a guy that posted the day before bcash was accepted to coinbase stating he has a buddy that works there. He was telling people to buy it. The next day it was added. In the same post he states ripple was going to be added next. He deleted his post once people kept saying he needs to be in jail for insider trading. But it is found in the archives.  I am not home or I would provide it for you.

What exchange should I use?  My brother told be bitrix may not be safe to use anymore. I have some dogecoing and feathercoin I would like to convert into litecoin or Bitcoin. Also debating on investing 300 of it into bitconnect. Suggestions?

I have been using shapeshift.io

Majority of people think ripple is going to be added to coinbase. I think when that happens it will make the price skyrocket.

Okay. I will take this as dead is dead. I am not sure how it works specifically. Thanks for the verification.

Thanks for the input. I am kind of kicking myself. When ripple was .22 and Ltc was 390ish I wanted to convert all my Ltc which was 7 ltc to ripple. Sad I didn't do that and got the FOMO going on right now.

Which exchange site do you suggest for converting alt coins to bitcoins?  
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:05:13
I have 4 LTC.  Should I trade them for BTC or Ripple?  LTC has had a steady downward stream lately since it hit the 350 mark.  I am assuming everyone here will say BTC, but keep in mind that each BTC transaction is about $33 and I am poorish compared to the BTC community.

I live in the US. I plan on using coinbase for btc and ltc but they don't accept my other coins. They do look like a Ponzi scheme but the math states they are making money and only paying you if they make money. Unless you deposit lots. A buddy and I are going in halves on the 300 to take a gamble. I have never heard of shapeshift. I will look into them. Thanks for the info!

Is there any chance for Segwit2x to fork or is it officially dead?
