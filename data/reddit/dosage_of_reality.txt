I'm sure the goal is to get content creators on board... Either you distribute it here as an official source and get paid, or someone else will.

Due to the way qr codes are, it's trivial to cheat by writing a simple program... Just letting you know.

The price increasing is "getting off the ground".  Btc price cannot stagnate after numerous halvings, which is the time limit.

This is an interesting perspective.  btc has a self-imposed time limit to get off the ground before it's no longer justifiable to mine or process transactions on the network.  
I think society will adopt a cryptocurrency eventually, as the utility of one is very high.  I don't particularly think it'll be bitcoin, as it's inevitable that further developments in cryptocurrency technology will generate a better alternative.  That said, I hope they do adopt it, as I'm currently down thousands of dollars in value that I'd like to at least break even with.

Are we not directly incentivized to make sure decentralization is maintained to keep bitcoin secure and trusted and therefore valuable?  If an entity gets too much hashing power they should in theory self regulate unless they are purposefully trying to sabotage the network.

When comparing values it's proper to keep them in the same units

The day the government sets up a bitcoin address to accept anonymous voluntary taxes I might care what they think

The problem may be that it'd cost them more money to accept bitcoin than they could get out of it in donations.  They would have to hire and retain a tech team that could change it to dollars or figure out optimal ways of spending raw btc.  Then they'll have to hire specialty lawyers and accountants to make sure it doesn't bite them in the ass due to some financing law.

Right now it's mostly to support the system and the technology.  We need users who adopt it for no reason other than they believe this type of technology needs to exist... If enough do that, it'll expand into its full potential of a widely used economy.

Assuming they understand computers and basics of networks and the internet:  Bitcoin is an agreement between thousands of other users that you own a currency.  Transactions are you authorizing computers to share a new agreement.  Explain that the system is held together and made fair due to high level complicated math they'll maybe understand when they are in grad school... 
The big difference in explaining is really who is a trusted source for financial history and is it provable... Instead of a central trusted agency, it's a distributed untrusted network using math for agreement.

Seller verification? or can I just scrape gw and sell that
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:18:20
This sounds more like a loan to me.  Stores who do not already accept bitcoin can take a loan in fiat and they pay me back with bitcoin at an exchange rate determined ahead of time.  You're fronting a loan, expecting bitcoin back.  You are shouldering the risk by offering fiat up front in return for a profit in bitcoin later in order to bolster usage of bitcoin payments.
I feel the loan analogy is familiar where your explanation was way too confusing.

Because society has many rules that not everyone agrees on, and moral relativism is law... The paper should really be about the needs of society vs the needs of the individual, when they don't align, and due to technology what is good for society is blocked in favor of relativism and what is good for the individual.

I understand and I hope it works for you... was just attenuating expectations for buzzwords and slogans.  I think at best you'll get ideas like I've suggested and you'll have to take them and get creative without losing the message.  But at least ideas here will give you a better jumping off point.
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:40:22
I think you'll find that bitcoin users at this point are mostly utilitarian and they don't need buzzwords.  They first and foremost need to understand the concept in a clear manner.  That said, "loan" is the easiest accurate concept, however it is just a springboard because it's actually a bit more complex than that.
Other similar concepts are "investor" since you are investing in their bitcoin infrastructure, and they pay you back in bitcoin for that investment... but investments are just loans.
Bitcoin payment infrastructure developer is another way to look at the same thing.  Like building developers put up buildings, you are establishing bitcoin payment adoption by fronting the money to businesses.
The buzzwords you choose to make it exciting is up to you, and exciting marketing is worth thousands of dollars, not a couple bucks.

This is specific to one quantum algorithm... Quantum algorithms are still in their infancy and they did not hypothesize about scenarios involving alternative cracking solutions.

Moral of the story... Use sequential numbers for any process where the identifiers can know about each other.  
This is of interest to btc though I suppose to make sure methods of generating wallets is valid.

Is there an auditing process for bad submissions?  Vote bots?  Can readers submit tl;dr synopsis style reads for people who want to listen but only want the meat and potatoes?
@_date: 2015-11-24 22:22:00
Do you curate a list of readings and readers can be directed to them?  Can readers easily see what has and has not been read by many others?  Do you provide a baked-in sound capture method after a redirect or do readers have to have their own recording and editing software?

Any transfer over $50 I want a confirmation asap.  I will not leave the person or place until that happens, which means it's a giant hassle.  Bitcoin is not really made for small fast transfers, e.g. Regular commerce.
