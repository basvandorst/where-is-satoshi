This is the downfall. Get your money out of coinbase before it cracks and all we have left are silly memes

You are damn right, who defines what is in the basket of goods? How about rent? mortgage? assets? It's clear there's massive inflation once you consider everything
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:32:26
He still have a point. But I guess it will be fixed if more and more people pay in bitcoins
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:32:48
Loans do come out of thin air. There’s a rate of 1-10 of every dolllar deposited. It’s one of the reason why modern economy os so bubbly and why There’s so much money in finance
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:31:22
Also Why the centralbanks will start helicoptering next debt crisis. Nothing has been learned. It’s scary bit true that often people in authority is as clueless as everyone else. Maybe more because they are beholden to legacy and special interest

The inflation rate is bunk. It’s impossible to capture the hole market accurate, and thus like everything they curate slices of their own choosing

2 years of staring at power point slides and 2 years of professors telling you to go educate yourself and labor free of charge. I fail to see the rationale behind why it’s so expensive. I think it’s only because suckers will pay the price of admission and their ability to milk the patients afterwards.

The rich are the one siphoning your wealth by having their whole wealth in Capital assets that appreciate with inflation and central bank action. Then they lobby to pay less tax on their incomes than schmucks WHO's income is derived from working
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:05:45
Jesus, I'm the beneficiary of the current politics, however it's not fair that labour is more taxed than capital income..

@_date: 2017-08-04 13:28:48
I don't get the point of these post... The only thing that really matters are the demand for the currency.. And that involves a great deal of the application, ease of access etc.. of the coin than how 'long' it is!
