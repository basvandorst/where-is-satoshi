Bitcoin: why all those ppl?
Segwit: your friends from BS
Bitcoin: why this ugly coffin?
Segwit: it is a gift, but you must take this first; it' s soft, really soft. 
Bitcoin: You mean this softfork thing? No please. I will have some blocks first. You know, i am kind of growing.

Segwit is anything but Bitcoin. People do not have to trust the miners because the system is taking care of the proofs validity. Segwit want people to trust his system. The problem comes with the buiseness plan is not about  the community,

Bitcoin is about decentralisation. The segwit thing will take us slowly toward the good old banking system. You have no choice unless you lose all the fiat invested.

I may do some editing real quick. Bitcoin has not been designed by Satoshi. Blockstream is a non profit organisation. 'Core Devs' are allowed to think by themselves. Segthing is an opensource software by design. Core devs(more than 100) are delivering more than 4 altcoins a day, with a creativity level of more than 76%. They are not aware of anyone ever attempting to freeze the blocksize limit. The ugly coffin laying in blockstream front door is not a gift from A.Back to Bitcoin, after swallowing the Segthing liquor.

You got it right. Bitcoin is not country, sex, religion or class related. This is one of the reason ppl rejected Segthing. It is anything but Bitcoin.
