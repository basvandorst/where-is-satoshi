The only thing I regret was not buying when it was $100 and my friends were using it to buy weed off the internet

It’s called a “speculative bubble” 
People thought Bitcoin was going “to the moon” and they bought on the basis that their investment will get a nice return. 
But, the value of Bitcoin is pretty lost right now. No one knows what it’s real value is now because of all of this outside whale money. No the whales are pulling out and the little guys are getting ass fucked. 
It’s not a “bubble” in the traditional sense.
People should remember that Bitcoin was primarily just used to launder money and buy illegal shit off the deep web.

I would like to point out I’m not rich, I did well off Bitcoin but I’m not living a high roller lifestyle. The beach is free and Thailand is cheap ;) haha so as long as I’m still making some money on cryptos and online poker so I do okay. 
I’m going back to the UK to study criminology and sociology this year and hope to have a good idea what I want to do after it, definitely more travelling though

You misapprehend me. I was saying that people say HoDL and then cash out, I just used 200% as an example. I don’t tell people to Hodl

Same. Have people forgotten it’s original use? Bitcoin is not for you to get rich quick and play dress up as a big city stock trader.

“Don’t sell at 15k guys!! Just HODL” 
*proceeds to sell at 15k because it’s a 200% return*
The HODLers are crying rn. 
The guy who sold all of his worldly possessions including his house, to buy Bitcoin, who now lives on a campsite with his family. I hope he got out in time

Haha you have no idea when I got in and when I got out. I was using Bitcoin for ounces of weed a long time ago, thankfully I used to buy a lot of weed! 
I’ll be getting back into Bitcoin when all of this MESS is over.

As I said, I hope he’s fine. You’re right he probably is, I got into trading Bitcoin at 4K too and I’m doing alright. 
Sipping cocktails on beaches in Thailand is pretty much all I do

Wrong. I’m still buying drugs off the internet with bitcoin

1000 people own all the Bitcoin stop pretending you’re in charge
