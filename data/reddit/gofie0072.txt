Read the book: Thinking slow and fast. A book by a nobel prize winner in psychology. And you will understand the psychology behind what i am saying..

Social media is ruining our world. I hope all die soon.

What i am saying is that after seeing something a thousand times something becomes part of you’re subconscious. And that book explains how our conscious and subconscious thinking works, so how does not have to do anything with what i am saying?

Why make a copy of a device thats used in a failing system
@_date: 2019-10-10 22:07:18
Of course you don’t because the dollar everyone already knows about. A shit ton of people don’t know about bitcoin yet. It isn’t normal thus why you also say “it’s just weird”. Before the dollar no one ever heard of a dollar and spreading info about a dollar was also “just weird”. 
It’s someone’s subconscious we are targeting when we promote bitcoin. Thus also why you are saying “its weird”. Cause it isn’t a part of something which is normal. Thus why we need to promote bitcoin so it becomes more normal and not that shady currency 0.001% of the world uses. Every little bit helps trust me. Its all psychology.

Guys its part of a paradigm shift. It works like this: the more people see the bitcoin logo or anything to do with bitcoin, the sooner a fundamental change in approach towards bitcoin will take place. People will become more interested, will be more aware and at some point bitcoin in society will be absolutely normal. Think of it as introducing the concept of a dollar to someone who has never even heard of fiat, overtime the dollar became the standard: it was a new paradigm and now its absolutely normal to use a dollar. The same will happen with bitcoin and it will happen faster if we promote it everywhere.

False. Cause when they look into it, they will see it actually stands for something and not some kind of troll.

Facebook is rat poison squared.

Every bit helps. Seeding the conscious of unaware people :) Eventually people will be interested when they see the same logo pop up 3 times.
@_date: 2019-10-11 22:30:15
Who did?
@_date: 2019-10-10 18:09:42
I know it sounds ridiculous, but everytime someone sees the logo we are closer to adoption. Its called a paradigm shift ;)
@_date: 2019-10-10 21:02:12
You explained it perfectly, its about shifting the paradigm of the world. Even these little things will in the end have a great impact on the recognition of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-10 21:07:29
Its seeding the conscious. Whenever the same logo pops up again, someone who doesn’t know bitcoin will start looking into it. Its what brands and governments do. Trying to shift the way of how people think :)
@_date: 2019-10-10 22:10:55
Dude what is your problem? We are not saying that you need to do anything. We are only saying that the slightest things would help bitcoin and its recognition. Thus changing maybe a pic in youtube of which most of the people in the end don’t really care about.
@_date: 2019-10-13 15:46:40
Not everyone knows or has heard about it..
@_date: 2019-10-10 21:03:38
Its what governments do everyday.
@_date: 2019-10-10 22:00:57
You really don’t get it do you? It’s about introducing a new paradigm. If people see the bitcoin picture more often they will become curious, something will start living in their brain. Its planting a seed in someones conscious. And whenever they see the whole story of bitcoin, bitcoin will look 100x more legit since they’ve already seen other people with it. Its pure psychology used in marketing. These minor things add up to the whole picture eventually trust me.
@_date: 2019-10-10 22:15:36
Thanks for your comment. It all comes down to psychology and what we see as normal. Its part of how see stuff and how we determine something thats normal and whats not. If you see a bitcoin logo flash by a hundred times, people will first become curious, then take action researching what this thing is, then see it another hundred times. And after all that the subject bitcoin has become normal for them. Something which was before weird internet money has became the future of money.
@_date: 2019-10-10 18:21:50
Doesn’t matter how you promote bitcoin, people just need to see it for the paradigm shift to take place.

So what would your advice be, set a certain goal and don’t look at it/dont get led by your emotions before it reaches it goal? Or never touch any asset which is volatile like bitcoin so you don’t get trapped in the cycle of emotions?

I stored my private keys on my laptop, my laptop crashed and 10k worth of crypto was gone. It was really painful, but i learned from it. I bought a nano ledger s and now i have everything safely stored on there.
