Wow the mempool has gotten lower, I noticed on segwit party charts we are seeing the implementation of Segwit slowly chugging upwards and then a sort of spike about 48hrs ago.
Local Bitcoins did implement Segwit about 2 weeks ago but you start getting segwit addresses (starting with a 3) on your 2nd transaction with Local Bitcoins.
I gotta think local bitcoins is a pretty big lplayer for on chain transactions so maybe it took 10 days to begin getting fully implemented.
Also lightning network has nodes running which might be helping lower the mempool backlog... Apparently lightning nodes are popping up relatively quick by enthusiasts who genuinely enjoy setting stuff like that up.
But yes we have more work to do but coders are always working... Regardless of price, and we have more coders and developers than ever before.

Interesting how right after Bitcoin price crashed, the searches for stocks reached the highest levels on the chart.
Looks like a lot of people who took some profits near the all time high invested it into stocks. As Bitcoin price went down in spring 2018, tech stocks went up.
Just wild speculation on this. Still interesting.

Honest to god smart people do fall for these things. It's not about intelligence, the scam uses the victims emotions to get around intelligence.
Family  and close friends of Bitcoiners who did well with Bitcoin in 2017 often feel conflicted about their friend or siblings new wealth....and they can become vulnerable to scams with the desire to "catch up".
I personally know of someone who put money into one of those "gifting circle" scams after her brother became the family golden boy for buying Bitcoin in 2017.
It's about emotion not intelligence.

One post mentioned the taxes that would need to be paid stating they may be really high depending where you live.
How high % wise can they be? For someone living in Montreal where income tax is the highest in all of Canada the taxes owee would be considered a capital gain (assuming you didn't buy stuff with it) and at the very most would be about 25% of your profits. So if someone bought 1 BTC for 10K USD and sold it for 14K USD the total gain would be 4k and taxes owed 1k leaving 3k after tax gains... Plus the initial 10k investment of course.
So at most in Canada you pay 25% on your profit. And that only if your in the maximum tax season bracket of about 50%
Not that bad... Moral of the story is pay the taxes and sleep comfortably

It's the very high leverage available to traders that will for sure be part of the play.
With 15 or 40 or even 100 times leverage on a cash settled trade, it's so worth it for a whale to buy up the physical bitcoin even at a loss because of the massive leverage they will make on the cash settled contract.
But they will make money on both the physical and cash settled contract trades.....but someone could literally buy bitcoin intentionally at triple the current market price and theoretically overpay by 300% and still come out of this golden using leverage.
But they will make a profit on both, just like when the whales shorted using leverage and took profits selling physical Bitcoin.
There's not that many Bitcoin around to trade. The game theory with physically backed BTC and cash settled contracts with 25X leverage is a whole nee chapter or wealth creation. Be part of the parade or watch it go by....you can choose.

LN couldnt be used in 2016 because there was no maleabilty fix in place then.
The transaction maleabilty was fixed in August 2017 with Segwit.
Although LN was in development prior to August 2017 much of the progress had to come post segwit. 
Thr question is impossible to give a date for, but many of us didnt expect to be using LN on mainnet in 2017, and certainly not on mobile devices. So it's realistic to presume LN iadoptio is moving faster than expected.
Next gen wallets that let us tranasct on the main blockchain and also on LN all in the same wallet app, and moving back and forth seamlessly....Well we all want this.

A friend of mine suspects his ex wife used Bitcoin to hide assets during their divorce.

Posts with titles like this are a sign we may have exhausted selling pressure. (And we have bounced off $6k all summer long.
In the bull run of 2017 we would see barely a fraction of so many bearish posts on reddit. The optimistic price posts have declined and bearish posts have slowly but steadily increased since the spring. We all can see the change, and it's perfectly normal. This fits investing psychology perfectly.
Remember last November when your pharmacist, dentist, or even Uber driver were talking about buying Bitcoin to you...they were so bullish, and excited. Remember those family dinners where the stories of Bitcoin wealth resulted in people learning how to open an account on an exchange like Coinbase? 2nd half of 2017 made on heck of an impression on peoples minds.
Well its become clear that the last few months of late  Summer 2018 we have reached the opposite state of late 2017. And this had to happen.
For example, I mentioned Bitcoin at a dinner recently with some 30-40 year old professionals and they all were pessimistic about Bitcoin, shock their heads and a few laughed with a tone of arrogance. They didnt even know if or when I sold or if I still was holding. Some looked at thier wives with a look that said "see hun, I'm financially responsible"
My Uber driver usually says nothing or something negative about Bitcoin, this is literally the opposite of last year. Last year I helped 2 Uber drivers buy their first Bitcoin and installed android wallets with them....
Also many Youtubers and social media are making videos confidentiality declaring how the price will go down. And those channels are getting views and subscribers. 
We have seen this before, there is some risk in acting before the stampede begins. But this time around I believe it's going to be big, bigger than I can comprehend. Anyone who holds 0.5 Bitcoin will have enough wealth to significantly change someones life.
There is blood in the streets, and IMO the smart money knows it.

I think the biggest changes will be off the main block chain protocol. Like better wallets, atomic swaps, using lightning and another side chain seamlessly all on the same wallet app on your cell phone.
Since the mania of Decmbeber 2017 there's been that tsunami of innovation. Some really smart entrepreneurs with the capital to bring products to market are moving ahead full steam.
So in the next 3-6 months it will be products built on top of Bitcoins protocol.
Bakkt will have "products" on top of the Bitcoin protocol.
For the protocol itself, you can look at the list of BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) I think that's what you mean.
Often a BIP being implemented leads to the newest app features....Samurai wallet is full of extras.

Notice the recent uptick in videos with Roger about Bitcoin cash? 
With BCH  about to split into 3 coins it looks like a final desperate effort to pump the price of the new hardfork coins that Roger and fake Satoshi and Cobra and Jihan will get, since they hold large positions of BCH.
They will be dumping many of those new coins fast, and this little media campaign is a great way to generate hype and create bag holders for them.
This new bcash coins will be worth very very little within a few weeks, but they have thousands and have a giant exit scam set to roll.
Some of this hardfork capital will inevitably end up back in Bitcoin, which is where it all started for Bcash 13 months ago.

My friend, whatever you do, do NOT move your Bitcoin into some alt in Hope's of making your money back quick.
That is exactly how so many people lost a hell of a lot more wealth.
Seperatly looking at Bitcoins price we can see that the downward trend has stopped for several months now. The downward momentum has changed to sideways movement. One could argue this is a change in Bitcoin price movement from bearish to neutral, and every day, week and month we stay at these levels makes the change from bearish to neutral trend more and more relevant.
In order to get bullish it's very likely we will move sideways for awhile. This will build confidence as the psychology shifts and becomes an accumulation phase.

To all of us who have been watching Segwit transaction rates increase over the last 13 months. 
(Today Segwit transactions are currently around 44% of Bitcoin transactions, and still increasing)
Here is a link to track progress from the start
As you can see the  50% milestone is very close
Any thoughts on what would increase segwit adoption even more, for example when Coinbase integrated Segwit we saw a jump of over 10% which is huge. Local Bitcoins added segwit and we saw a smaller increase. Trezor switched early and really helped.
I'm patiently waiting for Segwit to pass the 50% milestone, I was sure we would see it by this Halloween...But heck maybe it will be this Christmas.
Is it Mycelium  wallet holding us back? People are switching to Samurai in a big way.
Is it smaller exchanges that need to upgrade? 
I know some wallets like the Bitcoin.com wallet will not upgrade.
Is it expensive for established exchanges or wallets to upgrade to Segwit? Is there a developer group that has made it easier to facilitate upgrading?
Is it strictly just a matter of patience or can we facilitate upgrading. For example dont use Mycelium wallet, Green and Samurai are on the app store and are better anyways.
Thoughts on Segwit adoption? Any time estimates to break the 50% milestone?

Nothing wrong with making money as an educator.
Andreas has done far far more good for Bitcoin than harm, because he said there will be hundreds of coins and tokens and eventually thousands of coins and tokens.

Yes that was a great Ted Talk ;)
Segwit is such a huge milestone. And yes I'm excited to see the 50% milestone be reached but it's pretty fair to say the current 44% of transactions on chain being Segwit in just 1 year is a success. 
There was FUD last year saying it would take years to integrate in a meaningful way. But here we are, onchain we can handle way more volume than last year, but IMO more importantly is the 2nd layer networks and then layers built on top of those. When    its seen through that lens I can see that every alternative coin is essentially a  testing ground for what will be adapted to be built on top of 2nd and 3rd layers of the Bitcoin main chain.
I saw a list of wallets and exchanges showing where they were at regarding implementation of Segwit. I'd like to see how its changed over time. I'm still optimistic of 50% by this October 31st....just 6% left to go and we have seen 5% increases in 1 day several times already.
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:00:55
It's a very important question, always ask.
Samurai wallet is excellent. You can get easily from the Android app store for free, and it's very easy to use. But has all kinds of extra features if you want to try them. It's also a segwit wallet by default which is important, your transaction will be a segwit transaction and you dont have to do anything extra.
After Samurai is Green, but I have less experience with it.
Then is Mycelium which is old school, but does have segwit implemented in it. So until they upgrade I wouldn't use it.
Samurai is so easy, it's the best wallet for your Android in my opinion.

Is LN currently decreasing fees and mem pool congestion? 
I think this is difficult to determine, but are there transactions that in the past would have happened on the main chain for sure, which are now happening on LN?
I'd love to see LN transactions increase, and lower the on chain transactions in a way that shows some correlation.
Of course LN allows for all kinds of transactions people might not normally do on the main block chain. 
The LN wallets are already easy to use, Id estimate another 3-6 months and they will really easy to use. Eventually we might not even have to specifcly the difference between on chain and lightning transactions, it will just be default.
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:08:55
This is pleasant to see. Bitcoin is evolving before our eyes.
Batching alone took so much pressure off the mempool, then add in Segwit and the Bitcoin of today can handle the heavy transaction volume Bitcoin saw last December without even remotely close to the delay backlog and fees we saw in December and January.
And Segwit adoption keeps increasing.
Todays Bitcoin is twice the Bitcoin of 8 months ago.
Keep on building, testing and optimizing.

The LN wallets are already easy to use, Id estimate another 3-6 months and they will really easy to use. Eventually we might not even have to specifcly the difference between on chain and lightning transactions, it will just be default.

Yes there are several "emergent properites" that I'd just love to be used as metrics that we have yet to explore, many have emerged as the ecosystem evolved and many that didnt exist at all or in a meaningful way just 2 years ago.
For me I think  changes in the size of the tertiary economy around the Bitcoin ecosystem is fascinating. I'd nerd right out with this stuff.
New Employment created in the Bitcoin ecosystem ... I'd love to see that kind of data. The idea of jobs of real being created was just a dream not too long ago. Now students are studying this stuff and entrepreneurs are getting creative and the race is on...globally.
The list goes on.

As Bitcoin grows and evolves the value proposition of Bitcoin has emerging beneficial properties that couldnt be easily predicted in the past.
For example it took 8 years for Bitcoin holders to get hardfork money. No one predicted the value that would add. In fact many people thought it would harm Bitcoin.
There will likely  be all kinds of new emerging benefits for holding Bitcoin going forward.

36 months ago the difficulty level seemed through the roof, the difficulty chart today is so high, it makes the first 8 years look like almost nothing at all, just a flat line until the last year, and the last 3 months are a essential vertical line going straight up.

I don't hold any LTC  but its important to remember how Litecoin has worked in a co-operative way with the Bitcoin community. And in several key ways added security to Bitcoin.
One example is how Segwit was tested on the testnet in depth. Then still, before going live on Bitcoin main net, Segwit was live with the Litecoin blockchain for a period of weeks first. Almost like a final layer stage of testing for bugs when real money is being used. This really is congruent with the status of Litecoin being the silver to Bitcoins gold.

It's made to payout new bitcoin equally, no matter how many people are trying to mine with massive mining rigs it still pays out at the same rate.
Of course the miner reward is cut in half every 4 years. Right now its 12.5 Bitcoin every 10 mins, in spring of 2020 that becomes 6.25 Bitcoin every 10 mins. In 2024 it will be 3.125 Bitcoin, and keep halving until we reach 21 million.

This is yet another example of how during 9.5 years Bitcoin has always always made long term holders lots of money. Every single time it has dropped massively it always went back up and set a new all time high by several orders of magnitude.
This has been true 100% of the time, and it's very likely to be true again.
Emulate what the people who have made the most money are doing for success. Is it too boring to buy and hold? Dollar cost average in?
Then after building your stack, if you cant resist the urge to trade take a separate stack and trade it for an attempt at quick gains...but as long as we know the most developers are working on Bitcoin (not even close to 10  of 5he top 50 alt coins combined and Bitcoins ecosystem includes the best and brightest with the most experience, and the most new  financial capital is going into the Bitcoin ecosystem, far far more than the alts combined.
The writing is on the wall. So many indicators are right there.
The problem is new people are confused by top notch marketing and hype. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:36:21
Wait the cost to move 30,000 Bitcoin can be the exact same as moving 0.05 Bitcoin, no?
Although $0.19 is a very fair price, people are moving BTC for under $0.10 all the time.
I'm not squabbling over 9 cents, I'm just wondering if they increased the fee a bit because its such a large transaction?
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:59:00
Very few expected Bitcoin holders to profit so much  from new fork coins which they could then turn into more Bitcoin.
IMHO that is just a small taste of what's to come, and people or organizations who hold whole Bitcoin independently on the main chain will continue to have multiple types of opportunities to generate new wealth from the Bitcoin they own without ever having to sell the coin(s) itself.
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:17:27
If I were forced to pick, I'd say Japan or Malta.
Or one of the countries with a currency collapse will turn to it. Venezuela with the Petro is the closest example.
(South east Asian countries are in the mix too because they lead adoption on certain use case metrics.)
But it's very hard to make that call. I'm guessing wildly with my picks.
Which nation state has the most pro crypto leadership? Would odds lean towards a capitalist nation or a socialist?

Andreas Antonopolis just put out a video about this exact topic,  It has really gas good points and has me reflecting.
An ETF would get A LOT of the future big hard fork coins, and they also would likely choose not to implement soft forks that promote privacy....that's just a few of the first issues to arise.
If it's not your keys it's not your Bitcoin...a few large ETFs could eventually control massive amounts of BTC, and fork off themselves.

The research budget that went into just the Halong miner technology, must have been rather large. It creates jobs, both directly and indrectly.
The other chip makers stocks have been on an tear the last 6 months...AMD for example.
It's possible that's Samsungs Halong research will be utilized in other products. Whatever benefits share holders most is fiduciary duty.
That's just Samsung, there are lots of private firms investing too, and likely massively, and they dont have to report anything like a public company.
The motivation to keep the price of Bitcoin high is in a whole new universe of reality compared to just 12 months ago.

When we look at just how much has been invested into research and development of faster, cooler, quieter and more energy efficient ASIC miners just in the last 12 months we begin to see Bitcoin ecosystem is indirectly impacting other sectors.
For example ine big problem in the AI/machine learning sector is the massive cost of powerful computational power...Bitcoin and other ASIC research will likely remove technological barriers a full year early.
Gaming graphics and proccesing will see a massive jump ahead, driverless cars, the internet if things all can be done faster and cheaper because of research for better miners.
Maybe another few months for industry leaders to integrate the technology over from crypto....but I'd be the early innovators already are.
Samsung Halong miner research will be used in more than just miners....and maybe miners will be used for more than just mining.
Let the eentrepreneurs and engineers run with this.

There are several changes in the overall fundamentals that suggest the bulk of the downward pressure is over. (During this cycle)

Miner incentive is cut in half every 4 years.
Miner incentive also decreases almost every 2 weeks as the difficulty for bitcoin increases alloat every 2 weeks.

Google searches lag Bitcoin price. So yes Searches are correlated with price but as a lagging indicator not a leading, coincident indicator.
I'd say hashpower is more of a leading indicator.
Edit- I'd love to see a metric showing new developers involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem. And how that correlation has changed over time.
Or data about how the ecosystem and its emerging sectors over time. Everything from,  growth in 2nd layers like Lightning Network, to Bitcoin node software like the 17 reiterations of the software. To hashpower and spending in venture capital. How many jobs are created both direct and indirect.
Heck even have the app show how often the federal reserve mentions the word Bitcoin or blockchain, which is relatively new.
What about academic research like peer reviewed articles?
Track new websites, apps, television relavant to the Bitcoin ecosystem....all has a psychological normalization of Bitcoin in society over time.
Of course new wallets, segwit %, and other emergent metrics as they are invented, implemented and adopted (Schnorr/Mimble Wimble/RSK for example)
I'd love, I mean love an app that lets people track data like that.

Say what? The more people using segwit means the more overall throughput the blockchain can handle. Even if someone never uses segwit, but like today 40% of the network is using segwit that legacy user still gets cheaper transaction fees and less delays by more and more people using segwit, the network can simply handle more volume.
And of course all the benfits we can get by solving the transaction maleabilty bug with Segwit.

Welcome aboard.
You said you have a wallet, great...so 2 tips. 1 Remember "if you dont own the private keys, you dont own the Bitcoin"
When ETFs eventually come along we will see them keep hard fork coins. Because they own the Private keys as custodial holders of the Bitcoin. That's just one example...
2nd tip, which solves the issue of controlling your private keys, is use a hardware wallet! This means a Trezor or Ledger. The private keys are stored in the device and never touch the internet. Lots of people have lost Bitcoin that was on their phone or laptop..it happens all the time. Nowadays Trezors and Ledgers are very user friendly. If you have more than a few hundred in Bitcoin get a $50 Trezor wallet.

The mistake was setting the fee so low when the network is a little busier. Everyone else currently has paid a higher fee than you so mine will pick those transactions first because it pays them more.
It doesn't matter how much Bitcoin ($ value) you sent. $2 or $2000 is all the same, it's the fee you pay that determines how soon you get in a block..the fee you paid is about 3 us cents, which is enough if you wait a bit usually will get you in a block within a few hours, sometimes right away in the very next block when it's not busy.
The problems happen when new people just start choosing drastically higher fees than needed to "ensure" they get in the next block. It  better for everyone (except miners) if you just check the mempool to decide your fee or use your wallets fee estimator.

Where are all the chart technical analysis folk saying the descending wedge in Bitcoins price? It appears we left the triangle awhile ago and keep moving out.
Even when I adjust where the line touches the tops of the wedge (basically cheat) the price of Bitcoin has moved too far too the right to be contained inside the wedge.

In a way that original BCH hard fork created a lot of new market cap for Bitcoin because it was something  so many people sold to buy more Bitcoin, same with Bgold.
Roger still holds a lot of BTC he didnt sell. 
I feel all his meddlings with Unlimited and Bcash slowed down segwit by a few years. That's what hurts.
But Bcash is still an excellent testnet and the Bitcoin community learned a lot about what doesnt work, without having to expose Bitcoin to risk. 
Even things like the emergency difficulty adjustment tought us so much how miners game theory works.
If Bitcoin ever does increase the blocksize even a little, this will be very valuable.

Mining is really taking off in Montreal, and all over Quebec and it's new people getting into it.
For example we went to a friends house for dinner last night and her husband has an ASIC running under the porch. He's a high school science teacher.
Quebec has cheap hydro and there are small and large mines popping up all over.
I friend of mine is an electrician and he's a no-coiner. But he knows about Bitcoin now because hes making a bundle working on people mining rigs. 
Its interesting to see the small entrepreneurs creating work from the mining boom. Consultants, people who will help optimize your rig. There are so many opportunities to make money help people make mines more efficient.
Then this new  era of buying and selling mining equipment. That alone is growing big time, and the middlemen are making secondary income by leasing the equipment to mines during the time between the buy and sell. Why let it collect dust for a few weeks when you can use it.
1 year ago it wasnt like this at all....it wasnt even like this 6 months ago. It's really great to see.

If you send $100 or $100,000 of Bitcoin the fee is the same.
Also since the fee is usually less than $0.10 its worth it to send $5 around for example,  from, your electrum to your mobile phone wallet and back just to practice. It really helps to get the feel for it.

So instead of waiting for privacy to be built into the Bitcoin protocol, this is people building new features ontop of Bitcoin in the apps like Wasabi wallet.
I'm still just understanding how broad the number opportunities to build are. So so many.

It's as easy as using a wallet that is uses segwit. You dont have to use a Segwit wallet, old wallets like Mycelium still haven't upgraded to segwit but everyone is switchin, it just takes time. Your coins will is fine, but yes it's nice when people move to a segwit wallet.
Big jumps in the % of segwit transactions are often after a major wallet or exchange upgrades. For example when Coinbase upgraded to Segwit we jumped about 12%.
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:36:05

If the community is involved we will do far better than if the community doesnt participate at all and leave it all to traditional financial institutions.
We need committees with our leaders on them, we need Bitcoin devs as part of the for profit companies and liquidity products....If not other greedy bastards will happily take on the roll.

And now Bitcoin moving inversely to the stock markets.
Lightning Network and Liquid make 2nd layers much easier to conceptualize for the average investor. It was not so easy to see just 1 week ago.
Bakkt...that too.
And of course Segwit recently went above the 50% mark, and other really important metrics have been climbing steadily since spring, specifically how many transactions are being done per day has increased steadily despite things like batching transactions that would make the metric appear lower.
Dont forget hashpower! Which has continued to double roughly every 2 months through the entire year despite a price decrease....That's a lot of new investment, heck the network was  already incredibly powerful and battle tested a year ago!!...In fact Bitcoins hashpower is nearly 7 times as power as it was last October, and is still increasing every 2 weeks by roughly 25% of what  the entire network had in total last October...Pretty wild.
Here's a link to see the hashpower chart

Also just the wallets and exchanges using better fee estimators would really help keep fees down.
In December people would often just enter a fee of $25 to be sure it went through right away without being able to see what the current rates were. Great example of how just better wallets make a difference.

@_date: 2018-10-11 03:00:05
I'm wondering what metrics Liquid might have an an impact on?
Blocksize might decrease? Lower mempool and a decrease in confirmed transactions on chain while inputs and outputs increase?
Maybe at first the metrics will resemble the impact of exchanges starting to batch transactions together this spring?

Escape room games have been very successful in Montreal over the last 2 years. 
A group of about 4-6 friends do a new escape room, roughly every 6 weeks. We often invite a new person or couple to join, and for us most of the enjoyment is about the group you play with.
Tonight we did a Bank Robbery scenario maze. And this company A/Maze has a few locations around the city, they are great but we agree that all the competitors for Escape Mazes are really good.
We did Prison break,Mad Scientists Lab, and Military Complex, Pirate ship, Museum.....and some others. Some with live actors, and puzzle solving as a group is so enjoyable. Our lives are richer because of this.
So at this location today there was a Metal "replica/novelty"Bitcoin glued to the concrete floor. That's when they explained that some locations now accept Bitcoin and they plan on accepting Bitcoin in more locations soon.
Which is great because, IMO many of people who enjoy solving these seductive logic, scientific puzzles, mysteries and riddles tjat are offered by these escape mazes, are very similar and like minded people who are interested in Bitcoin....Like minded people.
So Escape Mazes are great and Bitcoin is amazing!!!

Is either BLS or Schnorr facilitated by a maleabilty fix like Segwit?
Perhaps this is a bit of game theory, but if between BLS or Schnorr, one is much more difficult for the non-Segwit Bitcoin hardfork to "copy and paste" into thier project like has happened so many times before.
Similar to how non-segwit forks or coins can't easily "copy and paste" the code to integrate with the Lightning Network.
I want the best choice between BLS or Schnorr, but if both are relatively equal, then consider choosing the BIP that isn't backwards compatible with the contentious hard fork.

In the end the safest way to do this is to learn how to use Bitcoin. It's not that hard, and there are loads and loads of people who spend hours a day trying to steal other peoples Bitcoin.

 blocks are processed every 10 mins and new Bitcoin is created each block.. the miners have a huge incentive to secure the network and compete regardless of fees, they will mine nearly empty blocks...its the newly minted Bitcoin they want, not the peanuts in fees.
Maybe in time (decades maybe) Bitcoins main chain will secure and process other things than just BTC as we know it...or some innovation we can't imagine yet will generate fees for miners in our children's lifetimes when we near 21 million Bitcoin mined. That's a long time away.

 I'm glad I asked, I'm beginning to understand this better.
What inspired the original post was that bet between Tone Vays and the Bcash leader. If the mining pool did put Tones transaction through before a higher fee transaction, regardless of having the moral high ground and the best intentions for Bitcoin, it did get me wanting about the protocol for selecting which transactions go into blocks and when.
(I don't know if that bet story is accurate at all since it's based on social media content which is notoriously unreliable)

Heck the white paper for Lightning Network wasn't out until 2016 and Segwit was implemented August 2017.
How could lightning have been around before Segwit. (Theoretical discussion about Lightning in 2015 doesn't mean Lightning was built.

If Lightning keeps growing like we expect, I have a feeling there will be several unexpected opportunities to profit for people with knowledge and experience gained from things like running a lightning node.
The experience gained will pay off in more ways than just fees.

The Bitcoin Core wallet is excellent and the easiest way to run a fully validating node.
But for someone new the combination of a hardware wallet, and a mobile wallet are what I suggest.
 Hardware wallets both Trezor and Ledger work great. (Use these to hold the majority of your Bitcoin)
For smaller amounts use a  mobile wallet on your cell phone. Samurai or Greenaddress, Mycelium or Bread Wallet are all good choices, but there are many other good ones.
You the mobile wallet to bring Bitcoin back and forth from your hardware wallet. For example if you go buy Bitcoin at an ATM, or anywhere in person its logical to use your mobile wallet for this, and them later, in the privacy of your  home or wherever then send the Bitcoin from the mobile wallet to your hardware wallet.
Its not logical to keep large amounts of money on your phone. Some people do, but Id suggest just enough to buy something

People are definitely moving more Bitcoin around, its been trending upwards steadily for months.
In Nov 2017 fees were way way higher than they are now. That's validation for how much Bitcoin has evolved.
@_date: 2019-02-07 20:46:52
You are exactly right.
The same thing with the website Bitcoin dot com it's a bcash website selling BCH and many people are ending up buying BCH and sending it to an incompatible Bitcoin wallet. Or sending real Bitcoin to a Bcash wallet....
For a new person that must be very frustrating and it's hard to imagine that helping anyone.
I'm sure many new people ended up with lost Bitcoin from this. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 21:42:03
To be fair, in addition to Segwit and batching, fees are also low because users are more educated about selecting appropriate fees and Bitcoin wallets have improved the fee selection features.
So many inexperienced brand new users in 2017 just kept increasing fees often by several hundred percent above the already high fees in the previous block. 
Brand new users wanted to be sure they got in the next block so they could feel comfortable they did it correctly.

@_date: 2019-02-08 00:33:32
Yes let's hope.
The previous incidents when the MT GOX trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi flooded exchanges with open sell orders at market price was criticized by the media and members of the Bitcoin community plenty of times. He was told to sell via OTC or/and sell them at an auction in a manner similar to the US government's auction to sell the Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road operator.
There were lots of articles and interviews discussing the consequences. And hopefully it was enough to change the selling method for this next (and final ?) selling.
Perhaps more importantly, we need to keep in mind the failure of fiduciary duty by the trustee to the creditors/victims as they recieved far less money than they could have it the Bitcoin was sold more responsibly. The victims recieve far less money as the the price was driven dow  during the selling. Even now the creditors/victims who chose to recieve physical Bitcoin or have them sold for cash will recieve far less value after all the price crashing already down by MTGOX trustee over the last year. If the Bitcoin was sold responsibly they price could very well be trading at a higher price today, helping creditors receive a much higher value in financial reparations.
Does anyone have any new info on when and how many Bitcoin are left to sell or distribute?

I'm certainly not as knowledgeable as some people here but for starters it will be a long time until the block reward goes to zero....literally over 100 years.
But yes in 15 years the reward will be halved enough to be smaller  but still not zero, in 10 or 15 years Bitcoins ecosystem will be so evolved that there may be all kinds of new incentives for miners aside from block rewards.  
Bitcoin is only 10 years old, things are evolving faster than ever...what will the next 10 years bring, the next 15 years?

In war zones it's the middle class who often don't leave because they have all their wealth seized. So they end up staying while the poorest flee.
I'd love to see new ways for people in places with crisis to buy Bitcoin. It could be a game changer and profitable for both the buyer and the service providing the access to Bitcoin.
Heck there are many middle class and upper middle class families who have wealth in places like Damascus but cant leave because it means starting over. Many people cant sell their houses because the money will be stolen.
Sell the house, business, investments and buy Bitcoin....leave the country with 10% cash and 90% Bitcoin...let the guards take the cash and start a new life in another country with your life savings.

With lightning tips coming to Twitter and such, why wouldn't someone start selling a pre paid lightning card.
Mostly for tips and micro payments but for new people to get in easily, it could be priced at a large mark up and still sell well.

That is certainly enough selling volume to crash the price, even if those Bitcoin sales were spread out over multiple days.
But I suspect this seller didnt even try to spread out the sales. Probably just massive sell orders at market price.
Last I heard its roughly Feb 14th that the final batch of  MT GOX Bitcoin is released. However this time it can be received in kind without being sold, and those that are sold will be sold in a much more responsible way, using the OTC market and pre arranged private sales. (Let's hope)

Thanks and yes I knew the qoutes were at least a way of implying sarcasm or being sardonic about a "simple hardfork"
My concern is avoiding any confusion at all that it was a refernece to hardfork to  Bitcoin Unli~/
People said alt coins are using new tech and bitcoin is the original same platform...thats not true and having no promotional budget as an open source peep to peer, Bitcoin core which is the name of the group organizing since the start relies on people making slick youtube vids..we need to dispell the myth the altcoins have 9 years of more advanced platforms...and bitcoin is still running the same thing expect the odd patch.
Video editors, tell the truth about how bitcoin has changed and evolved  and has the added advantage of programmers who beleive in the mission with passion. Thia passsion, will let people work extra hours for free and happily contribute and share ideas with people in different departments, because they believe the job is meaningful.
Compare that to code writers for an alt coin hired on contract who are there to collect a pay check. THAT DIFFERENCE is what Napolean Hill descrives in his 1940s famous book called "Think and Grow Rich" still selling today.
Bitcoin core has is not a group. They are a team with high cohesion and openness. They utililze emergant  leadership which recently Google said emergent leadership qualites are the  thing we desire on our team.
Bitcoincore is a common bookmarked site, but they dont advetise so most people go to sites lile coindesk or bitcoin.com first because they paid for that..

 But whats for sure is this: 1 Satoshi or 1 whole Bitcoin, the eco system is growing and a 9 year head start over the alt coins that really will be hard to catch. 
The hard fork is PUBLICITY!!! And now more people are aware more deeply of Bitcoin, and this has a very silver lining to it. All the other PUBLICITY we gkt for free too, the ETF twins was a hugely amazing public awareness campaign that mainstream media didnt cover nearly as much just 2 yeara ago.

Im no tech master, but if the Antminers by Bitmain are the (cheat/innovative) way to mine. 
Furthermore, Antminers are NOT Segwit compatible, so logically thia is a huge reason we see a chunk of miners makikg every excuse under the sun to avoid signaling Segwit....
If the above is basically correct, than shutting then down would get Segwit acivated sooner. And 2 create less difficult barriers for miners and suddenly mining is a whole new opportunity for everyone (espcially the small miners)
Its a double bonus.....leading to a cascading effect of multiple side effect benefits, so many benefits can branch if from Segwit, and also malijg mining profitable for everyone again...

Easier to buy  Bitcoin than ever before...including an increasing amount of Bitcoin ATMs that are getting more user friendly, with lower fees, in more and more locations.
More peer reviewed academic research and thesis papers being done regarding the Bitcoin ecosystem by graduate students.
The list goes on...
And yes more active Bitcoin addresses.

The daily transactions confirmed have been increasing since drastically decreasing in February and March.
This is a very good thing, it indicates that Bitcoin is being used more and more. (despite exchange volume decreasing). Its happening off the exchanges in the OTC and P2P markets.
The last 6 weeks transactions have increased drastically. And the lowest day of each week (Sundays) have been trending up at very high rates.
Higher lows and higher highs for months.  Bitcoins blockchain is being used for sure!
@_date: 2018-11-12 17:35:41
There have been higher and higher lows since July.
When a price bottoms the gains are often very subtle.
The descending wedge chart, Bitcoin had been inside for 9 months has been invalidated, and every day at these prices continues to invalidate that trend. 
The descending wedge pattern wasa the most dominant bearish technical analysis thesis for Bitcoins price during the last 9 months..The current price has invalidated this thesis, and it's becoming more and more obvious just eyeball ing the chart.
Every day and week that we trade outside that wedge (even if the price is, just sideways) is adding weight to the bottom has been reached, and this has been an accumulation period.

A few years ago, we only dreamed that large tech companies would be investing into R&amp;D in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Intel is one of several that we know about so far.
These companies have to answer to shareholders and have to be somewhat sure about a risk level for new investment.
I'm sure there are other companies doing the same that will only be public after the patents are filled. Some of this is proprietary knowledge, that took a lot effort and resources to do.

Yes, and at 10 min blocks thats 2 weeks.
Time is much easier for people to understand, and the difficulty always adjusts the block creation period to a time measurement.
But yes its blocks, which sometimes are 1.5 weeks or 2.5 weeks.

Speaking of scaling the confirmed on chain transactions is still climbing.
Sundays are always the lowest volume, yet this last Sunday was the highest transaction volume for a Sunday since last January, when things were crazy.
It must be happening off the exchanges OTC because the exchanges dont appear to have a change in volume.
@_date: 2018-11-05 15:58:43
Here's some evidence.
Notice the lows on the chart (they are always a Sunday) they have been increasing all summer and especially into September and October and now November.
The highs are increasing too, just the same....the last 6 weeks especially strong but trending upwards since March.
Ever since the mania back in December and January.
This data suggests that OTC transactions of Bitcoin are happening more and more over months now. Its happening off exchanges.
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:48:45
You can see the last day on the chart is a Sunday(at the time I'm posting this) and from last Sunday to this Sunday we went up 25,000 transactions.
Its significant because Sundays are always the slowest.
This metric is getting really hard not to notice
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:05:34
There was a time when members would have been delighted with news like this.
Instead many people seem upset in the comments.
Venezuela has become the best example in Bitcoins history of people using Bitcoin as a defense in a hyper inflationary economy, and the trend is gaining traction fast.
This will likely grow exponentially with every country facing hyper inflation or other economic crisis. 
This can start a whole new network effect.

One of the best on ramps into Bitcoin....and easy to observe healthy competition working with Bitcoin ATMs as user fees have dropped while quality of  services has increased during the last 2 years.
ATMs are all over Montreal these days, no KYC just scan your phone or print out a paper wallet.
Some but not all are 2 way ATMs, these are becoming more common in the last year.
@_date: 2018-11-07 11:47:34
From say Bitfinix to Bitstamp? Exchange to exchange, that's Liquid. 
From Coinbase or Bitstamp to a customer's wallet? Hard to say, it depends when the exchanges spend the resources to upgrade their systems. I suspect it will be new exchanges opening up with Lightning transactions from the start, then existing exchanges will be forced to upgrade or be left behind.
I cant predict a date for this....Ok, wild speculation is by the spring we see this start becoming more common.

@_date: 2018-11-06 14:22:52
If the blocksize increased first and then we added segwit later the impetus to adopt and implement Segwit would have been far far less. 
Also increasing blocksize last year would have resulted in far less impetus to develop lightning, and other 2nd layer solutions.
Seeing the high fees of last December showed the importance of these things, and simply increasing blocksize would have set development and implementation back by months, probably years.

A tsunami of new developers and creative entrepreneurs are building all kinds of projects on the Lightning Network.
I'd love to see metrics that help track the  human capital coming into the ecosystem. What are the sub sectors being worked on, where people are investing   energy, time and money. What skill sets are most utilized in the ecosystem and what skills are most needed.
For creative entrepreneurs there are so many opportunities, and then opportunities to learn, innovatie and improve ontop of every other project. A coder, an artist, and maybe a go fund me or a credit card along with a strong positive entrepreneurial creative attitude are an example of all it takes in these early days.

Yes precisely. More transactions is indeed a good thing. Especially since batching is more widely being used since the spring.
Heck just Coinbase batching transactions together puts downward pressure on the number of transactions. Which makes the increasing trend all the more bullish.

It seems that many people are unaware Bitcoin is not the same Bitcoin as it was even 1 year ago. I suspect many people think that the newer an alt coin is suggests it's newer technology, like 2018 technology coins compared to Bitcoin 2009 technology.
This is why we update the protocol and Bitcoin has come a long way. And now we will see why segwit is so valuable. Lightning requires segwit, and in just 3 weeks since going live on the mainnet lightning has 600 nodes running.
You can run a lightning node, and the more segwit is adopted and studied the more "Easter eggs" will be invented. Atomic Swaps on the Lightning Network is a great example, which happened about a week ago.
Bitcoin can produce ICOs with RSK and I'm excited to see what utilities will be discovered when Lightning, Segwit and RSK are combined.
Or Atomic Swaps, or Mimble Wimble
Its coming together fast now

Here in Montreal Canada, ATMs have been booming the last few years.

Can someone tell me if multipath payments have been implemented?
For example if a payment from me is 0.3 Bitcoin, can it route through 3 different channels with 0.1 Bitcoin each to get my payment of 0.3 Bitcoin in the end?
Here is a description from Lightning Labs 
Atomic Multipath Payments (AMP) - allow large Lightning transactions to be divided into a series of smaller transactions as they’re sent over the Lightning Network, but in such a way that they’re automatically joined back together. The user sees only the total amount of the transaction, without needing to be aware that AMP is being used behind the scenes. AMPs also ease the mental burden of using channels, allowing a user to interpret their balance readily as the sum of balances in channels. This is made possible by the ability to send and receive an AMP-like payment over multiple channels, at both source or sink.

Good BRD works really well on iPhone.
They recently updated the BRD wallet to have an option to use Segwit.
I'd suggest enabling it in the settings, it will let you have even lower fees when you transact and helps lower fees for everyone else using Bitcoin too.
Using Segwit is important for the whole network, and will allow all kinds of other upgrades over time.
Here's a link to show you how Segwit has been adopted since it was implemented in August 2017. Many of us track this metric, as it somewhat helps gauge change in the ecosystem.  So you can see that when a wallet like BRD invests and upgrades to  Segwit it really helps with adoption.  Eventually all (or almost all) of the Bitcoin applications will be running with Segwit or be left behind.

It is indeed fast enough to be considered instant.
The user experience is getting easier and easier too. I predict it won't be very long until many users are actually transacting on the LN and just calling it a Bitcoin transaction because the wallets become so user friendly that average user won't need to know or care if they are using LN or the main chain.
It will just be called using Bitcoin. Under the hood stuff will be for tech savvy people but the average user won't even know if lightning was used.

It appears that the increase in transactions is not happening on exchanges.
People are indeed using Bitcoin, but it seems like OTC or directly person to person.
Local bitcoin, BISQ and Paxful all have been increasing in Bitcoin volumes over the year but in the last month have stayed steady or even slightly dropped. 
Can we figure out where this volume is coming from?I hope it's simply organic and comes from lots of different people using Bitcoin all over instead of a few large users.

This book "The Bitcoin Standard" is written in a way that's very easy to read.
Even total newbies will understand this book, and experienced Bitcoiners will appreciate it too.
Several chapters are very relevant, and add lots of value but aren't about Bitcoin.

It usually about 6-12% above the spot price. For the convenience of scanning our cell phones QR code to buy Bitcoin it's worth it.

My question- It seems like sending Bitcoin data via satellite from space to most of the world,  "might" have got the attention of govt agencies. 
Nothing like this has ever been done before, and Bitcoin itself might still be looked at with apprehension by certain people or organizations.

I have this feeling that there will be more unexpected ways wealth is created in Bitcoin (something like the way we couldn't predict  the hardfork coins the Bitcoin holders recieved)
Except this wealth will be for LN nodes.

Yes I re-read this and your right.
There doesnt seem to be trading involved. No market making with matching buyers and sellers. 
I do think that Fidelity will earn more than just fees for holding people's Bitcoin, if it's considered an asset they probably will be able to use it to borrow against and create wealth.
Eventually people might begin earning interest for letting Fidelity or Ameritrade hold their Bitcoin.

Amazing to see how fast LN has grown in just 11 months.
After the awareness created by the price mania in late 2017 there is an incoming wave of young software developers around the world who have decided to focus there learning and work around Bitcoins ecosystem.
Eventually the few young developers who took contracts to work for ICO's that actually hired a developer or two will take that experience to Bitcoin, and its 2nd layers like Lightning and all the new ideas we haven't thought of building yet.

@_date: 2019-01-24 18:20:13
This is a useful metric.
I would much rather see a trend of increasing  Bitcoin transactions on chain than a trend of decreasing transactions.
We know that Lightning transactions don't show up here, along with other side chains are not part of the main block chain. This was not even a factor to consider 18 months ago. And as lightning and other 2nd layers progress it's fair to assume that more and more transactions will be happening off the main Bitcoin blockchain. That's very exciting itself.
So despite batching transactions &amp; 2nd layer transactions rapidly growing rowing in use, the number of transactions on the main blockchain is still trending up. 
At the end of the day, this metric suggests Bitcoin is being used more and more. While fees are staying much lower than previous times we had volume of this level.

Wait. Are you saying there are places 'selling Bitcoin" that won't let you move it to your own wallet? 
Is this common?
Buy your Bitcoin OTC, even if you pay a premium. It's your own coin. If this is true then the 21 million cap is being inflated with cash equivalent, and then obviously fractional reserve stuff.
Own your keys, it's the only way I've ever known Bitcoin. And with P2P services like Local Bitcoins you meet interesting people and actually learn from each other.

People get scammed when they stop using the sites messaging service to communicate between the buyer and the seller.

There is an opportunity for new services to take a share of users who want Segwit. And it will only get stronger the longer these big exchanges take.

Bitcoin is being looked at as a new way to store energy, maybe computing power by some people. 
Building a hydro dam in Northern Canada was never economically feasible before because too much infrastructure expenditure is needed to bring that energy to market. 
Now Bitcoin is a whole new kind of battery, or way to store energy.
A natural gas well no longer needs hundreds of kilometers if pipelines to get the energy out of northern Canada. 
Why invest millions in powerlines and/or pipelines with endless regulations when you can just mine Bitcoin at the power source and then move the energy value via the internet, cell phone or even cold storage. 
It changes the game.

Adoption doesn't happen perfectly.  A few  years ago Bitcoiners would have only dreamed of something like this.
Although not perfect, this is a real step towards adoption. The awareness this creates alone will be significant.

Check out this chart showing on chain transactions up until yesterday (Monday)
The lows on the chart are Sundays (every Sunday is increasing too, and the highs are increasing too, for months now, but October and November really are jumping to January 2018 levels. 
This suggests transactions are increasing off exchanges in the P2P market and the OTC market.
We can see evidence of this increase looking at the P2P exchange BISQ.
And transactions are increasing despite batching being used. Just think that last winter Coinbase wasnt batching transactional outputs together, so the transactions are artificially lower these days than the winter, yet we are at January levels.
At this rate we might see the mempool start to backup in a few months from now. Hopefully Lightning and Liquid side chains will relieve some of the volume pressure.
Thankfully it appears the improvements in the Bitcoin of today can handle transaction volume of last December and January without nearly any problems. 
One thing is for sure, the blockchain is being used more and more, Bitcoin is moving around.

If the block time goes from 10 mins to 12 mins, there is about 20% less Bitcoin being mined per day (until the next difficultly adjustment which would now be at about 16.8 days instead of about 14 days.

ATMs work great. I love them.
If you do it in person do a small transaction first just to be safe. All you need is 1 confirmation you can be confident it's legit. I've personally never seen a transaction not go through after 1 confirmation in my life. 
But if you want to do it in person, and you never bought bitcoin before, then it's a good idea to use the ATM first and do a test transaction with a small amount $40 or something. This will let you see how it works and get a bit of experience...its easy as pie, but still when you buy hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin, you will feel more confident if you do a small transaction first.
But using the ATM is what I suggest. You might pay a slightly higher premium maybe 8-10% above market price but in person sellers charge nearly that too.
If you meet the in person seller, meet them in a cafe or public place. Your not doing anything wrong and don't need to hide. The risk meeting someone in person for the first time is they are some thief. It's never happened to anyone I've met but I'm sure it's happened. an ATM  run away with your cash.
Again all this is minimized drastically if you start with a smaller purchase. Then do another bigger one. Or multiple purchases if your buying a lot, maybe do a small $50 test and then 3 larger purchases in a row, or over 2-3 days....whatever makes you comfortable.
 
Remember this is thier job, they make a profit  selling Bitcoin to people and any halfway decent Bitcoin seller will make a new customer as comfortable as possible. The seller knows you are taking a risk meeting a new person with cash and they want you to post positive feedback about them on whatever service you used to meet them (localbitcoin, paxful and BISQ are good) and want you to come back for repeat business. In person sellers are also facing a lot of competition from ATMs these days...So do not hesitate to ask them to do a smaller transaction first, its thier job and most of them are very nice and will be happy to have coffee for 30 orn 40 minutes or so to take care of all your needs and make a new customer.
I hope this helps. Both the ATM or in person work fine. But if it's your first time I really suggest doing a small test purchase first and waiting for a confirmation before buying more.
It's easy, I just want to make sure it goes smoothly for you.

On chain transactions for Bitcoin have been trending higher all summer and into the fall, and now Bitcoin transactions have spiked to the highest levels since mid January 2018.

The volume increase has to be somewhere I suspect OTC because its not being reported by exchanges, and the Bitcoin blockchain doesnt lie.

Like Atomic Swaps on the Lightning Network, is an example of an unexpected emergent utility that was completed recently.
I expect we will see all kinds of emergent properties pop up as the economy system gets used to this most recent build and begins smashing ideas together that segwit allows us to do.
The farther and farther Bitcoins ecosystem goes down the Segwit road the more difficult it becomes for non segwit coins to copy and paste its open source source code. Remember Bcash isnt segwit compatible.

At this point very little in Satoshis, but the ones who started a node are getting a fee, albeit very small.
The thing is we cant predict all the ways LN node operators will be incentivized and able to profit. For example, who could have seen Bitcoin holders getting Bitcoin Gold and Bcash as a reward for investing. (Just an example)
Early LN adopters will be rewarded in ways we will only know after its happening and everyone's wishing they spun up a LN node with something like 0.1 BTC in it.

Belcher you said
"Running a full node doesn't do much"  Could you elaborate if you mean it doesnt do much for the individual, or the bitcoin community as a whole?
I thought just running one will contribute to making bitcoin stronger for everyone. No?

What if another 50 thousand went up? And spread globally?
Finally which country needs new nodes the most?

I am very excited for Bitcoin 0.16.0! As of this morning Github showed it at 96% complete and I feel it will be one of the biggest milestones in Bitcoins history.
Its actually called The Segwit Wallet on Github and considering the epic 2 year struggle we won for Segwit after the UASF, we got Segwit in August 2017, this one change let evolve to Bitcoin 2.0 and now 6 months after Segwit was activated we are getting Bitcoin 0.16.0 which is uses  Segwit by default on the GUI.
This is huge and will greatly encourage Lightning, side chains, root stock, and Atomic Swaps and all kinds of goodies that we can't even imagine yet.
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:55:52
Right now? We will see an increase once 0.16.0 is released and then given some time for users to start using it.
But it will impact the Segwit adoption rate and put added pressure on other organizations like Mycelium wallet to implement Segwit. It will also help other Bitcoin wallets learn how to implement Segwit.
Also another major uptick of Segwit adoption is the news from Coinbase a few days ago stating they will implement Segwit in "the next few weeks" that will be huge and after that Bitcoin will never have the same fees we saw in December again, unless we have even more transactions than we have ever seen before which is a good sign, and ideally lightning network will help eliminate that.
Coinbase could also implement Batching of orders.... These things save everyone money even people not using Coinbase or bitcoin 0.16.0 because it decongestants the main chain for everyone.
Of course you will get an even cheaper fee if you send from a segwit wallet (Trezor for example) and even more if the other person who is the reciever uses a Segwit Wallet too.

Possibly the biggest fear that the US govt will somehow try and BAN Bitcoin has been assuaged with things like approval Bitcoin futures trading on the CBOE.
In the last year, especially the last 6 months we have seen the Bitcoin ecosystem grow more than ever before. People are writing books and speaking at conventions, people are making a living running YouTube channels dedicated to Bitcoin. People are making a living with Bitcoin ATMs or facilitating the need to buy sell and educate about Bitcoin, in much higher numbers. Universities offer real courses about Blockchain.
And of course the ecosystem around mining has grown immensely. Creating jobs and benefiting companies who make  graphics chips like Nvidia.  Samsung alone has invested massively into the Halong miner. The list goes on.
The ecosystem around Bitcoin has become a integral part of our economy and in another year will be responsible for a A LOT more economic growth.

A lot of alt coin market cap is moving into Bitcoin during the last month, showing investors are becoming more educated in what they are buying.
The odds are Bitcoin will eventually absorb BCH market cap.
But for the 45ish days of it becoming very unprofitable to mine BCH its possible Bitmain dumps more money into hashpower to prop it up. Yes they have a war chest....But Bitmains objective is profit not supporting BCH, and if Bitmain becomes a publicly traded company then fiduciary duty will make it even less likely for a few  ad actors in Bitmain to recklessly hemorrhage cash to support BCH.

We never had so many people making over $100K profits. This amount of money gets noticed in the bank, so it's worth it to pay the tax....especially when they made over things like 1800% returns.
I'd pay it becuae I do not want to lose that money.

Thanks Wolfwolz.
The OP remind me of  those memes that says "When Bitcoin is ready, you wont need to sell it",  its hard to conceptualize how fast the space is changing now.
To answer your question, yes I \(and Im sure many others\) are considering the option of never having to sell into fiat.
Its very likely Bitcoins ecosystem will evolve and grow to a point where we are getting paid in forms we haven't thought of yet, aside from hard forks.
Its exciting to watch this unfold.

I agree, where I am the older ATM are being updated with buy and sell Bitcoin ATMs.
And the limit for a no KYC transaction is pretty high.
They are every all over my city now, so the rates have come down due to competition and a drop in the cost of the initial investment.
An interesting note, is Sunday mornings (most ATM locations are closed, so the ATMs that are open early often have a line up exotic dancers  finishing tbe night and depositing into Bitcoin.
 I discovered this by fluke 2 years ago, one Sunday morning whe  I went to buy $40, worth of BTC and was watching all these woman deposit  rather large stacks of $20s into the machine.... That day was an eye opening experience regarding just how huge Bitxoin is and gave me the confidence to invest more aggressively into Bitcoin.
Gratitude!

But what happens well you sell Bitcoin for a nice gain and it just doesn't come back down.... That was the normal for the last 4-6 months of 2017.....
Im not much of a trader but do traders buy back in again at a higher price in a bull market?
PS I agree 100% that the price of Bitcoin will come back up, regardless of how far it drops. For 9.5 years with 100% accuracy BTC has always broke above the previous all time high price and gone way above it, over and over for nearly a decade. This recent time will be no different, in fact the run up might be even greater than the last run, because thats been a pattern too..... That give us 150k Bitcoin easy, because we ran over 2000% on the past bull run. Assume $6500 was bottom we get $130k bitcoin so I'd say we see $150k for a week but maybe touch $175k for an hour or so like the way we touched 20k for 15 minutes but 18k was the price for about a week. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:16:26
I agree that its not ok. There is healthy competition and there is also fiduciary duty, and this literally puts the BCH interests before the clients needs interests.

Just remembering this post when BTC passed 20 Billion market cap. It felt like such a milestone, and now roughly 75 days later the market cap is 25 Billion USD.......
Maybe the desire of not rising too fast in the original post has changed. I based on establishing support to reduce volatility. But Ive learned both 20 billion and now 25 billion market caps are great and the larger the market cap is an indication of growing adoption and ecosystem.
All the while the blockchain network is updated often. The BTC of today is not the same BTC of 8 years ago. Bitcoins network has updated most recent upgrade was released 2 weeks ago on April 22 2017. I will provide a link, 0.14.0 was the newest system update by bitcoin core which everyone has always been able to contribute to for nearly 9 years since the start.
So 0.14.0 to 0.15.0 is a major upgrade and those are released about every 6 months, and smaller upgrades like this most recent one is from 0.14.0 to 0.14.1 as I have read these updates to the network are updates to 0.14.0 and when 0.15.0 comes out similar updates like 0.15.1 and/ 0.15.2 are released but are often ways to make bitcoins network more robust and more secure. But this 0.14.1 invloves Segwit integration even for clients and miners who dont support Segwit. Im so happy to see this.
Here is a clip from this link
"This 0.14.1 allows non-segwit miners to continue functioning correctly even after segwit has activated" that part alone changes everything.
SEGWIT is mentioned a lot more and some other updates. Also discusses the date to expect 0.15.0 which is expected to be acitive (not testing) early September 2017.
Here is the full link to bitcoin core upgade made available 2 weeks ago on April 22....and its being used, bitcoin core has been consensus based since the start, it creates code writers and conputer programers who are not working for a paycheck, a programmer who believes in the project, have cohesion and can share ideas ideas with different departments, with our wanting recognition or credit for the idea. This team passion reaults in emergent leaders. COMPARE THIS PROGRAMMER to some alt coin who hire a programmer on a contract basis. They collect a pay check, they wont share ideas with different department's for no extra money or work for free. Or live, eat, sleep the project.
Get involved with bitcoin core. Visit the website bitcoincore.org to see whats really happening with bitcoin on a site that has no adds and is a direct descendant of Satoshi Nakamotos white paper.

@_date: 2017-05-09 17:20:23
Regarding scaling to Segwit for BTC, you know that about 15 days ago this bitcoin network update was released. Notice all the implementation of Segwit, and how it lets non segwit miners still mine without segwit if they want...heres a link ill post. Then when the next major network upgrade 0.15.0 comes online sept 1st summer, we will see some major changes. The roadmap is all on bitcoincore.org One of the most useful sites around. Heres the latest update, this is not next major network upgrade 0.15.0 just the recent 0.14.1 these are smaller and more often released. But this one has Segwit all over it.

Core kept bitcoin going when every mainstream media declared them a trend that's dead.
But Bitcoin Core used Githib and Slack and probably other ways to let the entire community involved. From suggesting ideas and making dates very clear when the deadline for any new suggestions are before they begin the next update to the network.
More than listening ideas, if you can contribute your skills in code writing or even code reading to look for bugs there's ways for all to be involved.
It's amazing how success makes some people hate you.7 years of Cores effort and the last 12 months  have really been fruitful. Yet everyone and their dog can do it better.
Thank you Core team. Thanks for changing the world. Thank you for making so many lives different and most of all thank you for remaining on the ball when everyone seems against you, despite THE BTC price over  $2500. 
It may seem thankless, but many many believe in you. It's hard to be  especially with something so disruptive

Yes absolutely. You can send  between Segwit to non Segwit and non Segwit to Segwit back and forth.

I bet its testnet only, or another example of what we were told in October.
We have the right to choose so many other wallets now, Mycelium isnt doing us the favor, they need us.
Adding Segwit is just doing their job, to avoid losing market share, they are not doing some big favor.
PSA- There are other wallets that have had Segwit for months already, because they are hungry to get ahead in a hyper competitive market.
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:48:48
So true.
Selling Bitcoin to buy it back cheaper is how the thought process started for lots of people who sold at a loss during in last 4 months...When they sold and  price dropped even further people talk themselves into waiting for it to go lower and lower before buying back in, or the money was spent elsewhere... Ultimately ends in the classic buy high sell low tragedy.

I rarely post videos but this guy Jimmy Song makes good content and is a developer. More importantly as far as I know he is one of the very few youtubers who has never been a shill for some alt coin or scam.
In fact his videos regularly  warn and educate people about avoiding these charlatans that have flooded the ICO space. 
From everything I've seen Jimmy Song highly values Bitcoin staying as decentralized as possible. He has developed and contributed as an actual developer including new BIP's
This kind of thing has earned my respect. 
I'm no expert, and he is not perfect. But in a time when almost all the content and news creators about Bitcoin and crypto is making awful content Jimmy stands apart and has a very informative quality YouTube channel. After Andreas, Jimmys channel Offchain is one my favorite YouTube channels, and the list of youtubers or news sites  I'll watch has become incredibly short.

I can say that in Montreal real estate for is changing from a sellers market to a buyers market.
Just from the summer to now the change is very noticable. We never, never saw listings have price reductions like we are seeing now. We are seeing 10% reductions in listing prices for the first time.
And it correlates perfectly with the recent stock market drop. The psychological impact on home shoppers is huge, consider it someone just lost 15% of their investment portfolio they are much less likely to spend more freely when buying a house.
Compared to that same person who had huge gains in the markets. Its easier to convince yourself to buy a more expensive house than needed when the ETFs Apple and Amazon are going up every day.
Now the language used by Fed ex about global slowdown in 2019 is important. Shippers like Fed Ex are a really good metric of economic activity. Fed ex stock chart went down so much and so fast it looks bizarre. Even when you zoom out past 1 year, 2 years even 5 years, the chart actually looks unusually odd, the drop is that drastic.
To conclude congrats to anyone who kept cash or Bitcoin on the sidelines. If your going to make a big purchase like a house you are better off as the  buyer today than 4 months ago, and it will likely be even more of a buyers market. For both stocks and real estate.
Bitcoin is such a good hedge, some people will learn this the hard way.

I feel Bitcoin ATMs have helped Bitcoin massively.
They provide a very easy on ramp for people to buy and sell Bitcoin. But also the advertising effect  of people seeing all these Bitcoin ATMs popping up has increased awareness massively.
Sure there is a price premium, but the quality and ease of use of ATMs has gotten so much better in the last 18 months.
And regarding the price premium, we are seeing the commission come down because of so many new ATMs creating competition.
They work, they work well, they are creating jobs and have been massive in building awareness.

It's a great great idea.
And if you get a tip, why not tip it to someone else.

And they will probably start happening in other forums and sites  too. Why not?
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:06:11
The motivation isnt based out of greed (mostly), my first LN tip was 20 sats and it helped me see LN in action, so I want to begin to tip other people...its a great way to inspire the network effect.
I promise you that a 20 sat LN tip motivating me to download and learn to use my first lightning wallet was not based in financial greed....20 data is not even 1 penny.
After reflecting....there is a level of greed. Not for the tips but the idea of helping Bitcoin become more useful and valuable. Every new person learning about LN and tipping can make all of us more wealth.
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:12:56
Me too.
Every ATM has the Bitcoin logo on them, and is at the very absolute least a way to advertise.
People see them and ask what they are used for? what is Bitcoin? This Bitcoin thing seems to be getting more popular?

Over a 2 year period Bitcoin has done far far better than the S&amp;P 500 or FANG stocks. Even after the Bitcoin crash of 2018,  Bitcoin still outperformed stocks, real estate, gold.
I'm almost  sure any 24 month period Bitcoin has outperformed every other investment class massively, like dominated.
Almost every 18 month periods are also dominated by Bitcoin. 
Even by far Bitcoin outperformed most 12 month periods.
But during every bear market people said all kinds of fear based things about Bitcoin. Other people accumulated, one guy I know well bought Bitcoin constantly during the 2014 bear market, he started buying at the top and kept on buying the whole freaking way down. Literally bought at $1000 and kept buying the whole bear market and  into the bull market.
His family said he was wasting his  money. His father especially

Also, before the difficulty drops, the existing miners have a greater chance of finding the next block it will just take longer to find it.
Since there are less miners so despite longer block times, the odds of being a rewarded miner increase.

First, you are doing the right thing by spending time researching and learning about how to store your Bitcoin. This one thing makes all the difference.
Second, the good news is storing your Bitcoin has gotten a lot easier in the last 2 years or so.
A hardware wallet is simple and effective...No need for some extremely technical plan. The Trezor is what  I'd suggest and I know plenty of people using the original Trezor who are very happy with it. I'm sure the newer Trezor is great but it's so new that everyone I know  with. Trezor still has the original model.
If you get a Trezor it's easy to use, but your confidence will go up if you do a few transactions from one address to another just to get some experience. These can be very small amounts, but jts helps you see how long transactions take and what it looks like. It will cost you less than $1 in fees to send Bitcoin to yourself a few times, that $1 in fees is well worth the experience you get.
Finally, above all else...The recovery words are the most important thing! Those words are how you get your Bitcoin if you lose the Trezor somehow. 
A new Trezor comes with a piece of paper to write your recovery words on. It says Trezor on it and makes it obvious that those are your recovery words....I'd suggest a regular piece of paper that doesnt reveal what those words are for.
The Trezor is the answer....And just as you are doing your research now you can focus the research on how to use the Trezor...They are easy to use but were taking about money and it's good to be comfortable using it.
@_date: 2018-12-23 07:07:39
I disagree.
I think percentage of Bitcoin transactions is a better metric of how many people are using Bitcoin with Segwit enabled.
Percentage of total Bitcoin moved could be just a few people who happen to be whales moving a lot of Bitcoin around with a segwit enabaled wallet.
Both are useful, but the percantage of transactions is more useful to gauge adoption IMO. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:03:18
Everybody should know that hardware wallets like Trezor arw very very easy to use. 
18 months ago a Trezor wasnt difficult to use, but they have become much easier for even total newbies and they focused a lot on being user friendly.
Also there are lots of tutorial videos out there to demonstrate how it works, (even though its simple) it doesnt hurt to watch a tutorial or two about Trezor.l, before you use it.
And to be safe make your first transaction a small "test" amount. Send $5 or something small. Then send $20 for your second transaction. Then practice sending some of those small test amounts to another wallet, probably a wallet on a cell phone. And then send from the phone back to the trezor. Wait and see you transaction get some confirmations, see how long it takes with 5 cents 10 cents and then with 20 cents. Play around and build confidence with small amounts of Bitcoin.
 It's a great way to build experience, even though it's already very simple.
Most important is to write your seed words down on paper when you set up the Trezor. Keep them in a safe place, and most people wont evem know what the words are for if they found it.
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:44:28

It's just depends on what we define as successful "adoption".
Anyone following Bitcoin the last few years can see that Bitcoin is already being adopted at faster and faster rates. A huge part of the population didn't even know what Bitcoin was just 2 years ago, now most people have at least heard of it.
Almost every metric we have shows Bitcoins network effect is branching out with increasing strength into all parts of the ecosystem.

IMO The interest in this topic is very underestimated.
There must be all kinds of useful ways that Bitcoin can facilitate buying or selling a home. Times are changing, even compared to 2016 there are much more real estate deals using Bitcoin, however the really disruptive applications and use cases are still not here.
Simple stuff like using LN to tip on people who help each other or share useful information about a home is a usecase. Like the tip bot we use here.
I'd happily tip someone in BTC who had a copy of something useful like an an old building inspection from even 30 or 40 years ago and they shared it with me.
Or any old documents that I can compare or simply cant findm, there's plenty of reasons to tip someone when home buying or selling. An app that allows this would be great... That's just an idea I thought of now while writing this. Obviously there are many more better ideas.
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:33:56
$100 or $50 the real gift to your future self is making the decision to get some experience and see how it works. This will leap you ahead of others who have never used /held Bitcoinat all before.
Odds are you end up learning more about Bitcoin and its ecosystem than if you never bought any at all.  Odds of trying a new wallet and moving $1 of Bitcoin to it goes way up and so on. The most benefits will be sharply slanted towards those with at least some basic experience, compared to zero experience.

The people setting up Lightning nodes today could be financially rewarded down the road in ways we cant forsee today. Not just fees but who knows how things will look in a year or three.
Nobody expected early adopters to get all that hardfork  money. It only emerged after Bitcoin matured. It's possible early Lightning adopters will get new emergent rewards as Lightning matures. It really pays to run a node.
Heck even the knowledge gained is valuable, lots of people weren't able to sell those smaller hardforks forks for more BTC because they simply didnt know how to do it confidently.
I dont expect it to be hardforks,  but I wont be surprised when early adopters get rewarded in ways that we cant forsee today.

Wow at how much Bitcoin has grown roots in Montreal.
Over the last 2 years the ATMs have gotten better and cheaper and the scene is strong. They even had the first Bitcoin Embassy.
I'm in Montreal often and have been noticing. In 2016 there were less ATMs available and it was early Sunday morning so most locations were closed. I found an open ATM and the line up was about 9 people long and I realized they were all exotic dancers or work in the adult industry just finishing a Saturday night shift. Putting all that cash into Bitcoin. That moment opened my eyes a lot to how many people have a use case for Bitcoin.

Wait till we start seeing news on TV about people fleeing war zones and the govt or thugs or army seized all their assets and bags of cash or gold when they tried to leave.
And these families here found a way around this by remembering 24 words. They sold enough Bitcoin for autos or Canadian dollars to start their life, or maybe converted it all to fiat.
But the middle class now has a way to get out of dodge without leaving all they worked for. This is why the middle class are the last to leave, they know they will lose everything. This is catching on....How can it not catch on.

For a smart phone there are several really good wallets, but a wallet on a phone is really just for small amounts, in my opinion. (But I've seen people walking around with large amounts Bitcoin on a mobile phone wallet before)
Green Address is an excellent mobile wallet

The economics of Bitcoin and mining are one of the real genius components of Bitcoin as whole.
Even if hashpower dropped massively blocks would be mined every 20 or 30  mins. That's all fine and the network will continue until the difficulty adjusts.
There is sooo much hashpower, even 2 years ago there was an incredible amount of hashpower. But the other reason a 51% attack wont happen is people  will just realize they are quite happy to make over 500 Bitcoin a day, and decide they want the price to go up.....its the economic beauty of this.
If they attacked in favor of some alt coin? It would be a fortune, insanely expensive and the price would come down massively for everyone including their alt coin. 
There are a bunch of other factors too. Bitcoins community has some really really top notch white hat and black hat folk who will probably retaliate.

I'd like to hear more about the recent agreement to upgrade from BOLT 1.0 to BOLT 1.1 specs.
It seems like within just  days of BOLT 1.1 specs being agreed on a lot more BTC started going into the LN.
Can anyone ELI5 the change from 1.0 to 1.1? Seems like these new specs made the whole network much more secure.

There are multiple projects being worked on in the Bitcoin ecosystem. So there would be multiple roadmaps, from people making better wallets, to better ATMs, to all kinds of second layer stuff.

One of the first videos showing this image of channels and nodes after LN went mainnet. It was made just over 10 months ago.
I was so inspired by how fast things were moving,
It inspired me to make the video. 
What a change from 10 months ago.
I'm posting this to help show the stark contrast of how different it looks today.  I'm glad I made this, it feels like a part of history now.

That is the first Lightning Tip I've ever gotten.
I'm grateful, this simple tip has motivated me to learn more about LN. I want to claim the tip, gotta learn how.
Now I can really see how  beneficial of these LN tips are. These tips act as a gentle nudge for people just like myself to play around, ask questions and use LN for the first time.
This is a very useful idea.

The smartest developers in the world are working in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
The smartest people always have an interest in learning and building together. We can see examples of this throughout history. And now open source is acting like a force multiplier.
These peopel chose the most interesting projects for a reasons other than only pay. They could walk into Google and get a great pay check anytime.
Heck some of them actually work at Google while contributing to Bitcoin in some way.

The difficulty only adjusts about every 2 weeks (based on what the hash  rate  is at the adjustment block) but the actual hash rate changes constantly.
Which is why sometimes it's less than 2 weeks to adjust or more. Or less than 10 mins per block or more.

Only 408 nodes when this was made. As I remember nodes were going up about 25-50 per day, so yep indeed it seems you got your set your node up literally a few days before this was made.
Assuming your node is still running today has there been any benefits  to being known as one of the early nodes to go up? Maybe more channels connected to you early on? Obviously you moved along the learning curve, that's an nice benefit.

With things built on top of Bitcoin, we will have the ability to refund scam or have the ability to get a refund when returning a product.
Bitcoin is decentralized, but entrepreneurs will be building all kinds of things on top of it that may be centralized. Coinbase or Shapeshift are examples,  but all kinds of things can be built on top of Bitcoin, its permissionless and sure many will be centralized. It's the most creative entrepreneurs that will do some amazing stuff.

It's important it get easier not harder for people to have open source gossiping copies of the blockchain.  I believe this is vital, and several modalities can be developed to do this...not just smaller blocks, more efficient blocks, and pruned or light weight nodes are examples of this. 
Its realistic to work towards having a running node on mid range laptop in just an afternoon.
Then eventually striving to have a copy of the blockchain that gossips with other nodes in real time up and running on a tablet on mobile phone. Maybe this would be a extremely pruned or light node, that works along side people running full nodes.
But a world where anyone with a cell phone can fully validate and not need to trust and be able to do this with ease would be a real real game changer.

Yes setting up Trezor is easy. They are designed for non techies like us. The Trezor is what made it easy for the common person to store Bitcoin.
Just save the recovery phrase...just like you would with the recovery words with Mycelium or BRD wallet.
The Trezor is as easy to use as BRD or Mycelium....its but much much more secure. Mycelium and BRD are mobile wallets good for small amounts.

I enjoy watching Bitcoin becoming more normalized within parts of our culture.
Today we have multiple TVs series or movies with Bitcoin in the content, Bitcoin being part of  commercials, plenty of books about Bitcoin. ....A few years ago this kind of thing was stuff members of the community discussed could happen but most only dreamed of it....It has been happening all along, and fast, but it looks slow because many of us are watching it all happen from so close.
IMO It really is a sign of adoption.

Really noob question, but this person created a Raspberry Pi Bitcoin node that  is not the same software as the Bitcoin Core nodes, is that correct?
Yet they valiadate the same blockchain, which is one way this different node software promotes decentralization?
Is that right, or is this a Bitcoin Core node running on a Raspberry Pi?

The algorithm adjusts to every 10 mins, but until it adjusts the time can go above or below 10 mins depending on more or less hashpower.
At every 10 mins the algorithm adjusts every 2 weeks.  This time it took about 17 days to adjusts because there was less mining power. When it adjusts it will be back to 10 min blocks again.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:22:18
With all positivity, maybe now is a time to look at the topic of this post started a few months back.
Surely " The benefits of not going up top fast" might be worth re visiting.
When we went from $1200 past $2500 in  a few days,  that it what i ment. However btc gained a lot of free press globally. And millions went into the ecosystem that wouldn't have. Heck there are more and more ultra rich diversifying into btc....IMHO BTC will surpass the all time high in medium to long term. Maybe evem short term because btc held those high longer than any previous all time highs

I feel the explosion of higher quality Bitcoin ATMs has really really helped adoption.
P2P services too, like Local Bitcoins and BISQ and Paxful.
And these services are still growing.
It's never been easier to buy Bitcoin, and without needing to show ID or anything.
The poorest were often the first refugees in war, as the middle class had wealth they didnt want to lose. People are learning they can use Bitcoin to safely relocate their entire lifes savings without risk of seizure.
Venezuela is just the start, wait and see in another year or 2 how much people use this tool. But if they are smart they wont talk about it until after they get out of  Lybia, Iraq or whatever hell they are in.

Trezor is excellent. And the people behind it have a good reputation.  For example the lead architect behind Trezor is known as Slush or Marek Palatinus.
Slushpool is one of the oldest mining pools and has a strong record of supporting the UASF, Segwit, the NO2X and Slushpool has continued to mine Bitcoin during times of attack when other miners were switching hashpower to mine Bitcoin Cash, Slushpool  mined Bitcoin the entire time.
If you read up on Slush you can see his technical knowledge are matched perhaps only by his values towards keeping Bitcoin decentralized and open source.
Trezor is open source. The product is excellent. Even the original Trezor 1 is excellent. I would order directly from Trezor.io but there are many other legit suppliers, but why not order from them directly.
Ledger Nano is a good product too. But its founders are related to Blockchain.info which means Roger Ver.
I would choose Trezor of Ledger based on that alone. Slush is a developer and has shown values that benefit the community. Roger Ver, well he's not a developer, hes a salesman and has helped Bitcoin by attacking it over and over making Bitcoin far more anti fragile.
I would pick the trezor hands down. Even the original version Trezor 1 still gets updates and is battle tested. The new Trezor model T I hear is great, but is more expansive.

As far as I know Venezuela is by far the largest example "so far" of a nation's citizens using Bitcoin to protect their wealth against runaway inflation.
Word will spread, people around the world will learn from this. The next hyper inflation crisis people will be more prepared, and more for the next.
Sadly this tragedy is effectively getting the word out about what Bitcoin can do.

Reversible (mostly) but your credit worthiness may never be the same, even years later a fraud victim is considered a higher risk to the algorithms and even people working at the bank.
Especially people who have been hit with fraud multiple times....they will never have the same credit rating as before....And if your private info is used for fraud once, I m pretty sure statistically the odds of getting hit with fraud a second and third, fourth time go up drastically. 
Eventually the victim might be looked at with mistrust by lenders. Identity/credit  fraud has gotten out of control, literally out of control. We all know someone who has been a victim at some point.

Bitcoin ATMs have been like steroids for adoption the last 3 years...
I remember seeing a lineup for an ATM Sunday m0orning around 9am about 3 years back. I was new and didnt realize most places with ATMs were not open Sunday mornings. Then I realized the 7 or 8 people in line (other than myself) were all strippers, or escorts or something in the adult industry....
Watching these women with wads of cash insert $20s into the machine is when I started to realize just how powerful Bitcoins censorship resistance is. Those girls were using Bitcoin as an offshore savings account. If they buy a house with it one day, sure pay the capital gains. But ATMs are game  changers and they are getting better and better. As well as other P2P exchange. 
That's how it seemed to me
Now think of all the advertising Bitcoin ATMs do for us, they are all over Montreal now and I've never seen KYC required. Soon the will be all over the world and everyone will have their own offshore account.

Yep old Montreal a very short walk from that famously old and beautiful church on Notre Dame.
Here's the site link. The rates change often but the site gives a basic idea.
 
 And when you go in person there's screens all over with up to date prices and the mempool and stuff. It's pretty cool, they are expanding to a second location I've heard.
A lot of people use them, and Im pretty sure the name Yap comes from the stone type money used on the Island of Yap which is described in the book The Bitcoin Standard. They sell copies of the book at this place are involved with meetups and stuff.
I've no real association to this place, but I will say I know lots of people who use them and have heard nothing negative. Similar vibe to what  the Bitcoin Embassy had.
Montreal is really taken to Bitcoin entrepreneurs....

150 isn't even close of enough to be considered begging. A bunch of tests could go through and if he kept them all he might bet 10 cents worth. And testers often send then back and forth to test sending and receiving.
Even when Bitcoin reaches 25K USD,  150 satoshis is still not even any real money. Its just enough to send test transactions.

I do want to have fully gossiping nodes on our phones, and even smart watches.
The idea of everyone, thousands of people being able to verify their wealth without having to ask third parties is vital. 
Every node assumes the others are dishonest. They are always verifying, with totally open source code.

Personally the hashrate was already really strong over 2 years ago. So hashrate increasing is less important of a metric for me to watch.
Dominance with market cap is really not accurate. 
Segwit adoption on the other hand is one of the most useful metrics we have to observe Bitcoin adoption and evolution. With Segwit we can do all kinds of things, it's not just more transactions per block. And a newer version of Segwit is in development....the fact that about 45% of all Bitcoin transactions are using Segwit in just over a year is a really good sign. It's speaks volumes for the whole ecosystem, and that includes Lightning, and all kinds of goodies down the road.

Bitcoin will keep disrupting, more people have learned about Bitcoin in the last year than all of Bitcoins 10 year lifespan.
No longer are the middle class preasured to be the last refugees to flee crisis zones because they risk having their lives wealth stolen/seized when they try to flee. You could put all your gold, real estate and fiat into Bitcoin and then have some wealth when you arrive in wherever your new home will be. 
People are learning this trick quick....just remember 12-24 words. 
OR put all your cash and jewelry in a suitcase and pray the guards, or militias or police or thugs wont steal it. This is a big part of why the poorest are the first to get out of Dodge when shit goes bad, they have no assets to lose. Unlike the middle class who spent decades working to save and build wealth and risk waiting until things get really really bad because they worry about losing all of it. The middle class in Iraq or Syria are examples of people who could have left years before it became hell. Now they have a new way to bring wealth with them.
Any creative apps or ideas that facilitate easier exchange of assets and fiat for Bitcoin in crisis countries for refugees would be a really useful opportunity.

The tutorials in YouTube will help....but good news, the Ledger is very easy to use. Still watch the videos and read the instructions (its money after all)
I'd suggest sending yourself a few test transactions just to get comfortable with how it works. Send yourself $3 worth of BTC or something small....the transaction fee is even smaller and absolutely worth the experience gained from this.
Bitcoin software? The Ledger has it's own software, it makes everything pretty easy to send and receive Bitcoin and store it safely.
Most importantly will be the recovery words you get. Those are the words you use in case you lose your ledger to recover the Bitcoin....So those are important, put them in a safe place.

Why process a block that's not full? Even a extremely low fee is something, heck why not no fee at all if there's room in the block?
At least fill the blocks right?
Then again, I'm no expert, I just thought of spammers bouncing satoshis around the blockchain for free to force everyone to pay more, or push the narrative for bigger blocks.

Years ago Japan was a clear leader in working to integrate Bitcoin into the country. Even after MTGOX collapsed which was based in Japan, they worked to foster healthy economic activity around Bitcoin in all areas. Including making Bitcoin a fully legal payment method early on, and creating jobs in the ecosystem that require specific skills.
Japan saw the chance to fill the niche early and went after it.
The surprise, is that despite Japan being so Bitcoin friendly the US is just sooo much more common than the Yen. People trade Bitcoin and USD all over the world but the Japanese Yen to Bitcoin is mostly in Japan.  If the Yen to Bitcoin pair is most common among all countries globally then I'm shocked. Because the US is somewhat Bitcoin friendly too, just Japan started getting serious a few years earlier.

This is a great idea. The real benefit is that this idea/concept is gaining more and more traction.
Jan 3rd is significant, but it's part of the larger movement which will continue to grow after Jan 3rd.
This has numerous synergies for the community, aside from helping the price go up. As owning your own keys gains momentum, so does the education level of the Bitcoin community, and the whole network effect grows.

That's decades away, over 100 years to reach the full 21 million.
But realistically as we get closer in the next 5, 10 or even 15 years the education and tech will evolve drastically. Probably to the point where ideas to help solve this problem get rolling.
We really cant even begin to imagine how Bitcoin will evolve over the next decade or so. It's really changing fast, and getting harder to lose coins and easier to recover from mistakes all the time.

They also have acted as an amazing advertising platform, getting people asking what's that thing?

It's getting expensive for Binance to replace those stolen Bitcoin....up about 18% since the Binance hack. 
7000 Bitcoins stolen and required to make clients whole is huge....likely they will be bought OTC, and spread out over time, maybe even directly from miners, but nevertheless that much new money will certainly increase demand.

Keep in mind that even if the hash rate dropped massively 50%, 70% that is still a heck of a lot of hashpower.
18 months ago the network was incredibly secure but had way way less hash power than this, not even 1/10th as I recall.
