That's not Bitcoin mining. That's mining other coins and being paid in Bitcoin (at their profit). And Nicehash actually got hacked recently, so it may not be the safest place.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:22:01
It's been many years since it was profitable to do what you're asking.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:56:31
You mean besides having your money stolen, and them taking a share of the profits when you could be mining alts directly?
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:59:37
That depends on your objective. Do you want to mine a coin that will make the quickest profit today? Or do you want to go with a coin that is easy to mine, so you can accumulate them quickly, but is less valuable today, in the hope that it gains value in the future?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:23:27
It's actually still in a long dip. The all time high is around $20K (a few weeks ago).
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:01:03
For what it's worth, I just had a BTC transfer go from Gemini to Kraken in 25 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:09:41
Too bad Gemini only does BTC and ETH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:21:24
Oh, and they also suspend deposits and withdrawals on a whim. Good luck ever getting any IOTA out of there.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:10:56
You can use a wallet app on your phone/tablet or on your computer.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:17:38
Gemini is sort of half way between Coinbase and GDAX. The nice thing is that ACH transfers are credited instantly. But the downside is they only support BTC and ETH.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:48
They just want to make sure they have your money first. If you want an instant buy, use a credit card.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:32:20
You can also buy with a credit card on Coinbase. The really nice things about that is that it's instant. But don't spend money you don't have.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:26:31
Coinbase sent out the same thing a few minutes earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:05:45
I transferred my BTC from GDAX to my wallet last night with no fee and it was totally confirmed by morning.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:58:35
You used to be able to, through a site called Sharebuilder. I own partial shares in several different companies. That ability seems to have gone away with their acquisition by Capital One, but it wouldn't surprise me if there was another similar service.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:10:18
The only catch is then once it's in your wallet you'll have to pay to get it anywhere else.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:46:32
Yeah, I'm investing in those through Wise Banyan and Betterment. But with Sharebuilder I could specifically buy partial shares of Netflix, Google, etc.

If you have an Android device, you can listen to that and a bunch of other Bitcoin podcasts with this free app:

I sold mine to pay off my GPUs and then my Block Erupter blade, and thought I was lucky for breaking even.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:23:38
Yes, but it may not be in theirs yet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:52
I was mining back in 2012. I wish I had actually kept some.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:09:03
Binance is horrible. You have to buy their special coin or else they take a tiny percentage of your trade for a fee, in which case you end up with .9 of whatever that they won't let you do anything with, since they don't deal with decimals on trades. And when it comes time to withdraw, they have minimums and high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:37:43
Ah, yes. The other advantage of using a credit card. :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:42:04
If it were me, I'd sell at least some now and then buy in again at the next dip. Make some money off your good fortune this week. (Actually, that's exactly what I did.)
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:31:05
Keep in mind that in the US, net neutrality laws have only been in place for a couple years. All the FUD around net neutrality going away is ridiculous. Did we not have a generally open Internet before 2015? What makes you think that would change? If T-Mobile starts doing nasty things, I'll just switch to another carrier, and they know that.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:42:36
If you think Coinbase's fees are high, I was just forced to pay Bittrex 0.001 BTC to withdraw 0.003 BTC. :(
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:39:16
That may be too low. But mine was much higher than necessary, it turned out.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:31:10
At your age, you might as well hold it for a few years and see if it will pay for college.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:04:51
With all the ping-pong today, it still hasn't gone as low as $6500.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:36:42
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:43:06
It's a lot easier to do with LTC and ETH, both of which I made a profit on today.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:29:48
According to this, yes, it's FDIC insured:
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:36:17
You may not want to cashout today.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:10:21
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:50:36
That was really strange.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:24:07
Technically the "bunch of words" is not the actual private key. The private key is a string of random-looking characters. The seed ("bunch of words") can be converted to the private key, but is only for convenience.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:29:28
Gotcha. So I guess you just have to be lucky to be on the exchange where it's obvious what's going on at the time. :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:37:42
GDAX only lets you buy in without fees if you can wait 4 days. If you want instant, and you're in the US, you just have to use a credit card with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:58:42
You start the bank transfer, wait 4 days (or more, depending on whether ACH or wire) for the money to show up, and then you can spend it. Or you can directly use your checking account for the purchase on Coinbase, pay the price at the moment you pull the trigger, and wait up to a week for the bitcoin to show up.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:42:59
Use Coinbase to get your USD in, then transfer it (for free) to GDAX to do further trading without fees (using Limit orders).
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:30:27
Right, the idea is to make the buy on Coinbase and then transfer the bitcoin to GDAX for further trading.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:28:36
The sale was about 2 hours ago.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:36:19
It's also accepted all over the Internet for small, every day type purposes. Does CNBC not understand you can spend a fraction of a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:19:39
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:30:42
The ads are served by AdMob, and the app has been in Google Play for 3 years. Actually, you might find the ads to be useful, since they're generally targeted at bitcoin users.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:25:51
And I sold at 7400 this morning. But I had bought on the dip earlier this week, so it's not too bad. Now to wait for another dip...
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:41:43
I usually do it when the price is rising, rather than falling. But that means it often goes much higher before leveling off. (For example, I sold at 7400 this morning.) Then when I think it's hit bottom I buy back - but often it ends up going even lower, at which time I might buy some more. But this means I have to wait and watch, which sometimes makes me very nervous.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:07:48
Maybe you should explain this to Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:15:55
You might be surprised at how big of a market they actually are - particularly Humble Bundle. That you haven't heard of them probably says more about you than it does about me. ;)
There are also many other online merchants that accept BTC. I work in IT and I've found that many places I buy from accept it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:54:20
A phishing website won't be very effective with someone who doesn't yet have an account.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:28:34
Otherwise, it will probably just get spent on quadcopters and Rocket League chests.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:32:49
Coinbase is FDIC insured for USD balances and they also have all digital assets insured.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:16:31
Reddit probably doesn't buy BTC. ;)
But if you're a US citizen, Coinbase is probably your best option to purchase, and then transfer it over to GDAX if you want to do any trading.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:35:32
And when I was looking for that picture, I found a wallet backup from 2013, and thought I'd import it on my phone and take a look. I see amounts like .85 BTC going in and out like they were nothing, and it makes me kind of sick. I've always thought my GPU mining barely broke even. Turns out it could have done a lot better if I had a little more foresight.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:27:45
You can set price alerts.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:34:52
Now is a better time than yesterday, but only if you think it will keep going up.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:49:26
Correct, your individual account is not insured against your stupidity. :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:49:49
Places where I've spent far too much over the last few years, actually. They are the candy stores for coin collectors and gamers, respectively.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:12:08
That message has been there for some time now. It's talking about the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin transfers are not instant - you have to wait a while.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:33:19
And that's why I just bought some below 7K?
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:07:48
This was mine, before ASICs. (Please pardon the mess.)
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:10:26


That's actually not true.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:48:12
Why do you say that? It looks like Coinbase/GDAX is not only cheaper but has more options for getting USD in.
Gemini also states they are not insured (other than FDIC on USD). Coinbase/GDAX insures all digital assets.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:32:27
Or sell just before the fork and then buy back when it dips afterward.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:59:36
My grandparents have been gone for some time...
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:28:15
Save a backup. Install the Bitcoin Cash wallet at
Import the backup. Once everything updates, your BCH balance will be there. (This is how I got mine out.)
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:21:47
Humble Bundle, Provident Metals. If I didn't already have a subscription that my boss paid for, I'd also use it at Commonsware.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:45:07
Cost: 1 week.
The easier way to do it is use a credit card to buy the BTC on Coinbase, and then transfer to GDAX to do trading with it. It will cost you a couple bucks, but you can do it instantly.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:30:57
That's what escrow services are for.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:14:43
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:40:22
You mean buying, right?
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:38:37
A 2% fee doesn't really seem all that outrageous.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:25:55
Depends on where they're being sent. You can transfer to GDAX instantly for free. If you're transferring to another wallet outside Coinbase, you pay the network fee and it takes as long as it takes. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:16:37
And crossed, and crossed, and crossed, and crossed...
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:02:56
You didn't say what country you're in. That can make a big difference.

Still under 8K on GDAX.

I can spend my BTC at Provident Metals and Humble Bundle just fine, thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:49:12
You do actually lose a bit in the fee that gets it there. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:01:36
Turns out you were right. There was a small dip I would have taken a couple hours after I went to bed last night.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:29:45
I still have a bunch of the USB block erupters and a blade somewhere in my basement. It's amazing to think that was 4 years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:25:24
1 satoshi will always be equal to 1 satoshi.
However, if you're talking about the USD value of 1 satoshi being stable from year to year, 1 USD one year is not even the same as 1 USD the following year.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:25:03


It doesn't matter what the exchange rate is if you're just buying it to use for transactions. The items you're buying are priced accordingly.

Some of us bought ASICs 3 years ago when they were affordable, but now they're also too slow, and the newer, faster ones are way too expensive for an individual.

This app provides news from many different sources, live and 30 day price charts, and it plays a bunch of different bitcoin-related podcasts. It's just a convenient app that has everything together.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:21:06
So how is this better than using a wallet app on your phone? I understand that this is more secure, but it seems like it would be a lot easier to lose/misplace (in which case security is a moot point). Or maybe I'm the only one that has a hard time keeping track of things like flash drives. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:16:34
If you happen to have an Android device, this app could be very helpful. It has charts, news, podcasts, etc.

GDAX/Coinbase seems to be the only real choice if you need to deal with USD. The nice thing is it's also insured against everything but your own mistakes.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:48:15


Huh. I've held my $37 test investment in Netflix and it's now worth $980.77.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:47:06
That's exactly how people contribute to their 401K (just not with bitcoin - yet).
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:18:31
And the same for GDAX:
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:02:36
Because they want to make sure they get the money from your bank first. If you can use a credit card, it's instant.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:54:29
It wasn't about Coinbase. It was about all exchanges paused for a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:18:26
I would just sit back and watch it grow at this point. Maybe even sell some to recoup your investment just in case.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:51:57
They must have seen my accidental trades for 1 cent when I meant .01 bitcoins. :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:19:54
That's why you put the USD in through Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:53:05
I think it needs to show more than just buys and sells. It doesn't show transfers in or out, which means you have no idea how much I made on a sell that I didn't buy in the same place.
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:54:45
It also needs to support Binance.
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:44:18
I wanted to try it out, but the new limit of 20 transactions for free and raised prices kind of puts me off. I need to be able to import data from more than one exchange, and make sure that works, before I'm willing to put any money down.
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:07:56
Reddit says this was posted 3 months ago. How did it go?
