Economic decisions controlled by a group? Sounds like oligarchy with extra steps

Most people don't know about bitcoin or have heard of it and don't know about it. A FedCoin could easily be made and if the government wanted to could ban bitcoin and make all sorts of false claims to manipulate the public into buying into their FedCoin. All the government has to say is it's new, faster safer technology etc.  Most people don't care and will just adopt it.

Thank you for elaborating on the risks! I think it's probably a good idea to stay more conservative then... I feel like the only things that could realisticly plummet bitcoin for good would be some sort of political intervention from world governments putting a restriction on the development of the currency. 
While it's still not wildly accepted yet in mainstream, it's still getting there. My main thing I wanted help with from this thread was the easiest way to access my bitcoin to pay for everyday things. I want more money in my bitcoin as it will just increase my "profit", when it starts to decrease (if it does)  I can sell it all and maybe lose a couple hundred at worst? 
But if bitcoin keeps rising like it has been, that means its getting more exposure, more legitimacy, and more demand which means it will raise in price. The profit I'd be making each month I'd use as cushion incase the currency would take a sudden turn for some reason. 
TL:DR, I really just want to know what's the best wallet for convenience of paying for everyday places and things that don't take bitcoin yet.

This is exactly what I'm thinking in all of it. I've decided to go with bitpay as they have 0 fees when using g their debit card. 
My take on it is, you're already entrusting people in a bank to hold your money, fundamentally cryptocurrency is superior to normal currency in every way and the only thing holding it back, just like all technological advances, is resources and government.  So because of those two risks I know from history technologically more efficient and more cost effective methods for the economy always always wins. As long as there's incentive to keep businesses and people into bitcoin, there will be growth until the market becomes mainstream with it. Reversing back to my point, we already give money to banks to hold our money. Why not have a bank that you have 100% control over the security of (which means it's not idiot proof), and gives you an unbeatable interest rate. The overall trend since it broke into mainstream and gained legitimate buying value, has been up. Bitcoin can't be stopped much like solar, much like many other technological advances, they all beg the question; "Not IF obsolete echnology will be replaced but when". And until I see that bitcoin has serious problems with entering more markets, I'm safe to say I can store most of my money in the bank of bitcoin where my money is working for me, but still is my money and is accessible. The more money inside the bank the greater the interest.

Let me re word it, bitcoin is different from a stock. I was simply wondering if there is any known risks to the currency itself failing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:27:26
Exactly my side thoughts, it's a race at this point. A risky race lying in the time frame of how fast bitcoin can outpace whatever the government tried to release. It's possible the government decides bitcoin is too big and adopts it into legal tender federally some how. Or kill it off and replace it how they did with gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:37:36
Can you elaborate? From what I've been researching, cryptocurrency sounds like the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:25:00
Valid points using: "history repeats itself". I hear you man, I pray that we don't see the day government shitcoin takes over. It's just any government regulations and altcoin will push back the progression of bitcoin immensely. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:42:24
I guess my question as a counter is, what are possibilities of it just crashing really hard anytime soon? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:49:04
Fuck the no people
They're giving you well rehearsed tips on stocks... 
If you look at the facts of what bitcoin is, and the main principles of what is driving it's success (whether it's big time players managing it to bring the price up, which they will only want to bring it up higher anyways)  or whether it's determined by number of users and popularity...  The outcome will still be the same. It's not near it's max amount it could be worth. The more it gets into news talk and gains users and real value and the better the technology gets such as implementing a lightning network capable of handling larger markets such as amazon...  The price will keep going up with each large corporation accepting bitcoin and each advancement...
At this point the only way it'd crash if the government announced a ban on bitcoin of some sort, mining pools dropped out in mass (also would lose them money making no sense), or if people stopped using bitcoin (which at this point it's very easy to see its turning into a snowball effect that we haven't dreamed of.) 
So really, with any stock trading you need to consider the REAL risks of it and calculate your own logic and unbiased opinion of the direction based on business decisions made by your stock (in this case bitcoin is our stock).  Bitcoin has a brighter future as over 98% of its success can be credited to the social media affect where more users and publicity means more value.  Which makes alot of sense considering it's a currency...  More people = More demand = More value... Since most large corporations don't accept it yet and WILL in the coming years, it has not hit even 20% of what it could become. It's so much different than corporations too because bitcoin hits an international market unlike we've ever seen and will continue to do so. It could very well become the first globally recognized currency which would be beneficial to business as well. 
The possibilities are endless. 
The real thing to worry about is once it hits widespread market stabilization, and becomes a normal currency accepted everywhere, the price will remain stagnant. (we are talking most likely a decade from now atleast).
I'm 19 and have spent the last few months researching what it is, and comparing it to normal ways of how we do run the economy and basic economic principles tell me it's not going anywhere soon. 
So TLDR watch some videos explaining what bitcoin is so you can stay up to date on news, use economics knowledge to help guide your decision making, and form your own opinion on what's going to happen based off news. (what I've been doing is watching for any big time news agency or investor, or any type of big exposure of bitcoin to the public is a time it's going to jump a good sum depending on what is happening.)  
Hope this helps

Bro honestly. No one knows if Bitcoin will ever rocket up again. No one knows if it will crash either. 
When crypto currency inevitably takes over the global population, it will be still controlled by governments of some sort. There's no way the government gives up that kind of control lol.
Edit: however block chain technology is here to stay. I think Bitcoin introduced the world to blockchain and the government will eventually try and most likely succeed in making a FedCoin and force it upon us citizens
