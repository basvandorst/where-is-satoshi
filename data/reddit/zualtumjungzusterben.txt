Somehow more is of course always better - but I also changed my lifestyle and found goo duse to my fiat, which is basically down to a black zero now :/

I'd like to say that I stopped moving fiat to bitcoin when any money I earned did not really change my bitcoin balance anymore. Yet I still keep buying to replenish the little bitcoin I actually use for transactions.

I move them like once in 3 years.... core wallet, multibit someday, currently at electrum, soon trezor or ledger... but basically full moves, no splitting or such. Electrum on an old laptop is almost as good as a hw wallet for now.

I was told it's important if I own the bitcoin privately, which might not be as easy to answer as it sounds. I'm confident mine are private, but whatever....

I'm in a very similar situation in germany. Spending some time and money with financial advisers now to make sure not to run into trouble. I just don't trust random internet advice on that :) Luckily I have old wallets, but those prove not too much either.
Edit: 
Here is my current knowledge about this. I'm no lawyer and no specialist on finance law. This is not advice but just what I picked up when trying to find answers.
The most important thing is, and that might be the problem for OP, to properly document how you gained your coin. If you bought it on the street for 2k€ it's nice if you have a 2k€ cash withdrawal at the time your wallet received 2k€ worth of bitcoin. If you just can prove that you got 2k€ in bitcoin and you get that from time to time, you might be suspected of having this as an income and thus having to pay income tax on them. And you would have to have a big enough income to be actually able to afford the purchase of the bitcoin at those times to make sure the money is considered clean. 
In Germany it seems you can sell your coin if you held them for &gt;1a. If you swap altcoins you had for less that 1a to bitcoins, you might have to tax the gain on them.

About the civil forfeiture: keep it in bitcoin, only cash out a little all the time, so there is nothing to rob.
