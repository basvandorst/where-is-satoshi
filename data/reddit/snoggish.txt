Yeah, *blockchain technology* is a huge advancement. 
What does that have to do with bitcoin though? Other blockchain technologies can pop up solving problems bitcoin can't. That won't necessarily raise the price of bitcoin.

Ok, cool. The good news is that it looks like the money (0.08768600 BTC) is in that wallet, so it didn't disappear. Bither might just be reporting it wrong, or it may need to update the blockchain. If you have the private key, you can import it to another wallet and access to all your funds.
I'd wait a few days and see if Bither updates, since the money's there according to the [blockchain explorer]( There also might be other menus in the app, maybe there are different views? Different hot/cold wallets you could be looking at?
Again, I've never heard of or used Bither before (I don't do mobile wallets, but it looks like it has good reviews), but a well-reviewed mobile alternative is Mycellium.

PBOC isn't happy with the measures those two exchanges implement, and either adds more restrictions or continues the ban on BTC withdrawals. Chinese investors who had money on those exchanges and were banking on being able to with their BTC either get fed up or panic. They sell all their BTC on the exchange and cash out, with plans to buy their BTC on another site like LBC, or hold cash until it gets sorted out. Such a large influx of coins being sold in a day can lower the price temporarily. 
The ETF doesn't get approved. People panic and lose faith in bitcoin because it missed this chance to gain acceptance and validation of one of the largest economies in the world. "Must mean the SEC saw something wrong with it. Let's sell for now."
I can make up fake scenarios all day, that's not my point. I'm not saying the price will for sure drop, I'm saying it's possible. Even if it does, it will be temporary. Yes, the ETF might get forgotten in a week if it's denied. That doesn't mean the price won't drop as a result.

What technical info is that? Still trying to learn about bitcoin, and I thought it was pretty hard to do reliable analysis on. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 05:20:33
I want it to be a currency. Right now, I'm treating it more like an investment for two reasons:
1. It hasn't replaced cash. I have very few use cases for actually *spending* pure bitcoin. It's just a store of value that I'll covert back to fiat if I need money, like gold. 
2. It's pretty volatile, although it's getting better. 
I guess you can see it as investing in another currency, like you said. But to me that still makes it an investment more that anything else.

IMO, I wouldn't put everything in BTC. Having some BTC is great, putting ALL your money there isn't. 
By posting on most people are going to tell you to do it. Answers are going to be heavily skewed towards "Yeah, buy and hodl all the bitcoins." I'd recommend asking the same question on and and take their responses into consideration too. 
Maybe put $20k in a retirement account, $10k in BTC. Even then, that's way more (33%!) than I'd be comfortable with, but you do you. BTC is a purely speculative investment, think of it like gambling. Yes, it can pay off, but you could also lose a lot of that money. I believe in it, but I'm not gonna risk my retirement by gambling in BTC just so I can save less. Only invest what you're comfortable losing. 
If you invest $30k in the stock market now, you can expect to have at *least* $300k to $400k by the time you retire. That's without contributing another cent. Compound interest baby!
Either way, if you do invest in BTC at all, I would recommend diversifying into other cryptocurrencies/altcoins so you don't have all your eggs in one basket. 
Tldr: Btc is too risky to put all your money in. It's cool. But has a short track record.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:15:52
This. As long as there aren't any other coins in your wallet. If that's the case, I think it might send those to the first address when it gets confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:35:35
Hahaha, yeah, it took me a few hours to muck through the documentation when I first started using BTC. Most of that was figuring out how to install Electrum on an offline live boot of Ubuntu, without being able to sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-pip while offline. 
Later, I found TAILS has electrum built in, if you trust the distro.
I used two flash drives. One with Ubuntu, one for the keys to transfer to my PC. You could also just use pen/paper I guess.
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:10:13
Where can you find the private keys to your Coinbase wallet(s)? I haven't found a way, and I think that's his point. 
Without the wallet's private keys you need to rely on Coinbase, or one of their products, to access your funds. I've heard many stories about Coinbase not letting people access their bitcoin for one reason or another. Or what if Coinbase is hacked? Or legislation gets passed and CB won't let you access your coin without more identifying information? What if they go bankrupt? Why risk it?
You can avoid all of this by transferring money to Electrum or another wallet if you plan on holding it. It takes maybe 10 minutes if you're just starting out. What's the risk there? Coinbase is a great exchange for someone new to bitcoin. It's fast, easy to use, and has some nice features. I'd never store my bitcoin there unless I plan on using it soon. The reasons above aren't a big deal if you plan on using the BTC within a few months. If you plan on holding it for years and years it's safer to use a wallet only you have the private keys to.
@_date: 2017-02-02 02:11:04
It's because you opted to pay the lowest fee. Electrum recommends a fee, use that.
Lower fees = longer confirmation times
@_date: 2017-02-02 19:44:56
Yeah. The IRS is saying that Bitcoin trading is the same as stock trading. If you sell a stock, you need to pay short or long term capital gains tax on the earnings, or get a deduction if you had losses. 
They want the same taxes on people who exchange bitcoin for fiat. I think any purchases too, but am not so sure about that. 
They're going with coinbase because it's a huge exchange. So yes, you might have to do that if you've sold bitcoin for cash. In reality, the IRS is probably only going to go after the big fish, but they did ask forgot *everyone's* data. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 17:18:28
For free downloadable computer wallets, Electrum is great for new users. Make an offline wallet and you should be good.

I don't think loaded/unloaded matters. The only value is the collector value. 
Nobody will buy it for the bitcoin because you also have had access to the private key. They'd need to trust that you aren't trying to screw them. 
Edit: Derp. Apparently there's a sticker that makes it so nobody can tamper with it. I was thinking of different physical bitcoin coins.

I agree that BTC would be a helpful hedge against corrections like the one we had in 2008.
Take this next bit with a grain of salt. BTC adoption is growing more every day. The more stores that accept it, the less the following argument matters. (Aside from food storage, always have food stored. Eat what you store, store what you eat.)
I disagree that it would be useful of in a hyper-inflationary scenario or something akin to the Great Depression. Few enough shops accepet BTC now. Why would they suddenly switch to accepting it? Sure, cash may be next to worthless, but now you've got to be a BTC salesman. Given the low levels of current adoption, I think it'd be more prudent to store items that you can barter. First aid, canned food, solar chargers, even tampons. I think bartering with something people know and recognize will be easier than bartering with some ephemeral digital currency people may not have heard of before. Instead of needing to buy food with BTC, you already have food stored.
Shop owners may be afraid to accept it because *they* don't know who else will accept it. You could be trying to buy his stuff with Stanley Nickles for all he knows.
Even then, you need to pay for internet, electricity, and/or a cell plan, to use BTC. Your BTC may let you pay for these things. But to trade, you'll also need to find someone who still has these these things too.
I, like you, am holding BTC as part (~1%) of my retirement plan. I would recommend talking about this with your financial planner, he might have some insight... but he might also try to sell you more stuff. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 14:46:39
Lots of people here will tell you it's a good idea, but this is the bitcoin sub, we're biased. Ask and take their advice into account too. 
If you have no savings, you should probably save that into a standard cash bank account. Not sexy, but safer. The thing with rainy day funds is that you don't know when you'll need the money. What if you need $300 for car/medical repairs, but bitcoin just took a 10% dive? 
Remember that savings are for a lot of life events. College, books for school, vacation, weddings, house down payments, etc. Bitcoin can be a part of your plan, but diversification is key. No one asset class (be it bitcoin, stocks, bonds, real estate, gold) should make up all of a portfolio. 
Talking in other terms, this is like asking if you should keep your savings in the stock market. It's always gone up in the long term, right? Well, with emergency funds you typically don't have the luxury waiting until your investments have done well to withdrawal. Bitcoin is even more volatile than that. 
Look at last year. What if someone had all their savings in bitcoin and bought at $800. Then, bitcoin went down to $400/coin, and they needed the money for an emergency. It doesn't matter that today they'd have a 25% increase in their investment. They needed to cash out when it was down at $400. They had to eat a 50% loss instead. 
If you want to get some bitcoin, I would recommend starting with only $10/week, and put the rest in a savings account. Get used to the technical aspects and volatility. I know it's not sexy or exciting, but bitcoin is still a speculative investment. Make sure you understand the risks. Knowing what I know, I'd never want more than 5%-10% of my wealth in bitcoin. With bitcoin, there's always the possibility you'll wake up with less cash value than what you had the night before. 
Personally, the only money I put in bitcoin is money I don't plan on using for the next 5-10 years *at least*. Rainy day funds don't have that time-line, since you never know when you'll need them.

Glad you liked it!
It can be profitable to buy Bitcoin with cash from a site like Coinbase, transfer it to an exchange like Poloniex or Kraken, and then exchange your Bitcoin for alts you think will do better than Bitcoin. Then, wait and sell them or convert them back to Bitcoin when the price rises. That's pretty risky, but it can pay off big. Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, are pretty speculative at the moment. I think it's closer to gambling than investing, but it's still super fun.
If you're interested in buying some alts to resell, check out and for more info. Just be careful, there are hundreds of alt coins out there, and some of them are scams.

Such a scam. Stay away, buy from a more reputable company/exchange (like CoinBase/cex.io/Kraken/Poloniex/etc.)
Setting aside all the other scammy parts, even the math is wrong:
They say they'll pay out at least $25/hour.
Further down:
They say they've paid out $162,215.
They say they have 30,623 members.

Your post makes a lot of sense, but for the analogy at the beginning I think bitcoin is more like the first snap *client* in the 80s. The blockchain is the technology.

My vote is Coinbase for small amounts. Super easy to setup, very quick buys, and they have decent security. You can buy with PayPal, CC, and bank accounts. 
If you want to store bitcoin for long periods of time, use a wallet you control (paper, offline, hardware wallets), don't trust the exchange.
@_date: 2017-02-16 21:39:33
I'd argue that if they have cash sitting in a bank account, it's not part of their portfolio. To me, a portfolio means investments. 
In that regard, I'd say bitcoin should make up *no more than* 5% of your total investments. Traditional stocks are much less risky, and tend to provide better returns for the and unit of risk, when compared to bitcoin.

That's a good point regarding capital gains. I'm sure the richer folks pay much more there than others. 
There are still CEOs and executives that make $200,000+ each year in salary alone. I think they'd welcome the removal of income tax. 
Furthermore, wouldn't removal of these taxes reduce funding for programs that traditionally benefit the 99%? Things like public school, Medicare, police, public defenders, medicaid, Social Security, etc.

Bitcoin is considered an equity (like stocks) and is taxed accordingly. But BTC doesn't pay dividends. 
You only have to pay taxes on bitcoin when  you convert BTC back to fiat (USD). You will  need to pay short/long term capital gains (or losses, if you sold at a loss). 
You *could* try to hide where your coins came from, like another poster suggested. But that doesn't help when you sell, unless you do it on a P2P exchange. If you sell $5,000 of bitcoin on Kraken/Gemini/Coinbase/wherever and have it sent to your bank account... You can bet the IRS might take notice that you got a large sum of money from an exchange. It doesn't matter how anonymized they were, they obviously belonged to you when you sold them. And you can bet these exchanges report that kind of stuff. 
For lower amounts they might not notice, but it's small so why not pay taxes? If you had a $500 gain (bought at $500, sold at $1,000) you'd owe $75 (15 % long term capital gains for most people).

If you want anonymous, you probably shouldn't buy bitcoin with you bank account/credit card at all. More on that below. If it's more for payment security (not giving out your cc info to a sketchy site), using bank/credit card to buy bitcoin is fine.
Coinbase is probably the easiest way if you don't really care about setting anything up and only want to use bitcoin once or twice. You can buy up to $50 of bitcoin instantly with just a credit card, no need for other personal info (at least where I live). They also accept bank account info if you don't mind waiting.
Gemini is newer and a lot of people like it, but I'm pretty sure you need to give them your SSN. Even though they're a registered fiduciary that's always kept me away. They also only accept bank account info, no credit cards. Bank account ACH transfers usually take 3-5 days to get confirmed.
If you want to buy something without using your credit card AT ALL, you can go to a site like LocalBitCoins.com. You can buy a physical Amazon gift card at almost any store, then trade it on there for bitcoin. Make sure to look at feedback, reviews, and blocks of anyone you think about buying from. The costs are pretty high (around 20% above market) because of the extra risks for sellers there. (You can tell Amazon that your giftcard was stolen or doesn't work, and they may refund you and deduct it from the seller's account.) Higher fees, but more anonymous. ATMs usually have lower costs than that method, but are harder to find.
Some credit card companies offer "virtual credit cards". Card numbers you generate, tied to your main account, but with different numbers, expiration dates, and CVV codes. You can use one of those with sketchy sites to avoid some of the risks of overcharging.
I think there's something simlar for bank accounts (called Private or something) but I've never used it.
@_date: 2017-02-11 14:48:18

TL;DR: According to his model, a $100,000 bitcoin is possible if bitcoin takes 20% of gold's "store of value" market. No explanation of why he thinks that is possible. He also said it's likely (using the same model) that Bitcoin will stay at around $550 for the rest of the year (2015).
I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who agrees that may happen, and their reasoning.

Do you have the transaction ID? Only if you want to share it. That's strange it's not showing up on any blockchain explorers. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 19:45:24
The address above (16zq2mWupz7cgyX9P7wq5Pac1yECrBdkFn) is your public key. Anyone can view the transactions into and out of the address, along with how much BTC is in there.
A private key is what (ideally) only you have, and it's what lets you spend the money in that wallet. I can see you have 0.08 BTC in that wallet, but I can't spend or send it because I don't have the private key, but you do.
The private key is created when you make a new wallet, so it should be stored within Bither somewhere.
Here's more info about private keys from the wiki:
Here's a similar question on Bither's github. Looks like you get the private key by long pressing on the lock button, and going to advanced options.
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:14:20
I haven't heard of anything like that, it sounds like the full value didn't transfer. Is CoinBase showing $0? I've never had a problem transferring money from them, so it might be Bither.
If you're comfortable with it, you can post the transaction ID and we can investigate further.
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:49:10

@_date: 2017-02-07 01:44:10
Nope, one of the beautiful things of bitcoin.  
There's a transaction accelerator (many threads on the site about it). Use that and it might help... But why was your fee so low in the first place? Many wallets, like Electrum, use dynamic fees to avoid. 
A lot of people are having the same issue. A quick search and you can see what's worked for them. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:27:43
Not sure about Bither either. To check the transaction in CoinBase/post the transaction ID so we can dig in to it:
1. Go to "Accounts" in the menu bar on the left.
2. Select your BTC Wallet (That's the default bitcoin wallet in CoinBase)
3. You should see a list of transactions. Click on the one where you sent the ~0.009 BTC. If it's not there, that means you didn't send all of it and there should be some BTC leftover in your coinbase wallet balance, or you have multiple BTC wallets on CoinBase (unlikely).
4. When you click on that transaction, there should be a box that pops up with "To", "Note", and "Status" rows. 
5. At "Status," there should be a link with the confirmations (something like "X Confirmations") under the confirmation status "Unconfirmed/Confirmed." Click the link
6. That should bring you to btc.blockr.io with your transaction information
7. Copy the URL and paste it here.

That doesn't mean another opinion, from a financial professional, isn't warranted.

@_date: 2017-02-12 17:08:47
Yup, totally agree about getting other viewpoints. And I live in the US, so that's where most of my advice comes from.
It all comes down to what level of risk you're comfortable with. Personally, I wouldn't buy BTC now and plan on cashing it out in 4-5 months. IMO, bitcoin's biggest upside comes after holding it for years. That timeframe is too short for investing in most bonds, which are considered by many to be the safest (and lowest yielding) investment.
I would see how much cash you'll need in the next few months to a year and plan out how to make that happen. Are you covered by your income? Do you need to save extra? How about other bigger purchases? You don't want to miss out on a downpayment because bitcoin took a dive. 
Any investments, bitcoin or otherwise, shouldn't be cashed out for at least 5 years in order to get the most benefit from them. I would only buy bitcoin with whatever money you're comfortable not seeing for the next few years.
I'd also consider diversifying your investments as mentioned earlier. Maybe you decide you can invest $50/week and not miss it. I would recommend splitting that up into stocks, bonds, and bitcoin. That way you aren't totally screwed if one of them takes a dive and you need the money.
This flowchart may be helpful, but again it's US focused and was made by the folks over at @_date: 2017-02-12 15:10:31
Maybe a silly question, could you reformat your hard drive and avoid paying the ransom? 
Also, do you know how this got on your network?

Thanks for the video! I just watched the whole thing (25+ minutes). 
When he's using his model, the only time he mentions BTC climbing that high is if it takes 20% of Gold's "store of value" market. He ends by saying his model predicts Bitcoin will  stay at $600ish for the next few months (in 2015). I tried to use their model, but it isn't working for me. 
Is it safe to say that you think Bitcoin will take 20% of gold's market share? (assuming his model is correct)

For credit card purchases, I've found that CoinBase has the lowest fees now that Circle is gone.
If I'm wrong, someone please correct me. Lower fees are always appreciated.

The difference in (market) price between when you received it to when you sell it is what you should pay in short term/long term capital gains. Which one depends on the time period. 
Personally, I'd start the clock when you were gifted the new replacement coins. No need worrying about the theft, the coins weren't insured, they're gone. Someone else gave you the same amount because they were nice. Two separate events imo, but I'm not a CPA. 
Most tax programs have a spot for gains/losses so that shouldn't be a problem. 
I don't think it matters if you don't know who sent them to you.

So it's been one day? I've never heard of anyone evaluating investment decisions based on what the market does in a single day. 
Awfully quick to rush to judgment.

For me, it's less of "I should buy because it might go up" and more of "It's not a great time to buy." I don't have a ton of money to put into BTC, and I want to wait for the right time to buy. The price may never get this low again, or it might crash tomorrow because of some new legislation. I'm going to wait and buy when it drops again, because it will drop again, it's just a question of when and how much. Or more accurately: I'm going to buy when it starts going back up AFTER a drop, instead of buying now. I plan to hodl for at least the next 3-5 years, and am willing to take some losses now. 
I think the conflict with SW and BU could get worse (and lead to people losing faith, price dropping, etc.) before everything gets figured out. That, and cryptocurrencies are coming under more scrutiny from various governments. i.e. the announcement from China earlier this month that brought the price down a hundred dollars or so. I don't believe that any of that will stop BTC, but it could lead to panic selling, which in turn can cause a drop. No clue about what price it could drop to, though. I'd just be guessing. 
Pure speculation: I wouldn't be surprised to see $800 again within the next few months. But again, BTC is something new and it's hard to tell where it'll go; there are so many factors. This is the reason only 1% of my overall investment portfolio is in cryptos. The rest is stocks/bonds/real estate. 
I could be wrong. My thinking comes from life in personal finance/investing, and BTC isn't a stock or a company. That's why I'm buying small amounts regularly. :)

I've wondered the same thing. I don't think Bitcoin could function at all. By its very nature, it needs electricity and an internet connection to work. Anyone without an internet connection wouldn't be able to spend their BTC. If people with an internet connection kept mining, anyone knocked offline for days/weeks/months could hop back online and resync. 
But BTC wouldn't be usable during any situation where the internet went down. I can't see how that'd work, probably better to stock up on food/water. To prepare for a situation like this, having your keys in paper/metal would be a good way to make sure you still had access when you have an internet connection.
Either that, or we all get really, really, good at mental math and have a lot of paper.
In any end of the world type scenarios where the internet still exists (financial meltdown, depression, etc.) we'd be good.

What ever came of this? Did you get sorted out? Wondering if everything got resolved. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 02:45:45
Site is not very intuitive. Can't even see the buy orders.
For that matter: How does someone buy something off this site? There are only sell buttons.
Smells fishy to me.

I use the money I get from odd jobs/freelancing to buy some bitcoin. I think it's (currently) easier to earn money a traditional way and then convert it to BTC. You could check out sites like Upwork, Fiverr or Freelancer and see if there are any gigs you might like to do. 
Mining and the like is too much hassle for what it's worth, imo. 
You also might want to check out or look around for various side hustles. Bitcoin is a very speculative investment right now, but it's becoming less-so every day. For that reason, I often don't spend money from my day job on it.
@_date: 2017-01-30 02:41:45
I set up weekly/monthly buys like this when it's steady.
I only buy large amounts when the price drops significantly, not when it's steady like it is now.
@_date: 2017-01-31 01:14:44
Haha, yeah, exactly. Personally? Yes, I think it will drop below what it is now, but I don't think it'll stay there. Even if I'm wrong it won't mean missing out on *that* much money because of the biweekly purchases. They help me combat fomo, lol.

I was explaining his point since ~~you~~ the person I was replying to didn't respond to it. I don't have an opinion one way or another when it comes to BU vs SegWit. I honestly don't even know whose side Roger is on, nor do I care. If there's a problem with an idea or solution, I want to know what's wrong with the *idea*, not the people who support it. Not really sure how "Been chewing the Roger nonsense today eh?" adds any value.
I came here to learn more about the different sides of the debate, and you've greeted me with ad hominem attacks. Well played.
With that being said, I think that "Suggesting that it took 'too long'.... is nothing short of ignorant FUD" is a vast understatement. 
Consider this:
1. Bitcoin is at an all time low market cap (68.3%)
2. People are more likely to sell when there's fear and uncertainty in the markets
3. Transaction times are also increasing dramatically.
4. There are many altcoins out there. Some are closer to implementing scaling solutions than Bitcoin seems to be, and others have done it already. Most have lower transaction fees and transactions clear faster than Bitcoin.
Therefore: The decrease in Bitcoin's market cap is due, in part, to the uncertainty caused by the scaling debate. People are starting to recognize that there are other alternatives to Bitcoin and are moving to them for lower fees and faster transaction times. If a scaling solution had been thought of sooner, this could have been avoided. Instead, Bitcoin is slipping.
Feel free to refute any points of that argument.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:25:14
So it's BUs fault that SegWit can't get enough support? 
@_date: 2017-04-08 02:38:59
Me misspeaking and saying market "cap" instead of "dominance" is pretty far from spreading FUD.
1. I meant "market dominance." BTC market cap isn't represented as a percent. 
2. I never said I was worried about volatility. I said, "People are more likely to sell when there's fear and uncertainty in the markets." Just because you and I aren't worried by volatility doesn't make my general statement false.
3. That isn't mutually exclusive, and I didn't mention fees in that point. A 30 sats/byte transaction fee *will not* be confirmed in as much time as it would have a year ago. Of course, pay an exorbitant fee and any transaction can be in the next block. Since you brought up fees... 2-3x the average fee in January 2016 (~30 sats/byte back then) is ***still*** significantly lower than the average fee today (~150 sats/byte). Source: 
4. No, altcoins don't need the scaling solutions right now. I agree. But that doesn't change the fact that some of them have done things that Bitcoin has is failing to do. Why stick with BTC when transactions Ethereum... freakin' *Ethereum*, not even a true currency, get confirmed in under 10 minutes for a $0.02 fee. And that's not even one of the alts that's implemented a scaling solution, it just has low transaction volume.
Yup, I agree Bitmain's being pretty shady with this ASICBoost junk

But they took too long to do it, without providing any intermediate measures. That's the point.
