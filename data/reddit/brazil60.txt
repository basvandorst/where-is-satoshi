Fuck the police

Shoot em an e-mail then. If you want your Bitcoin, let them know. You aren't the only one with this issue. Could be server delay too. It doesn't hurt to try.

I wound't say so. What drives the price is demand. People actually buying and selling Bitcoin. As long as there's more people buying than selling we will see a steady rise in price, but there's no doubt this is taking us one step closer to making it mainstream.

Those are some bold words.....It isn't the first time I've heard this though. The Bitcoin community has way more support and infrastructure though. It's hard to see BTC go down when there's so many more people working hard to make it a success!

Pls part of Bitcoin's future lies in it's adoptability. The technical barrier doesn't help the layman which is why I'm asking haha
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:21:44
Theses are the things I want to hear. I know we've been through worse, but the idea of Bitcoin stagnating is fucking horrible. 
What makes you think SegWit is more likely to occur now though? Miner centralization seems to be the biggest concern right now. How can we even trust these peeps?

I thought it was the 17th 
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:52:40
What is the meaning of this lol
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:41:08
Bitcoin hacked? 
@_date: 2013-08-04 02:08:12
I've been a miner for quite a while now. I just want to make an upgrade. 
@_date: 2013-08-04 02:10:36
What? 
@_date: 2013-08-04 02:06:38
That is a possibility, but BFL is a joke, they're shipping orders from a year ago still.

Intellect? I'm glad you have the ability to evaluate my level of intellect by my one sentence question. Congratulations. And asking reddit is idiotic? How old are you kid? And why the fuck do you care about my investments? I can't even tell if you're making a valid argument or just being plain stupid. Don't bother replying, you'll be wasting your time. 
@_date: 2013-08-04 02:05:41
Fuck you?
@_date: 2013-08-04 18:54:48
Yeah it's a scam.
@_date: 2013-08-04 02:18:05
Not sure what you mean bro. Can you send me a link by any chance?
@_date: 2013-08-04 06:19:48
