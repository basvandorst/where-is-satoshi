Let's be honest. Not even 1/3 of the 20k will move there. People, like me, signed many years ago because we supported the idea. Living in New England? Not even once.

It doesn't mean nothing but you would hope that NH could at least do something like legalize marijuana. If the state motto meant anything they'd be out ahead of other states who have already done so.

NH is beautiful country for sure. I just don't ever want to live so close to Boston or NYC or other huge east coast cities. Even Maine is more attractive to me than NH. But I'm just more of a wild west type of person. The east just really isn't my thing.

I've been listening to Ian Freeman for many years. I like him and his show. The "live free or die" state along with the free staters that already moved cannot even legalize marijuana while other states do. New Hampshire is a place where statists from New York and Massachusetts go to retire. It's not a wise battle to move there to try and counteract such a thing. A western or midwestern state would have made more sense for this project.

And you sound like an overly-emotional baby.  
For supporting the concept of the FSP, while not being willing to move there, and pointing out that western states are already pushing for more liberty than New Hampshire, you label me a sociopath. Stick your fingers in your ears and shout "LALALA!" more as you divorce yourself from reality.  
In another 15 years the FSP will be 30 years old and probably still lagging behind several western states in regards to liberty as it already is today. NH was a bad decision and calling me names does not change it.

Yeah playing football is a good analogy to upending your life an moving away from friends, family, and property. Not.

They made a terrible decision and should not be so gullible.

FED BTFO! How will they ever recover?

freemasons are just old farts playing dominoes. Rothchilds at least exist and are richer than anyone else.
