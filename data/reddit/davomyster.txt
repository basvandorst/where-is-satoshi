Here's the reddit discussion about this:

Advances in computing power is taken into account. If the world's most powerful supercomputer suddenly became 500 billion times faster overnight, it would still take around 3x10^41 years to brute force the entire keyspace for a 256 bit AES key. There are around 10^24 stars in the entire universe. That's 100 quadrillion times more years to break AES than there are stars in the universe! It's hard to fathom

OP was asking if there's anything that provides assurance that the code running on the device is the publicly-released code and hasn't been tampered with in any way. Is there? As far as I can tell, there is no assurance and there are several ways the code running on the device could be made malicious.

How do you know it's secure?

I'm not trying to criticize anyone in this thread but it's important to understand three things: 1) The fact that it works for you and you haven't heard of any reports of security issues does not mean the device is secure. 2) Storing the private keys offline doesn't make the system secure. The device may or may not do a good job at protecting the keys offline but the system could still be exploited when the device is connected to a computer to make a transaction or update firmware. 3) There are plenty of attack vectors for this system, or ways in which vulnerabilities could be exploited. This risk can mitigated to varying degrees by building security into the system through a variety of activities but as far as I can tell from a few minutes of googling, there is no publicly available record of any penetration tests, secure code review, architecture risk analysis, etc.
To be clear, I'm not saying this device isn't secure or that it's not the most secure. I'm saying that we have no assurance that it's actually more secure than any other solution and many people seem to have an inflated, false sense of security. This is at least partially due to exaggerated claims made on Trezor's main website like "all operations using TREZOR are entirely safe" and "everything can be audited by an independent third party. This ensures that TREZOR is absolutely transparent and backdoor free". Neither of those statements are true.
Having said all of that, I'm still interested in buying one because the risk associated with this device is probably acceptable for me when compared to other solutions.

Your Apple stock reference is a perfect example of a common investing mistake that's rooted deeply in human psychology. Of course it makes sense looking back that those who invested in Apple early made a smart decision which earned them a big payoff when they eventually sold it. Just like how you said it was a good financial move to buy "cheap" bitcoins when they dropped to $200. Neither of them are true because you're looking at the past while knowing how things turned out in the present. Apple could've gone under, and nearly did, and those early investors could have lost everything. They might've performed dozens of hours researching but it was a gamble nonetheless. Similarly, a $200 Bitcoin is cheap compared to the current price but the price could've dropped to $50 just as easily as increasing to $450. People who bought at $200 were taking a gamble.
Nobody really knows what's going to happen after the halving and I'm sure the other commenter was asking you about "one weird trick..." because you said the price must increase dramatically after the halving, which is absurdly foolish. Ever heard the phrase, "past performance is not indicative of future results"? There are many other factors involved so if you really think the Bitcoin market is as simple as "basic supply and demand" then you may want to read some of the pieces written by people who urge caution regarding the halving. In all honesty, unless I misunderstood your comments, you may want to read up on the psychological traps associated with investing as well.

I'm not sure why you thought you could incorrectly paraphrase what you originally wrote when it's just a few inches of screen real estate away. No, here's what you wrote:


The only conditional you put in your "if" clause is Bitcoin demand trends being anywhere close to the past three years, not anything about the supply dropping. You **did** say if the demand maintains the recent trend the price will rise **dramatically**,  a key adverb. Then you say it's just simple economics, "as easy as it gets", and you say supply won't even come close to meeting demand, like it's a proven law of nature. Regardless of your intention, your messages come across like you're arguing that the price of Bitcoin will certainly or almost certainly increase "dramatically" after the halving. As others have said, the halving could very well already be factored into the current price and there are several other reasons why the price might not shoot up. 
Oh god, I just re-read a comment of yours and noticed this gem when you mentioned buying "cheap" coins at $200 last year:


Buuuuullshit, nobody knew if the price would rise or continue to fall when the price was at $200. Profitable investments are sometimes borne out of plain old market insight and analysis but so are terrible investments where all the money is lost. With an extremely unique, new technology like Bitcoin, you have to be delusional or a charlatan to say that you can predict where the price will go with such certainty.
