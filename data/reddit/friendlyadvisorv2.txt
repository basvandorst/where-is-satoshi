Hahahahaha. I'm sure Satoshi himself would laugh! But no bitcoin is a really well manufactured version of an already existing idea. Newton's Principia Vol 1 was a stand alone book that changed the entire way we look at the world and the universe in general. It opened up a golden age in physics. All bitcoin is doing is shaking up wall street. Believe me, if bitcoin was doing to the world now as to what Principia did back then. Bitcoin would be worth hundreds of billions of dollars already. Not the measly $12k that we're sitting at right now.

My moon is owning a rooftop bar in NYC with a Tesla Roadster and being able to retire at 45.
I want a modern house that's totally technologically integrated into my life, similar to JARVIS. I then want 2 away homes. A rustic cabin up on the top of a snow capped mountain and then a beachfront home somewhere else in the world. That's not my moon that's my edge of the solar system. I cant imagine life being any more perfect at that moment.

I think this is exactly what the community needs to have stickied LONG TERM. Too many people are coming in hear with panic trying to get in on all the hype, when really this isnt what is going to last for the ages. This community has faced accusations of censorship and blindness. Now while I personally believe these claims to be false, I think we need to accept these claims and debunk them seriously. We as a community must be a respectable and friendly place for our personal advice and even hosting memes to make the average first time Bitcoin investor to feel at home and happy for having a community of trusted people to watch and laugh and cry together as we share a common goal of moving closer to a financial future we want to achieve.

Oh its going to the moon. But every major stock no matter how perfect always goes through slight corrections. That's just the way things are. I want info on others strategies for the public.

You better hodl. Whats your wallet look like. There was a straw poll I saw where most people are holding 1000+ bitcoins and I was a little shocked

Im in the same boat and I made back the money I spent in fees in 15 minutes.

He’s charging $600 for a crypto teaching class, where honestly I’d rather throw that money at bitcoin right now and just sit back than learning a really basic skill.

Who knows. If the growth rate stays the same as it is right now its definitely possible. But who knows. Bitcoin might fall 10k in 2 hours

That man is worth in excess of almost $10 Billion....

Crypto Bobby is good. He's been in the game a while. Whatever you do dont even think about looking at Tai Lopez. He is a theif wrapped in a bad joke and caked in bullshit...

The fact that this reached the top of the Hot for 5 minutes says a whole lot about us. I made this meme in legitimately 5 minutes. [Mfw posting a meme on after buying 2 days ago.](

This comment is severely underrated.

Its very likely because of the press surpassing 10k that it corrects to below 10k

Speak to a parent, show them this sub. You need an account to transfer funds to an exchange and a verified identification. There's a sidebar post but [this is a link]( that might be useful to someone with not a lot of money.

Buying even a small amount now could equate to thousands of dollars in the future. Do yourself a favor and put in $50 and wake up 20 years from now with a pretty $50,000 in your account.
