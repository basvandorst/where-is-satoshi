Fuck off.  Just google your bank with "disable overdraft".  It's been around for almost ten years now.  If you can't handle googling something or, here's a crazy thought, calling your bank and asking, you are gonna have a bad time in life.

Someone tipped me ten cents a few years ago.  Remembered yesterday about changetip and withdrew $22.  The world is a strange place right now.

Nah man I'm not trying to put your suggestion down or anything.  I just thought it was funny that the dude said it's not really accessible and you link him some three hour podcasts.  Joe's podcasts are awesome.

I think we can all agree that 9 hours to learn about something you aren't sure you are interested in is "not really accessible".  Does nobody have a sense of humor around here?

Gotcha.  Yeah, I'd have a personal "day job" that would probably bring in a few dollars a week.  I just hate the title "work".  I have an amazing job doing what I love and I still find it exhausting to have people to report to and places to be at certain times.

I think fuck you money has different definitions to different people.  If I came into $5,000,000 right now I'd continue working.  It's not enough to retire into the kind of lifestyle I'm working towards.  Ten million, on the other hand...
Definitely close to fuck you money for me.  For some people it's legit fuck you money.

I am completely confident that I could stop working and be happy for the rest of my life with various hobbies.
