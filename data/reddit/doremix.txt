What do you have in mind for the new PoW algo? Is it going to be ASIC resistant? We are in this mess bc Satoshi didn't precict the efficiency of ASICs.

Number of shitposts is proportional to BTC's volatility.

If you think your opinion is true then you can make money by shorting. By not shorting you proved you don't believe in what you're saying.
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:14:29
Do you have proof it'd be impossible?

Guesstimate = I've no idea what I'm doing. Learn math.

Define "almost everybody" as a number. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:23:53
I don't think so. The problem is then reduced to implementing all of these algos in ASIC and connecting their inputs and outputs.

I don't "check price manually". I have preev.com open in one of chrome tabs. It displays BTC/USD price in the tab's title.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:56:24
so the price will fall, stay the same, or rise. is that what you are saying? :p
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:04:56
IMO yes. Big blockers will hopefully fuck off and keep to their fork.

"cheap coins", "weak hands", "smart investors", "LOL HODL", "... moon ...". Please just STFU with this repetitive trash.

what wrong with c
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:34:24
This makes little sense. If machines were able to make the matrix, I'm pretty sure they'd be able to solve captchas too :P

What's the probability (in %) that BIP148 fails, given current network situation? How do I compute this % myself?
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:38:35
!RemindMe 3 years
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:15:01
Did you short BTC then? Let me guess - you didn't.
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:35:15
You said nothing about ASIC resistance in your topmost comment, I assumed the general case.
I agree, having N ASIC-resistant algos feeding each other is harder than 1 ASIC-resitant one.

upvote for fart sniffing.

2,300 ¥ ~ 340 $.
What are they trading, exactly. There is no BCC yet (?). Are these people buying entries in ViaBTC database?
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:41:43
so? the volatility is high anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:22:23
You forgot about "Hello X$, I don't believe we met" or "Hello Y$, old friend". Also on every price drop: cheap coins for sale!!11.
I also wonder how often we are going to see meta-shitposts making fun of other shitposts. This is the first one :P
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:46:09
liek this:  ?

1) segwit2x is about segwit+2MB blocks. 2MB part = hardfork1. 
1) hardfork2 is Bitcoin cash. this has nothing to do with s2x. group of miners wants more control over btc, so they are making their hardfork2.
2) yes.
IMO bitcoin trash (cash) will die quickly. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:53:34
90%? How did you get that %?
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:03:35
Attack: make a device that looks exactly the same, but always displays "sealed" light pattern. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:55:27
cool story bro
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:24:21
