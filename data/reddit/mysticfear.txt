You banned me for saying you had a conflict of interest as a mod and had investments in Moolah. You removed my posts/comments concerning Moolah. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 01:31:47
You just lied and now we are suppose to believe you?

Thank you sir! I would love doggie treats. But if you desire you can provide some treats to people in need. I'm doing pretty ok in life. You are indeed pretty god-like.

If they are anonymous and their business starts slowly declining, the temptation of stealing all the remaining money is quite high.

Why am I not posting this you may ask? I'm still banned from there due to my warnings of "Alex Green"
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:25:30
I understand you might agree what has wrote, but he is a classic pump and dumper. He was trying to spread a rumor about [Coinbase accepting Dogecoin]( because he knew someone on the inside. I [called him out]( on it.
@_date: 2014-11-08 01:42:47
You mentioning facts that are completely wrong: 
1) you were banned so often for "trolling" on dogecoin: WRONG
2) banned by myself for any direct Moolah-related content: WRONG. I mentioned you owned part of Moolah and got banned by you.
You are completely biased. Owning part of Moolah is even worse than working for the company. Who knows how long you actually worked for the company.

Why do people keep using a financial service with an anonymous owner?
There are other options out there.

I was only banned once (by yourself). You enjoy lying with elaborate paragraphs. I even caught you in a lie within this thread. I do not care about my status with the subreddit.

Sorry for promoting doge by tipping, but that made me laugh. We are all in this together.

I'm not implying it, if I can prove it by fact. I just did. Facts sometimes can hurt.

I'm very pro Dogecoin, and this is accurate. Love it

Don't mind me, I'm an idiot. I was looking too fast to notice, it was from CT. Striked through and added what I think is the Bristol police news wire for people in court.

You should have been following me. Been telling others of the shadiness of Moolah from the beginning. Very few believed me. Even got silenced by mods

I'm just going to leave my earlier conversation a few days ago about this here:
[Why do people keep using a financial service with an anonymous owner?](
@_date: 2014-03-27 08:10:04
You probably do not realize this, but the US produces both the most oil and gas [[source](
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:10:45
I remember He bought into Dogecoin than spread a rumor 3 days later that [Coinbase was adopting Dogecoin]( than got called out for it even by [myself]( 
I guess he goes around and tries to pump and dump. Just look at his reddit history.
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:17:49
Yes that had to do with the rise of Dogecoins, they got a lot more traffic. Scaling issues. Your major exchanges you speak of are probably run by anonymous owners :(

Government authority take down. Usually when people want to stay anonymous in Europe, it is usually due to evading taxes. Completely understandable. But, what happens when they grow to a certain size they get the attention of tax authorities in their country? 
Do you think an Eastern European country will care about sending your money back?

The Silkroad was anonymous as well. Yeah they are getting around authorities for now. It is just a matter of time and scale.

Since, I'm from and we have a community that answers questions. I will answer your question. 
It is a casino in Las Vegas that recently accepted Bitcoin.

I actually know enough about TA, to know that you know what you are talking about. You sound a lot more advanced than me.
What reading materials would you recommend? 
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:52:59
Reputation is great when things are going well, but when something goes really bad. Greed usually trumps reputation when you are anonymous.

Hopefully this will get updated tomorrow: ~~

Support and/or create an exchange in a government that doesn't rob their exchanges then. Then not be anonymous. So no one gets robbed.  
@_date: 2014-02-10 09:09:13
No problem. My pleasure to take down bad actors in our communities.
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:37:39
Very interesting, thank you! 
If I could pick your brain even more, I would love to know your trading strategy. It seems like a combination of TA and reacting to news events that create polarity, no? 
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:44:58
until it doesn't, then poof the guy disappears. Atleast the Mt.Gox management cannot disappear from legal authorities.

Does anyone see the irony in people wanting a more central authority with this subreddit about a currency that's main purpose is to remove centralized authority?
@_date: 2013-12-25 08:53:07
well since 1 million doges are called slumdoges (for obvious reasons). So I guess the creator just called 1 thousand doges Mega.
