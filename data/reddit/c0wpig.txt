Why are both of the bitcoin forums are so aroused by conspiracy theories?
And why is everything always a 'vs' on the Internet? In real life I rarely encounter situations with two opposing sides yet somehow every issue I read about on the Internet is a with us or against us thing.

OK so I have a bunch of coins and my private key is stolen. Someone tries to move my funds to another account, and I block it using... the same private key? 
Now what? Are my coins stuck in limbo until the attacker and I hash things out? Do we both just spam the blockchain with transfers to another key until one of us misses the chance to block the transaction? Is there a second backup key? If that's the case, what happens if that one is stolen?

Where can I learn more about this private key issue?

can you explain why?

I don't see how you can possibly argue that case for software patents.

What patent does Roger Ver own? I can't find anything online.
The bitcoin patents I'm aware of are [Blockstream's]( [two]( and the [asicboost]( one, which isn't owned by Roger Ver.

I just received a second (identical to the first) automated email from them about verifying my account. It has now been two weeks of waiting.
Also still waiting to hear back from Kraken on the same issue; although I did get one human response (can you please send a more high-res version of your ID) after 8 days.
Someone with customer support skills please start a competing buy-crypto service!!
edit: Kraken finally got back to me today! 25k deposit limit! :) but only via sketchy-looking wire transfer :(
