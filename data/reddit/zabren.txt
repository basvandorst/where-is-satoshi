Ha, I have an entire Tiger Direct distribution center in my backyard. They have a retail store attached to it. You can go online, buy something, then get it from their massive inventory quickly. Very nice. Still like newegg better.

The payment process is super cool to. I had never bought anything with bitcoin until I purchased computer upgrades from newegg.
I mean, they give you an address and a countdown. Pay in another window, and it instantly recognizes payment and says thanks. That's just freaking awesome.

Thats what stops me from using linux full time. Drivers. God damnit AMD, can you not just divert a few resources to make a ton of people happy?

Ok, so I'm just now getting into bitcoin, and am planning to be a miner (as someone who has a high end gpu, and planning on getting an ASIC when they come out...), what kind of registration do I need? any useful links you could give me?
I seriously don't want to get into government trouble lol. that would be no bueno.

True that. The thing is, the pool I'm using just had a new user come on with almost 1TH/s. Dropped down my share from 0.002 btc per block to 0.0005.

If there was a way of limiting purchasing to just debit, I'd be super excited about this. But I'm pretty sure it would have to accept credit cards too (not to sure about that...), which is a terrible idea.

aren't asic electricity costs negligible compared to gpu mining?

Volatility also goes down when infrastructure is sound, and and right now, its anything but.

lol, freakin seer. Well, not worthless, just....dropped significantly =P

Well, thats a nice surprise.
Oh how I wish i had gotten into bitcoin when I first heard about it. Back when 20 bitcoin was $20 usd. =/

I'm still waiting on dwolla to process so i can make my first purchase....holy hell they take freakin forever. As for now....mining, oh so slowly (7950), and getting free uBTC on the internet. =/
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:02:39
lol, college student, no way &gt;$1k can happen. What really took forever w/ dwolla was account verification.

hmmm. [Here's]( a very recent (March 18, 2013) pdf of regulations of virtual currencies.
in part c. of the section titled Administrators and Exchangers of Virtual Currencies, it says:


exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual 
currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer 
of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency.
So looks like  **every** person who has ever sold BTC for legal tender money is branded as an exchanger/transmitter.
I appreciate it man. I like to be aware of all the little details :D
If you read this pdf a different way.....I'd be interested in hearing why :)

hmmm...my phone won't scan it.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:10:15
why buy at 105 when the market is fluctuating so much? I mean, thats practically the daily high....why not wait till its down to 60 or so again?
Yeah, that sucks man. Best of luck.

With bitpay, you don't have to think of it as a currency, but as an different type of payment, much like, credit, check, debit, and cash.

As someone who is just now getting into bitcoin, I'm using campbx. I've heard to many negative things about mtgox, and not much bad about campbx.
Now to just get established.....
