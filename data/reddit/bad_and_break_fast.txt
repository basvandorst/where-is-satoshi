What a chauvinist!

Well, you did a good job. I can imagine that it was not simple at all. But apart from money and some level of life, you achieved also strong confidence, you now know that you can do it by yourself. 
This is the biggest issue with social welfare (or winning in a lottery..), a guy gets money, but not self-esteem whatsoever. In this sense, it is even hurting those whom it is supposed to help (is that correct English? never sure about WHOM.-). 
So there is nothing to envy these "lazy" people, they live in shit and they feel like shit, sorry to say. Moreover, giving them money will not change it much. Though, some kind of education, or rather psychotherapy can do. To show them the very feeling of succeeding in something, in a general sense, not only a career. Since they can't even imagine that, nobody taught them. 
So try to spread your story around and motivate these people. Thus you can really help them.

I may not agree with this. Imagine how costly is doing the same job locally, it is much more efficient if an algorithm optimizes search results in advance, so then I just spent several seconds doing that. 
First on the physical level, just sum up the electricity consumption (of LCD etc), amortization of machines etc. The search algorithm doesn't need LCD whatsoever. 
More importantly, imagine how many brain-hours are saved in this way.. just a small improvement in their algorithm is saving several tens of lifes a day! That is where the real wealth is created.

Nope, he got it right. Look at google, this is a great example of creating something out of nothing. They save everybody tons of time by providing an excellent search service, nobody is loosing there.

No, to total value of the markets is growing steadily, it is not a zero-sum game.. though I am not sure what happens if you subtract inflation.

Appreciated, great work, thanks!

Great! .-))

Still, the resources used on their side are much smaller than on a client's side if he had to do it by himself
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:24:18


well no, you could even use it to anybody else, not necessarily
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:35:06
Nice one!
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:13:39
12 -&gt; 17 is ~40%, so yep, fast!

Right, that is why I suggested some scientific results, look up studies on subjective well-being. People getting rich by some accident, like a lottery, are happy quite a short time, less than a year. Then their level of life satisfaction is the same as before. 
Come on, do you really want caviar so much? Or you want to be somebody that can show that he can afford to eat caviar? Find what you really want, and use Bitcoin to achieve your true aims. Caviar? I don't believe you, try again.-) 
If you need an experience, go ahead and pay some tramp. I guess you can afford one already, no need to be extra rich. If you will be honest with your feelings afterwards, I bet you won't feel that good.

Privacy costs something, and an average Joe doesn't want to pay for it as he doesn't need it. At least not for buying a coffee.
Thus I would say that the true anarchists will stop to use BTC one day since there will be a much better alternative for their needs. 
And average Joe will follow them once in a month when buying something delicate, with better privacy and higher fee.
We will see.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:38:40
Agreed, we don't need BTC for crypto anarchy anymore, there are hundreds of alternatives, some of them better fitting this niche than BTC.  Thus it doesn't hurt much if BTC will go mainstream. 
I think that this tension was at the very core of the scaling debate.

I think that you can do both, be a responsible father, and still live your own life on. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:27:36
Are you insane? You have 50% in dollars? Think about your kids..  
.. which you are just doing! Congrats, follow your own way. Possibly you will be a hero for them one day.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:28:05
Well, I can tell you this, you would be happier with the second option. Drinking Rosé with bitches and caviar IS NOT a way to make one happy or satisfied (in any longer perspective), it IS only a grandiose cliche. 
The happy people that are rich were happy even before getting rich. There is a lot of research on this fact, look it up. Not to invest your lifetime to getting somewhere where you actually would be unsatisfied, albeit possibly rich.
