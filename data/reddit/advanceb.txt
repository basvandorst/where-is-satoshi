Hi there, Thanks for your reply. I dont fully understand to be honest. What is the 12 word seed? Is that the key?
Whats the full process? Do I register with trezor, then add the extension to my chrome browser, then pay 89 euro, get the device and plug it in? 
At what point do I get the key?
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:31:19
Sorry to bother you with this but what do you mean when you say they need 9 confirmations?
Am I right in saying that this exchange has high integrity as it has links to the DFS? On their website it says:
''HIGH REGULATORY AND SECURITY STANDARDS
Strict regulatory oversight, global AML/KYC compliance and 100% offline bitcoin cold storage ensure our platform and client assets are secure.''
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:08:03
HI thanks for the info. Does the trezor hardware wallet device support ethereum as well as bitcoin or just bitcoin? I had a look on the website but couldnt see it. 
I noticed that Ledger Nano S  does support ethereum
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:44:44
can anyone make a comment on this?
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:02:40
for what?

I agree. And maybe $85k is small change for this guy. Everyone is different. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:26:04
Its simple. Its a hedge against BTC. If your smart you will buy BCH to cover your ass. Most people here would have done this although they will not admit to it. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:34:36
but what if 2x destroys bitcoin legacy core? I hope bitcoin core doesnt die. But it is a possibility. Have you not considered this??
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:57:40
I've read your comments and interested to know what you think will happen with the BtC price in mid dec and Jan when CME starts futures contracts. How much do you think the price will go to in early 2018?
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:29:50
dont you think theres a risk that the legacy bitcoin chain will die in a few weeks time
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:31:53
get in before CME futures launches. price will be heading upwards...
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:39:46
You sound immature. I'm sure your aged in early 20's
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:17:28
40k is conservative and I think yr term is too long. I think its going to happen next yr. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:19:35
why do you think there will be a massive sell off on CME? 
I thought there would be the opposite. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:12:42
This is exactly the way I perceive the current situation. Its all about the demand set by the buyers. 
Theres so much hype now this yr on the internet. In my country one of the major newspapers ran a spread about 1 bitcoin for 1 million $. It was like a tabloid article. But who cares. It will likely result in hundreds of new people registering with exchanges and buying coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:37:44
You could get egg on your face for this comment. What do you think is going to happen after the 2x hard fork in 2 weeks? Theres a chance that the legacy chain will die
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:25:39
this is right but everyone might sell at different times. It might go to 50k by mid next yr. some people will sell some people will wait for 100k. etc 
it will go up and down for this reason. 
If something bad happens... if an exchange goes broke then this could trigger panic selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:01:22
Hi King turd,
You must be young and have a low I.Q
The bitcoin price is now $7377. Its still way below what I sold for. Obviously I can buy back today and not lose anything. Duh....

Hi, I read your comment with interest. What do you think is going to happen to the BTC price after CME bitcoin futures are introduced next month? How high do you think its going to go in early 2018?
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:02:11
Thanks for your reply. 
I agree that interesting times lay ahead. I believe there will be huge price surges in 2018. Its going to be hard (decision wise) if it does go up to 50k or 70k next yr- as to whether one should take profits or not. It would be annoying to sell and then in 3 yrs time its up to 400k or whatever. 
The so called bubble bursting comes down a lot to the 'buyers'. If buyers disappear then price will plummet. Theres so much demand due to all the hype. The SMH newspaper in my country just reported on teh front page that they expect bitcoin to be 1 million. From that article alone many australians will register at an exchange and start buying. Wait until they see the price rises in 2018. I think theres going to be a lot of demand for bitcoin in 2018. Its all exciting stuff. 
cheers and have a good weekend
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:59:42
Are you saying that you dont think CME launching futures on bitcoin in mid dec will have much of an impact on the price of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:26:55
I think bitcoin cash could have a chance of becoming the new bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:53:42
Except when the bitcoin legacy chain dies after the hard fork!
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:01:43
Re your comment above I dont quite understand it sorry. What is the impact of all this on the BTC price? How much do you think its going to rise when CME introduces futures on bitcoin in mid dec?
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:33:43


You tool. Now look at the bitcoin cash price. You were wrong ha ha
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:16:30
This is nothing compared to whats coming when CME start trading futures on bitcoin. Expect huge price swings- hopefully up up up
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:32:32
A good time to buy is in 2 weeks when the price crashes before/ after the Segwit2x fork. Are you unaware of the fork coming up????
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:25:19
or maybe bitcoin legacy chain will die. Have you ever considered this?
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:20:09
in the nanny state you are paying large premiums above what U.S exchanges are offering- after converting. A complete rip off to buy bitcoin in oz.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:19:12
exactly. This is why investing in BTC is a once in a lifetime opportunity to make significant returns. Im not saying it will go on for ever but 2018 will be the time of big gains. after that I dont know
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:41:34
ok thanks for that
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:00:07
only when the core chain dies will you cry in your pillow. its daft not to diversify and hold both. Buy some back now before you get egg on your face. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:27:28
your wrong about keepkey. They do support an additional passphrase. But you have to ask them for the instructions. Its 100% possible to do passphrase
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:53:54
I always get a reply within 6 to 12 hours of emailing them. Im sure you will if you email them.

FB is an advertising company and competes directly with Google. 
I think there are still huge growth streams available in the coming yrs. A few days ago a journalist reported Instagram is getting closer to 1 bn users. So many businesses and companies are selling via Instagram now. Its only the start. 
I really believe the price will rocket up to $500 a share and beyond in the next 5 yrs. I bought in at $82 a share. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:36:40
did your problem get resolved? Did they get back to you? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:43:14
you dont hold the private keys to your cryptos if you keep it on the exchange. Buy a hardware wallet- trezor or keepkey

@_date: 2017-09-27 02:43:54
Would using the extra passphrase word negate the risk that you highlight. Only the user creates and keeps the passphrase (in his/her memory). If the malware cant get the passphrase surely it would mean that they cant take your coin even if they have all the other seed words?
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:27:43
Read the title. It says 'or'. The implication is that there are 2 different investment options. One is bitcoin. The other is investing in shares on Nasdaq. Thats great that you realize that bitcoin is not on nasdaq....

no offense but you sound naive to think that the 2x fork will be insignificant. Do you really think that bitcoin core, cash, gold and 2x can co-exist together? No way
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:01:19
thanks for the info. Its really useful
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:22:13
its bc the government dont like the lack of control over their people. The locals can launder money using bitcoin and send it overseas. they have limitations on this with their local currency. But they dont like bitcoin as they cant control outflow. thats why they are cracking down. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:01:13
I bought into FB big time at $80 and still hold it. I think its still got a long way to go and will be up in the 500 range in the coming years. It has solid financials and promising revenue streams. If you think you have missed out on FB I believe your a bit naive. The stock is still cheap. 
Be cautious with bitcoin until the hard fork is over in Nov. Who knows what can happen with shitcoin in nov.

dont congratulate anyone or yourself until you have sold and taken profits i.e. the cash is in your bank account. 
things are uncertain for bitcoin at the moment with the seg2x fork coming. There is not room for bitcoin core, b2x and bitcoin cash. anything can happen. One or more might die

Is the issue the OP experienced possible if I have a hardware wallet? Or am I safe from this problem?
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:28:31
this is my strategy also. I feel like selling my coin next week and having a chunk of cash on the exchange and wait for a price correction. Theres so much uncertainty now with the fork coming. 
If I sell now and the price drop doesnt happen then I have no coins on either chain. It will then be hard to wait and see who wins the battle. 
What are your thoughts / strategy?

I agree with you. This is what I think will happen. I think the fork issues are going to cause a massive sell off. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:53:35
Are you saying, for example, if there's a price correction all all cryptos you will buy the alt that you want whilst its cheaper? I think I will do this if ethereum drops when the hard fork B.S happens. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:57:51
At least one can put a value on a company like FBook by looking at their earnings growth.

on paper. but you only make money when you actually sell it 
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:07:45
How can you use that as an indication/ comparison? The first hard fork with BCH was more predictable and much safer than the Seg2x coming. It was clear at the time that the new chain was not going to be a threat to the legacy bitcoin core chain. Knowing this most people bought into bitcoin knowing their coin would be cloned on the new chain. Everyone knew it was a Segwit vs No segwit issue.
But now its a lot more uncertain. Its not the same situation
  
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:36:58

But what if bitcoin core (legacy) dies and SegWit2x chain survives? Its all bad for bitcoin. Price will surely fall down on all cryptos?
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:26:59
I agree. Its so hard to know what is going to happen. My gut feeling is that bitcoin price/s are going to go down down down. Its all a bit screwed up at the moment. Its a buying opportunity if this happens and I will have my money waiting on the exchange....
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:02:55
Do you mind if I ask.... are you not worried about the hard fork in Nov. Surely theres going to be  a huge price correction in Nov. Maybe a chain will die. Its all bad for bitcoin in Nov. 
What do you think is going to happen in Nov with the price?
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:17:43
buy a keepkey hardware wallet and transfer immediately from the exchange after you buy it. Use youtube to help you
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:40:56
Correct. There is no charges for withdrawal of bitcoin out from a itBit account. i.e. no mining fees
