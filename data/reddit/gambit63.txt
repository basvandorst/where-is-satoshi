It's not the first card in general. It is the first pre-paid Bitcoin debit card in the United States either by Visa, Mastercard, Discover, whoever. If you'regoing to say "not the first card" than it would seem appropriate to list what card you believe is the first that went outside of a test market. It's not the first SHIFT card in the US, but it is the first SHIFT BITCOIN DEBIT card in the US.

Actually the IRS default is FIFO, not LIFO. If you want to file by "Most Appropriate Lot" that is preferred (if you can)
and that as a general rule can reduce your capital gains tax liability. Even small examples demonstrate the difference.
However, if you can't do Most Appropriate Lots, then you should definitely use FIFO which most likely would result in higher capital gains tax, but since FIFO is the default (and this is evidenced by Coinbase offering a FIFO report) than it would seem best to err on the side of caution. LIFO may result in you having to refile. As for consistency, that part is true. Whatever method you use, stick to but I would consider that as applying to the two methods I have espoused, not between FIFO or LIFO.

First fully functioning US BTC debit card. That rules out Xapo because it's not a US card. Prior to Xapo  the only bitcoin debit cards in circulation, such as those offered by Coincard and Cryptex, were slightly less practical. Instead of funds being taken straight from their bitcoin wallets at the time of a transaction, customers had to top-up their card beforehand. Meaning they had to convert their bitcoin amounts to fiat manually. So, there's little disagreement that Coinbase has launched the first US based prepaid debit card in the truest and most functional sense, not in a pedantic one.
