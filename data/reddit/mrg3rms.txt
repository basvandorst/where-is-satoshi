You can use the same wallet for both without issues, I don't think it is better to have separate wallets for each currency. Hardware wallets are designed to hold a variety of coins. As for the transaction, I personally never had to wait more than a hour for my transaction to be confirmed. My exchange give me the option to send a regular fee of 0.01 btc or a saver fee of 0.005btc (takes longer). If you have the option, choose the higher fee to speed things up. There is not much you can do apart from that.

you're not too late, best time is now...not to say there won't be a dip but you should come out ahead if you hold

short answer: nobody really knows

Keep it for the long run.

I don't know about the average, what matters is you and what you can put in. Any amount is better than no amount, invest what you can.

You know what it takes to invest in BTC? It takes brass balls to invest in BTC.

cold storage is a lot safer than exchanges or hot wallets. You will see your coin balance when you plug in your trezor, remember coins (transactions) are not actually stored in the device but on the blockchain. There is an interface to send or receive coins. 
I am pretty sure trezor supports bitcoin cash too,no need for another wallet.

you don't know what you're talking about. Do a minimum of research before trying to give "advice". 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:15:55

Safest way to store is cold storage, like a paper wallet or hardware wallet.

Sucks but insight is 20/20
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:24:39
look into hardware wallets like ledger or trezor, the process is pretty straightforward.

I like Ethereum, I think it is a good project with lots of potential and strong development and support behind it. It is a good idea to diversify your holdings a bit.

You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin, anything you can afford is fine. Look at the Getting Started link in the sidebar. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:23:34
It is worth buying. You could spread that between all three coins if you re nervous about going all in on bitcoin.
