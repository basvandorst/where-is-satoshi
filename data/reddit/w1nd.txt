Don't kid yourself, this image is one of the most well known anti-Semitic caricatures. Do yourself a favor and replace that image.
It pains me to link buzzfeed, but here it is.

While i appreciate the message, mind you that BILD is the shittiest of tabloids. For murricans, imagine a mix of TMZ, breitbart and BuzzFeed. It's the equivalent of a printed out clickbait website with even less journalistic integrity.

It all comes down to whom do you trust more: yourself, in properly storing your keys or multiple third entities that are entirely outside of your control. I know which I'll be choosing 10 times out of 10.
It's like arguing against insurance. Why would I need fire insurance? My house has never burned down nor do i smoke. I like to err on the side of precaution and go with the insurance even though I could have saved that money for the last 30 years. Because third parties like my neighbor or some errand  firework - however unlikely it might be - might burn my house down in the 31st year.

That's kind of a super dumb statement. 
My ethereum and Raiblocks/NANO were half a year on Bitgrail and no problems until there were problems and now I am part of a class action lawsuit in an Italian court January 2020 were I can expect to reclaim not even a fraction of what once was mine.

Russia seems to have more localbitcoin transactions. Localbitcoins is only one of many ways of acquiring bitcoins and it seems to be very popular in Russia. Maybe there are easier methods in other countries which are not taken into account in this graphic. Surely Korea, Germany and Japan are ahead of South Africa in crypto adoption.

History doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes a lot. Whenever someone blames the misdeeds off a few people onto an entire ethnicity or religion and makes generalizations that can be interpreted to incite and actually cause violence towards said minority, it's my obligation to at least point that out. Tommy is a vertically challenged crypto fascist and deserves to be mocked at every occasion. He would definitely not have been on the right side of history back then and he sure isn't right now.

I couldn't get past the first one and a half minutes of this video. What a douche nozzle. 
There's no reason why this video needs to be 33 minutes other than ad revenue and/or narcicism.
