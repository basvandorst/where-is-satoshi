it's BitCoin* and yes, it's likely to take off again given world events trending toward negative. im buying now while no one else is interested per warren buffets sage advice.

I wonder if a reddit admin could remove him for his censorship, manipulation, and financial corruption?
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:18:38
amazing, a mod with integrity.its time to start a new sub or move to the xt sub if jratcliff gets canned. lets leave theymos bashco starmaged and the others to this corrupt sub
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:28:36
dont forget bashco and his changetip relationship
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:31:20

its important that his alert key is invalidated by a software version coming soon. I dont understand how the community can trust him at the helm, able to flip the btc death switch.

btc core is the north korea of the internet

propagate*. i can assure you, 0-confirm transaction policy for merchants will bite them in the ass and ultimately hurt bitcoin adoption when enough get burned by consumers double spending to cancel transactions. i think it's better to accept that bitcoin is not truly instant or fast - it can stand on its other merits. i am actually working on a side project to improve propagation times, which i'll submit for community review soon.
