Multisig is great and all, but you cant create any business logic inside of them. 
Lightning network is just nonpresent in payments.
Issue is, that with PoW smartcontracts cant be used. If ETH2.0 fails then I would do agree that ETH is dead. However one also has to understand that this stuff is not easy to develop and cant be done 2-3 years.

I did not say its going to be a bitcoin killer. I dont realy understand why you guys think there can be only 1 blockchain... ETH is a totally different usecase then bitcoin.

Dude, this is Proof of work, same shit bitcoin uses, how is this an argument? The network does not halt, it is just more expensive to send a transaction, the tps is the same...

We are not talking about the worth of tokens.

Its all about consensus. ETH in its !current state! is a dead end because smartcontracts can cause many times more transaction then just simple A to B btc transfers. This is not a secret nor something that hasnt be known by mostly everyone. Thats why they push for ETH2.0.
BTC did not experience major issues because its x times bigger then eth and has much less transaction, but still it cant handle more then idk something like 7 per second. Just because it does not face the same issues as ETH doesnt mean it wouldnt.
This is not about eth or btc, its about PoW being a dead end for consensus for onchain datastorage.
Decentralized smartcontracts are very much needed, else there is no progress in the blockchain world. 
ETH may or may not deliver ETH2.0 but without it all you have is BTC. BTC alone is not enough. Or would you like to use OP_Return forever as onchain datastorage?

An ETH full node takes like 5 hours to sync and is something like 140gb is size...  
Also btc has like 9k full nodes running and ETH like 8k
  
   *And the few company that still does, will update their software code without even checking anything* 
Yes because every btc software, or software update is made by Satoshi God himself and can be trusted 100%...
  *This is the same reason why Ethereum is 'easy money', and can't even compete with FIAT.* 
Why would it want to compete with fiat? Its a paltform for decentralized codexecution...

 \&gt; I disagree because there are many, **many** Ethereum bagholders who have been led to believe that ETH will make a monumental comeback, and even overtake Bitcoin. Remember "The Flippening" hype? So if "mostly everyone" knew, then they are all scammers as far as I'm concerned. 
Lets not switch up investing and technology. There are many other bagholders for different projects left up for worse.  
\&gt;  I don't agree with that either. It's just that on chain storage is rather slow and expensive. 
You dont agree, but you agree that the issues I mentioned as cause for being a dead end are valid problems. Im confused.
 \&gt; I also disagree with this. Taproot and Mast should open up a lot of new possibilities for Bitcoin, and without the extreme risks that have plagued Ethereum.  
"Should" but they havent yet. Why? Because its either not scalable in PoW enviroment like it is not on ETH(or worse), or it takes very long to build it because it is truly something groundbraking new tech. These 2 points are also why delivering ETH2.0 takes so long.  
All that Im trying to say is, that scalability is an issue, it has to be solved else we go nowhere.

This is only true for light clients, Im talking about fast sync.

Bitcoin can't execute smartcontracts. Because it wasnt made for smartcontracts. And thats not a problem, so lets not make it one.

Lol, I bet the poor ssd in the local node to which you send the async request will be able to keep up with your quantumspeed, haha.
