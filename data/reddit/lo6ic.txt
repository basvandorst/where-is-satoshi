Thanks for teaching people how to trade extremely volatile "assets" on margin.  What could possibly go wrong?

Are you able to buy/sell equities or is the $ just sitting there in escrow?

Robinhood is notorious for taking forever to settle accounts from buying/selling stocks, I can't even imagine how long its going to take to complete a transaction for crypto.

Not to be a Debbie downer or anything, but what kind of BS is this?  Yes, over 7 days Bitcoin is completely flat whereas the DJIA is down ~6%.  I don't think anyone in their right mind would classify BTC as "stable" considering it's tanked ~40% within a two day period then bounced back.

Not exactly sure of the time frame of his bankruptcy filing nor what the price of bitcoin was at when he "forgot" to disclose it, but an article came out at the end of last month highlighting his $7M-$8.5M bitcoin fortune.  I would assume it's extremely frowned upon to hide assets during a bankruptcy filing, so I wonder if he's going to catch any heat over this whole ordeal.

If I "behave" like a dog, does that make me a dog? Asking for a friend, of course.

I was talking about completing the transaction &amp; settling the account, not the holding period.

Well put.  Couldn't have said it any better myself.

Haha, right?!  How convenient that he "forgot" that he owned millions in bitcoin when he was disclosing all of his assets to file for bankruptcy.

It's a slippery slope.  Although they won't recognize it as money, it still holds a specific value since it has liquidity.  If they start making exceptions with this, you're going to see a lot of people sheltering their cash in crypto in similiar situations.

Yeah, that seems like a bit of overkill.  I can see the purpose of doing to to try to curb laundering, but I don't see the purpose of doing so if you haven't executed a trade.  Is there a similar holding period for trading equities?
