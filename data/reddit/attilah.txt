Very cool app.
I'm a programmer too.
Where and how did you learn to design ?
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:53:46
There's no links

Any chance we can get a github link to see what lightning is about and how its implemented ?

You can cherry-pick commits you are interested in and merge them with bitcoin-core and your problem would be solved.
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:38:45
This. I don't understand it either.

Is this in Seattle ?

I thought so too a few weeks ago. But they finally did come back to me and I was able to make some withdrawals, so I decided to leave some of my coins with them.
EDIT: My account was locked(name typo), which was the reason withdrawals were disabled for 2 days.
@_date: 2016-06-04 06:01:35
Yeah, you don't certainly understand it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:40:37
I'm interested in trying out the beta.

Why not use btc directly instead of multiple altcoins? Is this in order to track how much trust each coin carries with it depending on who initially took the credit ?
@_date: 2019-08-26 07:38:41
Thanks a lot for making it clearer to people like me.
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:15:54
Why *no skills* ? Curious as to how you could deduce that.
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:28:31
same thing with me. Coinbase all of a sudden is preventing me from buying/selling my own bitcoins.
They won't even accept a temporary driver's license.
I'm working on transferring my bitcoin out of coinbase.

I've been trying to understand what ASICBOOST is. I can't find any place where it's explained. can someone point me to an ELI5 ? Also, is it related to UASF ?
@_date: 2016-02-21 09:46:00
where can I find it ?

Journalists do not often get enough credit for the hard work they put in.

Funny, since Mobutu was from Zaire(nowadays Democratic Republic of Congo), not Nigeria.
