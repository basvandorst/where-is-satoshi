Because Reddit threads aren't TV news broadcasts; they are persistent.  If a story develops quickly it can result in several articles of varying freshness/validity pertaining to the same subject, all bearing the headline "BREAKING."

Does anyone know if a crossfire cable is required to get multiple radeon GPUs to mine?   And when you are mining, do you run two separate miners (i.e. tabs in the GUIminer) to use both cards, or are they recognized as one?

What doesn't make sense about this?  They could pull databases released by hackers from the recent [Sony, Sega, Gawker, PBS, and MtGox hacks]( and simply see if your e-mail is listed in them.

Why do you have to mount?   Can't you just get the address for the wallet, use that for all your mining, and leave it perpetually encrypted?
Unless you are spending the bitcoins, I suppose.

Maybe, but if he was mining back then, I'm sure he still has tons of bitcoins now.

Is there going to be enough computer power just in the transaction incentives to sustain a healthy network?
I guess the question is, how much mining is needed to sustain all the transactions in a fully mature, closed market?

Yeah, trixx is kind of weird.   It only let me go to 300, so I saved it in one of the slots, restarted it, then loaded it... and then it let me go lower.

Think of it this way.  An auctioneer has in his hat a 50 BTC bill.  You and he are alone in a room.  He will give it to you if you guess the number he is thinking of.  The number he's thinking of is incredibly hard to guess.  If you're like me and you have a GTX 285, you get 58 million guesses per second.   But at that rate it will take months to guess the number correctly.
In another room is another auctioneer who is speaking to a whole room of guessers (a pool).  Collectively they make 1 Trillion guesses per second (1000 Gh/s, what [DeepBit]( does right now).  At that rate they guess the right number every ~20min or so.  Then they split the 50BTC proportionally to each person according to how many guesses they made.   Then they start again.
