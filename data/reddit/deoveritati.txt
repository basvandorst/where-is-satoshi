The only thing I could thing of is if friend A makes income in the lowest tax bracket versus friend B who is in a higher tax bracket, then I guess they could gift the friend the money, let him pay capital gains at a lower bracket.
However, I feel like this is dangerously close tax evasion or structuring if friend B reaps rewards from the donations he gave to friend A. But I don't know.

Because it was to be expected in a decentralized unregulated market. The thought, to my understanding, is that it will be difficult to short it in the future because there will be so much money in it that whales will be lost in the day-to-day noise of transactions. But that assumes mass adoption.
And realistically, the people who had enough money to make big movements like that were already rich as hell. There are people who invested very little in the beginning that are rich as hell too now. It is what it is.

It would be closer to 2% monthly to my understanding if you have an apr of ~24%. What wouldn't be good though is if people are going all in to max out their credit cards and either get rich or lose it all and just bankrupt the debt away.
As I've read somewhere, credit card companies love mediocre credit people. People who aren't at risk of bankruptcy but also willing to pay interest.

I think it is a chicken before the egg kind of thing. To have a decentralized stable currency, you need to have a lot of users so its value can't easily be moved by single players/institutions. But you can't suddenly make a new currency and tell everyone to use it and expect they will, so you need to incentivize them to use it.
In this case, miners were being paid more bitcoin in the beginning to incentivize people to secure the networks with the expectation that the value of the coin would grow in value as adoption increased.
Now there are miner fees, so as adoption grows, the volume of those fees should also grew and make the necessity of block rewards less vital. And to deal with the problems of fiat and inflation, the number of bitcoin must be fixed, so the block reward has to be extinguished over time which is found in the halvening mechanism.
I think the halvening was originally intended to keep bitcoin circulation increasing in the beginning to promote adoption and utilization and then curb it on a set schedule to maintain some form of predictability that could be planned around and maintain the deflationary/anti-inflationary aspects of it.
It's been a bit since I've read the white paper, so some or more of this could be inaccurate, but that's my current understanding of it and the reasonings behind it.

I emailed my bank multiple times and called their compliance officer until I got a green light from them after reading some banks had closed accounts over transactions tied to bitcoin exchanges.

One) if it is a traditional, you take a penalty as well as have it taxed.

Three) given that it is speculative and there are numerous other currencies, it is possible that bitcoin might not be the prevailing end all be all cryptocurrency as the technology is developed

If you buy bitcoin, and it increases in value, you are supposed to pay taxes on it when realizing those gains which can take the form of using bitcoin to make a purchase or converting to another currency.
There was a post not too long ago that linked three year old thread with a tax guy explaining in depth all the tax implications. There were some murky areas like "like-kind" exchanges where it is unclear if selling one crypto to buy another would be considered "like-kind" similar to when you sell a house and buy another house with the profits where you aren't taxed on that.

I disagree and don't think banning mining or exchanges is at all comparable to this. In that case, I'd agree it is "essentially" banning bitcoin by eliminating what makes it functional as a currency. You don't need total anonymity for it to function. 
In this specific text, it is talking about "money service businesses" which does not apply to me. And the above text is just saying the business needs to be registered, licensed, following regulations, and not knowingly allowing transactions derived from criminal activities. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:18:14

Most people who hold bitcoin are not considered  a "money services business"  and those who are have to deal with those regulations would be like exchanges or bitcoin ATMs if I had to guess.
This bill is not essentially banning bitcoin at all. It's banning concealment of accounts which is totally different. You sending money from one wallet to another would not be considered money laundering anymore than me handing someone cash would be considered money laundering.

I got in a couple months ago, and the first buy was the hardest for me. Even though I'm confident it'll go up 2x-8x in 2018 (note I'm a nobody on reddit so take that with the biggest grain for salt you can even fathom), it's still a battle for me to not overinvest in case I am wrong but also fighting of the FOMO when seeing it rise an insane amount when I don't.
Just throw whatever you are willing to lose. If it goes up yay. If not, at least losses are tax deductible up to $3k/year. But you haven't lost or gained anything until you actually sell. So put some in and test the waters, read more here and there to learn about the technology and other cryptos and current developments to deal with current and future issues, and then decide for yourself on that prospect if it's too late or not to invest in bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-11 14:54:47
To my understanding, they don't care if transfer bitcoins to wherever because you're not realizing any gain or loss at that point. However, when you purchase something with bitcoin or cash out, that's when you're realizing the gain. In the latter, they'd know where it came from when you deposited the money in the bank. In the former, it'd be less clear to the IRSs and would be tax evasion if left unreported--to my understanding.
Just transferring stuff from one wallet to another doesn't come across as falsifying, concealing, misrepresenting, etc. because there is a record of it still. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:14:42
I have the bitcoin paranoid app and had it set to ding at any 3% change and update every minute.

If say B) is pretty easily answerable.
"THIS average rate of change tells us the value, as defined as the monetary worth, has declined between January 1st, 2018 and June 1st, 2018."
The above is within the scope and accurate, which in math, is important to consider. I think a nice follow-up question would have been to ask the price of it since inception until now or to "zoom out" to further reinforce that you always need to keep in mind the scope of statements when making any kind of inference on it and extrapolating beyond the scope of the information may lead to innacuracies.
@_date: 2019-03-08 11:22:16
I disagree with you saying nobody sane would buy them these days because that is trying to time the market. There is a paper that analyzes a hypothetical person who invests at the worst points in history and still comes out ahead over the long term (~30 years iirc since that's a typical length used for these kind of studies).
You have to be right twice when timing the market, you have to know for sure you are at or near the bottom and that you are at or near the top when selling. Without knowledge, you are losing dividends and gains along the way to the new top. That's why DCA is such a nice thing.
I think it is important to be diversified. That won't get you rich quick or isn't a sexy story, but it's a pretty safe and sane tactic generally speaking with its history and models we have for it compared to anything else we have.
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:55:24
I'm not an economist, so perhaps I'm about to show my ignorance here, but I don't see how it matters whether the supply of the currency is fixed or not. If the market declares a house is worth 100 btc, then that is the demand determining the price. Likewise, if the market declares that a job is worth only 10 btc per annum, then that's the demand of the job market determining that.
If overall demand for btc to goes up, then the purchasing power of btc will also go up, so I'd expect a proportional decrease over time in salaries and housing costs, but I would still expect a house to be valued at 10x the wage simply because the housing market and job market demands are creating that gap and is independent of the currency.
@_date: 2019-03-29 10:24:05
This is less of an issue with the USD and more of an issue of the housing market bubbling. Even if we went to a full bitcoin economy, you would see the same thing of having a 10 btc salary but a 100 btc house.
My understanding is the average/median annual wage has out paced the proportional cost of most things with the 3 biggest exceptions being housing, healthcare, and education which have dramatically outpaced wage increases.

There was recently an article out that analyzed the trades of exchanges and concluded 95% of the trading volume were artificially inflated, primarily through wash trading-the simultaneous buying and selling of something--which makes it look as though a lot of money is flowing in and out presumably to other parties when in reality it is just flowing in from say Party A to the exchange and flowing back out to Party A from the exchange, so no real meaningful activity is occurring because demand isn't actually increasing as the trading volume reported from the exchange would imply.

Some credit cards allow temporary numbers to be generated to do a transaction like if you want to buy something off a sketchy site you think could be compromised. I also get text alerts every single transaction that takes place from my credit cards and can reverse fraudulent activity whereas bitcoin it is gone forever.
With fiat, I have a couple banks that makes it incredibly unlikely from being cut off from two buckets for liquid assets. In the meantime, they can monitor my transactions to let me know of fraudulent activity or if transactions went through.
I'm pretty okay with a stable inflation, so yeah, I think I'd be cool with it if bitcoin had that too.
I think there are several good reasons to keep using fiat: widely accepted, easy to use, cash back/rewards cards, low volatility, etc.
This isn't to say bitcoin isn't good, but they can coexist with their own advantages until if and when one becomes 100% better than the other.
@_date: 2019-03-27 15:16:53
Probably an unpopular opinion, but I don't see this as a big issue or a strong case for a need for bitcoin. One day every couple weeks during most people's sleeping hours they do maintenance for their services or whatever. I can't really think of a scenario that I couldn't use a credit card for if I needed the funds quickly or of an issue that couldn't wait 24-48 hrs to use the bank the next business day.
That isn't to say that bitcoin doesn't have an advantage here, but I wouldn't call that a need compared to a transaction getting shut down because your bank doesnt like the party you're wanting to do business with.

Perhaps I'm in the wrong here, but doesn't it depend on how full the mempool is and less on the price? So like the run up to $20k was very fast and the fees were steep because demand had spiked incredibly so that you had to pay an insane fee to guarantee being in the next block.
However, the value is set just based on how much is someone willing to pay and not necessarily how fast people are willing to pay for it. So if we went up to $20k slowly then that shows us that the market is now valuing btc more than before but not in a frenzy to fill up the mempool to force ridiculous fees to be charged.
So I'm thinking it depends on if we assume the mempool is full or not. Otherwise, if you can still get in a 1 sat/byte, then the fee would be 10-100x more than it is now simply because the value of a satoshi also increased 10-100x.

I think most credit cards treat it as a cash advance now, and some will shut down your line of credit if they detect it being used to buy crypto. On top of that, I think coin ase charges like a 3-5% convenience fee or so for buying with credit.

Do you have a source for that? I'll try to look for one myself later when I have time. I could see that if we were talking averages instead of median net worth which could be skewed by the ultra wealthy and misleading.
Edit: 
Here is the closest thing I could find, and it is based on a 2016 survey from the Federal Reserve. If we assume that nearly all the boomers are included in the 55 and up brackets, we see the average net worth is definitely over a million but the median is far, far less at ~200-250k which I'm guessing most of that is tied to the household and not held in equities or bonds.

To recover at least what I put into it probably. I'm sure I'll reassess at the time what I want to do. If there is news and breakthroughs to support it, I'd like to think I'd hold. If there isn't anything new, and it is climbing, I'd like to think there'd be a pullback at some point in this theoretical scenario, but everything will.be a gamble and have risks associated with it regardless of holding or selling.
So the idea is keep DCAing even after pulling out what I've put into it and go from there. I think it's good to pick price points and plan percentages to take emotions out of it.

Just out of curiosity, what tax, if any, would you think is better? If none, how do you think roads, municipal buildings, etc should be funded?

I'm by no means an expert. I first bought in at $5500 like 6 weeks ago, if that. There is still a lot I don't understand. That being said, there are definitely good threads in this subreddit if you find them between the memes or in the comments that will teach you about the technology, ways to store your crypto, and the advantages and disadvantages of say bitcoin versus ethereum vs whatever. You can also find information on what a fork is, what the implications are of each one is, etc.

Let the following assumptions be true: Bitcoin=A, Ripple=B, Dogecoin=C, Ethereum=D, and Monero=E.
Equation 1: AB-C=34
Equation 2: A+C+D=6
Equation 3: C+B+E=16
Equation 4: A+BE=56
Equation 5: E+D-B=5
Equation 6: E-C-D=x
Add Equations 1 and 2 to get Equation 7: AB+A+D=40
Add Equations 1 and 3 to get Equation 8: AB+B+E=50
Subtract Equations 7 and 8 to get A-E+D-B=-10. Substitute equation 5 to get A-5=-10; A=-5. Equation 2 can now be written as C+D=11
Add Equation 3 and Equation 5 to get C+D+2E=21. Substitute modified equation 2 to get 11+2E=21.; E=5
Now we can solve Equation 4 for B, which is now -5+5B=56. B=12.4
Now we can solve for C using equation 3: C+12.4+5=16; C=-1.4
Now we can solve for D using equation 2 again; -5-1.4+D=6; D=12.4, I think this may be where the hint 1 dogecoin=1dogecoin comes into play.
Now we can solve for x using Equation 6: 5+1.4-12.4=-6

SPOILERS AHEAD
An enslaved alien race (saiyans) exists where the overlord(a different kind of alien) sent low level saiyans to planets to become giant apes of massive power to wipe out the inhabitant, so the planet would be fit to sell.
The main protagonist (Goku) was sent to earth as a baby to wipe it out. He was discovered by an older man who took care of him but managed to drop Goku into a ravine where he hit his head. Prior to this incident, Goku was very unruly but then he became very kind and good.
He grew up to be kind, loving, and an astounding martial artist. Over the years, more and more powerful threats have threatened earth, the galaxy, and even the universe, but Goku loves to reach his ceiling and break through them, achieving new power levels/forms. He never backs away from a challenge, is very merciful, and loves food.
Dragon balls are 7 numbered spheres that can be collected to summon a dragon that grants a wish where after the granting the dragon balls are scattered across the earth. Obviously, this attracts many malicious people/aliens.
Also, all saiyans are named after vegetables as far as I know. There is a bit more to the show than this since there are a ton of different sagas, but that's a shorter version.

No problem! It can be slow paced, have a bit of filler, some oddly places jokes, but it has some very memorable and good scenes.
It can also be repetitive in the conflict resolution design, spend too much screen time either recapping or doing stupidly long camera pans of two combatants staring each other down, and many enemies are down right ridiculous.

Tbf, reddit has pointed me to a lot of high quality information and straight up guided me in a lot of ways in regards to finances. I definitely verified the information, but it was quality from reddit. But you also have to look at the context of the subreddit. Asking if you should buy bitcoin in a bitcoin subreddit doesn't sound like a person looking for impartial, sound advice.

I mean, it did just drop like 30% since I've bought in, so I've experienced the volatility. Not to say it's anywhere close to what's it's crashed to before. 
I've also experienced two subreddits mocking each other with one proclaiming a conspiracy to overthrow bitcoin, and the other proclaiming that bitcoin proponents are basically traditionalist that don't want an "improved" technology. On top of that, even with the other at surface value sounding more reasonable, I find myself believing in the conspiracy, and I'm not typically cynical enough to believe in those.
Point is, I've already realized it isn't sunshine and rainbows, but I'm happy to be involved with a new technology regardless of whether or not bitcoin or some other crypto becomes the dominant currency.

Here are my thoughts and probably isn't as popular of one in this sub. Follow the r/personalfinance flow chart. Once you have your emergency fund, at least 15% of your income going towards retirement, and are rid of high interest debt, then I think one should explore "moonshot" investments and I'd not let it exceed 1-10% of a person's portfolio and only after the person has thoroughly researched it and form their own opinion.
I think this best balances financial self-preservation so you don't have to sell at a loss to make ends meet and also exposes you to emerging markets that can potentially boom.

His uncle isn't suggesting diversification though. He is suggesting cashing out, which would be the opposite of diversification since you're now storing your wealth in fewer assets (2 vs 1 in this case).
On top of that, his uncle says what goes up must come down, so I'm almost willing to wager that his uncle doesn't even believe in investing in mutual funds or anything that provide a ton of diversification.

I didn't buy at 20k. I had bought from 5.5-16k at that point. I'm a DCA person in all forms of investing. I don't flinch if it drops 60%+ for no apparent reason, but when the people who have seen the bubble burst multitudes of times more than i have and start talking as if there is a very real possibility it will not recover, then my confidence was shaken.
In the end, I'm a calculated risk taker. Even when I had been telling people irl that I think the bubble will pop, take a couple years to recover, and I will cash out some when and if it gets up to 60-80k, my confidence was shaken. If I'm wrong, I'm not hurting too much. If I'm right, I won't be rich, but I'll be better off for sure.

I guess that'd depend on how much emphasis you put on care. Currently I keep chunking some each month regardless of price. Right now I'm in the hole. I've budgeted assuming this is wasted money to begin with, so for all intents and purposes it doesn't exist to me. Would I prefer bitcoin price to be $100k, sure. Is it changing my game plane even though it isnt? Nope. Am I an OG? Nope. Just hit 1 year in the market in like october. It's a fun a little roller-coaster to observe, and I get little dopamine hits when I see the price swing in either direction. If it goes up, I see the value go up. If I see it go down, then I think of the potential for it to go back up and the resulting gains from it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:16:53
I guess I was focusing too much on the "you see 4 kinds of people when prices are down" bit. I definitely see people who seem to wreak of delusional unfalsifiable theories that is spouted no matter what. You see a lot about the whales as if they were moby dick and institutional money and stuff and spouted as of it were fact woth little to nothing to back it up. But I also see a fair amount of people who say that no one knows anything, and it can go up or down, and that they don't care which directions it is in--most often I see people say they are in it "for the tech" when they fall into this camp.
I think there is plenty of level headed people. They probably are just lurkers by and large.

Everyone knows if you can perfectly time bottoms and tops then that is optimal. Sick it's basically impossible to make that determination, then DCA is a good way of mitigating risk and providing exposure so you didn't mistakenly buy too close to the top or sell too close to the bottom.

He was saying they were waiting for bitcoin to get 6 to 7 figures per bitcoin before using it. They didn't even say the word win. And I don't think it is unreasonable for an average Joe to keep 5-10% of their portfolio in moon shot investments and the rest in index funds and all that jazz.

To be fair, I read on a daily basis, and I don't comment much because you can get flamed depending on who gets to your comment first. And this sub can be pretty quick to downvote others too, especially if you are asking "if x, y, and z, then does this mean or not blah" where blah is something wrong and negative towards bitcoin.
But if the price moves up 5% in a day, then everyone gets notifications on their apps and speculates on the price lol. I also don't see much technical discussion, and the ones I do see are so far above my, a layperson's, head that I couldn't even hope to participate.

Not every student has a negative net worth after college.

That's not necessarily true. Take for example if you have all even numbers in an infinite set of data.

Depending on what you mean, I disagree. The r/personalfinance flow chart is a pretty darn good guide if you're interested.

I don't think it's immature to say you didn't fuck up by not selling at the ATH because it could have just as easily kept mooning because of whatever positive speculative forces could have existed. It's easy to say people fucked up when looking with hindset, but with the knowledge they had at the time I feel an argument could be made for either case on whether it was stupid or not or if it was just greedy or whatever.
However, I also think it depends on how much of your portfolio is in it and whether you could afford to lose it. If it's 1% of your networth, and you aren't living paycheck to paycheck, then who cares? If it's 200% of your networth because you refinanced your house to trade with leverage, well, yeah you made multiple mistakes.

As it currently stands, if you bought a property for 1 btc, you experienced a taxable event and will experience a capital gain/loss depending on what you originally purchased that 1 btc for. So if you bought 1 btc for $10,000,then that's your basis. If you bought a house for 1 btc when it is at $100,000 USD, you experienced $90,000 in capital gains and will pay taxes on that.
When you sell a house, you also experience a taxable event (though I think there is an exemption if you've lived in it for two out of the last five years, but we'll ignore that for now). If you sold it for 2 btc, then I believe you'd be taxed on the capital gains/loss on that using the original purchase price ($100,000 or 1 btc at the time) against the usd value of the 2 btc you are currently selling it for. So even if btc dropped to say $60,000 at this point, your cash equivalent selling price would be $120k, which is $20k more than what you started with, so you'll pay taxes on that $20k.
This is my understanding of it. I am not a tax expert though.

To be fair, I don't think it's expected for the head of something to do the actual research. In my world, we have our manager who tells the PhDs to go forth and science and provide updates, so she can report to her managers how our organization is performing, what we are doing, and if we need support.
Given the manager is supposed to be balancing multitudes of projects, they may not have time to investigate it, and it would make sense for them to ask someone they know has some insight into block chain technique that may already have a head start on a deep dive and can summarize nicely use cases for block chain or bitcoin for the business.

And yet half the year we've been at approximately half the value we are now, so there is still a lot of room for it to drop and it still have been profitable if anyone entered into the market during that time frame.
If someone expands their scope to the beginning of bitcoin, it shouldn't be any surprise to anyone the wild swings it can and has made, so I don't get why someone would have a "gut feeling" things like this would happen when it has happened repeatedly for a decade now unless they are very new to the market; in which case I go back to the profitability point in my first paragraph.

I think there are always signs there if you look deep enough. There have been speculations of a recession for a while after having an 8-10 year bull run.
I doubt we are heading for a "collapse". Even if there were a collapse, I doubt crypto would be the safe haven because it isn't exactly user friendly enough for people to want to bother with it or trust it. Like if most of the public doesn't understand it now or associate it with a ponzi scheme, I doubt without some great marketing a majority would turn to it in times of travesty. I'm sure some may use it as a haven as seen in Venezuela, but depending on how big of a collapse we are speculating on could vastly change whether it could or couldn't be effective.
Please stop talking as if we are most certainly going to crash. You don't know. No one does save for perhaps organizations with enough funds to deliberately try to tank it on their own and are planning to in the near future. It's like being a doomsday prepper prepping for all these what if scenarios on the off chance that you might be right and be able to use your bunker stashed with 20 years of food ammunition to fight off the undead.
My thoughts for everyone to best prepare if we are anticipating in a hypothetical collapse? Keep a responsible diversified portfolio, keep 5-10% of assets in a high risk asset if you want, maintain marketable and desirable skills, and keep on keeping on if you can. Dollar cost average, and you'll likely be good.

Yeah prop 65 basically says what you quoted. Just emphasize "contains". It is possible for a product to have permissible levels of a carcinigenic or reproductive hazard chemical such that it you are at no risk based on the studies performed by the federal government, but since it "contains" the chemical at detectable--not necessarily even quantifiable--quantities, prop 65 requires the warning whereas federal regulations wouldn't if it was below whatever exposure or regulatory guidelines they use.
For example, products can still be made with up to 1% of asbestos with no warning according to the federal government (though that may not be the best example because I imagine but don't have a source to show that even 1% of asbestos can be dangerous but may have been a political compromise to balance safety and manufacturing since it's a useful substance), but it'd require a prop 65 warning label.
That being said, prop 65 also as safe harbor levels for some of the chemicals listed so that not everything had to have a prop 65 warning.

In short, it is the withdrawing of all your bitcoin from exchanges to see if they are truly solvent and can account for it all.
If they fail to remain solvent, it further reinforces the idea of "not your key, not your bitcoin". If they remain solvent, it shows either there wasn't enough traction in the event to make an impact or they are managing the bitcoin responsibly and must maintain that or risk going insolvent in future Proof of Key events.
That's my understanding of the event.
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:56:24
They didn't say anything about buying bitcoin. They said withdraw to wallets you control.
For something a bit more analogous, the event would be similar to coordinating an event with all the customers of a bank with going in the bank and withdrawing all their funds in cash to see if the bank was actually solvent and could provide it all back on demand.

He means precisely that. There can only ever be 22m bitcoins mined. That's one aspect that makes it deflationary. If it being widely adopted and all 21m were in circulation, demand would drive up the price of btc. However, all 21m btc are infinitely divisible which is why people talk in units of satoshi where 1 satoshi=10^-6 btc I think. This property allows it to accommodate &gt;21m people even if all 21m have been mined.
The protocol/consensus rules limit it.

The trinity study showed that the 4% withdrawal rate had a 95% success rate over a 30 year horizon with success being defined as having a positive account at the end. Most (all?) of the 5% that failed did so because of there was an economic downturn within the first 5 years of retirement. This is why a 5-year bond tent is recommended to get over that hump and minimize that risk.
The trinity study also assumes a straight inflation-adjusted 4% of the starting balance every year whereas most humans would likely have a "guardrail"withdrawal rate during economic downturns and pull out &lt;4% during really tight years.
It's also worth noting that of the 95% that succeeded, the majority had a final balance that was greater than the initial balance even after factoring in inflation.
