 And this comment takes the post full circle

It's on Netflix right? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:14:12
Can you imagine what a short squeeze could look like on a thing like bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:04:40
Yeah but where does bitcoin diamond fit in?  Is that the dog, the neighbor, the illegitimate dumpster baby?  We need to know. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:36:11
I don't know.  But something did.  I think one of the exchanges is screwed up but I'm too dumb to understand. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:13:07
Maybe this dip is the result of everyone spending all their money on presents instead of coin
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:18:25
13th floor gone. 
On to the next one

Fwiw, I an a Nigerian Prince and I need you to send me bitcoin so that I can sweep my wallet.  I will pay you 10 times whatever you pay me, I promise. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:18:59
This would be a more accurate depiction of all cryptos today if you put it on a loop. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:24:26
What alts are you talking about?  Looks like they're all down big except ripple.  These prices are a great Christmas present. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:42:33
My FIL doesn't like bitcoin either when I mention it.  Why are there so many BTC haters? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:29:51
I thought it was too expensive at 200.  I suck. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:27:02
 Yes
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:01:51
That's true
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:28:45
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:53:08
For each bitcoin I receive, I will return to you 10 doge coins
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:34:04
Nope, just a quick bounce.  I'm trying for 10

He doesn't have money.  It's either her money or their money.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:26:16
The dip is on aisle 9
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:54:12
Lol.  Do you belong to a local makerspace?  3d printers are great with arduinos.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:07:14
Nice. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:33:55
No way to retail. You have to change the code to fit your WiFi settings.  It's easy to do but i got the code from someone else who shared it anyways.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:32:54
The big short will come right before they announce plans to make bitcoin illegal in the US.  Big money always has control of politics.  Makes me sick.  I hope the shorts get burned with a big ass bear trap. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:00:35
8700.... still rising 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:57:16
I will look into this.  I think it's possible
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:19:19
 One in my area charges something like 12-15%
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:21:48
You mean because of the holiday? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:53:46
Don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose
Start with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.
Use Coinbase to get started
Ignore short-term market fluctuations, focus on long-term goals.
If you find Altcoins you like research them. Keep these to 10–20% of your portfolio."
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:12:27
Nice.  My son is getting a 3d printer for Christmas but I haven't put it together yet.  The one I got is supposed to take hours to assemble.  I'm going to print the bitcoin guy an d some coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:32:10
That's really cool and could make these types of things sellable. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:55:52
Sure send me your wallet info and I'll email you if it changes.  /s
Don't do that. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:24:21
Coinbase was pretty painless to use for eth, but they only let you buy $300/wk via credit card until you've spent over 1k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:31:59
Many people see this as a bad thing because it allows traders to short bitcoin.  Actually it's a great thing for bitcoin. 
It adds legitimacy and helps stabilize from crashes.  When a crash occurs, traders will cover their shorts which brings the price back up.  The legitimacy will help keep Washington from prohibiting the trading of bitcoin. 
Manipulation however is the new problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:18:31
 Yes!!!  I have my bitcoin display next to my coffee maker.  What a way to start the day. 
To the moon. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:01:33
I agree.  Do you think the government will make any progress in their fight against cryptos? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:07:28
*hodl ftfy
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:04:18
Yeah.  I'm with you, except I don't think bitcoin can be traded with the same technical analysis tools as stocks.  Buy and hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:07:20
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:35:11
 I'm too young to sell at every drop.  Better idea is to buy every drop. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:04:47
Yeah right,  5k is time to back the truck in and load up. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:05:53
It shows bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin diamond, and ethereum.  Updates every 10 seconds.  I'm going to make a better enclosure soon. 
Link to instructions: 
Edit:  ill send anyone a custom version with up to 4 cryptos installed for $40 in BTC : )
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:07:09
I concur.  Coinbase is the cats pajamas.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:38:52
What do you think will be the effect on other cryptocurrencies? I can't understand why no one is enthusiastic over more than 1 crypto.  To me that would be like having your entire IRA invested in one stock. I would like to have a little of each crypto, a lot of each crypto lol.

 Dips on aisle 11

 Well don't leave us hanging, how much did you send baby pearl? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:52
But where can I buy ramen noodles with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:06:42
 My favorite high quality gif on Reddit
