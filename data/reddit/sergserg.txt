Wont need a bruteforce - i know what the password will likely be. In fact i'm nearly certain of what the password would be. What i'm missing is what the hell this file is. It obviously either encrypted or hashed in some kind of way, and I always thought it was my multibit backup private key, but it's not importing... not sure if its corrupt or what not. 
Could it be AES encrypted?

created a new wallet, tried import private keys on the file. the file has no file extension because i must have renamed it. 
Here's an example of what it contains, it's 344 characters long, just the one big string. starts with q82la8fEN+4h/Thip6YF ...etc... ends with pc5wVbrg==
What does it look like?

okay, update. the "private key file" (thats if its a private key file) was created / last modified on the same date as the date i opened my multibit wallet, so it's likely to be from my multibit wallet rather than my old blockchain wallet. this gives me hope that not all is lost!

i tried base64 'decrypting' the same 'key' with a few characters missing, and it says "[Exception... "String contains an invalid character"  code: "5" nsresult: "0x80530005 (InvalidCharacterError)"  location: "&lt;unknown&gt;"]
does that mean that that mumbo jumbo is actually a successfully 'decrypted' phrase? (what i mean, is that if it wasnt a proper base64 decryptable phrase, maybe it would give an error instead right?)

Don't feel safe entering my private key into a website like that... the private key file is 344 characters long. doesn't start with a 5. what do i do next?
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:04:52
doesnt work, says it doesnt recognise the file
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:12:40
don't think it's base64 because how would i have obtained a base64 key? tried the atob in firefox web developer, successfully 'decrypts' your phrase into that "man is distinguished" string. Tried it on my key, nothing but a bunch of mumbo jumbo. ie "«Í¥kÇÄ7î!ý8b§¦@ ^
 &lt;C|ø Q¡ìÑªëffz{Ø...continued..."
before i started using multibit, i used blockchain.info, it could have been the private key from the old wallet? (redacted - see post below)
also, could it be something like AES? what are the possibilities that it could be encrypted with?
@_date: 2014-04-29 13:31:55
Tried that. Didn't seem to work. "the private keys unlock failed - could not understand address in import file"
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:24:09
other people are saying that i have an encrypted private key backup, because it ends with "=". what do i do with this? 
@_date: 2014-04-29 13:24:20
they don't start with 5's. what next?
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:20:16
okay, so what do i do with that?
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:43:46
the private keys unlock failed. The error was "could not understand address in import file"
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:19:55
okay, will try this
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:20:02
sigh, what a waste :( will keep trying anyway and if worst comes to worst, i might engage the services of a professional
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:10:03
its not that, its got no other information except for that string
@_date: 2014-04-29 13:36:11
the private key file with the characters "==", is that normal?
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:19:47
yep it is
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:10:11
and it wont open obviously
