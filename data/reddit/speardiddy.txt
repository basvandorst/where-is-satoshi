Partly true. First there will be a chain split, but then as soon as one non-segwit miner includes one of the "anyone-can-spend" segwit transactions there will be a hard fork since this is invalid on the segwit chain but valid on the other.
It does not even have to be miner initiated. Anyone can create a transaction that does that and it will be mined by any miner running non-segwit software.

You don't seem to be against it. 


UASF of SW would still need 51% of the hashing power. So if a block size increase was deployed as UASF with 75% hashing power you would be fine with that?


The miners are not obliged to do anything. They are supposed to be selfish. They will do what they think will earn them the most money. It's what makes block chain technology work. Right now they seem to think that the economic majority supports a block size increase and so they will go with that instead of SegWit, because it makes more financial sense for them.
Edit: One more thing. I'm quite certain that no miner is actually against SegWit. But they see SegWit without block size increase as only benefiting operators of 2nd layers, eating into the miners future profits.

You take for granted that the exchanges will follow along and only run segwit compliant software. In this scenario (soft fork with &lt;51% hashing power) all other nodes, including all versions of core before 0.13.1, will follow the longest chain, i.e. the non-segwit chain. 
Every SPV-wallet will follow the longest chain, so most wallets for mobile phones.
There are of course ways around this, but the default for every user that does nothing is to only be able to spend their coins on the non-segwit chain.
So not only will a majority of the hashing power be mining on the longest chain, but a majority of the users will only see that chain as valid. Do you think the exchanges will be fine with only being able to serve the select few who go out of their way to run segwit compliant wallets?

Activating it with less than 51% of the hashing power would with all likelihood create a permanent fork. If that is the goal you might as well hard fork.


True. Guess it would be a UAHF then.

Activating it with &lt;51% would have all the non SegWit nodes, so all nodes with version number &lt; 0.13.1, using the longest chain. So if activated before majority hashing power you will create a permanent SegWit fork with minority hashing power. 
Sounds more like the dreaded hard fork to me.

I think you need to read up on what the SegWit soft fork does. 
User activated or miner activated, it will orphan every non segwit block. 
There is a reason the activation threshold is set to 95%.
Edit: Maybe I should be more clear and call it, as luke above, "orphaning". SegWit nodes and miners will "orphan" all non segwit blocks by ignoring them. It's what gregg calls "a feature".

Just for clarification, does everyone understand that if the UASF is triggered with less than 51% hash power that will create a hard fork? I'm not saying it should not be done, but you need to know that will be the outcome.

Small correction. The percentage of "mining power that at the moment do not feel that SegWit is in their best interest" should be ~75%.

Yes, Jihan is the road, with toll gates, but LN is a bus. SW is the bus lane. Jihan can only charge per vehicle passing the toll gates. Forcing everyone to take the bus because the road is full is not fair. Jihan wants more lanes on the road. With more lanes more cars and busses can go on the road. Taking the bus will still be better/cheaper for many people, but it will still be possible to take the car. This will get more vehicles on the road and more money collected att the toll gates.

The attack you are so against, orphaning blocks not mined with BU, is the exact same type of attack you are a proponent of, i.e UASF where blocks not mined with SW will be orphaned. Congrats on the double standards.

Why can Ethereum do it but not bitcoin? Are you saying that Ethereum is more capable than bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-05 03:09:06
First, don't try to send it all at once. Try sending half of it. 
Second, you can try setting the fee yourself under Advanced Send. Since your transaction is probably huge, you should set it to something like 0.01 BTC. If the transactions are old and you're lucky it might be mined in a couple of days.
You can at least try it, nothing to lose.

The key thing is what Craig is "attacking" Greg for. I.e. that Greg is wrong in saying that the key is back dated.
