When I set it up lightning was newish and I couldn't find any good guides to set it up. I'd like to set it up when I get a chance.
The pi is also running off the USB port on the back of the PC, it provides power even when the PC is off.

The enclosure is from a 2TB Seagate backup plus slim. However the drive inside is a 1TB WD pulled from my laptop because I upgraded that to a SSD. Most drives have the amperage stated on the label somewhere, the WD says 800mA, the Seagate says 1.0A

I invested $0 to make this as I already had a rpi sitting around not being used and an external hdd sitting around not being used. If you needed to buy the hardware this could be made for about $80 (rpi - $35. Hdd - $40. Case - $5)
It's not a LN node but I would like to make it one.

Not with your regular desktop PC, no. You have to buy specialised "ASIC" mining gear that costs alot and even then with the cost of electricity, increasing difficulty, ever changing price of bitcoin, it might or might not be worth it.

Bought a 50$ used PC off Craigslist, and installed ubuntu server. Q9550, 6 GB ram, 250gb HDD. Really no need to spend 500. Save the other 90% and go search Craigslist.

The solution actually comes in the packaging with the rubik's cube.

I don't expect this to last a few months, or long enough to recoup the cost of the GPU, either the price will drop, or difficulty will go up. Either way its a few extra bucks in my pocket now.

After the electricity cost of $0.22/KWh, I'm making ~$5 a day off mining with my GTX 1070. Not bad for something I had anyways to play video-games with.

Well, it seems you didn't read that link I posted, so I'll just ELI5 for you here.
The person will send a fake check in the mail, I will cash it, and then they will pick up the item, a few weeks after the bank will discover that the check is a fake, and take the money out of my bank account.

Hi, It seems that you don't know about the scam using Cashiers checks, you might want to read this so it will never happen to you.

I don't know what that has to do with this, but that's a nice backyard roller coaster. Reminds me of [this.](
