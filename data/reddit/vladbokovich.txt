Says I've got an 18hr delay wait but it's been nearly 48hrs now
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:52:51
Yep, now its saying infinite, I'm trying to send £600 worth really pissing me off. Think it'll get through in the next couple of days when things have settled, although I ideally want to sell it before futures come out

I don't understand what a bitcoin fork is? Why do they occur?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:16:09
Oh I see, how do you know there's a network change coming up?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:57:54
Of course but if you've got enough money to buffer yourself.....
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:15:05
Oh, thought you'd like put it 100 with a 1:100 leverage whilst still having like 10k in the account (or whatever) to buffer for the drops
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:29:19
My bitcoins are in blockchain. Am I alright?
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:37:18
If you look at the .com bubble and Nasdaq prices you could plot a log scale with it because it has an exponential growth similar to bitcoin before if burst. Don't see how plotting it on log scale makes a difference
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:11:19
Thanks so much for the information. Really helping me with exit strategies
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:45:30
Looking at Nasdaq graphs and btc they look pretty similar, I reckon btc will last a lot longer though before it crashes
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:50:43
Oh right, misunderstood 
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:45:11
Thanks for the info 
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:56:19
Ye they'd probs make it expensive. Just don't want them to vault it incase bitcoin crashes and they liquidate and hold all my gold back 
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:49:13
Why is it not a bubble?

Thanks guys. Is there the option to have it shipped to the uk? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:44:41
It is a mad trading stock I agree. It's survived everything, but there is a lot of signs indicating that it is in a bubble, don't think it'll burst any time soon but it does look like it's in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:12:07
Using some trading platforms and set the time scale so that you can view it it's whole life, the graph trend is exponential 
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:40:45
So yes or no for blockchain being safe?
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:10:43
Thanks, I'll look at these. Is there the option to have it shipped to the uk?
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:43:36
It's been looking like a bubble for a long time. Doubt this blip will cause it to burst, reckon it'll keep going up for a bit longer. Just wondering when it'll burst. Guessing your take is never?
