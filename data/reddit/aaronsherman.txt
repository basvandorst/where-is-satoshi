Note that the article points out that he never claimed to be Satoshi.
He claims he was "running bitcoin" in 2009, but it's unclear what he meant by that. Early bitcoin was a community, not just a single person's efforts.

You're advocating in for the idea that not having a secure and anonymous way to donate shouldn't be a deterrent from doing so. Honestly, I'm kind of shocked it's gone so well for you...

"To what human-behavior are you referring when you use each of these phrases"


Not a behavior. The extant body of law in the jurisdiction where the arrest happened.


Not a behavior. The Tor-only Web site called Silk Road which existed as a black market exchange for goods and on which Bitcoin was the only accepted method of payment. It is a referred to as a "dark site" because it was not available to any non-Tor user.


Not a behavior. Thought obviously the word, "tons" is a hyperbolic characterization by me, the Silk Road definitely was a hotbed of drug trafficking. According to Wikipedia, about 70% of the products offered were contraband drugs.


The "line" in question is the law. Stepping over it is a rather obvious and common metaphor used to refer to violating said laws. I didn't think that was obscure. You seem to be getting needlessly pedantic, here.


It also doesn't make it not illegal, so I'm not sure I see the point. "thing-event" has that smell about it, of someone trying to convince themselves of something convoluted and otherwise obviously absurd...


No, "legal" was used to classify slavery with respect to the law, much as it was used to classify marijuana before it became "illegal" to possess and before it became "legal" to possess in varying amounts in various US states. None of this bears on the point that at any given point in time in any given jurisdiction the legality of a thing can be researched with relative ease. Nor does it bear on the fact that advertising your currency exchange on a dark site used to sell illegal drugs in the jurisdiction in which you reside is kind of obviously going to land you in jail.

They didn't fail. Crypto *was* a munition up until then. That's when the government finally gave up because it was beginning to pose a real risk to the nascent ecommerce world, and some huge multinationals were leaning on them to change the rules.

I find answers like this one to be worrisomely naive:


How are you defining "highly competent"? I would argue that if someone's career path involved becoming an educator evaluator, then the definition of "competent" will be irrelevant to the education of students.
Instead, I would suggest that metrics should be determined on which to objectively assess the success of *students* not *educators*. If students fare well relative to their peers, then the education system has at least not utterly failed them. If they fare poorly then it has. If it has, then the educators responsible for such students should be considered failed educators.
No assessment of "competence" of any overseer is required. No standardized test results are required. Only a set of metrics for evaluating quality of life are required, and it turns out [we already have those](

Then avoid all online search. They're all complying with Federal requirements. Some comply out of hand. Some, like Google, comply after bringing suit and losing and still manage to push the envelope in terms of reporting to its users.
I trust the company that works to maintain my trust.
Duck Duck Go has less saved history which is nice, but I am not worried about that history being subpoenaed, as there's nothing there that I feel the need to hide from the authorities.
It's warrantless "wire"taps that bother me, and not using Google search doesn't change that policy.

That wasn't really the topic, since we were taking about privacy, and Google doesn't share any of those details with their partners (I know, I work for one of those partners). If you don't like ads then sure, use a service that doesn't have ads, but don't say that it's because of privacy concerns.

Can you explain what you mean by this and, specifically, what you felt it had to do with what I said?
Are you suggesting that I was wrong and that these are not the law of the land? Are you suggesting that advertising your bitcoin exchange on the dark site that has tons of illegal drugs for sale isn't stepping over the line into a violation of those laws? Are you mis-reading what I'm writing to be (regardless of my stated provisos) an endorsement of said laws?
You haven't given us enough information to go on...

I think you've already made up your mind on this topic, and it's definitely not a bitcoin-related topic. If you really want to continue, I would suggest that you take it to and PM me so I know it's there.
Otherwise, I think we've hijacked this thread more than sufficiently.

I was discussing a point of view, not a conclusion, but that would be my own personal conclusion, yes. More generally, I think it behoves us not to be too absolute in any position that we take.

If every one of your peers does more or less the same except for you and some classmates who all shared the same teacher, what do you think the result should be? I think that whoever that teacher is should be praised or called to account depending on which way the needle swung.
I don't think that you can compare two towns with different socioeconomic, ethnic or cultural makeups in a vacuum, but surely we can learn something by looking at the students, no?
Edit: two things. I should point out that I like this guy. Naive? Sure, but that's curable, selfish bastards are rarely curable. Second, good point. I think it's useful to look at the data, but you have a point that caution is advisable.

I am made somewhat sad that this is a hurdle, though I am beginning to understand why it is after about a year of being a Freemason. I'm a deist and a former atheist/agnostic who still bristles sometimes at what I call "lots of big G" in Freemasonry. So much of what we do doesn't strictly have to be focused on deity, but I do get the difficulty of mapping the concepts of Freemasonry, especially in later degrees of the York and Scottish Rites to a non-deity-centric worldview.
Religion, though abstracted away from any one faith, is fundamental to who we are and what we do. If you aren't willing to play ball with that worldview, joining wouldn't likely be a pleasant experience for you or the Lodge.

Seriously, though, if there is one Masonic conspiracy, it's this: raising the awareness of good men to the world around them and letting them act on that as their conscience dictates.

I've worked with currency exchange folks... The Bitcoin community is just morphing into an analog of any other currency market. Doge has the benefit of being relatively insulated from such forces for now.

I attended a troubled school at one point as well. It sounds like you had it worse, but I can't accept that no teacher would be exceptional when measured by the years w stick of their student's accomplishments (even if those accomplishments were simply staying out of jail.)
But... Let's assume that every teacher measures up the same in that school.  That's not a problem. Everyone is doing more or less the same, so no action can be taken.

I always thought of conversations about financial regulation that involved the term "efficient market" to be akin to discussions of broken glass that involve the term "chew, then swallow."
It's true that you're discussing the right metric for improving throughput, but you might want to consider the state you're in after you've been passed through the system.

The end of the article suggests that you should complain to Apple. Certainly do that if you wish, but the far more effective approach would be to pop over to google.com/nexus and buy a  replacement phone. Android is far from perfect, but it is the most open ecosystem on a smartphone right now, and if enough people switch, Apple will have stockholders to answer to!

This is a false equivalency. All religion is not young earth creationist Christian, outside of which context that answer isn't incompatible with the one you were looking for...


I think you may have had some poor experiences with religion and I'm very sorry for that. I'm not a member of any organized religion, but I have many friends who are, and I refuse to judge them on the basis of what someone else does.

While, in general, it's true that we apply the laws  disproportionately to those who are not in power, that's not what's going on here.
If you look at the specifics of both cases, they're very different. In the case of HSBC, there's lots of circumstantial evidence of winking and nodding to the cartels. It's a matter of, "of course you knew, and of course that's why you 'forgot' to implement laundering controls." It's easy to prove that they failed to implement those controls, but intent is always very tricky. The case would have cost a ton of money to prosecute, taken years, and in the end might have resulted in trivial fines and no jail time. The  settlement was probably the right choice, bad PR though it may be.
In the case of the BitInstant CEO, the prospects are very different. He and his partner are alleged to have directly advertised their currency exchange services on the Silk Road site, a site which clearly offered illegal goods and services for Bitcoin. Proving intent in this case is essentially a slam dunk, so why on earth would the  government not pursue those charges?
I love cryptocurrency and its potential to effect real change in world finance, but it's not a magic wand that makes illegal activities consequence free. I want to change the drug laws in the US because they're stupid and ineffective, but as long as they're the law of the land, those who flagrantly violate them and even throw up ads for money services on drug selling sites are going to jail.

I didn't think there was an argument put forward...


One can and I do. Religion is a many-thousand-year old institution which has been as broken and hurtful at times as any other human institution, but to claim that it has no merit because of that would disclaim all human endeavour.

Jesus is generally regarded by Jews as a teacher of some interesting principles, many of which were taught by other teachers at the same time and have wandered into the Jewish Talmud. His claims with respect to being the messiah are generally viewed as unoriginal (he was far from the only one to make such claims in that period) and more or less uninteresting, but his teaching is part of a more general Jewish movement which was a sea change in the religion, leading up to the radical changes that happened during the diaspora. The origins, in terms of outlook on ancient Judaism, by both modern Judaism and Christianity is not so very different.
