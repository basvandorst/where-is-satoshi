Do you have evidence 90% sold? It seems more likely to me that 90% haven't even touched their BCH and a minority sold.

It's Jeff Garzik's fork, supports Segwit2x
@_date: 2017-09-07 08:30:29
Why is a block size increase the mechanism that BCH and Segwit2x use to increase transaction throughput, rather than halving the time between blocks (10 minutes to 5 minutes)? What is the trade-off between fewer larger blocks vs more smaller blocks?
I ask because the increased block rate caused by the lower difficulty from BCH seemed to help clear bitcoin's mempool. Why not target a faster rate by design?

Bitcoin transactions out can take 15-60 minutes to hit the Blockchain too.
During the bubble this could take weeks, but it got a lot better in the past two months.

I'm a fan of purchasing electronics and accessories on Bitcoinin. Right now they have the 2013 Nexus 7, the latest iPod shuffle, Raspberry Pi Model B, and other little gadgets you might consider if you're part of the Bitcoin nouveau riche.

Well, you're only considering the financial cost. At the time, the moon landing had significant political repercussions in that it demonstrated the accuracy, reliability and ambitious nature of American rocketry.
This had to be done for political and military reasons at the time. Money was going to be spent demonstrating this point to the Soviet Union. With the Apollo program, the government chose to do this in a civilian and scientific context, rather than only testing weapons in an aggressive militaristic fashion. NASA's budget was enormous at the time-- I think 4 or 5% of the federal budget in some years. It was a substantial cost, but the benefits of the program were enormous and it was a spectacular success.
The threat of the time was a nuclear holocaust. The deterrence policy was Mutual Assured Destruction. The moon landing transformed this mood of annihilation at any moment into one of scientific optimism. It gave the USSR and the United States a way to compete on the public stage without just stockpiling weapons, although they did that as well.
History could have gone many ways. In the end we did not go to war with the USSR. We averted the incredible economic cost of a nuclear war. My point is that looking purely at the monetary costs doesn't make sense in evaluating the actions of the United States. Most people would not trust corporations with nuclear weapons, although now we have SpaceX investing private resources into rocketry for civilian purposes. But SpaceX isn't facing an existential threat, it's not operating in the shadow of World War II.
I personally do pay thousands of dollars a year in taxes. Would I like hundreds or thousands of those dollars to go to large, ambitious scientific projects that move the needle of human achievement? Yes, I would.

Why should I ask those things? It's clearly the government's responsibility to take down drug marketplaces that flaunt the law and profit off of it. Perhaps the law is wrong, but it's not FBI's responsibility to determine whether the law is just. It was FBI's responsibility to take down that marketplace and they did it remarkably well, considering the many sophisticated technologies involved.
Landing on the moon was an awesome achievement, one of the greatest in all of human history. Are you really suggesting otherwise? NASA took an incredible risk and got everyone home safe. A corporation couldn't have possibly borne that kind of risk, and it wouldn't have had the enormous impact on the American mythos that it did if, say, IBM traced their logo in moondust.
Bitcoin isn't so revolutionary that it makes the moon landing insignificant in comparison. The US government has done extraordinary things in its history, both great and terrible.

They took down Silk Road, compromising a Tor hidden service and confiscating over 100k Bitcoin in one fell swoop.
Let's see the private sector do that.
Edit: How about putting a man on the moon? No other nation has done that, let alone the market.

The price is volatile partly because the exchanges have major issues.
Some people get lucky: they have money on a functional exchange during a crash and scoop up cheap coins from panicked sellers. But being in that position comes with the risk of money getting frozen or lost when the exchange goes down.

Here's a reference for the cost of the entire program, roughly $25.4 billion
The population was roughly ~200 million at the time, so the cost per capita would be around $125. It really doesn't seem that oppressive, and it's closest to the smallest number you considered.

But other organizations don't have the ability to monetize their debt in the same way, among many other crucial differences. The US has the ability to influence macroeconomics. It doesn't make sense to consider it a firm and look at it through the lens of microeconomics.
That's why qualitative metrics like inequality-adjusted HDI are used to evaluate the prosperity of nations.
