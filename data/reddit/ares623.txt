I think a good motive to do this kind of attack would be to make the currency worthless and cripple the people/entities who depend on it. In this case, is it possible to "roll back" the attack for those affected?

Roads and computers were built by centralized organizations (govt, corporations) with their own specific goals. I think there's some disconnect. 
The users of roads and computers didn't come together one day and decided they should build roads and computers themselves.
But maybe if Apple or Facebook or whatever were to start accepting Bitcoin (and only Bitcoin because too many choices would be confusing) to force adoption that might drive things forward.
