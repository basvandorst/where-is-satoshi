So the average raise is a factor of 12 per year, mainly due to the sharp prize increase in 2010/11. The most likely (median) prize increase per year is a factor of 3.3. Now we're on factor of 25 (comparing to dec 17 2016).

Ok here we go. The bitcoin price is a function of the transaction per given time period. The match is very solid apart from the known hype periods and offers a price base line. This base line was followed closely until december 18 and touched again briefly on january 9 after the chinese intervention. The price never wend more than about 10% below the base line since 2011. This baseline of the value of btc is exponential growng in time. Currently the price ($1060) is 17% above the base line. The base line will hit $1060 on may 5 this year. So if you buy now you will have a risk until may 5 you feel sorry, after that profit changes are pretty solid. The base line hits $1750 on december 31. A hype will push the price even higher. This is according to my own analysis. For what it's worth. Looks like it will only fail when something bad hits btc that exceeds the serious problems that were faced since 2011.

Don't forget to use coins and buy stuff as that resembles the true value in the long run.

This is surely true. I even tend to see it as a strong feature in the long run. Like a way of evolution.

Is this the reason for the recent drop in bitcoin transactions?

The difference is the scaling. Here the trendline (in Excel) is calculated while both parameters were displayed on a logaritmic scale. The lineair relationship becomes stronger.

How does it compare to other big US cities?

Creepy, can't believe this actually going to happen. More reasons to go for bitcoin.

Today, a month and a bit after the split I made these graphs. Thanks to bitinfocharts.com for providing the data. On the X-axis wallet balances with 10 fold increments. On the Y-axis of the first plot the number of coins these wallet categories hold all together. In the second plot the # of BCC minus BTC per category. 
Apparently wallet holder of 1000 to 10000 and 100000 to 1 million bought BCC for BTC. The first group 370k and the second 730k. The category up to 1 million has 125k left. There is just one BTC address in this category and 3 BCC addresses. The sum of both coins overall differ less than 0.1%. With this pace they will run out of resources soon. I take it this is the largest fraction of BCC buyers. Don’t know about fiat and altcoins BCC buyers.
What do you think?

Mine were also stuck. Apparently the transaction can hang around in the mempool for about 72 hour max, then either it's picked up by a miner (in my case) or cancelled. Actually the coins never left your original wallet unless the transaction ends up in the blockchain. If it's cancelled they will show in the original wallet. Not sure if you need to refresh the blockchain in your wallet by then. It is pretty frustrating.
