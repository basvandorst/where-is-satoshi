*kind* of not true that it's fully browser-based because everyone is connecting via a proxy @  but still very cool :)

Chrome extension, I dig that... keep up the awesome work.

The proxy will always be required though, right? So still a point of centralization in my eyes... would be interesting to see a BIP that allows P2P connections to the network via WebRTC, similar to what they're doing with WebTorrent ( then desktop wallets could add support and we'd have nice browser&lt;&gt;desktop interconnectivity :)

Kind of premature to claim that something is going to "kill" the need for alts if it's whitepaper isn't yet written.

I think this is pretty conclusive, feel sorry for the poor guy. Newsweek have some correcting / apologizing to do.

"Let's add another layer on top of our already complex cryptocurrency in order to achieve what should be built-in functionality, just to confuse new users that little bit extra."
Sounds like a surefire way to build adoption! 
PS. I thought sidechains were going to "kill" altcoins...? *checks watch*

Bringing logic and reason to a Bitcoin fight? Brave.

Yep, except that no viable PoW alternative exists right now. Once it does, I'm certain the dev team will steer towards it. 
In the meantime, all cryptocurrency is in a bit of a pickle - just as lead Bitcoin devs themselves are saying.

Amir needs to realize that linking Bitcoin to radical fundamentalists, while sounding "hardcore" and cool on his behalf, is not going to turn out well for the mass adoption of digital currencies.

You're going to get downvoted for this, but I asked myself the same question as I reached the end of the article. Could have instilled a lot more confidence through analysis before arriving at that conclusion.

Relationship with ChangeTip is that I scraped some of their PubNub data for my initial investigation, but it wasn't complete - so rather than me going around sharing incorrect insights, they felt comfortable sharing a database dump with me for the big day in question (11/6). They've assured me that public stats are something on their roadmap, but they're busy with other priorities right now. 
I've known Nick and the team for quite a while, so they were confident I wouldn't breach their trust and share the more granular data (which contains some personally identifiable information, obviously).
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:31:19
is next on my radar for looking at the data... it's hard because I have no reliable way of getting a complete feed from Reddit + Twitch where they're active. I hear they'll be making some data public though, so fingers crossed.

There's nothing wrong with taking an experiment seriously... that being said, Bitcoin and all current-gen cryptocurrencies face some challenges. I recommend you check out / listen to:

There is also code referencing product reviews and the marketplace across the rest of the codebase. Just do a source on the Github repo for "product" or "atom" and you'll see what I'm talking about. Here's an example, "market.cpp" - 
Several folks involved since very early on have also confirmed that Satoshi was sketching these ideas up.

Yep, although it would probably be a decent haul for attackers if all existing Deposit addresses were compromised. No signs of a hot or cold wallet attack right now.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:43:49
[Reverse IP lookup resolving to mail.bitstamp.com]( + Google Mail letting that through + the fact they somehow had the Bitstamp customer list makes this seem legit.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:56:14
My gut feeling is that the DB they were storing existing Deposit addresses in (incl. private keys) was in some way compromised... depending on how they were generating the addresses, it could have alternatively been a RNG attack, similar to what Blockchain.info were recently hit with.

*[Just my theory below, take it or leave it]*
I've seen this in the past with big hot wallet hacks, including Dogevault when the same sort of attack happened. 
When you have these massive wallets with tons and tons of tiny inputs, the input selection loop in bitcoind (Bitcoin Core) hangs and can completely crash the machine when you send a large enough amount in one go... so what you usually see when hackers gain access to a hot wallet is a starting large amount and then a gradual decline in the amount of coins they can get out without crashing the daemon.
From the incoming transactions on that address, my guess is that several hot wallets (on different machines) were in fact compromised and then the hackers had to do the transactions out in gradually declining chunks (start with a few thousand BTC, half that for next tx, and so on). 
In the case of Dogevault, this daemon inefficiency actually saved nearly 40-50% of the coins from being stolen because people were directly mining into their addresses with a heap of tiny amounts. We ended up having to construct the raw transactions and send them to the network itself from the salvaged wallet.dat as the reference implementation would simply hang whenever we tried to send to an address. 
Those small amounts you're seeing floating into the hacker's address are probably them siphening out smaller and smaller inputs while trying not to crash bitcoind :)
