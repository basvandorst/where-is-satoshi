They want to reenter the legal US market and they don't want issues with other jurisdictions. Stars recently ended service to a number of grey market countries for those reasons.

I'm looking forward to trying this out.

I agree. There was no money at risk so nothing to refund.


Funny how OP doesn't tell us the bug was that the bet was never deducted from his balance and thus never at risk. He implies that the bug is one where he bets 20BTC and should have won the bet but instead he lost the bet the site takes his bet.
Here's is what I suspect happened:
OP finds a bug. He places a large wager knowing he is freerolling. He then threatens the reputation of the site (in the US I believe this would qualify as blackmail) by going public unless they pay him a premium fee for his bug detection and pain and suffering from "the way they spoke to him". 
Even if I'm wrong and the OP really thought the 20BTC bet was at risk it doesn't change anything. There was never any BTC at risk.

This post is a great example of the lack of a basic understanding of math.  I took a large position in bitcoin around $100 figuring it had 5-10% chance of great success.  If my guess is accurate, likely the best investment if my life.

You told everyone you knew about bit coins and literally 50% wanted to physically assault you?
You need better friends.  Or better communication skills.
