Hm now I get it, seems like I'm not in the current position to start with btc mining, but thanks for all the info!

Now if I get multiple gpu's will I just add their hash rate together then put it in?

I'm also on my phone, I know how it feels. But is btc mining still profitable, or will I need strokes of luck and expensive machines to do so? Also thanks!

So as time goes on, the btc will be worth more, but I'll get less of it. So I should expect to make less in the future?

Hm so bitcoin mining has more variables then I expected, seems like I would have to do this if I had spare cash and willing to take the risk for it.

I do plan to do it for fun, just making a profit can be a nice addition to it as well. I also plan to do pool mining.

Ah alright thanks for the help!

.50 in one day? Is that a typical expectation? Or is it uncommon to do pool mining for a day and get that? 
@_date: 2012-03-11 16:11:47
So im guessing that isn't a lot at all?

So get guiminer, and go to bitcointak to find pools to join in to mine? Would it be difficult to find a pool, or is it fairly easy?

Well i have a ATI radeon 3600 HD series, so no luck there? The BTCguild, so i join in and share blocks with other people and mine them in a pool? Would that be difficult to setup?
