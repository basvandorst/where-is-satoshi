There is another subtle parallel if you take into account the conspiracy theory that JP Morgan sunk the Titanic (or the identical ship Olympia) as a necessary gambit to save an insolvent company and the ship just so happened to contain the 3 main elites who opposed the federal reserve. Idk I saw some documentary on it. But yeah ... maybe .. uh .. just maybe JP morgan was involved in goxing up bitcoin ... too
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:35:19
same here. The feeling isn't new either. I made and account and sent 4 bitcoin to Bitcoin-24 the night before they got shut down. and I never used MTGOX until a month ago, when I decided to move my BTC-e funds to it because I got nervous about russia investigating them and because of my previous experience losing money on an exchange. Altogether I put up $3000 as an investment and ended up with about 20 bitcoins before GOX went down. Those coins were basically my future because I am poor and don't really want to live most days. But for some reason I'm feeling okay now and sort of unfazed. I just have this feeling like I'll make it all back. It's a huge blow but I'm confident in my abilities. Shit like this just makes me stronger.

I really like Campbx. they continue to try to make it easy to buy bitcoin but keep getting fucked over. I used to use dwolla with them and it was totally THEE way to go. Too bad that went south, and now this. It's quite a conundrum buying bitcoin with USD.

you guys are looking at it wrong. the utility of bitcoin should be able to adapt to everyone's preference. If someone wants to use some easy system with minimal security with bitcoin, they should be able to.  do what you want with your money, they will with theirs.

There are many of us still trying to track down and get word from the owner of bitcoin-24. I have the worst luck. i made an account and put some of my btc on that website the night before it got shut down. and recently, about a month ago, i moved all my btc into MTGOX because I thought it'd be safer there than BTC-e. I have no idea why I thought that.  
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:14:58

I don't understand how anyone informed could see the current monetary system as anything better than a necessary evil.

you guys are acting immature. There is no reason why the leak has to be linked from this site. You can find it elsewhere if you want to. That's the magic of the internet. there is no centralized source so the censorship from this site is meaningless. It's like being mad that you aren't entitled to deal drugs in someone's restaurant. They aren't censoring the spreading of facts about the leak, if they were, then you would have an argument.

the ironic thing is that a month before GOX shut down, I transferred all my funds from BTC-e to MTGOX because I was spooked about the exchange and heard rumblings of it being investigated. I had already lost 4 bitcoin from when Bitcoin-24 went down (which I signed up and transfered there the night before they shut down), and I was still skeptical. I transferred to gox because first of all I had a verified account that I never used and because I for some reason figured GOX was such a big deal (people always name the price, etc) and fiat withdrawals and DDOS attacks are trivial and meaningless to me. Also because I am a day trader and GOX is good for that. I of course lost all my bitcoin in this ordeal. I know I should have kept some in storage but as a trader, you need a lot to make a lot. So I suppose I've learned a lesson here or there. I should have investigated GOX more before trusting them. This may sound wrong and offensive, but for example if I knew that Karpeles was a rotund immature and asocial frenchman I wouldn't have used the site. I thought they were japanese and honestly japanese people wouldn't have fucked up. 
and btw there was no big obvious risk with GOX. This situation is literally bigger than anyone could have imagined. Imagine someone saying in the trollbox "karpeles lost 850,000 bitcoin". that is typical absurd sounding trollbox FUD and not even the most scorned Karpeles haters would think he was capable of something so FUBAR. We gotta hand it to him, he really took it to the next level. And god damn it his hair-do has never looked better.

@_date: 2014-02-10 23:02:00
How about instead of trying to sweep things under the rug in order to defend bitcoin's image we come to terms with the fact that bitcoin does have problems related to consumer protection. The fact that anyone can create an exchange and then steal millions of dollars worth of bitcoin and get away with it is a problem. And don't tell me 'all the warning signs were there' and 'you should have saw this coming'. it's bullshit. If I, someone who's not all that saavy but at least checks bitcoin news daily and trades daily has made the stupid mistake of trusting the wrong company, what the hell are regular people going to do? I've lost bitcoin on bitcoin-24 shutting down, and now the rest of my holdings are in jeopardy with GOX. This is unacceptable and frankly: it sucks. It makes dealing with a bank look fantastic. Is having the feeling to be constantly vigilant and in fear the bitcoin experience? Because that's what it's been like for me. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:15:22
I would not doubt that Karpeles is getting out of the bitcoin business entirely and handing off mtgox to someone else. That's why he quit the foundation. He's a tech businessman and will move on to shade 3d whatever that is. He's got his eyes on the future. We bitcoiners may hate him but a year from now when mtgox is successful exchange under new management it will look good on his resume that he was once the CEO. This is the smartest move for him

"Am I a dick for saying this?"
Yes. 
 Many semi-suicidal people have nothing to lose. So to say that they put more than they can afford to lose is pointless. It's not even about the bitcoin they lost. It's the way life feels overbearing and shit. Nobody who puts a ton of money in something as a risk because their life sucks actually care about the money they lost. What they lost is hope that their life can get better. Second of all, the amount of money has no bearing either. People may put a relatively small amount of money into bitcoin that they can obviously afford to lose (since it's just sitting in storage.. fucking duh) and still want to kill themselves for losing it. Why? isn't it obvious? Bitcoin has skyrocketed in price. If you got in at 50$, you will pretty much never again be able to own as many bitcoins as you did. The idea of investing in bitcoin in order to make their dreams happen or start a business may appear to be lost for the person who feels stuck at a low paying shit job that is deteriorating their health.

you're all wrong. all of income tax goes to the federal reserve. The money to pay for govt is written with a blank check from an account with nothing in it. your taxes don't go towards anything. The govt literally doesn't even need income tax except to pay off debt and interest. but guess what the debt will never end and always increase each cycle, so it will never be paid off (it's designed this way). So what does that mean? It means the govt may as well just print the money and not take any tax. What's the difference? Our taxes literally only enrich the banking cartel. Fuck em. THEY DEVISED THIS SYSTEM. Let them pay for this government. it's the least they can do. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:14:23
that's unbelievable. not only are they ignorant of bitcoin but also of what a Ponzi scheme is. what they are referring to is a 'bubble', which is just a natural part of financial markets. for example bitcoin at 30$ was a bubble, it corrected, and now it's at $370, which is a correction of the bubble at 1200. It's all relative. if you look at a 5 minute chart, you will see the shape of bubbles as you would on a 1 day chart, like a fractal.

I think we can agree that the bitcoin community has all these symptoms of groupthink. But, not many groups can admit that the group has groupthink and is detrimental.

There is a forum called bitcoin-24 victims which you can google. Some of is are even trying to sue them. And yeah I lost the rest of my coins on GOX.

I wouldn't assume that people expect to get RICH. People need a boost. Many people have done this to pay off their college loans, or to buy a Canon Mk II so they can make movies, or perhaps spend it on their children's private school or college, or to buy the studio or music equipment, maybe start a small business. That's the type of thing people lost. Maybe that seems weird to want to self-destruct because of something seemingly insignificant, but these people already want to do that anyway because of the system they feel they are stuck in. Their hope of something new has been taken from them. That's a worse feeling than having no hope of change at all. I'm not saying that these suicidal people aren't troubled, because they are and they either need help or need to push themselves and not let this get them down. My advice to them would be to take this as a lesson to strategize more completely. Diversify your means. But I'm not going to say they are all greedy bastards who shouldn't put more than they can afford to lose. I defend people who take risks. Taking risks is living and is necessary for doing anything extraordinary. But keep your expectations in check. I would say "If you want to realize your dreams, demand much of yourself and expect little of others". Be safe instead of sorry.

Definition: A business, also known as an enterprise or a firm, is an organization involved in the trade of goods, services, or both to consumers.
If you have no customers you aren't a business, you're just an organization.

the problem with gold is that it is mostly inconceivable for anyone who isn't rich. I can afford maybe 2 little tiny gold coins. You can't really chop gold up anymore than that. and since gold is projected to at least double in the next 10 years it makes it even worse. and if gold goes down making it easier to buy, then it clearly shows it isn't the store of value everyone says it is. I have, however, bought 100 oz of silver (Schiff had a little to do with the decision --and I've lost 1600$ so far because of it) which at least feels good because it's a nice supply of something.

yeah that's always what sucks too is that it doesn't matter if you go over by 1$ you always get hit with a 30$ fee. I used to overdraft alot. honestly, it's sort of a nice feature if you really need the money but that's what having a credit card is for. 
The funny thing is that by putting your money in the bank you are lending the bank money, but they apparently have such a problem lending you money? i can understand more if the fee was proportional to the amount you went over by but they wouldn't make much profit that way. i usually only went over by a few bucks because i was just scraping by and usually my balance wouldn't update in real time so i couldn't tell how much I had

pump and dump implies that the currency reaches lows that it never recovers from and is abandoned. btc and most altcoins are not like this, even if we do call manipulated market movements pump n dumps, it typically doesn't debase the value of the coin and sometimes even increases its value. badholders of btc will always break even but the same can't be said for every alt-coin

This is a major problem especially since bitcoins can no longer be mined by the commoner, i fear areas in the "third world" because of bitcoin's reliance on tech to be once again holding bitcoin extremely disproportionately compared to more developed areas of the world. bitcoin could change entire communities instead of being some 85,000/yr IT guy's luxury fund. the number one priority for bitcoin in my opinion is making it as easy to buy with fiat as possible. Until I can turn my paycheck into bitcoin nearly instantly there will be no incentive to spend bitcoin. If bitcoin is hard to get, people are going to hoard it; it's just common sense.
