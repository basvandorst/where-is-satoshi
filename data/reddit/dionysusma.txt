Maybe one person did influence the price to some extent, but I'm pretty sure most people heard about bitcoin for the first time after silk road was shut down and every news outlet was talking about it.

It was 25c because the coins were on the exchange's address and they make a transaction with tens of recipients at a time so the fee is split between all of you. the transaction would be something [like this]( and you're one of the guys on the right.

Why don't they all support it? What's the extra thing they have to do to be able to send to bench32 addresses?

Poloniex does not support sending to bc1 addresses.
EDIT: does NOT*
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:25:35
What about addresses that start with bc1 ?

I'm new to bitcoin. I thought Bcash was created because the majority of miners wanted to keep the block size limited to 1Mb for Bitcoin. What does Segwit have to do with higher block sizes?

And what is the difference between dividing the transaction sizes by 4 and increasing the block size by 4x?

They said 3% of the 10%

A more correct way to look at it is if 10% of the world wanted to own $1000 worth of bitcoin on average then the value of a bitcoin would be $33,333.($700B/21 million coins)
Now of course, when big companies and institutions, and governments start getting involved, each one will want hundreds of millions worth of bitcoin, which would drive the $1000 to way more than that.
Edit: 33,333 not 3,333
