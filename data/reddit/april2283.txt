Hey buddy, love being helpful. Here are some insights for you. 
**Limit:** 
I have a 15k/weekly and it did not take more than a few weeks to get that through "normal" usage on the account. It went up in increments. Going through all the verification steps along with buying a couple hundred bucks in coins each week was all it took. 
**Debit/Credit Cards:** 
I have never used a debit/credit card to purchase, only my bank account. Not sure if you are asking if using your card will increase your rate faster, but I do not believe so. 
**Processing time:**
Whatever the price is that you see of the time of your transaction is the price you will pay. That would really suck if there was 2-3 days of possible price slippage!
**Buy Low / Sell High**
Not giving financial or advice here because I do not know y our personal situation or experience, but IMO the best strategy is to buy and hold for the long term. If that's your strategy then Coinbase is a good option. However, if you are looking to trade... 
**Trading:** 
Look into the exchanges  and  Depending on how deep you plan to go  could be useful as well. Again, not giving you advice... but there are some smaller coins that have more volatility and could lead to higher gains, consider a diversified portfolio, companies like  can be useful for long-term diversified buy and hold portfolios.  
Also do your research on the exchanges and do NOT keep your digital assets on the exchange. Look into some cold storage options and take your assets off the exchanges if you are not going to be actively trading them.
