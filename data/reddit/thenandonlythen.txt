From the Artie Lange wikipedia:


I get that he has issues.  But that's one of the most messed-up suicide attempts I've ever heard of.  Nine times.  In the abdomen.  There are ghosts of nearly captured Japanese officers grimacing and saying, "What the fuck, man."

Pretty sure nothing ever came of those charges and I don't think anything ever will, especially with all this corruption from the agents.  Doesn't even matter, Ross is still going to rot for the rest of his life on the basis of that completely fucked "investigation."

Coinbase can eat a dick. After about a dozen sells for a couple thousand each with no buys (I got in early, sadly all I put into "savings" is 2.5btc but I still made a nice little bit) I got an email telling me I needed to verify to them where I was getting my BTC from.  I used a mixer explicitly to prevent this from happening, and this was shortly after MtGox imploded.  I would no longer be able to sell but I could still let them hold onto my bitcoin they their wallet service! I laughed, told them to fuck off and close my account.  Localbitcoins was so much better, I should have been doing that all along anyway when I wanted to sell.

I can get you that info when bitcoin-qt comes up, it's currently in the middle of a rescan to verify my local blockchain thanks to what I describe next. 
Manually pushing the transaction gave me a "Could not find all input transactions, you might have referenced some input transactions that are not in network." error.  Not sure what to make of this new development, all the coins I had certainly came from somewhere and were definitely in network.  At least at one point.

Now trying to push a raw transaction I'm getting "could not find all input transactions" -- apparently some of that 3 coins was all in my imagination.  The plot thickens!

In high school it was FAR easier to score weed than alcohol.  Both were possible, the former took at most a couple hours while the latter was often a days-long process to make sure we had supplies for the weekend.
