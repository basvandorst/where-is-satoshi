You gave up, could of hustled and bought back in after the first huge dip and bought along at $200.   Make a cool $300k, so fucking what?
Don't beat yourself up over it. That was past you. Present you needs to look out for future you. BTC is at a good price point, buy now. $50 a week, who gives a shit. Get an extra shift or two at a diner or bar on top of your current job. Make some moves kid. 
I promise whatever epic notions of a life you could of had are a fantasy. We only paint a more positive alternate reality, never a realistic or negative one. 
Taxes? You would of had to pay taxes when you sold. Would you of had the wherewithal to set aside money for taxes? You could of messed that up and been hit with penalties to the tune of 50% of your gains.
Maybe that sudden payday would of gone to your head. Maybe you would have blown most of it on drugs and people who would of latched on to you and sucked you dry. 
You could of been high on coke and wrecked your lambo killing someone and ending up in jail for the rest of your days. 
Your future hasn't been written yet, write a good one.

Whenever I generate a new address from my Trezor, it stars with a 3. Does that mean these are SegWit addresses?
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:22:51
Interesting, thanks

Real estate title transfers are a big one.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:30:24
How can I operate one?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:05:17
Transactions were very cheap and pretty quick end of November. I'm of the opinion that miners are spamming the network to attack BTC and make BCH more attractive.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:27
Can't move my BCash into Coinbase from my Blockchain wallet. Transaction is just not responding 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:37:10
Maybe, some may be waiting for the new tax year before harvesting some profit.

You can't have scaling problems without scale
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:08:49
100k or bust
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:06
stuck at $8400, could have suspended trading? GDAX is down, purchasing Bitcoin Cash through Coinbase is currently suspended, my transaction from my wallet to Coinbase is frozen
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:25:56
Yea, mine took about 7 business days to verify. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:12
No, whatever you held on August 1 in Bitcoin you have in Bitcoin Cash. What wallet do you use?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:56
Love Gemini
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:51:13
Gemini, no app though
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:52:33
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:30:41
That was the point! Dump it now!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:09
Worth it. Daily withdrawal limit of 100k. Can purchase $500/day worth of Bitcoin immediately while your bank transfer is pending.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:21:35
Gemini has daily withdrawal limit of 100k, not sure what the bank wire limit is. Transactions are high right now but maybe transfer BTC to Gemini and sell there.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:26:28
It acts as an insurance policy. If I agree to sell you 50 containers of consumer electronics at 50 BTC for example, you take delivery in 30 days and pay me on delivery. I want to make sure if value of BTC falls, I won't lose money on this deal. So I purchase a futures contract which will pay me if BTC falls in value. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:30:02
Damn, I didn't get that. They just wanted photo id. Maybe you have higher account limits.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:17:06
Verification for Gemini is just a photo id, nothing crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:40:03
It's early days. You didn't expect a high quality movie to download over 56k modem. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:36
Damn, wish I kept all my BTC on Coinbase this whole time instead of cold storage
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:29:51
Hahahaha first time I've laughed out loud like that this week. Thank you for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:41:36
Took me 5 business days back in April. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:54:25
You can still make 15%-20% returns today. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:36:01
What did you study in college? Time to start looking for a new job, connections help but that isn't the end all be all to finding a job. It's also time to start fostering connections.
You know why people hire people they know? It becomes expensive and time consuming as fuck when you hire somebody and need to fire them because they turn out to be dead weight/have poor hygiene/are sexist/ are racist/steal etc. You don't have to be somebody's nephew, try becoming an acquaintance with various people in the industry you want to enter. Attend trade shows or seminars, directly email company's you really admire (small and large) about work opportunities. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:18:22
Cool, good for you. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:54:10
Move to Gemini
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:18:33
Adding Dogecoin now?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:30:28
Panic buying atm
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:27:47
I'm pretty sure they also hold a lot of BTC
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:36:14
 I need to see this on video
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:39:53
Needs Segwit
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:50:36
People sending money abroad, instead of a 5% fee to Western Union or a $50 charge from your bank that takes days to clear, you can use crypto for a fee of less than 0.1% and an instant transaction. 
Now calculate cross border trade. It takes days for bank wires to clear, meanwhile product has to be shipped on credit or is pre paid or waits at a warehouse until bank transfer clears.

Can you apply for a 0% credit card? Some dental offices have 0% interest payment plans.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:21:56
BUY BUY BUY
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:05:56
I'd love another case study to cite...
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:12:20
Fees are way down now
