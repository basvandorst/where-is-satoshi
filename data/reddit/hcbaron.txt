But I'm not selling when I'm using bitcoin to buy, let's say, a laptop online. I'm using it as currency. Isn't it treated as a cash transaction then?

I'm an accountant, so I don't understand this. A simple internal control measure would be to not accept stolen bitcoins if it is known that they've been stolen.

So don't accept! It would basically render the stolen bitcoin worthless.

Ah I see. The report I read didn't mention it was the entire account. Has it always been the entire account in past heists? Has it ever been just partial. More importantly I am wondering if it is always accurately traceable who's bitcoins got stolen. Forgive me, I know very little about bitcoin.

You mean FIFO vs LIFO?

So when the thief tries to use those bitcoins in a future transaction, will the receiving party recognize that it's coming from the thief's account?

I still don't get it, if there is a public ledger that is based on peer verification, then why doesn't the community collectively agree that the valid history stops at the time a bitcoin is stolen. It would render the stolen bitcoins worthless, and would simultaneously increase the value of the remaining valid bitcoins. It would eliminate incentive to steal in the first place.

Oh, was it the entire wallet?

So, is bitcoin an currency or a security? Im still confused.

Independent, leaning liberal.
