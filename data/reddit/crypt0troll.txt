Man I know the koreans paying 30% premium for Bitcoins but damn they allowed to sell some once in awhile too. This official could just be doing normal buying and selling just like 1/3 of the SK's. Pretty sure it's normal for officials to own crypto over there. Why is this even news.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:13:57
I also like bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-14 08:27:13
My last troll comment on this guy got me downvoted 30 times but It won’t stop me. This guy CZ is one of the biggest shillers in the game. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 16:00:48
Where are you seeing that it handles 40% crypto markets? Kraken ain’t handling nowhere near 40%
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:21:47
By the way crypto has been going when bakkt goes live the market will probably tank further

Dudes hating on the report didn’t read it. It’s about making you aware where you are putting your money and the risks involved. Dudes acting like exchange hacks ain’t a common thing around here. Please...
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:04:08
Yes. Kraken probably has about 40% market volume for Euro/btc. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:29:09
He ain’t lying 
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:00:38
You are looking at trading volume for euro’s only. Coinmarketcap.com will show you all the trading pair volumes

When you work for a startup that got funded  millions in an ICO I can imagine all the perks

The etf is not for you. It’s for people that aren’t willing to go to the efforts to secure their own bitcoins. An etf Lowers the complexity for many folks in owning bitcoin. Stop hating 
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:37:40
To all the people whining about the people whining about the price of bitcoin. Stop it. This is cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 07:20:58
TLDR: a nobody says bitcoin etf “not far away”

This might be a shock to you but bitcoin at $5k or $50k doesn’t mean anything to the underlying technology. Walk street can’t mess with that.

Go on bitfinex reddit and you will see stories of people being notified their accounts will be shut down in 14 days. This only happens after they request for a fiat withdrawal. These guys are fine with you trading and paying them fees but once you want to get out some fiat boom see you later nice knowing you. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:24:33
Free money I ain't complaining.

No watermark ok but would be easy to check users names then bring up details of this person in Binance systems. Then check if hacked kyc photo is same as Binance kyc photo. Easy.

Check your own ethereum wallet and see what random airdropped coins you have there that you didn’t know about before you give shit to people not knowing about b2x

@_date: 2019-01-29 15:39:11
Kraken sells usdt. Why don’t you just buy that and sit on it on a wallet outside of the exchange for the time being. Interested to hear what kraken has to say about your situation.
