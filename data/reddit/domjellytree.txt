Aren't downvotes meant for comments which do not contribute to discussion? Not for something you personally disagree with? Also, your comment contributes nothing to discussion.

Blockchain technology is a huge step for all of man kind, not a way to undermine all authority. Any authority capable of rubbing 2 brain cells together will learn to adapt, innovate, and utilise this new tech to the best of its potential

It’s a way for people to transact money safely, cheaply, and anonymously, and store wealth without a third party ever getting involved
@_date: 2019-04-14 12:25:29
What about my comment implies that I was freaking out? Haha! I can’t wait until that time! Just predicting it might go down a bit first
@_date: 2019-04-14 12:39:04
Ah yeah I can see how you look at it that way. How do you know there are big players in the game though? And does this necessarily mean there aren’t more big players still trying to keep it down in the longer term?
@_date: 2019-04-14 10:20:15
I don't feel very inspired by the last couple of weeks. Think there hasn't been anywhere near the bull volume we need to change the long term trend and we are going down before a true reversal
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:57:51
Mmm I think you're right there. I sold a tiny bit in anticipation of it dropping a bit further over the next 12-24 hours, we'll see what happens 
EDIT: Regardless, great to see it higher than it was before last week's dip.
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:27:21
We can even call the people who panic sell when it drops and fomo buy when it goes up the dodos if you want 
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:06:46
Yep I think that was the whale dump and now bulls pushed it up again. I think soon bulls bears whales will all join together in buying soon to push past the high we saw yesterday
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:04:38
Just then. About to be a bit of a run up to sunday sell off (obviously pure guess that could be totally wrong)
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:54:27
Smart contracts aiding the privacy and security of bitcoin makes me orgasm 
@_date: 2018-03-07 01:50:01
Jump on the pattern of the whales, it's great fun to keep increasing your stash
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:10:41
Nah that's wrong. It facilitates decentralised currency which is exceptionally valuable
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:45:14
His point is that bitcoin has value in its own right and doesn’t need to be compared to fiat to have value haha
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:17:40
Came a bit later than that but I’m pretty happy with how close I got!
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:48:38
Nothing guaranteed but from my research of money and bitcoin, it seems pretty likely in my eyes 
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:21:32
Mt gox trustee dumping huge volumes at a time turned the bull market bearish. With every sell off the market (to some extent) absorbed it and recovered 
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:09:11
Ah if you're more a bull than a bear then it really doesn't matter when you get in. The difference won't matter when it reaches a new ATH later this year 
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:02:22
Honestly just cut the winnings you could have had and just buy now. Won't matter so much in a year when it could be 40-50,000
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:22:49
You don’t understand the technology if you don’t think it has a function in the future 
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:44:29
But they can't dump forever. As u/spitgriffin has already pointed out, it's redistributing bitcoin which will lead to far less volatility 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:56:11
Pump some good old fashioned fomo into the veins of the people bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:05:28
Price hike coming
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:08:24
They're so pro crypto they'll probably start up 2 more exchanges in addition to the legislation 
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:00:41
Just buy now there's a decent chance that was a bottom of some sorts
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:13:12
You're tunnel visioning on what his words literally mean instead understanding the semantics of it. He is saying 1 bitcoin will have purchasing power in the future based on blockchain technology 
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:24:08
Exactly so his sarcasm is appropriate to respond to "no way after 100% increase from 6k"
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:01:40
Yeah I think so too. Just sold a little then
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:41:28
Very happy with my prediction in the last price discussion thread ;). Will be ready to sell on sunday 
@_date: 2018-03-04 07:01:28
Are we seeing a sunday sell off right now?
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:18:01
I think it's already happened
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:05:24
Here we go, look for a bit of a spike in about 2 hours then an upwards trend for about 3 days
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:15:27
Can't wait to sell a bit once we see a dip and then buy back in 
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:48:46
Bull is if you think the market has long term value and you would buy and hold.
Bear is if you think the market will have many ups and downs and you buy low and sell high to make profit. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:45:59
haha mate don't be like that! Also, I think you might be projecting a fair bit here with the own benefit thing
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:57:38
Well if that’s what you want to do go for it! I will admit, I have a sneaking suspicion a lot of people also support BTC for the greater good. No idea where I got that idea from
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:24:48
Yeah I'm not sure we'll go that low anymore 
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:20:05
Good luck dude, it's good to hear this head start has got you motivated
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:34:24
Probably. What's your point 
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:56:30
I'm trying to say that we've been bearish for so long, that I thought we would need a lower low than the one we just had to trigger a switch. I'm very inexperienced with TA though so this is just more a gut feel 
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:30:00
Me neither. My gut feel is clowns and we will see one more low. Will have to wait and see 
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:31:14
No you're a fool!
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:57:48
Hmm when will it pull back a touch, always on the lookout to sell and buy back in 
@_date: 2018-07-31 08:52:29
Is this looking bearish to anyone else?
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:26:51
Everyone would be wise to remember the 5 week run we had from april to may! No idea if this is a true return to a bull market, but I was expecting it to get to a lower low before ALL the bulls got on. I'm still waiting in the wings. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 10:35:03
It really, really depends on how the next bull run plays out. All I know is, yes, planning to cash out a decent amount at some point so I can reinvest again
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:14:21
Or wake up and take profits as well
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:42:25
I think a lot of people are still bearish. Sub 3k is pretty extreme though
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:49:27
Both, sir 
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:11:29
Good explanation. To add onto it for clarity, at some point, all 21 million bitcoin will be mined and the only reward to be shared will be transaction fees for on chain transactions. This will drop the number of miners drastically as the rewards for mining will have dropped drastically and a "sweet spot" of no. of miners vs rewards will be reached. 
Someone with more knowledge on the matter please correct me if I'm wrong there
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:16:48
I have no experience in the field but I reckon if you do that you could not be faulted and even if they forcibly correct you, you won't be liable for any kind of penalty.
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:08:18
BUY MAN BUY
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:19:54
Exactly the same for me. Thinking there's a decent chance there will be a pullback of sorts and waiting for it to re up
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:11:11
Bitcoin is very much deflationary. No arguments possible. Don't understand your contrast between inflation and price inflation? What's the difference? Doesn't make sense to me
