Guessing they'll go for about what a Bitcoin is worth?  OR is there something about the system that will value them higher or lower?

This train has left the station... now you'd be playing an unregulated "commodity" that is driven by rumor/news.
Suggest you get some, try using it and gain an understanding about how it works and doesn't work before investing any significant amount in it.

Regulation in the legal sense as applied to "investments."  SEC/FTC in the US doesn't see it as anything they'd get involved with, AFAIK.  They seem to have a "wait and see" stance.
From the BC FAQ:
Legal status and regulation
Main article: Legality of bitcoin by country
The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. While some countries have explicitly allowed its use and trade, others have banned or severely restricted it. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoins differently. Regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin likely extend to similar cryptocurrency systems.
In April 2013, Steven Strauss, a Harvard public policy professor, suggested that governments could outlaw bitcoin,[246] and this possibility was mentioned again by a bitcoin investment vehicle in a July 2013, report to a regulator.[228] However, the vast majority of nations have not done so as of 2014. It is illegal in: Bangladesh,[247] Bolivia,[248] Ecuador,[249] Russia,[250] and Vietnam.[251]
