Will the market correct itself? I wanted to increase my holdings in bitcoin and recently invested a little in ether, Monero and litecoin. I've lost some bitcoin as a result. 
Do you guys think that their prices will recover soon?

I agree. I want to stick to bitcoin and bitcoin alone. However, in the short term some extra BTC would be nice.

I'm obviously a firm believer of btc over any altcoin. I like eth because it's underlying tech is great. However what about Japan's biggest bank partnering up with ripple?
