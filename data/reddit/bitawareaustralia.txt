I'm afraid you are using fiat at every step of the way, except paying additional fees at some stages, and you think you're free of government currency.
And then you call everyone else "dumb".
Sorry man, but you're using Bitcoin as a means of transmitting fiat value since everyone you deal with is grudgingly accepting your funny money so they can turn around and sell it for the real money they actually want. Or in the case of your alleged employer, they want to pay you in actual money, but they need to have some of your pay skimmed off by another company which does the actual payment.

Defining a minimum security standard (e.g cold wallets, control of how keys are stored in the system and who can retrieve them, tripwire systems, etc)
Mandatory reporting of finances and reserves to ensure they have customers' funds
Mandatory insurance against losses
A minimum level of qualification and experience for staff who manage crucial areas of the business
Generally, in a similar way to how they ensure banks don't lose customer funds.
It doesn't stop hacks, but makes them less likely, and limits ttr amount of damage that attacks can do.

I disagree with you entirely, because this service is run by humans.
But let's say you're right. Shouldn't there be a way of incorporating fail-safes into the Bitcoin protocol itself? A daft contract would be able to do this (it would be the smartest use of a daft contract yet) but an actual feature in the protocol to help exchanges respond quickly and automatically to certain conditions. Would be good.
But nobody is interested, presumably because it involves commercial users voluntarily putting restrictions on themselves and the protocol enforcing those restrictions.

Fiat is money, it is very widely used to buy things and store value, and generally the value is very stable to facilitate that. Bitcoin is a bunch of people buying "coins" that don't exist in the hope of selling them to someone else at a higher price later on. It's not a currency when almost nobody buys anything with it and the value moves so wildly that you couldn't do any serious business with it.

You're piling assertion on top of assertion. Fungibility exists without privacy. The two are not linked.
Drug dealing doesn't work well without anonymity, though, which is where these "fungibility" complaints come from. It's not about the fungibility, it's about being able to deal in drugs and other illegal items without being caught.

I love how you advocate to allow the attacker to give back a small amount of the money they stole, so they can get away with $80 million of stolen money. Hey, if I could steal millions of dollars and then give back $1 million for Immunity, why the hell wouldn't I just keep stealing as much as I can?
Of course it's all the government's fault. Of course. Who made Bitcoin pseudoanonymous with no CHARGEBACKS? Who made it so you could send 119,000 BTC in a single transaction with nothing that could be done about it by the rightful owners? It's hardly a new problem as it happens several times a year. Who insisted that Bitcoin exchanges shouldn't be regulated so they are forced to follow some kind of security best-practice and be insured against losses?
That's right. The evil Statists made it that way.
@_date: 2016-08-01 00:15:14
You use services that convert Bitcoin to fiat so you can pay bills. You go to merchants that want to be paid in fiat money so you pay a third-party service Bitcoins and they send actual money to the merchant.

Because it was a theft of a legitimate, legal asset.


Only in your imagination.
The reason why they won't investigate is because Bitfinex will not contact law enforcement to make a complaint. Either because it's an exit-scam, or because they're worried about community backlash from getting "the jackbooted statist thugs" involved instead of the "neckbearded anarchist thugs".

Honesty is most important. Be sure to carefully explain that (excluding the mountain of evidence to the contrary) there was no way to foresee the exchange hacking. Practice phrases like, "this operation was the most trustworthy exchange running out of a vacant building in Sinagpore" and "no we can't just call the exchange, they don't have a phone number".

Dude, Bitcoiners don't spend Bitcoin. Not at $500, not at $1000, not at $10,000.
A few might, when the price goes up, but the majority do not. During the recent bubble around the halvening, nobody spoke about spending their profits. Only about continuing to HODL. People who sold or spent were derided as "weak hands".
During the bubble, posters at were complaining about their sales going down. I think you could reasonably extrapolate this out to legal transactions too.

My experiences are probably common across multiple Bitcoin communities - I've heard of similar things happening in the Linux community.

hodling and contributing to organised crime does not count.
The Bitcoin community is growing very slowly and may be losing people quicker than it is gaining people. Stores are abandoning Bitcoin due to people not actually buying stuff with it. New stores are starting to accept it though, so perhaps it's standing still on average.

If left unchecked, the demand for Bitcoin transaction increases as the block size stays constant. The end result, according to theory, is that the people wanting to transfer large sums of money will eventually crowd out everyone else.

I've never heard of a Bitcoin ATM being reprogrammed by an attacker and it certainly wouldn't be easy at all.
Remember, when you do a transaction you are not exposing any secret information.
3. Correct.
4. Your private key is used to encrypt the transaction data, it is never sent across the network. Your public key is sent across the network so other nodes can decrypt your transaction. There is no way to use a public key to figure out the private key.
5. Yes, true. It's a risk you have to take, though. Always get your software from Google Play Store or Apple's App Store, or some other place that is trusted.

We need First Seen Safe, or a proper zero-confirmation payment system. It's irresponsible to implement this hack without a real answer to zero-confirmation being available.
I get that zero-confirmation transactions are not entirely safe, but they work generally well enough for the moment until a real solution is built. Ruining zero-confirmation transactions at this point because "They weren't 100% safe anyway and maybe in the future you can use Lightening Network instead if they ever finish building it" is a terrible expression of Peter Todd's foolish pride.

Simple: OpenBazaar has most of the advantages of Silk Road (anonymity) which will attract a lot of that sort of crowd. And has already attracted attention from that crowd.
OpenBazaar is significantly more difficult to use than eBay, particularly because the average eBayer thinks that you need to be a computer programmer to use Bitcoin, so nobody is going to stop listing on eBay and start listing on OpenBazaar.
Which indicates to me that OpenBazaar will be used mostly as a dark market.

Even if there was a way, it's become apparent to everyone that you have used Bitcoin for an illegal purpose and you are trying to destroy the evidence. Anybody who helped you "delete your wallet" would become an accessory to whatever crime you've committed.

Newsflash for you all: If you commit a crime in one country then flee and lead a law-abiding life, you can be extradited for the crime you initially committed. This has always been the case, and not just when the requesting country is big and powerful.
If the initial crime is not a crime in the destination country then they may decide not to give up the criminal (e.g. when the crime was "free speech" or "adultery") but narcotics are highly illegal in Thailand.

How much does the lessening of privacy really matter when most users get BTC through AML-enabled exchanges and ATMs? If you are a drug dealer, just don't use RBF. (Preferably, don't use Bitcoin at all).
Zero-confirmation transactions were manageable by keeping an eye on several different geographically-diverse nodes to detect a double-spend. That's how payment processing systems manage the risk.
Full, non-optoutable RBF makes it difficult or impossible to manage the risk. Sure, miners can already implement it, but this proposal makes it easy.

Currently, zero-confirmation transactions are a manageable risk. This turns them into an unmanageable risk - which means nobody will want to take them, and it will be difficult-to-impossible to accept Bitcoin at point-of-sale.

What you are talking about is a combination of "Child Pays For Parent" and "Replace By Fee". RBF allows a payment to be redirected and CPFP allows for a merchant to cancel the redirection (although CPFP was actually intended to allow a recipient to bump the fee on an incoming transaction).
CPFP has not been implemented yet, so any fraudster can attack a merchant like this.
Even when CPFP is implemented, the fraudster has every incentive to try their luck. The worst that can happen to the fraudster is paying full price for their purchase, and the best that can happen is a substantial amount of the purchase price can be redirected back to the fraudster before the next block comes.
The worst case for the merchant is losing the entire payment. The best case is losing some of the payment.
TLDR: Merchants can't fight back until CPFP is implemented. Even so, payers are incentivised toward fraud.

That's the problem with most of these decentralised systems, or theories about how anarchy will work. They hand-wave over all the weaknesses and complexity of the system by saying "...you could pay somebody to do it for you".
This isn't a criticism of you directly. New ideas are good. More efficient ways, or fairer ways, of working are great. But this seems terribly difficult, unless you pay somebody to take away the complexity, and in the end the "coverage" you get is vastly inferior to a centralised solution. And once you've paid somebody to do the risk assessment for you, and paid somebody else to take away the complexity, it would be cheaper to buy real insurance that holds up in law and isn't just a few nameless people with wallet keys.
Forgive me for not reading your white paper, but the people who can contribute to this insurance would have to be pretty loaded, wouldn't they? Thinking about public liability or professional indemnity insurance, you need to have multiple millions of dollars of coverage. How many Bitcoiners have that sort of money lying around and want to lose its liquidity for a while?

That's a great analogy, for two reasons:

2. The rich people, who got onto the lifeboats, had distain for the riff-raff who could only afford a 3rd-class ticket. Such distain, in fact, that they prevented poor passengers from escaping the ship (3rd class cabins were behind locked gates).

Thin blocks, which Gavin explained in 2014, some XT developers implemented last year, and another developer implemented this year and tried unsuccessfully to get Core to even LOOK AT - is the obvious answer to the block propagation problem.

1. A 2mb block size will not, in real terms, increase centralisation any more than the 1.7mb total block size currently being worked on by Core. 300kb does not make much of a difference. If Core is worried about orphans it should have implemented the thin blocks code it was given.
2. The fees are 6 cents now, but block size pressure is increasing which will continue the increase in fees. Bitcoin can't continue to grow when there are "not enough seats on the bus" for the new users.
3. A hard fork showdown, as you call it, is not likely. What miner would continue to mine a coin only accepted by 25% of the network? Blocks on the 1mb side would take at least 40 minutes to find, causing more users to switch.
A hard fork is only a problem if the losers fight it with mining power. If the losers admit defeat and move along with the new fork, there is no danger - a position admitted by Core developers.

@_date: 2016-03-18 04:47:30
Firstly, there was never an "outright ban on guns". Only on semi-automatics. You do need to jump through hoops and do background checks to buy a firearm.
Secondly, gun violence is pretty rare here. If somebody gets shot, it actually makes headlines.
Thirdly, not even criminals own many guns. Whenever you see the police raiding a crime gang hideout they find knuckledusters, a machete, and occasionally a crossbow. Almost never do the police find a firearm, and when they do it's a pistol. Pretty difficult to commit mass murder with a machete or a set of knuckledusters.
 Black market weapons exist, but because fewer citizens own guns it's much harder for criminals to steal them. Hence they can get pretty expensive. Petty crims and home invaders don't have them.
Take it from an Aussie, we feel safer without every idiot owning a gun. And the statistics - REAL statistics - back us up.

Coinbase needing your ID is actually a good indication that they are a safe service. They follow regulations, which means they aren't going to get shut down for illegal practices. If they can follow regs then they are probably also following best practices in storage of Bitcoin.
Coinbase should only be used to buy and sell, NOT for storage of Bitcoin. This applies for all exchanges. The government is extremely unlikely to steal your Bitcoin but there have been plenty of thefts from exchanges by hackers or insiders.
And never use a "laundering" or "tumbling" service. They are very likely to give you coins used in a criminal transaction, providing a direct path for child porn investigators to YOU.

If nobody steps forward and says to the government "We are respectable and law-abiding and we use Bitcoin" then what do you EXPECT them to think?

You are living in full-blown fantasy land.
Illicit drugs are harmful - decades of medical science have provided ample proof of that. Decades of drug deaths, mental illnesses, and other major health problems caused by these drugs cannot just be swept under the rug or attributed to criminalisation.
Alcohol bootleggers were actual criminals. They defied a reasonable law ("Don't make alcohol, it's harmful to health and society") to line their own pockets.
You've stuck your head in the sand regarding alcohol. The crime never dried up. Drunken assaults still happen. DUI still happens. Drunk drivers still hit pedestrians and kill them. People still get so drunk they fall off balconies and down stairs and severely injure themselves and sometimes even die. It's not a crime to injure yourself, but it still has a cost to society. Try going to the ER on Saturday night and see how many drunks are causing the long waiting times.
Alcohol is so ingrained in our society that we'll never remove it, but we still have a chance to do real harm reduction when it comes to stopping the spread of drugs.
There is no such thing as "pretend criminals". Either you broke the law, or you didn't. Those people in prisons didn't go to jail for selling tomatoes, they are in jail for selling dangerous substances that cause a well-known and well-studied cost to society and innocent bystanders. Why? To line their pockets. They are actual criminals.

It's a good thing because it causes greater competition for fees, and encourages people to bump up the fees on a transaction that doesn't confirm, putting further upward pressure on fees.
Eventually you'll be able to send $1-$2,000,000 around the world for just $20, and the best part is, it'll keep the coffee-buying riff-raff out! Bitcoin will only be for people with delicious amounts of money. Poor folks who dine at "Subway" can go away and leave us in peace.

SegWit is great. But a SegWit soft fork requires a lot of time, and I remember some Core developers asking questions about the safety of the soft fork - and I don't think any answers were given!
By contrast, hard-forking to 2mb as a can-kick now, and developing SegWit and Thin Blocks, would get us out of immediate trouble and ensure that we have time to get SegWit and Thin Blocks all working correctly.
Perhaps 1.6mb is conservative figures for SegWit, but it's currently what Core is saying, so that's the figure I'll quote.

As I've pointed out a number of times, SegWit comes into effect in April but it will take months for wallets to actually start using it. There is little-to-no benefit if few people use SegWit. You only get increased capacity if a significant number of transactions are made with it. It could be six months until that happens.
As for the "is it 1.6mb or more", don't forget one of the arguments against the 2mb hard fork has been that the additional data throughput on nodes would be too onerous and people would stop running nodes. It would be a little hypocritical of Core to say "Your 2mb Classic blocks are too large, but our 2mb Core blocks are the right size!". So I think they believe the effective block size will be 1.6 or 1.7mb, no higher, at least until their SegWit hard fork.
Even that's a bit silly of them. What difference will 300-400kb really have on nodes and the network? Are we suddenly transmitting blocks on floppy disks?
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:51:29
Consensus: That magical thing. Obviously it doesn't have consensus when major miners and businesses have stated support for Classic and its 2mb blocks.
@_date: 2016-03-19 11:48:35
It would actually reduce:
1. Transactions that didn't make it into a block being re-broadcast by wallets
2. Transactions being RBF'ed because they didn't confirm quickly enough
The way it would work is through actually confirming transactions promptly, before they are re-broadcast or TBF'ed.
@_date: 2016-01-14 12:20:00
Unfortunately it will always be touchable by human greed and corruption. It could happen inside Core, and the folks at say it's happening now.

Now that depends on the amount of Bitcoin use, doesn't it?
Bitcoin's use has exploded quickly, but probably will not do so again. Perhaps the Bitcoin community may quadruple in size over the next ten years? If so, Bitcoin can scale on-chain using current technology.
If you are talking about Visa-like transactional capability or Bitcoin becoming the sole currency of the world, then please realise that this is extremely unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future. This scenario seems to be an appealing fantasy for the anarchy clique, so it gets talked about a lot, but really you might as well talk about sending Bitcoin to the aliens, it's so unrealistic.
If we need to reach Visa capabilities in ten years, that probably can't happen on-chain. It probably can't happen with Lightning Network either. Maybe in twenty years on-chain or ten years with some incredible off-chain solution? In either case it doesn't matter, because Bitcoin will not need Visa-level transaction volume. Bitcoin will carve out a niche for itself, but it will not be something that everyone uses every day.
@_date: 2016-03-01 04:49:52
No, you are very wrong. The witnesses will not be segregated in transactions UNTIL you upgrade. If 90% of the economic network doesn't upgrade, then the maximum block capacity ends off around 1.06mb.
Everyone doing transactions must upgrade in order to get the maximum benefit of SegWit. This will take some time. That's been quietly acknowledged by Core - while the code mag be available in April, adoption may take months more time. The more SegWit-capable transactions, the more capacity is available.
By contrast, a hard fork block size increase means people are kicked off the network until they upgrade. the block size will not be held back by old software.

"We all know that governments are puppets of the big banks"
Too simplistic. Banks were given a lot of power during the Great Depression, it was only intended temporarily, but it persisted through WW2 and the Cold War. Now banks are entrenched. The banks are too essential to everything, so politicians and governments simply can't afford to piss them off too much. Trust me, governments are not happy about this situation, but it's what they have to deal with.
Bitcoin does not present a credible threat to the banking industry. Banking is a lot more than just making deposits and doing transactions. Bitcoin could force the banks to change, but then this is an industry that has been changing almost continuously for the last 75 years.
I see governments generally taking a positive view of Bitcoin. It's a good, useful money that they don't have to waste time and resources in policing. It can be used as "international currency" reserves without them actually needing lots of different currencies on hand. It can be used in trade and potentially for diplomatic purposes.
In my town, government workers make up a large percentage of Bitcoin fans. Like, 10% or 20% of our Meetups are government workers. There are a decent number of politicians who are pro-Bitcoin here too.

Don't use a managed wallet or an exchange as your main Bitcoin wallet. The reason: If the website gets hacked or closes down, you could lose all the money.
Use an exchange ONLY for exchange operations, never store your coins in there for the long-term.
Instead, you need to keep your money under your own control. I use Blockchain.info, they have a web-and-mobile wallet that doesn't require you to cede control of your private keys. However there are still better options. I suggest using a mobile wallet like Mycelium or Airbitz as your main wallet, unless you accumulate a large amount of money in which case you should look at buying a Trezor or Ledger Wallet. Those hardware devices are currently the ultimate in securing your bitcoins.
All options I've mentioned are applicable to all countries.

If we can't scale to 3.5mb effective block size (maximum) which is what we will need within 5 years, then Bitcoin doesn't deserve to survive.
My own feeling is that Bitcoin will be perfectly fine. SegWit will allow nodes to ditch the signatures of old transactions to save on disk space, which is a plus.

Coinjar has "Hedged Accounts" which does exactly this.
I don't really see the point of it - basically they will sell your BTC for fiat straight away and then when you need your BTC again they will buy some for you. In your account they will show you how much BTC you "have" at any given time but the fiat amount never changes of course.

Bitcoin is like E-mail, but it transmits money instead of messages.
It works like a spreadsheet that keeps track of how much money everyone has. Every person using Bitcoin has a copy of the spreadsheet. When one person sends money to another person, every Bitcoin user is automatically notified of the transaction, and everyone's spreadsheets are updated. You know whether a person has the right amount of money to spend, because your spreadsheet already shows how much money they have.
Therefore It's impossible to counterfeit money in Bitcoin. Everyone will ignore a transaction using money that they know you don't have.
When you send money, you encrypt the transaction using a secret password that only you know. Everyone else can decrypt it with a password that everybody knows. If the transaction is encrypted with the wrong password it will not decrypt. That's how everyone can tell that the transaction has come from you, because you are the only one who knows your secret password.
I usually end with: Whenever Bitcoins are stolen, it's because somebody gave their secret password to an online service. We strongly recommend against that, but some people don't listen. If you keep your secret password to yourself, you will be the only one that can use your money, and it will never be stolen.

If that's the interest rate you're getting on a savings account, I feel very sorry for you. But everyone else gets a better rate than that.
The money in the bank is money they can easily access, borrow against, spend etc. It's also not subject to wild fluctuations. You will never send money from that account and it get stuck for several days because "you didn't add a high-enough fee". The bank even insures the money against loss if somebody guesses your online banking password, and the government insures it against Mt Gox-style SFYL scams.
You're also not subject to the whims of Luke "I'm not a security expert" Jr or Peter "I'll give back the money I stole if they ask for it" Todd in matters of monetary policy.

Listen to your dad on this one.
Taking out a loan to buy a volatile asset is somewhat foolish, considering you have no other proper assets at this time. You say your BTC is worth 6,000 francs more than your loan amount - I strongly recommend you at least pay back your loan and roll over your profit. Or sell the whole amount.
Your cheap, simple idea has probably already been done before. And it's probably nowhere near as cheap or simple as you believe it to be, remember that Bitcoin does not make you immune to regulation and tax.
Your idea of having it programmed by a student is frankly very naive. It *will* be insecure. Bitcoin is littered with startups that failed because they hired regular programmers to write an exchange, and then got hacked. Look up Shapeshift or Mt Gox, the classic examples. In order to store Bitcoin securely on a website you need a programmer with experience writing bank software or fiat trading software. A student programmer will simply get all your money stolen like most Bitcoin startups before you. That is, if the programmer doesn't just steal your money himself. Your customers will then accuse you of stealing their funds, which will have a very negative impact on your future job prospects.

As I understand it, the $10k rule is for personal spendings (so, if you buy dinner with Bitcoin you don't need to track how much extra value you got from the higher price). If you are selling Bitcoin for AUD, you need to declare your profits regardless of the amount, but obviously very small amounts are unlikely to raise any red flags if not declared.
I may be wrong though, I'll have to read up a bit more. I'm not an accountant or ATO officer, etc etc. Just reminding everyone of the need to declare because the ATO is probably extra-aware of Bitcoin after Craig Wright.

Bitcoin is actually not as big in Bali as some people would make out.
I was going to visit Ubud last year, but I got food poisoning in Bali and I was too sick to sit in a van for hours. I think there's only one or two Bitcoin-accepting places in Ubud, from memory. I was going to visit one.
On the way to the resort in Seminyak we passed a building with big Bitcoin signage, must be an over-the-counter exchange or something.
Bali is not a bad place to have a wedding, but don't do ANYTHING you wouldn't do in your own country, don't drink the tap water, keep yourself very hydrated, use hand sanitizer after touching Indonesian money, don't drink anything with ice in it or any "local" spirits.

Bitcoiners add Amazon items to their wish list. Carders offer to buy those items with stolen cards in return for the equivalent in Bitcoin (less a 5-30% discount - because the carder doesn't care about getting value for money on stolen cards).
Bitcoiner accepts the offer, pays the carder in Bitcoin, and the carder makes the purchase.
Carder has now turned their stolen credit cards into Bitcoin.
Bitcoiner then pretends that there are really people so desperate to buy Bitcoin that they would pay 30% above market value.

Irrelevent, in this scenario. And Bitcoin was mined out of thin air and all the altcoins are created out of thin air, so there's scarcely any difference.


Also irrelevent. The money in the bank is so easy to access that it may as well be in your own hands. Can you say that the Bitcoin money is in your own hands? No - because you only have the key to use it (similar to how a debit card is your key to use your banked money).

I disagree. This is an opt-in protocol between pairs of wallets that support it. It has a valid use-case. It doesn't clutter the Blockchain as it doesn't actually store any additional data there.
Peter Todd could simply say "We won't put it in Core" and everyone would respect that. But to call for a boycott of any wallets implementing this feature is childish.
Bitcoin is a technology platform, agnostic of any political ideology, especially anarchism. If users and businesses can make use of BIP75, then that's great - it makes Bitcoin more useful. If it's no use to anybody, then nobody will use it and it will have zero effect on Bitcoin.

You're being moronic.
Firstly, the CIA and the NSA are American authorities, not Australian.
Secondly, there is no "Bitcoin prohibition" in Australia.
Thirdly, the Bitcoins were confiscated as proceeds of crime - many different crimes, in fact. Your claim that they were hacked from legitimate owners is preposterous and is merely an anti-government rant on your part with not a shred of evidence to back it up.
Fourthly, the Bitcoin community in Australia contains much fewer anarchists than in the US (because our government isn't shit like yours) so there will be plenty of bidders.
Fifthly, you can't tell me what "the idea of Bitcoin" is, unless you are Satoshi.
Sixthly, what you claim Bitcoin is not about (getting rich for doing nothing) seems to be exactly what HODLers do, and what the existing scammers in the Bitcoin community do.
Lastly, if Ernst And Young sent out a press release saying that the coins came from XYZ molester's stash and ABC drug dealer's stash, you'd still be whinging about the government "stealing" Bitcoins from the convicted criminals.

Probably a sugar industry fabrication. They've been attacking aspartame for literally decades. None of their "research" has much credibility among actual scientists or the FDA, but that's not the point - as long as the ordinary person believes that aspartame is dangerous, that's the aim.
And really, why wouldn't the sugar industry attack aspartame? It's in widespread use and it tastes pretty good.

I will add that 14 cans of diet soft drink (5.3 litres) is the recommended maximum amount of aspartame, and the manufacturer probably never intended for anyone to drink that much ~every single day of the year~.
If you're getting to that amount of consumption, there are probably other factors that are raising your risk of heart disease more than the aspartame.

If KYC is necessary under law, it's necessary to do. That's not negotiable. BIP75 allows an easier way to comply with the law.
If the KYC is not on-chain, then transactions done with KYC are not demonstrably different to transactions done without it, unless you were the sender or receiver of that transaction.
Bitcoin transactions that don't go through KYC will be "cash" (peer-to-peer) transactions, like if I was to sell my lawnmower on Gumtree. There is no value difference between $10 cash and $10 electronically-transferred, despite the latter having KYC and the former not.

Certain Bitcoin transactions are subject to KYC anyway. This doesn't change anything, except by making it cheaper and easier to do it via a standard protocol.
I remind you that Bitcoin is NOT above the law. Bitcoin users must continue to comply with their country's laws regardless of whether there's native support for this in the wallet software.
Off-chain KYC does not affect fungibility or network neutrality. It's not recorded on the chain and therefore KYC-enabled transactions are recorded no differently to non-KYC ones.

Mt Gox, and similar incidents, have continually happened in Bitcoin. Even the most trusted exchanges got hacked or exit-scammed their users with stunning losses.
The truth is there is no guarantee that any exchange won't abscond with your money. Even Coinbase, which others have recommended, are known to arbitrarily freeze user accounts coincidentally at the same time you try to withdraw actual money.

Bitcoin has gone up because the people who already have Bitcoins are buying more, because they expect it will go up in price.

Very little is being bought by pro investors or new people. It's all folks who are already Bitcoin enthusiasts.
Bitcoin investment is a pure gamble, with uncontrollable risk. You are gambling on a community of socially-isolated misfits to make a particular decision (buy more Bitcoins) in the hopes that you can offload to some poor sap at the top of a bubble.

Average block size doesn't tell the whole story. Remember, some blocks are mined empty. Some miners still have a 750kb limitation. Some periods have very little transactional volume. Other periods have hours of full 1mb blocks in a row.

If you think that Bitcoin will destroy governments, put banks out of business, end all wars, and usher in an era of utopic anarchy, then you probably also think that governments are scared of Bitcoin.
I never subscribed to that meme. It requires suspicion, hate, anger and paranoia among its believers.

Newsflash: People are actually in support of criminals, like drug dealers, getting their money seized.


I'm constantly told that Bitcoin is better money, that it's already better than fiat currency. A few years ago I was told it was like the internet in 1996. Now I'm told it's like the internet in 1992. I think it's like a monowheel: impractical, unstable, deeply flawed and with no way to correct the flaws. But some true believers will continue to think monowheels are the future of transport, despite them not reaching mainstream popularity at any time in the last 70 years.

Lol, that's a serious case of euphoria you've got there.
The banks are not even slightly threatened by Bitcoin. Adoption of Bitcoin is very slow and the abandonment rate is fairly high. Bitcoin is an impractical form of money, prone to being stolen or lost or not arriving at its destination in a timely manner. Or at all. It's also difficult to use, particularly when blocks are full and there is competition for block space. And then you come into the volatility of Bitcoin...
Banks have already adopted digital currency. They are just moving further into it. It is to increase efficiency and reduce costs. With luck, it may even help international trade. They are not doing it to compete with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the punchline of a joke for the financial markets. Bitcoin makes big finance look ethical and clean.

Reputation with a pseudonym doesn't mean jack shit. Anybody can take one's pseudonym on another market, or you can use alts, you can sell to yourself to generate positive reviews, and you can use alt accounts on Reddit to leave yourself positive reviews (as some on have been known to do).
Get a bad reputation? No worries, just start a new pseudonym. Come on mate, this isn't rocket science.
Karma doesn't indicate the quality of comments or reputation. It just indicates your ability to participate in an echo chamber. I make comments that challenge r/bitcoin users, hence I get a lot of downvotes. Duh.

It's a crime to sell anything that is so hazardous to one's health, including drugs. For reasons obvious to all except the most stubborn anarchists and libertarians.
The exception to this is cigarettes, but mainly because it's difficult to stub out a "Big" industry that's survived for hundreds of years.
At least cigarette manufacturers are (where I live) forced to tell customers the health hazards. Drug dealers will break another law by false representation, telling customers that the drugs are harmless and won't hurt you. Drugs also cause a lot of well-documented social problems too.
I would argue that the reason they aren't successful in stamping out the drug trade is because they are not tough enough on it. It's an international problem, being treated as a national problem that starts and stops at the borders. Jail time isn't really that scary - it's time to put a punishment in place that will scare the living daylights out of predatory drug dealers.

I was hoping maybe you could elaborate on that.
I had funds in my wallet, sent to me from someone else and had days worth of confirmations. I logged in one day and found that there were no funds there. I logged out, logged in again, no funds.
I went into the bit where you can look at what addresses you have and the one that contained the funds was missing.
I did a search on your website (pretty sure I emailed you too) and found the recovery page which thankfully listed the correct key, and I was able to import it into a different wallet.
Maybe it had lost all the keys. All the same, I can't recommend your wallet if it is prone to sometimes losing your funds (until you do the complicated recovery process).
This was around 12 months ago anyway.

Sure. Have a low fee for non-time-critical payment, with the ability to add additional fee if you need things hurried up. That's what RBF should be.
But the RBF implemented in Core goes one step further. You don't just "add a higher fee", you can actually create a whole new transaction with a higher fee, that spends the money to a different address. This should never be allowed as it makes it too easy to commit fraud, and makes things more difficult for merchants and newbies.

In reality, the merchant scrapes their Bitcoin sticker off the window, because this is getting too complicated and they now need to know how the system works before they can actually use it.

Not solved. Newbie walks into a bar (this isn't a joke, sorry) and tries to pay for a beer. They've been playing around with their wallet and have enabled the RBF function, not even knowing what it is. Their payment is never accepted as received, because BitPay doesn't accept RBF transactions.
Oh, maybe it's received in ten minutes - but by this time the merchant has ripped their Bitcoin terminal out of the wall because the damn thing doesn't work. Or the user has just assumed that the transaction they sent did not work and that Bitcoin is a load of flaky crap.
Merchants don't want to know how Bitcoin works, or explain to new users how to disable RBF. They don't have time. They just want to get paid as quickly as possible. RBF messes this up entirely, even with your "solved" scenario.
@_date: 2015-11-29 10:29:14
Perhaps RBF is an attempt to oppose everything that Bitcoin XT does - "Bitcoin XT is the devil. If they try to prevent double-spending, then we should support double-spending!"

There is nothing wrong with trusting a third party to store your Bitcoins when that third party is both regulated AND insured.
Better to do that instead of trying to keep them safe yourself, with no insurance.
Obviously people have problems when they use unregulated and uninsured services, run by anonymous people. The majority of civilians who use money keep their money stored at banks with no dramas.
@_date: 2015-11-29 10:08:48
A successful double-spend with a zero-confirmation transaction, currently, is reasonably difficult to do.
With RBF, it becomes absolutely trivial to do.
Saying "Well, don't accept transactions that have the RBF flag set" is not practical in the real world. Newbies may set the flag accidentally (or in curiosity) and then be told that they've done the transaction incorrectly and now have to wait for a confirmation. Or that they have to cancel the transaction (re-transmit it to themselves) and then change the settings in their wallet and create a new transaction.
Ultimately, it's going to be a royal pain to do in-person Bitcoin transactions, and this will be a large barrier to adoption. With RBF, now you actually need to know how Bitcoin works in order to accept it. Why bother with accepting Bitcoin at your shop when you need to learn how it all works behind-the-scenes? You wouldn't - you'd just accept credit cards and cash, those "just work".
What's the use case for full RBF? The only one I've heard of is cancelling erroneous transactions or transactions that went to the wrong address. That's daft - Bitcoin was always intended to be irreversible, and with QR codes you'll never get the wrong address. The only use case for RBF that makes any sense is for the situation where you don't add a high-enough fee to get a timely transaction. It should be implemented where you can change the fee but you cannot change the output address. THAT makes sense.
As far as I can tell, people have been asking for the ability to add a higher fee, but nobody has asked for the ability to easily double-spend. Nobody wants the hassle of full RBF, we only want to be able to add a higher fee when it's necessary. So why press on with the change?!
@_date: 2015-11-29 10:22:28
I thought everybody had done that. If I recall correctly, my first ever Bitcoin purchase was a coffee, and my third was a beer.
@_date: 2015-11-30 09:24:14
With respect, it seems you have misunderstood how RBF works, and perhaps not thought deeply enough about this.
RBF does not allow for the receiver to fight it out with the sender for control of the money. A merchant cannot reissue a transaction that has been made to it under RBF. What you are thinking of is a combination of RBF and CPFP (Child Pays For Parent). As far as I know, CPFP will not be implemented in the next Bitcoin Core. Until CPFP, the attacker can double-spend without any way for the merchant to fight back, except by calling the police.
The neat little theory you have will fall down in practice. Even if the merchant and scammer can fight it out, there's always a chance - even a good chance - that the fees will not escalate to 100% before the next block comes and locks everything in place. If that happens, the scammer may either pay 100% or something less than 100% of the purchase price, and the merchant will receive less than 100%, perhaps even 0% of the purchase price.
In other words, in a fight, the merchant will always lose some money and the attacker will often pay less than they should.
All this means that everyone is incentivised to attack, and merchants are incentivised to simply stop accepting Bitcoin because it's too costly and too much hassle.
The "too much hassle" also becomes a factor when merchants have to be careful not to accept RBF transactions, and newbies get their transactions ignored by merchants because they were playing around with their wallet and didn't know what the RBF function was. Merchants don't have time to deal with a system that is getting too complicated.
We asked for RBF so we can add additional fee to a transaction. Nobody wanted to change the output address and commit a double-spend. This implementation of RBF is unwanted and completely unacceptable. We need zero-confirmation transactions to be more reliable, not less reliable.

"Damn" is what you'll all be saying when the $30,000 is used up with nothing to show for it.
I'm fuzzy on how this is supposed to work. Is it:
A. An Ethereum-based dumb contract that somehow must know the law and act within the law, while taking its data input from people who have no legal training, or
B. Lots of anonymous people with no legal training attempting to decide who is right and who is wrong, aka "The Court of Public Opinion", or
C. An attempt at creating a justice system that operates without any consideration for the law (because "The law doesn't apply on the internet!") where judgements are not legally binding because they are not based on legal principles? Or
D. An attempt to scam $30k worth of Ether by preying on anarchist wet dreams?
If the answer is B, then ask Lindy Chamberlain if she thinks the Justice system should be run by the public opinions of keyboard warriors.
If the answer is D, then I applaud Andreas. I wish I'd thought of it.

I have no idea of the fees for withdrawing from an Israeli exchange. Here in Australia it's 1% to buy (as is many places) and 1% to sell, making it very cheap to send money into Australia. Perhaps it's more in Israel. Perhaps less.
Rather than having your sister carry out the Israel part of the transfer, why don't you simply set up the exchange account for her and log into it yourself to do the "withdrawing" bit? That way she doesn't need to touch anything or know anything.
As for buying Bitcoin, in Australia we have a new service called Get Paid In Bitcoin, where part of your salary can be diverted into Bitcoin with only a $1 fee. The exchange rate is very, very competitive too. Perhaps there is something similar in the US. That would make things cheaper, and easier to do frequent remittances. You could "Get Paid" straight into your sister's exchange account each week.

IANAL, but the Bitcoin belongs to the estate. Just because they accidentally gave you a key to a safe, does not mean you are entitled to the contents of the safe.
You could argue that the private key was "part of the sale", but you have zero right to USE that key to unlock the wallet. The wallet is stored off-site (in the cloud) and the contents are not part of the sale because the contents of the wallet are not stored on the computer.
Besides which, the RIGHT thing to do would be to return the money. If you offer to return the Bitcoin they'll probably turn around and say "I have no idea what Bitcoin is or how to use it, I don't care what you do with it" and then you are in the clear legally and morally.

I agree completely that this came across as very childish, as though the typical commenter on Youtube 9/11 videos suddenly got control of the BF twitter account.
Your follow-up comments saying "I don't want to partner with an organisation that prosecutes raw milk farmers" just made things worse.
Bitcoin currently has a reputation of "it's only used by criminals". The recent publicity given to Cryptolocker in various media reports simply reinforces the perceived link between Bitcoin and criminality. It's important to destroy this perception and this can be done by opening lines of communication with law enforcement. Additionally, there is less likely to be negative regulation of the Bitcoin space if politicians can see we are taking the responsibility to be decent members of society.
Just to show how out-of-touch you are, exactly WHICH members were concerned that you would partner with the agency that checks your bags at the airport? I mean, who gives a spit? What did the TSA ever do to you, apart from attempt to prevent bombs from getting onto aeroplanes?
We could say that your tweet was a cynical attempt to get increased membership from the "Crypto-Anarchists", except that your foundation's website has no visible means of joining as a member, and hasn't for nearly the whole of 2015.

Perhaps one day, Bitcoin could take the inputs of all wallets that have not been spent or received for 10 years, and make them minable again after the 21 millionth. That would keep a mining reward without onerous transactions fees, and prevent the situation where lost coins are lost forever.

KYC is only a small part of the new regulations, and basically they bring Bitcoin exchanges in line with banks in terms of the kinds of things they must comply with.
Bitcoin exchanges must be registered as financial companies, they must secure their fiat and virtual funds correctly, they must be insured against loss, and they can be audited to ensure they are not running a fractional reserve or siphoning money out. In other words, Japanese exchanges will be actively prevented from Goxxing their customers. That's getting to be a real problem with Bitcoin exchanges, where several of them exit-scammed every year.

Coinjar is a good service. It's been around for years, has some good products, and is reliable. Most Aussie bitcoiners use, or have used, Coinjar.
Coinjar's founder previously founded another exchange. He sold that exchange and the people who ran it afterwards fell asleep at the wheel and got hacked. Allegations flew thick and fast around the Bitcoin community, but then, the Bitcoin community is full of baseless allegations about everyone.
Coinjar is headed by a good CEO, with hands-on investors who obviously want to make sure everything is as it should be.
I was sceptical about Coinjar when it first started, but I decided it didn't matter if Coinjar got hacked - I was not going to store Bitcoins on any online wallet or exchange. I was only going to buy Bitcoins from there, and then transfer them out immediately. Years have passed without incident. Just use Coinjar for buying. Don't ever leave your Bitcoins on an exchange, not even a reputable one.

Tip: NOBODY here will EVER tell you it's a bad time to buy bitcoins, even at the peak of a bubble. Probably the worst time to buy bitcoins is when people start saying things like "A bitcoin for under $10,000 is a good deal". That's just shameless pumping.
I think the price will slide further. Give it a month or two before buying as the amount of money going into purchasing Bitcoin at the moment is quite low. If you just want to have fun and experiment, buy a small amount whenever you want to and don't worry about price.
Always do your experimenting before buying large quantities.

The internet had clear advantages over the old ways of doing things. Bitcoin? ...not really.
Internet companies were continually innovating new uses for the internet. Bitcoin? ...not really. Everyone's just HODLing and waiting for MOON, or buying drugs because nothing better has come along yet for that purpose. There's no progress.
You could see a clear progression in the development and use of the internet in the 1990s, you can't see that in Bitcoin. A few years ago when I spoke to people about Bitcoin they claimed Bitcoin was like the internet was in 1994, but now Bitcoin is like the internet in 1992 apparently. You're getting further away from your goal.
Bitcoin is like Linux was in 2008: Everyone's certain that mainstream adoption is imminent, but nobody has any idea how to get there, and developers are fiddling around the edges instead of actually making Linux a more desirable platform to use.
How is Bitcoin expected to destroy the State? By allowing people to avoid tax? Please. Mr Taxman doesn't sit back and allow that. Plus, Bitcoin would need to become mainstream CURRENCY (not speculative investment) in order for any serious tax evasion to occur, and nobody is working on actual adoption.

I never claimed that Bitcoin contained nothing but illegal transactions. I've done plenty of legal transactions with Bitcoin. Even declared my profits on my tax return. However, Bitcoin has a problem with a high proportion of its users either using it for criminal purposes, starting scams, or providing moral support to drug dealers, tax dodgers, money launderers and credit card fraudsters.
That stink of criminality pervades the public perception of Bitcoin. If the majority of the criminals used Monero or Dash instead, for the increased anonymity, Bitcoin could become comparatively squeaky-clean.
@_date: 2016-07-29 00:51:06

Under a proper regulatory body, bitcoins stored by an exchange would need to be audited to ensure reserves were sufficient, the security systems were hardened, and that there is insurance against loss.
Most shonky players we see in Bitcoin today would not be able to meet the standard and would simply be refused a license to operate. If they started operating illegally they could be shut down and even imprisoned.
So yes, regulation is important in the real world. It's the reason why your Uncle with the pornstar moustache doesn't open a bank to rob people. In instances where the regulation has been insufficient, that doesn't prove that regulation is useless - on the contrary, it proves that the regulations need tightening.
But of course, you're operating under the assumption that Bitcoin is intended for use by drug dealers.
P.S. The traditional financial system is a thousand times bigger than Bitcoin, of course as an absolute total there will be more fraud in traditional finance. But as a percentage of the Bitcoin economy, fraud is probably 10-20%, whereas in the US economy fraud is about 2-3%. Duh.

The stuff is "tested" by putting it into your mouth/veins/nostrils, not by chemical analysis. Additionally, vendors regularly change suppliers without telling customers, so one positive review of a product doesn't mean diddly-squat for the next customer.
The review process does not capture any information about who died while using the drugs - dead men do not leave reviews.
Vendors leave their own reviews, so you cannot trust them.
Street dealers can be informed-on if they deliver a bad/dangerous product, DNM dealers cannot. The DNM dealers don't have much of a reputation to protect because they are anonymous, street dealers have regular customers who can identify them in a crowd.
And much drug dealing happens through personal networks, not on the street, where reputation is even more important.
On the whole, DNMs don't make anything safer. The anonymity factor probably increases the danger as it allows dealers to keep dealing for longer with less fear of getting caught and jailed.

Madoff got away with his crimes for so long because he was already a respected industry insider. Comparatively few others could do the same. It's quite difficult to fraudulently get a money transmission license or a license to sell securities unless you REALLY know your stuff - even legitimate businesses have trouble because the authorities go through you with a fine-toothed comb. See Bitcoin Group.
You've fallen into the old "Why make laws, criminals will only break them" trap. The regulations make it difficult for shonky operators. Some get through, the regulations are not perfect, but a lot are stopped at the first hurdle and a lot are prosecuted.
And as for Madoff, if there was no regulation of securities he would still be out in the community and probably pulling more scams.

No, with Bitcoin you just get robbed as soon as you send that money to an exchange. Or, if you're very unlucky, you'll be robbed when you connect your computer to the internet and you forgot to install a patch and attackers get into your PC.
There is also a chance that people won't be able to scan your QR code and will just try to type the address in manually, make a mistake, and then you don't get your money at all. Or they scan the QR code but do not add a sufficient fee and then the money returns to them in 3 days and you never see it.
But really, the chances are that you'll never see any Bitcoin donations because nobody wants to use Bitcoin cryptocurrency as a currency and everyone just wants to hodl. You might get a few penny shavings, but never be able to move those out of your wallet because of the fees.

We'll have to agree to disagree, but I'd like to point out that Bitcoin can't be a speculative investment AND a currency at the same time. A speculative investment is something you hope will grow in value if you hold it. A currency must be something you want to spend. If you hold onto currency, economic activity slows down - that's precisely what we're seeing with Bitcoin. People HODLing rather than spending.
If you use Bitcoin as a currency for legal purchases, you are in a tiny minority of Bitcoin users. Nearly every bitcoiner predicts that it will become the currency of the future, yet nearly nobody uses it as currency, and nobody supports a stable value for Bitcoin that would make it undesirable to HODL.

A tip for you: "Be your own bank" and "don't rely on the banking system" are not persuasive arguments. You need to talk about actual benefits to the user, e.g. "It's cheaper to send money overseas" or "It's safer to do a Bitcoin transaction than give out your credit card number".

@_date: 2016-07-18 17:35:19
No, we weren't talking about "all scams" including pump-and-dumps and 419s, we were talking about Goxxings, where you trust a company with your money and it takes the money or "gets hacked". Don't try to divert to talking about miscellaneous scams, the ones you mention are not targeted by regulation anyway.
So, tell me, considering the massive number of banks in the world compared to Bitcoin exchanges, how many banks just abscond with customers' funds, compared to Bitcoin exchanges? Remember, the banks are heavily regulated, Bitcoin exchanges barely regulated. If regulation was pointless, you'd see banks going down every few weeks at an even faster rate than Bitcoin exchanges.
