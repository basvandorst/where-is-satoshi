Bitcoin doesn't care if you are a fridge, an 8 year old, a 16 year old, or a 96 year old.
It does not discriminate. The question "am I allowed" presumes that there is some barrier or checks to be passed before being "allowed".
With Bitcoin, you do not need permission.

I'll hold my fingers crossed for FinCEN's comment on LN, otherwise they are just booting LN nodes from the US without actually preventing anything. You would think not having LN nodes in the US at all would hurt them more than LN nodes not having money transmitter licenses.

So why don't regular bitcoin miners fall under "money transmitters"?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:46:24
They will not. Unless sender or receiver does child-pays-for-parent with high enough fee.

No, you clearly do not. If you want miners to mine your ridiculously huge transaction and to stick it into public block chain for eternity, you're going to have to pay for the privilege.

Do they actually receive value? They can't take the money and run thanks to cryptography. They can't loan it out, either. I don't think that qualifies as "receiving".

In that case every Bitcoin node is a money transmitter, that's literally all they do, relay transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:35:51
How does the console not support it? Worked for me...
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:56:47
The issue at hand is control. They do not have control over the money locked in lightning contract.
The reason money transmitters need to be licensed is so that they don't do anything nefarious with the money under their control. In LN, nodes have no control.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:34:30
That is bullshit, a transfer is not a sale whatever they say.

Why should you need an additional incentive? You are saving on fees already.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:27:27
They don't need to transfer every utxo to segwit immediately. Just stop generating legacy addresses and generate only segwit addresses whenever a new address is needed.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:51:30
It would be nice if it worked that way, but that's not how it works unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:32:57
Your transaction is not settled. Either it will eventually go away from the mempool (and become spendable again, like it never happened), or it will eventually go through at which point Coinbase will credit your account.
You aren't losing your BTC, don't worry.

@_date: 2017-12-21 03:57:58
It is, but the node centralization argument is that it doesn't make sense to do it unless your friend charges *significantly* less fees than Amazon, or you transact with your friend so much that the on-chain fee of opening the channel outweigh the LN fees Amazon will charge to pass the money between you and your friend.

OK, so Bitcoin Cash is not backwards compatible. The hard fork had no consensus, which is why it's a split instead of hard fork.
Bitcoin may have hard forks in the future, provided that most of the ecosystem supports it (&gt;90%). 
For now, Bitcoin is whatever is compatible with 0.8. And there can only be one chain for that, due to reorgs.

I think this is a function of the fact that it stores the entire blockchain from the beginning of time AND also has to keep the UTXO set in memory, in addition to collecting unconfirmed transactions.


Probably scanning the UTXO set.


It's meant for advanced users. Also, I think it's pretty intuitive.


Not sure what you mean here. You see your balance up to the date the DB is up to in the bottom right corner.


So use other competitors like blockr.io. I don't think this should be built in to Core.


This is an unfortunate consequence of the lack of consensus on the matter of fees and blocksize in general. It's the best consensus core devs came to.


It could, but why? There isn't much benefit. The effort is not worth it, IMO.


Not sure how this could be improved.
In general, regular non-advanced users should run a thin client.

It shows ;)
I've been professionally programming for 5.


Have you even seen mock-ups of a proposed UI refresh posted somewhere? Because I sure haven't. Are you expecting core devs to do this?
Edit: whoa, this exists. 


As it is right now, Bitcoin Core is sufficient for my needs and I don't see much benefit in attempting to improve the interface. If anything, the UI and wallet functionality should be cut (or off by default, requiring a commandline parameter to turn on) so that non-power users stop attempting to use it.
Of course, it shouldn't be offered as the first choice of wallet on bitcoin.org either.
Edit: It would be a lot better if Bitcoin Core became completely headless with a selection of UI available to install separately to communicate via rpc.

Look. The GUI part of Bitcoin Core provides wallet functionality. The node functionality has no GUI beyond about -&gt; debug, because it's meant to be run on headless servers.
Clearly there isn't enough incentive for anyone to develop pretty graphs for the node functionality because all those that are able to do it have no need for it and see no need for it, and those who want it have no ability to code it.

Jesus that intrinsic value argument again. 
*Things that have utility have a base value based on how scarce they are (supply/demand curve actually, but details not relevant).
*Once speculation starts, the base value is irrelevant. 
*Bitcoin has a very low base value thanks to no-trust messaging, and one must use scarce tokens to send messages to prevent spam.
*These tokens therefore have value, and get speculated on, and that's the Bitcoin ticker.

Kind of but not really. Say you had your full node is off for 24 hours and it needs to catch up. So it needs to download ~144 blocks using, say, 8 connections.

No. It's not magic. If you manipulate one of the atoms, the other doesn't change its state.
Quantum entanglement is not really entanglement in any practical manner. Think of it like taking two identical compasses, taking them to one location and then freezing them. They will freeze pointing in the same direction (say 353°), and you would be able to see to where the arrow is pointing (353°) if you take it anywhere.
If you unfreeze one of the compasses and turn the arrow to 142°, the other compass's arrow isn't going to move.

You can request an invite from them directly, and they'll generally send you one in a day or two, or you could ask a member for instant invite.
They aren't actually a credit union, more of an online bank, but it's been pretty good to me. I buy BTC here and there in small quantities ($20, $70, that area) once every few days, and haven't had a problem.
They are in a good ATM network and they refund ATM owner fees, so you're likely to be able to find a free ATM wherever you are.

So it appears the FBI is indeed lying as it would have been impossible to do what they claimed they did.
Quoting from [forensic report](
24 | The critical configuration lines from the live-ssl file are:  
    allow 127.0.0.1;  
    allow 62.75.246.20;  
    deny all;  
 
These lines tell the web server to allow access from IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and 65.75.246.20, and to deny all other IP addresses from connecting to the web server. IP address 127.0.0.1 is commonly referred to in computer networking as “localhost” i.e., the machine itself, which would allow the server to connect to itself. 65.75.246.20, as discussed ante, is the IP address for the front-end server, which must be permitted to access the back-end server. The “deny all” line tells the web server to deny connections from any IP address for which there is no specific exception provided. 
25 | Based on this configuration, **it would have been impossible for Special Agent Tarbell to access the portion of the .49 server containing the Silk Road market data, including a portion of the login page, simply by entering the IP address of the server in his browser**. As discussed in ¶ 24, the server was configured to refuse connections from all outside IP addresses with only one exception, the front-end server IP. Certainly, the IP address of the machine that Tarbell attempted to connect with did not have this IP address, and the server would therefore have refused his connection attempt. 
Conclusion 
51. As set forth above, there are a number of factual issues in dispute that need to be resolved: 
(1) based on the Silk Road Server’s configuration files provided in discovery, former Special Agent **Tarbell’s explanation of how the FBI discovered the server’s IP address is implausible**;  
(2) the account by former Special Agent Tarbell in his Declaration differs in important respects from the government’s June 12, 2013, letter to Icelandic authorities. For example, that letter (which is Exhibit A to the government’s opposition papers) **suggests the possibility of an alternative method for the government’s identifying and locating the Silk Road Server**;  
(3) **former Special Agent Tarbell’s explanation is vague and lacks supporting documentary and forensic evidence that should exist if former Special Agent Tarbell had adhered to the most rudimentary standards of computer forensic analysis, but which he apparently did not follow, or failed to preserve evidence of his alleged work that could substantiate the government’s account** (and which the defense has now requested);  
(4) **several critical files** provided in discovery contain **modification dates predating** the first date Agent Tarbell claims Icelandic authorities imaged the Silk Road Server, thereby casting **serious doubt on the chronology and methodology** of his account; and  
(5) the Government’s version contains **additional inconsistencies, including items referred to and/or indicated by former Special Agent Tarbell’s Declaration, but not produced in discovery**. 
52 | These **discrepancies between former Special Agent Tarbell’s claims and the forensic reality of the discovery** cannot be resolved without an evidentiary hearing.

At some point, if you assume everyone in the world uses Bitcoin for everything, transacting Bitcoin on the actual network will be infeasible. This is a well-understood fact (perhaps not by the last wave of speculators). This is the reason why Bitcoin is not suitable for microtransactions, despite what people may say or want.
Bitcoin microtransactions and general everyday purchases will be transacted off-chain between more or less centralized entities (Circle, Bitpay, Coinbase, PayPal), which will balance their books in between themselves or in bulk over the actual blockchain.

Dude, wake up.
A mortgage is you taking a loan and repaying it over time.
If you take out a loan of 100 BTC to buy a small house, and have to repay that 100 BTC over the next 5 years (20 BTC per year let's say), you will be caught with your pants down because the 100 BTC you borrowed were already exchanged for the house you now live in, as Bitcoin keeps going up in price.
In a year the 80 BTC are as valuable as 8 of your houses, and you still haven't repaid the loan.

Um, you see, Bitcoin does not exist in a physical location, it is locked by a key within the SHA256 domain. Therefore, it is not possible to carry Bitcoin on you, you can only at most know (or have access to) a key to sign a transaction, nothing more.

Right now, the block generation rate is on average ~20% faster than it should be, overall. That means that 2016 blocks take 11-12 days to create instead of 14, which means that block halving will come sooner.

I'll attempt a short explanation.
Direct action versus indirect action.
I can attempt to improve my life by voting, convincing people, etc, etc - but nothing will actually change because I have no power whatsoever.
Alternatively, I can attempt to improve my life by directly affecting it with actions such as changing jobs, moving to a place with low taxes and generally using my environment for personal gain.
I used to be like you.
In 2011, I marched with OccupyWallStreet (while being employed by a financial analytics company no less) and only narrowly avoided arrest.
I've been donating money to PACs. I've been voting (for a third party, you can imagine how useless that is), I've been writing letters to representatives (to get bullshit canned responses).
Since then I've become disillusioned. Looking at human history, indirect action effects no change, unless something catastrophic happens, in which case the action is direct anyway.
I am done with indirect action for the rest of my life.

EWallet: A browser-based wallet or wallet service is an online account with an external provider where bitcoins can be stored. Examples include accounts on currency exchange Markets, online Services and with ecommerce transaction processors. This definition also includes Hybrid e-wallets. 
[Hybrid e-wallets](
These three types of wallets all have different levels of control that each scheme allows the user (and optional third party) to exert.

That's just ridiculous. Are you using blockchain.info mining efficiency stats? Those are still based on GPUs for some reason, while real world efficiency is orders of magnitude higher. 0.2 W / Gh is a good estimate for today's miners. How does your calculation fare?
Show your work please.

In Bitcoin, a [wallet is defined as a collection of private keys (one or more)](
Therefore, if you don't have the private keys, it's not a wallet.
An [EWallet]( is not an actual [Wallet](

No no no. 
There is no such thing as intrinsic value, it's a flawed concept arising from misunderstanding of value. 
I will attempt to explain. 
Water does not have intrinsic value, only utility value. 
If we had no use for water, we wouldn't find it valuable. 
Utility value of an object arises from intrinsic *properties* of that object, but there is no utility value if there is no one to give it value. Value is subjective. 
Gold's value 70 thousand years ago was most certainly zero. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 14:41:36

That is true, he (and me too actually) has no way of knowing and is betting that eventually Bitcoin will have **some** place in the world. 
Seeing what I'm seeing, it seems that it in fact will be used by at least some people in the future, assuming we don't move to a new decentralized ledger system. 
Enough rich and/or influential people have invested a lot of financial and social capital by now that I don't see them just abandoning their investment. 
Even if the cryptography is cracked, I can see society using Bitcoin's legacy ledger as a starting point, simply replacing the money protocol, but not the spirit and function. 
If I am right, we are seeing the initial wealth distribution of the currency of the future.

Can you please stop being stupid?
Publicly traded corporations have things like boards of directors which are appointed by shareholder voting. These boards make corporate decisions, including whether to allocate a tweeting marketing budget or not and whether to "deliberately manipulate people's emotions for the sake of gaining exposure".
**Getting mad at the way traditional corporations operate is like getting mad at the weather, shouting at a thunderstorm.**

The value of gold, just as the value of *anything* else comes from utility. 
There is no such thing as intrinsic value. All value is subjective, based on supply and demand. If an object has some inherent properties that are useful, we assign a value to the object that estimates its utility. 
If gold were intrinsically valuable, gold would have been valuable 40 thousand years ago, regardless of utility.
Do you think gold was valuable 40k years ago?

Sorry dude. This has been my belief for a few years now. 
I haven't actually seen any headline of that type today. 
I don't know how much time is left - 1, 5, 10, 20 years - but sometime during my lifetime shit will hit the fan. 
We could have a gradual contraction, or we could have sudden collapse. But nothing changes the fact that we have reached the limits of growth with current technology and that in order to progress a massive worldwide infrastructure overhaul must be made. 
I don't see the collective humanity having enough cooperation to prevent this outcome - mostly due to human nature of those in power in the world (not just the US).
Investments which would have made a transition possible have not been made, and now comes the time to pay the price for greed and stupidity. 
If you keep digging and pondering, you will see that what is most likely is a slow decline followed by a sudden collapse.

@_date: 2014-11-06 23:59:18


You are confusing two different and distinct operations - transaction confirmation and transaction verification.
Transaction verification is performed by every node on the network that receives the transaction in order to make the decision to pass it along or not. Transaction verification consists of verifying that the transaction contents are signed by the public key of the sending address and whether the input was indeed spendable by the sending address. This prevents bad transactions from propagating, as they are instantly dropped.
Transaction confirmation happens when transactions are included in a block. When that happens, the transaction is forever recorded in the blockchain, and nothing can undo that.
A [block]( is nothing more than a page of transactions in the ledger of transactions that is the block chain. Specifically, a block is generated when a miner finds one of the billions of possible values of *nonce* that would make the following number lower than [mining difficulty]( parameter: 
     hash(previous_block_header + hash(hashes of all transactions that a miner is including in the block) + nonce)
, where *hash* is the SHA256 function, IIRC. The miner, in return, receives block_subsidy (currently 25 BTC) + sum(all transaction fees included in block).
When block subsidy starts approaching zero or hits zero, the block reward will consist only of transaction fees.
The rest of your question is inapplicable once you understand the above, because there aren't any cycles freed as block subsidy dwindles down.

I am thinking perhaps Satoshi did think about it, actually. The first three halvings are significant to the currency supply, and the rest can be considered negligible. It is possible that the idea was to use the economic shocks caused by the first three halvings to boost speculation and thus adoption, since they loop onto each other.

Quantum entanglement does not allow you to transfer information.
All entanglement really means is that when you "entangle" two atoms, the states of the atoms will be the same, but unknown until observed.

A happily married 'misogynist', thank you very much, post history stalker. I probably get more sex in a day than you do in a month, but why do you bring that up?


So it isn't true that you intentionally misinterpreted my question, you are *actually* believed you were answering the question I asked? That says something about your perception, especially how you are unable to see in yourself "Your inability to parse simple statements and understand them in context."


For one, you could leave the petty insults behind, that'd be a good start.


Not really, no, I am quite self sufficient and don't need affirmation from internet strangers. It must be doing *something* for you though, since you keep clinging to it.


I thought I made it clear when one topic was over and the next begun? I mean, I explicitly stated it, what more could you possibly ask for? Even with your flawed understanding of other people, it should be clear.

I don't think you understand fully the impact of these things. As long as some portion of miners, officially sanctioned firms like Coinbase, Circle, and a couple major exchanges adopt the new scheme, everyone else will essentially be forced to play ball.
Surely there will be diehards that stick to the original fork of the blockchain, but if the government (or especially all governments that matter united) decide to enforce the new fork, there isn't much you can do, as both forks suddenly acquire their own price ticker, split from the original.

Why would anyone mine unprofitably? This is not a charity.


Difficulty adjustment.
If it's a losing proposition, you shut down operations, and other people who can still mine profitably continue to mine. When enough people drop off, the difficulty will adjust downward, making it profitable again. Bitcoin seeks an equilibrium in mining, it's literally in the code.

If you don't use an escrow and the seller runs with the money, you're screwed. 
You are basically mailing cash in an envelope, except no one can steal it in transit.

Here's a discussion. No BIP, but you can't just force a false dilemma down people's throats like that.
It's not BIP101 or nothing, it's "let's refine the idea more".
Here's an idea better than BIP101 already, and even already tested in Monero: 
@_date: 2015-08-11 20:45:34


No, no, no, NO, [we do **not** just have two options]( We have an infinite amount of options. Including the one I am proposing.
I am not willing to put together a BIP, but I'm sure these ideas have been discussed on the dev mailing list numerous times already.


This is like a total non sequitur. The latter does not follow from the former.
In my view, there needs to be just one hardfork, where we define algorithmic blocksize expansion/shrinking. Constant hardforking on schedule is not something that is good for sound money.

Well, shit.
Is there a comparable replacement?
Or is the next best thing Electrum?
How safe is it to continue using it as an offline wallet?
What I mean by this is the use case of private keys stored on an offline computer that never touches the Internet, where transactions are generated on an online machine, signed on the offline machine, and the signed transaction is broadcasted from the online machine.
Theoretically should be as safe as before, amirite?

[S2X intention]( is down to 79.17%, we'd still be getting an average of 1 block every 50 minutes until the next difficulty adjustment.
The fork is happening on block 494784, which means there will be 1152 50-minute blocks to go until difficulty adjustment. That's 40 days, assuming additional miners don't join in. I don't think this means death, although that remains to be seen.

The fork is happening on block 494784, which means there will be 1152 50-minute blocks to go until difficulty adjustment. That's 40 days, assuming additional miners don't join in. I don't think this means death, although that remains to be seen.

Miners have input as they are also users. But they can't force non-mining users to go along with a change of validation rules.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:50:22
Addresses are generated randomly on the fly. There are 2^160 addresses available, if I recall correctly.
That's a mindbogglingly huge number.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:25:32
True, but those were not consensus breaking attempts to force one way over the other. All hard forks Bitcoin has had to date were non contentious.
Attempting to push a contentious hard fork is ridiculous.

Nice try.
One CPU one vote would be great, but ASICs muddle the situation.

@_date: 2017-10-20 14:11:33
Seriously, lol.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:29:12
This is not correct. If miners leave Bitcoin for a fork, other miners will step in to collect transaction fees, and with eventually lowered difficulty, make tons of money. As more miners show up to the party, security will be restored.
Hashrate is a function of price and electricity cost, essentially.
The only thing miners decide is transaction ordering, not validation rules.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:47:33
Because miners are attempting to force a contentious hard fork that has no consensus? This is not about bkocksize, this is about governance, make no mistake.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:49:34
Quitting Bitcoin = mining an incompatible fork that users don't want.

There will be people communicating ALL transactions from one to the other, I can guarantee you that much.


There is no guarantee this will ever happen.


This is what I want to know. Specifics, details of this "advanced transaction".
As far as I am aware, the only difference between 2x and 1x would be the single variable change. Therefore to truly separate I need to mix with some freshly mined coins.

Just because you haven't heard it doesn't mean it's not going to happen. If miners hijack control over validation rules, why wouldn't they, as rational agents, tweak them to their advantage?
I don't believe they will succeed in this hijacking anyway.

The only way you can collect fees is by producing valid blocks extending the blockchain. This process is called "mining". Block reward consists of block reward subsidy (currently 12.5 BTC) + any transaction fees. This is the first transaction in a new block, called " coinbase" transaction (nothing to do with the company which just took the name and ran with it). This is the transaction where the miner pays himself.
@_date: 2015-04-09 12:19:36
The transaction is almost instant, it's the confirmation that takes an average of 10 minutes.
In contrast, a credit card "confirmation" takes 2-3 business days, and the payment is still reversible for a long time.

I linked your article to my friend who is actually qualified to talk about this topic, here's what he says (unedited):


like by itself its stupid but if you add more services then it can be somewhat effective.  
look at utahs population and ratio to homeless, compare to nyc its absurd. Independent housing is always available for the homeless, i would argue maybe 20% of all homeless at most does NOT have a drug addiction, and the longer they stay homeless the higher the chance is.
If they are hooked on drugs these independent houses will become drug dens. I know workers that do home visits to check on the people and the turn over rate and incident rate is ridiculously huge.  
The amount of support that needs to be put in place in NYC is not just support but more strict enforcement and the independent houses need to be under martial law to enforce the strict rules that nyc has but no one gives a shit about
ex  1 client was hospitalized bc she tried to make cup noodles in a cardboard box on the stove. after a 2 week stay she was discharged back to INDEPENDENT housing where she set fire and burned the apt. then got hospitalized again.  
There needs to be a giant paradigm shift, everything needs to change inorder to possibly be effective




shit that must be just housing not including hospital visits, medication and insurance billings. ex the client that started the fire was hospitalized over 51 times in last 2 years

That's right. Block header = hash of the whole previous block including transactions. It isn't a pretermined chain of hashes because you cannot know the header of block n+2 until n+1 is generated.
Block   
header: XYZ123 (hash of previous block)  
transactions: 105346  
Block hash (header + transactions): LKS876
Block   
header: LKS876  
transactions: 75443  
Block hash: LDH363
Block   
header: LDH363  
transactions: 75443  
Block hash: KDT513
You cannot change a single transaction in block  because that changes the hash of block  and then blocks  and  are no longer valid.
This is why it's immutable.


Because each following block is based on the previous block, and you cannot change the contents of any block without invalidating the chain of blocks that follows.


Who doesn't have the key? The member bank?


They are not using it to sync internal databases. This whole blockchain thing is to serve as a replacement for ACH (transactions between banks, not inside a bank), as far as I understand.


You conflicting with yourself. I explained that invalid blocks are rejected just like they are in Bitcoin because every bank is also a "miner" (ie verifies incoming blocks and is able to publish new ones on top of the chain), but you said "nothing like Bitcoin".

If there are conflicting transactions, only one of them is made and the other is rejected. If there is still dispute, a court will settle it.


So, in Bitcoin, in your opinion, miners don't reject an incoming block whose header does not correspond to the hash of the previous block?

No. The database is still immutable. A court order could force a member bank to "reverse" a transaction (aka make a new transaction that goes the opposite way), but the history stays in the data structure regardless.


Well banks deem themselves to be equals and they don't want a central administrator. **They want decentralization amongst themselves.** I think this is the key point you are missing.

That is impossible because satoshi is lowest denomination unit in Bitcoin. You can't split a satoshi.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:15:39
You should wait until your transaction is either "confirmed" (i.e. published on the blockchain by a miner as part of a block) or dropped from the mempool (i.e. nodes on the network just drop your transaction and your money hasn't moved).
If it isn't going to get confirmed, it'll get dropped in 2-3 days, at which point you'll be able to publish a new transaction with the same funds (assuming your wallet supports this).
Alternatively, you could *double-spend* with a higher fee - spend the same inputs as the ones you did for the transaction that isn't confirming. Since you are spending the exact same inputs, both transactions cannot possibly go through - only one will, most likely the one with the sufficient mining fee.
Alternatively, you could try to spend the unconfirmed change from your transaction (I am assuming the [0.008 BTC output]( is your change), with a high enough fee to incentivize a miner to pick up and include both the original and the child transaction. Search for "child pays for parent" if you want to attempt this.

I don't think that was the implication. The implication was that the government is *disrupting* the free market. I mean, look at the definition, again:


I'd say the act of stealing money and reselling it on the free market qualifies as intervention by a government, even if the sale itself qualifies as a free market action.

They can and will have "mining" aka generating and publishing blocks of transactions.
There is no need for proof of work or proof of stake or anything like that because each member holds a valid key, and a block signed with any of the "valid" keys will be accepted as valid by the other network members. The reason this works is because it's NOT public. 
Also, Joe Random probably won't even be able to connect to any participating nodes due to whitelisting of ips.

The "decision making" Satoshi refers to, from context, is transaction ordering, nothing more.
Point is, if the longest chain with the most proof of work isn't considered valid by my node, it's not the longest chain for me.

Selling stolen goods in mass quantities would certainly affect the market price for that particular good, how could you deny that?


Let's have a hypothetical here. Let's say US Gov found a way to slowly leech gold from all over the world, atom by atom, into a magic vault. As some point, they acquire 20% of all the gold in the world, and then sell it on the market. Have they intervened in the market? I'd say they totally have.


No, the intervention was the act of taking what's not theirs by coercion.

It protects the writer of software by letting him test his code before, for example, sending 0.05 BTC to some address from a 1 BTC input, giving 0.95 BTC to the miners because he forgot to specify where the change goes to.
