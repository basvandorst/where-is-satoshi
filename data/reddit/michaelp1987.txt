You're thinking short term capital gains which are taxed at ordinary income rates. If you hold for longer than a year you pay long term capital gains. Which is a lower rate, but still around 25%.

This is wrong. The article says that the 30,000 BTC previously seized is now forfeited. Before today they were only being held as evidence. Now they're property of the U.S. Government.

No, they have it now, it just took them an extra couple of weeks to start moving it. They also had the foresight to keep the Silk Road coins separate from the Dread Pirate Roberts' coins in the event that Ulbrict made a claim for them, which he did.
The government's motion yesterday was for the forfeiture of the Silk Road servers, the Silk Road bitcoins, and "any other traceable assets". The "other traceable assets" specifically included the DPR coins, but since Ulbrict made a claim for them, the judge only ordered the Silk Road assets forfeited (for now).
Anyone else was free to make a third-party claim (as Ulbrict did) within the timespan between October and yesterday, but according to the order, no one did, and that's why they're gone. I've read that generally the amount of effort and lawyers fees to claim a forfeited asset are only worth the effort if the asset is worth $25,000 or more.

Maybe not if you live in the US, but many other countries have different sized bills specifically for helping the blind, and Canada is literally printing braille on new dollar bills. Coins are also different sizes for this purpose.

Sorry OP, I regret my phrasing. That paragraph is misleading, it does seem to imply that this is a new discovery, but it's not.
There were two sets of Bitcoin that were associated with Silk Road. One set was the Dread Pirate Roberts' personal wallet, the "$130 million" that the FBI was allegedly able to associate with Ulbricht. The FBI was unable to effectively seize these funds, presumably because they didn't have the private keys. [They began to move the funds starting on October 25th, you can see here](
The other set was seized when the FBI seized the servers. To run the Silk Road servers, the private keys for Silk Road's customer's funds in escrow would have to be kept on the server. That is presumably how the FBI seized these funds so quickly. [They redirected them to this address on October 2nd]( Yesterday the seized funds were finally ordered as forfeited in a default judgement by a federal judge. Calling this the "most recent discovery" is misleading since they were seized earlier. 
The only reason I can think of to say that is that, perhaps the FBI had identified the DPR wallet before the Silk Road wallet, which makes sense. First arrest Ulbricht and seize his computer, and then find the Silk Road servers and seize the coins. Later unlock Ulbricht's wallet with a discovered private key. 
Just to confirm that this is the case, and the article isn't describing new wallets somehow hidden on the Silk Road servers, follow the sources:
1. Click the [federal attorneys announced]( in the article.
2. Find the link at the bottom of the press release (first link) that [links to the forfeiture order](U.S. v. Silk Road Partial Default Judgment and Order of Forfeiture).

I should have quoted this when I wrote that:

You'd have to first define what the "last bitcoin" means, since a particular "coin" isn't universally well-defined in bitcoin. I suppose the most obvious example would be:
1. A transaction that terminates a chain *c* of transactions
2. Where *c* originated from the last validated block that generated a reward
3. Given all transactions *T* in the chain were the first recorded transaction from the origin address
4. And all transactions in *T* were greater than or equal to 1 BTC.
I didn't do a fantastic job of defining (3), and if anyone in the chain ever broke (4) you'd have to come up with more rules for determining which collection of transactions to what address or addresses make up the "last bitcoin".
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:35:01
Exactly this. Also, in that system, what happens in this situation:
A -&gt; P 1 BTC
B -&gt; P 2 BTC
P -&gt; C 2 BTC
Now C has 1 BTC originating from A and 1 BTC originating from B in the same wallet. Now we have to define what happens when C transfers money to someone. Also not an intractable problem, but similarly not well-defined.

Good point, that's definitely another consideration.
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:31:26
You're right, but read my response for a full explanation: 
Your friend could hand over the private key, sure. But the question is whether or not they'd be more valuable. Since you'd have to trust everyone that may have touched the private key, that's the problem. As soon as someone doesn't trust you, they'd have to make a transaction to change the private key. Also, anyone could possibly send (donate) money to that address therby obfuscating the valuable BTC from the "donated" BTC.

Good point. I'll stop using it that way. I've been using "wallet" in the same sense as I've thought of a brainwallet as a "wallet".
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:29:51


Well, no. Many transactions can all have the same destination address. This can be seen by the [FBI's confiscation of the Silk Road escrow accounts]( They consolidated all of the major transactions (463 of them) into a single address.


~~Wallet is kind of a misnomer too. My guess is that the term "wallet" was used to imply that it contains many transactions, but honestly I can't tell you the actual etymology.~~


Your software may do this. I am not familiar with the particular functionality of Bitcoin-QT (and someone else should correct me if I'm wrong here), but my guess is that Bitcoin-QT has the ability to keep multiple ~~wallets~~ *keypairs* in a single encrypted file, and actually does perform these functionalities that you're suggesting, but all of these are non-standard to the Bitcoin protocol. My assumption (again assumption) is that, in the way you're using the software, which ~~wallet~~ *keypair/address* you transfer a particular amount of bitcoins from is used is abstracted from you personally. 


This is exactly right. What you actually do is use some (pseudo-)random-number generator ([or your own brain]( to generate a seed. That seed generates a private key. The private key determines the public key. And the public key is [transformed in a standard way to create a bitcoin address]( ~~*Because a public-private key pair corresponds to a single address, you can send multiple transactions to the same address, and thus the same wallet.*~~
So in essence, your bitcoin address is your public key, or at least your bitcoin address can be verified once you publish your public key with a tranasction. That's how you're able to spend bitcoins that people send to you.


I'm not sure if I explained everything. Did that at least help? A lot of what I learned was from the bitcoin wiki. If you understand a little bit about public-key security and one-way hashes (which it sounds like you do), it can be super-informative. 
*Edit: added the key information you were looking for to the end of the fourth paragraph in italics.*
*Edit 2: if Bitcoin-QT acts in the way I've described, this is actually good, since it's best practice to keep all of your transactions in brand new destination addresses. This helps prevent people from corresponding multiple transactions together and therefore using side-channels to determine who a collection of transactions might belong to.*
*Edit 3: Struck out edit 1 since it was misleading, and clarified all references to wallet.*

@_date: 2013-12-29 20:22:08
Not in the sense that you're thinking, but jump to the last paragraph for an exception, and the reason that it's not feasible.
To understand what a bitcoin is, you have to understand how it works. The name "bitcoin" is a misnomer. All the bitcoin network is, is a record of transactions to addresses with amounts (all transactions to a single address are collectively known as a wallet). The way new bitcoins enter the network (mining) is that when a person validating blocks (called a miner currently) successfully signs a transaction list (block) they are allowed to transfer a certain amount of bitcoins from the void to a new wallet that they control (they must have added this to the list of transactions before validation). 
To spend any BTC, you are basically just creating a transaction in the log from one address to another. That address may correspond to an existing wallet, or a brand new wallet (the system neither knows nor cares). In this sense, there never was a "last bitcoin" to begin with. Only a transaction to a wallet that was a reward for validating transactions.
You could possibly give someone the private key to your wallet containing the last fraction of bitcoin, but that person would have no guarantee that you've destroyed the private key, which means that all people possessing the private key to that wallet have the right to spend it. 
This is also why "physical" bitcoins are insecure. A physical bitcoin is just an address, with a private key that is hidden beneath some tamper resistant mechanism (paper sowed together or glued), sort of like the foil cap on a milk carton. What you're doing when you accept a physical bitcoin is trusting that the private key underneath the paper (or whatever mechanism) was destroyed by the original creator, leaving the only copy underneath the paper.
Since all the lists of transactions are public in the block chain, what you would be able to do is trace the origin of your coins back to the original transaction that created the "last bitcoin". In this sense, a transaction from that wallet could be worth whatever someone is willing to value it at. The caveat comes here: if anyone ever transfers money into that wallet, then there's no way to distinguish their money from the desired transaction chain. Since anyone can transfer money to anyone else, without permission, it would be trivial for any malicious person to do this.

I think he's talking about apps that accept Bitcoin as payment for in-app purchases, not wallet apps or utility apps.

Good point, certainly if anyone values coins from an origin address as more, then that fits the bill.
