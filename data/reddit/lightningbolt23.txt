No. Not a difficult question. I proved my answer above, I am waiting for a rebuttal.


Everyone else? No, everyone else seems to have understand what I was saying and nobody questioned me. Only you failed, singular. Nobody else is reading this post's thread now. 
[Conversing with someone who doesn't know what this is.](
It's the only reason why I am taking "yore" seriously, and you should be grateful.

My question: "Profitability is not a trait of a currency. Where have I said it is? Quote me on that."
Your answer that points to me apparently saying that profitability is a trait of a currency:


This ignores context. Bitcoin is not failing to be profitable as an ASSET. This is what I previously said: "[Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency] but it's technically a crypto-asset". This entire thread focuses on how BTC isn't really a currency, and shares little traits with actual currencies. Profitability being not it. 
Uh oh!

You ignored my last paragraph. Bait? [Sure, right]( The ole' "synta-whatsa-attack", you cannot tell the difference between "you're" for "your", I will invest in a dictionary and give one to you.
Bitcoin is not failing to be profitable, Bitcoin is failing to become an adopted currency; thus why I keep mentioning the white paper which you have never read. I never called the last four months of BTC a failure. Obvious straw man, you're desperate. This is not a complete crash, so I hope you invested in a _financial_ dictionary.

I've taken it as a sign that you have zero self-awareness and cannot have a sensical conversation without being vague. Of course, you are the person who confuses "you're" for "your". Again, could you repeat what you said and try to relate it to what I said about Bitcoin's main purpose as stated in its white paper? 
You're talking about people profittering off its failings. I'm talking about why it is failing and Bitcoin's goal. Two separate topics. I do not care about the former, because it is not the focus.

A currency is not intended or supposed to be an asset, you do not "invest" in USD etc. There's nothing to report, but it's technically a crypto-asset. Did this get through to you? Hello, is this thing on?
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:28:46
You literally made no sense with that post. Edit it or try again by posting a new one. If you attempted to mutter out that Bitcoin is failing because it's being used as an asset rather than a currency, then well done, Sherlock.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:52:13
Goddamn, I really got deep inside your head. You're obsessed with me, son.
Anyway, the issue is that cryptocurrencies are not supposed to be a speculative market, and profiting off that hurts them. If you read what I said, I'm not criticizing opportunists nor are they truly relevant.

Treating Bitcoin like an asset harms the point of cryptocurrencies, I honestly have no idea why people are holding it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:46:50
You can spend it. The problem is that Bitcoin is like the now deceased Zimbabwean Dollar, there's no practicality.
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:41:05
If people stop using Bitcoin to buy actual things with like its white paper intended, then you will be holding bags of nothing once it bursts.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:29:55
A currency cannot "be profitable", it's exactly why Bitcoin right now is being treated as an asset or an investment and hence is profitable. How many times must I say this?
Profitability is not a trait of a currency. Where have I said it is? Quote me on that. Please read what I say carefully, it seems like you're replying just to pretend you have a related point to make.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:02:23
That's nice (I think), but could you do what I asked you to do if you want to be correct for once?


I repeat: "Profitability is not a trait of a currency. Where have I said it is? Quote me on that."
Are you literally admitting you created a straw man argument? Because this one is very clear.

It doesn't matter what you spend the energy on. You wasted electrical energy typing up that even more useless comment. The idea is it's better to push green energy rather than get rid of POW algorithm cryptocurrencies, as that will pollute a whole lot less than the former, considering how a few Chinese factories probably puts Bitcoin energy consumption to shame.

Moral of the story: HOLD

That isn't too surprising, is it? We need to move to green energy faster than ever.

It's their fault for using HTTPS, that shit just slows things down. You have to take off the S, which stands for the SLOW protocol (Seriously Lagging On the Web).

Your ISP still knows where traffic is headed, even with HTTPS, I believe. Add to this that the website knows your IP, so "no evidence" is a huge stretch. Maybe from your computer...

Exactly, folks! If they really want to speed things up around there, they need to use FTP for their entire site, which stands for Faster Than Superturbo. Encryption is no biggie, just use MD5, which stands for Maximum Dispatch 5, first coined by famous computer scientist and cryptographer Kit Duncan.

Precisely, comrades! If we take that hashing and times it by 5 due to MD5, we get more coins; thus, more BTC. The only thing vulnerable is your driver's license in that (or rather those) new lambos you just bought!
