If you are paying ATM fees for fiat then you need a new bank. Charles Schwab high interest checking account is great. It is free and they give unlimited ATM fees back. It is also great for spending in foreign countries.

That's great! My father called me the other day to tell me he accidentally threw away the paper that had his Apple ID password on it so now he can't login to Netflix (he thinks they share a password). Glad one of our dads has some kind of handle on current technology.

This is the only way real adoption will happen. We need banks to store our crypto, insure it, and give the average person a way to use it. We already know that keeping it on exchanges is not safe. This is a great step forward.
