Yeah, if bitcoins were funds, that would be great.  But 99%of people will need to turn those bitcoins into local currency and that takes time, and fees, and now you've lost a lot of that selling point, especially against services like popmoney.

I'm always amazed at just how crazy far libertarian/anarchist some bitcoiners are.  Honest to God, look at [the shit in this thread alone](  Bitcoin needs to move beyond this absurd anarcho-capitalist community before it takes off in the mainstream.

So, because "fuck banks," you pay a fee to cash your paycheck at a check cashing place, and then since you will need to pay bills and things, you presumably buy a prepaid card with cash, so you add another fee on...
Do you have a credit cards?  Do you know your credit rating?  Do you know, or can you estimate, how much you lose a year because "fuck banks?"

    Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary,
    System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor,
    Longing for the warmth of bed sheets, still I sat there doing spreadsheets.
    Having reached the bottom line I took a floppy from the drawer,
    I then invoked the SAVE command and waited for the disk to store,
    Only this and nothing more.
    Deep into the monitor peering, long I sat there wond'ring, fearing,
    Doubting, while the disk kept churning, turning yet to churn some more.
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token.
    "Save!" I said, "You cursed mother! Save my data from before!"
    One thing did the phosphors answer, only this and nothing more,
    Just, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"
    Was this some occult illusion, some maniacal intrusion?
    These were choices undesired, ones I'd never faced before.
    Carefully I weighed the choices as the disk made impish noises.
    The cursor flashed, insistent, waiting, baiting me to type some more.
    Clearly I must press a key, choosing one and nothing more,
    From "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"
    With fingers pale and trembling, slowly toward the keyboard bending,
    Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored,
    Praying for some guarantee, timidly, I pressed a key.
    But on the screen there still persisted words appearing as before.
    Ghastly grim they blinked and taunted, haunted, as my patience wore,
    Saying "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"
    I tried to catch the chips off guard, and pressed again, but twice as hard.
    I pleaded with the cursed machine: I begged and cried and then I swore.
    Now in mighty desperation, trying random combinations,
    Still there came the incantation, just as senseless as before.
    Cursor blinking, angrily winking, blinking nonsense as before.
    Reading, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"
    There I sat, distraught, exhausted, by my own machine accosted.
    Getting up I turned away and paced across the office floor.
    And then I saw a dreadful sight: a lightning bolt cut through the night.
    A gasp of horror overtook me, shook me to my very core.
    The lightning zapped my previous data, lost and gone forevermore.
    Not even, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"
    To this day I do not know the place to which lost data go.
    What demonic nether world us wrought where lost data will be stored,
    Beyond the reach of mortal souls, beyond the ether, into black holes?
    But sure as there's C, Pascal, Lotus, Ashton-Tate and more,
    You will one day be left to wander, lost on some Plutonian shore,
    Pleading, "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

Thank you.  The second link is particularly useful.  I hope people in this thread read it.  I hope bitcoin outgrows it's anarcholibertarian whackjob beginnings.  If bitcoin is going to take off as a widely used means of transferring value, it needs to spread beyond the angry college students and doomsday preppers who make videos like this one.

I keep my emergency fund at Ally (a direct bank) and my checking at my local credit union, so I can use pretty much any ATM and exchange foreign currency at the the best rate.  Best of both worlds.
And then of course, my investments at Vanguard.  Except bitcoin.

Yes, but metal, gunpowder, the things that guns are based on, have changed very little in a century.
Computers in 2100, however, will be dramatically more powerful than they are now.  There will likely be quantum computers which will break SHA, and at the very least disposable computers in every item you own.

Seriously.  This subreddit is half people who are legitimately interested in, but realistic about, bitcoin, just as they would be any emerging technology, and half fanatics who can't admit that the price would ever fall or that any business might not want to transact in bitcoin.
I don't think we should be worried about this correction, though.  The pattern has always been price -&gt; bubble -&gt; falls to twice the pre-bubble price.  I sold at $1050 and I'm going to buy back in if it hits $400 or when demonstrates it's out of free fall by consistently gaining over 8-10 hours.

I get you're trying to do the right thing, and it's very commendable.  Giving to charity and supporting bitcoin at the same time.
However, you might not know that the [Salvation Army is very anti gay rights.](  Their website makes it clear they think marriage is hetero by definition, and encourage all gay people to live celibate lives.  They said they would pull out of New York if they were forced by the city to provide the same benefits to the same-sex partners of their employees as they provide to the hetero spouses of their employees.
American Red Cross, Goodwill, Toys for Tots, Doctors without Borders, and Heifer International are all great charities which are not bigoted and make wonderful alternatives to the Salvation Army for those who don't feel comfortable supporting prejudiced organizations.

I WANT to spend my bitcoins like a currency, I do!
But it makes ZERO sense to do that when they're worth more every single day.  If I spend .1 bitcoins today on an item that sells for around $100 US, and a month from now bitcoins are going for $2000, then I essentially spent $200 for a $100 item.
Once the exchange rate stabilizes, I'll spend.

Not really.  If you choose to give that money to a less backwards charity, it's still a charity and will still use it to help people.  Giving to the American Red Cross instead of the Salvation Army doesn't reduce the amount I would otherwise give and does send a message that I do not approve of intolerance.
