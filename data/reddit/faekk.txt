whow that is great !

I would keep it totally offline, in a paper wallet or "cold storage".  The safest, easiest and fastest way is probably to buy it from localbitcoins.com. Look for a seller with a bunch of sales and with a 100% feedback score
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:37:26
links over there ----&gt;
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:25:23
It's a form of, poor phrasing by me
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:15:09
In Sweden we pay taxes on the profit
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:04:22
Yeah the comment section is pretty much aids
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:58:44
That's a good attitude. Welcome :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:10:23
In Sweden we pay 30% of the profit once we've sold the bitcoins for fiat
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:32:43
Good decision :) 
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:32:47
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:48:38
It is
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:36:51
No you don't have to accept it. What is you current wallet ? ie is it an online wallet like blockchain's ?
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:09:18
I think the video is fine, even good for bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:58:37
First create a new wallet, and send it to the Bitcoin Adress of that wallet
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:20:13
I'd look for a trusted seller on localbitcoins.com :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:47:42
yes you transfer it from your mtgox account using the bitcoin adress of your paper wallet. You use the coins by transfering them back to an online wallet
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:28:29
You pay the exact amount. Bitcoins can be divided into tiny tiny bits
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:55:42
*upvoted*. I'm a rebel
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:55:46
Welcome :) ! enjoy 
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:52:32
you send it to the bitcoin adress printed on the paper (not the private key, that one you should never show anyone)
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:13:48
I guess you could just use the bitcoin code and tweak it, it's public. That's what most of the other alt coins do.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:06:00
$10,000 dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool ?

Paper wallet. To be able to sleep at night not having to worry. An online wallet can always be hacked, a paper wallet cannot. It really depends if you trust yourself to not lose the paper. If you really want an online wallet I suggest checking out blockchain.info

@_date: 2013-11-24 11:16:07
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:10:58
Guess you mean "accept" ?  
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:43:40
It cannot be hacked (if done properly)
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:20:26
This is good
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:58:32
Yeah just take your time and do your research properly and you'll be fine :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:25:19
Localbitcoins.com :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:54:58
Yes, finally ! 
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:20:52
haha made me laugh, thank you
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:09:00
haha this is great
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:37:10
Basically, keeping your bitcoins online is always a risk due to hacking etc. Paper wallet or "cold storage" if done properly cannot be hacked. A paper wallet is up to you to lock away, threat it like cash. 
*edit: 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:16:37
What's the point of this ?
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:58:47
Congratulations ! :)
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:25:34
right :P
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:39:09
Don't really know what information you're looking for but here's some basic info:
Firstly you will need a wallet. Checkout blockchain.info for a good online wallet. A wallet contains two things, a "Bitcoin adress", this is the address you give people who wants to send you bitcoins. It's perfectly safe to share the "Bitcoin Address". The other thing is the Private Key. The Private Key IS your bitcoins. It should never be shared.
Second thing I guess is buying the bitcoins. I prefer localbitcoins.com. On there you either meet up with a person IRL and give them cash and they transfer the bitcoins to your Bitcoin Adress. Or you do a bank transfer. Look for sellers with high Feedback score and alot of previous sales.

The word "crash" should be banned on this subreddit
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:44:07
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:10:24
If you want a online wallet you should check out blockchain.info :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:44:14
Spends atleast some. Encouraging people to take bitcoins as payment in their stores or w/e. It's crucial
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:43:56
Still waiting...
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:55:57
Best.. well it's down to personal preference really. I buy my coins from trusted sellers on localbitcoin, and I use a paper wallet. If you really want a online wallet I can recommend blockchain.info

Market cap at 21 million. There are currently 12 million ish I believe
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:29:16
If you buy from a trusted seller at localbitcoins.com there shouldnt be a problem
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:31:46
Welcome ! :)
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:28:20
Saying "No offense" doesn't make it any less offensive
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:47:41
It wont matter how many coins there are left. Because the coins left will increase in value. You can split bitcoins into tiny tiny bits, so the amount wont really matter
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:13:32
Those are extreme steps. If it's possible for you to do it, you should. But PROBABLY not necessary
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:42:59
 print out 5 different paper wallets, send the  bitcoins to the bitcoin address located on the top left of the paper
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:31:27
I think most of us are in it for the long run, so no :)
