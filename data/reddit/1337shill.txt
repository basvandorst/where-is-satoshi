Do you have evidence to the contrary or are you going to keep making memes until it's proven that Craig really is Satoshi?
By then you'll have really missed out.

Burning natural gas at your house is far more efficient than converting it to electricity and back to heat. If this weren't the case, it probably wouldn't be cheaper to do so. Further, natural gas is so safe you can burn it on your cook top in your house. That is a 100% efficient heater, just not as safe as far as carbon monoxide goes.

This is stupid. All miners are heaters and neither is basically any less efficient than the other. Unless you get into heat pumps. Natural gas is a cheaper option, but equivalent efficiency. Of course hard to mine with natural gas unless you use it to power a generator.

Thanks for clarifying.
Might agree with you if you were comparing a generator at the house to one in a power plant, but natural gas at the house is pretty darn efficient. You still get conversion and line losses from the power plant to you. The only real losses are if you're not breathing the natural gas exhaust, which is normally the case. I did have an apartment where there were unvented heaters and they always seemed sketchy to me. You're also supposed to crack a window. And while the thermal efficiency is 99% then, in reality you're burning more gas because you're letting in more cold air.
In some places the natural gas is coming out at a certain pressure and cannot be kept lower.  When a house isn't burning the gas, the gas company is (talking about the torches you see all around oil fields). In the Permian Basin (Odessa/Midland area in Texas), natural gas is almost free as a result and if anything not using it is wasteful. Of course it isn't that way everwhere.

Yes, exactly: 
Out of date, but at one point had Tor relays that when funded enough, would buy more Tor relays.

This is awesome. Thanks for not blocking Tor, unlike earn.com's API.

This looks an awful lot like [SporeStack]( to me.

Been around since the fountains were handing out 10 BTC. I think I'll be okay.
@_date: 2019-05-02 01:39:46
How so?

If coinjoin isn't perfect or there's any possible leak, you might be tracked. If you use two different mixers (or a mixer and say coinjoin), if either one is broken in any way you should still be okay.

You're right, faucet. Thank you.

Not seeing any kind of API if you wanted to use it at scale.

I have followed him some and I think it could go either way. However, I have a friend who I trust quite a bit who's done a lot of research and is convinced. Either way, adding BSV support was pretty trivial and the unlimited block sizes are pretty cool. Seeing them do some neat stuff, so I figure why not.
Even if CSW is a fraud, the amount of stuff they're putting into the blockchain makes it potentially promising to me.

I'm betting that less than 2% of the servers built have had anything to do with spam or hacking. It's an antiquated idea that people have to own servers and have accounts. Why can't servers buy other servers? Why can't people write services that spin up some higher level thing on SporeStack and the user pays for the service without giving away their information?
Spam/hacking results in a deleted server and a waste of money. If anything, SporeStack has probably had less malicious use than most hosts. Most spam/hacking relies on "free" hosting, so if a malicious user can create servers with a stolen credit card or gets some promotional, they will almost do that.

Sure, or you could run `doublemixer mix --currency btc --output_address 1...`
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:04:47
Why not? it's a cryptocurrency. Low fees, high throughput. You don't have to use it.
