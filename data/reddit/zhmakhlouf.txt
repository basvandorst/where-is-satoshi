Why? How long does the first transaction take time?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:54:02
Yeah i plan on buying 200$ of bitcoins first and see how it goes , if i can forget about them and not panic and get good sleep then ill invest more 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:01:37
I like high risk high reward better , also this money is the extra money of the extra money and i am not impacted by them ( i dont spend through them) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:48:54
Yeah i plan on doing that
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:56:13
What ? Is it bad?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:46:04
I think its going to dip and stabilize at 13000 and then spike up alot (maybe 25k)  , i have noticed a pattern on the bitcoin price chart that every spike has a 20% dip behind it

Thank you :) is there a good book on exchange for beginners like me ? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:29:21
Cant now i can tho tomorrow morning so should i buy tomorrow? (if it stayed as the same price since anything can happen now)
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:21:06
I would be more sad if the opportunity to quadruple those 500$ vanished 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:26:36
It wont take much of my time ill make sure to achieve balance in my routine
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:44:58
I use my mother's stuff
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:35:02
I have been on this subreddit for a month , and i was interested in bitcoin when it was 8000$ but couldnt buy any , bch is too shady so i wont do it , and also i will only invest what i will 100% wont need
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:29:52
I dont use coinbase i use blockchain :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:08:51
I would much rather have biographies written about me than a police report on how i died
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:57:30
Yeah you are right , you can only try to predict in crypto
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:50:39
No i was saving originally to buy a gaming PC but i kinda lost interest in gaming so i found that bitcoin may be the wisest decision 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:30:13
not possible i need to go sort some shit at the bank
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:36:55
btw coinbase says it isnt available in my country , i though bitcoin is supposed to be anonymous 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:49:49
well in my war-torn country we stopped having laws so its 100% legal to use bitcoin without any taxes and no one is gonna confiscate them , you should come to syria if you are considering to become an enterpeuner so you wont have to deal with taxes 
P.S : before you start thinking that "this whole time i have been talking to an isis or alqaeda terrorist" , i am a normal citizen living under the Syrian government i am not a terrorist , i have had many conversations on the internet that lead me to uncover my country and then they just assume i am some sort of islamic jihadist radical terrorist, i was interested in bitcoin mining and investing because i noticed its price has not been going down , but i guess not anymore

thanks :)

how does this make bitcoin illegal in my country, is buying organs from the deep web more legal than not paying taxes ?
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:42:38
bitcoin is sometimes used to buy organs in the deep web , and no one has made bitcoin illegal , how is using bitcoin in a country that has an embargo ban on it illegal , i just wanted to invest :(
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:09:22
but isnt bitcoin supposed to be a fee-free service ? i am new to this so i am not sure
