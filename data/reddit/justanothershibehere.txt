I would switch to a different pool for a few hours, see if that pool accepts your machines work. If cex is only registering at 4 ghs that's highly unusual. Switch to another pool and see if they register the same problem. If not, it may be a bug with cex trying to sync you up with their network if their is such a thing.

If you solo mine theres a very very small chance (C&lt;0.0000e-16) that you'll find a block. If you mine with a pool, it would take maybe 6months to get 0.001BTC . I would solo mine or set up your own node to help the network if that's your thing. You won't make extra income with it though.

Why do you want these people paying millions of dollars to advertise on a football game? It won't stop the arms race and won't disrupt the fed itself.

If trying to help others adopt to Bitcoin, I imagine setting up a wallet and transferring funds would be easier than having them sweep funds off a paper wallet. If your sending through physical mail I suggest a tracking number and delivery confirmation. Some sellers, through eBay, sell one penny with a 2 btc gift, price at $1000 or whatever the price, they send one penny to you through air mail and be done, no charge back. Unless they send you the penny in the mail back, then file dispute with their tracking number.
Also, if your worried about charge backs, Bitcoin doesn't allow charge back. Just saying.

I have no idea what economy or money is. But its seems that world wars that have been fought for the past eighty years has been made possible by unlimited printing of money. With Bitcoin you can't just create a billion trillion Bitcoin to pay soldiers salaries, gasoline for planes, cars, trucks, boats, helicopter, or purchase said planes, cars, trucks, boats, helicopter, the guns, the bombs, the rockets, the clothing for military people, the food to feed them, misc expenses, every tiny thing associated with war can be made possible when the ability to print unlimited money is available. With Bitcoin the individual people would have to contribute the funds. You know what's best for you, but this is why I stick with Bitcoin, whether failure or freedom.

It seems as if bit pay is trying to position itself to be the visa of Bitcoin. You don't need to use your own wallet, its complicated, to complicated for you. We'll be the third party, the person pays us then we pay you, and its free! But there are pay walls, if you need to raise your limit or need phone support, you'll need to upgrade your plan. Our cheapest plan starts at 0.91 BTC or 30 days. You can still use the free service with little support, but were going to share your private financial information with whomever we deem worthy of it.

bitcoin is ALSO not backed by anything: A lot of bitcoin advocates love to bring up that normal centralized banking money is not backed by anything (gold, metals, whatever), but neither is bitcoin.ow consider my idea: why don't miners provide calculation services rather than just being personal space heaters

Bitcoin is backed by an emerging economy, a growing economy, and its producing jobs and a space for entrepreneurs to develop new products.

In a Bitcoin world, merchants accept Bitcoin. Some kids get reloadable cards today, imagine Bitcoin cards linked to a wallet.

Bully could steal his card but without pass code cannot get funds. You print another card and give it to your son and he finally gets bubble gum.

The following is an opinion: I would go with cloud mining, I would buy an basic machine and mine yourself, you won't get a lot, but you'll get little by little if your hearts set on supporting the network. If your hearts set on making money or you just want Bitcoin to play with, then buy from your exchange. I would stay away from Cex.io cloud services, they profit you don't.when you get coins, transfer them from your exchange to a private wallet, if your he exchange shuts down, you'll lose your coins if they're holding them. The preceeding has been an opinion.

[My post last Thursday](  has gotten up voted because the bulk of the community, I assume, agrees. There are flaws being addressed but this company has been around for the community and is on the same team. However, if I had a large amount of Bitcoin on blockchain.info wallet and lost it, I would be a bit upset perhaps too.

A way for the address to be hidden underneath of an account name pseudonym. Instead of me sending Bitcoin to say 18DzoDMxjAPWcRs8mhpAZjSvcp7tox8URo which was the most recent address on the block chain, I would send to RobsTireSource, even if the guys name is Jeremiah and he in fact owns a chair factory, this is the name he chose to label his address. Although there's five hundred Robs who own tire stores that want that name. This is similar to when I create a website and all similar domains are taken. If I sell jigs, then jig.com jigs.com thejig.com thejigs.com are all taken ad infinitum. In the future it would be more convenient to send to YourNameHere, then to 18DzoDMxjAPWcRs8mhpAZjSvcp7tox8URo however difficult.

You could be on reddit posting "I remember in 2014 I had the opportunity to buy at $400 and didn't!!" Or bitcoin fails miserably next year and a random altcoin takes the lead. No one knows. We have NEVER seen a decentralized network based on trust to distribute value without a third party in present times. No one knows whats coming. Good luck in your choices.

Well I would suggest write on a piece of paper EVERY service you've tried. If the coins were sent from localbitcoins, I assume you wouldn't send it to another localbitcoins wallet, so cross localbitcoins off the list. Go one by one and really tale your time to figure out how many public keys you've made with each service. And again, I can't stress enough, write all this down on paper. Its amazing how seeing it written on paper can jog my memory regarding other things. I'm assuming the account belongs to you, because you were opening accounts and sending money back and forth to yourself. So the keys are yours, for sure, writing I imagine could help.

Same with BitPay signing businesses up without proper knowledge of the Bitcoin protocol. Their chief compliance officer worked in the legacy system for over a decade working with the FDIC and federal reserve. These companies are a giant joke. What if the US treasury began putting Bitcoin ATMs in businesses, photographs your face and ties that coin to you. There was one stipulation I saw once where the company required you take a "selfie" holding your government ID, and I'm sure people were silly enough to do it.

The caterpillar approached the mushroom. The mushroom, being so brightly colored, was of great interest to the caterpillars eyes. Butterfly landes on the caterpillars path, blocking the caterpillar from reaching the mushroom. The caterpillar asks "Good butterfly, why is it that you have blocked my path"?  "Only he who has knowledge may partake of this fungus, do you so possess this knowledge?" The caterpillar, angered at the butterflies remark, was still attracted to the butterflies lively attitude in speaking his question. No smite or hate or anger or judgement on the butterflies part. The caterpillar replied "yes, I am ready for this". "No" replied the butterfly, "your an ignorant prick who is not ready". "Ouch, that was harsh" replied the caterpillar. "Why do you assume this" the caterpillar asks. "I was once just like you, now I have knowledge that you do not currently possess". The caterpillar kills the butterfly and eats the mushroom. The last words the caterpillar spoke before the poison of the mushroom killed him was "I regret nothing". They're both dead now, and the mushroom regrows.

Look at recent block found by popular pools. Research which pools you like, payout structure, how they determine shares, etc. Then join one. For example, btcdig hasn't found a block since July, join their pool and you haven't got a payout since July. Join a larger pool and your payout will be split between 6,000 people. Consider running your own node in the future or do p2pool

Severe problem number 3 was laughable. I particularly like where the author states "I'm not a cryptologist". Electronic transfer of value going back to Bit gold and b money and back to pubkey cryptography in the late 1970s has been building slowly towards a complete system. Bitcoin has found a solution to these 30 years of research and progress. 
Thank you for this link, that was very enjoyable.

I agree, he is a crazy person. However, I'm not a cryptographer. The idea seems to be predicated on fear of centralized mining, but overall missed a main point: the block-chain is not centralized, there is no central authority.

This is a cool idea. I had an idea to help businesses transition to a Bitcoin payment system. Additional payment systems are useful right.

The US dollar fluctuates. You don't feel it day to day, but it does. Gold fluctuates, last month it went from $1200 a troy ounce to $1450 in one hour! Bitcoin can't be a set price. If it was set at $86 and I was willing to pay you $100 or you were willing to sell a bunch for $75 each, that echoes through the collective. Its worth what someone is willing to give for it. Used to be 2 BTC could get you a book online, now 2BTC can get you a new laptop. I can't see how it could ever be set in stone.

Is it your contention that if I send half a Bitcoin to someone in exchange for U.S. dollars, ie they are purchasing an assert from me, than I am committing a federal crime? Can you point to a U.S. statute that states this, or even that Bitcoin is a currency? I think in Switzerland its considered a currency and you need a banking license to exchange it past a certain limit. This post is way off topic though. If you give your private information to a company to use their services, great, noooo problem with that. I'm asking, that if their are a lot of hoops to jump through, why one would usethe service?

I might have misread satoshis paper, clear this up if I'm incorrect. In order to attack the network, the attacker would have to start at the very beginning and remine all the previous blocks to catch up with the current state of the network. Therefore, if 16,000 miners are connected to a pool, they wouldn't get any reward because their hashing power isn't being used on current blocks with rewards, the hashing power would be used on rehashing old blocks.

I meant if your card ending in 6587 bought $1,000 then you try again the machine might reject the card because its the account that has already met its $1,000 limit. I was suggesting 5 different cards from five different banks, maybe two debit and 3 credit. I've said it before, but find a local miner that's willing to sell. Individuals who have mined 600 Bitcoin before the mining industry exploded generally won't mind selling a fellow 13btc (roughly $5,000). Find them at meet ups and local community websites. I've never used a coin base or circle type company. The Bitcoin ATM will surely receive my cash when they arrive in my city. Best of luck!

My math to calculate the fee:
Current rate on the BPI: $273 US (£179.9)
So 0.7BTC should cost 0.7 x £179.9 = £125.9
You paid £135 which would mean your fee to access BTC was [£135 - £125.9] / £125.9 = 0.0727, or almost 7.3%
Don't worry about these types sf things, you got a great deal in my opinion, and convenient. Some people take selfies hold government I'd, thumb prints, dick picks, and asshole DNA tests in order to have a centralized exchange allow them to buy Bitcoin.
I recall in the archives on BitCoinTalk a thread where a guy was trying to sell 5 BTC at $9.00 each and someone chimed in that "Bitcoin is selling for $7.90, what are you trying to scam us!" And he was very upset that this guy was sell for x% above market value.

Im ignorant. That being said, when I first heard of them I looked at their website and staff. The chief compliance office worked a decade with the FED and FDIC and legacy banking. These "types of people" is my ignorance and judgement. With Bitcoin, I can send money to you, just me and you. You have a laptop, I send you money, and you hand me the laptop. With bitpay, they are third party intermediaries, similar to visa. They keep track of transactions, and get people involved in Bitcoin, who otherwise might not get involved. Does Bob, 65, tackle shop owner in Seattle, need to accept Bitcoin? With bit pay, he receives cash in his bank account, converted from Bitcoin that you paid. Bitcoin goes very deep in my mind, the possibilities. I just see Bit pay as the VISA of Bitcoin, and that they are irrelevant.

Mining doesn't stop, it achieves a state of equilibrium at every level. My equipment runs, if everyone got of the network, then I would receive the incentive rewards and fees. Someone else wants some they rejoin the network, difficulty increases, and we both work at the next block. Their is always an incentive for creating and receiving Bitcoin. When you said "mining will stop...." and claimed I think this is true, that is where you thought wrong. There is always incentive for a miner to verify transactions.

Bullshit. Your rationalizing because you'll be getting paid for your work. I don't support the militia, BUT if I was being paid for fighting in the queens army I would talk about how GOOD it is to national security to have a standing army.
You don't have to write code in order to receive bitcoin. That's stupid.

What do you want to accomplish? I have a site that I bought with Bitcoin and pay the host servers with Bitcoin but I just put information on it, scientific papers written about Bitcoin, calender of events, etc. I don't make any money though. I didn't plan on making money in this way. What do you want to do to make money? Most web services have an agora cart service. You could sell something for Bitcoin. Idk.

This states that any changes to the protocols acceptance rests ultimately with merchants accepting Bitcoin. If an implementation is broadcast, you can accept the new change, or stop mining. (I have no proof of this statement)

Johan gave a 30 minute talk on the Bitcoin game about how one hacker was sweeping wallets and sent the money to address that started with 1aa.... and 1xy..... I assume you lost your money. Always send your money to a change address when you send funds and create new wallets for each transaction.

Do you have evidence that this is what is happening. Unless an individual or group has a strangle hold on the entire market I can't see this claim as true. A large group with enough volume buying or selling at the same time can make the price move, but this written piece appears to have underlying tones of an overlord moving the Bitcoin price on their own which I can't accept without proof.

Let's say Xcurrency was at .0012 3 months ago and is on a steady decline. Now you can buy at .0005, if you buy NOW hoping that it will go back to the peak you'll double your money. Great. But what happens when it declines to .0003, then .00023, and so forth. No one, especially me, knows what the price is tomorrow.let's look at the opposite. You buy at .01, then it goes up to .012, then .016 nice right? Then it starts downwards to .015, then all of a sudden its at .009, your not gonna sell at a loss so you hold, .008, .006, .005 etc. So it peaked at .016, but you had no idea that would be the peak, what if you bought at .01 then sold at .015 and the price over three days shot to .481!! You word have multiplied your money 48 times over (is you put in $100 and now you have almost $5,000)
You don't know what the price will be, so to imagine you'll buy at a low point and sell at the high point is silly. You don't know where the peak is and you don't know when the price will drop substantially. All that on top of trading fees, in my opinion, is just not being prudent with your finances.
If you want to play around with it, trade a few currencies and learn about these things, great. Don't put all your savings into Donald duck coin and expect to make 2,000BTC trading it.

"I don't know where I sent that transaction to" the wallet you posted has 10.09 Bitcoin. I don't understand the issue, is it that you can't access the funds? I would go back to each service and attempt logins one-by-one. Before doing this though, I would suggest get a piece of paper and write down all of your keys, passwords, etc. I have written down all of mine and never misplave funds. I still have my information written down from moolah.io accounts. I hope you resolve this issue, but my suggestion is start writing on paper so it does not happen again.

One issue with 0-confirmation transactions in the real world rests on the miners. I've made transactions with too low a fee and it wasn't included in a block and eventually refunded back to my wallet. If I were to start buying all over town with Bitcoin and set 0 fee for all my transactions, there's a chance some of them would be reversed.
@_date: 2015-02-24 07:43:35
The irony is hilarious. You trade your fiat with coin base for Bitcoin. Coin base then tracks how you open your Bitcoin. So Bitcoin has a "need to know" of its customers customers. Why so upset when the bank does it but not when coin base does it? They're both corrupted.
