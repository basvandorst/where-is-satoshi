But it doesn't impact what they charge for other things. If they changed their interest rates to pay for it, their customers would shop around for loans which negates the intended impact of the perk.  This is coming directly from margin they would have otherwise made on the existing loans.

That is only true in a public blockchain. Your definition of security is for a single entity using enough mining power to take control of the network.  If the blockchain is private, there is no need for security through raw hash power.  You could do security through consensus access.  Eg. you can only mine on this blockchain if a majority of current miners agree you can mine.  Then only enough miners are needed by each member institution to ensure reliability in case of large scale failure and for transaction confirmation.

The private blockchain wouldn't need that type of open innovation. It would be designed for a singular use case such as ownership of securities and clearing of accounts. 


I wouldn't give any of my money to what passes as an "exchange" in the bitcoin world. 


Clearing does not mean confirming.  A credit card transaction confirms within seconds.  This is one of those talking points that is repeated by bitcoin proponents that cause people to just point and laugh. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:05:00
That does not describe the current system.  The current system has the brokerages and third party middlemen as a trusted authority.  This system would decentralize trust across the financial institutions.  I don't think you know how modern finance works. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:28:40
You don't get permissionless innovation in bitcoin either.  There still needs to be consensus among the miners for any new innovative change to bitcoin.   And the financial institutions won't need to run mining hardware.  Blockchains don't requiires hundreds of MWh of electricity by default.   The problem with the replicated ledger is that if the ledgers become unsynced then someone has to be an authority to decide on the single version of the truth.  A distributed blockchain database does not have this issue.  
I guarantee if blockchains see any widespread use in finance it will not be on the back of bitcoin.   There are too many risks and lack of adaptability to their use case (financial transactions need to confirm much faster than 10 minutes).  They also already hire the best engineers and programmers in the world and pay them top dollar so building their own blockchain is not out of the question.  They will not use an inefficient systems that ultimately leaves them at the mercy of "public" miners. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:42:00
Why would financial institutions trust their security to a group of Chinese miners?  Doesn't it make more sense for them to develop their own blockchain where the only nodes and miners are from relevant financial institutions?  Financial institutions don't trust each other since dealing with other financial institutions involves counterparty risk. One of the reasons for the creation of a central bank was a clearing house of accounts where banks could pay each other what was owed at the end of the day.  The only members of the clearing house were the banks themselves.  I could see a similar blockchain clearinghouse for securities where the only members are the relevant financial institutions.  They don't need bitcoin if it's a private blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 04:24:45
Government can raid their data centers and seize their servers now. If joining the private blockchain requires consensus among the other members, the government can't attack it by joining it or with hash power like the public blockchain.  It would need to physically seize part of the blockchain which exactly the same as the current system.  This is not an issue financial institutions are worried about, only anti-government ideologues seem to care about the government controlling everything. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:53:55
Depending on who the loan is being given to.  The bank may trust they will get their money back somehow, but they still may not trust the entity.  E.g. I don't think banks trust the students they are giving massive loans to, but they trust the government has a method for them to get their money back. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:39:43
Bank consider perks like that marketing expenses since people are more likely to get loans at the same place they do their banking.  They take a hit to their margin to ensure future business.

Central banks buy and sell bonds on the open market.  They do not create currency through will.   There is an expansion of credit in fractional reserve banking but a corresponding contraction in credit when rates are increased.  The system is basically a free market in debt where available credit expands and contracts based on perceived risk. 
I wish you ancaps and libertarian types would actually crack oepn a book on how finance and central banking works instead of taking your cues from other libertarians and random blogs like zero hedge. 
Edit:  To expand on my first point, nobody who is lending money trusts the person they are lending to.  That is the entire point of interest rates.  When that trust diminishes they charge more for loans and total credit decreases.  The system is trustless and self-regulating. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 00:24:13
But there are many private internets that are based on the IP protocol.  A private blockchain would be a private implementation of the the opensource bitcoin protocol just like a corporate intranet is a private implementation of the TCP/IP protocol.    This does not mean that the intranet relies or needs the public internet in the same way that a private blockchain would not need to interact or rely on the public bitcoin blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 04:21:55
No this wouldn't replace any of the actual functions of a central bank except possibly as a clearinghouse nor would it set any monetary policy.  It would just be a ledger of who owns what securities. This operational work, not policy and decision making. 
And you just need to set the consensus threshold higher.  If it takes 90% of participants to agree to change, there is little chance of institutes ganging up on each other. (Not to mention it would likely violate existing collusion laws). 
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:52:09
Again, a member of the public would not build it.  A consortium of financial institutions would agree on the design and implementation of a private blockchain which would be built by their highly paid software engineers.  They would not use an "off the shelf" blockchain in the form of either bitcoin, an altcoin, or a random company's software. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:09:43
To put it another way, there would be no central authority in the private blockchain.  It would be decentralized across dozens of financial institutes and any changes would need consensus.  Why would random members of the public be needed for a blockchain that only financial institutes will use? A system can be decentralized and private.

The enron 401ks themselves were fine.  The problem is that most of them were filled with Enron stock since the company provided huge discounts on employee purchases of enron stock and the employee match was defaulted to be paid in enron stock.   The rest of the funds in their 401k were fine.  No employee who had a simple diversified 401k allocation lost money in their account just because enron went bankrupt.

Because the federal reserve doesn't use math at all.   Not to mention just because a system is governed by math doesn't mean it's a good system.

Employee RSUs work exactly the same way.  You get taxed on the initial receipt of the RSU and then you get taxed again on any gains if you hold the stock and sell at a later date.  This is exactly how bitcoin works.  If you mine a bitcoin and the price is $500 the day you received it, you owe income tax on the $500.  If you sell a year later and the price is $800, you owe capital gains taxes on the $300 ($800-$500).  If you sell at $400 then can deduct the $100 loss from the rest of your capital gains tax bill.

So what's the market cap for the US dollar or RMB or the Peso since you seem to consider that to be a valuable measure of a currency even though it makes no fucking sense.  You can't create "value" by adding a new currency so "market cap" is meaningless.  Forex markets are a zero-sum game.  Any increase in the long-run bitcoin exchange rate comes from taking % share in worldwide transaction from other currencies.
But of course no one thinks of bitcoin as a currency.  It's currently a speculative investment likely to go through several more years of bubbles and crashes to either finally burn to the ground or get enough support to become a viable currency outside of internet drug tokens.
