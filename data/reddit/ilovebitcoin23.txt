Could not happen with 1MB blocks

"Viacoin is the first digital currency to launch blockchain 2.0 technology on an altchain whereas all previous efforts have focused on leveraging the bitcoin blockchain. However, those attempts to use bitcoin been fraught with technical and political challenges because so far Bitcoin developers have considered those uses as spam and have taken technical measures to prevent them."

Bitcoin did not always have 1MB block size limit. How do you defend 1MB as the default option when it is not? Your conflict of interest is becoming clear. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 03:53:06
The majority of the community is for it. The burden is now on the other devs need to release an alternative plan or disprove Gavin's plan. 
1MB is not a long term solution and it was never meant to be.

I would imagine they are no concerned at all considering the fact we can only handle 400k TX per day. In other words less than 1% of the world population can use Bitcoin with breaking it. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:22:34
Are you serious? That is the basis of the argument against block size increase. The main concern is the increased cost to run a full node.
@_date: 2015-05-31 09:50:41
is gold limited to 400k TX per day? 
@_date: 2015-05-29 10:40:40
If we can manage a block size increase, Bitcoin will be preforming transactions between machines. Think of Nasdaq and colored coins, the Medici Project (Overstock.com), or Counterparty (XCP) which requires Bitcoin to operate.

Wait until this block size limit is figured out. As it stands now Bitcoin will never be more than a niche financial instrument. 
Currently less than 1% of the world population would be able to use Bitcoin given the current block size
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:13:14
This is starting to get ugly. There is no scenario where Bitcoin is the World Wide Ledger with 1MB blocks. This debate is whether Bitcoin should remain a niche financial instrument or if it should be the World Wide Ledger. I am yet to hear a reasonable argument why anyone would oppose Gavin's proposal and that is quite concerning.
I would support Gavincoin, at least he is offering a fix to a clear issue instead of making a company to profit called Blockstream. Remember, 1MB was not a hard limit implemented by Satoshi.
@_date: 2015-05-31 07:25:45
I might start by doing something about the fact that we are currently limited to 350k users sending 1 TX per day maximum 
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:53:05
Yes so we are in agreement that Bitcoin did not always have the hard block size limit of 1MB. It was set to 1MB for legitimate reasons at that time and now, years later, the environment around Bitcoin is substantially changed and conditions warrant a different block size limit.
My point being there should be as much pressure on those against Gavin's proposal to defend specifically why the 1MB limit is the proper limit opposed to 32MB, or "fill in the blank"MB. 
If Bitcoin is to be the "World Wide Ledger" then changing the block size limit is a reasonable debate to have in relation to scalability. Cryptocurrency is bigger than Bitcoin and lightweight more decentralized alternatives are available. 
Bitcoin nodes having higher maintenance costs will not inhibit the decentralization offered by the Cryptocurrency movement as a whole. Refusing to let Bitcoin grow will likely result in its role as the primary Cryptocurrency being overtaken by a technically superior alternative.
Also, "Regardless of how things were initially or got to where they are now; our utmost responsibility is to keep the system secure, valuable, and useful for ourselves and for those who come later." Are you implicitly stating that Gavin's proposal makes Bitcoin less secure or useful? If so you should state how that is the case. 
I agree that fees and capacity limits should be a part of the system as resources to support Bitcoin are finite. Storing data has a price. Supporting 1MB because thats the way its been for a while is not a convincing pitch for a community priding itself on innovation.
@_date: 2015-05-28 08:48:25
I agree. I hope to see more exchanges add XCP. Proof of Burn was wise, it is a proper use of incentive and I fear many of these pre-mine or vapor coins will face charges for issuing what may be considered an "unregistered security". 
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:12:24
Great post. This is our biggest test for scalability if we cannot increase block size from 1MB we need to consider what chain to migrate to. Looks like shills have won this debate. It is simply impossible to grow at this rate and develop global utility with a 1MB limit. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:50:13
I said reasonable argument. That response is a series of gibberish that does not address the direct questions asked to him. Bitcoin did not always have 1MB block size limit. It is not a design feature from Satoshi.
How can he justify defending the 1MB limit as the default option when it is not? That is the question asked of him. Especially considering the clear conflict of interest stemming from the 4 core devs who work for Blockstream. His reply was obfuscation it did not address the issues.
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:06:08
Appeal to authority does nothing for me. Appeal to authority is how we ended up with our current monetary system. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 04:06:35
We may get stuck at 1MB from community inertia, the chain will at some time in the future be severely backloaded, and we will effectively lose our first mover advantage in the cryptocurrency space. I initially thought the first mover advantage of Bitcoin would be enough but it seems Bitcoin will go the way of Myspace. This our "achilles heel" for scalability. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 07:23:31
True. Too little attention is being paid to the serious conflicts of interests from many of the core devs. Devs at Blockstream or devs involved with alt coins should be under increased scrutiny regarding their motives. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:39:00


That is the exact opposite of my argument. If we were bound to Bitcoin code from day 1 the 1MB limit would never exist. I also at one time supported implementation of the 1MB limit but conditions have changed. 


Do you think it would be better to propose a block size increase after we have become congested? Given even the most conservative projections for growth 1MB is an insufficient block size limit.
Bitcoin in its current form with 1 MB blocks, less than 5/1000th of 1% of our global population can make a single transaction on the blockchain each day with about 350k-500k max transactions per day. 
Not a "World Wide Ledger" by any stretch of the imagination. 


If not 1MB what is your alternative proposal? If you support 1MB indefinitely I am afraid we are not in broad agreement at all. 
Data storage and bandwidth will decrease in cost over time, especially with data monetization methods such as Storj. This trend is evident even over the short history of personal computing.
The marginal short term inconvenience and cost associated with a block size limit are far outweighed by the benefits of allowing Bitcoin to include more participants. 
If we scale and allow more participants in the Bitcoin network, we also create more candidates to host nodes, and the likely result of more holders from now with money to spend on nodes. Bitcoin is the ultimate bootstrapping tech. Same with mining cost to this point.
Or we should start to consider a method of node incentives to offset the cost of operating a full node. We have made great progress but we still have a lot of work to do as a community. 
Open source software needs improvements just like closed source software, the problem is open source software is more difficult to alter due to the need for broad consensus.

Gavin understands the severity of the issue he faces. I fully support Gavincoin and will be running BitcoinXT
