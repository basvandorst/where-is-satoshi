Isn't this kind of treatment of bitcoin counter intuitive to the whole point of it? As in treating it as a speculative commodity instead of an alt currency? 
All you are doing is duping fools into holding onto something that has no inherit value. You are doing yourselves a disservice.

I thought this was a currency, not a commodity.

I had 12 btc when it was like .20, lost the wallet, didn't and still don't mind although it would be nice for sure. I believe in crypto, but all you guys care about its price like it's a commodity instead of treating it as a currency. 
Every other thread is about the days btc price and whether you should jump from a building or make a virtuous post like some white knight. For sure crypto is the future, but the community should be more concerned about proliferation and keeping it deregulated. Before you know it the entire thing is going to be co-opted by the people this was meant to up-end. If not already...

You seem to have a disconnect. Comparing bitcoin to HTTP is incorrect. HTTP would be akin to Block Chain. Bitcoin would be more like a search engine, like Google or yesterday's Ask Jeeves.

This meme speaks well to the Bitcoin community... Just keep treating Bitcoin as a commodity instead of a currency, I'm sure if y'all hold long you will be millionaires one day. Maybe y'all can somehow restart the hype train and scam a couple more suckers into buying in before the next pump and dump.

You mean block chain, there is no garuntee bitcoin itself will be the future crypto standard.

This is when a discussion about how our tax dollars are used should happen.
