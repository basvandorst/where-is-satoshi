Barbarians are definitely not the type of people paying and collecting taxes, man.

"Compared to altcoins, Bitcoin’s sidechain/layer2 functionality has more community, competition, tech, people, capital, flexibility.
And it is here today."
This is an obvious lie. How can this get upvoted? Bitcon's layer2 functionality is demonstrably NOT "here today". There's what, 30 people on Lightning? With one of the main dev's warning people it's not ready for deployment yet?
Why the heck is it ok to bash altcoins here, when it's not ok to praise them? If one is not ok, the other shouldn't be either. Ban all altcoin discussion. This place can by design never be anything but a ridiculous echo chamber considering it's perfectly fine to say "this altcoin is shit" but even real, grounded arguments on why said coin is not will be banned as "altcoin shilling" (unless the mods are sleeping). It's not consistent.
I'm not going to name any coins but to me, the fact that there's cryptocurrencies that can do these things on the 1st layer is a big advantage. I don't want to do 2nd layer, ever. I want something simple and basic, like Bitcoin used to be a couple of years ago. 2nd layer is complicated. The "hot wallet" analogue isn't great in many ways. It's still costly every time you want to move funds into any 2nd layer. Topping up is also costly. There's many apparent issues with 2nd layer stuff and while Bitcoin's resiliency and age are definitely worthy of respect and nothing to be scoffed at, it's perfectly possibly that the technology is just fundamentally outdated compared to some of the newer coins, and that 2nd layer solutions isn't THE solution to all of our problems.

Um... the forum has been discussed here several times. is a moderator here and I'm assuming (I could be wrong) he got donations through here as well? And the idea is, again, assuming, to replace this forum with a new one? How is it not relevant? Maybe it's slightly meta, but so what? 
Edit: I was asked to motivate how it's relevant. I did. I'm downvoted. Huh?
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:17:51
I found a 6 year old discussion on this same topic: 
(which was also discussed here:  )
According to the OP, the cost per transaction was $4.20 back then. I can't really follow the discussions well because I'm not knowledgeable enough, but... for reference.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:19:05
Why did they do this? I followed all the rules in the sidebar. I thought people only got banned for promoting altcoins? Is anything that's not child porn smears of BCH actors or hodl!!! or "to the moon" memes "deceptive shilling of altcoins"?!

The data: 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:08:13
If you think so, please message the mods and ask them why they removed it as soon as it hit the front page.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:40:31
What are you defending yourself from?
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:17:20
So where should discussions about donations sent to the the top mod of the subreddit go, do you mean? It seems a moot point though, the moderators removed the post from the front page despite it not going against any of the rules in the sidebar.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:09:24
That's fine, but it gets a little ridiculous when claims people with English as a second language are more easily duped by the "simple narratives" from considering how is all about the "hodl"
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:59:23
Fine, you're entitled to think it's irrelevant. I disagree though and considering the post was 89% upvoted when it got yanked off the front page, I'd say the community at large seems to agree with me.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:07:21


Unlike the very complicated narratives spun on Are you serious? It's 90% memes.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:40:59
If you read the methodology you'd see it's not that kind of a survey. Survey = examination. I shouldn't have said "user survey" in the OP though, that made it a little ambiguous. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:14:43
Is this sub It's possible he's a "shill", but it's perfectly possible he isn't. Does it matter though? Don't shoot the messenger, engage with the message.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:18:45
I'm assuming he/they did for sure, at least partly, I mean that's why I didn't put "$50m+ in donations" in the title. 
There's this wallet which theymos quoted in another thread:
So actually the total amount might have been 11K BTC, not 6.9K (so around $83 million right now). What happened to the money? Has it all been spent/cashed in? How? If not, what's the plan for the remainder?
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:25:00
Is "wtf Vitalik defending CP?? O_O" a fair represenation of what Vitalik is saying?? If not, how can you claim it's not a smear?! Same thing with Falkvinge. How is it relevant? Anyone can see they are coming from a free speech philosophy on this and bringing it up here is just an attempt to get people to assume they're loonies.
I don't have an ideology and you are retarded for suggesting so. You must understand that you are turning people away from Bitcoin when you call everyone a shill and ask them to fuck off? Even if we assume there's a 5/50/95% chance I am a shill, what about the 95%/50/5% chance that I'm just an actual newbie?
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:32:15
Is the buy/sell gap smaller? By how much?
Edit: 899150 vs 897000 right now here: 
Is that it? Are there any other costs suddenly appearing when you try and finish the transaction? Why the heck is bitflyer so much more expensive??
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:56:55


I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow. Are you saying you arrived at the cost per transaction is $7, not $20+? What are your assumptions then (I mean, I showed the sources for mine)? What do you mean by "one tx pays 44USD"? You mean that's what the miners earn?
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:28:50
It's probably more expensive as that's only the electricity cost, which doesn't include hardware costs and, you know, all other costs the miners might have. Not to mention not all miners will be enjoying industrial electricity prices. The average cost in the US outside of industrial use is something like 12 c/kW.
But either way a $20 cost per transaction does seem to mean Bitcoin, or indeed any PoW-based cryptocurrency, isn't really suited to small transactions at all, at least not on a large (mainstream, i.e. non-hobbyist) scale? Or am I misunderstanding things?
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:44:45
A bit late but OP is wrong, or is at least using the wrong terminology - it's categorized as "miscellaneous income" (雑所得) under income tax (所得税). Which makes perfect sense to me? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:51:56
I saw that too, but I'm not sure what that really means after 6 years of development and no announcements and the value of the donated BTC skyrocketing in the meanwhile (6900 BTC = roughly USD45 million, not to mention maybe an additional $7 million right now in BCH). I feel like that IF any of the money donated is still sitting unused (e.g. not paid to the developrs), it should be returned to the people who donated it.... because seriously, ethically/legally how could you justify earning a private fortune off of donations?!

Hypothesis: Despite the extreme polarization between and with everything from child porn smears to namecalling and unfounded accusations frequently getting highly upvoted, I believe that both communities 1) hold valid opinions and are not 'just' consisting of paid shills, 2) were once the same community but essentially forced apart by excessive moderation/censorship on part of the mods in One way of proving the validity of this hypothesis would be to look at what the userbase used to look like before things got this bad. If either community consisted mainly of "paid shills" and "clueless newbies", you wouldn't expect to see many, or hardly any, of the "old-timers" posting in that subreddit. 
Method: I opened up archive.org's Wayback machine and travelled 4 years back in the past. 4 years is an arbitrary date. I wanted to go as far back as possible but still get usable data. I meant to do a "5 years ago on this day" thing but there was no archive at all for November in 2012. I opened up the five top posts and recorded the user names who had written comments with at least 10 upvotes/points. That limit, too, is pretty arbitrary, but I figured it was an OK attempt at filtering out low-effort spam, etc. I ended up with 98 usernames, which I went through manually and recorded where they had posted in the past year, within 3 pages of their posts/comments on their profile page (i.e. "overview"). For users who've switched to the new profile system, I went through the "comments" tab instead of the "overview" (because the overview page confuses me). This could of course have been done more effectively and precisely with a bot, but that's beyond what I can do.
As a sidenote, I wish I had also recorded what other cryptocurrency subs people were posting in, but I came up with this idea too late to bother. (and related subs) was the most popular, with maybe 5 or so users posting there. Which makes perfect sense of course, as it's currently the second largest crypto in terms of market cap. Other coins I saw flash by were vertcoin and burstcoin.
Out of the 31 accounts who are still active and have posted in either or in the past year/past 3 pages of activity, 
* 58% were active on * 77% were active (Subsequently,)
* 23% were active exlusively on * 42% were active exclusively on What was once one community is now two. This small survey doesn't answer what the influx of new users might be like, and mere "activity" in one subreddit does of course not necessarily speak to whether you support that sub or not. But it seems obvious that either community CAN NOT consist of just paid shills. Small-blockers and big-blockers, BTC and BCH proponents both deserve respect and not smears. Even if you vehemently disagree with Roger Ver/Jihan Wu or Adam Back/theymos and believe they are horrible people, which fine, you're free to believe, that doesn't mean that everybody who holds the same views as them are mere puppets echoing the believes of their "leaders."

I'm an "outsider" or whatever to the bitcoin communities but I've seen highly upvoted child porn smears here not once but twice against people who have said something positive about Bitcoin Cash (previously it was against Rick Falkvinge). This community is toxic as fuck and if it's representative of the Bitcoin Core supporters, and if this subreddit is actually endorsed/controlled by the Core team(?), I sincerely hope any other coin becomes the next "Bitcoin".

It's been 2 minutes, and I'm already downvoted? Why? This hasn't (seemingly) been discussed here in over a year. would you care to update the community? (you have no obligation towards me of course but probably to everybody else)
Edit: downvoted to oblivion within minutes. Asked "how is this relevant" when the post concerns the development of a separate forum by the **top mod** of this very sub, a forum that has been seriously questioned and accused of suspicious mishandling of the funds [right here on Meanwhile child porn smears of people who have talked of BCH approvingly on twitter are highly upvoted ergo deemed relevant to the community? CHrist. Are there any less shitty places to discuss bitcoin than Are you as a community seriously satisfied this?
Edit2: OK, "downvoted to oblivion" apparently came a little too soon, sorry, flew off the handle a little maybe, the post was at 20% upvoted and I assumed that was it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:22:47
There's legal implications to receiving donations though. Not to mention ethical ones. If (again, if) became a multi-millionaire through coins donated to him for a specific project, one he still hasn't delivered on, one he (AFAICT) doesn't bother updating the community on, would that strike you as A-OK?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:46:45
The mods themselves have posted right here on the development of this forum, in recent memory.
Your analogy is flawed. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:55:38
No, it was indeed removed. I talked to the mods who said they were "not inclined to approve it" after it "got stuck in the spam filter" because they suspected vote manipulation/ban evasion + "drama instigation" + "not relevant". Seems one of them nonetheless decided to unblock it 17 hours after first removing it... some 16 hours after they talked to me about it. In the meanwhile of course, the submission has gone from the the top spot on the front page to the bottom of page 3. 
I'm impressed you found your way here. Nobody else has, though.
Edit: thanks for the downvotes!?
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:02:50
A-hah. I didn't check the digiconomist page too closely when I posted but I see now it mentions "Note that the Index contains the aggregate of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash", so that's probably where the discrepancy is from.
