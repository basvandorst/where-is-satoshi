If you think you can game with the IRS  when it comes to things like this, they are ready to ball when you are. Cryptocurrencies are really secure until someone is threatened with jail time, or being beaten with a hose. It is amazing how fast you lose anonymity when the state starts offering leniency for cooperation.

Just when bitcoin transactions couldent take long enough to wait for confirmations, lets add a new third party service that you have to trust to not run off with your money to delay it even further!
I can buy gas in about 5 seconds with a credit card, and if you fuck around with my money i can call the cc company and get my money back. Explain how waiting 2 hours for gas to confirm transactions and complete escrow is not a hopeless joke of a currency. (not to mention how inherently crippling the deflation would be)

How often do you think people getting audited think bullshit like that is going to get them out of trouble? You are either lying about the transaction, or dodging capital gains. If you are not paying the fair market value in USD when it comes to the taxes on a vehicle sale, you are committing a crime. Even if you steal the car you have to report the value of it, in USD at the time of theft, to not be committing tax avoidance.

You should take out payday loans to really cash in on how much money bitcoins are going to make you. Maybe you should mortgage your house as well! Its such a surefire way to make free money how could you afford not to?
(you are about to be penniless)

The media covered how hot beanie babies were getting for a while too. There was a week where a tickle me elmo was hundreds of dollars more valuable than its MSRP. All bubbles burst, all unsustainable trends end.
