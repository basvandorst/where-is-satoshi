I just don't circlejerk over it. It's a currency. You don't need to revolve your life around it. It will take time to be implemented into more things, and you don't have to obsess over every single human being that gets involved and has the same generic shitty story to tell about how they have bitcoin now and "are excited". It makes it seem so much less credible when everyone circlejerks around such stupid sensationalism. 
Have you been to Bitcoin Center in New York? It's a joke. What they talk about it a complete joke. People act as though Bitcoin is just seconds away from replacing everything, and it's just fucking stupid. I think it's a great way to diversify, but obsessing over it as if it's some end-all-be-all currency is just ridiculous and it makes it harder for it to be taken seriously in general (and in the end, will probably be the cause of some other crypto becoming more mainstream)
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:36:46
I didn't need to be told that. It's a currency. You know, [rice was once a currency]( Do I need to teach you what a currency is? Please don't make me teach you the definition of currency. This is a fundamental paradigm shit and those that know do not need to be told. You. Fucking. Dumb. Ass.

I love this subreddit. "Study shows majority of US citizens unlikely to purchase or use Bitcoin in any way" **Downvoted**
"HEY LOOK GUYS, ANOTHER BITCOIN MACHINE! HEY LOOK GUYS, A PLACE THAT ACCEPTS BITCOIN" **To the front page with you**
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:46:13
This is actually good news!
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:32:10
Want me to link all of the ridiculous posts?
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:45:33
And if a glitch in the software of a particular bitcoin wallet accidently caused it to push twice?

"I know you guys complain about things, and ordinarily I wouldn't care, but today it happened to me, so now I'm complaining about it."
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:05:45
I was wondering why people were complaining about such a low transaction rate on Black Friday. Bitcoin is most likely going to be used for internet purchases and people like myself were waiting for Cyber Monday.
[I've been wanting to get into photography for a while and it seemed like a good day to make a purchase for that]( It was an extra 5% off with the Gyft cyber Monday deal :D

~~I was double charged by my~~ local shwarma restaurant that accepts bitcoin. The guy was nice enough to remember me and gave me my meal for free the next time I came in. New tech leads to problems. At least Bank of America returned the money. If it were double charging bitcoin, there would be no bank to return anything.
Oh god, I'm going to get so much hate for stating this here.
*edit*: instead of replying to everyone, I wasn't double charged, but I accidentally double spent
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:43:06
What do you think about Bitcoin simply being surpassed by another crypto and a wave of people moving to that new crypto, say, one created by Google or Facebook?
@_date: 2014-10-22 18:24:19
If this were true, wouldn't it be obvious to them that their employee was doing this AMA? You're just trolling now, lol
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:35:09
This sub is also pretty circle-jerky and reposty, so you also just get a lot of general negativity at the fact that it's not a very high quality community in general, though there are some gems in the coal-mines which is why I check back sometimes.
Like, I kind of can't believe the number one post as I type this is just another post about the pizza someone bought years ago that is now worth so much money. That has been on the front page hundreds of times, yet here it is, still the  post of the day. Yesterdays  post is the same picture that's been on the front page dozens of times of the jet with the Bitcoin logo on it. It's a little silly to assume all negativity is related to a conspiracy, though some of it is.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:53:25
It's just wasted here anyway.
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:32:49
Don't you mean "uses capital letters *in the wild*"?
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:08:38
I have a few accounts. I made this one because I wanted one to represent where I live. I've been a redditor for 7 years, buddy. And I've been using Bitcoin for 3. The guy told me that it didn't go through and there was a line so I just scanned it again thinking I must have missed it the first time. It was an honest mistake. There was no way for him to easily return it back to me so he said he'll remember me and give me a free meal last time. It wasn't a big deal.
The point is, you guys act like Bitcoin is the end-all-be-all of everything, and simply put, it isn't. I'm invested in bitcoin, I just think the ridiculous sensationalism you guys try to pull off of acting like everything sucks but bitcoin is laughable and it makes it hard for anyone to take you seriously.
The fact that you guys attack the character of anyone who even remotely questions the bitcoin system shows that even serious problems with the currency would be completely overlooked here and none of your opinions should matter in the eyes of anyone who's trying to figure out whether or not they should get involved.
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:45:22
I'd expect people to get sick of upvoting "We accept Bitcoin" and Bitcoin machines to the front page every day after a few years.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:56:26
I've made good money on BTCJam, but I've had one investment (which, looking back, I was stupid to invest in, but I was new) that defaulted. I received no information, I don't know what happened to it. Do they actually sell it to a crediting agency, and if so, I take it the actual investors don't get any of that money, right?
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:58:17
Yeah, after that statement. As I said it, it was in the negatives.

Not sure then. I know there's a faucet bitcoin subreddit but I don't remember what it is. If you can find it, maybe they can help you.

At least there it's somewhat satirical.

I was hoping overstock would do a cyber monday bitcoin deal this year and was waiting for that, but I don't think it's going to happen :-/

@_date: 2014-10-22 14:13:37
Same with this subreddit.
@_date: 2014-12-01 00:08:58
I was just wondering if like overstock was having a special sale for bitcoin only or anything. That would have been so great for the market.
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:02:04
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:23:28
That could be from any number of things. It's not the most stable market in the world.
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:45:00
Overstock.com is 10% off everything right now
Also, lots of online stores are having cyber Monday, including Amazon (just not on the item I wanted, but it had a great prime discount). Tigerdirect (also accepts bitcoin) has lots of cyber Monday items for sale. 
The reason, I think, that companies don't do a bitcoin only cyber Monday combo sale is that it would make their already discounted items even more discounted and it would probably cause a big spike in the market only to fall the very next day (just speculating)
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:01:53
I said "It's a currency" and you made it out like what I said was wrong. I didn't say it's just a currency. I'm not wasting more time talking to you. Clearly we disagree on how ridiculous this subreddit is.

I think he was genuinely interested. Not everyone is negative for the sake of trolling. Some people are simply being logical and negativity shouldn't always be downvoted IMO. My biggest problem with this subreddit is that it's way too positive to be of any actual use for anyone who wants good information.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:57:06
You got it! .03 bits
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:38:09
The joke is definitely on you.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:36:54
True. I figured I'll wait until a week or two from now when people aren't so close to pay-day and see what's happening. For the most part, I'm loving the price drop since I'm invested on BTCJam for USD-tied loans
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:21:01
Most "leading bitcoiners", at least on this subreddit, are actually retarded.

@_date: 2015-01-15 19:30:50
Not really a waste of my time. I posted good info and I got someone potentially interested in the website. Your account is a month old and you only post typical shit that's just obnoxious and not needed here. I'm going to stop wasting my time now and let you finish this up with something that makes you feel better.

You realize Bitcoin in Bitstamp are safe, right?
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:01:03
Not really. Gox was giving the most minimal of information while Bitstamp is giving multiple updates of what to be careful for, what's safe, and what isn't. Gox was a clusterfuck of obvious conning.
@_date: 2015-01-25 08:10:46
The Bitcoin community is a pretty awful one and, sorry guys, I feel like it's smart of them to make this move. Circle has plans to be a better version of paypal and I applaud them for it. They offer a Bitcoin exchange, but their main purpose is the transfer of wealth without hidden fees. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:51:05
They've submitted so much information...What are you talking about? Numerous messages saying exactly what's happening, what we should and shouldn't do, and what we do and don't have to worry about.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:50:06
It depends how you want to play the market. If you invest in a loan tied to the USD, you not only get the interest on your loan, but if the value of Bitcoin drops, you get back every penny of that drop as well in the form of Bitcoin.
So, let's say you invest one Bitcoin in someone when it's worth $200  interest (one-time payment to keep it simple). If it pays out 30 days later and Bitcoin is now worth $100, you will get 2.1 Bitcoin back. 
Keep in mind that if it goes the other way around, investing 1btc at $100  interest, rises to $200, you would get .5025 Bitcoin back.
When I'm not sure what's going to happen to the market, I do not invest in USD-tied loans. When I'm sure the market will keep dropping, I do. You just need to know what you're doing. At first, I recommend playing with small amounts at a time and sticking to short-term loans.
There's also the factor of how much you think you can trust someone. To start, I recommend only investing in people in your own country who use their actual names and have meticulous information about what they will be doing with the money. **Do not invest in people who are just going to reinvest it back into BTCJam.** 
@_date: 2014-10-23 01:25:07
Figured that would be some form of a response. Just funny. This subreddit and all of bitcoin is such a fucking joke with a fanbase filled with people like yourself. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 06:37:20
Buttercoin wasn't anything special. Their services didn't show much originality or bring much to the table that other exchanges don't already have.
Also, the fact that they're sending an email 5 days before people need to withdraw their funds is downright unprofessional and ludicrous. What, so they're just going to keep everything otherwise? 
Blaming their lack of investments on the "dip in bitcoin interest among Silicon Valley investors" insults the community and ignores the fact that they, themselves, might not have been a great investment, and this email exemplifies that.

Get out of here with that logic. We're too busy willfully being ignorant to care about such nonsense. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:57:35
Every time there is a price change there is a new gif or meme about it on here. Every day there is someone on the front page explaining why they're investing it all, and everyday there is someone saying why they're done with it.
The community here is no better than the mainstream media's take on it. Both are sensationalistic for their own reasons.
