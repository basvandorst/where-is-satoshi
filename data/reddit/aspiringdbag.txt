It's amazing that people here plug their ears and scream when it's their own money that's at stake. This place is a damn cult.

I think all the institutional money entering the game is going to start opening a lot of shorts soon. Also think there's a good chance of a Tether collapse, as they haven't actually proved that their assets are fully backed. If that happens it's gonna get really ugly.
No specifics here but I have a feeling a bloodbath is around the corner. Of course, I could be waiting a very long time for that.

That right there is plenty enough to reverse things into a bearish market, especially since the price has been going through the roof the past few months. It doesn't have to directly affect everything for it to cause a market-wide panic. 
Additionally... Most people here seem to think that all the new hands entering the game are a good thing for bitcoin's price prospects. I disagree. We have a bunch of new folks entering who think that the price will just go up forever, who have never seen the uglier side of crypto. I find it hard to believe these new entrants won't just immediately dump their newly-bought BTC at the first sign of a reversal. But of course, this is all just speculation. I guess I'm just a bit more risk-averse than a lot of people here. I won't feel comfortable holding until after this bubble bursts, if it does.

Dude just look at the mempool. 100k unconfirmed transactions and fees skyrocketing. Pick a transaction, any transaction...

You think, after quintupling in the past 6 months, bitcoin will increase another 7-8x in value before the next crash? You have a much rosier view of the crypto market than I do

Take a look at the unconfirmed transactions and average fees. It wasn't amazing before but its god awful now. That isn't FUD, just a fact
Edit: and before anybody calls me a shill... I've never even posted in the other sub. I just am amazed that people think the current backlog and fees are remotely acceptable

[Article here explains it better than I can.](
There was a Tether hack recently, a loss of just $30 million (imo a pretty small amount of money) caused a pretty large selloff. Basically, my reasoning is that with prices being incredibly high, people are not going to need a lot of reasons to sell. It's been a while since we've had a big tank... my fingers are crossed as I've currently cashed out

Altcoins are primarily denominated in BTC rather than USD. Because of this people tend to switch from alts to BTC when bitcoin is going on a run, and back to alts when they feel the run is over 
Right now, alts have been getting killed for some time, now they are pushing back

Ethereum is way better for this purpose. Costs pennies to send, if that 
Edit: downvoting doesn't make this not true folks

That's a great point. Any idea how long it is until that happens?

He doesn't wonder, just mindlessly buys. "It's free money" lol. Bitcoin is completely fucked, it was allowed to stagnate too long and ETH will take the reigns once this crash bottoms out. Feel free to ban me for the truth mods.
