doesn't coinbase insure all accounts that are in the exchange aka your portfolio and not in cold storage? I know that 98-99% of their btc are in cold storage, but I am 99% sure they are fully insured in case they get a massive hack like Mt.Gox.... The only way it would not be insured is if someone hacked just your account... is this accurate?

I thought If your bitcoins were on Coinbase.com in your portfolio they were insured.... Is this not true?

yeah the vault = cold storage though.... I am strictly talking about money you keep in your portfolio on their exchange.

80% of 150 people that's like a huge sample size... this is obviously legit.

you can't bluff someone with a royal flush.... also turning pocket Kings or Aces into a bluff is usually not optimal and are best to play as check call hands on bad board textures... otherwise you're mainly betting for value here :)
