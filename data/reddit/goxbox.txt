my impression from him running away with them is that he was at least aiding and knew what was going on. It sounds like many kids were taken advantage of in pretty graphic, drugged,and disgusting ways. Most information in regard to these cases have been taken off the internet. He's paid his name clean.
It also appears he also defrauded IGE business partners. Just what MTGox needs as a investor and operator.
I am not saying he is guilty of these crimes but the legal system has a way of enabling money to protect criminals. His character has been devalued from his continued interactions with those people and whatever role his lawyers are keeping secret.

The name is really damn funny but theyve been around longer than bitcoin has existed and they are a solid group.
[That said let me Google something for you](
i trust him as far as I can toss the ol' bugger and I can't throw him far
edit: i think hes getting articles taken down too because im pretty sure there used to be a lot more
edit2: [yep - check out the editor's notes]( this is a different care but shows his lawyer watchdogs presence.
