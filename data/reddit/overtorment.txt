Very interesting, gj. Why do you think they are manipulating the price downward instead of up?
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:45:31
Looks like blockchain is not synced fully, and the node does not know about transactions referenced in inputs (yet). Solution: wait for the full sync

Arbitragers do this all the time and in huge volumes. Thats the reason price difference doesnt grow even more. Any difference you see is only because at this rates fees will eat any profit gained from arbitrage.

Probably your balance consists of many small transactions to your address (many UTXO - transaction outs). So new transaction you're trying to create (which utilizes UTXOs) is pretty heavy in byte size.

It's not deterministic, there's no consensus on that, its completely up to a specific node (i.e. miner)
Yes, to confirm faster you can: 1) do Replace-by-fee 2) do Child-pay-for-parent
To answer your original question, this might be: 1) spam 2) test transactions (I used to test my own btc payment gateway with zero fee txs)  3) txs from people who are really not in a hurry

Good points. To formulate it shorter, id say that bitcoin price trend is  a positive feedback loop, supporting the direction of the trend (the higher the price - the less btc needs to be sold, driving price up, and vice versa). As for halving. I was watching last halving really closely, and nothing happened to the price druring the halving.

+1. The whole point of paper wallet is that private key never reaches any PC (which might be potentially infected). So transfering to new paper wallet is a good idea in terms of security, but if you are really sure you are not infected/backdoored/hacked, you can skip that.

@_date: 2017-10-12 19:07:55
I suggest you do what cex.io says. Becase accepting credit cards is a huge risk for any bitcoin business. If you pay with stolen credit card and withdraw bitcoins, owner of the card can do a chargeback. But bitcons cant be brought back.
Also, for any significant deposit amount _every_  exchange wil ask you to pass verification.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:09:54

Youre missing a point. High fees is a protection against spam transactions. Every time I witnessed the average fee go down,  some kind of spammer appears and spends tens of thousands of usd to “test” the network. Have you ever heard of dust transactions? 
As for confirmation time. Well, compared to traditional credit cards, where final settlement can be up to 3 months, btc grants irreversibility after ~10 minutes.

Step 1. Move all legit bitcoins (from legit chain) to other really safe wallet. Now when they are in a safe place, you only have BCH and BCG on your key.
Step 2. Get a wallet that supports bitcoin cash (bch website is the best source of info; I heard you can use electrum-cash, but I personally used pre-release version of coinb.in)
Step 3. Import key. Send BCH to an exchange. Sell.

This problem was discussed many times. Some think that "black" coins (from illegal activities) wont be accepted by parties. 
But eventually, all of the coins will turn "grey" (mixed with "black" coins), so nobody will block them, and they will be accepted.
PS. I borrowed this opinion, I dont remember where I read it but I agree with it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:56:20
It might be that block explorer "forgotten" the unconfirmed transaction (because it is unconfirmed and old), so the id wont help. It woud be best if you coud fetch the whole tx body from the wallet somehow.

Just a guess.
If support is busy, that might take a week or two till they get to your ticket, find anonymous bank transaction, verify it and credit your account.
In case they automatically reject and send back anonymous transactions, that might take couple of banking days (god I hate banks), and here it depends on how bad/slow your bank will handle that.

No. Removing 1 bit - thats twice easy.
That would be a major degradation.
"The English-language wordlist for the BIP39 standard has 2048 words, if the phrase has 12 words then the number of possible combinations is 2048^12 = 2^132, so this phrase would have 132 bits of security."
Source: 
Removing half of words would be only 66 bits of security, which is 2^66 combinations.
Which is still a lot (~ 1 and 19 zeroes combinations)

Easy way to determine what you'vegot:
* How many symbols  your code has? If around 50 - looks like its a private key in WIF format.
* If its around 60 characters - thats a private key in regular format.
* Does it start with "1" and have length around 30 characters? Looks like an address. You're f*cked (if you wont find your priate key)
Convert private key to address and check your balance. I usually use

1) Might be wrong but.... Once you got randomness, you can apply certain mathematical operations to it and it slill gona be random, so no need to gather entropy again, just do some twist to it.
2) Write private key, preferably both in WIF and regular format just for any case. Address is not important (only for deposit).  I made myself a tool to generate cold text wallets 
3) I would install virtualBox and do a fast Linux install, generate my keys and destroy it. Should be safer than your host operating system.
4) I dont use Conibase, but I guess not.
