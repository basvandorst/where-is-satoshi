I already have a hw.1 wallet where half of my Bitcoin are strored on. I'm now looking at a safe option for the other half and would like a different solution so that if one fails I at least still have half of my coins. Another Ledger hardware wallet could be an option.

Although they received more then the 120.000 € they were asking for, GnuPG still is a very worth wile cause. They don't accept Bitcoin on their own website, but you can donate to them via Wau Holland Foundation:

Another privacy centric good cause is Riseup:  
They provide e-mail, mailing lists, VPN and more to activists.

I haven't done Android dev yet and don't have an Android device right now, so can't help you. Also, .02 BTC is very little, at what I consider a normal hourly rate, you could get about 18 minutes of development for that. Definitely not enough for an app, no mater how simple.
