LAST OFFER, FIVE GORILLION DOLLARS PER COIN

Precisely. The skyrocketing price is also the only reason I'm interested in it. The conversion rate to EUR/USD is what interests me, not BTC itself.

That's something entirely different.

A $10 dip isn't a crash.

This applies to everyone posting here, not just him. Everyone's giving investing "advice" to everyone except themselves.

I too am willing to watch people sacrifice their Bitcoins for the sake of my own.

Past performance is not indicative of future trends. Someone might expose a massive flaw tomorrow and you'd be left with a bunch of $0.001 magic beans on the internet.

Not sure how you reached that point...

Let's not get all hyperbolic about it...

Gold looks nice and is shiny. You can make nice looking things with it. People have always wanted nice looking things, and this is something that will never change.

Of course you love it since you started using it right as it started its insane growth. If you had posted this same thing last year, I would have believed you when you said this is an "awesome, open currency." Right now, though, I think you're just excited that it's making you heavy $. Which isn't a bad thing, and I'm not saying it's not an exciting currency, but your post feels a little forced by circumstance. It's like telling a woman you love her while sexing her up.

Ah, yes. I can already see the recyclers of the slums of Mumbai rushing to buy bitcoins on their smartphones and educating themselves about the ecosystem.
