Yes I want a stamp like that for btc.

Dont get to excited. We will be going down and then sideways for a little bit.

Ethereum is a valid blockchain that strongly complements bitcoin.

Technological use case = use in electronics 
What the correction?

Has any actually retrieved anyfunds?
If they did not take the coins it really is not hacked. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:14:13
Excellent point. The currency part of bitcoin only becomes  efficient at mass adoption. Volatility will be nominal.
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:01:03
It depends on the individuals risk profile. 
Risk profiles are fluid.

CBoE futures are not settled in BTC!

Cost of mining is a strong support.

You complain about bitcoin to much. I think the issue is with the OP not BTC.

No. Nodes have nothing to do with adoption.
Not every adopter will run a node.
Some adopters are going to run one node.
Some adopters are going to run multiple nodes.
Commercial entities will run nodes. Governments will run nodes.
I think the decisions on whether to run a node depends upon how invested you are in that chain.
An individual in Zimbabwe using bitcoin or bcash to buy food and pay rent has limited risk and as such the cost of running a node is not worth it.
An individual in Cape Town running an bitcoin &amp; bcash exchange has a lot of risk and will likely be running multiple nodes for each chain because the cost is so low.
An individual in Canada using bitcoin as a currency has some risk and may or may not run a bitcoin node or two. The small cost is worth it but people are lazy. 
A Roger Ver shilling bcash to third world countries pays to run thousands of bcash nodes because the risk of losing control of his pet project is ever present in his head.
Running a node is specifically dependent upon the individuals profile.

I think you are very confused how Bitcoin appreciation works.
It lost is value because uneducated speculation drove the price higher than could be supported. 
From you other comments it seems you bought at the wrong time for the wrong reason. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:23:49
On the American futures you dont need to borrow HTC because the contract is settled in USD not btc.
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:47:07
Any Futures anything ETF or not which is not physically settled in bitcoin is just the elites attempt to destroy bitcoin. 
They are intentionally setting up a layer upon layer of finacial pressure on Bitcoin without creating demand on the actual asset. This will result in a collapse if enough pressure is created.
Idiots think they can stop BTC. Haha. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:39:28
Dude you are a troll. We all can read your comment history.
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:58:08
I think your missing the point. The people that can't afford to run a node do not have enough invested in the economy to make running a node even worth it.
Running a node is a security for the assets you have in the economy. As such the more Bitcoin you have the more advantageous it is to run  node(s).
If you don have a lot of bitcoin the risk to you is limited.

Thanks for posting. Well worth it.

So sick of morons trying to convince me xxx coin is going to be the top coin becuase bitcoin is like my space.
My grim response is always: "One coin to rule them all."

A quick runup to 20k  contains a lot of momentum that does not cease in a matter of weeks.
Bear market momentum is slowing. After it ends we will trade sideways until a major catalyst pushes us to a higher or lower support.
Track your support levels and watch it bounce for a few more months. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:29:49
If you are down 60% in bitcoin you clearly did not understand the investment prior to investing.
You care a lot about bitcoin to be so bearish on it. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:58:39
Mass adoption can't occur until the software can support it. Bitcoin economics intentionall set up this way. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:31:41
If any body has any extra of the not real but worth more bitcoin....
It would be great to buy a big billboard close to Rogers office for trolling purposes.

Good post. Bitcoin is not Digital Gold. People say this to help people understand a part of its investment utility. 
Due to their investment nature both gold and bitcoin are not correlated to the traditional Stock markets and currencies. People think of them as safe haven assets for bad economic conditions.
What makes gold valuable? Gold is valued becuase of the social construct. We used gold as money long before any true technological valuable use case. The use of gold as money had such a strong impact on social society that people still use it as a hedge against the current monetary system. The hedge works becuase of peoples group psychology. The largest demand for gold is psychological not technical.
What makes bitcoin better than gold?
Bitcoin is more finite than gold. Bitcoin is more durable than gold. Bitcoin is more divisible than gold.  Bitcoin more transportable than gold. Bitcoin is cheaper to secure than gold. Bitcoin cannot be adulterded, gold is constantly adultered. Most importantly we are at the pinprick of the iceberg for bitcoins use cases.
Gold's future demand will primarily be driven by technological demand as psychological demand wanes due to bitcoin. This wane will be noticeable as generation turnover occurs.

Authorities will be calling you if you start dumping large amounts.
Banks will also be unpleasant if you can't provide details of acquisition.
Be careful and hire an attorney if necessary.

I think you are creating a problem where none exists. Please explaine the issue with the current block size.

You do realize bitcoin is not even to version 1 yet.

I think you truely hate btc becuase you sold it all for BCash.

You are the only one having "issues"
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:46:09
So true.
They will not give up and they will go to drastic measures to try to fuck the revolution. But as many have said the Bitcoin white paper was the opening of pandoras box. You can't stop it.
We will lose battles and have Bitcoin depressions. However, the strength of the network is always growing. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 04:44:12
It is when you are going around saying you hate an investment. 
Why are you so attached? 
Did you not make a plan before investing?
Did you not follow that plan?
Did you not learn how bull/bear markets work in Bitcoin?
The way you are acting suggests you are new and upset because you lost money. You are now so emotional you are trying to convince others to take your investment advice without knowing anything about their financial situation.
I'm sorry you got hurt.

 Bitcoin's energy consumption is nominal compared to Amazon, google, FB, casinos, amusement parks, trains, planes, cruise ships, etc.
The narrative that bitcoin's energy consumption is a concern is poorly researched or propaganda.
If people have issue with Bitcoins energy consumption due to environmental concerns they should focus on attacking the things they love that consume more energy like Facebook. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 17:41:34
It is a psychological support.

No 50k this year in my crystal ball.
I did speak with Trelawney last week.
Our most optimistic outlook has Bitcoin bottoming in September 2018. A slow bull market taking hold in October 2018. This bull will continue bouncing off the $20k resistance in May 2019. The resistance will result in a shallow retreat before the largest bull run in Bitcoin history takes place winter 2019/20.

@_date: 2018-08-24 15:26:38
Many of the new people have yet to finish their homework. They dont understand why the Distributed Ledger Technology Satoshi invented is so relevant.
They dont know or dont understand Satoshi's end game...
Satoshi stays hidden becuase he set off Bitcoin which will ultimately cause the central banking financial system to collapse.
When the central banking financial system collapses, many governments will also be replaced. Many powerful people are at risk of losing more than just money. Bitcoin strips them of their power to manipulate money.

Bisq does not believe in the value of altcoins. They only use them to make money. All capital requirements are in BTC to secure their interest against your poor trades.
