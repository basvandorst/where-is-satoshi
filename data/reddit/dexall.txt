Bitcoin was rising for the different news, hardforks and rumours of a CME listing. We all knew it was over valued when it went over 10k, but it just kept going. Personally I thought it would max out at 3k lol lucky i'm a hodler haha. But when the news hit, there was nothing to sustain the price, so all the shorts kicked in. These markets can only maintain price increases with a strong rumour, if there is nothing there, pop, down it goes. People say the CME is suppressing the price like other commodities, sure they can try, but the btc market cap would have to be a lot bigger for them to manipulate. At the moment, they are just playing the game like the rest of us.

The market is just correcting, it could be a month or 2 years. The aim of the game is to get more btc before 2020s block halving. Be prepared for it to go lower, u need a strong gut for this, but it becomes easier if you consider the money lost. I just sling mine in poloniex and loan out, make the money work for you. Good luck, I'm sure you will make the right decision. Flip it on a coin if you can't decide, I know one gets an upgrade in the next 3 weeks or so.

2009 there was one owner, now there is 750,000. Why would anyone jump into a system, ask the 749,000. I'm not for or against, but I do own a portion as I do gold, silver, porn, and a guitar:)

I think what he is getting at, is the fact that Putin thinks America has something to do with bitcoin. Putin knows the NSA wrote a paper in 1996 describing a cryptographic mint. There has been a currency war going on, and everyone is paranoid.

Will probably work like Ripple xrp, gateways and all that crap. I can understand gateways are quick access to things like gold. But to use them to exchange into other currencies will sooner or later fizzle out, as there will be no need. Thats is, if bitcoin lives up to the hype.

Do what you need to do to secure the traders funds Mr Poloniex. But I do believe it would be in your best interests to address the frustrated traders by giving an explanation as to what is going on. PS I hope Polo pulls through this, because it is an awesome exchange when it is working:)

Lets hope so. But I can see we will trap ourselves. Its just the question, How does it end? I heard that the Ethereum team had hired some Philosophers, if true. Would they question not the same?

1 btc is pegged to transfer the wealth of 1million dollars, the other pegged to transfer 1thousand dollars. I want to buy a toaster, how much will it cost me? Colouring a coin could lead to tainted coins, ie stolen, which in turn, would make the btc worthless. I see where you come from, and it is quite a nice idea, I think Ripple do it.

When I was a kid a mars bar cost 25p now they are worth 60p. If they didnt go mouldy, I'd probably have a boner over them too. Interest is lower than inflation. The longer you hold cash in the bank, the more it is worth less. Yes, banks provide a service and should be paid for what they do. But bad practice will eventually catch up with them as it has done so many times, and the only people who will pay for it will be the tax payer. I'm pro bitcoin, yes, because I have a lot invested, the same as I'm pro 3d printing and other crap.

Thought you were going to hand my ass on a plate lol. I'm glad you'r a reasonable person. The truth is, at this moment in time, no one knows what btc is. Is it a transfer of wealth, or is it a store of value. I've always looked at it as a pure 1 to 1 concept, this is what I meant by fare trade. 1 btc in Africa is the same as 1 btc in France. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:55:38

I think the Trezor uses a Seed. So even if it did die, you could just buy another Trezor, import the Seed and retrieve you'r loot. I think this is how it works.

Get this. One month I was really really skint (had no money). On the day of getting paid, I had a phone call from my bank informing me that someone in america was trying to make a withdrawal from my account, mind you I'm in the uk. To my saddened state the bank informed me that it would take up to 7 days for them to send me new details. 7 days without money is a fucking BITCH. I'm not pointing any fingers (ADOBE) but you'r the one that had my details, and you were the one that got hacked. Thanks for having my account closed down for 7 days!

I always blag my family about btc, and they turn around and say 'Its rude to talk about money'. If this mentality is in most people heads, then they will find it hard to wake up to the fact that their banks are robbing them blind. People see the prices of things go up, but it doesn't occur to them that it's their money going down. Put your money in Gold, will lead for them to mine more, making yours worth less. There is nothing out there apart from Crypto currencies that could have the potential to be a store of value. Maths is king (lets hope so)

If you have your coins stored on paper before the event of a split, you could use electrum wallet to access both versions. Or Trezor stated they would split the coins for you if you used a their device.
