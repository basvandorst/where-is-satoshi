CryptoCurrencies threaten the future of traditional banks.
CryptoCurrencies’ Achilles heel is public opinion; if the man in the street doesn’t trust them, they’re dead;
Banks (and other affiliated power-money institutions) control the media and elected politicians;
Bitcoin is the public face of CryptoCurrency.
None of this is surprising. My fear is that Crypto will lose this battle.

Equating Apple to Bitcoin (and ‘Apple Unlimited’ to BCH) is like equating the rings of Saturn to the smell of five week old ham. 
I don’t much like the underhandedness of making BCH outwardly similar to Bitcoin either, but comparisons like this are stupid.  One of the things that makes Bitcoin worthy of existence is that it is unowned, decentralised, non-governed by anyone - essentially things that make it not in any way like fucking Apple, or any other company.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:25:39
Which is my point - if Apple wasn’t fundamentally different (and incomparable) to Bitcoin, then yes - you’d see alternative versions of it trying to make money off the brand. But it is different and incomparable, hence a comparison like this post is stupid.

@_date: 2018-05-23 14:35:10
Don’t get me wrong - I despise PayPal. But my point was, Crypto/Bitcoin does not remove the need for centralised, governed financial institutions.
As an eBay seller, I actually offer a discount to anyone who wishes to pay with BTC, partly because of PayPal fees and partly because of the easy scams that favour the buyer every time. (I once sold an item to a dude in France, PP took my money back and refunded him when he claimed an empty box was delivered).
The person I replied to suggested that crypto means we don’t need PayPal, however PayPal is just an escrow service really. If we don’t need PayPal, we still need PayMate or PayBuddy or whatever to handle the escrow.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:38:30
Yes. A centralised, governed middleman. 
Don’t get me wrong, I hate PayPal, but crypto/bitcoin does not remove the need for that service that can act as escrow, or payment handling, whatever name you give it.
Smart contracts can go some way to resolving this issue I guess, but ultimately if people are buying an item from someone they don’t know and have no way of tracking down in real life, they want to have a middle man to handle the inevitable disputes.

When your bitcoins are worth less dollars, they are also worth less cups of coffee. When the dollar value goes down, the value as a currency to buy anything goes down with it. 
If you're bothered about measuring wealth in anything, be it bitcoins or baseball cards, the only way to figure out how wealthy you are is to figure out how much 'stuff' your currency can buy.  When the dollar value of bitcoin goes down, then you become less wealthy.

That guy at the bottom - that's not just new users. That's most users. Me included.
I've read a couple of books and a tonne of articles about BTC, and invested a small (but to me, significant) amount of money in it. I didn't do this to make money - I hodl mostly, and sometimes use it buy things. 
I try to keep up, and have watched videos and read pieces on segwit, BTCu, block sizes... but truth be told, I don't have the time or knowledge to understand it all. All of this discontent between and among the people who DO understand it is making BTC less appealing to me with every post.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:06:20
I appreciate you writing all of that. You make a very articulate, reasoned point with lots of explanation behind your opinions.  But that's the thing - there are people who make just as articulate, well-reasoned points that probably say those 'trolls' are not trolls.  Who does a guy like me listen to? 
There is bickering, and accusations of censorship, accusations of stupidity, accusations of political interference, people saying this is better than that, other people saying that is better than this.
And let's face it - if there was an actual definite answer about which thing is the BEST thing to do, then the people with the power to come to a consensus on it would have already done so.
It's interesting that you make the climate change analogy - from the point of view of a regular Joe like me, you can show me all the evidence you like that climate change is real, but there are other 'experts' who will show me evidence that it is not.  Because there are so many agendas and powerplays at work in the world, manipulating 'evidence' and information, then unless I personally become a career scientist and spend a lifetime collecting my own data, I actually have no way of knowing which side is correct.
As it happens, I believe climate change is a thing and that it should be the  priority for everyone, however that isn't because anyone has convinced me that THEY are the true experts and the others are trolls - it's because it's actually impossible for a regular person to know, therefore it's a coin toss - but the consequences of DENYING it and being wrong are far worse than the consequences of BELIEVING in it and being wrong.

Thanks for the info - and good news that the blackmailers came through with the decryption. They do tend to set the ransom at a reasonable amount - they want lots of people happy to pay, rather than being unreasonable.
Do you have any record of the bitcoin address that you sent the ransom to? If you know the date that it was you might find it in the transaction history of whichever wallet you use?
The reason I ask is it’s possible to sometimes do work to start to deanonymise the address - it’s a REALLY long shot but sometimes you get lucky.  If you do have the blackmailer’s address I will gladly share anything I do with you. :-)
@_date: 2019-03-23 08:39:24
Did paying the fine get the files back? Just out of interest? If you happen to have any record of the address that the money went to, I’d be really interested to know - I work on research into following the money from these types of things, and it’s not easy to find out the one-time addresses that were paid and then got files back.

Yeah I get that. But without CB's co-operation, analysis of your activity on the blockchain becomes virtually impossible, as you don't have your own addresses which could be watched or searched back over.
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:44:55
Well if that’s your take, and I wish to figure out what’s what here, I have to conclude that you’re the one who is wrong. 
For example: ‘privacy is being eroded as analysts get better at tracing coin’ is a factual statement.
The fact that paper money is what Venezuela has reverted to in the absence of infrastructure is a true statement as far as all reporting goes.
So if you’re suggesting that his entire comment is wrong, then your opinion is worthless.  I’m not saying I agree with the sentiment that Bitcoin is done, not at all - but he articulated his opinion pretty well and backed it up with rationale. It would be good if people trying to debate and disagree in this space would actually explain their views so that others can learn and form their own informed opinions.
@_date: 2017-01-12 21:13:07
I understand. So you think that if I had acquired my balance in CB by receiving bitcoin to my 'receive address(es), (as opposed to a fiat purchase directly from CB) I'd probably see the block chain data that I had expected to see, as those addresses would be assigned to my account? Makes sense now.
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:58:58
Yeah, that's what I'm surmising.  I think I've figured out what everyone already understands, then!
If that's the case, then, isn't Coinbase just acting like an enormous tumbler, albeit one that is keeping its own database of user identities linked to addresses used?  That is to say, activity done using CB would be reasonably immune to blockchain analysis - but would pay the price that CB knows what they are doing AND who they are?
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:53:03
Genuine question - why keep it in CB if you have the ability and understanding to keep it in a wallet, at will?  What do you see as the disadvantage to keeping in a wallet vs keeping it in CB?
@_date: 2018-10-07 07:56:17
Yeah agreed. Well it’s charged per size (in data) of the transaction message, and thus more inputs = more data. But generally speaking they’re much of a muchness for most ‘normal use’ wallets.
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:31:12
If they did that based on the rogue reviews, they would have to prove that the app developers were the ones responsible for the reviews - which unless they were dumb and just spammed them all from the same IP address that they use for legitimate access to the App Store, would be very difficult.
If an app could be removed just because SOMEONE dumped a load of fake reviews on it, then rival devs would just be forever doing it to get competing apps removed.
EDIT: So it seems apple DOES remove apps for this - however, I'd be surprised if they don't at least do SOME work to ascertain culpability first. Otherwise, it would be standard practice to make 500 5-star reviews for a rival, then report them to Apple and have them removed from the store.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:58:34
That sounds like you just got a very over-cautious restaurant. To my understanding, having a bitcoin transaction appear as unconfirmed and then somehow having it fail is so difficult to achieve and unlikely that to consider it a legitimate risk over the cost of a meal is disproportionate.
If they were signing the deeds to a house over to you I could understand the reluctance, but for low cost things (where they presumably have CCTV of you anyway, even if it DID later fail) it is an unnecessary level of caution.
Most places that take BTC aren't like this (to my knowledge) and those that are will improve with time and familiarity.

Transaction fee is unrelated to the value of the transaction. A 200 million dollar transaction will go through with the same fee as a 20 cent transaction.  It is determined by the state of the network and the volume of transactions happening.
Also the fee is voluntary - the sender decides how much fee to attach, in order to have the transaction prioritised by the network. That said - most consumer wallets will do this automatically, to a degree.
To give a general answer - right now, maybe 5-15 cents.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:30:24
I agree that anybody thinking that publicly displaying that you have a fair amount of money automatically means you're gonna end up tortured and robbed is paranoid and watches too much TV. But, to answer your closing question, there was a case in London a few months back of a face-to-face BTC sale turning into a robbery. I think they met in a public place, seller accepted cash, transferred the coin, then buyer used force/threats to take back the cash. There was a thread about it.

I am new to BTC, and as interested in learning about it as much as investing/trading/using it.
My first purchase was £20, via a broker on localbitcoins - I paid 10% above market value to cover 'costs associated with verifying me as a new buyer', which I accept. The (to buy) price on localbitcoins is generally 1-1.5% higher than Coinbase.
I subsequently bought £500 worth on Coinbase, so I could get it at the better price. As soon as the BTC was verified in my Coinbase account I sent it to my wallet that I have on my device (i.e. I have the keys, as opposed to having a login to an 'account' with Coinbase who hold the keys for me).
I've read some of your links, and I acknowledge the reasons to avoid Coinbase - however, for someone using BTC for reasons I am not sensitive about, that is to say I'm not avoiding tax or trying to make secret transactions, what alternative to Coinbase would you recommended as an entry/exit point from BTC to fiat currency?

It depends on how you acquired your BTC that are in your wallet. And your wallet probably comprises many public keys, all sitting under one wallet.

I buy into that entire concept, but you're looking at this from the point of view of someone who conducts a significant amount of financial activity in bitcoin. To the casual person just dabbling in it, your above comment comes across as paranoid and over-cautious.
I wanted to buy £500 of bitcoin, to play with, watch the value rise and fall, and learn about the practicalities of using it. You're saying that I should have accepted a significantly less favourable rate of exchange, because what? What, rationally speaking, are the banks/authorities going to do with the information that I bought £500 of bitcoin, IF they ever even give two hoots about such a minuscule but of activity?
Assuming that this is the extent of my involvement in bitcoin, what do you think I have 'sold' by using Coinbase and getting an extra BTC0.05 for my money?

Depends on your local laws, but it’s very likely that, as it is an obvious error, they would be legally entitled to return of the coin if a court ever had to decide. If your bank accidentally put £10,000 in your account, the same would hold true. In the UK, taking it and keeping it would constitute theft under the Theft Act.
That said, as others have suggested I would move it to your own wallet ASAP. (In your CB account, they can take it back without problem.)
Then I would sit on it and wait and see. If they demand it back, consider your options. There is every chance that they won’t notice, or when they see you’ve removed it from CB account they might ask for it back and give up if you don’t comply.
What I would NOT do is cash it out and spend the money, because there is a good chance they will demand it back and have legal backing to do so.

Perhaps not a majority, but I'd say they are mainstream. First Direct in the UK has been around for ten years or more, and is pretty much a household name.  Only a minority of people see its lack of a bricks-and-mortar premises as a reason not to use it.
As with everything, it's the bottom line that counts. Bitcoin will become mainstream when the customers see that it saves them money.
If a guy can see that his shopping / electricity bill / new car would cost 2% less if he paid with bitcoin, he will adopt bitcoin regardless of whether there is 'a place'. Right now, for the most part, merchants either don't accept BTC, or if they do the saving is not obviously passed onto the consumer. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 20:27:17
Not sure how big your bank is, but certainly the major Western banks know (perhaps not at branch staff level, though) exactly what bitcoin is.  They also know that if cryptocurrency becomes widely used, it may all-but-remove the need for their existence, and therefore their profit - as this possibility becomes more likely, I imagine you will see banks blocking transfers to/from exchanges as a way to try and hinder BTC's expansion into the mainstream, and most likely they will justify this by spouting about money laundering and drug deals.

What they are saying is, you have total control of your PK. You decide how to store it, what security measures to put in place, and if you believe there is a risk of compromise it is simple to move your coin to a new address with a new PK.
Your credit card details, however, are (a) routinely sent over networks you have no control over and (b) stored by other entities that you have no control over. Therefore you have no control over the security of your CC details, but you have full control over the security of your PK.
It is possible to use BTC and cut the risk of PK ‘leakage’ to pretty much zero, with good OPSEC.  It is impossible to use CC and do the same, and in fact you can’t even quantify the risk of CC leakage because you are not privy to the security protocols and habits of all those people you have to trust with the data.

My point was that for the moment, I am not using bitcoin as my currency, I am just converting small quantities of my fiat money into it as a way of learning (and, admittedly, with the daydream of a price rocket). 
If ever I decide to invest or conduct my business in bitcoin, I will look to ways of acquiring it that have more anonymity, but for now I am nothing more than a casual (like the majority of bitcoin users by number, I suspect) and so I'm not interested in paying Coinbase-price + a premium just so that The Man would struggle to know that it was my money if ever he were to try and find out.

For low value purchases, vendors should be happy with an unconfirmed (ie. instant) transaction.  You can’t pull a TX back from the mempool. There are circumstances in which it could somehow fail and eventually be returned, but this is rare enough that if I were selling coffee, I wouldn’t want you to wait for confirmation before giving you the coffee.
Bigger TXs are obviously different, as while the risk remains the same (ie. minuscule) the consequences of the TX failing are more severe.
The real issue isn’t the speed of a transaction, but the capacity of the network to handle volume of transactions needed for general use.
Lightning goes some way to resolving this, though I haven’t used it and only have basic understanding so can’t vouch.

Am I right in thinking that a batch tx on the blockchain would have a number of inputs and a number of outputs, with potentially multiple ‘actual’ transactions comprising that total?
If so - isn’t this how exchanges currently operate when it comes to people buying &amp; selling BTC via them?
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:11:54
Ah, assumed you were talking about the BTC transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:17:22
The size of the transaction (in terms of number of BTC) has no effect on the size of the fee.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:50:28
There’s a reason why BTC as a payment option won’t take off unless it’s bundled with some sort of advantage (ie. discount).
If someone owns BTC, it’s almost certainly because they believe that its value is going to rise at a rate &gt; the available interest for the fiat where they live.
If they believe that - why would they choose to buy something with it, if buying with fiat is an equal cost option?

Don't listen to the asshats who are ridiculing you for asking this question. You'd think there was a clause in Bitcoin that said *"You shall not dare to dabble with our precious cryptocurrency until you fully understand everything about how it works!"*
In a nutshell - 'owning' Bitcoin actually means that you have the private key(s) needed to 'spend' or 'send' your Bitcoin to someone else. There are a number of ways to store these private keys, including: having them written/printed on paper; having them stored in a software wallet; having them stored in a hardware wallet.
By 'owning' Bitcoin on an exchange like Coinbase, you don't actually have these private keys - they do. They simply let you have an account with them, and this will show you how much of THEIR Bitcoin 'belongs' to you. Which is perfectly fine, as long as THEY don't go bust, and THEIR Bitcoin doesn't get stolen.
Think of it as the difference between keeping your jewellery in a box in your house, and keeping it in a locker down at the bank. Lots of people think that the bank (ie. Coinbase) is vulnerable to being broken into, or having the contents of its vault seized, hence the 'don't store your stuff there!' attitude.
Probably more of a concern is that because the bank only has so many people working there compared to how many people have their stuff stored in its vault, then should a time come when everyone wants to get their jewellery out and sell it, they will find the bank with a month-long queue and people rioting outside, stopping you from getting to yours.

Blockchain.info is only so accurate at determining which out put is the change, though. I check out every tx I make to see how it is refelected in various blockchain explorers, and it's not uncommon for that site to get it wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:32:15
Oh yeah - that's a straightforward total_outputs - total_transactions = outputs_excluding_change, allowing for the error of a few tx that do not have change.
But the 'Estimated BTC Transacted' value is problematic for anyone to work out with accuracy.  Not that this particularly affects using these numbers to look at mempool size etc, I was just saying. :)

I went down to the car dealership and this guy outside was selling Ferrari’s. He told me I could buy a Ferrari Testerossa from him for £299.  I was pretty surprised, as I know those cars are worth £75,000 each, but wow, what a deal! I snapped his hand off!
Then I went to try and sell my Ferrari Testerossa for £75,000, and the buyer tells me it’s a not a real one, it’s actually a toy replica, worth about £300.

Crypto success depends upon mass adoption. Mass adoption means people being able to use it without fear of sanction. Most people will not risk breaking the law to use crypto, therefore no mass adoption, therefore crypto cannot succeed.
I’m not saying necessarily that crypto is ‘bannable’, but the whole argument that “you can make it illegal but that won’t stop us using it!” is completely lame. It sounds like something a stoner would say, which is quite apt given your analogy.

Thanks for taking the time to comment, but to anyone who has only a basic understanding of bitcoin and blockchain, it's exactly the kind of response I was talking about. I mean, what is 'more retarded than anything rbtc could ever come up with'? Team X, or Team Y?
Nobody can give a balanced, simple explanation of what the divide is and why. Who the fuck is Jihan? I can't even research it without spending an age doing so, because all research will tell me is that he is (a) a guy with some good ideas and plans for bitcoin or (b) a corrupt evil lying bastard.
So much partisan bullshit about this whole row that it is just too much work to try and form an educated view on it.

What are you on about? Are you drunk?
I made a comment that bitcoin is not connected to your name. You replied, implying that I was wrong.
What has any of that got to do with going to jail or blockchain analysis?
I'll just repeat my initial comment: bitcoin is not linked to your name. 
Are you disagreeing with that?
@_date: 2017-07-10 18:13:28
Mate, if you're using some version of the blockchain that includes recording your name with your transactions, then  I think it's you that doesn't understand!
I am not saying bitcoin is untraceable.
I am not saying bitcoin is 'safe' from the authorities.
I am not saying bitcoin cannot be monitored or investigated.
I am saying that bitcoin does not require your NAME to be recorded in the public ledger.
I have no idea why you think that it does.
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:15:29
Transactions (wallet IDs, date/time, quantity, fee)
Not public:
Everything else, including pretty much everything that is of any use to anyone.
Anonymity means unconnected to a name. Bitcoin is anonymous. It isn't secret or hidden, but it is absolutely anonymous (barring third parties who link names to wallets/addresses/transactions within their own data collection, e.g. brokers, but that is not part of bitcoin itself.)
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:54:32
I've tried asking this basic question here before. It's pointless. What happens is someone will reply to say: 
"X is what bitcoin needs to grow/dominate/survive/improve, but there are corrupt and stupid people who will tell you that Y is actually the answer."
And then someone will reply saying "Don't listen to those X guys! They are corrupt and stupid! Y is the answer!"
And unless you understand the bitcoin protocol, AND monetary systems and economics, AND politics, AND world affairs really, really well, you still won't have a clue who to believe.
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:49:58
Tell which part of bitcoin involves linking a NAME to anything? The word 'anonymous' literally means 'not associated to a name'.
Bitcoin is anonymous. 
Maybe you do not interpret the word 'anonymous' correctly.

The laws are written by the people with the most money. The people who stand to lose the most (maybe even everything) if crypto was allowed to reach its logical conclusion.
Crypto can only achieve its potential by becoming the norm, and if they enforce laws and regulations to criminalise people who make use of it - however stupid and ill-conceived those laws might seem - then it will not become mainstream.
It's fine to be bull-headed about it and say "They can't regulate it! That's the beauty of it!", but as seen in the OP's circumstances, if they introduce blockers to people using crypto then people wont use it.
If you tell small businesses that you're going to tax them double on income from sales via crypto, they will just not accept crypto. 
If you show people that the Inland Revenue (or IRS to most readers here) will be taking a very close look at the finances of people who have been flagged by their banks as being crypto users, then many investors and traders will be dissuaded from it. Etc etc. 
You can't police the internet, but you can pass enough bullshit laws against parts of it that they just can't become mainstream.

"When bad people try to discourage most people from doing something those people want to do, history shows they cling to it tighter."
I don't necessarily agree. The ~13% of the world's population that lives in China would certainly like to be able to access the same information and content on the internet that you and I can, but still me of those bad people have used the power they have to prevent that.
My view is that for bitcoin/crypto to become a normal part of life, in the same way that email or driving a car is now, then people like my mum, the local plumber, and his maybe-slightly-creative accountant need to be using it. If the people in power make using bitcoin a risk to, say, your likelihood of being approved for a loan, then those people will not come aboard.
Don't underestimate the power held by that top 1%. There are actual wars fought and populations kept financially suppressed all day vet the world just to keep them rich/richer. The system is currently arranged in such a way that they can threaten the adoption of crypto. Hopefully they will fuck up any action they try to take.

I fear that this power the system currently has is the reason bitcoin/crypto WON'T win over the banking system.
It isn't yet anywhere near the uptake required to be mainstream, and before the uptake reaches that sort of level the system can start to make it very difficult for people to join the 'revolution' by pulling Shit like the OP describes.
I really hope I'm wrong, and I'm hodling a chunk of my savings in the hope that I am being overly pessimistic.

Regardless of the currency used, how does the transfer of $4 million before and then immediately after the attack equate to ‘funding’ the attack.
I’m not saying this analysis is incorrect, I’m just confused. What is the scenario here? Who first owned the money prior to the attack, who did they give it to just before the attack, and then who was it sent to immediately afterwards?  What exactly was funded? Who got paid? For what?
