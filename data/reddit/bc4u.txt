Yes, I've heard it explained before, but I still have my four 333Mh/s USB miners running. They ROI'd already and now I let them run just to support the network. I also run a full node for that same reason.
I also purchased BTC, but the price is currently lower than what I bought in at so I am hodling.

How much you get per video? Most sites I see are so little and just to reach the payout threshold takes hours/days to reach just for a few cents.

Any chance you make them even cheaper?!? :D
@_date: 2014-09-14 20:16:17
Lol,.. Glanced at your title and thought it said "Tulips for Bitcoin?". 
Search through r/Bitcoin. There is a lot of information in here. Be careful of anything that you plan to invest in as there are a lot of scams out there.
Also, asking for donations/begging is frowned upon in here. You can find some BTC faucets out on the web to get some free mBtc,.. Tough it will take some time to collect enough to have it sent to your wallet.
Cheers, welcome to the party and don't drink too much kool aid.

Hopefully the Mining bubble pops and I can pick up some cheap miners... Then let a BTC bubble happen and I can get ROI (Possibly.. Hopefully,.. XmyFingers..)

Once you get verified with coinbase, you can do instant buys... Though I don't remember what the max per day/week is..
I don't know if celery has instant buy. Never messed with coin.mx

This. Move your BTC ASAP.

I don't see how there's a bubble yet... at least in the US. It's still is hard to get a mortgage and homes are not selling at all time highs. I had my house appraised a couple weeks ago and there's no way I'll ever see the money I bought it for back in '95.... and I don't even want to think about all the work I put into it over the years... :(
@_date: 2014-09-25 15:42:39
That's good to know. 
Of the last five years, three have been a 1% increase company wide. The other two they announced no increases.
Edit: had my years off...
@_date: 2014-09-18 12:41:53
True, one years time should still show a return... Though I wonder where I will be after one year which should be in January/February next year..
While we haven't hit the moon and I get agrivated at times, I keep reminding myself that I invested as  much as I am willing to lose and hodling for the long term. 
Also, it's more than just making a return on your investment. :D
@_date: 2014-06-23 23:16:38
That's cause you should be "hodling".. :D
@_date: 2014-10-07 22:21:24
No, but I tend to not listen to people when they have to throw in a sales pitch. It seems like the only reason he's ranting is to get you to buy from his business. 
I am aware that btc price has gone down, but I have also speculated on the way down and increased my btc holding. Still only invested what I can afford to lose. 
Cheers! :D

Running a full node from home here with my awesome 1.3Gh/s solo miners. No need to buy lottery tickets any more as solo mining is my ticket.. Chances are I'll never win, but I get a thrill out of doing it.

@_date: 2014-09-19 23:15:04
Why I already am "mining for the Bitcorn network"... Running a full node and mining with my 1.3Ghs farm (333Mhs x 3).. Don't think I will ever get a block, but if I do, I will hodl it tight. :D
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:20:22

@_date: 2014-08-24 19:16:25
So my 1.3 Gh that I'm solo mining with for bitcoin will never pay out..? 
I ROI'd originally thru slush but now solo mine and run a full node for fun/support of the network.. :)

No, my little guys (1.3 Gh/s total) in the garage are still mining away... Not that they are finding any blocks but they're supporting the network for decentralization and as backup in case the bitcoin data centers of the world get taken down.. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:31:29
Full node here with 1.3Gh/s solo mining to support the network and keep it decentralized.  
I also bought btc and speculating with it. I'm not riding this like a stock to the moon but just trying to work my way up to 21 btc so that I can be one in a million. :D
At that point I'll put it in cold storage for 10+ years.

Haha,.. Yes, it's not like watching a train wreck. It's like watching one of those shipping oil tankers run aground. At some point, it will split open and all the oil will spill out. 
I was playing the market on the way down, selling for fiat on peaks and buying btc on dips. I was increasing my btc hodlings but my fiat amount was shrinking. I'm currently hodling my fiat. If price comes down enough, I might actually reach my goal of owning 21 bitcoins! (or maybe even more..!)
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:52:47
I wouldn't think insolvent. They have most of their btc in cold storage and I'm sure that would take a few days to bring back online..?

Welcome to the Rabbit Hole!
Being that you freaked out on a couple troll comments below tells me that you should start out with a small amount and don't go over more than you can afford to lose.
If your investing via "hodling" coins long term, make sure you go with a paper wallet and expect to hodl a couple years.
If your going to be speculating by playing on the exchanges, the coin price is volatile and major price swings can make or break you.
Good luck!

Yup, I will when I can afford more.. Right now I just hodl/speculate what I have. 
The wife is still on the old fiat system and getting 3% cash back on her credit card usage so its hard to curve the current spending system. Also now that we have moved towards the minimalist life, we don't have as many expenses.

I think hodlers are not idiots because they haven't lost any coin. They're just hodling.
Those selling are not fools either, but are putting themselves at risk because if they don't time the market right, they can end up with less coin than they sold... 
Either way it's a gamble. Cheers! :D
@_date: 2015-01-28 02:37:41
Thank you for the tip! and for the caution on tipping too low. I've been reading on Changetip.com how I can tip on other sites. The tips that I've received and will be adding will be used as a way to spread the knowledge. 
I've tried in the past to explain BTC to family and friends and they agree that it sounds like a better way to hodl and transfer wealth, but don't go any further than that. Maybe this is a way I can get them testing the waters without pressing too hard. Their are also some YouTube sites that put out nicely presented videos that I wouldn't mind tipping. :D
Thanks again!
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:39:21

How do you store your btc? Have you had any problems with your wallet(s) and lost any?

@_date: 2013-12-09 19:41:37
Look to the right on your screen under the **Bitcoin** heading. There are a few links for Getting Started, FAQ, etc,... those are good info. 
If you cant find an answer to a question in there, use the Search in the upper right corner as most noob questions have been asked\answered hundreds of times.
Welcome aboard! :)

Good question,.. Did you try asking their support?
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:22:46
How so? 
You start the post without providing a lot of details. Just that you bought and immediately tried to cancel. Assumed you were new to bitcoin and this must of been your first buy as you are posting with an account only an hour old..
Hope your cancel gets resolved.

I'm right there with you.. While I would like to keep or even see a return on my investment, I put in what I could (and will not let myself feel bad about) afford to lose. I will hold as I believe in what bitcoin represents. I want this to be the future and my kids to just hear the stories of how messed up the banking industry was...
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:53:05
But wouldn't it be like carrying cash in your wallet around town with you? A good pick pocket (or in crypto terms... Key logger/malware on your pc..) could get to your wallet and it's contents?
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:44:30
What's the purpose you buying in the first place? I don't get how you can commit to a purchase and immediately want to cancel...
You DO have the funds to cover it though right?
I bought some at $1100/btc right before the correction started and will suck it up and hold.

Finally got thru on my 6th try... I know I answered correctly each time though... Weird...
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:11:59
I look at the cryptocurrency security options like different levels of carrying your cash around.. 
Unencrypted wallet and on an online pc = Carrying cash in your hand while walking down a busy city street.
Encrypted wallet and on an online pc = Carrying cash in your pocket while walking down the street.
Encrypted wallet on an offline pc = Keeping cash at home.
Paper wallet = Keeping cash in a safe at home.
Online wallet = Handing your cash over to a freind or business and trusting them with its safe keeping.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:49:22
No clue on how something like that would be able to kick off. If I had discovered bitcoin and invested back in the beginning, I would quit my job and start making it happen... :)
