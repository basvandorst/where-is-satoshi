This sub method is very dodgy currently.    
As soon as I saw it available, I subbed to a streamer for 3 months, but he didn't see any notification on it anywhere, only noticed when a sub badge appeared in chat.

This is cheaper : 
Around a dollar cheaper if you purchase a 50$ card.
It only sells 20$ and 50$ cards though

If Bitcoin hits say 20k , it is more likely that USD would crash than Bitcoin....

If what you are saying is true , then Bitcoin has already covered the internet. I believe that Bitcoin has potential and is expanding , but I cannot really imagine how you could say that Bitcoin has covered 90% of the internet.
For eBay , Amazon , there are alternatives , but this is cheaper for Amazon, because of the free 2 day shipping .
For gaming , steam games , XBox live gold , there are no Bitcoin options that I know of , and there was a huge discussion of the lack of steam wallet funds sites when Zeevex dropped their partnership with steam.
I've just covered the big points of sale. Now think of all the individual blogs and artists who sell their merchandise. You can now buy that too with Bitcoin. 
This is where snapCard wins. They allow you the purchase the niche goods too , with Bitcoin. They have expanded the horizons of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is slowly and steadily becoming more easy to use online, and **this is the next step.**

Gyft is cheaper and more legitimate.
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:37:18
This website basically allows you to click their bookmarklet on any website , any website at all and buy a product for BTC.
Purchases with large websites like eBay and Amazon are automated and you can click "Add to snapCard" instead of Add to Cart. That allows you to choose your delivery , add any additional notes etc.
If the website has not been indexed and automated , they will manually purchase it for you within a few hours. 
This is way better compared to Gyft , they allow you to buy from **literally** any website. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 11:32:39
A more legitimate and faster source would be Gyft.
They sell codes for Zeevex which are redeemable in tonnes of places , including steam.
You get lower prices as compared to this website.
78 mbtc for zeevex code instead of 84.
As well as getting reward points that you can use for discounts.
Gyft also has other awesome things to buy for bitcoin.
Note: You have to set location to US to buy Zeevex.

I live in Dubai and this idea sounds awesome.
One problem is the conversions. I would need to sell my cash to an exchange , then transfer the Bitcoins by telling my Grandparents with limited tech knowledge to get a wallet and then send it to them. And then , they would need to exchange it , which seems near impossible.
Another thing you can note is that with Expo 2020 being hosted here , adoption of Bitcoin by Dubai by 2020 will help propel global adoption.
What is this pizza restaurant you speak of , I've not heard of it....
@_date: 2014-05-22 13:16:42
I don't get all the hate this comment is getting.
Bitcoin is an amazing concept. 
But currently , it is too young to be used reliably. A person who creates products which they buy with fiat and then sells those products for BTC may get hit by a sudden loss , if BTC drops or the buyer may have overpaid by a huge margin if Bitcoin shoots up.
And knowing the Bitcoin economy , this happens a lot.
@_date: 2014-05-22 13:32:54
That was a *slight* exaggeration.
The total money in world circulation is 60 trillion $
Dividing that by 15 - 20 million bitcoins somewhere in the future , would mean :-
Each Bitcoin would be worth 3-4 million $ , if it was 100% of the transactional volume.
So , if it reaches 1% of transactional volume , at around 30-40k , it will probably be unstoppable. 
The current problem to be tackled is making bitcoin easy enough to use such that it can be used with lesser technological knowledge and quicker to use , such that it would be able to be used for microtransactions. (I don't want to wait for 10 minutes to buy my groceries)
Secondly , there are dangers to both providers and consumers buying with bitcoin as they are negatively affected by drops or rises in bitcoin value respectively.
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:47:46
Yes , but both of them work on a small selection of sites.
Also , as mentioned by anon , they use Amazon prime. That means you can get free 2 day deliveries too.
Gyft and Egifter can offer cashback because they get paid royalties from the gift cards they sell. On the other hand , this place does not rely on gift cards , you can buy anything.
I aimed this at the PC gamers , because now you can buy steam games too. Just give them the store link and they mail you the steam gift.
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:12:34
Yeah , took me some time to find this.
On the way , I found other services selling it with upto 50% fees ( 30$ for a 20$ card ) , and finally found this having only a 5% fee :D

There are dozens of sites who pay your taxes online.
Each and every one needs your SSN.
If you don't trust them with your SSN , leave the taxes part , enjoy purchasing from Amazon , eBay and the rest of the internet with complete privacy.
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:36:34
You need to identify yourself with your SSN only if you want to pay your taxes. This is because they need to directly pay your taxes for you.

Some random online game I tried playing, called MineThings accepted Bitcoin, so I checked it out.     
This was mid 2013.

What you need to understand is that the halving is not going to be the immediate cause of any price change. The effects of the supply drop won't be seem in the short run.
All price changes shall be due to others' speculation. Bitcoin may go through the roof or it may fall like never before. All I'd expect is some major instability in price.
I don't think it is a good idea to invest right now without fully knowing what you're doing. And I don't think it's a good idea to invest in mining right before the halving reduce returns drastically

One block is generated on average every ten minutes. The maximum block size is 1 mb. Some feel this is too small and will bottleneck btc transaction rate.
Transactions can't really be made any smaller, so to scale btc, the only way is increasing block size
@_date: 2016-06-20 12:18:18
Hypothetically at least.
Miners may not include it if the fee is too low.
However eventually, if the value is high enough and the coins are old enough for it to not be considered spam, some miner will likely include it for free
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:41:32
Yes.    
If any are left over or not included for any other reason (too low fee, so miner decides not to), they will be stored in the miner's memory pool to be put into a future block.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:35:04
If you're using that metric for RUB you need to use the same metric to gauge BTC's change in price.
By that metric:
BTC per $ then= 1/830    
BTC per $ now= 1/583
% change = ((1/830) - (1/583))/(1/830) = 42%
It doesn't take your claimed understanding of "international and monetary economics" to realize that comparisons between different units are gibberish.

A fork is when a change in the protocol changes which blocks are valid and invalid.
Let's say I increase the block size to 2 mb. This is a hard fork, because miners in the old protocol reject all new blocks. 
Let's say I reduce block size to 500 kb. This is a soft fork, because miners in the old protocol may accidentally break rules but still recognize the blocks from the new protocol as valid.
So why is a hard fork more dangerous? Let's say 90% of the mining power upgrades.
In the soft fork: one in 10 blocks are from miners on the old protocol. These blocks are invalid. But they are rare and ignored. They consider blocks by the new protocol valid so they don't make a competing chain. 
In a hard fork: the old miners consider all new blocks to be invalid. So they begin their own chain that competes with the main chain.
So the difference is: if majority upgrades, a soft fork makes old miners irrelevant unless they update. But a hard fork makes the community fracture as older miners have their own coins and transactions and everything. Hard forks run a risk of catastrophic failure where the btc ecosystem gets cut into two living competing halves whereas a soft fork forces the minority to either join the majority or be forced into irrelevance

If 33.19 was the initial value, the currency has risen, making your point moot.
If you're saying that the currency has fallen from 65.45 to 33.19, 65.45 has to be the initial value.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:17:29
Percent change = Change in value/Initial value
Which is ((33.19 - 65.45)/65.45) 
If you want it more intuitively, think of it like this:
Let's say I have shares of 10$ a piece. They become worthless, and become 0$ a piece.
Your method says I've lost (0-10)/0 = an undefined amount of value.
But it is obvious, and given by (0-10)/10 that I have lost 100% of my value.

4.6 clams (~$35) per address with a non-dust balance. This includes BTC, LTC and DOGE addresses. So you could have a bit coming your way.
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:24:58
51 characters in a private key, so you could think of 51! ways to arrange it, roughly 10^66 tries. However, due to repeats in the key, this should be easier, my guess would be something like 10^60 tries.
But this is still computationally infeasible. Sorry.

Most websites accept it instantly.
Whenever I buy something through BitPay, it takes mere seconds.
Confirmations are only required by some services, as the quantity of btc is small and a rare double spend can be covered by margins.

Damn.. I'm remembering looking at all the people who said BTC would hit 2k when it hit 1k ages ago and thinking they were insane to expect it to happen anytime soon

20% may be far more than 15 BTC to him. He has mentioned he's losing upto 10k USD in daily fluctuations, so it definitely seems like it.

Some googling shows that bip decryption can take seconds to minutes.
Brute forcing may take more time than expected. It really depends on how many combinations of the characters you don't know are there
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:18:13
I presume the wallet can be accessed if the recoverer successfully gets the password?
If so, I'd go with someone trustworthy.
I can likely do it for you, but you'd be safer off finding someone trusted.
Better still, this is what I suggest:
1-create a new bip encrypted wallet.   
2- obscure 5% of the key.   
3- get someone to create code to brute force the last 5%.   
4- post the code publicly and let it be reviewed to ensure it doesn't do anything evil.    
5-deposit 15 btc in an escrow.   
6- give an extremely trusted escrow your 95% and the code. Make the escrow run the code retrieve the wallet and send you the private key.    
Ideally you could simplify this by using an extremely trusted escrow who could retrieve the code, but the method I've outlined will protect you even with an untrusted retriever
Pm me if you'd like me to program the solution, it shouldn't take long
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:11:44
So what is the missing 5% of these keys? Any idea?
Have you run these all and seen if they work? I'll try tomorrow and check if any of these work
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:50:47
First, at the amount being far too much to be feasible:
He could have created the wallet in 2012, when BTC was in the single digits. It'd be worth a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars in early 2013. 
Or maybe he's just a rich investor who used BIP 38, and forgot a few characters of his key.
Second, at it needing serious skills, and the person getting kudos from the crypto industry:     
He says he knows majority of the password. If that is true, and there are only a few thousand possible passwords based on the info he knows, a smart enough coder could create a program to generate all the possible passwords that fit his description and attempt decryption with them.
@_date: 2016-07-02 09:24:57
Is the # the character to be found? Is it just one character?
I'm going to need more details on where you think the unknown characters are going to be.
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:52:00
He mentioned that he created multiple wallets with the same password that he has forgotten.
To access a wallet, both the encrypted private key and the password would be needed. He has publicly provided the encrypted private key of one of the empty wallets, and if someone generates and gives him the password, he'll use it to open the encrypted private wallet with the actual BTC.
@_date: 2016-07-02 09:31:02
You said "211Baantjes3  somewhere else?
Both of them seem rather different, could you explain what you think the passphrase is?
@_date: 2016-07-02 05:36:43
Some questions:
1- How long is the password?    
2- How many characters are you missing?     
3- Do you know what type of characters the remaining ones are (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, etc?)?
If you tell me these three, I'll estimate the time it would take to retrieve the password.
@_date: 2016-07-02 10:15:54
Googling leads me to both Baantjes and Omhoog being dutch words, making it more likely that it's not in English than it's l33ted.
@_date: 2016-07-02 09:26:04
He has multiple encrypted keys, all using the same password.
He will provide an empty encrypted key. When the random person finds the password, he will be able to open the empty wallet but not the main wallet.
He is secure in all cases.
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:42:40
It has under 30 cents, maybe he isn't going to do much with it?
@_date: 2016-07-02 07:56:34
Yup, per guess.
If 95% means 19 of 20 characters are known, even with a 80 character key that's only 4 characters to check.
With lower + upper + numbers, at 1 second per guess it would take 3 months in the average case scenario.
If he knows it is only lower or upper it will take under 3 days in the average case scenario.
From the googling I've done, it takes minutes on phones and seconds on browsers and stuff. Assuming he's willing to spend upto 10k$ on it, it wouldn't be too hard to purchase computing power to try to decrypt it.
@_date: 2016-07-02 10:14:31
He made a comment 11 hours ago talking about multiple encrypted keys, and you posted the comment I replied to 2 hours ago?
