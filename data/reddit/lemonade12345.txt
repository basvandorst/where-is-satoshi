because they will adapt, just like the music/movie industry did. and remember cc companies provide a service which bitcoin doesn't (consumer protection, membership rewards etc). with bitcoin, it is up to the merchants to pass their savings on.

not entirely true. if apple payments work the way they've shown, they will dramatically reduce credit card fraud, and processing fees can be reduced as a result. and one of the selling points of bitcoin was no fraud and low/no processing fees.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:10:19
if you understand bitcoin, risk is not huge, and it is getting smaller by the day. but in the eyes of the general public, it is risky. it can't be seen as a safe haven when most people still think it's a ponzi etc

the real problem is the sites use shady tactics - auto-renewal without making it clear. that's the real reason they have high chargeback rates. bitcoin actually isn't that great for porn sites; they rely on people forgetting to cancel their accounts. it might help change their business model though.

@_date: 2014-07-31 18:22:04
It solves the problem that the US government has created trillions of dollars out of thin air within the past 5 years, stealing my purchasing power. But of course, you're an idiot, and think all bitcoin is for is to save a few seconds when making a transaction.

apple are taking their cut from the cc companies; charges for merchants remain the same.
in the long run, processing fees could even be reduced if this reduces fraud (and if there is sufficient competition, perhaps from a company integrating bitcoin for payments).

i don't think we're at the stage where people who do not have bitcoins would go and buy them so they can spend it at amazon. if amazon accepted bitcoin today, i'd imagine the vast majority of sales would come from early adopters (who will not all necessarily replace the coins they spend)

It is not working fine. Fucking idiots want to bury their head in the sand. I am not a newbie, I am trying to withdraw more than 100 coins, and I get this error:
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW BITCOINS AT THE MOMENT.
Fuck this sub, down-voting the truth.

Edit: I've received an email now from Bitstamp saying BTC withdrawals were blocked because of an increase in phishing emails. They will re-activate withdrawals once I confirm my computer is secure.

best case scenario? i can't really comment on that, but some people are predicting $100k+ per bitcoin, so maybe a 100x return over 5 years. worst case scenario? maybe lose half its value before you have a chance to pull out.
but with some of the altcoins, sure you can get a 100x return over a few days, but you could also lose 90% in the same time.
reward is always (well, at least always should be in a perfect market) proportional to risk.

okay, let's do this logically.
is one of the selling points of bitcoin low/no fraud? if yes (which it is), anything that reduces CC fraud reduces that aspect of appeal of bitcoin.
and apple pay has the potential to reduce CC fraud which in turn can reduce fees. low fees are another appeal of bitcoin which has been diminished.
so two of bitcoin's selling points have been reduced. so it is wrong to say this doesn't compete with bitcoin AT ALL, because it does.

i hate banks. i went to do a wire transfer the other day (because that account doesn't let me do wire transfers online).
took about half an hour, had to explain why i was wiring the money, had to be authorized by a manager, and during the process, one of the steps of the process actually said in capitals THE CUSTOMER SHOULD NOT SEE THIS PAGE, i saw it because the computer monitor was tilted.
they treat every customer like a criminal whilst holding our own money hostage. the receipt i got for the transfer even says 'this letter confirms your request for us to make a payment on your behalf'. i don't even like the wording of that, i'm not requesting you to make a payment on my behalf, i'm telling you to transfer my own money.

What is the difference between an ETN and an ETF? ELI5 please.
I think there's also an ETN(?) based in Sweden. It's available on Interactive Brokers, so there is global access. The country it's based in doesn't really matter.
Do these ETNs buy/sell actual BTC on BTC exchanges like the Winklevoss ETF plans to? (Once/if they run out of their existing coins, if they're planning on selling their own stash).
If they do, why are we looking forward to the Winklevoss ETF (other than the hype) when there is already the Swedish ETN, and now this, which anyone can buy into. If we're expecting a bump in price due to the Winklevoss ETF allowing institutions to buy the underlying asset in a regulated way; that already exists with the Swedish ETN and now this...

the thing i've realised is not to listen when people say this is high risk, this is low risk etc. i was told gold is low risk, yet it's lost around 40% in two years. the probably of bitcoin being worth zero tomorrow is 0%, could it lose 40-50%? absolutely, but so did gold and that was supposed to be "safe".
i think if you truly understand bitcoin you'll realise it's not as risky as most people make it sound; it is risky, but so is every investment.

Pretty safe bet - will probably be a lot higher.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:08:10
Each exchange has its own supply and demand. Bitstamp has been down for most of the last 24 hours. The price is higher because when people were panic selling on the other exchanges, the people wanting to sell on Bitstamp couldn't. During that time it is possible more fiat was deposited into the exchange and once trading resumed, there was more demand than there would've been a few hours earlier (if the site had been working).
I hope my explanation is clear enough, I don't think I've explained it that well. But in short, the Bitstamp market is distorted; the price there is higher than it should be.

You have choices at the top and the left. For example, if you think Bitcoin will achieve peak penetration in 10 years, with a 10% penetration of potential demand the price will be $10,407 in a year. That's my understanding.

It's funny how they can manipulate gold prices and then make up reasons for why it should be the price it is afterwards.
"Gold is falling because investors are more confident; gold is falling because QE is about to end blah blah blah". It's all bullshit.
Bitcoin is currently too small to be affecting gold prices in a significant way, but it definitely could in the near future.
The only reason for the current fall in gold prices is manipulation. That's the only reason.

This guy is the biggest hypocrite. Not that long ago, he tweeted that he sold his bitcoins, and later bought them at a lower price to increase his stash. That was probably a lie, he would've been very lucky if he actually managed to buy in lower.
He probably got stung and bought back in at a loss.
And now he says he is a true believer and is in it for the long haul? Dude, you sold not that long ago to make a "quick 5-10x". What the hell are you talking about?!

There is some truth to this, a lot of it is wrong, but if you think about the current state of the economy, and his current views on "digital currencies" you can see why he appears to be in favor.
I don't really have time to explain in full, but (at the moment) bitcoin is good for the goals he is trying to achieve. The problem is when/if bitcoin becomes large enough, his views (and the views of lawmakers in the US) will rapidly change. But for now, bitcoin is working in their favor.

The banking industry has a lot of power. If bitcoin ever becomes mainstream, they will definitely lobby the government for regulation etc.
And if it becomes even bigger than that, no country will willingly give up their control over the money supply. There is absolutely no way the US will give up its power to control (mainly to print) dollars without a fight.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:05:39
I am also cautiously hopeful but it will be a difficult journey.
What I was trying to get at, is that currently Bernanke is happy with bitcoin because it is still very small, and anything that takes out some of the excess liquidity from QE is welcome. As you mention, it also has the added benefit of capital gains tax etc.
Gold prices have been manipulated for some time now, to hide the true state the economy is in right now. Do you think Bernanke would rather the price of bitcoins skyrocket or the price of gold? Obviously (currently) bitcoin. Why? Because it can be explained as a 'crazy bubble'. But if the price of gold goes up, it will be much harder to deny there is something fundamentally wrong with the economy. So for now, if gold investors are selling to get into bitcoins, this makes Bernanke very happy.
I reckon bitcoin would have to increase another 10x for it to be seen as a serious threat. Then, their stance most probably will change. But for now, it's just a very convenient way to collect taxes through capital gains tax (as you mention) and soak up some excess liquidity.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:31:46
This really doesn't mean anything, not many people search buy USD. And people buying silver, gold probably already know where/how to buy it, therefore no need to search.

This makes sense, it's a much better explanation of what he's trying to say.
But the portion of gold's value attributed to it's physical usage (I think this is what he means by intrinsic value) is quite small, I think the vast majority of gold's price is due to investment demand. So speculation.
You can say the exact same thing about bitcoins. Bitcoins have at least some value due to its properties. Arguably not $420 worth of value per BTC, so a portion of the price could be considered to be a result of speculation. That is the same for gold.
