This is what he said in that post:
"Fake Proof-of-Reserve
I can confirm OKCoin removed a number of accounts (used by OKCoin bots) to pass the Proof-of-Reserve audit in Aug 2014. In essence, these bots trade on fractional (or fictional) reserves. Stephan Thomas was lied to during the audit. This is an unfortunate limitation of the proof-of-reserves method.
As a side note, Stephan Thomas specifically did not want any compensation for his audit efforts. Before the audit, OKCoin offered to make a donation in his name to a charity of his choice. He named a charity. After the audit was carried out, OKCoin never made that donation. Zane is aware of this. In fact, Zane followed up with Star several times after the fact, Star refused."

Yep, one company will finally realize the dream of travelling back through time to mine Bitcoins in 2009.

I just want to point out that CZ never stated directly that OKCoin is insolvent or operating on fractional reserves.

Lol, I read the whole thing, had to....those people are so misinformed, I guess that's what we're dealing with. Upwork could do Bitcoin deposits and withdrwals risk free; it would be great withdrawal option for freelancers.

You're going to have a difficult time withdrawing USD from btc-e to any US bank account or money service, I think it might be impossible.

I'd assume they have accounts at most major exchanges. There was an accidental e-mail leak at okcoin a while ago, that showed Circle has an institutional account there., which is funny considering this subs collective opinion of OKcoin.

"The records allege that the company platform was used  in money transfers to accounts linked with suspected terrorists. "
Doesn't sound good TBH.

He was selling 30k BTC at $300 - 10% below market value - A couple weeks later, price was at $450+. Man, I miss that volatility.

Be careful if you're buying through localbitcoins or a similar service, you will probably be charged a premium for the BTC
