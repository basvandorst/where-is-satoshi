This never crossed my mind... really, I had nothing but honest intentions.
@_date: 2012-04-22 16:31:16
a little paranoid, i guess.

No, it wouldn't, since the time is based on the Federal Reserve's ACH network that processes the bank transaction.

The problem is that .001 BTC wouldn't be a problem if we're dealing with 10,000 USD/BTC, so having a restriction like that would need to be fluid. Good for you on your rule with the bots. Still, there's something that makes me less enamored with someone just setting up a computer and letting it run to make money than other things. But of course I'm thinking more about High-Frequency Trading.

I mean technically, great... go ahead and set up bots for people. They're not illegal, but no one likes them. It's bots that have apparently been messing with the exchange rate today and overwhelming Mt Gox, so they're not something people want to see in the bitcoin world.

Can you explain this further?
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:31:49
Wouldn't that just be based on how fast the Fed notifies Gox of the transaction going through? I'm not an expert, but I assume that Gox showing the credit is based solely on how fast they are notified by the Fed of the movement of your money.

AH, NOW WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE! 
Sorry for the confusion, that must have been aggravating.
Hmmm, here I cannot help.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:23:25
Really? That seems incredibly fast, and would make me reconsider only wanting to use a credit card. 
Anything stand out as to why your transaction could have been faster? Did you place the transfer at a weird time or anything like that?

We're talking about $2 worth of bitcoins here...
Yes, we all know that this is possible and a terrible idea when it comes to actual BTC transactions, but this is $2 we're talking about.

The links on the sidebar can actually be quite overwhelming.
Personally, I've gone through everything and yet haven't found somewhere I would feel comfortable using. 
Either they've got a high fee (close to 4%) or there is a bank delay, which with a volatile market I wouldn't want. So the option is to pay 4%? That, to me, seems like a lot just to charge your credit card money to get BTC.

What's the point of this?
Click on the person's name... they look like a scammer.

Thanks! I wish we had better stats for things like this, because 3-5 days seems daunting. In that time your great investment plan could be negated by a rise in the price.

The price is not locked:
From their website it says:
