So these are the addresses you end up with:
What are the ones you intended to send to?
I'll generate locking scripts manually and check
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:52:14
Right, it is not. I'm sorry that you learned it this way. Hope the loss is not critical.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:59:27
It is hardest, but not hard. The docs literally describe what should be included in digest for segwit spending signature, step by step. 
Totally agree with the second point. 
I just tried to say that it is not that complicated.  
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:14:54
Yes, it's not that easy but...
1) Hot wallet. What's wrong with it? Sending from hot wallet to segwit - no changes. Sending from segwit - yes. Needs some effort.
2) QR codes. They have nothing to do with segwit. 
3) Storage. Migrated gradually with change addresses. You spend old output and return money to new segwit. Actually, I'm not aware of any other way to do it at once
4) Rollout. Well, like any other change.
5) Payments. Like others who already support segwit.
6) Test. Ehmm. Testnet? That's why it exists
7) Users. Weak argument in my opinion
8) Fees calculation. According to the formula provided by the spec which is straightforward.

Great. But the fourth currency is called wrong )

Of course it is not the same for their big Enterprise app. I'm not trying to say that it must be done in one day. The point is the task is not that complicated.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:03:13
I know, trailing zeros after decimal point don't count, but why? Given that it's only 8 maximum 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:11:57
I hope it was a joke
Initial comment, I mean
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:41:08
People, for God's sake, why do you even react on these posts?
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:05:01
Might be the problem with my country then. Hmm. I open the door and all I can see is this circle in the center and background picture. Thanks for trying.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:57:53
Right. I would suggest something between No information and Neutral 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:25:54
I first thought that it was kind of exchange operation. But looks like you just entered BCH address to transfer money to.
Nothing you can do unless you own the private key. Those are two separate block chains.
You just sent BTC to your address in BTC block chain.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:02:24
Sorry, but you are totally mistaken. Your transaction is not segwit, because you are sending to segwit, not from.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:39:06
Yeah, definitely. Proof Of Fall - a picture. Very smart
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:58:59
How about calling it Bcash?
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:09:47
Sorry? I didn't get it. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:02:46
Nothing assholish. You are right. It's not the same. But the idea must be clear
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:53:51
Regular template: 
I encourage you to {buy/sell}. This is based on {reason}. I'm not 100% sure though.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:04:34
And you are absolutely right. Witness data is moved from block (and you save block space) only when you spend FROM segwit. When you send from old address to segwit nothing changes (in fact, it does, but not what they expect) 
Most people here do not even understand how it works.
Just happy to see a familiar word
Sorry if it is kind of rude, but stop constant price-fapping and read something about tech side of Bitcoin

Still too expensive )

I use self-written key generator, kind of a brain wallet, but more secure. And everything I need to restore a particular set of keys is in my head. Not that I don't trust trazors or ledgers. But I really like managing my keys myself.
Edit: also it makes hodling easier since you can't just simply spend your coins
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:17:21
Do you even understand that you just literally said: I know nothing about Bitcoin. And I hate Indians. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:40:08
Can we make a sticky post with the link? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:54:45
According to their FAQ, you can't but Bitcoin there. That's sad (
Edit: not for hodlers 
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:00:51
Nope. At least for me it shows the price of 2 btc
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:13:29
Makes sense, but this solution sucks too. Newbies coming to ask for help now must post links to"somewhere" to ask their question. Plus, some text posts are really great to read.

Even though a couple of other similar trackers already exist, I like the graph. Bookmarked

I believe in Bitcoin because I'm from the future

Why do you even care of what they say?
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:03:37
Don't get me wrong but I'm against this position. I think what should be done is
1) Change icon
2) Call it something not containing the word Bitcoin (Bcash will do)
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:18:31

They are. One transaction may contain inputs and outputs of different favor at the same time: segwit, native segwit, regular. It does not matter
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:35:12
Just information
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:05:03
It will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever became the real Bitcoin. It's a **hard fork**. It will never remove this fact from its history. Period
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:00:54
As I mentioned, I just checked it without any VPNs. It works. 
Unfortunately, I know nothing about coinmama. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:39:24
Do you have access to your private keys? Not seed words or recovery phrases. In this case you can move coins manually to a new wallet. Of course given that your transaction is really in the block chain. 
Also, check your transaction somewhere else apart from blockchain.info
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:59:04
I didn't say a word about where I run this software. But you decided it for yourself )
My private keys never leave a computer that never connects to internet. 
What I do: 
* Get info about unspent outputs from online sources
* Move it to offline computer
* Create and sign transaction there with 
* Move transaction back to online pc and broadcast it.
Yes, it is a lot of work. But it is highly safe.

@_date: 2018-02-21 04:45:58
Your just can't measure fee in satoshi. The right way is to use satoshi/byte. Your 40000 sounds good at present (more than necessary) as long as your transaction is of avg size. But if your transaction is very big, it's different. 
It's just for information, since I doubt that your transaction is so huge that your 40000 turns into low fee

If you consider older people, that's right. But it is not targeted to them. He already has their votes)

It's not exactly what I mean. Just imagine for a moment that country makes Bitcoin illegal in any sense. You can even get to prison for it. You can use VPN, you can buy/sell it locally hand to hand. But there fact that you might get a couple of years for it will be real pain in the ass. That's what I mean. They can't ban it. But they can make your life much much more complicated.

Well, technically it's closer to 2 s/b than to 1. 
Good anyway. But it's been several days since mempool reached this low 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:56:02
Right. That's what I did a week ago. Moved funds stuck in old addresses to segwit ones.

In my opinion, node submission form must be for node submission. 
I would just create a form with concrete ip, donation method (and so on) fields. It would be more intuitive than a general form with message and hint what to write in the field.  
Just my opinion )
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:38:42
And you are right. There is just no way to tell if an unspent output is segwit until an owner spends it

Pretty much the same stuff is described in the community rules. I fully support this position but there is nothing you can do about it while majority is for memes and 'i just pooped (read: sent transaction)' posts.

Write down you wif. Then go to Wallet Details and try to restore it from paper: just to make sure that you haven't made any mistakes and everything is ok.
Plus, consider using segwitaddress.org to generate pk - &gt; segwit address pair. 
Then again, use Details section in the bottom to check.

The miner does not necessary has these 10k 1+ transactions in their mempool. Their mempool might simply have a restriction. So, from their perspective, they took all available transactions and did their best.
