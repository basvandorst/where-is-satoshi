The US sanctions by imposing trade restrictions with those who trade with the countries they sanction. Don’t be so full of yourselves. It’s not the trading with the US that damages sanctioned countries, but being unable to trade with anyone at all, because otherwise they wouldn’t trade with US. That’s how it worked for Cuba. Same thing with Venezuela. Pretty dirty game.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:46:02
I was more talking about the fact you mention that Venezuela can’t feed his own population and so on...

Your effort to try to attack me personally again is fruitless. In South America several countries failed under capitalism including: Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, Uruguay, Venezuela and Ecuador. Those countries’s left governments were taken down by coup d’etats financed and planned by the CIA and the US government. But there’s nobody blinder than he who doesn’t want to see. Next personal attack will mean a block.

Now criticizing the ultra rich and the fact that most didn’t get there through merit or hard work but clientelism and inheritance is equal to being a socialist? As if being a socialist were something pejorative. Limiting inheritance is definitely not something unique to socialism. But anyway, you keep your ideas for yourself. I will keep mine. Time will tell who’s right. Oh wait! Capitalism has shown to fail historically time and time again. Maybe it’s time for a UBI.

You mean the shitty jobs in some warehouse earning shitty money and being fired for unionizing? Let’s be realistic. Look at the data. The world needs UBI for mankind to get to the next level. It would help the environment, reduce violence, increase education, the average IQ of humans (yes we are smarter when we have money)... it would be THE BEST that has happened mankind ever.
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:32:57
How retrograde can you be? I am smart, yes, thank you. Most likely smarter than you. And no, I don’t have a problem giving the same amount to everyone including those that will be taxed. Money from people that earned it? You mean all those bankers by inheritance earned it? The ultrarich are mostly rich by inheritance. Are you joking me? Please stop replying. Read the article if you want, if not keep your ideas but stop posting pro-capitalist conservative stupidity, cause it hurts the eyes.

Hahahahhaha 5-8 million smiles I guess you mean. And yes, they should go to everyone that needs it. Your son, fortunately, has had an education and access to a relaxed stressless living thanks to growing up in non-poor environment. But what am I gonna tell you? You know better. In the end the majority will decide and you will have to do what the majority decides, or buy yourself an island with your 5-8 million smiles and live alone there.
Failed capitalism examples: South America, the majority of ex-soviet bloc countries, Libya today, most African countries. If you consider Western countries as capitalist you are way wrong, nanny states are not capitalism like you want/think it, they rescue banks, subsidize industries and give grants, guide the economy and impose tariffs, that’s all very socialist. Ah! And I don’t support any corrupt politicians and I don’t need/want your money, so keep straw men away.

You need to see it logarithmic and not arithmetic. 15x increase from 4$ to 60$ is easiernto achieve than increase from 2500$ to 5000$ since the amount of money you need to pour in the system is much bigger...

Absolutely. Wallet of Satoshi and Breez are however pretty nice wallets. And definitely Zap once they release the iOS version with integrated node will be awesome. But people are still holding Bitcoin too much and are not willing to spend much I have the feeling.

Trump is an egolatric, xenophobic asshole. Wake up. A guy that laughs at rally assistants proposing to shoot immigrants at the border? Trump is dangerous for the US and the world.
Craig Wright was dangerous for Bitcoin. Now that he has lost this case, he’s a bit less dangerous as he will lose influence on the community.

Dude that twitter post is cockey macho shit by some random guy, trying to show his dick is longer than the other guy’s dick. I am sick and tired of this kind of angry attitude in this scene. 
Also literature and scientific scrutiny is the only way to prove an argument. “It cannot get rid of the COO” or your sharding argument don’t prove or show anything. 
Nano’s limit to tx/s is based on hardware and bandwith limitations which are anyway a decade away. For me they work as of now better (specially Nano) as a payment system. 
IOTA is partnering with a lot of big industry players like Bosch and I don’t think those guys are stupid and would invest their time and money in technology that is shit.
Bitcoin is sexy too but it also has its flaws. For example today I paid 0.06$ to make a fucking transaction of 470$. That’s shit man, every single other network would have been much cheaper.
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:47:49

Fucking hell, this stupid argument again and again and again.
You have a bank. It rips us off and it’s a cancer for society. But you have one. 3 Billion people in this world don’t. That’s one reason. 
Secondly: your bank robs you and others so much, they can have a 1800 number, that will help you because THEY CONTROL YOUR MONEY. With Crypto, not just bitcoin, you are the bank. With insurance: THEY DECIDE WHAT CASES THEY PAY FOR. With smart contracts, it takes a little community effort, but a group of people with your same interest will decide if your case is legit or not, not a corporation with profit in their mind.
Stop talking the same childish simplistic arguments over and over again, please!

Agree, but what about NEM/XEM or other platforms with a great capacity to scale? Then maybe, Bitcoin was just the first but will die out as it's uncapable of managing the amount of transactions needed to be the money of the future. Me I like all my other assets more than Bitcoin, even if they're less profitable. Dash is quick, PIVX is awesome, NEM/XEM is an amazing platform, Monero is quick and anonymous... ZCash with all the critics is also better than Bitcoin as Digital Money. Decred is more democratic... and I could go on for ages. Bitcoin's value is derived from its name, from the fact that it's the first and most adopted/accessible coin, that even people I know, who wonder why they don't need to put their name somewhere in Jaxx Wallet and are afraid of losing the coins if Jaxx goes bankrupt, know about it and have bought it. But once the real life uses show impossible because of lack of scalability and transaction capacities, BTC and BCH will disappear in the depths of coinmarketcap :)

Right, I can buy anything with fiat... but with what fiat? And where? Because if you mean USD you can buy things in many places, but if you have other fiat currency, you won’t be able to buy much. We can ask Turkish, Venezuelans, Iranians and many other citizens of this world what they think.

It’s absolutely childish and an oversimplifaction, and probably even quite dumb to come to a Bitcoin Subreddit to say that Bitcoin will never be adopted, as an absolute assertion, because your bank offers you those things.

What kind of stupid obvious argument is this? The world was once run by slavery, it didn’t make it good nor right! Fiat is inflationary, Bitcoin isn’t. Fiat is surveilled unless you use cash, bitcoin is much more difficult to trace. I don’t need permission to use my Bitcoin, unlike fiat.

As for the COO, time will show, but the intention to turn it off is clear for me at least.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:04:53
If you wanna use inflationary money for your day to day transactions, up to you. Inflation is good to spend money since it’s gonna lose value anyway. What about making money that doesn’t lose value, so you spend on what’s really necessary? Wouldn’t that slow down the “tumoral” growth of the economy? How about inflation affecting more the poor than the rich? You have your opinions and I have mine.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:13:17
Storing value in money is a waste? Says who? 
The point of inflationary money is stimulate investment AND spending.
Of course money is a store of value! It’s the only reason it exists in the first place! To store value so you can exchange it!

Yeah man, I am upvoting every single pf your comments, but either people are trolling or are just plain dumb. The only disadvantage of phone vs key is the battery thing, which is solvable by using RFID plus passcode or any other method. 
The way I see it people saying they’ve been into crypto since 2011 and never used their phones to pay anything, just shows how this community in many casea doesn’t use this tech for its original purpose, which was substitute physical money through a form of digital decentralized peer to peer currency. This basically implies using it on mobile devices as you would use cash. But maybe I am wrong...
@_date: 2019-04-26 08:16:57

The King of France (an absolute king) sent you help to fuck with Britain (a parliamentary monarchy). The French spearheaded changes in the French Revolution and the 1830 and 1845 revolutions. The Paris Commune... 1968. But today the panorama looks different. All of those movements had very clear objectives. I am really afraid that those protesting today don’t really know what they want and have no real political principles but “fuck the system”. That gives Le Pen and her cronies the advantage. And that’s scary, as much Bitcoin as they start using.

The same people who come here to do the same thing but babbling much more stupid bullshit. Specially since those “lambo moonbois” arrived here last year trying to get rich by buying at 16000$. Really glad their money is in other pockets now.

Nah, Decred did that already and I also participate in that network.
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:14:10
That’s the fucking spirit! I bought at 300$ in 2015 and had mined for a while in 2013... bought, sold this and that. I could have sold in January and be “rich” but didn’t... do I give a fuck?? No, cause I was here from the beginning for the technology, because it’s great and it hits banks where it hurts them, it changes the game and if you wanna get rich quick or poke at people who bought expensive or didn’t sell at the right time you can go fuck yourselves. We are here for different reasons, not for egos and wealth.

I agree with you. Totally on point.

What the fuck are you talking about? What cult mentality, stupid? I recommended this person to do her due diligence and learn about blockchain before deciding anything. Explained I got in VERY early that's why the value of my investments grew, but lost stuff on the way. Is that reckless advice, asshole? Reckless advice she got from a professional banker sitting in a branch of a regulated bank that made her lose all the money her parents or grandparents had saved all their lives. Put on Bitcoin she would still have the Bitcoin at least no matter its value. And you say are sorry for her... get the fuck out of here...
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:25:37

@_date: 2019-01-15 12:07:43
Hey! Cut the disrespect and don’t be an asshole. I’ve been involved with bitcoin since 2013 and I understand perfectly how it works. However I see other techs which are more efficient and scalable than bitcoin and those techs cannot be incorporated on bitcoin. Watch history and see how technological advance is made and how first movers get substituted with time.
The fee for a lightning transaction that you just calculated is variable and the lightning network has many other disadvantages and criticisms.
Respect other people’s opinions and don’t come here to talk some “truth” and call other people ignorant because their view doesn’t agree with yours. Cause THAT is extremely ignorant and stupid.

I am happy seeing this post, but the whole Lightning Network was sold one and a half years ago as something super smooth and easy. 
The more I read about how it works, the more I think it’s a pain in the ass. Bluewallet seems to have done a good job at facilitating, but it seems that a lot of trust needs to be deposited in them, since they are running the lightning hub and node and paying your invoices then deducting the funds from a top up wallet. Correct me if I am wrong. 
Wouldn’t it be easier to just use one of the low TxFee alternative coin with a different tech or just one of those without any TxFees at all?? (I don’t wanna shill other coins) I love Bitcoin, been around since 2013... but damn... this feels like patching something that doesn’t work as intended and losing the essence of it.

Dumb reply. Germany has tons of government owned corporations, like DHL, Deutsche Bahn, Telekom... and they aren’t remotely as corrupt. The problem is a lack of functioning institutions and a tradition of corruption in South America inherited from the Spanish past, another country utterly corrupt, with half of the PP party (right wing grandsons and granddaughters of the Franco dictatorship rulers) implicated in at least one corruption case.

Your opinion is based on nothing but your belief that Bitcoin is superior. I think it’s not. And again tell me that I don’t understand what it is about. Who the fuck you think you are to even think you can grasp what I understand and what I don’t understand. If you can’t accept someone’s opinion without throwing ad hominem and argue in a respectful way which I have already noticed you cannot, the conversation ends and there’s nothing I wanna discuss with you.

@_date: 2019-01-12 18:51:39
Your point about the tragedy of the commons is quite good. That’s why other protocols like Decred solve this elegantly by incentivizing nodes through hybrid PoS/PoW? Or should the whole network best move to PoS like Ethereum and is doing and so many Smart Contract blockchains have(Tezos and Cardano come to my mind)?

You are not verifying the blockchain yourself unless you are solving the blocks yourself, you are just trusting the most consensuated chain, that means you need to trust that no single party controls 51% of the hashrate. So how do you fully verify the whole ledger yourself as a user? I don’t think your argument really supports itself.
@_date: 2019-01-30 14:35:55
Which is what the tech was all about since the beginning. Be your own bank. Use smart contracts and be a little bank, insurance company or any of the other abusive institutions of this world. That way they disappear and we live in a better more fair world.

I got asked today at work how to move part of her savings to Crypto. She lost her inheritance in some SBC (swedish bank I think) real estate long term investment that went to hell. She got 10% back. I was actually telling her, I always save my money in Cryptos... never bank nor cash, they both are more likely to get lost. She was almost crying remembering how the savings of her dead relative was vaporized... Therefore this ��
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:20:20
Because coin mixing is not coded in the protocol, it’s a trick which costs fees to make the coins less traceable. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:32:11
That’s not gonna happen... 
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:49:25
Yeah if she would have asked me as she did now, I would have said “don’t buy now, cause this is a bubble”. Anyway there are stablecoins that allow you to use crypto, but without the price swings (DAI, TrueUSD... ).
EDIT: and of course she would still have her coins, which might be lower value today, but if history recurs, they will recover their value in the next 2-3 years. She lost the 90% forever with no option for recovery.

I think it’s your last sentence plus that smartphones make a lot of powerful people rich and Bitcoin was an underground thing until 2013-14... and then it was in a bear market until last year. If banks could make money out of crypto and not lose power, we would have seen tons of adoption already.

The incentive is that to get your transaction you need to solve two other transactions as far as I understand. And as far as I understood DAGs don’t need a centralized validation. But maybe you can point to literature where those points you mention are discussed.

@_date: 2019-01-31 10:18:25
I don’t think they had any chance. It was an irrational bull run. I think however, that projects like Monero, Nano or IOTA are very interesting alternatives for payments. Specially Nano and IOTA being DAG based, makes them feeless and that’s very interesting. I know you will say IOTA has a coordinator but the objective is to eliminate it. I think the future of DLTs is brilliant and hope that all of them achieve great things, but I don’t put all my hopes into one solution only.
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:27:00

I think this question is legitimate. But it does reassure me and I guess others too in our idea that blockchain tech in general and crypto in particular is the future and will prevail. I will be buying more however only when BTC is at 3-4k. And I hope it really gets there.

This is the kind of post that shows how the herd behaves. All signals indicate a major correction, yet people think this is “300” and you got to stay in line. 
Don’t be a bagholder, sell at the peaks and rebuy when it’s lower. If you see a parabolic increase of 70% in 4 days, think that maybe it’s gonna correct hard and make your decision based on it. Do you need fiat soon? Sell some. Do you wanna buy something? Use bitcoin now, it’s a great time.

Fiat money is hard to get and decreases in value over time and if in a bank it can be blocked or devaluated. Bitcoin cannot and you control it with your private keys. If people would understand that, they would keep their money in Bitcoin rather than in Fiat Money.

Some markets change trend following the slight slope up "accumulation" period. Some other don't. They just double bottom and it's "trend reversal time". Others just "hang man" trend reverse... it's just not always the same.

@_date: 2019-05-22 13:26:55
Sorry but this has nothing to do with banks. I have in the past made wrong payments to companies and once the money is on their account they could keep it if they wanted and my bank can do fuck shit about it. I was paying invoices with my company’s account and they are providers and partners, but if the money is gone, it’s gone. In this case Huobi has no need to keep his Bitcoin. I also don’t think there’s a legal  case either.

Well even though I agree with you about trigger happy FUD screamers, your comment above is stupid.
