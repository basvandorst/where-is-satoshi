Definition is 
“An "on purpose, kinda" misspelling of "hold" - first coined in the altcoin sphere in 2013 &amp; later said to imply "Hold On for Dear Life". It reinforces the financial concept that you don't sell in a Bear Market. You ride it until the bitter end, or the price comes back up. (Hint: Crypto prices usually comes back up.)”

I was speaking more in cryptocurrency in general. With nicehash I get paid out in btc so I didn’t know if it would affect my mining rates

With this price fall and me mining does that mean I’m making more money with the dip or less money?
