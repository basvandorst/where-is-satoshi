Wanted to repost this guide on how to buy and sell cryptocurrency without fees. It's helped me a ton and I wanted to pass it on to anyone who may have not seen it. Keep your margins!

Depending on what platform you did it on, you may lose the coins that you sent. Some platforms have a minimum amount that they'll try to retrieve for you. Quote from bittrex below: "In some circumstances we may be able to retrieve these coins.  If you sent your coin to a different coin's address you'll need to submit a ticket telling us the coin name, the address you sent the coin to, the transaction id (txid), and the amount of coins sent.  This type of deposit mistake can take over 2 weeks to be credited."

Quit your job and trade bitcoin as your new job. Problem solved.

I'm not sure - does it not let you perform the same actions?
