Im just scared that when Bitcoin hits a specific price people gonna mass sell everything. It's gets harder at each price point
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:19:56
wat ? einsteinium is worth shit
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:43:12
Watch out for tax
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:45:18
Kinda wanna live in japan with their beautiful nature and temples. I'll be more at peace, wish I was born there.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:04:11
Ofcourse it goes down, it's all relative.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:02:23
Explain yoself
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:03:54
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:19:36
True,  but in this case they dont have specific rules on crypto. Capital gains are not to be paid like in US. Speculation tax has been abolished years ago.
But if you act like a trader, you get taxed 33%
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:46:43
Well Money makes money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:24:14
Thanks for the advice, anyhow did you see IOTA rising like hell ? Massive pump ?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:42:05
I'd be surprised if it's even intact considering it's dated back till 2013 and under tons and tons of trash
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:16:25
Congratzz 5 million
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:52:25
With paper wallet u mean writing down the private key on paper, reset ledger, and sending btc to the ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:16:30
Seriously ?
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:46:57
How are you one of the best then ? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:58:42
Possible or it will shoot the price even higher
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:58:33
In belgium it's not taxed after u withdraw it after a year. US different
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:14:21
Let me get this straight so you can buy bitcoin and sell and buy but u pay taxes after withdrawing it to your bankaccount after a year.
Or you buy bitcoins and DONT trade and put it in bankaccount after a year
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:40:46
That's my plan.. now to buy one bitcoin. 2020 is a long way to go damn giving me heart problems
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:00:10
Yes, but U can also buy bitcoin on GDAX instead of buying it on coinbase having lower fees
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:17:00
CLA45 ? Congratssss
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:33:04
Why would it dip ? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:00:33
Kinda wondering if Satoshi is somewhat dissapointed. Alot of people don't even know what Bitcoin is and can do.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:10:42
I had the same question when btc was worth 50 and then 500 and then 1000 and then 5000 ...and look at me now, I can say it's a good time, it may go down a bit but surely it will go higher anyways.. But that's a what if question.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:50:18
BTC crashes to 5000
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:07:15
Any good altcoins to invest ?
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:27:03
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:08:10
Damn it they just can't stay with their currency &gt;:3
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:03:08
What if it never dips. Its a gamblr
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:34:25
Constructing something worth 75 million dollar to find hard drive with 75 million dollars
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:00:37
Quantum computers but they are decade away by
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:59:25
Lets see what happens at 18 december
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:55:58
Or smashed by 1000 tons of garbage
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:37:05
Basically saying there is no specific rules about crypto, and sort of in a grey zone. Meaning if you act like a trader (How would they know?) you get taxed 33% but there is no capital gain tax unlike USA. But if you buy bitcoin and HODL for a specific amount of time (Vague, so it can be a year or six months..) you dont need to pay taxes.. sort of.
Its all very vague
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:38:05
How would they even know ? I mean if you trade day in and day out and after a year withdrawing it to the bank, how would they know u been trading ?
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:26:34
What about einsteinium or cardano ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:30:41
Correction is happening as we speak
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:43:36
Why not altcoins like ETH ?
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:41:13
What is more profitable hodl or trading. If i trade its 33 pervent tax of the profit while if I hodl its zero
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:49:30
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:17:46
Don't think about it too much man, I know it's hard and you are not the only one. But see it this way, it's never too late and it's still early.. Alot of of people who bought it in the early days also probably sold it at a certain price.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:01:22
Still a whaf if scenario
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:53:20
Wow, you are really unlucky. Contacting the police is always a must with a theft. And police is probably the only help u can get, hopefully they won't know what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:52:10
You in for the money or the technology ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:28:49
Not perse depends on the markets
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:21:20
Lightning Network will help alot.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:41:52
How would they know I mean they will only know if the money is getting deposited into the bank ? So I think taxation will apply if you putting money into the bank all the time no ?
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:30:29
Causing a snowball effect with everyone selling. Lets be honest majority think bitcoin as an investment and not because of the technology
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:55:49
More trustworthy than coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:43:42
Yes you can use your seed and buy another ledger and it will restore. My question is when forgetting seed but knowing pin, can u make a new seed ?
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:02:55
Welp you are right, better find me some new promising altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:56:12
Everything that's digital is good for Japan, they are far ahead than the rest of countries, they have vending machines on every corner of everything
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:16:12
Until you convert dollars to BTC you have 0 btc. How bout dah
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:42:19
Yes that would stop the crashing.. now if everyone cashed out like you did. It would stabilize.... 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:37:07
I don't want something called sweatcoin ugh
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:25:28
Yeah I just saw it its a recent article. But i wonder if I trade bitcoin in and out and put it on my bank after a year. How would they know? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:47:55
If u can afford to make a spelling mistake "Lightening Network" then it's a no go
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:22:58
Kinda interested in getting 1 bitcoin, but I am overthinking so much it's not normal reading alot of articles and watching the price go up and down
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:51:20
U sure u on the right sub ?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:18:23
True, imagine 10000 and rapidly crashes down to 500. You still hodl ? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:17:31
Yes, kinda wrong on my side, I mean when your money is not sitting at the exchange and everything happens fast
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:35:19
Yeah right
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:56:21
They will also be able to break banks
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:52:12
LOL if you think this is a dip, embrace yourself
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:04:52
And what specials skills u have to be able to find it
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:29:45
Now or wait and take the gamble
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:13:54
ggodamn it too late :(
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:58:20
Big gamble right there sigh
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:53:38
Haha, if you withdrawing amounts less than 10000. Withdraw higher and it's automatically passed to the IRS. 
It's complicated matter, I read that if u try to withdraw large amount of money after a year. You need to get a "ruling" with a financial laywer just to make sure that they won't do nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:17:46
AlternatCoins hodlers jumping ship, just look at the rest of crypto all down by a lot
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:12:04

@_date: 2017-12-03 22:59:10
Iota is rising as hell man
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:33:26
Basically if you hodl and dont participate in trading, it's tax free ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:59:14
What if have old pc will I still have the same chance with ones that have a super computer
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:51:08
So transferring as soon as possible ? Is it instant ? Btw does it go directly from coinbase to usb hardware wallet, or is it first saved on computer. (PS: Is it true that if you buy bitcoins u need to wait 10 days before u have it)
Thank youuuuuuuu very much for being helpful btw &lt;33
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:44:25
There is no point in buying low and selling high if in the end you gotta pay 33% tax for it anyways
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:59:47
Baby go down, and stay there. Payement verification pending so I can't buy
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:24:01
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:05:57
I need the dip so badly
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:43:07
Belgium is 33% That's just filthy theft ? Godamn it, this is important shit right here
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:35
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:25:44
No, I won't listen to you!
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:17:51
You could buy a used bugatti for that price.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:04:56
What for european users? Belgium?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:41:02
Is that the limit order thing at GDAX ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:53
FUD, someone wanna buy low
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:39:50
Wanting to buy first bitcoin, but also waiting for a dip. got migraine
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:44:54
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:47:42
Why the hell would it crash
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:26:51
You won't be able daytrade anyways when Wall Street is going to mingle in. They will eat u alive
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:53:55
Beginner too, but important thing I learned is that you need to transfer from Coinbase to GDAX and from GDAX to wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:12:17
Mining is too late, buying bitcoins not. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:22:10
Lol, typical morocco, they want all the money and don't wanna have shit they can't control
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:56:04
jimmies are rustled
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:51:40
And if it doesn't happen ? Well, still a gamble tho
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:21:24
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:04:22
One bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:35:57
Same for belgium, if you hold it for more than a year no taxes need to be paid off. Kinda wanted to get into trading but with 33% taxes I don't know if it's worth
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:34:38
Just looked it up, essentialy if you are just HODLING and don't buy/sell. It's taxfree
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:57:12
can =/= going to
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:47:48
Is it worth trading if in the end u need to pay tax if you convert it to fiat
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:14:51
Now in english ? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:38:27
What about non-american users ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:34:19
Pretty sure 11k is already reached
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:55:11
It's the same I think, if you got an account with GDAX u also get an account at coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:25:42
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:42:05
Yeah naw
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:27:01
I heard tommorow they are going to air episode about bitcoin on big bang theorh which will flood it even more
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:16:47
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:46:21
Episode ends with a massive bitcoin crash as a moral example that money isn't everything but your friends and family.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:00:31
Why is it a bubble ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:12:46

@_date: 2017-11-29 23:02:13
What about non-american citizens ?

Fuck me, he predicted it right. Maybe really from the future ;/
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:31:33
