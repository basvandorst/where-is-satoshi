like 10$ can get you in trouble, depend of the humor of the national guard officer that day.

that's a crime in vzla, you can go to jail if you travel outside the country with hundreds in cash so.

Since the dictator "open" the exchange market (only the way in), normal citizen are using their visa/master cards to buy goods when the black market (or grey, im not sure the shade anymore) exchange rate drops below the fixed rate from the BCV (Venezuelan Central "Bank"), also, most of them (the "enchufaos" or "power plugged") use is dollars in cash, this week a group of people enter the house of the son of a official and ransack various bags of USD, when you see the video you understand the level of corruption in my country.
I think BTC will prevail in vzla in the next republic, but when power fails (more than before, waaaay more), you can get kill just for show a mid-range smartphone, most of the mobile data coverage is slow or inexistent connection to internet, nothing that requires power works.
I don't know tomorrow, or the day after, but today? I think (without evidence), that this sanction can hurt directly more to a (practically non-existent) honest mid class than a "enchufao".

that would be terrible for my family,
i think that you guys are reading wrong the situation with money in vzla.
@_date: 2016-12-30 23:46:00
Sorry, but as Venezuelan, you are wrong.
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:42:46
There's ignorance about Bitcoin in the street and government doesn't like people having freedom of money exchange so, there's that, outside of the country, many Venezuelan have only Bitcoin and surbitcoin to send money to their family so they can buy food at exorbitant prices without having big loses in the black market exchange and the few that have knowledge about BTC inside the country that have savings in VEB can save the monetary value of that saving without having to fight to buy black market USD and exchange back to VEB when is necessary, so, if you ask me, as Venezuelan, with all the knowledge that I have about BTC and Venezuelan economy, yes, I would put my savings in BTC, even if the BTC lose 10% in one week, VEB lose more than that in a day in the black market.

Are you crazy Ramon? 
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:29:34
Thanks, I live in Panama, but my family is still there, the thing is that the is no food shortages anymore, but, the price of the food is impossible to pay for the minimal wage worker, their dependence from the government food subsided package is the only way to live, and don't get me started with medicine, there is a saying that's like "it's ugly for the picture" that means there is an ugly future here.
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:35:38
Nothing, absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:43:34
Now, there are cash shortage and the ATM of many banks only let you take 10000Bsf a day, for example, a big Mac is 46000. And that forces people to only use PoS to buy things, the things is, many of the food and transportation only accept cash, so, a new business is to sell you cash at 15-30% rate.
