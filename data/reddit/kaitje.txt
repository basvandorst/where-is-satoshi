I am always very skeptic about these "researches". "Do you believe Bitcoin is a scam?", "Would you recommend this deodorant to your friends?" The probable answer lies often in the question itself. People are steered towards a certain answer. If you would ask people "What do you think Bitcoin is?" Do you still think 62% of the people would mention the word "scam"? I think not.

Although I was not aware of this, I disagree with your "better safe than sorry". If 40 people out of 15.000 do not have proper security measures on their pc, then this is a business risk for banks. They should have accounted for that (and they do in other occassions, such as creditcard fraud and phishing). It is not OK to dupe the other 99.7% of transactions, because buying bitcoins is anonymous. In my case, I even had to leave my mobile number to start the transaction and was still blocked. I think banks are trying to minimize Bitcoin transactions by saying that these are "insecure".

Similar story: I recently bought 2.4 BTC for my dad via iDeal (An online payment service with collaboration of all Dutch banks). Only to find out later that my iDeal payments were blocked. The error page asked me to call the bank (ING) and I was referred to the Fraude-department..... Because "They would like to talk to me". The fraude-department guy told me "someone" was using my account to buy Bitcoins, so I told him that someone was me, obviously. They froze my account because for my protection, because someone else could use it to buy Bitcoins ??!! After this conversation they unfroze it, so I could buy the Bitcoins. I think the banks are only fuelling the fire with this kind of actions, it only strengthens me in my believe that the way banks operate now has no future.

Haha, I did not know of that site. Thanks for pointing me to it. It think my idea differs in some aspects. 1. As I understand it you have to be the last bidder to gain the price with quibids, this makes it more of a gambling game than my idea, with quibids investing more does not directly increase your chance of getting the item. 2. With quibids, every time a new bidder enters a bid, the clock is increased with 20 seconds. This is a way to drive the price up. In my idea, the price and time are fixed to give everyone a fair chance. 3. I think quibids is interesting for commercial sellers more than your "average joe" seller. My idea is focused on gaining Bitcoin attention to the masses. If you don't want to buy Bitcoins directly, maybe you have some stuff laying around that you can sell to obtain Bitcoins. Well, in theory, that's the idea.

Funny, but I expected the green guy to be a dollar. That would have added an extra layer to the sex-change: Dollar wants to be a Bitcoin ;)

Yes, I have got my money out. They process the withdrawals manually, so you have to be a little patient.

No problem, I must say they could do a bit better on the communication front......
