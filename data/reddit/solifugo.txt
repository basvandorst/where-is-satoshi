Do you know any "One click" tutorial?
found this:
But not 100% if this is what needs more tests (still trying to get some concepts right...)
I hope to have a server to test soon!!!
btw, will the free amazon aws works for this? since is not mining, should be ok right?

A lot of people excited about their new coins and maybe not fully aware of how seed works can get into this scam

I dont think anybody will exactly know, but as mentioned, Litecoin (as many other) follows Bitcoin really close.. so you may want to check other altcoins for low value but that can spike in a biggest percent. But dont go crazy, you can reserve 5-10% of your portfolio to "these games". If your intention is to hold.. I think is always good to go to safer coins :)
The good thing about these other altcoins, is that they can be easier to mine (I noticed you asked about that as well) and you wont need special equipment (at least to start...) since they dont need ASIC CPU.
I know this is "bitcoin" sub, but I recommend you to check monero/vertcoin to see how to mine them (I read something about "1 click miner" for vertcoin, which sounds like a good start, even if you dont get profits, at least makes the start easier) and that way you will learn more ways to use blockchain technologies.. and who knows if getting some profit :P
If you are still thinking about bitcoin mining, check  but is expensive and please be careful, as far as I know, they are not "user friendly"...
Remember that this is just the beginning... Bitcoin and other coins can go south and disappear, who knows.. but Im 99% sure blockchain technology will survive and be use to thousand of other applications.
Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, Samsung... all big companies are checking very closely the crypto world and some of them will apply to their products (they have their own teams and even applications in development based on them). 
It doesn't mean they will get attached to any of the current coins.. but Im sure they will put in use some of the created protocols, so anything you learn now, can help you in the future (if you like the technology, of course)

That is my understanding as well, so I don't know how that will affect bitcoin price

PPI... every.single.day...
The best one though is "we have in our records that you have had a recent car accident...."
Never got a bitcoin one yet... Now I should start answering the phone every time!!

Ohh, cool.
I'm getting a new server soon and one of the things I need to do is to learn docker and it works.
Thanks for the link!

I think that will be still risky... they will know where the money comes from, so they can make the decision to freeze the account "for security reasons"...
Dont you have anything like Revolut/Monzo there to use as "second" account?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:56:40
How will affect it?
Genuinely confused about all of this.
Tried to understand futures with oil and other stuff.. But I don't see how can affect the price of bitcoin..

If the disk never got full after formatting it, you still have some option, since normally you don't delete info, just mark it as "deleted" since it is much faster (unless you use "slow format option)
Check recovery software options, even ask in some forums if you need to.. But don't mention is crypto or money related.. Just your old teenage poems..
If the file was just a txt, won't be too difficult to try to recover all txt and do some searching on them
But first, get the recovery software and don't do anything else on that disk/pc
Edit: Never tried it, but this is the idea 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:59:26
Will do, thx!

Well, nice until the android app stop working...
No sure why, the mobile website works, but the app is not able to show me anything... 
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:19:39
That was a bit random.... 
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:27:19
Ok, looks like app is now back... But, you made me read some stuff about coinbase that I'm not sure about.. I guess there are guides everywhere.. But how can I get an external wallet and how much will it cost?
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:58:47
Hahaha, that's my experience. I show her some charts from time to time and some videos.. But she only cares about how much we can get on few years 
To be fair, the only think I care about when she is making soap, is that she doesn't poison the cats, so we just don't share 100% of our hobbies, and that is fine

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but if I topped up with 0.1btc I have today 15% more minutes? (15% being the bitcoin price increase "today")

Be careful, coinbase (and I guess others) will close transactions for few days just before and after the fork, so you may miss the dip. Not sure if any trading portal will allow you to get them safely, sorry
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:20:43
Well you can use alternatives and not sure if other exchanges will allow you to get them... But I just wanted to clarify about coinbase, which is the one most people use to start with bitcoin (including me there)
To be honest, I think the situation looks risky in multiple ways, for users and exchanges (looks like this fork will be different than the one which created bitcoin cash and could cause issues) so people should be careful about buying during those days

Ledger (alternative to trezor) supports btc/bch/eth/VTC/ltc.... and soon monero
I think trezor is similar, you just "install" different wallet apps..

Hehehe, I like it

Yep, I'm thinking about ordering already, since looks like takes some time to get home...
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:29:27
And monero is coming soon!!! ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪
