dude it freaked me out, that time traveler thread said it would break 10k before 2017 ends, if it breaks 100k by 2019 and 1million by 2021 I will really start freaking out about that thread lol Especially since when I happed in it was only 700 and two months before 2017

Or a shrimp boat captain can invest in bitcoin, buy all the shrimp boats with all the profits, buy more bitcoin with the shrimp boat monopoly profits on top of selling shrimps for bitcoin and become shrimp boat-bitcoin king.
*In essence why doesn't bitcoin's fiat currency hodlers/bankers(Where-ever the money is held) exchange that money for gold, that way bitcoin is literally held by the gold standard, free of the depreciation of the fiat dollars it is currently standing on. It would be ~~stable as fuck~~ A hell of a lot more stable after it's free from the worlds fiat value drops. Otherwise, I fear[ we become this level]( of schizophrenically mad if we remain tied to the depreciation doomed fiat currency market as our backbone.*

That will cost you 1000 bitcoins sir, per inch ;)
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:12:32
Okay, just open up your wallet wide and drop it into mine.

Take that chart a couple month back and you'll realize you should be celebrating because it's still up. This is just a discount before it breaks a new celling. Robinhood is about to bring 5 millions new buyers to the market without fees. And stock market buyers non the less so these guys buy a lot more than us. They will blow it up in a matter of days after they integrate it into their system.

I'll never sell. Even if I had got in that cheap. My investment mind has always been that what I'm buying now is for 40 year old me.

Haha silly past human. ~~I came here from 2051 and I have never seen a dollar or heard of one used in my life till I came back here to buy my family a fortune.~~

Daddy? Can you buy me a bitcoin? I'll let you play Dr with me again if you do.
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:16:14
According to the biggest wallets in existence. Every wallet with 100k plus BTC is owned by some bank or financial institution.

oh man, i'd blown my brains out if I saw it at 10 dollars and didn't move on it.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:33:32
oh man, you should've moved on it! well if it sticks to it's pattern you should get another close oppertunity at 3k, probably 4k if anything.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:00:25
I'm not! I won't be sick till I've put in 10k and have over 100 thousand different type of coins! 
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:10:39
This comment made me buy more Bitcoin.

This is my second 70% correction dip. Hasn't fazed me after studying the chart. It will keep happening. In 4 years we'll be crying about dipping to 50k from 300k, and I'll be sitting back relaxing waiting for the next jump to 1 million. Oh and that one will be funny af, everyone crying about a million dipping down to 200k, then the pros will sit back and wait for the 10 mil jump.

3 digits is fine, just means I'll finally be able to get 21 bitcoins and join the real 21 million club.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:45:09
Before 1 bitcoin was the 21 million clubs, 21 bitcoins was the 21 million club.

Man, I miss the 700 days when I hopped in. Wish I would've bout 10 of those mother fuckers instead of just 7.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:50:33
This sounds too risky, and I don't have 1 bitcoin to give him :(

Hey, If I ever have time travel I already have the best play. When I started etherium was at 8 dollars. 2k info it would've been 140k 2 months later by january 2017, If I would've moved 100k into litecoin at that time when coinbase added it at 3 dollars then that 100k woul've been 1 billion by summer 2017. If anyone has a time machine, I know a me with the spare 2k to make these moves in summer of 2016. That me can make us all rich I just need to borrow a time machine.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:54:36
I don't have 1500, but if I succeed in my mission I promise to give you 10 million by summer of 2017
