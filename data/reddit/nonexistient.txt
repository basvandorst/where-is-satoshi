The truth is probably somewhere in between. TA is like self fulfilling prophecy. People follow it because they believe in it so it has some effect on the market. Some good news also helps here and other people follow the trend. It mix of everything but in the end no-one knows for sure..
I think it won't be that easy to establish new ATH, around 19k price tag people might start selling because lot of people got burned back then in 2017 so they might be afraid situation repeats
