What the fuck kind of cucked our anti freedom shit is this? Why would Twitter be the standard?
@_date: 2019-03-05 19:30:06
Whether or not there are backdoors, people will be pressured to block and not associate with “bad people”. Just like on twitter and all other social media. People are already locked out of the Cash App for being conservative. This guy will do the same thing with Lightning network one way or another.

That is literally happening with QE.
They don’t just print up money and hand it out to people. They buy real assets with it. It’s like they’re buying gold with Monopoly money. This is called the Cantillon Effect. Look into it
@_date: 2019-03-19 01:33:30
This is bullshit. QE continues to this day. They haven’t paid it all off. You’re talking about tarp. We’re almost on QE 5
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:05:06
Is there any proof of this? I’ve heard about a lot of people not being able to transfer money to the app...

He’s a programmer himself. If he is one of the money people involved, he’s going to have his say. Dude is a snake and it’s not good to have billionaire snakes working on the very first implementation of bitcoin. 
He doesn’t let conservatives is the Cash App. Why would his stance on this be any different?

Dude. In your mind, what causes inflation?
I answered your question now you answer mine. I said that I believe money printing creates inflation.


Inflation is when more money is added to the total supply, thus making the value of each dollar less over time. What do you think inflation is? 
@_date: 2019-03-14 22:40:05
I’d say QE causes the inflation. The fed literally has a monetary policy of adding money to the total supply in order to have that “controlled 2% inflation” you are citing (even though we all know it’s more than that).
If money printing doesn’t cause the inflation, what is causing it in your mind?
@_date: 2019-03-01 18:43:07

So you are now admitting that QE was the cause of the inflation of housing? Lol. Are you retarded? You just spent the last few comments arguing about how QE doesn’t cause inflation....
And you also keep using the term “massive”. Didn’t you just try to say QE wasn’t even responsible for 2.2%?

In the future, I want paper wallets with small amounts of saroshis on them. So the cashier can take my paper btc recripients, scan them and then reuse or throw them away. This way I can keep paper bitcoins in my wallet
