LOL you are naive if you do not think the same techniques are being used by investment bankers to manipulate the bitcoin market and there is absolutly nobody to stop them and who can blame them? It's like stealing candy from a baby.
By the way how much money have you lost "investing" in bitcoin so far?

Why should I make an effort to use my cryptocurrency hoard when I can just buy things with fiat? You know how normal people do. Also fiat is an inflationary currency so buying stuff with it or investing it makes sense. Buying stuff with crypto can wait.

Or have a trusted NGO audit your finances.

And sometimes people go to jail when they are caught manipulating a regulated market. No need to hide in the free bitcoin market, you can manipulate it in broad daylight and laugh all the way to the bank.

You can if you export those coins. It is probably illegal to smelt/use as scrap US coins in the US - as you are doing it for profit you wouldn't be protect by the right to free speach as would a demonstrator or an artist destroying US coins.

Better call the authorities... oh wait the authorities don't care :)

"HSBC Mexico, a Mexican subsidiary that has nothing to do with the United States"
What in this sentence do you not understand?
HSBC has it's headquaters in London. What the fuck does a Mexican branch of an English bank has to do with the USA?

Then give the phone away for free or sell it very cheap but only under the condition that the new owner won't buy any apps from Apple.

I am betting more if between the time I sell my crypto and re-buy it the price goes up. The crypto exchanges keep getting closed down so I would rather keep my crypto safe on my computer.

By the same logic you should buy property in North Korea. Some day that property will be worth much more.

And that matters because... 
Did you even read that article?


HSBC USA is prosecuted by the US judges for violating US laws on US soil.
USA has 0 jurisdiction over the actions of HSBC Mexico in Mexico.

Let's say I'm betting on bitcoin rising in value but I'm not prepared to bet more. Never bet on cryptocurrencies more then you can lose. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 18:55:34
I don't know. I never tried it. I'm hoarding cryptocurrencies on my computers in the hope that thay will make me rich one day or at least I can sell them for the same ammount I have bought them. Just like the majority of the people here.

Wut? 
Cryptocurrencies are scammer heaven. Just ask moolah. Just invent a financial pyramid.... wait for it.... but with Bitcoin!^TM and the cryptos will come rolling in while nobody would fall for a scheme like that if they had to send some guy who nobody knows a substancial sum of actual money.

Why should I spend something that can be worth twice as much in a few months? Then I will be able to buy much more with the same number of bitcoin. It is in my best interest not to spend any bitcoin.

It matters that if Bitcoin fails and he is left holding a huge bag of Bitcoins then people will make fun of him for the rest of his life. His reputation is worth to him much more then the Bitcoins he is holding.

It will be dead or a totaly irrelevant penny crypto run as somebody's hobby. 
It is only traded on 5 exchanges and the Vault of Satoshi exchange is closing soon.

A central authority that intervenes and works against natural free market forces? A Keynesian! [grabs pitchfork] Burn him!
But seriously it's just the free market working as intended.

I do it for the lulz. Inteligent posts criticising bitcoin get downvoted and ignored anyway so why should I bother. Some serious faults can not be remedied so there is no use complaining about them anyway.
For example the lack of a central governing authority that could shut down crypto exchanges untill the markert cools down or sell bitcoin to avoid a bubble or buy bitcoins to avoid a crash is a serious probblem that cannot be fixed.  So relax and let me enjoy the tears of bitcoiner.

Actually wine does not age in bottles so 20 years from now your wine will be just 20 years older. Wine has to be aged in barrels to improve it's flavor.

had a distribution phase and people dumped as soon as they got the coins meaning that the price went down and more people dumped which killed the coin.

*Many individuals grew suddenly rich. A golden bait hung temptingly out before the people, and, one after the other, they rushed to the tulip marts, like flies around a honey-pot. Every one imagined that the passion for tulips would last for ever, and that the wealthy from every part of the world would send to Holland, and pay whatever prices were asked for them. The riches of Europe would be concentrated on the shores of the Zuyder Zee, and poverty banished from the favoured clime of Holland. Nobles, citizens, farmers, mechanics, seamen, footmen, maidservants, even chimney sweeps and old clotheswomen, dabbled in tulips*
The Tulipomania", Chapter 3, in Mackay 1841.
