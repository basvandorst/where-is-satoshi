Well, theoretically yes. In practice, probably too. But still it is 32 times harder to flood blockchain with 32MB blocks.

Well, tbh, looking on recent activities, especially on alternate coins, it is quite easy and cheap to flood the network with transactions. Especially when BTC's block capacity is few times smaller than other.
Anyway, I am looking forward to see how this is going to be solved.

Well, it is just stupid. In our case I told people to use other options to test if our system is working ok. It's ideal case why bitcoin have such a bad press recently. 
Few of my colleagues already asked me "What if something similar happen on mainnet? Will we be able to receive payments?"

So one cannot say even a good thing about btc without being judged as bch supporter?

Tell me then, how did you count it? Let's say, that I correctly estimate a few based on previous txs

Interesting. I didn't find any transaction during these day which transfer such a big amount of bitcoins. Do you have a hash of it? Maybe I missed something.
// edit. Found it but on different day. Currently it will cost 20$ to send it. Fee is now something like 30sat / byte.

 this is telling me, that 30sat is the cheapest fastest. Let's just assume that they are right. Bitcoin saw worst times :)
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:55:43
Are you able to multiply?
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:59:35
I think you overestimate this like... A lot.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:56:05
How is that related to bcash? Isn't that confirmation how btc is good?
