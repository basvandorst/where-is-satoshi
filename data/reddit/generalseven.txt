It sounds like Amex is trying to file a patent for our service. What should we do?
[US Patent 20140006297 filed on July 2, 2013:](
    An integrated, end-to-end, automated system that
    enables a first social networking user to seamlessly
    transfer value to a second social networking user, even if
    the second user is not registered with the money transfer
    service from which the first user initiates the transfer..."
Our service:
*Send Bitcoins to anyone on Twitter, as easy as a Tweet!*
PikaPay is a Bitcoin wallet integrated with the Twitter API and is one of the fastest and easiest ways to use Bitcoin. Just like in the Amex patent, with PikaPay the recipient doesn't need to have a PikaPay account to receive bitcoins.
We were the first to start sending bitcoins on Twitter back in 2011. But we're sure that scores of other companies have been doing "value transfer via social networks" even earlier.
Do we have to take that Amex patent application seriously in any way, and is there anything specific we should do?

I get your anger.  But do the politicians have a good plan either way?
The point is this:
Don't the dollar, euro, UK pound and other traditional currencies seem politically compromised -- from all sides of the political spectrum?  Decentralized digital currency seems to offer an interesting alternative...

I didn't specifically say anyone has "earned" it in the way you mean.
As for risk, there is a clear mathematical way to define it in this context: volatility is risk.  Anyone who continues to hold an asset while its price is volatile is taking on the risk.  According to economic theory, the higher the risk, generally the higher the reward.

We've heard some protests about having Craig Wright speak at our event, and while we may personally disagree with his positions, we don't see a reason to automatically blackball him because of them.  We will of course keep our neutrality.  We have no reason to believe that he is a serious threat to the industry.

1. As I understand it, side chains can already be implemented with a soft fork, though some (more complex) proposals would require a hard fork.
2. Again as I understand it, there's more complexity to RSK than the Lightning Network, and the latter is farther along.  There's also a sizable community who find the side chain architecture unappealing or even unnecessary when we already have Ethereum smart contracts, not to mention the many other smart contract platforms.

So be it!  Our aim is to cover the entire industry, not just selected parts of it.
Bitcoin Wednesday has had pre-crowd sale appearances by founders of:
Augur, Bancor, Cosmos, Ethereum, Factom, Flixxo, Gnosis, Grid+, Internet of Coins, LA Token, NapoleonX, Snip, Streamr, Wings...
But also a lot on Bitcoin itself, including Andreas Antonopoulos and Christian Decker on Lightning Network, Gabriel Kurman of RSK, etc.

It's called Bitcoin Wednesday out of deference to the de facto standard, most-proven, most-tested and very first blockchain, and we cover it too.
It turns out that the large majority of Bitcoiners / majority of people prefer to be educated about the whole industry, not just a narrow part of it.  And maybe people in The Netherlands don't get confused that easily.
