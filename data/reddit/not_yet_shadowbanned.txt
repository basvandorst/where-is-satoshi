We need bitcoin used for something wholesome. Like sending donations to funny internet nazis.

this happens to people in the west too. just over different things.

I bought at 11k in 2017. Just wait long enough and you will see a return on investment.

and if you did buy during those 14 weeks, just wait a while.

Use it as money, it exists as an alternative to fiat currency. This is more important than currency speculation. It has to become so prolific that the mega rich bankers can't afford to pump and dump it.

you guys make the magic happen. speculation can be fun, but what's important is making crypto a viable, non-shutdownable, currency. and getting more people do adopt it.

I wanted to buy the dip, that's literally what I said.

should be easy for you to name at least one then.

i missed it because of a problem with my exchange in my new country. never procrastinate goys. i'll still buy some at this price, even if it goes up.
more importantly than speculation is, of course, using it as a legitimate form of currency.

nothing has intrinsic value. everything only has value in context.

That would mean someone invents a better alternative. Bad news for anyone just speculating on Bitcoin, but for people in this for bigger reasons and speculators with a wider scope of interest this would not be bad news.

i agree, that as far as the US government, or any government issued currency. is concerned, it's all monopoly money.

we saw this coming with figures like andrew anglin, who has only been able to take bitcoin donations for over two years now. banned from all other funding avenues.
love him, hate him, or feel indifferent towards him, this is what's waiting for all dissidents at some point.

i never invest more than i can afford to lose, and when people freak out like this i assume it's time to buy. may dip even more though. who knows?
