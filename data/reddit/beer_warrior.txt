No bitcoin is best payment method. It only takes 15 minutes for the transaction to be verified. And if there is problem I don't need to use silly chargebacks. I get gift coupons instead. You must be dum dum to not understand the Benefits.

You want BTC to become mainstream? Then you'll need to solve for people like me that struggle with things like that. Here's hoping that the copy/paste errors fail the checksum.

More secure than Ft Knox? That's a joke. It's so easy to get someone's coins even a low level thug can do it. 
It's simple: You find a bitcoin holder and get a hammer and smash their fingertips until they give up their private key. Not rocket science.

Asinie shit? Half of the posts in this sub are about how bitcoin will need to be able to handle the US's 10 trillion dollar economy, and thus each bitcoin will *obviously* be worth a million dollars each in the near future.

You are correct, the jump from $80 to $260 occured in early 2013. This is when I started following Bitcoin.

I'm saying the bitcoin community is a bunch of suckers. Look at BFL. Look at mt gox. Any normal person would have looked at those scenerios and know that they were black holes for money. But the bitcoin community, blinded by idealism and promises and of easy profits, was easily suckered in. It's a virtually untraceable currency where transfers can't be reversed and you never really know who you're dealing with. 
But do what you want with your money. Invest in magic beans for all I care.

I'm not upset. I've made money in online poker, and lost it gambling on bitcoins. It's about a wash with me on digital money.
The point of my post is that I don't see a compelling reason why the price of bitcoin will rise, so I'm selling. It's the rational thing to do.
@_date: 2014-12-13 22:09:57
It doesn't concern you that bitcoin's largest exchange collapsed? Also the amount of signifant retailers that accept BTC remains countable on one hand.

Governments are "afraid" of Bitcoin because it can be used to launder money and avoid paying taxes. It's not a big conspiracy. It's the same reason that cash transactions over $10k have to be reported to the government via CTR. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 05:39:25
Bitcoin is fantastic for charities and donations like wikipedia and Save the Children. This is really where the currency is useful. The transaction is anonymous and secure, and no chargebacks are needed. The only downside would be if you needed a receipt for tax purposes. Not sure how that would work. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 20:57:08
Finally. Somebody who gets it. 
People keep talking about bitcoin "going viral" like all it needs is a given threshold of demand before it accelerates toward inevitability. The exact opposite happens. As demand increases the amount of infrastructure needed to meet the needs of users grows exponentially. Like any business supply curves move up and to the right with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 07:00:42
It's a consequence of the "get rich quick" mentality of many (most?) of the Bitcoin denizens. And the belief that we are building a utopia out of this technology.

@_date: 2014-12-24 06:22:07
Every single transaction in bitcoin is traceable. If bitcoin was the de facto currency of the US you couldn't buy anything without your employer knowing, since they would know the address you are paid into. I thought you all realized this. 
I bet cash looks pretty good right about now. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 02:57:04
You know, I hope you're right. But like you say, time will tell. Either way my interest in BTC stems from its influence in developing markets. I hope it can make a positive impact there. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:59:47


Honestly, if the Winklevoss twins haven't done it, I'm not going to. I think BTC adoption has plateaued. Like Linux desktop, it's a niche market and everyone who would use the technology has already heard of it by now. I think it's a cool technology and an interesting idea, but not something that will be broadly adopted by the masses. Simply because it really doesn't solve a problem for most people.

You know what homie? I've been on on this sub a long time, lurking through various usernames, so let me fill you in with how this goes:
Around every 6 months the Next Big Thing in BTC comes out, some kind of service or group. And they promise, through contracts and such, to bring accountability and stability to BTC. And people like you send them their BTC and they receive a "contract" and there are posts all over this sub about how the Next Big Thing will revolutionize BTC trading.
Flash forward 6 months, the proprieters of the Next Big Thing are nowhere to be found, and users (like yourself) are holding their "contracts" in the air, demanding accountability and the return of their assets. And for a lucky few it dawns on them that with an Anonymous Internet Currency people can't be held accountable in the end.
And so when you say "trust" I laugh and sigh and watch people lose money. So have fun, but don't say I didn't tell you so.

I don't think that the "no chargebacks" feature is sustainable. Consumers are accustomed to this functionality. I understand how it benefits the merchant, but consumer adoption is really the "X" factore here.
Keep in mind that credit cards don't really benefit the merchants. They're expensive, and kind of a pain in the ass. The reason for their high adoption rates is that they induce consumer spending. Bitcoin (currently) doesn't have that kind of draw.
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:46:13

That's my point. MS adopting BTC is treated as huge news. I don't shop with them so it doesn't help me much. Are we going to throw a party for each and every vendor that adopts BTC? If this thing was really taking off there would be dozens adopting per week.

Historically people have used Bitcoin to launder money and buy contraband. Until your libertarian utopia is established, any competent government would take issue with a payment system that facilitates this. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:21:24


So.... Trust means that I must "trust" people (anonymous people on the internet, no less!) to return my money when I errantly send it to them? 
Does this not seem like a bad way to structure business transactions to you? 


That's how insurance works. If everybody needed it all of the time, the system would be unable to function. The CC system allows a distributed risk model. I'm not saying that you couldn't construct a similar model for BTC, but good luck gettting all of the libertarians to buy in to that.
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:37:10
The thing is that with Bitcoin there are zero mechanisms for accountability in the end. You're right that 99% of transactions go through with no problem. But if not? You're effed.
I'm not say BTC is useless. I would spend it on transactions where I didn't care if I got burned or not, like a $10 CD. But I wouldn't transfer thousands of dollars worth to someone I didn't know *reeeeeeeally* well.

At this rate bitcoin should hit broad adoption in a millennium or so. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 21:29:41
I disagree. In the past 12 months many countries have banned the currency outright. In developing areas technological adoption isn't really high enough to support broad usage. While this could temporarily change, I doubt it will last.
BTC depends on an environment with high personal and economic freedoms (controlling currency is one way to control people). States like Bangladesh have banned the currency outright. China is heavily regulating it. For the most part, the more governments learn about BitCoin the more they don't like it and the more they seek to quell it. Also, since BitCoin is readily used to send currency out of the country, states seeking to avoid capital flight have every incentive to clamp down on it.
BTC has the best chance in highly developed democratic countries, IMO. But the wave has crested and fallen. TIME magazine did a cover story about BTC last year which raised a lot of interest which has since died down. That was BitCoin's highwater mark, I'm afraid.

Some people like Gyft. Personally, I don't see the value in converting my dollars into Bitcoins to covert into Gyft to then turn around and buy products denoted in dollars. I would rather just spend dollars directly.

I would consider getting back into bitcoin if I could use it to play poker. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 05:07:06
Yes. It taught me a lesson. Don't invest in business you don't understand. This is why I'm selling.
@_date: 2014-12-29 05:23:49
If it takes till 2022 to see $750 again I will have definitely made the right decision.
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:36:38
See, you use the term "speculative value". This is a form of gambling, where you are unsure if the price will significantly rise or fall. I don't see many indicators that the price will rise. It's not impossible, sure, but my desire not to lose money on this (selling at a loss) is countered by my concern that I'm only gambling by staying with the currency.
@_date: 2014-12-29 03:51:49
That's my position. I feel that double digit bitcoins are entirely possible, maybe even sustainable. But that means that the rational thing to do is to sell my triple digit coins and rebuy at a lower value.
@_date: 2014-12-29 03:49:20
I don't see this as shortsightedness. I feel this is making a rational decision based on the information at hand.
Maybe I'll be using the Blockchain in the future. That doesn't mean Bitcoin as a currency is going to appreciate in my given timeline. Since I see this as an investment, the rational thing is to cut my losses and move on.
@_date: 2014-12-25 17:07:32
There are scams in every currency, every day. Mostly aimed at the financially desperate and mentally enfeebled. Bitcoin users tend to be more financially stable and at least have the intellect to operate the technology, so it's really beyond me why they fall for scam after scam, half of which originate on the front page of r/Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:31:07
Users may be climbing. But usage is more or less flat. Adoption is slow. Is this what success looks like?
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:52:47

Yes, that's a factor in my decision.

@_date: 2015-01-13 15:46:31
Realistically, you should all be selling your bitcoin. Dump your coins, crash the price, and move all of the speculators out of the market. Then build the currency back up using a sustainable price model.

You seem to make the case that in order to dislike Bitcoin you must be opposed to it on some sort of technical level, using only objective criteria. What if some people just don't like using it? They find it difficult to store and use, and they think the user experience just isn't very good? What if some people don't like the price fluctuations and not knowing day to day what their money will buy?
You are dismissing all "emotional" criteria. I think the technical community quickly dismisses such subjective criteria, however these are the things that can make or break a technology, or a community.

I think a better question is why the creation of new coins is fixed within the protocol at all. It seems like blindly adding new coins to the system without regard to other variables in the system is not a good idea for a currency. It seems like the amount of coins generated per block should be calculated based on transaction volume, the price per coin, and other factors.
If people want to create an actual decentralized currency, the currency must be smarter about regulating itself.

So, you've never heard of this happening, ergo this is impossible. It's impossible for Bitpay to have a settlement issue and customer support not responding in a timely manner. Therefore this man is either a liar or highly confused, based on this article, according to you.

Yep, same thing happened to me when I donated some BTC to the EFF. I chose the dollar amount of my Mycellium wallet's value. EFF uses Bitpay (I think) for the transaction, but Bitpay and Mycellium had different exchange rate values that I didn't notice. Bitpay creates an "invoice" denominated in BTC that is 0.1% more than the value of the BTC I am donating. After I donate, the invoice doesn't show as fully paid, and I'm told I will need to fund the remander of the invoice, or I'm given the option to get my BTC back. I say "fuck it" and that it's EFF's problem now...

This is the best advice. Instead of waiting four days for a wire, let's dick around on Skype with some random Egyptians, sending microtips to each other.

Yes, Visa has a "first mover" advantage. That's something bitcoin needs to surmount. It's not enough for Bitcoin to be just as good as Visa at Point-of-Sale service, it needs to be better. And it's not getting there fast enough. The credit card industry can continue to innovate at a much faster pace because it has the resources to do so. Bitcoin doesn't stand a chance for POS.

Right. So you're tipping people in money they can't use. Do you not see the problem some people would have with that? Of course you don't.
Let me explain: People don't want internet funbux lottery tickets. They want to pay their heating bill. They don't want $10 or $50 or $100 in money they can't use. They don't want to have to sign up with their bank information just to get your lousey tip.

The original issue that Ross tried to "settle" with the hit was over a kilo of coke, so yes those volumes were being transacted. 
You're making the case that SR was taking existing dealers operating in a violent environment and moving them to a safer online environment. I'm saying that SR actually took people who were unable or unwilling to deal drugs in an in-person violent environment and enabled them to enter the market, so overall violence was not appreciably reduced and overall drug transaction volume was increased. 
And while some drugs are more harmless socially than others, increasing the volume of drugs like meth is a net negative cost to society, even if the drug transaction itself was peaceful. Not to mention some of the incredibly fucked up "services" offered for sale on SR. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 13:44:20

As discussed ad nauseum in this sub, Bitcoin the protocol can't scale to levels needed to handle transaction numbers to get close to visa without sidechains and a bunch of other ridiculous shit that hasn't been invented yet. It can't sufficiently confirm transactions in a timeframe needed for POS.  
Instead of doing a shitty job in the POS game, why doesn't Bitcoin stick to what it does best and concentrate on online sales with no chargebacks?

Companies don't offer sales, typically, to people who are paying with specific payment options. Not to the tune of 25%, at least. If I do a $200 job and get paid $150 in bitcoin, I've just paid $50 for the privliage of not having to buy the bitcoin myself at the exchange. Maybe that's worth it to you, I don't know.

So, you're going to carry a bunch of $10 paper wallets (oh, wait, $50 wallets, you're a high roller I forgot) around with you so that when you eat you can give the option for the server to take the funbux over the cash? Servers are trained to be polite and agreeable, so I'm sure they'll hear you out. Then they'll have to make the decision about potentially risking offending you if they want the cash, or taking the funbux and missing out on a usable tip.
You're basically a Jehovah's Witness. You're taking a segment of the population that has not demostrated any interest in what you're peddling, and bothering them about your esoteric interest. Except, someone can just close the door on a Jehovah's Witness. You're putting someone in a difficult position that involves their livlihood because they can't just close the door on you, a paying customer. And, in all seriousness, that's why I consider it a dick move.
If you're trying to generate traction for bitcoin, this isn't the way to do it. How many people do you know who think favorably about Jehovah's Witnesses?
