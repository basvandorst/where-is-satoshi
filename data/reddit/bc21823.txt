I think Erik gets a lot of undeserved hate from the bitcoin evangelists in this community because his opinion on altcoins evolved overtime, but have to agree that still pushing for 2x makes very little sense when looking at it in terms of necessity. As BCH gave us routes for both big and little blockers to pursue independently, the argument that we need to compromise now seems moot as each group can already go their seperate ways. I would be curious to know why he and other NYA signatories still believe the 2x portion is still important enough to potentially divide the community yet again.

I think this is the wallet I have running on the old andriod phone I first used to store bitcoin. I had to use it recently to move some bitcoin around and don't think I saw an option to change the fee. The old version on the phone had a static fee of .1 mBTB and when I updated it looked like its default was raised to just over .5 mBTC, but did change if the transaction involved more inputs. I'm not a huge fan and wouldn't personally use it as my go-to mobile wallet.

Yea, that whole Greenspan name drop seemed like a weak attempt to legitimize herself as an early proponent of Bitcoin, and associate herself with a controversial but none the less respected economist. I agree with a lot of what she said, and think it is great that more and more people are coming out in support of Bitcoin, but there is no need to exaggerate her bona fides as a crypto guru.
