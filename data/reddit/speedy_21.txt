HELLO WORLD!!
I am totally disgusted at the way Mandrilk0 has been treating one of my colleagues.  He had his account hacked on the 15th December and the GREAT Mandrik0 cancels tickets.
Is this the Blockchain work conduct? Or Just Mandrik0??
He is not even willing to connect with the real person in question?  WHY?
Maybe I should post the IP address that was supposed to be the person in question, and Blockchain believed the hacker!! WOW 
NOW ALL Blockchain is doing DELETING ANY TICKETS.. Great ethical work conduct Sir.

Thought this was for SUPPORT of it's customers?
Let's face it ladies and gents, if it wasn't for people like yourself **Blockchain would not be in BIZ**
They are excellent at one thing I see..
**Sorry, your account has been suspended.
 
Sign in to Blockchain**
WOW I have escalated to having tickets deleted to having my account SUSPENDED!!
Mandrik0 you are one amazing dude, really know your job, you know how to press a DELETE button!!
I know many people out there are having there BLOCKCHAIN account hacked every day, hour,minute,second.. 
Now why does Blockchain let this happen??
They are meant to be keeping your FUNDS SAFE &amp; SECURE, I am positive I read this on there website!!
maybe a chimp could take over your post Mandrik0
simply because all you seem to know is DELETE!!

They don't verify though, you get a email in 15mins after the crime has been committed..
What good is that? except to the criminal?
Then don't investigate, just delete tickets!!!

This is really starting to piss me off, that is yet another ticket cancelled.  Without any explanation what so ever.
I am not asking the for the earth from Madrik0, just to do his job and SPEAK TO MY COLLEAGUE!!
I know he cant tell me but CANCELLING TICKETS is the height of ignorance!! Not cool at all.
This Blockchain person is needing further investigation into... That is all I am asking!!
Mandrik0 STOP HITTING THE DELTE BUTTON &amp; ACTUALLY ANSWER YOUR CUSTOMER whom you have left in a lot of DISTRESS!!
I as Mr Randall's friend will not let this matter go, and NO ONE ELSE SHOULD GIVE UP EITHER just because Mandrik0 knows how to PRESS the delete button ON HIS PC!!

Blockchain will never ask for your password?
This is a load of PISS!!
I know for a fact Blockchain has requested PASSWORD(s) over email!!
It is torture trying to get a straight answer from Blockchain, ie if they don't like you for un known reason they just DELETE!!
Better going to any other Company..
**Blockchain** seems to have a high number of hackers!!  **There Policy absolutely stinks**
You can't get to speak to anyone, Now I wonder why?
*8Some people may wonder if the staff are actually associated with the SCAMS being plagued by people**

I am reading about a lot of people being hacked when they have a **Blockchain Account**
Now I am not a suspicious person, but when my colleagues tickets keep being CANCELLED without any further follow up by Mandrik0 I do wonder what is GOING ON HERE!!
Hhmmm let the ** GREAT PUBLIC MAKE THERE OWN MINDS UP**
Now what if this was your account that had been hacked Mandrik0 **wouldn't you want SOME ANSWERS, instead all you are seem to accomplish in doing IS DELETE TICKETS**
Some one may assume you are in actual fact involved in such a scam!!!
