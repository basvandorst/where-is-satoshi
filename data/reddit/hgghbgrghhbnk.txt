I would recommend an EUR account in the sepa zone. I suspect it will be very difficult to get one as a non-resident. You might consider opening a limited company and getting a corporate account. That will probably mean a lot more paperwork when joining an exchange though.

I guess Gmail requested to handle mailto: links, and the browser prompts to accept but it's just a generic message that also mentions bitcoin:

I am kind of making this up as I'm not familiar with the terminology, but the basic idea with drive chains is that you are putting the funds under control of the miners. They police cash in and out of the other chain, but while it's in the other chain it's really just locked up in a big miner controlled communal pot. If enough hash power goes rogue they can steal it. This is pretty different to bilateral payment channels which are only used to process transactions that you are a party too. As to which is better, they serve different purposes. Ln transactions obey all the normal bitcoin transaction rules because they are really just unbroadcasted bitcoin transactions. The side chains can be anything.. the only thing you need is enough miner support to hold all the funds and understand your new chain so they can process withdrawals back to bitcoin.

It could help build remote power plants.. of course those wouldn't be immediately useful for anything else, but once it's built and maybe even paid for maybe later transmission lines can be built to attach it to the grid. It also could act as a swing load to turn on at night when people are not using so much power.

I don't think it's a new law.. more like Puerto Rico has never got around to taxing CGT.. probably because it wouldn't have raised much money anyway since most people there didn't have any gains to tax.
@_date: 2018-10-05 20:49:16
They don't. The sha256s are hashes of the current block which also changes whenever another transaction happens.. also the miners probably insert their own stuff like the coinbase tx that mean they are not usually working on the same problem.
@_date: 2018-10-14 13:35:43
The article is total bs. Legal tender means that a creditor can't refuse it when tendered to discharge a debt. No country forces anyone to accept payment in bitcoin nor is it likely that any country will anytime soon, so Zambia confirming that they don't isn't even worth saying (other than to fud)

Don't see why it would.. might even have the opposite effect.. since now bitcoin exchanges will have to be regulated in FATF jurisdictions.. making them more corporate friendly.
It might create some niche opportunity for FATF blacklisted jurisdictions and unmonitored ones like most of Africa - hosting some non compliant business.. but it's probably usually better to go with a Dao or something. A business not registered anywhere rather than a pariah jurisdiction.

I don't think much thought went into that statement. Bgp will never be used for ln.. there are more suitable routing protocols in the ad-hoc mesh wireless space.

An alternative would be equity investment where the payback is denominated in shares or something other than BTC.

Imo this might be an attempt to prevent rehipothecated BTC ETF units when an ETF is launched - which would be a good thing imo. It doesn't sound like it would stop exchanges from allowing leveraged positions..

Only the hash of the script is signed, so no. Basically the idea would be to make a null script (no signatures) that just returns true and some padding/nonce to get the right hash.

The hex is just one way of representing some bytes. ASCII is another.. although restricting yourself to only printable ASCII is a bad idea for security.

It could maybe also allow theft of funds if you could make a script that matched an existing script hash.

You start a company in whatever eu country. Then open a bank account for it. Many countries don't require resident directors. Estonia has their e-residency stuff which might be a good way to go. The UK is also very easy to incorporate in.. however UK banks probably won't bank a crypto related company. You can open bank accounts in Europe with a UK company though.. at least for a few more months (not sure what happens at Brexit, but most likely they won't be closing accounts).. also there are non bank account providers such as okpay that are crypto friendly.

Yea I feel like they explained it wrong.. the transactions and previous block hash are part of the proof of work.. so it can't happen after. Also the target for the hash is under a threshold not a specific value. It would also be nice if they illustrated a competitive situation where two miners find a block at the same time and one of them gets orphaned.
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:18:24
Uhh, no. Cargo ships take weeks to travel.. the speed of databases are not a significant limiting factor.. nor will Blockchain do anything to speed them up (quite the opposite, but it still won't matter either way). Global trade is not likely to increase by 10x imo. Unless maybe by inflation, in which case sure but who cares.

 If you want rsk but buy btc and then send it to rsk you have to pay for an onchain BTC transaction. If you just buy rsk directly and withdraw that then you only pay a (presumably lower) rsk fee. There's also faster confirmation on the rsk chain, which might be even more important actually.

No. The New York department of financial services has licensed itbit.com and gemini.com as banks, and they invented the much hated bitlicense. Bitcoin.de recently bought a bank. So yea there are now several regulated entities doing crypto asset exchanges.

Yes. The programs are tiny though due to the enormous expense of executing them on every node at once. They are mostly used to do something with payments like check a condition or allow multisignatures. Update an  access control, etc. You can't really use them to compute much although technically nothing stops you other than the tx fees.
@_date: 2018-11-24 13:38:15
Localbitcoins.com - find a reputable seller, they will want a pic of your id probably.. then instant faster payments from your bank account and they release the coins. Bitbargain.co.uk is a similar P2P marketplace.. generally their prices tend to be worse, but it's even faster than LBC.

Pos probably doesn't really work. An explicit list of validators (like ripple stellar and hyperledger / cords) is probably better than pos for most cases where it possibly might be acceptable.

Yes except it may not really be tethered and regardless of whether it is or isn't, there have been occasional panics where the price became unpegged on exchanges.
