Consensus should try to take everyone along as a team , and not try to divide the team.because United we stand and divided we fall.

Memorize it . Using the connection method 
Let’s say your words are 
Scooter coffee bank ant porridge.....
Imagine , the more outrageous the better 
You are driving a scooter with a coffee machine in the back, and all of a sudden a Bank officer tickets you and arrests you and puts you in the back of his car with an ant who stole a bowl of porridge ..... keep building the connection with all your words and keep mentally revising this connection as many times a day as possible

I did not have any concerns on the hard fork . But Now that it’s cancelled , I am thinking who were these clowns who came up with this idea , didn’t they think this through , didn’t they do their due diligence, impact analyze this change  etc 
I mean even a mom and pop shops technology department would analyze more than this 
Bunch of jokers.

What is air gapping 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:21:10
Exactly . They don’t want the public to use it for buying and selling stuff . Even though everyone is using it as currency. They want to label it as a commodity and pigeon hole it into the same bracket as oil, vegetables , cattle, tungsten , wheat aka commodity 
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:41:49
Also trezors can be hacked . So waste no time . Buy a new trezor , unlock your seed with it and transfer the funds to another wallet as soon as possible

Right , cold offline wallets are a must and as the price increases the need to do offline transactions will increase . 
There are lots of guides online which help you do that
1. Setup an offline wallet 
2. Sign transactions on offline computer
3. Transfer this transaction to online computer and transmit the transaction to blockchain
This guarantees that your private keys are never online .
I think everyone who is serious about bitcoin should practice and familiarize these techniques

There is one way to time the market and I have had 100% success with it . 
.you buy then 
It’s called hodl

Mark these words you just said . Evaluate it when it reaches 8k next month

Ha ha

That's exactly correct. This bubble will see the size of the internet bubble at least and even surpass it by 50%

With some much money riding on bitcoin . The dev teams will device some mechanism . Moreover quantum computing will get to us in slow phases. Will give us plenty of time to address it

But the moment something gets centralized . Another centralized resistant coin will rise and take over . This is just the beginning

thanks for dogecoin, thats how I started investing in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:30:41
But the older chain which we call btc will be still there I believe . Agreed btc transactions can show up in segwit2x chain and the other way . Buy both chains should be able to coexist . 
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:22:58
I believe price should be proportional to adoption . And I know the price will rise exponential in the coming years . Peoples reaction is one of irrational exuberance or morbid fear . The former fuels the bubble and the later bursts it .
Just because something has potential for not mean that you have to price it so high . But in reality we are in very initial stages of a bubble and time will attest to this fact . But this analysis can only happen after the bubble has burst
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:01:17
Actually , if someone says something bad about btc , it goes up 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:23:12
Unless the algorithm takes time stamp into consideration . Something similar to guid. There is always a chance that two set of word seeds could end up with two different people and cause conflict with balances

Based on last fork . Once the new network and the bitcoin network stabilize after a week from fork , btc price should rise even further , because this is a validation that the fundamentals are strong with bitcoin. As for the new coin it will be pretty much based on what people think it's worth .
Once the new wallet is released . You can import your btc private keys/ seeds to claim the new coin. 
But I would wait 1 week before claiming 
We have 2 forks upcoming 
Oct 25 : bitcoin gold , this is a tame form , so to speak , because there is replay protection and the new network does not claim to be the new bitcoin . It just says that we are creating a new coin. 
November segwit2x: this is the one I would worry about because the two camps , bitcoin core and segwit2x camp
Want to claim that theirs is the real bitcoin and segwit2x has not put in any replay protection . Even here you will have to wait and watch till the networks stabilize
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:18:15
I agree , we have to disengage from comparing to usd

Time to implement lightning networks for bitcoin . There is a real need for this 
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:31:37
And it can reach that market cap. It depends on if the people decide . Btc is also like a global stock which no body can dilute . This is a truly distributed consensus mechanism. If some rick investors decide they want to take the value of bitcoin by ignoring it , they will do at their own peril , because some others will pick it up
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:11:37
This is also To all those suggesting forking or splitting the coin is the solution . Why can’t we arrive on a consensus and upgrade the existing network . Please don’t play politics with the coin

Really , I already have a monopoly over money in the form of gold . Now all of a sudden some folks with printing machines come along and take away my monopoly and I would embrace it. Makes a lot of sense to me

Buy a new wig for yourself and Try walking in rectangles . That should keep you sane
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:58:29
Hmm. On a side note . I always have a nagging doubt it the seed word can be copied before shipping and then they can sweep the coins into another wallet . Is this possible . I am talking not about official sellers but third part independent sellers
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:40:48
I kind of expected it to be more . Thank you for pointing out the number of nodes

It's bitcoin , not a tulip

Buying opportunity is a relative term . When btc was trading at around 2000 earlier this year I was telling my friends that it’s overvalued . Now in my opinion 2000 is cheap for btc .  Predicting the price is such a futile exercise

Oh absolutely , when I say bubble I am not discounting the power of the blockchain by any measure . Blockchain will do to business what the Internet stated

This time it's a codebase takeover . But code will still have. A fork. And people will denounce the fork which has vested interest . In a way it's good that this is happening now so we can vet the bitcoin technology for sturdiness to handle the mirage of potential forks like this 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:40:07
For the current adoption it's a bubble , say 10% of the worlds population was in bitcoins . This price is justified

not fair

Ledger nano is ahead compared to Trezor currently. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:11:13
Bought a nano s . Does not work on my Mac or Linux. I feel like hardware wallets are a waste of money for long term hodlers. Get your private key and seed word and secure them . Use the hardware money to buy some more crypto
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:36:57
Yes for 580.0
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:12:12
I would rather we upgrade the existing network , instead of splitting it 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:02:28
Why not , you can pay taxes  in anything which has agreed upon value

Yup , china made themselves irrelevant the last time around. I would love to see China  put more restrictions on bitcoins, and get laughed out of the room

Guys I am a big fan and I want the price to rise incrementally like it has happened this year. Just stating the fact . Fact is a fact like it or not . For the current level of 
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:43:21
It will eventually get picked up , but will be delayed a lot
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:42:07
It will be a one of kind bubble. Also think of the ecosystem around it which will contribute to it . This will be the mother of all
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:32:54
It's best to get a hold of your private key . 2 weeks after the hard form just import the keys into their respective wallets 
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:03:06
I think you just answered your question

Agreed , but I am
Comparing it to fiat , we don't care about the million other altcoins and their white papers . 90% of the world uses fiat . I am not sure what % of the world uses/owns bitcoin 
We need billions of people adopting it . And it will come I know . There is no stopping it . We need massive adoption still to go

I hear you . But the bitcoin community will do well if we have a value store that is also lightning fast . And best of all it's doable with current technology , so why not 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:14:25
think far far into the future 500 years from now, fiat currency ruled for 2000 years at least
altcoins will rule for 500 . 500 because of the faster rate of innovation. the next currency concept will be even more fascinating that blockchain 
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:11:06
Amen to that

This is a good idea , just your receive address

So this kind of fork can be done by anyone with some hashing power right ? So isn't it a vulnerability in the bitcoin code .
