Or buy guns, a lot of guns!
Just encrypt your "i-dont-touch-this-btc"-keys with a password which you remember -&gt; print it -&gt; bring it to your bank. Delete your "i-dont-touch-this-btc"-keys from your pc.
Noone can get your key: Your bank cant decrypt it and any robber who is going to torture you for the key will do it for nothing: It is probably impossible for you to remember 256 chars.
Tell your family about the password in case you die -&gt; they can decrypt your message in the bank and get the key.
Don't forget to buy guns, a lot of guns!

Thank you :) Sounds legit
 predicts that paying `0.000576` for `192bytes` is legit because I'm paying `0.000576/192=0.000003` per byte.
Paying only 0.000003 means the btc will arive between `4-95` blocks = `30min - 14h`. I'm just sending my satoshis from one key to another key. No worries, I can wait even longer.
PS:^I trust  because it is refered here

People do a lot for money (even for much lower amounts than 50mio $)...
I would not be suprised if your brother got killed because someone wanted to steal his bitcoins.
Humans are greedy and they can be wonderful and they can be monsters.
Good wishes! And I hope the best for your family.
