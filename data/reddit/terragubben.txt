Safello is a Swedish based retailer serving mainly Sweden and Netherlands, but also anyone in Europe through SEPA. 
We get our prices from a liquidity pool, it should be pretty good in most cases. Safello also add a fee which of course will effect the price you get.

@_date: 2014-02-18 14:22:48
We have support for SEPA :) so we can accept any European customer.
As for the browser issue that only occurs in really old IE browsers, other than that the site works for most people.

I would personally say that the bad actors have to leave the market before it can function efficiently.
We have to go through fire to cleanse the market of bad actors.

Sorry, I don't see what your resume has to do with this? (maybe I am misunderstanding something?)
You can give us suggestions on how to improve our sorting/filtering, but other than creating a new tab on the document, I don't think you can do any specific sorting/filtering without destroying the data for other people.

Okay great, if you guys need any help then don't hesitate on contacting me. If I can't help you then I am sure I know someone who does :)

This is a potential risk, we think that the benefit to our customers overweight the potential risk. But if it is used for speculation in to big of a extent then we will have to look over our solution.

Here is the link to the new site for the updated database.
You can sort and filter in this one :)

No, I never checked out. I am still deciding on what/if I should get something :)
Ah okay I see, too bad.

Nice to see you accepting Bitcoin, combining two of my current passions whiskey and Bitcoin :)
I love the 109 casks, they look awesome!
Has the TestBed1 gone out of stock?

That's true, it is meant for people who have little to no experience in Bitcoin. So to make a informed decision it is probably best to just do some research before picking your wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:57:08
Ah glad you could find a use for the data :-) Okay I can create a new tab where it is sorted by country. I will also write a guide on how to request  rights

We are working on a new solution to make it easier to sort and filter, so we are looking into other solutions than google docs
@_date: 2012-10-23 15:02:10
It goes faster if you use the whole hashing power of the pool :D

Stream is now starting over at twitch.tv/Deadgaming, check it out for a couple of epic games and a night of starcraft 2 :D

Haha your right sorry about that xD 
@_date: 2012-10-23 13:54:18
It's a pool which mines for vanity addresses
These are addresses that are esthetically appealing for example
1SecretSnack might be the start of a address that you would like to have.
You can then enter the amount you want to pay for such a address and then someone will find such a address for you.
@_date: 2012-10-23 13:07:02
Haha, yea I like the concept of it so I am trying to spread it. Plus if it catches on that means more work and more cool addresses ^^
@_date: 2012-10-24 06:38:59
The pool also supports GPU :)
@_date: 2012-01-07 16:37:17
Indeed, but we can't adjust for every big tournament as almost every weekend there is one, so we just go with the flow and stick to the dates we picked early on :)

The more people who join the cheaper it will become as it is a fixed rate for the whole rack.
Also you don't need to dedicate for half a year like KnCMiner :)

This is TB's personal wallet I made him setup yesterday :P
It will do for now until I can get a hold of him to generate a fresh donation address.
I don't have a quote from TB yet so if you trust me send along, if you don't then wait a bit until TB has posted the official address.

Contact the government branch that deals with regulation of financial services etc, and make sure that you are complying with the existing regulation.

Everyones welcomed :D

@_date: 2013-12-10 14:19:10
Right now we use Bitcoins that are stored on the ATM, but in the future (before we set it out in the public), We plan to connect it to the Safello back end so that we exchange the Bitcoins as someone pays in the Bitcoin ATM. That we we don't take any exchange risk and will always have Bitcoin available.
As for the % it is not yet decided but probably a bit higher than the current percentage of 4% that Safello takes due to the costs of handling cash.

We do local bank transfers in Sweden only and for direct payments we only do this for internal bank transfers in our banks (currently only Handelsbanken but we are looking to expand).
These bank transfers are basically irreversible.
We have never had a charge back, as bank transfers are final, in almost all cases.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:08:43
This is technically not true.
A Bitcoin company got denied on the grounds that they were high risk and didn't have good enough AML/KYC.
This doesn't necessarily mean that they won't accept any Bitcoin company.

Map hacks and such is generally almost non existent in Stacraft 2 due the the heavy punishment from blizzard.
It's also very easy to spot from watching replays of that person playing.
