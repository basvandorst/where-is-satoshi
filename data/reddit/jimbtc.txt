Wrong. Channel needs to be funded with max amount of BTC you want to spend. So for a year of coffee you'd need to fund it with 1 years worth of coffee in advance.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:57:55
Exactly. And if by December 2018 you got it wrong as you invited your mother-in-law for a few coffees you'd need to pay $50+ fees to fund a few more coffees to a new channel.

What I said toaster. After a while watching how the game plays out you quickly learn (if you're smart enough) that the biggest threats to Bitcoin always come from the inside.
We've seen with the shitfork of BCash that came from a crowd of Big Blocker maniacs that should of been put down before they managed to even start calling for debates. They used out platform to launch, if we had put them down at the first instance they would never of been able to form their faux-movement.
Never trust a miner. All I can say.

Why would we need blocks if we are running the entire protocol on the LN?
LN is channel streams and very organic and dynamic. Doesn't look block-shaped as much as it isn't hub and spoke shaped. It's too decentralized and too smart to be blocks.
Block-shaped thinking didn't get anybody anywhere. Blocks are so 2009.

Good. Let's hope the miners suffer because they are scumbags. If Lightning Network is as good as they say we can change protocol to run the entire bitcoin network on LN and fuck all the miners.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:08:02
Look a BCash troll. I been lurking for years you think i found Bitcoin 7 weeks ago? Retard.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:35:12
Our scaling solution just keeps getting better and better. As soon as we've got Segwit 100% we can fit entire BCash blockchain in just 1 TX and spam Roger Ver with 1 massive TX.
So much win and scale with Segwit, best tech ever and even better than what Satoshi did. Real genius from our genius core devs. Thanks guys.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:23:29
As soon as Schorr Signatures gets implemented it probably can be upgraded to DApps. But some might see it as a downgrade.
I like my store of value to be just that - a store of value better than gold. Why would I need a DApp?

On the homepage of there is a advertisement to a BTrash community. Can we all report this and get it banned? Is there any way the page can be filtered to not show BTrash sponsored links?
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:04:54
Soon our mempool is going to be smaller than their blocksize. We will be doing millions of transactions each day on Lightning Network and their users will soon demand the best tech such as Segwit which is better than anything Satoshi or their fake Satoshi ever did. They will fork to a BCash Segwit or Jihan will yurn off all their miners. This is future guaranteed of their shitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:26:21
133mb blocks? Are you crazy? Sounds like you are a BCash supporter.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:44:06
BCash kills lives. Can't wait for the Big BCash Crash (BBCashCrash) and to see them all suiciding like the sorry cryptards they are. "Mwahhhhhh why did I sell my Bitcoin for BCash"..... "Mwahhhhhhhh" &lt;jump&gt; LOL
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:22:49
Who cares? It's a miners problem. Let the miners suffer they deserve it.
Node Operator FTW ;)
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:28:43
Your fault. Should be using 0.16 with RBF by default. If you're not running 0.16 *you* are the problem not the network.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:23:31
Upgrade to 0.16 and use killer RBF feature FTW. I posted earlier that people running versions earlier than 0.16 were anti-protocol, with RBF being new default this is classic example why.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:46:33
run the whole thing - Bitcoin protocol and all, run it all on the Lightning Network. LN is built for scaling and is trustless, stable and secure. We don't need no stinking miners, screw the miners.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:58:22
BCash sucks and is a losercoin without great tech such as Segwit and Lightning Network. Its users are retarded, its owners are pedos, federal criminals and mining cartels. No need to waste more time discussing.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:15:30
You're defending the indefensable. Which part of BCash do you like best the pedo cartel or the mining cartel? 
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:27:58
Those were perhaps the old rules. Now we have full-retard coins such as BCash spreading FUD, in my opinion you either need to start using SegWit or you should stop using Bitcoin and calling yourself a Bitcoin user. I would rather see non-Segwit users not using Bitcoin than this talk of "Legacy transactions" etc... There are no legacy transactions - only transaction (Segwit ones) everything else is a Loser transaction.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:31:52
Well RBF is leading edge stuff. Another reason why Trezor sucks I guess. If they can't implement RBF (latest 0.16 change has just been to make it default and remove 0-conf exploit) how are they truly going to be part of the Bitcoin scalability future if they're as slow as this implementing Schorr Signatures or LN?
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:39:46
Should block the 0.15.x nodes. It's time to be totally onboard with latest and greatest Bitcoin or you are against Bitcoin. RBF is now default but these morons running old versions will only confuse the RBF technology and early adapters of this great tech.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:13:34
Right now maybe, but remember a year ago the idea of Segwit being a success was rubbished. If we start to constrain ourselves to what Satoshi did we wouldn't get anywhere. He never envisaged killer-tech such as Segwit, RBF and Schorr Signatures cause I guess cause he just wasn't smart enough. If one thing following the scene has taught me is that Bitcoin has the smartest devs, and if there is a way to run the protocol on the LN network itself they will be able to design it.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:03:23
Miner assholes we hope you are listening. We are sick of all the bad and evil things you do to our coin, and we the people with our trusty band of node sysops will be taking over. This is not a threat, this is a prophecy you punkass bitches! Nodes FTW, screw all miners.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:06:10
But this is Lightning Network. It ain't no ordinary layer. And why are you only thinking in 2 dimensions?
If LN is half as good as they tell us then I think to restrict oneself to thinking in terms of traditional layers would be kind of restrictive altcoin thinking. This is Bitcoin damnit.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:17:28
Miners need us a lot more than we need them. Miners have already proven themselves untrusting to Bitcoin, mining for their own selfish interests. Whenever we can we should destroy all revenue streams for the miners, destroy the miners as we should remember how they treat us and are quick to switch to crap like BCash when it suits them.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:19:16
I think everyone can make mistakes sometimes. Even the awesome LN devs.
When it comes to choosing the wisest words from the wisest and smartest devs I trust Bitcoin Core every time. 1 meg is more than enough, anyone who tells you otherwise doesn't know what they are talking about or are a BCash shill.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:40:39
Wake up yourself. People are not using it for speculation, it has already proven it's value. People are using it as e-gold, as a better than gold store of value. Who cares about currency? Bitcoin is for bigger things.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:41:16
Hey BTrash fan. Why are you here on this subreddit? Is it just for concern trolling?
When Lightning Network Whitepaper was released they didn't realise core-devs where getting busy with Schorr Signatures, thus any ridiculously large blocksizes a big-blocker Ver fanboy such as yourself suggests (e.g. 133meg which is clearly ridiculous) are mute points. Thankfully LN is being built organically now, because the space moves to quick to be constrained by whitepapers. If that was so we'd all still be following the ancient nowadays irrelevant texts of Satoshi and never improving anything.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:25:38
Retard is someone still holding BCash.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:29:45
Bullshit. If ever threat of 51% attack our great core dev team can just fork away and we can implement certs for verified miners who will be the only ones who can mine. Haha jihan wu can go fuck himself if he wants authorization hahaha
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:06:09
You're right. It's easy to feel negative when you accidentally see a photo of Roger Ver, Faketoshi or Jihan Wu when following the scene.
We should concentrate on the positive things this month, finally got RBF implemented by default for smarter fee adjustment and removal of 0-conf exploit (once everyone upgrades of course which is why I want to see upgrading).
We've got SegWit going exceedingly well, and when Schorr signatures comes along and the final polish is done to LN we've basically got unlimited super-cheap scaling, on a Raspberry Pi.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:46:23
It was probably Roger Ver.
Oh no, I forgot he's got a lifetime ban from eBay for selling bombs on there :)
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:50:19
If you're not using SegWit you are on BCash shitaltcoin chain. I am more concerned about RBF which now has the correct defaults but only in latest 0.16.0 version, because the further away we can move from those BCashtards the better. Everything they are doing - we should do the opposite, it's no longer about small vs big blocks.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:17:52
Can you not use RBF feature? Version 0.16 of core client leads the way here. Not sure if the techheads at Trezor have got round to the A-list features of core client yet and probably still run old 0-conf exploit code.
