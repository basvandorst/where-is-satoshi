Let's start from defense. Best defense is wide usage and acceptance, especially among rich people. Affluent people will not want to lose their money in BTC.
Government can impose additional reporting requirements to the taxpayers who are in cryptospace. Compliance costs can be very high.
For example, they may require you to report every public key that you ever used.

Totally free LN node may be difficult. Sooner or later transactions would need to be recorded on the main blockchain. If there are a lot of ending balances and a lot of accounts, recording fee can probably eat entire deposit.... Share with us on what you find.

You are right. Russia has super cheap electricity. A lot of excessive nuclear and hydro.
That being said, there are a lot of things that are for free and require much less effort: lumber, oil, gas, entire periodic table.

You are obviously joking, and the answer to your question is in Google, not in Bitcoin subredit. However, all answers deserve to be answered, thus the answer:
The raw materials for gold are protons and neutrons, which comprise nucleus of gold atom. 
It is possible to create gold by bombarding other heavy metal. Specifically, only the mercury isotope 196Hg, which occurs with a frequency of 0.15% in natural mercury, can be converted to gold by slow neutron capture, and following electron capture, decay into gold's only stable isotope, 197Au.
That being said, the price of such gold would be astronomical and such gold would be very very very expensive thus impractical.
To conclude, you have inferred that chemical processes produce new elements. Chemical processes are used to combine the elements to get new substances, but element production is within the scope of nuclear physics, not metallurgy or chemistry.

Lowering taxes benefits top ....
Interesting thinking....
Have you ever thought about the fact that when taxes were lower then redistribution was lower and wealth was more or less equally redistributed?
Have you ever entertained the idea that the higher taxes benefit namely 0.1%?

You will be getting firm and resound answer:
only inflationary currencies "encourage" spending.
Reality is you are probably in Keynesian school of thought, that believes in the "broken window" theory.
No, careful spending and calculated individual investment decisions are a key elements to the prosperity of society.

Try passive income, for example: sell some, buy a duplex and rent it out.
You will have a guaranteed income for a very long time. It is a bit of a hassle, however it will keep you busy. You can sell it anytime.
You need individual advice though, because generic advice will not be helpful, except for the advice to know that the time on earth is more important than all the money that you have.

Using this logic then, it appears, that if Segwit2x for is executed without having Core on board, then Segwit2x will not be a reliable network. 
Core will have slow confirmation times.
Segwit2x will have, the way i understand, half empty blocks, because it takes time to propagate transactions?

Putin is one of the wealthiest people on earth in any conventional terms. Same is applicable to the people around them. 
They are all very rich and are golden and they do not need about any other golden opportunity.
They have properly diversified assets everywhere and they will be using BTC as another way to diversify. I don't think they will be leading in that area.

It is clearly a spam. Yes, people are waiting for lower tx fees, however timing and coordination of increase represent, to quote Jihan "freedoms offered by Bitcoin protocol".
Yes, it is coordinated. Yes, it is malicious. No, it is not coincidence (for most of the western world these were ungoldy hours). 
Yes, if input is a lot of transactions with low fees, then the output is higher transaction fees, benefited by the majority of miners.

In Russia it is difficult to move money abroad. There are limits  ($5,000) and permissions are needed.
Once they understand that BTC does not required permission or license, it is a game changer for them.

You have made the assumption that Prime is included.
If you feel cheated, that means you are someone who takes things for granted. Purse said, that most of their "earners" ship quickly. Most does not mean all. 
If you use Bitcoin, then you know that the rules of logic apply everywhere. You were not cheated, you are disappointed by your own wishful thinking.

I understand that once in while some transactions can be processed very inexpensively and relatively fast. During the night and weekends, yes.
Just think it some other way: Let's say you open channel with 1BTC, and you need to close it after some time. At that time you need to record whatever open balances were in your channel. Let's say your channel one hundred thousand transactions and ten thousand public keys that had some balance in it.
Let's do the math. Ten thousand public keys will represent at least 226 byte each to record to the blockchain. 
Let's assume that You can record at 20 sat/byte rate:
20 sat/byte* 226* 10,000= 0.452 BTC
This is the assumption that all the transactons were taking place within your LN ecosystem....
Does that make sense? There still would be a need to collect 2 sat/byte as a transaction fee, so that you could close the channel....
Lightning can only be cheaper, if transactions are not settled on main blockchain, but rather the ownership changes hand off-the books.

Not the only way. A new method is required which would take into account the following:
- exclude stale Bitcoins (Satoshi N. coins, clearly abandoned, lost password and hardrives).
- Estimate a discount in order to separate holders versus active money.
My estimate is that only probably 10,000,000 are in play, which makes the market capitalisation much lower.
That being said, this is the new type of asset and investment and market cap criteria, applied to the stock of publicly traded stock, just does not apply here.

Bitcoin bonds for 200 BTC is a publicity show, nothing less.
Reality is that Bitbonds are possible, but only for customers with super deep pockets and serious collateral.
Volatility of fiat against BTC is insane. Imagine - a very simple example, someone issues 100 BTC bond/mortage, to buy a house/or a business. 100 BTC x $4,000 = $400,000
Let's say two years from now the house could be purchased by 20 BTC at $20,000 per BTC.
The debt will foreclose, since there is no chance of paying off the mortgage. BTC creditor will incur losses. Loss/Loss.
If it is a small business, business will go bankrupt. Loss/Loss.
If it is a large business, BTC will be repaid, but at serious losses. Loss to the debtor/win to the credit. No deal.So no. 
Bitcoin is ideal/perfect/superior retirement instrument, voluntary financial tool, though.
I predict here that in several years pension funds will be keeping a significant chunk of their assets in BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:01:01
You are presenting logical and articulate arguments.
If today BTC is 4K per coin and BCC is what, almost 1K per coin. Nobody can argue with straight face that copying of the code and making BCC means additional $15B value added.
Yes, rationally thinking, there are some huge discrepancies, since hard fork demonstrates irrational speculative expectations.
That being said, the best technology has the best opportunities to win.
Please keep in mind that the governments can be covertly initiating and incentivizing such distrust, hard forking and polarization.

Put it some other way. They only place where BTC bonds can be issued are BTC bases businessess: BTC mining companies and BTC exchanges, their revenue streams are naturally hedged.
Now, philosophically speaking the Bible was not so positive about interest rates, as it is very difficult to return loan of sound money (gold or BTC based loan).

World economy would work in way somewhat similar to the period prior to 1913.
- Money were hard to get. Interest rates were low.
- Wars were very expensive to wage. Wars would be the realm of totalitarian, authoritarian non-democratic countries, that have banned Bitcoin.
- Economic growth was mainly through innovation, capital supplied by savings.
- Frugal life style, yet durable output: long lasting cars, cloths, houses. People would be educated to invest their money wisely.
- Low income taxes, since governments would not be willing to borrow money via Bitcoin, since debts would need to be returned in Bitcoin, as such low interest expenses and lower taxes.
- Social services would be based on charitable givings. By people volunteering their time and money to help others.
- There would not be serious housing price inflation. Currently housing is used as inflation hedge. With Bitcoin, that would be unnecessary.

How, in your opinion, economy worked before 1913? 
Economy was based on gold, savings and innovations, and wars were considered an expensive affair, with human soldiers being cheap foot soldiers.
Wars would be very difficult, since financing the war with debt would be very expensive, and people are no longer inexpensive.
You are welcome to rethink your paradigms.

Yes, absolutely. It is the in the future. However it is difficult to make money out of it.
Here is how it works:
1. Every election is one blockchain.
2. Every vote is open: Yes or No, Candidate 1 or Candidate 2.
3. Every voter has a choice: leave identity open or anonymous
4. Every voter has unique identifier, with the time stamp.
5.  Every voter gets a receipt with his transaction id, so that he could check anytime where his vote is. Basically to check the math.
6. Add the usual security found in blockchains, and that will make it difficult to make voter fraud.
That being said, if people could vote with blockchains, then they surely could vote on specific policy matters.

When Venezuela money keeps losing value due to the hyperinflation, it is very important for them to have something that is stable and untouchable.

Bitcoin stole his thunder.
It is somewhat similiar the way early Bitcoin holders looked down to Ethereum crowd. Ethereum crowd did not wan to pay exorbitant price for Bitcoin, thus they made their own currency.
Schiff is both right and wrong and the same time. During the next economic meltdown it had to be gold's turn to be safe haven and the price of gold had to rise to $20 or $30K per ounze. However Bitcoin is clearly a competition, and has acted as  a black hole absorbing a lot of money.
Schiff is right in a way that electronic currency is still subject to the psychological war.... At the end of the year there will be a trident of Bitcoins (BTC, BTC Cash, and BTCx2), and market will suffer for that and there is no room for the global acceptance of three bitcoins.

Assuming Satoshi was one person, then Satoshi has clearly been a high IQ tech/IT pro, usually this is achieved through a lot of years of experience. Someone needs to guess his age and I will take an uneducated guess that his age was between 40-50 years. If you were to add additional 8 years, he would be approx 50-60.  At that age mortality risk is growing and there is a good chance we will always be kept in suspense, because he is either dead or people who control the private keys (if any) are just waiting it out.
And no, highly unlikely, that Alan Greenspan would have anything to do with the blockchain. He has sold his soul a long time ago.

All miners have fast internet connection, the costs are fixed.
All business know that some of the activity is not necessarily bringing the margin.
Success of the miners directly relies and is dependent on the success of the users. As such, fee spamming and minimum fee has and will backfire. 
Bitcoin already has a ton of competition.
