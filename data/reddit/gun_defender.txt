You are being paranoid, it isn't going to sink to 500, and if it does that is a great opportunity to buy more.  Just don't panic sell if it dips to 700, that would be a big mistake.

Sorry but you can't possibly convince people this isn't a scam.  It's like the Eve online lottery, the guy built trust for a year until it was huge then ran away with one huge payout.  If this gets to the point where you hold millions of dollars worth of bitcoins, you will steal it.  No one is that ethical.  You may think you don't want to steal it, but when it is staring you in the face and you have access to that kind of money you will break.

Low volatility is VERY good for merchant adoption and people using it as a currency instead of an investment. It encourages people to spend, rather than hoard.
If you want it to be worth $5000 at the end of 2014, you want it to hold stable for a while so more people will adopt it.  The crazy bubble/burst cycle may seem like fun for a speculator, but it doesn't inspire confidence in it as a currency.
I would be happy if we can go another few months before the next bubble/burst.

You still have your karma.  You "redeemed" it for something of value, and you can only do that once.  Now you have money and karma!

To me that screams malware on your pc. You should download malwarebytes and run a scan, I bet you have a keylogger. They would infect a bunch of people, get their info, and steal all the coins at once.

Actually you're wrong, the mods have automod set to remove comments from people with low karma. 
That means that he actually isn't banned from this sub, he can comment, but the comments will be automatically removed so no one can see them.  That produces a shadow ban type effect within this particular subreddit.

I just want cryptsy to impliment a stop loss auto sell function, so it can auto convert coins if the value tanks for one or the other.
Actually, I should just write a program to do this on cryptsy, this could make me a lot of money.

I was just talking with two of my coworkers and they are convinced the government will make transacting in bitcoins illegal, thereby destroying the value.  This will be a great thing to show them that points in the other direction, that the government considers transacting in bitcoins to be perfectly legitimate and legal.

Because selling wow gold for USD is hard (not that hard, but harder than spending btc).
And no one cares about the tos.

No, he will have lost $1 and .0017 or so BTC. That btc might be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars at that point.
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:23:22
Altcoins are a good investment too.

Correct, you can only redeem 500 comment karma.  More than 500 doesn't matter.
You are getting free money from a very generous redditor!

People selling mtgox coins on other exchanges, getting out of mtgox.  Now, why is mtgox price dropping? No idea.

I just think we need to stop thinking about the value of btc purely in USD. If the USD collapses entirely in 4 years (unlikely I know), that .0017 BTC will still be worth .0017 BTC. 
No matter what happens to the dollar he is risking 1 USD and .0017 BTC, not 2 USD.  And yes, it is semantics, but I think it is important in terms of how we think about and value BTC.  As long as BTC is only valued for its' current USD exchange rate, it isn't really a currency.  Once people start valuing goods and services in BTC it will have broken through a new barrier, and I think that will happen in the next 4 years.  His .0017 BTC might be worth 4 pizzas, and we might not care what the USD equivolent of the BTC actually is.

You can buy back in at a lower price, theoretically, if you notice in time before it goes back up.

Which is why it is now $700 a bitcoin and why it will keep rising in the long term. They are very useful.

+.5 USD verify
Now you will be able to find out.
@_date: 2014-03-17 03:38:09
Try that for starters, that will get you a tiny amount of BTC and a bitcointip wallet, then you can give them to redditors the same way I just did, or you can withdraw them to an external address.
+.5 USD verify
Now you have a wallet.

It is already true, you can buy a machine gun shipped to your door, along with your heroin, anonymously online.  How much more utility do you need?
$4000 by the end of this year for sure.

I don't trust BTC more than USD, I trust nothing and like to hedge my bets.
I do have a lot of faith in the BTC network, and in the US government, but I don't take things purely on faith.  Every system fails on a long enough time frame.

How does this make money? How can they afford to give 1000 free satoshi for sign ups?
I want to do it, but I'm worried.  The business model doesn't make sence, seems like they will run with our BTC once they get a lot.

First I think you need to specify which gun control policies you support so we can explain why they are a bad idea.
Gun control is a very broad topic, and almost everyone supports some gun control.  Not too many people want to get rid of the law against violent felons possessing firearms, or the law against manufacturing an rpg without a license, or the law against branidshing without justification.
Typically the sticky points are the machine gun ban, the NFA, the proposed assault weapon bans, the open carry ban, record keeping which forms a de facto registry (which was part of the recent universal background check bill but doesn't have to be implimented for universal background checks to function), private sales, and the gun free zones such as the campus carry ban.  Which of those controls do you support?

Not all cryptocurrencies swing the same as BTC. While BTC goes down, sometimes doge or other currencies are still going up.
I'm not so worried about the BTC swings in USD value, I know it will keep going up in the medium term.
The problem with your idea is determining when to buy back in and when to stay out.  Say you buy at 800, and it goes up to 850, then down to 840 and your program sells. Lets say your program buys back in at 100 down, and it goes down to 740 and you buy back in. Then it tanks to 730, and your program auto sells again.  Then, rather than going down more, it shoots back up to 900. Your program won't buy back in, cause it didn't drop more.  You end up with no BTC and a significant loss of USD if you buy back in at 900.
You also are ignoring the trading fees you must pay with each sale, which narrow the margins.

I'm just saying he is risking the actual BTC itself, they might never be recoverable, he is not risking the current USD value of those BTC.
It would be like if I put a peice of gold in the envelope that is worth $1 today, I'm not risking $1, I'm risking the piece of gold.
I understand your logic, I'm just saying that it isn't 2 dollar bills in that envelope and to pretend that it is would be foolish.  The only way that makes sence is if he was either going to put the BTC in the envelope or sell it right now.  If the alternative of putting the BTC in the envelope was to keep it as BTC, very likely, then he risked the BTC, not the current value of that BTC.

It will rise slowly like before,  maybe crash once, then bubble and crash again.
It will hit 100k in about 6 years I bet.

I don't get your issue. Dont use apps, they suck, use your phone browser, and you can set a custom fee for each send on blockchain.info
I use blockchain and coinbase, but I don't use apps for either, I use chrome for android.  Works great, I can do anything on my phone that I can do on my desktop.

It's like the california gold rush. A few big companies and lucky individuals made lots of money mining, but most of the small miners just bought equipment and ended up mining at a loss. The companies that really made the big cash are the ones who made and sold the equipment.

I've never been canceled, juat had to wait after my first buy to buy again. Never done a recurring buy, and now I'm fully verified with the 1btc instant buy. It is really nice.

The solution is to carry a gun and shoot him.
And more than one wallet, where you don't have access to most of your funds, but he might think you are lying and kill you anyway, hense your own gun being the better option.
At some point loosing all your money is better than dying, and it is better to keep him happy, very happy, if you are going the compliance route.

They are coming, very soon.  
But you don't need that for a good self defense gun, just build a [pipe gun](  The only thing you need to aquire illegally is a single 12 ga shotgun shell (or a few if you want reloads) which you can buy illegally online with bitcoins.
They can be small enough to conceal comfortably, and they pack a serious punch at close range.
If you are more the anarchist type.

There will never be a legit version because they can't tax it, so governments will never allow it.
