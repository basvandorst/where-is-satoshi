The same can be said of Bitcoin, can't it?
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:00:47
That is part of why I didn't tell anybody that I own crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:44:51
Sure, have fun convincing yourself that the average person who buys bitcoin understands what they are doing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:22:33
*Yes please* Fuck central banks and fuck banks in general. Also fuck politicians. We need a financial infrastructure that is out of their reach.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:56:57
It's bullshit Bitcoin politics. BCash is one of the large amounts of scammy bitcoin shitforks. This one in particular was created for the benefit of a few rich bitcoin miners (if you're interested, read up on ASICBOOST), but lately they have been getting it into their heads that BCash should replace Bitcoin. They are a bit salty though because their attempts have failed and a lot of them are holding heavy bags (BCash bought at high prices). BCash will fade away in the long term just like all other moneygrab Bitcoin forks.
Personally, I am not invested into either Bitcoin or BCash, but if the BCash cult succeeded in crashing BTC like they want to, they will destroy the savings of hundreds of thousands of people and along with it the entire crypto ecosystem for years to come. Not that they stand much of a chance.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:22:35
BCash :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:05:42
Maybe it is not a bad idea to increase block size. Keep in mind though that bcash does not have the amount of transactions that BTC has. My main problem with bcash is more that they want to crash bitcoin, which would wreck the entire crypto ecosystem. Also I hate all the politics around who gets to control Bitcoin and what it does to the ecosystem as a whole. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:44:57
Nope, I'm not that rich, but still I would do it in increments and not risk it all at once.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:15:04
I'm a bit sad for them though. A lot of them are newbies and they lost a lot of their savings. They must be distraught right now.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:14:55
Have fun with your BCash bags while everything else is skyrocketing. All the salt and tears from the people who tried to wreck the entire crypto ecosystem when BCash crashes or goes into a slow decline to its death will be delicious.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:44:23


Wish it worked that way.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:29:10
All you have to do is hold it and not do anything dumb with it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:47:50
"BCash is a delusional cult". How is that?
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:38:52
I hope so and I hope it scales properly so that everyone can stop whining about BTC's transaction speeds and costs.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:14:40
You should've read r/btc during the weekend where bcash got its major pump. They want it to replace BTC, which would require it to crash and then bcash to take over its market value. They had also published a manifesto about what they were going to do, and the stated intention was for btc to crash and for bcash to take its place.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:34:19
If it were me, I'd say it depends on how early I could retire. Also I'd live frugally to save as much money as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:33:57
I don't feel sorry for them if they are stupid enough to do *that*. And they didn't even research their huge investment to find out that the bitcoin market is incredibly volatile. Never borrow money to gamble with it. That's completely ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:09:33
I would never put that much money no an exchange. When I cash out, it is in smaller increments.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:07:28
Just about every crypto in the top 20 has lower fees and faster transaction times than BTC, though most of them have not had to deal with BTC's transaction volume. That does not mean that they can just replace BTC. If BTC were to crash, it would take investor confidence and the entire crypto ecosystem down along with it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:06:40
Not me, if I had 7 figures I would not be stressed at all 99.9999% of the time, barring incidents like family deaths.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:58:38


You're wrong, BCash is a fork designed to benefit a few rich miners.
You might as well pick any of the other Bitcoin forks and call them "the real Bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:27:57
I think it depends on the person. All my life I've had trouble interacting with people and getting enjoyment from it. Just give me riches and I'll spend the rest of my life happily traveling the world and playing video games.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:37:54
Just out of curiosity, who is mining the testnet so that you can make transactions on it? Aren't they wasting a lot of energy?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:38:57
Not everyone has parts of their life that they count themselves as being blessed in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:22:36
Sure, believe in something and it will come true. That's how the world works. Maybe you should go tell that to all the billions of starving people in the world.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:58:05
A proper correction for BTC would be more like 80% of value lost for a few weeks and the person from your little essay putting a shotgun in his mouth instead of sweating, puking and shitting himself.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:18:30
Yeah, Bitcoin not making 100% gains every week or 2 clearly means something is wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:41:17
Do you guys think that demand will decrease when average Joe can only afford small fractions of BTC anymore? There's something psychologically satisfying about owning whole ones...
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:50:17
Ether already took off.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:44:16
BCash taking over? Strongly doubt that as well.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:36:01
Make sure the rockets are real and not made of paper.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:46:48
Sometimes people just want to sell their crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:39:11
Projection: The Comment. You guys are the delusional ones with statements like "Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin.". Which is clearly not the case in anyone's eyes except for irrational BCash cultists who can't accept reality.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:08:27
I do now as well. But I had no idea BTC would blow up 100,000x. Otherwise I'd be a billionaire now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:49:26
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:31:54
Tbh crypto's are easier to steal and almost no risk of ever getting it retrieved by the law if you can force the owner to give you keys. They might make a better target that fiat and gold. Also easier to obfuscate.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:34:45
Actually it is, it'll just be an expensive coffee.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:10:58
Nah, this just states why SegWit2X is a bad idea, and assumes that the people behind those corporations will act rationally instead of with their egos, greed and hunger for power. That is not a given at all.
edit: lol.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:41:48
*unless its 0.07 btc
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:27:46
If you transfer BTC to another address, wouldn't it show the public address that you sent it to on Bitcoin websites? Thus never being able to hide the money?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:51:31
If you had told the guys at the beginning that BTC would reach $10,000, they would have called you insane. I think it's unlikely that BTC will reach $1,000,000 but not absurd. Market cap doesn't mean that people put that amount in by the way. All it shows is how many coins there are and what people are willing to pay for them. In the future, people will buy fractions of BTC instead of whole BTC. If BTC doesn't collapse and another crypto takes its place.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:18:48
Yeah but those events won't happen just because BTC has been going up for too long.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:32:50
Many years ago I was just fucking around with BTC mining, not really knowing what I was doing. I mined a bunch of BTC but of course I didn't record the private address. I didn't even know how that worked back then. BTC was worth very little back then. I don't remember how much I mined. It was on a computer that is long gone now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:55:18
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:30:49
You're an idiot for holding that much money on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:29:04
I think getting your coffee payment cleared through the entire planet is actually a cool thing.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:16:35
No, 2X died because the community didn't allow it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:58:28
25,000 BTC is nothing compared to all the BTC that he has. He's not dumping everything at all.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:55:52
Everyone is acting like BTC crashes will happen just because of BTC's massive gains, but that's not how it works. BTC crashes always have strong real world motivations behind them (not talking about small cyclical dips).
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:34:51
If the panic causes a big price drop, it's probably better to buy in the resulting dip.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:41:32
For people who bought in last week, 10k is not the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:39:41
Nah... you need to own a private wallet, otherwise you don't actually own the Bitcoin. Also coinbase is evil because it's complicit in the corporate segwit2x BTC takeover attempt.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:45:11
You bought $100 of bitcoin hoping it will become enough to buy a house with? I have far more than that but I don't even dream of it growing that much...
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:14:22
For you it is. For us poor guys who only got into it in 2017 and could only afford a small amount of BTC, the moon is a lot higher.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:46:42
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:58:57
It'll probably be easier reaching 10x with an altcoin... though they're more unpredictable.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:55:20
Maybe. But if I had really understood BTC, I might have purchased a lot of BTC and leave my savings there just because I don't like banks.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:18:37
Not that many people can afford to spend over $5000 on a cryptocurrency, really...
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:17:52
You chose bad timing.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:44:22
Probably more like military invasion rather than economic blockade.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:39:02
Obviously because the value of BTC is falling quickly now. You'd have been able to buy more BTC if you had waited until the dip ended.
