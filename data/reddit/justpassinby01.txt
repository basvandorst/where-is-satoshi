I just received this message with the subject "You are being trolled" :


OP: What do you say about this?
@_date: 2015-06-11 22:50:42
Yeah right... 
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:28:12
Shit. Another positive story...

Well, I understand they have issues, but OP is lying here... I have never had any problems transferring bitcoin in and out of their APP and website.
I am using e-coin (now wirex) for almost an year and I never had any serious concerns. I do admit I had some issues, but their support fixed my problems every single time.
*edit: double negation*

Love the interface and the BTC rates seem pretty reasonable. Would love to see other payment methods accepted (such as credit cards, neteller etc.)

Or maybe remember your 12-word seed. Nothing to shove up your butt in this case :) .
Option  arrive in US and recover your encrypted wallet backup.
and the list can go on...
Are they really that stupid to put a bill like this? Yes and no! They know you can easily hide it. They just want to be covered, just in case...
