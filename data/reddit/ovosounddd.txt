ok got it thanks for the clearup... for some reason while I was watching a few youtube videos on wallets I thought that I would actually get a super long string of characters as a private key somewhere if I wasnt using a paper wallet. 
And I actually do plan on keeping both currencies in the future because I truly am on the fence when it comes to the pros/cons of both the block size increase vs segwit and possible future forks but right now I want to use the bch money and move it to other cryptos

im a little lost... so I have a certain amount of bitcoin in my blockchain.info wallet right. I have the 12 phrase seed. Now say i want to sell my bitcoin cash from the fork, how exactly would I go about doing this? Im looking down this thread and people are saying restore your bitcoin wallet to an app or wallet that supports bch but for that i need a private key and im looking all over the app but I cant seem to find a private key?

so I cant just tell blockchain.info to forget the address?
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:14:36
why would I do that because I already have an electrum wallet. I would have to pay 1-2 dollar tx fee for no reason? is there any way to just force blockchain to forget the acc?

could you explain what bip 39 is? i did some googling and theres just so many of them idgi
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:27:25
lmao sorry if i sound really confused. I just thought that you could brute force unplug a wallet info if you had the backup phrase to recover it on a diff wallet

so I was able to transfer both my regular btc to electrum and get bcc from electron but i can still access the wallet from blockchain wallet and there is no way to unpair the wallet on the website only the phone app
