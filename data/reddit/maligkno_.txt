can some one help me sor this out?
there is a huge discrepancy in the curret usa market price of bitcoin, in coin base its at 318000 mxn(mexican peso) and the site i use bitso its at 354000 mxn, thats a difrence of 36000 pesos, sometimes even more like 45k, divided betwen the current exchange (19.23) that amounts to 2335 usd, thats insane, i could just have some crazy american send me coin to my bitso wallet and deposit to my account and profit
