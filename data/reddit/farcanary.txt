A store of value should also be unconfiscatable and uncensorable. I consider these more important than price stability.

IMO Anti Money Laundering regulations were created by the banks, so their purpose is to enrich the banks, not stop money laundering. AML stops people using cash, which is a competitor to the banks. Also AML forces money launderers to use complex financial services which the banks can charge for.

This is wrong - it should be about 6 Billion Troy ounces. This changes your calculation quite a bit.

If you want a brain wallet, use a standard 12 word seed, and mentally place the words at points along a journey you make frequently.
(I would recommend a paper backup as well though).

Might be worth adding that any payment mechanism that you can imagine can be added to Bitcoin as a second layer. Its easy for Bitcoin to scale, the real question is what is the best way for Bitcoin to scale.

Awesome. This video should have its own post.

Probably worth mentioning that bitcoin is in the process of taking over the $600 billion dollar remittance industry.

My limited understanding is that:
bc1 addresses have slightly lower transaction fees.
3... addresses have better backwards compatibility (more things can send to these addresses.)

QE is where the government creates money out of nothing and gives it to rich people.

It should be pretty easy for people to switch their savings into a physically backed gold etf (if they don't want to go all in on bitcoin.) Some only have a 0.25% fee.

Bitcoin is an open community. The bitcoin software is the software that the community uses to record and regulate transactions between members.

Is it possible to use [purse.io]( to earn/buy small amounts of bitcoin without kyc? (I haven't tried it).

The monopoly game might be more realistic if nobody has any paper money, but player B notes down how much money each player has. Player B then adjusts each player's number as they spend and receive money. Player B can lend to players just by increasing their number.

So if I have a stash of btc as an investment, and I get my income in btc, then  I have to pay income tax on my income, then capital gains tax when I spend my income (because of the pooling)?
However if I arranged to have my income paid in an alt coin I wouldn't have to pay any significant capital gains tax on it?
Is the UK government promoting alt coins?
