No, losing means you've irrecoverably lost that money.  Gaining means you've guaranteed made money.  Til then it's in limbo. 
Like if I spend $20000 on a car.  If it gets totalled and I don't have insurance, I lost 20000.  If it becomes a collectable for some reason, then maybe it'll sell for 50k, so I gain 30k.
If the car gets many years of use, then I didn't lose the money, it just evened out.

I heard that there's a difference, considering how people always say "transfer your coins from Coinbase (app) to gdax before selling so you don't have to pay a fee"
Maybe the issue is that the company (Coinbase) named its app after itself (Coinbase).
Kinda like how you can't really use Google (the engine) to check your email, but you CAN just Google (the company) to check your email via Chrome or Gmail. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:09:21
Well, the problem isn't the crypto, it's cashing it in or out. 
The only legitimate issue I can see with crypto is I can get a million bucks illegally, cash it in for bit coins, then use the coins to withdraw money in smaller amounts and not be caught.  You can also do this with other stuff like gold, but at least it's more obvious when someone is transporting lots of illegal gold around.

The transactions are not private, the ownership is.  It's like cash.  You can see a receipt that I bought something with cash.  But you won't see that the cash was mine.  And if someone steals it (like NiceHash), I can't get it back because I can't prove it's mine.

Exactly. But go to the appstore and you can find a nongdax exchange called Coinbase. Right now it only supports bitcoin, ltc, ethereum, real cash, and bc cash.  It's a blue themed program.  I'd link a screenshot, but it has some kind of weird anti screenshot power. 
What I'm wondering is if this blue colored program will have ripple, or only gdax
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:23:41

I'm pretty sure the answer is no, but if I'm transferring money from slushpool.com to my coin base, I pay about $1 to slushpool.com (which is fine),  and then I pay another 1% to Coin base,  which is also reasonable,  if I cash out on gdax, does that mean I don't pay the 1%? 
Realistically it doesn't matter since my asic makes about 1000 bucks a month,  and I don't mind supporting coin base for $10 a month,  but just curious

It's because they use bitcoin in their name.   No one thinks ethereum is bad or that they're a bitcoin.  No one thinks litecoin is bad, or that they're ripping off bitcoin.
And then you have bitcoin cash, trying to act like it's bitcoin (especially when the initials are bc, making you think of BitCoin).

@_date: 2017-11-06 08:22:35
Ok, and I think that litecoin might take over because of a not yet discovered flaw that'll bankrupt bitcoin, but doesn't affect litecoin. 
So if I'm right, will you quote me in 2020 saying "what do you mean no one saw that lite coin would be $5000 a pop? There was even a reddit post showing it!"

I believe there is a possibility of a god, so while I don't fornicate or steal or drink alcohol, I also believe in risk assessment, so I'm not going to give up all my money to my mosque just because there's a chance it might be totally worth it if I'm right.
Likewise, I threw in $3000 into bitcoin because I can begrudgingly recover from that in a year or so if bitcoin goes out of business so to speak (whatever you'd call the word for "no one uses bitcoin anymore" or "it gets hacked and is pointless to use"), but can't recover if I got a loan.
So yeah, I believe in bitcoin eventually being worth 8 or 9k but I don't believe in it enough to spend all my money. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:12:20
It's probably insurance by the company to make up for if, for example, Bitcoin goes "bankrupt" (like if a coin costs $500, meaning the $20 worth of coins that you paid when it was $8000 is now worth like a few cents).

Lost money is better imo, as long as it's recoverable from.
The $500 I could have put into the coin 5 years ago sucks so much more than the $200 I thought I lost from when btc went down from like $7000 to like $6200 a coupla days ago.
But if I'd put in $20k and lost it all, I can't quite recover from that, so it'd have been worse than not getting the millions that BTC could have been worth.

Back in September, I started bitcoining.  Price went from like 5500 to 4000, I think.  Then jumped to $5000ish.
Made a post in my class discussion forum saying something like "it's a risk, but if you have investment money lying around, do research on Bitcoin.  I just made like $150 profit and it's rising".
TA responded saying something like "it's purely speculative, akin to gambling" and so on.  He wasn't rude about it, and what he said was true, but he had a "don't do it" tone so to speak.
Well, if anyone listened to me, they doubled their money lol

Can probably confirm.  Preordered an s9 ($2200) and also bought another $400 in bitcoin yesterday at like $7400 (on top of my existing $450 from when it was like $5800) in hopes that it'll profit me like $200 when we get free gold coins, but the price is already falling instead of increasing (I'm aware it fluctuates) and it'll probably be back at $4000 with my luck when my bitminer arrives, not to mention that's assuming my machine even works long enough to be worth anything (or wasn't a scam where I don't get my product). 
I guess we'll find out the first part in a week, and the second in a month. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:14:25

I think you're joking but in case you're not:
Person A starts with 10k.  He buys 1 million penny stocks in a biotech company because the ticker name is funny (let's make believe it's $cunt).  A month later the company is bought out by pfizer. Stock is now $10 each.  Guy has 10 million dollars now (too lazy to double check mental math).
Person B starts with 10k.  Goes to college.  Has degree now and -50k due to debt.  Makes 85k a year.
Let's face it, is the millionaire really the guy to listen to?

Fair.  Only reason I support my view is because I like closure and I know for a fact what would have happened because, well, it happened. 
The alternative, "i could have been a millionaire, what would I have done with the money?" would never be answered.  Technically, one could say I might feel like "oh hey I won a million dollars, I wonder what would have happened if I was still poor?", but even then I could know by not touching my money.

@_date: 2017-11-08 08:52:29
Well, the logical move is to sell both the bitcoins (at about $7k) and the sedjewick (for a few dollars or cents probably; I highly doubt it'll be doubling our money) or whatever it's called since I have a feeling that it'll crash to like $5000 quickly.  THEN when you think it's hit the low point, you use your $7000x level of money to buy $5000x levels of btc so that you have a few more coin pieces.
Of course, I could be wrong and maybe they'll just make the coins go up to 10k in which case I played myself.

@_date: 2017-09-23 00:02:08
I don't think you understand.  Look at this objectively.  Just play along, then you can continue acting righteous if you want.
Let's say you only have $500 available to buy anything. 
Ok, lemme put it all in bitcoin.  Looking at the market right now, that'll get me $500/3621 = 0.138083402375034 bitcoins.
Realistically, we can expect the $3621 coin to be worth about $3800 in a day or so if it's a realistic "average good rise". My $500 will be worth $524.  It's about a 5% rise.
Now lemme buy my lite coins, which are, right now, 48.20.  For $500 I can buy 10.37344398340248 lite coins. 
I can easily expect them to go to $55 in a few days.  That gives me about $570, or a 15% rise.
You can easily expect a $7 rise in price, despite being a huge percent.  I don't think you'll see huge rises in bitcoin in short periods of time - for bitcoin to give me the same profit, that would mean it has to rise about $500.  I find it more likely to see a 15% rise in litecoin in a week than a 15% increase in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:51:15
I have it on good authority that a^2+ b^2 = e/m
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:10:20
You're right, there's a huge difference between percent growth and linear growth.  But what I'm saying is that it's far more likely for $100 worth of litecoin to double your money than for $100 worth of bitcoin to do the same, simply because of the linear values ($50 increase in ltc = $3500 increase in bitcoin when it comes to a specific value of invested money).
That said, obviously if you can only keep the profit of selling a percent of profit from a single coin vs the same percent for selling a bitcoin, the bitcoin is obscenely better.  But that's a stupid example since the coin is worth 700x more anyway. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:50:13

@_date: 2017-09-22 20:35:49
Ooooo I can answer that (being an impartial investor in both)!
Litecoin is worth much less per coin, so any positive fluctuation in price is a huge gain, and any negative fluctuation is not as bad.
That is to say, let's say I bought 2 bitcoins.  I spend $7000.  The price goes up $200.  Cool.  I just made $400. 
Ok, let's say I bought $7000 worth of $50 bitcoin. That's like 150ish coins (estimate in my head).  Let's say my coins went up only $100 instead of $200.  So 150 coins times $150 = $22500.  Despite only going up half as much as bitcoin.
That said, i dunno any other advantages.

Actually, now that you bring it up, I'm not sure what bit coin has to do with it if the house is at stake.  Maybe the bank just wants to know assets so they can see if you can afford it since it's a hassle to sell your house.
Like, if i have $500 in the bank and a $20k job, then they know I can't afford a $500,000 loan.

If you want a truly honest response?  Since I only barely started in September after Chase temporarily lowered the price, and as such am new  - I'd keep it in coinbase.  I've traded about $2000 worth and haven't bought a nano because I'm too poor to work with huge numbers.

@_date: 2017-09-22 22:52:28
I hope you're also aware that it doesn't change my explanation.  If you spend $500 on a piece of a bitcoin and the price spikes by like $500, you get like $20 selling it.  You spend $500 on "a piece" of a litecoin (10/2, so 5 pieces), then you make $2500.
Think of it this way - remember when bitcoin was like $50?  Was it better to buy them back them and sell when they went to $2000?
Or to buy bitcoin with the same amount of money you had, but when it's $3500 and sell when it goes up to $5000?
(hint: the answer is the former because you get a lot more shares and that lets you grow your profit)
A simple example:
Lets say i have a sword and a gun.  Which is better?  The gun obviously because it's like 10 times stronger.
Let's say instead someone let me have either 7 swords (with wielders) or one revolver.  The swords would win barely since the gun person only gets 6 shots. 
Now let's say some sort of deal happens and I can quadruple both. 
So now i have 4 guns (24 bullets) vs 28 sword dudes. 
Not the most amazing example, but hopefully it makes sense why smaller shares, but more quantity can lead to greater profits.

@_date: 2017-10-26 17:19:47
To find out what it would be, here's the formula:

Number of coins * $5700 = current value 
Edit: just realized you put old coin value at $1.  So following that formula, it's about 2.8 million.

@_date: 2017-10-05 20:25:21
If they keep doing what they're doing right now, it should be around for a long time.  Make the price fluctuate like crazy, like back in middle of September, and it'll be fun and worth gambling on.  I bought like 8 litecoins at $55 so right now I'm losing, but I'm hoping they raise the price again to like $65.  Then I'll sell and buy again when they're like $50
I could do that for years.

@_date: 2017-10-08 13:52:30
Yeah, isn't the internet like really successful now? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:48:22
Let's be somewhat realistic.  Let's say I bought $1000 worth as a joke back then, which comes out to about 250 coins. 
Realistically could I have expected to have $1.2 million dollars pending in my bank account? Or would coinbase or other companies be like "lol, we can't pay that"? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:53:50
Sixteen million I think
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:49:01
I mean, that's $3000 profit right now - a tenth of my total debt
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:55:59
Because if you buy when it's cheap and you sell when it's expensive, you max profits. 
(only way it's more profitable is to make it for free)

What difference does it make if my main issue was heat and noise? 
The slowness was just another issue to add on to why I don't mine with a nonasic
@_date: 2019-09-13 16:18:20
Because they keep changing the price of it.  Same reason people don't use stocks for the most part to pay for stuff.
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:08:59
Correct.  Stocks are a type of gamble, just in this subset you get to gamble with other people who get to see the history and you can modify your bet anytime.

Obligatory "I'm you from the future, unless butterfly effect, you must buy some now so you can sell at 10x in a decade"

Litecoin is only $55 right now.  It might go up crazy high some day. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:41:03
I mean, i had like $200 when I was six.  If I bought bitcoin when it was $10 and if it was around, I'd have like $100,000 be retire for like five years!  
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:46:29
I thought there were only 21 million in total.  At least that's what I saw somewhere in the sub. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:18:34
Cool, so you're saying I can't buy a percent of 100% of bitcoin and then try to sell it at a profit on the market when the line chart begins to go up (or become penniless when the line goes really low for a long time)?
Face it, it works just like the stock market on the money side of things, as I said before.
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:15:30
Very nice, good to know
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:37:22
I'll be happy if it reaches 20k again.  Actually, I'd be happier if the difficulty goes down.  :/
My s9 is almost worthless lol
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:36:15
Obviously it has to do with the valence electrons and orbitals.  See, in certain electron configurations, there are upspins and downspins and.... Well, ok, fine, physicists have no idea either. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:38:35
And heaven points. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:38:17
Boom, roasted.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:43:54
The difference is this time around, everyone knows what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:41:01
It's worth it in the long run since it makes money
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:39:40
It's pretty simple.  You simply block chain and public ledgers, maybe some Bitmain S9 ASIC here and there, and crypto Sha 256 (or was it scrypt?) and voila, Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:45:20
You're thinking of chaste titties
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:01:47
Ah, I guess you do know how it works.  Why'd you reply as if losing negative 3000 poke dollars was a bad thing?
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:53:28
I mean, it used to be true at one point. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:42:14
I don't think you understand how negative losses work
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:35:46
Got me there, but you know what I meant lol
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:36:13
Half a century ago was at one point
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:06:13
My belief was that it was more likely for a $250 ltc to hit $400 than for a 20k Bitcoin to hit 35k or whatever the rate is.  Same reason I like cheap $0.10 stocks.  
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:12:53
The -er says, the irony completely lost to him. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:37:02
It's not idiot proof 
"Hey you're late on rent.  Pay me right now."
"Oh shit, can I go to the ATM next door?"
"Ok, hurry up"
"Here's $500."
"Thanks.  You're lucky I'm in a good mood.  Get out of my sight or I'll charge you the late fee."
"Sure, sorry"
Next day:
"You owe me $500"
"What?  I paid you yesterday"
"No you didn't"
"What the hell, is this a joke?"
"No, give me $500 or I'm suing you"
"I'LL SUE YOU.  I HAVE PROOF THAT I WITHDREW $500.  HA"
"And where's your proof that you supposedly gave it to me?  I want my $500."
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:00:23
Well of course you haven't. That's the point.

My personal belief is to buy it at the lowest price ever, and then sell it at the highest point it'll ever be.  Unfortunately, my problem is I dunno who gets to set the price and how to ask him what the highest price will be (and when, though it doesn't matter if I know what number to look for), so I just guess.
