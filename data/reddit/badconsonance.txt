Well you could try buying with a cc on changelly or changenow and maybe those transactions will go through.

I see it as more of a market correction really. But i would love to see the price drop down to ~8300 it would give me an opportunity to reduce my cost basis ��so i hope it crashes further down.

What the specific situation we are in right now? Low usage?

Some credit card providers are beginning to refuse all crypto related transactions due to “high risk of fraud” �� I even called and told them its fine i trust the exchange and want to allow the transactions but apparently they are just refusing all crypto transactions across the board regardless of what the customer thinks.

What are some good decentralized exchanges that allow you to buy in with fiat? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:29:06
Yup they pay the fees, no reason to leave them on the exchange if you wanna hold, or buy alts on another exchange. Just triple check the address your sendings them to before you hit send.

Maybe, but credit card debut is some of the worst type of debt to have super high interest rates, its best to avoid it as much as possible. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:41:49
The way it should be ��
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:07:20
Damn your gonna use a T5 on your Pi?? Bit overkill no? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:55:21
No i moved everything into a segwit wallet with hopes high fees issue would be resolved but i’ve not found that to be the case. Im going to stay on he segwit wallet and hope things get better with time. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:21:04
Yes, I’m guessing you tried using a credit card?

my only problem with a paper wallet is that people think they are super secure, but they are only as secure as the steps you take to make them as secure as possible. If created carelessly, your private keys be stolen and whoever holds he private keys owns the funds. A hardware wallet stores you private keys securely on a chip and never exposes them when conducting transactions. As opposed to a paper wallet once you need to make an outgoing transaction you have to type your private key and thats exposes you to hacks. Im not saying that a hardware wallet is unhackable, i don’t believe anything is, but its safer that a paper wallet imo. but paper wallets are good low cost alternatives, I considered using them to hold, but decided that the price of the hardware wallet was well worth the money.

Ledger nano s is also a good idea if you want to buy and store some alt coins.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:02:28
Hardware wallet if your a hodler
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:02:24
Hardware ledger nano s
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:21:41
Probably because fees are still too damn high. I tried it the other day and the fee was still in the low 20s. ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:20:02
Do you have a site where you sell them?
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:03:17
�� 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:32:57
Would you mind telling us how it happened?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:37:11
Thats weird i swear i saw the notification for the link i asked for, but as soon as i opened up the app it disappeared. I can’t find it anywhere on the post. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:03:41
Why not just use a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:06:59
I knew i wasn’t crazy! Lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:44:07
�� i can’t believe its doing it again... but luckily i wised up and screenshot the notification before opening it. Thanks for using a shortened link haha

Ledger Nano S is really the best option imo, especially if you plan to hold any alt coins. 
But trezor just released an updated version of the trezor hardware wallet, promises  upcoming support for new coins via software updates, and its got a nice updated color touchscreen and does away with the horrible old way of unlocking the older trezor.
I personally own and love the ledger nano s, and it will be easier to get since i imagine the trezor is all sold out for a few months. 
Edit: the original trezor was at a nice discount on amazon last time i checked so that might be a great price to value buy. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:19:27
Why not just use a privacy coin like monero or dash?
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:12:38
How does that argument apply to the crypto market? You can’t just equate drinks at a music festival to crypto currencies like bitcoin. But i think i get what your getting at, if the exchanges all of a sudden decided they don’t want to accept USDT anymore then your fkd, because Tether sure as hell won’t buy it back from you.

Scam, please stay away.

It kinda pains me to say it but companies that are going to raise investment funds for development of new blockchain based technologies need to be strictly regulated. I don’t see any other way to prevent them from tainting the space and the public’s perception of crypto as a whole.
