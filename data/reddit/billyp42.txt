was  on my screen earlier today. So wild.

Congrats! That's an awesome success story, you made it. Don't forgot to report it on your taxes tho..

0 is still better than .25 or .1 (just use limit orders, always)

forgot to put that. Of course. Zero or a million, I don't really care. (prefer the latter but whatever)

yeah fuck yeah, a house sounds good. I just recently sold enough btc (not much) to get back my initial $2k investment. NOW HODL (including all alts)

Awesome! You hit your moon and all that matters.

I tried talking my GF's 62 yo dad into buying $1k with me back in June. If he had followed my lead, it'd be worth ~$8k right now. 
He's tech savvy too but hates/doesnt understand or trust BTC.

I can actually control the fee from my Ledger wallet and really considered dropping it to 1/10 of the $85 fee but didn't want to have it stuck for hours/a day since the whole point was to catch the run-up-to-19k price. (that, for now, obviously came and went).
Thanks for the detailed explanation, though. I think I see the problem with BTC now all of a sudden. Good example: I managed to send and sell 1/3 of my LTC stack the other night the same way (from ledger to coinbase) and it only cost _25 cents_. And was there in &lt;18 minutes. :/

concern might be the wrong word but it's the right sentiment. It's exciting that everyone in the world is finding out about it now, and are interested enough to dip a toe in. I just kinda also see it as a cautious sign.

tried to sell 10% of mine during the 18-19k run up last week and A) coinbase was fucked and locked down but B) the fees to send it back to CB from my wallet was $85. 
No. Fucking. Way. Not paying that.

I get your sarcasm but I sure wish I'd bought into that IPO, I'll say that much.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:11:18
that's very sweet of her but I'd hate to see how much in fees she has paid in order to get that $30 balance. I bet it's pretty bad.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:01:34
Good for you, man. I'd be beyond excited to pay off my house with BTC gains, too. You did good.

Any chance of being able to buy via limit orders in GDAX, thereby slipping Coinbase fees? Had to ask! Excited to sign up and try it out, either way.
