Sorry, but that's not how it works.  It is always upon the end user to keep accurate records.  I've learned the hard way that you can't just count on the web record, you need to keep your own paper copies.

From what I know, they're friendly towards one another, but they're largely distributed both across the US and the world so to say they're Friday night drinking buddies would probably be a bit of a stretch.

75% of the past 1000 blocks.

There's no real way to enforce this.

We were talking about the Core Devs, not your family reunions. :)

They are known to have issues.  Use other sources.

There isn't a process.  Your only solution, unless a mod is breaking Reddit rules, is to unsubscribe.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:47:34
It fails due to a lack of referrer tag.  It happens with any block.  Let's not make any more conspiracy theories.
@_date: 2015-08-18 01:08:59
You would think.  There has been a bit of press on it though.  I suppose we'll have to watch it for say another week to see.

The internet is not a democracy.  You're always free to make a new subreddit if you disagree with how this one is being moderated.

Finally, a user figures it out.
@_date: 2015-10-01 06:08:28
Step 1) Realize that Chanserv removes chan op status from * is a generic statement and doesn't indicate who did what other than someone with an +o access line requested wumpus have the flag removed.  Only the person requesting and the person being acted on know who did what.
Step 2) Review  access rules and see that wumpus still has his access line and that it hasn't been modified in over 80 weeks.  This means nothing has been taken away.
Step 3) Apologize for wearing tinfoil hat outside of your basement.

So you don't have time to read the announcements for the software that holds your money?  Perhaps you should use a webwallet.
@_date: 2015-10-22 03:19:57
Running the daemon doesn't prevent the usage of the wallet.  You can still generate addresses and create transactions all from the command line.

I feel that the generic "censorship" gets thrown around now anytime there isn't a full throated endorsement of an idea.   365 net upvotes on that thread would seem to indicate it wasn't "censored."

Voting is what Reddit is all about though.  If you don't like the rules, don't play the game.

Who has time for release notes when there's reddit to be posted to?
@_date: 2015-10-01 06:13:31
I believe its the first few.
@_date: 2015-10-28 01:35:41
I almost asked what you meant by 300, then realized you meant price.
@_date: 2015-10-28 01:57:40
Don't worry, the $299 is because of the mental barrier that $300 has.  It's not completely your fault.... just mostly. /s
@_date: 2015-10-01 06:32:00
Admitting it is the first step.  Props for amending your statement for accuracy.
@_date: 2015-10-28 02:11:49
To clarify, once a post is moderated out, there's no way to undo that moderation.  The end user would need to resubmit, correct?
@_date: 2015-10-12 02:06:02
I figured that the sarcasm was obvious enough that it didn't require the flag.

There's a difference between reading the minutes from the Fed meeting and reading the announcement from the Fed meeting.

I wasn't trying to incite a pvp, just more along the lines that the article seemed very "teenage angst" to me.

If people can't be bothered to read the fine print, they shouldn't be upset about what happens.  If they don't understand the find print, they should find someone that does, but they certainly shouldn't just blindly agree to it.  To make things even worse, the release notes aren't even fine print, they are the CliffsNotes.  As I said before, if you a person doesn't take the time to read the announcements, they have no business using it.

The difference being that Luke-jr learned from it.  Will history repeat itself?
