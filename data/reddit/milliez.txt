Lol. Downvoted for the truth.  This sub has really gone to shit.
25 BTC are created every 10 minutes.  That's 3600 BTC per day.  At current valuation, that's ~2.9 million USD.
Some miners will hold, some will sell.  Assuming (a ridiculously conservative) 10% sell, that means nearly 300000 USD needs to come into BTC **every day** to maintain the current price.

You could very well be right, we don't know for sure.
But I believe if the means and incentives exist to do horrible things, then horrible things will happen.  That level of wealth inequality could certainly bring the means, and would be ripe for capture, as are congressmen today.

Thank-you for the thoughtful and intelligent post.  This is the best thing I've read on this sub in a while.  I agree with alot of what you said.


I think this insight is far too rare in this sub these days.  It's the *blockchain algorithm* that is really exciting.  Bitcoin is just one app that happens to use this novel algorithm.
The blockchain is the cypherpunk's wet dream.  They've already figured out how to conduct voting in a secure/tamper proof/coercion proof manner, now the blockchain allows them to add a tamper proof *currency* to any crazy (and fully-consensual) institution you can think of.
I maintain, [as outlined here]( If bitcoin were to obtain mass adoption, without **major** changes to it's wealth inequality, then it would be far more oppressive than the least oppressive states we have today.
That alone is enough to ensure it's (eventual) restriction.


Well I suppose this is the 21 million BTC question, isn't it?  Are the majority of the actors obedient or are they opportunistic?  I think it's naive to think people act according to rules or morals, but rather according to incentives.  And the incentives are surely there.  Even the largest decriers of bitcoin should have strong incentive to use it, and may do so covertly.

[This conversation again](
As OP states, fiat means 'by decree' or 'let it be done'.  The word has nothing to do with consent (that's legal tender).
Bitcoin is a fiat currency, because it exists *by decree* of 51% of the hashing power.  If 51% of the hashing power decided to change the block reward to 1000BTC *it would be done*.
@_date: 2014-04-16 21:40:44
So this goes against my understanding of how hardforks have been resolved in the past, but I'll defer to your expertise.
Buy my point still stands: Bitcoin is fiat, and fiat does not mean legal tender.
By your explanation, Bitcoin is fiat 'by decree' of the protocol definition, and transaction order is 'by decree' of hashpower.

@_date: 2014-03-15 03:32:52
I'm right with you.
Even though I hold some bitcoins, I'm more excited about the *idea* of bitcoin.  
I don't want bitcoin to fail, but it's failure is inevitable.  Don't get me wrong, for the next 5-10 years I think it'll do amazing things. If it truly takes off though, the wealth inequality (assuming it doesn't drastically change) will create enough incentive for it to fail.
We can't be for sure what exactly the wealth inequality in bitcoin is, [but one estimate]( puts Bitcoin's [GINI coefficient]( at 0.87709.  I don't think its that high, but I do think it's higher than [all the evil taxfarms]( you'll hear from the libertarian rhetoric around here.
It's not uncommon to see posts around here like "if only 1% of blah blah blah then zomg 1btc=$100000".  Questioning this logic will, most of the time, get you labeled as a hater.
But lets say 1btc=$100000. That would mean a market cap of 1.2 trillion dollars.
That would be 1/3 of the of [USD M0](  That would be huge.  And given the current wealth inequality, the "empire of Bitcoin" would become as unjust as the empires du jour.
Some around here might argue that because this inequality came about in a free market, it would be more just.  I don't buy this.
I'm not a communist.  I don't want perfect wealth equality. But I do think the level we have now is is too much.
Like bobalot, I too want my currency to be more socially democratic.  I think the blockchain can get us there.   Suppose you have a blockchain, and a reliable way to identify people (To prevent one person from creating multiple identities -- all socially democratic institutions have a method to do this).  You can now create an institution where *nobody can cheat the system* and everyone benefits *exactly as they should*
That's what really excites me about bitcoin.
Imagine: 'justcoin' where periodic re-distributions ensures the GINI coefficient never goes above 0.2
Imagine: 'mormoncoin' where 10% of every transaction goes to the church.
Imaging: 'medcoin' where 1 coin gets you a year of free healthcare.

This is a very good point, and the sort of thing we should be thinking about when answering the question "Is bitcoin ready for large, regular business transactions?"
Keep in mind though, if sold regularly over a week, even if the volume triples, other traders arbitraging with other exchanges could keep the price in check.
At some point the price will be affected (even global bitcoin volumes are tiny) but that's probably when you approach the volume of some of the larger exchanges.

So now we have a situation where anyone can be an arbitrator, acting without oversight, free to yell "j'accuse" to anyone they want, and that gives the rest of us carte blanch to steal these people's bitcoins.  Unless, [as you say here]( the coins have already left the original address, in which case the system is trivial to defeat...
Let's review:
1) Escrow is a better solution for most transactions.
2) Escrow is uneconomical for arbitrators of small transactions, but it's unclear how it would be economical for arbitrators of this system.
3) Escrow doesn't protect against fraudulent investment schemes, but neither does this solutions since even legit investment schemes will need to move the funds out if the inbound address to invest them, thereby making the coins untaintable.
@_date: 2012-10-27 16:23:24


Even if they gain nothing from it, I think the prevalence of internet trolls is overwhelming evidence that this must be guarded against.
And they could gain something out of it.. it opens up honest sellers to extortion.  "Send me another widget for free or I'm going to taint all your coins"


Sure but demanding escrow is far simpler that demanding "to send money for goods or services upfront only to an address that is already funded at greater than 1/w * the price of the good in untainted coins"

I plan to use bitcoin for transactions with people I don't know or trust, and ripple for transactions with people I know and trust (friends, co-workers etc.)  Heck, most of us use a primitive form of ripple today: "I'll buy this round, you get the next" or "I'll grab the cheque for this dinner, you get the next one".

Interesting analysis.  I have 2 comments.
1) You make the claim that ASICs have lowered the barrier to entry, since "Neophytes will no longer need to spend days exploring arcane configuration wizardry".  This assumes the greatest barrier to entry has been one of technical proficiency, rather than access to capital.  I believe the opposite is true.  If there were a lot of rich people just waiting for bitcoin mining to be easier before getting in on the game, why wouldn't they just spend their capital buying hardware and hiring the time of a "wizard" to configure it for them?
2) You claim that a proliferation of ASIC miners will produce "a downward tension" on the price of bitcoin as operators must cover their costs.  I agree with this.  Yet at the very end, you claim the price of BTC will rise.  I think I missed a step in the reasoning here.  Can you re-iterate why you think the price will rise?
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:26:16
Neither bitcoins nor dollars have inherent value.  What you've listed are nice properties of bitcoin, but do not represent inherent value.
Inherent value means if everybody suddenly stops accepting the currency, you can still do something useful with it.  
Something like rice has inherent value, because if nobody will accept it as a form a payment, at least you can still eat it.

Ok, ELY5:
Let's say you have a pizza.  People normally cut their pizza into 8 slices.  Sometimes you give your friend a slice of pizza and he gives you a soda.
Scenario 1) Big scary government makes lots of pizzas and starts dropping them from the sky.  Pizza is abundant.  Now all of a sudden you need to give your friend 2 slices of pizza (1/4 of a whole pizza) for a soda, or he'll give his soda to somebody else who will.
Scenario 2) Pizza is hard to come by, so hard in fact that people now decide to cut their pizzas into 16 slices instead of 8.  Because pizza is so yummy and hard to find, your friend is still willing to trade a slice of pizza (now 1/16 of a whole pizza) for a soda.
In Scenario 1, your pizza is worth less than it was originally.  You used to be able to get 8 sodas for a whole pizza, but now you can only get 4.
In Scenario 2, your pizza is worth more.  You can now get 16 sodas for a whole pizza.

Not at all, dude. The currency the bet is denominated in is everything.
Placing this bet in bitcoins is a way 'double down' on your bitcoin investment, sure.
But placing $100 *dollars* on that bet is silly.  As you say, if it pays out, you'd have $200 either way, but if it doesn't the bet always gives you $0 where bitcoins would still be valuable.
Similarly, betting 100 *bitcoins* that bitcoin will drop below $50 is a bad bet, because you might as well just sell the 100 bitcoins and use the cash to put a buy order in at %50.01.  If bitcoin does drop, you get 200 either way, but if it doesn't you still have the cash.

@_date: 2013-11-25 02:39:37
This is very good criticism that's not taken too seriously around here.  The counter arguments I've heard are:
1) The [network effect]( will keep out altcoin competition.  You don't see many facebooks/ebays do you?
What I think this argument misses is that classic examples of the network effect (telephone/facebook/etc) actively prevent integration with their system via strict control of the entry points or rent-seeking legislation.  Bitcoin is completely open, and once there exists at least one BTC/ALT exchange, altcoin holders can use all of the infrastructure built around Bitcoin and *nobody can stop them*.  
If a network effect exists, then it must exist for cryptocurrencies as a whole, and not specifically to Bitcoin.
Also, people who would argue that the network effect is what gives Bitcoin it's value are placed in the uncomfortable position of just having admitted that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme.
2) The altcoins offers no improvements over Bitcoin.
This is a much stronger argument, which is very much true today.  It'd be much harder to perform a 51% attack on Bitcoin compared to the alts.  The altcoins haven't been 'tested' to the extend bitcoin has.  When nasty bugs in the Bitcoin code have been discovered, they've been fixed within hours. 
But there is  one altcoin on the horizon that I'm aware of (zerocoin) that promises to offer significant advantages to Bitcoin.  What will happen when its released?  Who knows.
But even if you had the 'perfect' cryptocurrency, there would still be incentives to using altcoins: to maintain a reasonable distribution of wealth/power.
Every day on this reddit someone mentions how much a single bitcoin would be worth if 'only 1% of the worlds transactions were done in bitcoin'.  If that were to happen, think about how ridiculously wealthy the early adopters would be.  Alot of people who came to bitcoin in the early days did so due to their libertarian or anarchist ideals.  These people also tend to want to see an end the Empires that dominate the world. Do we really want to replace the current empires that rule with the empire of Bitcoin?
Satoshi taught us how to create a decentralized ledger.  Yes, that's a big deal and yes, it's revolutionary.  But there's no need to enrich the early adopters of Bitcoin indefinitely.  A future of multiple cryptocurrencies is an inevitability IMO.

[Intrade]( was a [prediction market]( that mysteriously shut down last month where people could buy and sell positions on future events.  Kind of like the [Hollywood Stock Exchange]( but with real money and for things other than movies.
For example, lets consider the statement "The US will declare war on North Korea before then end of 2013".  If you own a 'share' of this, it will pay a dollar if it turns out to be true, and nothing if it turns out to be false.  In the meantime you can buy and sell these shares on an open market.  Maybe I think this very likely (say, 80% chance) so buying shares for 70 cents is a good deal for me.  Maybe you work for the pentagon and think it's very unlikely (say, 10% chance) so selling shares to me for 70 is a great deal for you!
By tracking the price of these shares over time and given enough volume, we can get a robust estimate of the likelihood of future events.
Markets are great at aggregating information. And we can exploit this to do all sorts of cool stuff.  The coolest of which, in my opinion, is Robin Hanson theoretical political system called [futarchy]( where people "vote on values, but bet on beliefs".  Suppose we agree as a democracy we want to "improve medical care".  How should we do this?  Pundits and wonks will argue incessantly, and they can never be fully trusted because who knows who's interests they're really representing.  But we could use a prediction market to find out!  A sort of "put your money where your mouth is" which would make it very expensive for pundits to hold disingenuous positions.'
tl;dr prediction markets ftw!

I suppose it's possible, but I'd say unlikely considering Paypal spends a great deal on marketing and bitcoin has no marketing whatsoever.

So my question when this comes up is 'what's in it for the state?'
I can see why it might be good for the people, but what's in it for the decision makers?  Realistically, that's the only way it will get done.  Why would they choose bitcoin, where they have to pay up front and lose control over an important tool in there arsenal of power and control?  Keep in mind if they wanted to go crypto, they always have the option of forking the bitcoin source code, creating BannaRepulicCoin at virtually zero cost and potentially work in any additional controls they desire.
*If* this were to happen we should be looking at countries with extremely well functioning democracies, with a good incentive for the *people* to switch currencies.  Iceland seems a good fit.  They were rough on the banks during the crash, and were recently considering adopting the Canadian dollar.

You can do it for free using services that support a [green address](
Alice sends BTC to address A.  You create a wallet at a place like [instawallet]( and sent the BTC to address B (at instawallet).  You then withdraw the funds from instawallet to address C.  But the funds don't come from B, they come from D (instawallet's green address) which is not associated with B.

Whats the difference between one money and many monies if they're all digital currencies that can be exchanged automatically and on the fly, completely transparent to the user?  
Think of a bitpay like service that let's the both the buyer and seller choose their desired digital currency separately, and everything in between happens automatically for zero (or effectively zero) fees using P2P exchanges.  They both equally serve your definition of the function of money.
Eventually, there's going be a *strong* incentive for multiple cryptocurrencies.  To stop enriching bitcoin early adopters indefinitely (and I say this as an early adopter).  If bitcoin became the 'one world currency' we'd effectively be living under the empire of bitcoin.  Which is a pretty scary thought.

So you're saying why not just run the loop the other way?  Ie:
Sure if that opportunity exists, great.  and if you can go back and forth between this loop and the other one (with some reserves on both exchanges), you can postpone the transfer of USD.  But to arbitrage *indefinitely*, you have to close the loop eventually, agreed?
By "more arbitrage opportunities",  I mean that an arbitrage opportunity wont exist forever.  Someone will come along and take the free money.  The faster you can close the loop the more chances you'll have of taking the free money before someone else does.

Lets say there's 2 exchanges, with different buy/sell values.  You want to exploit this difference and make some money, so an example arbitrage loop might look like:
And you make a profit every time your money completes a cycle of the loop. 
BTC1-&gt;USD1: Sell BTC for USD on exchange 
USD1-&gt;USD2: Transfer USD from exchange  to exchange 
USD2-&gt;BTC2: Buy BTC using USD on exchange 
BTC2-&gt;BTC1: Bring your BTC back to exchange 
The slowest part of this process is USD1-&gt;USD2.  That could take weeks, and the arbitrage opportunity might be gone by that time.  In practice, people keep money on both exchanges, effectively skipping that step.  But during a large price change (like the one we're experiencing) you'll eventually need to transfer your funds, which is the limiting step.  If this step could be replaced by a step that's much faster, then there would be many more arbitrage opportunities.
You're right that gox doesn't deal in LTC.  And their prices are also much higher than other exchanges because of the huge USD withdrawal delays.

I'm going to explicitly number my assertions so that you can reference the one you disagree with (or find unclear)
1) In order to arbitrage indefinitely, you need to **fully close** the arbitrage loop.  An example of a fully closed loop is:
BTC1-&gt;BTC2-&gt;USD2-&gt;USD1-&gt;BTC1.  
Note that: 
Is not a loop and if this is all you are doing, it will result in missed arbitrage opportunities.  Missing opportunities means missing free money.
2) The faster you can close a loop, the more arbitrage opportunities you'll be able to exploit
3)  The loop:
Can be closed much faster than the loop
 
It also represents a new fully independent way of arbitraging BTC which can only result in more arbitrage opportunities (not less)
4) Because of 1-3, LTC allows more opportunities to arbitrage BTC. Therefore using LTC in your BTC arbitration strategy makes your arbitration strategy better.

[Green addresses]( could help here.
Before going to the furniture store, you transfer the BTC to an online wallet provider (like instawallet).  When you go to pay the merchant, you pay from this service which will transfer the BTC from a trusted address.

Editorializing and sensationalism aside, I hope we can agree on the following facts:
- Liberty Reserve was *accused* of laundering money.  Arrests were made, assets were seized.
- HSBC *admitted* to laundering money.  No arrests were made, no assets were seized.  A settlement was reached and HSBC promised they learned their lesson and wont do it again.
As hard as I try to find a consistent regulatory framework given these facts, I cannot.  What am I missing?

It's some added security, so that if someone brute forces your password, or installs a key-logger on your machine, your coins are still safe.
After logging into a site, the site will send you a text (or an email, but I think texts are more secure) with a random security code.  You must then enter this security code to log into the site.

Well, if you used one instawallet, then people could associate the 3 payments to the same person.
What would be cool is a service like instawallet where you could arbitrarily generate new sending addresses. I think the silk road does this.

There's very little volume on [MtGox-CNY]( and the spreads are huge.  No doubt people are arbitraging, but not that way.
But I agree with the Chinese demand driving up the price.  A large company *has* started accepting Bitcoin: Baidu (the "google of china") hence the Chinese demand.

Mining will always be a race to the bottom.  It was designed that way.  If a BTC was worth $100, there would be many more miners, the difficulty would adjust and the end result would be no more profitable than it is now.

The price has nearly doubled in the past month.  Do you seriously consider that steady, consistent growth?
To put it in perspective, pirateat40 was promising a 7%/week return.  That's 33%/month.  Therefore, to call the price increase of the past month consistent is even more outlandish that pirate's claim.

I completely agree with OP and think this is why the price of litecoin is rising recently.  When you think about it it's pretty brilliant: a hedge against the fall in BTC price that's completely automated, anonymous and has zero-counterparty risk. 
What an awesome way to stabilize a  single, or set of crypto currencies!
To all the litecoin haters: How can bitcoin be awesome and litecoin be bullshit?  They are the exact same thing!  
People peddling the "first mover" argument really are just hoping to get rich off of BTC.
I'm not buying the "network effect" argument either, because if you have the infrastructure for one cypto-currency, you certainly have it for *the exact same* crypto-currency.  This isn't facebook -- nobody has complete control to can shut you out like that.
Let's not hate on alt-chains, friends!.  Crypto-currencies are on the rise.  And a rising tide lifts all boats.

I could, but I'm not going to.  It's clear you're insta-replying to my posts without taking the time to think them through.


Maybe, but probably not.  If you wrote out all the loops an saw for yourself how fast and for what fees those loops could be closed, you'd realize that you'd also be arbitraging LTC at the same time.

I think we agree on alot of things.  I too, use and do business in bitcoin.  I too, do not use nor ever have used litecoin.  I too, think bitcoin will enjoy more success than litecoin.
As for merchant adoption, you might be a merchant that cares about bitcoins, but most merchants don't.  As you say, they don't care about Vietnamese dong in Delaware, they care about their local fiat.  That may be changing in certain parts of the world, and it may change everywhere eventually, but for now and the foreseeable future, over 99.9% of merchants care about their local fiat only.
Now if these 'normal' merchants are to accept bitcoin, they will likely only do so if they can immediately convert it to the fiat.  Indeed such services already exists and are enjoying success.  And once you have this infrastructure in place it's *trivial* to start accepting another crypto-currency should the need/want/use arise.  Worshiping at the altar of one-true-crypto currency (not that you're doing that, btw) is misguided.


This part sounds like the statement of someone who has something invested in seeing bitcoin succeed, rather than the neutral 3rd party stance being advocated.  Could a 3rd party observer say the same statement about people who push bitcoin?  Swapping the words litecoin---&gt;bitcoin and bitcoin---&gt;with say, apple stocks?

Does that include zerocoin?  
It's not an alt, yet.. So maybe you're not referring to it here, but I find zerocoin to be the most innovative thing since Satoshi's original paper.

These aren't newbs looking at cryptocurrencies for the first time and deciding to buy LTC over BTC.  I suspect this litecoin price jump is by people who own bitoin, who are selling them for litecoins.
It's a way to 'go short' on the price of bitcoin pseudonymously and with zero counterparty risk.  It happened in the last bubble too.
