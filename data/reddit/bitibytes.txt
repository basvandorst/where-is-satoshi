You can do that but I suggest that you never have the computer you created the wallet on ever touch the internet, I may be paranoid but I don't want any possible trace of my private keys (encrypted or not) to ever be on a computer that touches the internet.  
So DarkStarFTW's suggestion of properly deleting your wallet file before going online is a 2nd best, I just don't trust myself to properly delete something and also I don't trust my computer to be free of malware that could already have stolen my private keys and is just waiting to be attached tot he internet to send them  to somebody.  
Remember, just because your crypto wallet doesn't appear to be compromised yet doesn't mean their isn't somebody waiting for you to make a big deposit before they utilize the private key they stole.  So our job it to make sure our crypto wallet private keys are never in a situation where they could be compromised, not even for a moment.  Again I'm paranoid about this but I don't think theirs any way to feel confident your private key isn't compromised unless you create the wallet on an offline computer and never connect it to the internet, or use a hardware wallet like a ledge nano or Trezor.  
Full disclosure, I don't in fact have a whole computer I keep offline, I have a hard drive that I installed an OS on and I connect that hard drive to a computer and boot from it when I want to access my offline wallet to sign transactions on, I load the transactions off of a USB stick, the transactions I created and saved on my watching wallet (the one that is online), I don't connect to the internet while that hard drive is booted from, I disconnect the network plug and remove the wireless adapter.  I really really try to protect my private keys, for some reason I don't trust myself with a ledger nano or Trezor, never used them, maybe I'll give them a try soon.

Did you sell your Bcash and Bgold or do you still hold that too?  I noticed you only list Bitcoin, have you not invested in any other alt coins?  Thank you in advance!

Security note with Electrum, setup encryption/pw on your wallet when you set it up.  Eectrum is great but I highly recommend that you setup your initial wallet on an old computer/notebook that you can reserve for being an offline (never connected to the internet, perferably a clean install too, but totally offline) computer, never store your private keys or mnemonic on an internet connected computer/ better yet only store the mnenomic on multiple pieces of paper away from cameras and not labeled as 'my Bitcoin private key' as that will tip people off pretty quick.  You can setup your Electrum wallet on this offline computer and then on your internet connected computers only setup a 'watching' wallet.  
This would work nicely for you because you only are using it for storage and not spending BTC so manually signing your transactions on the offline computer and saving them to a USB stick to then open on your internet connected computer and then broadcast to the network would not become a hindrance.  You'll just be sending BTC to an address in your wallet (a segwit address!) and you can using your 'watching only' wallet on your internet connected computer to verify your balance or for that matter you can just use blockchain.info to watch your wallet too.  
Another tip, don't do what I did and spread your BTC across multiple addresses, it seemed like a good idea at the time but when you do go about and sent that BTC somewhere it will cost more for TX fees to send from multiple 'inputs/addresses' as it makes your transaction size much larger.

Read up on it last week, 10 Million and up is multi-millionaire status, below 10 million is millionaire.

As I understand it, it will be a fee market, if you decide to run a large node with the lower or same fees as the node ran by the other organizations, then yes I don't see why your node wouldn't also be used similarly, there may be other factors that make a node a preferred hop in the route from origin to destination other than fees and node size though.  Anybody have more clarity to provide?

Can anyone identify the transaction on the blockchain?  We have an approx. date, would be neat to actually see it within a block explorer.

Read the FAQ here linked off this LN testnet map, it says it will be like running a node.

I second the request for proof, how are we suppose to know your legit?
Edit: I read in the sidebar that donation requests are allowed for large recognized charities, is this one of those?  IDK

Because the price at 1200 had speculation of an approval of the ETF baked into the price, the price of a traded commodity includes both fundamentals (assumed facts) and also speculation on the future, when the speculation gets confirmed to now be a fact, in this case the speculation of an approval of the ETF today turns into a fact that its not approved today then the market readjusts with this new information taken into account, it also takes time for new information to be digested by the market as new interpretations of the future get circulated around.

I signed up, I love signing up for free courses, I just have never finished one.  I suppose that makes me like the majority of registrants.  : (
