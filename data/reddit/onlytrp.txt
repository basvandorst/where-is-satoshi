 BCH didnt exist back then thats why its different, BCH is a serious threat cus if people not as confident as the people in this community just decide to say fuck it and stop hodling they can easily just dump BTC and pump BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:55:56
I'll miss the floor :( I have to go to sleep , o well , hopefully when I wake up it's at 3500 or 3400.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:32:30
How much more can they pump BCC?
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:33:01
Is bitcoin hitting 3k this weekend? trying to buy 1btc while its cheap
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:03:28
Yeah, is now a good time?
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:58:29
So from 4000 to 4190 is a risk if buy?
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:17:50
This is what I want to know ...
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:22:07
Lmao @ "dead cat bounce" , I'll wait a lil . Not sure what the hell im looking for though , I'm a newb ��.
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:13:30
Care to explain why ? o: I think i missed the floor at 3700 its at 3800 :/.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:05:23
The market changes all the time.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:05:22
But I want to jump in not out what do you mean after the bounce get out ? �� (sorry , very newb)
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:54:01
I woulda had like 0.88 btc , so it woulda been like buying bitcoin at around 6k, not bad, 10k profit.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:37:45
Not sure if really dumb or just a really good troll.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:22:33
Cool, any good YouTube channel that you know of on trading ? I'll look into crytotrader and cryptomarkets subreddit I guess .
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:24:47
Lmao , aren't they hurting it though ? Credibility people are gonna get tired of this shit? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:29:29
what price did you buy at?
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:12:53
Newbie here trying to learn the art of trading , mind me asking what tools do I need to know when it hits the bottom and is ready to bounc ?
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:15:39
Fuck, I want to learn this stuff , did you go to school for this or what books did you read? , it's already getting close to 4K again lol 
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:50:40
Thanks man , I will look into that ! I'm watching some analysis and tutorials on trading, I'll learn the basics and go from there. 
It's at 3740! Did it break the resistance you were talking about ? Is it hitting the 3600s ? I guess we can't tell yet .. This is sortve exciting tho, that is until I put my money in probably , then I'll rip my hair off every time I lose 5% ��.
Edit ; it's at 3662 at coinbase! I gotta go to sleep I'm gonna miss the floor aren't I?
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:57:01
It doesn't seem to move that much , do you think it will fall more after monday or what ?
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:57:59
Is now a good time ?

how much bitcoin will I have if it goes like that (unrealistic pattern lol)
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:57:19
Im getting more excited than last night when I was watching the leaked episode of GoT and I dont even own much btc or bch yet (10mBTC and 10 mBCH).
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:38:01
Newbie here , I guess buy if it starts going up again? Anyone else holding on the trigger share where you'll buy ?
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:52:27
Cool , I wanna buy 1 BTC , I will buy 1k at 3500 and then see if it keeps dipping I think .
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:37:31
fuuck, all your money? just left out some fiat money for rent and food or what?
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:38:17
It can go up too, FOMO will drive ppl to buy in expectation of a bull run. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:18:06
Link to source?
Edit : I found this 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:36:46
I imagine that if big boys wanted they could kill bitcoin with a few moves of their mouse and phone (billions style lmao)
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:45:31
Ive been holding the trigge steady and don't know if I should pull the trigge right now at 4K not looking to buy that much , prolly 1k , what do you think ? With the current information that we have can it dip more than 4K? I know you shouldn't ever try to catch a falling knife but I'm tempted to just buy . 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:01:11
Ohh , I want to jump in the ship ��  (prolly just 1btc for now ) u think it will keep dipping or nah? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:08:57
I wanted to do the same weeks ago but didn't, I haven't slept in days since the bull run cus right now I dont know if I should all in or wait for a dip. I want it to correct itself to 3800- 4000 so I can buy 2k and then DCA every week
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:59:15
I see, so if I say wanted to buy 1 whole bitcoin what would I need to buy to reduce my risk of getting burned right now?
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:07:35
Just woke up to go to the restroom it's at 3800 fffffff, nother bull run?
Edit : I'm buyin lol
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:08:33
Shieeeet m8, was gonna go meet someone from localbitcoins and buy $1000 in btc now I dont know what to do with my life.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:39:56
Makes sense , crypto markets are not at stock level yet , thy need to "mature"
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:41:10
How can you tell when the drop ends, care to share ? I'm holding on the trigger too , wanna drop 2k on some btc.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:02:01
Yup 1080p with good sound , it was aired by accident by someone at HBO . Got it from here  not sure if it's still up 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:04:50
How much more bro?
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:05:01
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:03:35
This time is different though, shit got real, shit may hit the fan.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:10:53
Cool! I watched the show billions but they don't get too technical with their strategies ,  all I know is short means that some big fish is selling all their stock , im assuming bounce is when it's no longer being shorted and instead being pumped ? But how do I know when it's bouncing ?
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:57:07
What do you mean ?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:07:03
Could it stick tho? Not all btc hodlers can withstand so many deaths of btc and confidence in the coin may be gone, this time theres another coin that they can go dump all their load on, this is kinda scary , no?
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:24:15
See it's going up , FOMO , my friend just called me and told me he's buying some too lol .
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:53:08
Why do you own more bitcoin if you think this way? What does it take for a coin like dash to take over bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:47:38
Holy shit, is BCH hitting BTC prices ? I'm having mixed feelings now, was gonna buy 1btc but I might just get some BCH too.
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:39:15
I predict an increase of 150 - 300 then a decrease of 100 then that will be the floor or somethin.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:07:35


@_date: 2017-08-24 04:10:29
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:57:26
I think both of you guys are right , this shit is really interesting , I'm gonna go binge watch trading tutorials 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:02:22
They didn't have any stuck transactions ?
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:18:41
1% per day? Can you explain your strategy?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:19:29
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:53:47

what does massive short squeeze mean?
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:38:13
Nice , well I'm the real noob here , you know way more than me. What price do u think btc will be at right before the split ?
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:09:53
Explain fixed schedule
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:21:58
Yeah they're saying bitcoin will split into 2 coins in august, and only one of them will be worth keeping.
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:44:40
It's at 2500 rn, Buy now or wait for it to dip a little more ?
