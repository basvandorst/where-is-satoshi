Many other coins offer instant transactions with low fees already, it doesnt seem to be a game changer for them, why do you think it is for Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is expected to split in another chain again, so there will be 3 Bitcoins then... this only makes more and more confusing for people... because you are triplicating the coins out there, you are creating money from the thin air...

I just wanna remind you that a short squeeze requires buying pressure and very little offer/thin ask side. 
If there is no demand and the price keeps going lower, the offer will keep growing. 
With China out of the game, a big chunk of the world demand for bitcoins will be gone making short squeezes less and less likely the closer we get to the date chinese exchanges close.

If you are realistic...
Guns wins against best MMA fighter in the world.
Skilled sword fighters too.
Another example is... David vs Goliath... the one with the weapon... was David who was smarter (represented by the chinese).
If your intention was to defend Bitcoin, you are doing it in the wrong way.

It means that next two weeks the price for all cryptos will rocket launch.

That's what bitcoiners say to lure money into Bitcoin.
Another argument is that Bitcoin will hit $300k, however, latelly that number has been increased to $1 million.

I'd rather have Bieber's life than all the bitcoins in the world. 
He has million of girls, fame, money. 
What do rich bitcoiners have? Only money. 
They can pay for girls right, but... I was told that groupies are the best at bed...

That's right, but those algos cant outplay HODLers.

If it goes to 10 cents, then it won't ever go back to $1000. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:57:21
If that's true, it's worse than a ban. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:54:44
If the probability of dropping to $3500 is higher than the probability that the price will recover. You should definitelly NOT HODL.
It's common sense.

You didn't buy more and you know it.

Bitcoin: 6283 users online out of 305,996 total users.
r/aww: 15613 users online out of 15,926,815 total users.
Only speculators spend so much time looking for information on internet about their investments.
Bitcoin is full of speculators, but very few users. That's a huge red flag.

The more Bitcoin is distributed, the more the weak hands holding bitcoins, the more the likelihood of the big crash.
Tulips price crashed when everybody in Holland was planting it.

China won't allow any foreign controlled technology (specially one made by a guy with a japanese nickname) to influence their country. You can see this watching what they did to Facebook and Google, they banned them so their own companies (Renren and Baidu) can take the market. 
It's happening the same thing with Bitcoin, they are banning it and making their own state-controlled cryptocurrency.

That's what I did, and then I opened a short.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:45:19
1 million. 
At current market cap is already more expensive than Paypal. 
Tell me, are bitcoins more used than Paypal? for any other purpose other than speculations?
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:42:03
He is not talking in terms of market cap, he is obviously going short.

Next time sell it all and open a short position.
You are not late yet for the short though.
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:15:37
Equal number of people? So if 100 people sell 100 bitcoins, another 100 people has to buy it?
The thing is that if 1 guy holding 100 bitcoins , lets say for $5000 sell it to 100 people, the bitcoin is more distributed and when price drops, some of those 100 people will sell, however, if the seller of 100 bitcoins is someone who bought at $200, it's more likely that he doesn't care too much if the price drops 50% and will hold.
You can´t say the same thing about the new 100 buyers who bought at $5000.

So are you going to punch Vitalik's face? :(
He looks like a nice guy.

I don't think this is positive for bitcoin at all. We are getting too much attention and things like this play against the interest of authorities and can provoke a regulation or a ban of the Bitcoin. I think its better for Bitcoin to mantain a low profile until we are too big too fall.
