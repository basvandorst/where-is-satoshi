For future reference, make a transaction or a set of transactions that have relative locktime of a week later that spends the majority of your funds. Sign using the privkeys of the inputs. Throw away those keys.
When you wanna use one of the lumps you broadcast one of the transactions you made, wait a week, then send it to the place you intended to, with eventual change going to a new set which you “lock up” in the same fashion. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:03:10
It’s basically a time lock where you can’t move the funds until you wait a week. That way even if someone put a gun in your face you couldn’t send it to them no matter what. The caveat is that you throw away those privkeys so you can never change the timelock transaction.

A miner mines a new block. The time to transfer that to the miner the farthest away takes about 12s right now, iirc. That’s 12 seconds of lost mining time, or 12/600th of the time until the next block (on average) is mined, that this miner is spending on trying to find a block that was already mined. Miners close to the miner gains a slight advantage and there’s also a problem with orphan rates where the longer the propagation time is the higher the rate of orphans. 
The bigger each block is, the greater the remote miners’ disadvantage becomes. This very quickly results in more and more centralization around a specific “dense” area of miners and fringe miners are gradually phased out because it simply becomes unprofitable to try to keep up with the big guys.
I believe the current absolute max size is 4 mb which happens to be the maximum theoretical size of a segwit block.

You can send it back using RBF if you opted into it. The destination doesn’t have to be the same.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:00:06
Experiments indicate that 4 mb is the max before it becomes a problem. They didn’t pick the segwit 4 mb cap randomly.

No nodes means nobody except miners are validating. Miners can then gather 50+% of their fellows and decide to give out 1000 btc at every block. You wouldn’t know cause you don’t validate. All economic activity would be over SPV and they wouldn’t know either. Exchanges merchants users would all blindly trust the miners to “do the right thing”. Which they wouldn’t.

Don’t use btc until you understand how it works. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:34:52
Addresses are not really related to this. Say you send 1 btc. 
You have 100 utxos all with 0.01 btc in them. 
You spend and sign those to get your 1 btc. 
This means your transaction has 100 inputs with signatures.  And one output. 
I do the same but I have a single 10 btc utxo. 
I spend only that and send 1 btc and send 9 btc back to myself. 
My transaction has 1 input and 2 outputs.  
Thus it is smaller.

I definitely think it’s contradictory to support a dangerous HF because they want more tx throughput and then not implement support for a safe upgrade that gives them what they want. 
That segwit has other beneficial elements seems unrelated to the topic.

1. Fiat is a scam. 
2. Bitcoin has by far the superior team of devs behind it. Other crypto currencies frequently hard fork or are hacked some way or other while bitcoin just takes the scientific peer reviewed approach. 
This is also why I am not afraid of bcash suddenly “flipping” and becoming known as the real btc. It has no competence to back it so it’s going to either stagnate, transform into a completely centralized thing, or introduce horrible security holes that result in bcash crash to zero.

@_date: 2017-12-14 07:38:19
USD value is irrelevant only transaction size (in bytes) and fee rate (fee divided by transaction size) matters. 
Example: your transaction is 100 bytes. You pay 1000 satoshi. 
1000/100=10 satoshi/byte. 
My transaction is 50 bytes and I pay 550 satoshi. 
550/50=11 satoshi/byte. 
Miners will pick mine before yours.

1. We need to deploy and find out the capacity of the second layer solutions we have available like LN.
2. We need to finish hard fork research to make HFs safe and non-contentious on the engineering level. Lots of unanswered questions here. It may be necessary to implement RP in bitcoin before we hard fork.
3. We need broad community consensus.
4. We need to time the HF sufficiently far in the future (years) that every vested interest party can have time to think over and argue for/against the goal.
5. We need to have the implementation details in place long before this date. I foresee something like code completion 3-5 years before the fork happens.
6. We need all of this to be discussed and decided on in the public, and we need to enforce strict peer review process to ensure no one party makes decisions that go against the better of the entire community.
If all of the above was the case, I think a lot of people would be behind a blocksize increase. 
Added bonus points if we also cut some tech debt due to old bugs and similar in the process but some might say that’s too ambitious.
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:05:07
You’re confused. The end of mining doesn’t exist. Fees are meant to replace the subsidy when it diminishes. 
You’re also confused about time frames. The subsidy will drop more drastically than you seem to think. The last 50 or so years will go from ~600 satoshi to 0. 
Regarding Proof of Stake: it seems interesting but so far it appears to be flawed in numerous ways. Still hoping for a worthwhile replacement personally.

Yes you are, in theory, able to peg-out the coins on both sides of the fork. 
You may need the peg-out mechanism to support doing so, however (eg if one or both sides have replay protection), and you may risk losing funds if you peg out prematurely. 
It’s all theory though. I don’t think anyone’s put any serious thought into this.
Pegging in will most likely only work from one chain though which means the sidechain would have to start tracking both sides or you wouldn’t be able to track which coins were split and which weren’t.  Perhaps the sidwchain itself needs to be forked when the main chain forks. Sounds messy.

Selling will only be useful if the price keeps dropping. Can you say that it will? No. Can anyone say it’ll go back up? No. But it has in the past. So people suggest just riding it out.

Coinbase are very much proponents of Segwit2x. As such they may change their opinion on a whim on how they will deal with the fork. They may see that lots of miners are on Segwit2x in the beginning. It may go up in price. They may see this as a victory sign and simply drop the btc support. 
It is likely that a lot of pro b2x whales like Roger Ver will prop up b2x and try to push down btc to make this exact thing happen. They can do this for awhile but not forever.
If that sounds sorta risky to you you should probably move your coins somewhere less volatile.

If they don't they can lie to people saying their chain is bitcoin cause it has all the traffic. 
They can do that even if only 0.0000001% of the users are using their chain cause they can just copy paste the other chunk into their chain.
You CAN split your coins though. You send to one address on one side and to another address on the other. 
To do this you need to use a feature called lock time and make use of the fact one chain moves more slowly than the other. I can explain details if you haven't seen it described yet. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 02:14:45
Worst case bitcoin core implements replay protection in bitcoin. It may me time since we're seeing more and more forks. 
Otherwise there are things you can do without changing the chain. Benevolent miners could make a bunch of anyone can spend 0 value utxos. People could then use those in their transactions. That would prevent the transaction from being relayed on the other chain. 
You could also manually split your coins. It is not foolproof but basically you would take advantage of the fact s2x has more volume and will take lower fee transactions faster. You put a minimum fee transaction in s2x. As soon as it's in a block you replace-by-fee but change the destination to a different address. The new tx would not be able to go into the s2x chain cause they already have it in a block while the bitcoin side would replace it with the new one cause the fees are higher so you would split your coins. 
This could fail e.g. if the bitcoin chain mined your transaction before you relayed the new one but that's no big deal since you are just sending to yourself on both sides. Just try again until you succeed. Minimal fees are minimal. 
You could buy a small amount on one side. It would most likely not be replayable on the other side (if it was you should probably replay it as it is free money). You then include that utxo in a new transaction to yourself. That has privacy implications since the seller may have knowledge of who you are and by combining the two you are binding the old utxo to your identity.

Segwit fixes malleability. It makes transaction ids known before they're signed which makes a lot of future tech possible like lightning. 
It does give a small incentive to spending outputs compared to making them which discourages spamming new utxos as this effectively becomes more expensive. This is what people refer to when they say it's cheaper. It's not, really. It was never meant to be either. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:15:22
Last one I see is august 9, not really three months but not as often as I thought either. With s2x there is no telling how much orphaning will go on. Perhaps if everyone holds their txs and wait due to uncertainty it'll be as often as now (with full 8mb blocks I expect lots more orphans but no one knows).
I don't think I'm over egging anything but we'll have to wait and see. I hope you're right. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:52:20
I think the average person is accepting of the idea at some point in the future if everyone is behind it and it's done in a responsible manner.  Not everyone. Some people will probably never leave the original chain even if everyone else transfers over.

Of course it makes sense. When the subsidy is &lt; 1 btc and blocks are so big there's no incentive to pay anything other than the minimum fee the miners are going to say they are not being paid enough to continue mining and they will require a subsidy change to pay out X btc forever. For us to not just say "huh? Stop mining then" they need to impress on the minds of everyone that they, the miners, decide the future of bitcoin. 
Unfortunately (for them) the core devs (and many on this sub) are openly and loudly calling them out on their bullshit but they're becoming more sophisticated with time. S2x will be followed by a different "project" just like BU and the others.
If you take a closer look the entire idea falls apart. S2x is absolutely not needed right now. It may make sense in a year once LN etc ha shown us what it can do but now? It's horrendously poor timing. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:44:44
BCH was probably an experiment to test how a hard fork would work out. It turned out well enough to be confident about the new one coming around the corner (s2x) which will attempt to actually take over bitcoin. Stay tuned. Exciting times. 
Sorry I didn't really answer your question. It's basically just a spinoff without segwit and a big block size and last I heard no one is using it. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:43:19
They will be auto replayed on the 2x chain. You may be able to do low fee rbf opt-in on b2x chain immediately (upon confirmation) followed by a rbf up on btc side to send the coins to a separate addy but it'll be error prone and not easy for boobs. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:47:04
Yes it would because the probability that the remaining miners lose the mining race (spend ten minutes trying to find a block only to have someone else announce one before they get it) will drop. After difficulty adjustment it will eventually neutralize to the hash rate of the remaining miners.
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:50:06
The transaction yes. In other words the person who spent bitcoins gets them back and the person who received bitcoins loses them. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 10:59:52
- with replay protection users can choose one or the other. They do not risk a tx meant for one chain to appear on the other one
- without replay protection users have no say on the matter. The new chain will essentially "steal" your transactions and shove them into their chain.
That effectively means that even if no one cares about the new chain it will still give the illusion of being in use by a bunch of people. This is entirely what they are aiming for. They named their new client "btc1" and are releasing their code with the same version as bitcoin except with 1.15 instead of 0.15 so new people will think the btc1 version is "newer".
Eventually if enough people buy into it they will take over the network. 
Compare this to having replay protection where the two chains are different starting at the first forked block and transactions on one side cannot be relayed on the other. 
Hopefully that explains why replay protection is essential. And why s2x is a takeover attempt. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:22:29
Sorry I thought you were talking about BCH not LN. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:57:42
Why does it become much easier? The change makes the difficulty adjust more rapidly but it adjusts it proportionately. You would essentially get roughly the same difficulty except it would be smooth rather than once every two weeks. Can you explain the attack more in detail?

I don't think you understand what I mean by reorg. I'm simply talking about the case where a block is orphaned. You verify a tx you made went into a block then rbf it. Afterwards a different block appears without your tx and you have to retry. This happens often. With s2x no one knows how this will play out. Ie it's not trivial. 
By WILL I mean that lots of people will think "another bcash" and send coins and be robbed of bitcoin. Only a matter of extent not if.

Not a BIP but a starting point. 
This is a hard fork. Under normal circumstances it would be unacceptable by most people but if timed with the s2x fork it would give miners an alternative way out in the worst case. The key point lies in the fact we won't know how many miners stay on bitcoin and how many switch over. Signaling tells nothing of what miners ultimately end up doing. 
This is a hard fork that is more complex and with less review time than s2x ever had. Again, this may be deemed acceptable as we expect a split already and it may be the only way to keep the bitcoin chain moving in the case of too little hashpower. 
Three chains would temporarily exist:
- bitcoin
- bitcoin with smooth retargeting (proposed)
- s2x
Two scenarios:
- s2x receives minority hashpower and fails on fork
- btc received minority hashpower and stops: miners may choose to switch to the smooth retargeting chain at this point or they may choose to continue mining the pure chain
Ideally the latter scenario should be opt in. Perhaps if the target nBits could be allowed to be intentionally higher it would be considered the same chain until a miner activates the faster adjustment. 
Feedback welcome.

With replay protection:
- Bert gives Lisa a cookie
- Lisa can take Bert's chocolate bar if she wants
- In fact, Barry will take the chocolate bar from Bert and shove it into Lisa's hands
- Bert can give himself a cookie
- Barry will also take a chocolate bar from Bert and shove it into his hands. No biggie but weird, Barry. 
Without replay protection: none of the above. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:05:33
No. Since the history of both chains is shaped up until the point it is forked any coins you transfer can be potentially transferred on the other chain too.
Basically if you have coins that are on both chains and you send them on one someone can copy that over to the other side. 
Edit: you would not have this problem if you bought after the fork. So yeah a new wallet that is empty wouldn't have this problem.

Something is wrong with your setup. Are you firewalling p2p traffic? Outgoing is usually allowed but in stricter environments sometimes people prefer to explicitly allow even outgoing.

A transaction is basically an order to move bitcoins. 
If you send bitcoin to Bob he can just put your transaction on the other chain and get both kinds. You meant to only send him bitcoin but you ended up also giving him Segwit2x coins. 
To stop this you have to somehow get your coins into different places on each chain. This is called splitting your coins.

It could be confusing to less versed users. 2XC would at least show the 2X part which might ring more bells. I like both tho.

It would not make existing transactions unusable. Everything would work as before except new transactions would only be valid on one side. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:11:52
You can use an exchange and set up limit orders. 
For example "buy X bitcoin if price ever goes below $Y".
You will lock up the amount though and it only happens once per order. 
You can also do the reverse but that also locks up the btc you wanna sell.

They have already tested the waters with BCH (yeah despite all the attention that's all it was, an experiment) and they were very successful despite it all. They're confident they can take over bitcoin and seeing posts like this makes me think they have a good shot at it to be honest. Let's sit back and watch it fucking explode in our faces and then pat each other's backs when it's all over. Yeah except there's going to come a time when these assfucks manage to get enough momentum to swing the pendulum once and for all and then we're all sitting there like the little assfucks we are wondering how the incompetent assfucks managed to get the better of us.

Source? First I heard of this. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 06:46:30
It's not 1 MB it's 4 MB. Current bitcoin can do up to 4 MB blocks with segwit. 
It's been tested how big a block can be before it starts causing so much latency when being transmitted across the network that it causes miner power to "diverge" on one spot (centralized to one single hot spot).  That limit was 4 MB.

@_date: 2017-09-13 00:48:04
Basically it'll be piggyback riding on bitcoin in terms of chain but it'll have its own version of it so you'll have different blocks with different transactions in them but ultimately the history will look roughly the same. This assumes the 2x nodes establish bridges between the two nets shuffling mempool transactions back and forth between them and there will be a lot of double spending going on so it'll be a bit of a mess to wade through. 
You will be able to buy and receive as normal assuming you ensure the payment is valid on the bitcoin chain. You may want to push the transaction to the 2x chain nodes so you receive on both ends but nothing prevents the sender from pushing a different transaction spending the same outputs on the 2x chain to prevent you from doing this. 
Once double spending has been going on for awhile the chains will gradually drift apart. Especially since newly mined coins will only be on one or the other chain. Over time the two chains will probably have diverged so much they are essentially different. 
That all assumes 2x is long lived which is highly doubtful. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:58:36
Yeah this. Get a ledger nano s or trezor and move your coins to it. Just make sure you keep the seed and keep it safe. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:18:24
Bigger blocks would also increase centralization as hubs of dense hashpower would have a clear advantage over others due to block propagation times. In particular miners in places with subpar connections.
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:27:09
The mechanism is called replay protection and as you see they are not bothering to implement it. Because they want this exact ability. They can pretend they have all the users even if they have no users by simply copying btc transactions over automatically. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:20:56
Strictly speaking B needs the first transaction to exist before they can spend the btc they received from it. 
Doesn't have to be mined though as long as it's in the mempool.

It's very simple. Some people want to hard fork. Others do not. The general idea is, we only hard fork if everyone is ok with it. Or at least the majority.
I'm saying "we" here, as the new fork will not protect the old one in any way which makes it hostile.  Edit: if it was a fork away from bitcoin like bcash it would be different hence "we".
Are you with me so far?
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:11:59
You'd have to wait quite a long time even with the new retargeting. As I said it is proportional to time. You would be able to make blocks with lower difficulty by waiting less time but I don't think it would be bad enough to be considered an attack vector. Math would help here. I only have my phone right now but I'll test your idea on Monday.

You wait for the block heights to be different and then use lock time to send the coins to two different places on the two chains. 
If you send forked one to the exchange you will end up sending your bitcoin to the exchange as well. If it is coinbase they will ignore (steal) your bitcoin because they think Segwit2x is the new bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:52:34
Two issues with this approach:
1. If you don't use replay protection you may end up having the transfer on b2x chain as well putting you back at square 1 minus paid fees. 
2. Unless you do this several times you link all your utxos together which eliminates a lot of privacy.

@_date: 2017-09-28 01:31:43


Yeah about that.
You sat down in a room. You made a decision. You acted on it. Perhaps against your better judgment on occasion. Promises were made.
But you forgot the most important part about the very thing whose future you decided to dictate. Bitcoin doesn't work like that. It doesn't let you sit down in a room with suits and change its future. It was built to avoid that kind of thing from the ground up. 
I think we could forgive you for the misconception. Really, it's a new world and new tech and we all kind of lose sight of the end goals at times.
But you just won't stop pushing this thing despite the community showing it's clearly not in unanimous agreement and the clear lack of developer support and despite the clear lack of competent people working on btc1. 
Mempool is not full. I send transactions for a few cents that confirm within ten-twenty minutes. Lightning and other tech is coming to boost scaling to unseen levels. Your fork is just flat out a really horribly bad idea. It may be the exact thing to do a few years down the road when we exhaust LN capacity but until then it's simply ridiculous to split the network. 
We could forgive you but the fact is you're in some really bad company. 
Btc1 is named so that new people think it's the main bitcoin. Its versions are named after bitcoin but with a 1 instead so new people will see "bitcoin-1.14" (btc1) and "bitcoin-0.15" (bitcoin) and think, incorrectly, that the former is newer and thus better. 
BitPay announces that "to upgrade to segwit install btc1". It's a flat out lie and deception. 
There's a lot more. If you wonder why people label you a villain you may wanna take an inward look and reevaluate your circle of friends. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:08:36

@_date: 2017-09-21 11:29:14
Lots of people think segwit is a way to increase the transaction throughput.  It is but that's just an afterthought of the actual problem it solves, namely malleability. Without a malleability fix you can't know beforehand what a transaction id is which prevents you from doing a lot of cool stuff like lightning and other things. Those will scale bitcoin. Segwit is just a fix for them. 
Segwit2x is a corporate decided agreement to enable segwit in exchange for raising the block size to 2 mb. Note that the two (segwit and 2 mb hard fork) are completely unrelated. This is purely narrative. We now have a lot of confused people who somehow thinks segwit IS segwit2x when in reality the two are completely unrelated.
The big controversy lies in that segwit2x devs refuse to include replay protection which turns their hard fork into an attack on the existing bitcoin network: even if no one cares about their new chain they can put up an illusion that people do by relaying real bitcoin transactions on their chain. If this goes on long enough people will be utterly confused and may think the 2x chain is the real bitcoin when in fact it isn't. 
There's also a lot of exasperation because this hard fork is coming right as new tech is being made available that will improve the scaling issues tremendously. If they were honestly concerned about the scalability they would wait until they saw how things panned out but they aren't waiting. 
Their hard fork is also very dangerous. It will result in up to 8 mb blocks because segwit supports up to 4 mb already. It has only been proven that up to 4 mb is okay but anything beyond that has implications in terms of latency and centralization (not ELI5 material).
Besides, if you look at the mempool lately you will realize that it's far from full. It is filled up occasionally but most indicates this is spam to convince people it's full rather than actual real transactions. 
Tl;dr: segwit enables cool shit. s2x is a takeover attempt. Replay protection is not in there because it is a takeover attempt. This is controversial cuz ppl don't want bitcoin to be taken over by a bunch of corporations.

You'd be surprised at how much a voice can mean in the greater scheme of things. Just keep you and yours in the know and respond when you see deception and maybe we'll get out of this one in one piece. Complacency is not an option until exchanges and businesses take a stand. Once they do they will put pressure on their own and hopefully stop this from causing serious economic damage.

It feels like a big gamble when you sell and expect a dip that never happens and lose.

The seed is based on a standard that is supported by multiple software projects out there so even if ledger imploded you'd still have your bitcoin. 
As for the rest, yes they could but it would be at the risk of losing everything they've worked for since no one would ever buy or use their products again. And they're public with a public company so its not like they can just sneakily steal everyone's bitcoin and walk free.

No altcoin discussions here. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:11:26
Basically you wait for the two chains to have different heights. 
Say bitcoin is at 500000 and s2x is at 500010.
You create a transaction sending to yourself that requires the block height to be at least 500010. You do this using lock time. Your new transaction will be invalid on the bitcoin network until it has mined 10 more blocks but it's already valid in Segwit2x. You put it in the Segwit2x network and wait for it to be mined. 
Once it's been mined and confirmed you create a different transaction, also sending to yourself but to a new (different) address. You don't put any lock time stuff in but you may want to have a higher than average fee or you may end up with the other transaction being mined. 
Anyway this new transaction is valid on bitcoin but invalid on Segwit2x because it would be a double spend. You get it into the bitcoin chain and you're all set. Split complete. Yay!
If you screw up or wait too long and the same transaction ends up in both chains you just try again until you succeed. Since you're sending to yourself the worst thing that happens is that you get both coins back into the same address. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:18:46
Don't make this sound like a choice thing. If they wanted to fork off and make their choice they would do it in a less deceptive and more choice friendly way (ie with replay protection and not calling it bitcoin when it's not).
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:56:09
They can be in the same block. As long as B knows about the transaction they can spend it. It's risky though cause A could double spend it which would undo B's transaction. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:38:57

Core is a big hindrance to bitmains and Ver's plans. 
For example it is abundantly clear that the miners do not believe fees will cover their expenses in the future. Otherwise they would long ago conclude that fees need a market to remain profitable. As such there is a window of opportunity to steal the narrative and convince the world that the miners control bitcoin. If they are able to do this they can then change the subsidy to stop halving at a certain point e.g. at 5 btc.
It's exceedingly obvious that miners and users are on opposite sides. The former wants to maximize their profits even at the cost of the latter. The latter wants the same. 
The devs happen to be siding with the users (they could just as well have been a group of hardcore miners). 
So no. The miners would love if core devs vanished. They'd get shitty software but it would be all under their control. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:29:36
You don't have to do anything to keep your coins on both sides. 
Just don't use them until the situation stabilizes. Once it does there should be information on how to split if the NYA chain even exists at that point. 
tl;dr: don't send bitcoin to anyone except yourself and you will not risk losing anything.

@_date: 2017-10-07 14:39:12
You can send from any amount of utxos and to any amount of addresses at the same time in one transaction yep. 
In fact whenever you send bitcoin your wallet automatically picks enough inputs to cover your sent amount and creates an output to the specified address but also one output for you to get the change. Since you can only spend one utxo once you end up with a surplus of bitcoin that is simply sent back to your own wallet.

Segwit is completely unrelated to the fork. You're fine. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:48:52
Educate yourself on what is going on. 
Use your knowledge to actively educate others. 
Use your knowledge to choose where your business goes. E.g. if you conclude that Segwit2x is wrong (and after reading up it is my hope that this is the case), see if your exchange or wallet etc are for or against Segwit2x. 
The more users who stand firm against the hostile takeover attempt the better. 
More importantly is making sure people are aware of this. The attackers are doing their best to convince everyone that this is in everyone's interest and only the "dumb core devs" are against it. But that's far from the case. So spread the word and put pressure on whoever you're doing business with to make their stance on Segwit2x clear or change it if they're for it still.

It’s growing every day. It’s growing at a very good pace tbh. It’s only been active since end of august, so within the span of two months it’s almost hit 20%. Pretty amazing since nobody knew if it would ever be activated (thanks miners...). Your choice not to see that is a conscious one.
As for LN, it’s being worked on in case you didn’t notice. There’s a new desktop version from one team since last week I think. It’s a bit childish to complain about something just because the devs haven’t finished the software.  Kind of like a baby crying cause dinner isn’t ready yet.

There will no doubt be nodes dedicated to relaying transactions between the two chains so yes you can pretty much expect your coins to be spent on both sides. 
Sending to yourself is of course fine. You end up sending both types if replayed. Sending to someone else means you give them both types of coins. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:11:01
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:53:07
Yes you can. The sender can double spend the coins if the effort warrants it. 
Make sure you have 4-5 confirmations or more depending on the amount before you consider it in your hands. 
Sending it to someone else is simply an extension of this. If the person sending you bitcoin double spends it your transaction sending to someone else will be canceled along with the payment to you. 
This especially applies to 0 confirmations.

LN is literally at the doorstep. The details are all laid out already. Everyone was just sorta waiting for the miners to give us segwit.

Bitmain is owned by Jihan Wu, one of the driving forces behind Segwit2x/b2x. His miners have dominated the market in terms of efficiency for some time and that’s lead to a slightly unhealthy distribution of hashpower in his favor. 
Maybe it got to his head or something but now he thinks the miners are the owners of bitcoin, which isn’t good for the community. 
Anyway giving money to him would be unfortunate. There are alternatives eg 
But they’re not cheap. Wish I had a viable alternative. If I did I’d be joining you even if it means mining at a slight loss.

@_date: 2017-10-07 11:46:57
If you use opt-in after the fork (NOT before) then yes. You can send to someone and also send a tiny amount to the 3Bit address and your transaction will not be valid on B2X chain.
You can then spend the B2X utxos without worrying. Well in theory. In practice due to how utxos work you may end up sending unprotected coins anyway and having the tx replayed despite your efforts. 
I think the safest approach is to wait for your wallet to be updated to do replay protection for you. And hope it isn't buggy in its implementation. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:43:46
Yeah you wanna avoid bitFlyer. Their CEO is a fucking nutcase.

If you have a trezor things get a bit more straightforward I think. wait for trezor to announce support for b2x and then you should be safe. Haven't heard of them screwing up and they seem legit. (May wanna wait a bit and see if you see anyone complaining before sending large amounts.)

Your definition of “bashing” is off. I’m giving a counter argument to the statement that breadwallet is acceptable. The OP may not want to use a wallet whose devs are pro NYA. Or they just want a wallet that is compatible with bitcoin post-fork.
In either case there’s no guarantee breadwallet devs won’t take measures to ensure you’re connected to a b2x node so I’d still argue against it. 
Edit: he’s literally saying “the ones not supporting s2x”. Wtf is your problem. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:40:08

It’s technologically superior for a number of reasons, one being the infrastructure behind it such as ATMs or merchants accepting it and so on. 
It also has a pretty solid dev team with a long history of not fucking up which makes it more trustworthy than alternatives. 
Miners follow profit and as long as bitcoin profit goes up miners will grow in number. If enough miners got had a POW change might not actually change too much as there would be an explosion of new miners wanting a part of the sudden vacancy for a coin that is proven to be worth a lot of money.

The resistance stems from the fact Satoshi built bitcoin on the principles that it cannot be controlled by some government body somewhere. It's a self governed independent payment system. 
Segwit2x, regardless of its intentions, is exactly what Satoshi was aiming to avoid -- it's controlling the future of bitcoin via governance. It's not government per se but if a bunch of business folks can go into a room, close the door, and decide how bitcoin should change, regardless of the users no less, that means Satoshi has ultimately failed. Bitcoin is a failed project. 
Some people might find value in this failed project. After all it's made a lot of people rich and will continue to do so for some time I'm sure. But for some people this is more than about getting rich quick. It's a revolution.

Great plan. As long as you have your private keys you are in control. Once the fork happens and dust settles, if the two chains are both still alive, you can come back and someone will post a way to secure your coins on both sides. 
Don't send anything after the fork and you'll be okay. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:56:25
Anyone can at any moment take the bitcoin chain and fork it and do anything they want to it. In fact nobody would even be slightly angry or upset if you did exactly that. 
The thing is, though, no one is gonna buy your coin or use it unless you market it somehow. So you have your own fork of bitcoin worth $0. It's all good. If your fork is cool enough with enough features people want it may one day even be worth something. Before it is though, would you even care if someone replayed your transaction on their $0  coin fork? Of course not. You wouldn't even know about it. You might get grumpy later if it suddenly rose in price but at $0, even 21 million is $0.
The issue is when someone says "hey this is bitcoin" and a bunch of big companies with customers say "yup yup that is so". Because it isn't. It's a fork just like the blepcoin fork you or I created above. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:15:54
That's not true. The NYA was spawned from the UASF movement. It was a way to avoid telling the community that the miners do not in fact make the rules. S2x is surprisingly bold to be honest. I would expect them to fold and blame core for the lack of community support by now. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:45:19
Except that would reveal the b2x chain as being completely empty when everyone is using the real bitcoin, and everyone would immediately realize b2x is NOT bitcoin.

If you’re able to get the things you need with bitcoin then you can put more of your income in bitcoin. Even though you spend you’re actually refilling at the same time. Even with sudden dips you usually end up with profit.
You put $100 into bitcoin. Bitcoin goes up in the time until you need those $100. During this time it may have dipped and you overpay by a bit or it rose and you’re now paying less. The latter seems to be the case most of the time so you’d end up profiting even though you invested money you couldn’t invest (you needed that money for living).

So four quarters is not a dollar?
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:42:58
Sigh. 
So what will ultimately happen is that wallet devs will add code that detects the condition "at least one input is from a block &lt; forkblock". When this happens the wallet will automatically add an outpoint sending to 3Bit... and possibly warn the user that this is recommended. User will probably have option to exclude it. 
The wallets will also have to change their coin select logic to account for the extra cost of adding the outpoint as well as the minimum amount sent.  If they include 1+ old utxo they need the extra output. If they manage to fund the transaction without using any old utxos the cost of the transaction is lower. 
Alternatively wallets may track existing payments to 3Bit... and may in fact attempt to SPEND one of these instead (because they are anyone can spend) which would have the exact same consequence (because the utxo does not exist on b2x) in terms of replay protection. 
The problem with the latter is obviously that if two transactions try to spend the same 3Bit anyone can spend, only one of them will be accepted and the other will be considered a double spend or the former. 
The pro is that you would get a tiny amount from the utxo and you would spend it so the utxo set would shrink.

We can't really assess if they actually are full or not, for two reasons:
1. A major hashpower holder is mining empty blocks. 
2. Several spam attacks on the network have been observed, some dating back to 2015. 
First item is by a key member of Segwit2x. This alone makes it hard for me at least to put any trust in Segwit2x. 
Second item could be by proponents trying to prove that big blocks are needed, but that's of course very hard to prove. 
I'm positive towards a block increase if well timed and properly executed with widespread support from the users. You'll have a hard time convincing me Segwit2x is well timed or has widespread support.

No segwit has a maximum weight of 4 MB. But that could only be achieved if 100% of the transactions in the block were signatures which they can't. In reality it looks like the max is around 2 MB.

I really liked your response. It was very insightful and gave me a better idea of what people see as the problem. Unfortunately most of the comments I see elsewhere are downright loopy and hard to take seriously.
Regarding Core: I agree that it's not entirely neutral, and I think there's work to be done there. More developers and more opinions would, I think, help remedy the problem. 
BTC1 with a single developer whose only contributions have been to merge the changes coming in from Bitcoin is not an improvement, however. I would call it a major regression. Most devs have also expressed the opinion that they do not intend to "switch over" even if Segwit2x becomes Bitcoin.
That Core "shepherds" the community is something that I've never felt is a problem, personally; I see it as a hard earned trust over the last decade that "these guys won't fuck up; they're trustworthy". If it becomes too much, and people blindly follow without thinking for themselves, that is a problem, and definitely not what Satoshi had in mind, I think. I am not sure we're in that position though. 
Regarding the Core / blockstream agenda: I hear this a lot, but I'm honestly not sure what to make of it. I agree that some people are a bit rough around the edges and hard to communicate with, but they're tech geeks.. I think that's kinda normal with that kind of people. A hard fork, to a lot of people, is the creation of an altcoin. No matter what the circumstances. Some people are more adamant than others. I personally think a HF will be inevitable at some point in the future, but I don't think that point is now.
Regardless, the agenda you speak of, is that "blockstream wants to take profit via sidechains"? I don't think that one holds very well, especially with Lightning Network and other alternatives, and I can't really see how they would profit from the situation. In contrast, if raising the block size would have caused more growth, their sidechains would still have a clear utility and MORE potential customers, which sounds like a win to me.
Regarding Core being stubborn / not seeing different perspectives: I'm afraid I wasn't around at the time when the huge problem with unconfirmed transactions was happening. What I can tell though is that there's been several spam attacks on the network, the most recent one being discussed reaching back to 2015. With Bitmain mining empty blocks and with these spam attacks, which could very well originate in the same people who advocate for a bigger block size (it makes sense, in a twisted sort of way, even though it's horribly disingenuous), it's hard to say if the problem was a real one, and if it was, to what extent it was a problem and not just the result of external factors rather than the block size.
I personally think a block size increase is a risky thing to do, and shouldn't be done without careful planning. One of my biggest objections to S2X is the lack of planning and testing, and lack of supporting devs to ensure it goes off as planned. It's one thing to make a new altcoin (e.g. bcash), but it's another to take the entire traffic of the system into a new untested system and just roll. A lot of research goes into hard forks by Core devs and others (you can see it at  so it's not like everyone is adamantly against the concept itself. Even Core devs.
As for why they chose for you when majority of community wanted low fees etc: I think it's really hard, if not impossible, to judge what exactly the community wants. Reddit isn't the entire community, it's just a (small? large?) part of it. And the people who yell the loudest and have the most alt accounts are not necessarily representative of the majority. I think the reason why might have simply been because there was no way to accurately measure what the users wanted. I see that repeated today, as we cannot measure what the commmunity as a whole wants, s2x or no2x. This sub is no2x dominated. The other sub is s2x dominated. This sub has more subscribers. Does that mean no2x is what the community wants? No idea.
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:18:07
The Ethereum devs and most of the community were all behind the fork and everyone thought it would "just work" and everyone would abandon the old chain. None of the devs are behind S2X.

People who want to be day traders keep the amount they’re comfy with in an exchange. If they’re happy selling and buying their entire wallet then that’s what they do. 
What people mean when they say “don’t keep your bitcoin on an exchange” is aimed at people who don’t wanna trade but just hodl. They buy occasionally and just leave it on the exchange even though they’re not actually trading it regularly.

They have a iOS client open source which uses a library that isn’t (last I checked). But the client on the App Store could be a different version and nobody would be wiser. 
This is all beside the point though. The OP is asking for a wallet that is going to support bitcoin after the fork. Yes you can point the breadwallet client at a node of your choosing. No you can’t guarantee it won’t connect to other nodes as well. The node might go offline at which point the client may query a breadwallet hosted node list to get alternatives rather than breaking down. This list would be exclusively s2x nodes because that’s what the breadwallet devs are opting for. 
I think Samourai seems promising but it’s still beta.

640k s9s are running the bitcoin network. If all 300k subscribers got an equivalent miner up we would have half the network hash. Before the split. Intriguing thought even if it's unrealistic.

Yeah I don't know this particular wallet but usually the fees go to the miners. They're giving you a more conservative estimate that your transaction will be mined. 100% of the fee goes to the miner who puts your transaction in a block. 
Maybe you should read up on how this works before you start throwing accusations around.

We prey on the weak fools who sell when things get a bit heated. 
I don't even feel ashamed about it. I mean most people here yell "hodl!!!111" all day long and if people can't get the hint I won't hesitate to buy their low sells. 
Or that's what I want to say. In reality I just buy whenever I have money to spare. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:10:33
Yeah a lot of people get this confused. The competitor count drops which means you mine more of the blocks even if there are fewer blocks overall.

It's an attack because it does not properly protect the users and its advocates are deceptive in how they are presenting it. 
I can give examples if you truly don't know what I'm talking about.

It's... a bit complicated but: if you get bitcoin before the fork you have bitcoin on both chains. That's cool you can sell the ones you don't believe in. Free money yay.  (Except if you fail to split the coins then you lose both..)
If you have bitcoin after the fork it's a little dependent on the way in which you got said coins.
If you got them on both chains you have to split them or you may end up giving someone free money. If you only got them on one chain you're good to go. No risk as long as you got them on the chain you believe in. 
The crux is, you may think the bitcoin chain is "bitcoin" but then you buy "bitcoin" on, say, Coinbase. Oops. They gave you Segwit2x coins saying they were bitcoin. Drats. You now have worthless shit alt coins that you don't want but you paid $4000 for them. :(
So yeah I would probably not buy any bitcoin for awhile after the fork until you know what you're getting.

The price could plummet for a month for all we know. Short term investments in bitcoin is the worst thing you could possibly do unless you’re a total gambler. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:51:03
You have to derive the public key from the ripemd160(sha256(pubkey)), which is not unfeasible with a QC I believe. Could be mistaken.

Ye of little faith.

You’re misunderstanding. 
Keeping your entire bitcoin stash on an exchange is a big risk. Exchanges are known to be hacked and aren’t protected like banks are. Ie if they lose a ton of bitcoins you probably end up losing some. 
Keep whatever you want to trade with on an exchange and pull the rest out into a hw wallet.

Not many devs will work on Segwit2x. This isn't out of spite or pride or anything like that. It's simply that the very things that inspire them to come back to bitcoin and contribute are the core fundamentals of bitcoin and most if not all devs think Segwit2x is a clear breach of those core fundamentals. 
That's not to say Segwit2x can't win. It can, if the users migrate to it. Consider this though: there are people who believe so hard in bitcoin that they held coins they bought for dust when they hit 10x, 100x, 1000x their initial value. These people probably held because they believe in and are inspired by the very same core fundamentals of bitcoin that drives the developers. 
People who are in this for profit and don't care otherwise might join s2x but I am dubious about the rest. That's a lot of whales waiting to crush the price of your new altcoin.
BCH did not see any of this because BCH was never a threat to bitcoin itself. This time I imagine things will be quite different. 
I could be wrong of course. Perhaps the old timers and whales are all dying for a 2x block size. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:21:00
Segwit: a fix in bitcoin for malleability which also slightly increases capacity in blocks. 
Segwit2x: a fork coming in November that changes block size to 2 MB from 1 MB. They are intentionally using the name to confuse people like yourself into thinking they are the same thing. They have nothing in common. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:23:28
Yep. So whatever you think is irrelevant. They decide.

Did you look at that thread? A valid concern was raised (attribution missing) and a bunch of unrelated nonsense was the bulk of the responses (stop wasting your time and get back to work etc).
Why not just respond to the raised issue? Disappointing read tbh.

The original sender can give him the coins and then double spend them after a short while depending on the resources at their disposal and some luck. 
As for 3 confirms. It depends on the amount. The higher the amount the lower the probability of a reorg. Usually 6 is a fail safe number though there have been occurrences of more blocks in a reorg.

Nobody knows but they’re sticking with the NYA. And their CEO is crazy so I wouldn’t be surprised if he tried to pull something like that off.

This. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:40:33
It’s simplified to number of leading zeroes. In reality the difficulty is a 256 bit number and your block hash (also a 256 bit number) must be smaller than the target. 
If target is 
then you must have a hash
(Strictly speaking one of those ?’s must be zero but still.)

Once they release an update to their wallet app of course. Sending right after the fork will fuck you over just as with any other wallet.

His company specializes in deanonymizing people on bitcoin. If he managed to get control over the master implementation of bitcoin he could hard code his own nodes as seed nodes and could with a few lines make all bitcoin nodes connect to his nodes by default. Imagine the amount of information he would gain by having most nodes tied to his own?

It is, for various reasons. One of which you will experience first hand in roughly a month.

Oct is bitcoin gold, which is a scam way too many people are talking way too much about. If it had any major effects on the price of bitcoin it would be disheartening to say the least.
Nov is still some time away and people are remembering that they got free money in august from holding so the fork is actually causing people to buy more / sell off other coins for bitcoin. It may drop as people get cold feet closer to F day. It may drop after. Or not at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:19:19
Due to the ongoing 51% attack the security is currently 0, right? So any change would be an improvement in security.

They are not really in a position to choose. Presumably they will support both once it is possible to split your coins.

If a corporate takeover is successful then bitcoin turned out to be a failure and very few of the core devs are interested in working on a failed project.

It’s not possible to merge two chains but you can unify them into one chain. The UASF happening some months ago would have consumed* the other chain if it ever got enough hash power to outrun it. That was the big pants-shitting concept for the miners cause they risked all the profit from mining the other chain if it ever became a minority chain. 
(* the other chain would have reorged into the UASF chain as soon as the latter had more accumulated work than the former because UASF chain was still valid from the perspective of the other chain, just not the other way around. No wonder they came up with the NYA to change the narrative on that one)
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:34:29
The difficulty will be exactly the same so current miners who stay will actually make the same or more due to higher fees from stacking transactions. 
They will have a higher chance of finding the next block but it will take longer so it’s almost the same as if they lost the race under normal circumstances. (Slightly advantageous but not by a lot I think.)
Getting a miner during that time would be more profitable because you’d have less competition so your hashpower would make up a bigger portion of the network. Just don’t get an antminer or anything else from Bitmain. You’d be paying the very people you’re trying to fight against with the miner.

You would think he would have learned by now that bitcoin is all about not requiring trust. You can make an atomic swap because you don't have to trust the other party. That's the whole point.

Blockchain.info are Segwit2x signatories so they may decide to throw your bitcoin in the trash can and hand you Segwit2x coins. If that's a risk you're willing to take go for it. Otherwise move to a wallet you control.  That way you get both coins.

They give themselves the right to define what Bitcoin is. Ie they may one day say that DonaldFuckForkCoin is bitcoin and you’d be buying that thinking you bought bitcoin.

Some miners will provide a bitcoin faucet for free so you can split your coins without being a super genius. And ledger, trezor, etc will come up with a way to split despite the lack of replay protection. 
Unfortunately a bunch of ppl will lose a bunch of money after all is said and done.
