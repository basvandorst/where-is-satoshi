In July 2010 a bitcoin cost $0.08. That was the best time to buy bitcoin. Seriously, for $1, you would have 12 whole bitcoins + some change. Imagine having dropped $100 in it then. That Benjamin would be $8 million right now.

Hol up, if you stock it with say 10 hundred dollar bills, could you basically watch the price all the time and keep withdrawing when it’s high and depositing when it’s low, day after day, swing trade after swing trade?

It’s corrupted by futures manipulators now. Buy the deep dips and sell after about 5-7% gains wait a week and repeat.
