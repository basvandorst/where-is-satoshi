Have people used botnets yet for mining purposes? What about AWS or another virtual machine? Also, what if I bought a few ASICS and plugged them into the free power?

I already threw them out though :(

Have something like that sitting in my closet. There even might be a few new 1080TI’s out in my trash assuming they haven’t come by and picked them up yet

Let's say I have a few thousand dollars of AWS credit that I got for free, then could it be profitable? ;)

are there any coins that are profitable to be mining on a small scale right now? I have a 1060 and 980 I could mine with
