If you have any faith in a centralized exchange you are by definition a weak hand. Consider exiting crypto instead of whining.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:01:05
If you can't handle this, you are a weak hand and should be shaken out!
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:11:08
Down with centralization!

If you trust any centralized entity you are a dumb weak hand and deserve to be shaken out.

Yeah, shame on Valve and other weak hands.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:28:14
That's what happens when you sodl. Just HODL!!
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:33:09
Doesn't matter. Someone along the way will choose to HODL and enjoy the ride. Not to mention the strongest merchants don't know what Fiat is - they drive Lambos.

You wanna bring regulations to crypto? Get out weak hand!

Price going up more than compensates the meager fee. And yes Segwit and LN will fix the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:56:59
It's not binary. I can HODL my coins AND spend them. I just don't convert them to Fiat. I do miss how smooth and cheap transactions are back in the day but I also believe whatever problem we have will be fixed.

This is hugely bullish. Big G in the game finally.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:52:10
Well the article did say there's no guidance at all on how soon you can rebuy. IMHO a couple of hours is eternity in the crypto world.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:37:28
No. $3000 applies to regular income not capital gain. There's no limit to the amount of loss you can claim against your capital gain. That's effectively what Trump did. So if you made money on stocks but loss on crypto your gains can potentially be tax free.

@_date: 2018-02-01 22:36:31
That's true for any capital loss. You don't lose anything by locking it in.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:27:39
I call that tax deferral and consider it a good thing.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:46:21
It will be interesting to see how the miners respond though.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:20:38
Stay out of the market long enough so that the Korean ministers can spread conflicting FUDs? I can convince the IRS to think that's enough.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:13:14
You can interpret immediately differently. To me a couple of hours is eternity in the crypto world.

If they can't get my Donald to pay, they won't go after me. Even if they did go after me, the tax codes are on my side.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:32:42
Wash sale doesn't apply to crypto because they are not securities. Just sell low and buy back immediately to lock in your capital loss write-off.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:22:11
Long term.

Buddy you think way too high of the Chinese government. The current situation is simply Xi jinping and Wang qishan trying to make sure nothing goes wrong before the election in October, where they are trying hard to remain in power. Opponents, or supporters of Jiang zemin are growing strong. If they take the seats back you will soon see the bans lifted.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:12:13
They just fired another one over Japan. How sensible it is for Japan to believe in BTC.

I'm serious. Buy and HODL
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:00:22
Sure you **might** pay higher taxes next year if crypto bounces back, but:
1. That's not guaranteed. You might not even need to pay higher taxes if crypto is still low next year.
2. You still deferred tax payment.
So it's a net benefit. How cool is that?

No. He's already making compromises by letting Wang qishan retire. Jiang's supporters will cumback forsho.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:54:40
Not necessarily. Your short term capital loss in crypto can be used to offset your short term stock gains. Your long term crypto loss (unlikely) can offset long term stock gains. See below:
"Losses on your investments are first used to offset capital gains of the same type. So short-term losses are first deducted against short-term gains, and long-term losses are deducted against long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain. So, for example, if you have $2,000 of short-term loss and only $1,000 of short-term gain, the net $1,000 short-term loss can be deducted against your net long-term gain (assuming you have one). If you have an overall net capital loss for the year, you can deduct up to $3,000 of that loss against other kinds of income, including your salary and interest income, for example. Any excess net capital loss can be carried over to subsequent years to be deducted against capital gains and against up to $3,000 of other kinds of income. If you use married filing separate filing status, however, the annual net capital loss deduction limit is only $1,500."

We all expose to great market risk in the space of crypto. When the Korean ministers were spreading conflicting FUDs within a couple of hours, I don't think a wash sale was for the avoidance of tax.
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:54:39
As a native Chinese speaker I don't think the original report was only talking about ICOs.
"The crack down isn't limited to the ~60 ICO token exchanges. It includes several cryptocurrency exchanges not involved in ICO and urged them to shut down by a given time."
Whether the news itself is fake, I don't know. Caixin is viewed as a mouthpiece of the Chinese government though.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:09:33
You can sell low and buy back immediately to claim capital loss. Wash sale doesn't apply to crypto because it's not a security.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:20:59
That Crypto trade has gone haywire is just a claim made by Xi loyalists. His opponents disagree.

It's a party election to decide the members of the Politburo, especially the standing committee.

Caixin is definitely a mouthpiece for Wang qishan &amp; Xi jinping, while the censorship comes from Liu yunshan, etc.

It really depends on if the military is able to stage a coup. A failed attempt against Hu happened in 2012. It's unclear if Xi has gained total control over the military.

It was actually very democratic before Xi came into power. Nowadays it's more authoritarian as Xi is seeking absolute control. Let's see if his opponents can turn the tide.
