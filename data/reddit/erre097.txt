There is a reason you can adjust the blocksize of Bitcoin. It's a tool we have for dealing with adoption like we've seen the last few months, but for some reason we're not using it. I'm not saying the blocksize should grow exponentially forever like some want with BCH, but it's just dumb to keep it at 1 mb when we have fees aroumd 20$....

If this one comment scares you I think you might have a bit too much of your money in BTC. If that is the case I would at least sell enough so that you don't have to be constantly afraid of the price dropping to 0.

You mean the family that bought in under 5000? I bet they're doing fine

Can I ask you what your understanding of bitcoin is? Honestly curious. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:27:10
What. How are faster confirmations for the worse?
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:48:19
Yeah thats generally what you have to do?

I'm sure most BCH supporters wouldn't care about this tho. The plan is not to be a profitable investment, but for crypto to replace fiat :)

Nice gatekeeping you got going on there dude

Of course, but the motivating factor OP is suggesting is only that we want bitcoin to stay decentralized. If bitcoin needs volunteers to work it's obviously not a good solution.

If people have to mine at a loss to even keep bitcoin afloat, something else will take it's place. You can't rely on the good will of a few people...

Price going up from $3000 too $4000 is going to have a much stronger effect on people's behavior than going from even $1 to $10 though

If I accidentally buy Coca Cola Zero instead of a regular Coca Cola, is that the Coca Cola Company's fault?

Not the metric system though!
