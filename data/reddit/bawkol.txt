How fucking aweful do you have to be to just blame someones poverty on them being an idiot? And your genius fucking solution to their poverty is them investing in some imaginative currency that has and had no guarantees?

You are so fucking dense. Im not judging you for calling this person out today. I am judging you for saying he was stupid for not investing foodmoney into a retarded backyard internet project when he was poor. NO ONE couldve predicted this growth 7 years ago, and when you act like a bitch to someone for not predicting it, you just out yourself as a total retard.

And that sacrifice comes in the form of buying this imaginative cash that you cannot know will pay off? How delusional are you?

Well the problem is that they take a fee when i withdraw it, so i would rather keep them there as long as the fork doesnt ruin it
