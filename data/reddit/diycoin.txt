Plug and Play Tech Center is looking to invest in Bitcoin as well. I believe they're looking for 6+ investments in the next year.  They are holding a Bitcoin/FinTech EXPO on 12/5/13: bitcoin.org/en/events where they hope to source/vet some of the startups looking for funding.

6.5 billion unbanked people in the world. Many of which face capital controls or inflationary fiat on a daily basis. To assume the current financial solutions are adequate in parallel to the current state of information available amongst the Internet is naive. The monetary systems as you know it today are as archaic as a cavalry or morse code.

Yep!

Thank you so much!  I've got a slideshow that I'd like to show you (if you could give feedback, that'd be awesome).
Yeah, getting lots of KYC concerns.  As far as your numbers/ecosystem, what were you referring?
I'm mostly pointing to market cap (1.4b) and transaction  over time...  You wouldn't know what the type of sales volume some mining companies have had (i.e. butterfly, avalon, terrahash, etc)
Thanks again for your help!
