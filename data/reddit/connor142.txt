Looks like you may be in for the long run

Yeah I deposited some cash in coinbase earlier this week, I find it funny how the money was taken out of my bank account, but still isn't available on coinbase
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:52:51
I agree it is a nice investment but I wouldn't throw all my savings into it, you never know what may happen.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:46:33
My advice would be to get in when you can! It's never too late! And yes ether has increased significantly in dollar value
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:00:55
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:12:48
awesome!!!! i did something similar ;)
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:29:43
Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:51:03
Ahh I see, I would have to agree with you there!
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:18:57
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:34:34
I predict a further drop but who the fuck knows lol
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:29:34
I know it's like shut up we don't say that word! I'd love to buy some more at a lower price though! Lol
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:25:06
They are busier than normal with all these new people joining just like you 
just give them time
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:58:38
Seems like all sources suggest the only place it's going is up. Makes me wonder if a total crash  would ever happen to Bitcoin, similar to 2013. ��
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:13:49
I wouldn't buy now, and the value will always be fluctuating 24/7
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:54:53
I like your style
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:49:53
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:47:03
I'm curious, does anyone foresee a crash like in 2013!?!
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:33:24
Do not put all your eggs in one basket! Bitcoin is extremely volatile. Yes you can make a lot o money in the long run but you could potentially lose a lot of money too! 
No risk no reward as they say
Invest in Bitcoin if you want, but I would suggest looking at some other cryptocurrenies that are starting to gain steam!!
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:12:22
I'm glad I got in at 350 ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:04:12
I call coinbase a piece of ish that keeps crashing
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:10:05
Yeah 1000 dollars in both directions in about one week is volatile at all....
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:44:55
Some day :)
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:44:45
you think Ltc will be the next to blow up? I'm really surprised with ether, I remember when it was only 8 bucks.....
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:26:31
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:00:39
Same lol
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:25:57
Yeh sure go ahead and buy more
You have my permission
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:08:34
I'd have to disagree and say there will be even more growth in the future
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:44:33
Petty fools!
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:46:16
It was definitely a good id a to make some money while we were up
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:14:24
Trade between different coins or trade your Bitcoin on paxful, local Bitcoin, bitstamp etc......
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:29:05
.35 wouldn't throw up any red flags with the bank....
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:36:31
Well we just broke 2200, what's going on?
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:52:23
This has been the common prediction from many sources, makes me kick myself for not getting in sooner! Hopped on around 350 :)
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:18:25
The only thing you can do is read and do some research, then keep reading and do some more research lol cryptocurrencies can be extremely volatile so it's very important to keep up with all the news and what's happening in the cryptocurrency world. My friend teaches a course on trading cryptocurrency for a small fee if you are interested!
