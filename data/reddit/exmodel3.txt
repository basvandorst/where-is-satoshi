because otherwise you would have millions of new blocks that couldbe used when the 10 minute timer is over? how you going to decide which one is getting the place?
@_date: 2018-09-07 15:20:12
how do you determine which block was found first if you can find 1 million blocks in 1 second?( because your suggestion doesnt  want to work with increased difficulty aka more zeros in the beginning)
currently the system is quite obvious as the difficulty is very high its not easy to find  a block so whoever finds one will publish it asap and therefore be the next in the chain

did you login with email adress or account name?
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:49:22
did you search your emails for mtgox term ? or are old emails deleted already?
why would you have signed up for btc-e though and not mtgox? maybe you were just checking tehir website out and trying it?
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:56:25
their database withe mail adresses and account names leaked in mid 2011. so if you think you might have signed up before that date you can google the leaked data  and search your account.
there was another data leak after the bankruptcy but that didnt contain names nor email adesses so its impossible to research there
@_date: 2018-08-24 22:16:21
yes but that means you must have signed up before 2011
@_date: 2018-08-24 22:04:05
weleak doesnt have mtgox leaked database

how can you derive other private keys if you have  one private key of that seed?
Is there any informations about that?
@_date: 2018-05-23 07:48:19
lets say coin X is currently 1000 USD and i will sell it for 800 usd
than the price will not drop to 800 usd because there are proably buy orders placed at 9900, 9800, 9700, 9600 etc..
the seller dont decide the last market price
so  dropping the coin to 800 usd would only work if I sell a huge amnount of coins or if there is no volume and market depth with that coin

bitcoin is a safe investment if you dont follow stupid facebook advertisment and just buy and hold it by yourself
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:10:49
yes we were spammed by joger ver and jihan wu who pushed bitcoin cash onto the newbies.
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:11:59
what? With buying the bitcoins you are already invest. why would you invest a investment?
just hold it
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:28:47


Just offer your motel the same way/ on the same channel as if you would do it when you sell it for USD.
Put a note in the sale listening that you accept bitcoin

Sorry but how are we getting the blockchain if everyone just has the snapshot? This would  mean that the  old blockchain gets lost over sometime and no one can re-verifiy it

No they are not busting users that sell or buy bitcoin with cash. If you are a normal  user you can buy and sell.
they are busting people that do this professional like a business and act as its a private sale. they are going after the big fishes that buy and sell everyday to make profit
@_date: 2018-07-11 03:35:00
it gets dumped as hell and price goes drastically down
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:52:22
what a bullshit story. you are not a full node if you use a snapshot, since a full node has the feature that other nodes can download the whole blockchain from them. and that is not possible, therefore you are a node but not a full node
@_date: 2018-04-22 10:28:43
this depends truly on your intelligence and behavior.
My  bitcoins are for example on 2 old laptop that dont have a wifi/netowork bluetooth card.
i removeed everything.
I do the transactions there and use a qr code that I can to copy the transaction and to sent it online with my phone/Second laptop

You could post your bitcoin adress here with 10000 BTC on it and no one in this world can take the money from your. not even the fbi or  cia, not even if you are osama bin laden in person-
no one can take the money, isnt that wonderful?
however if  you post your bank account every rogue governemnt can just seize your money

still this has no scientific value if they dont release the code.
its only scientific true if other people can replicate the effect
