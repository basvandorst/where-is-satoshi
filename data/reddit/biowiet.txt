This guy is either just trying to influence with this ridiculous bluff or he is so ignorant he didn't even do a minimal homework on the topic he was going to burp about. 
"burp... burp... prevent... burp.... bitcoin from becoming the digital equivalent of an anonymous Swiss bank account and ensure “bad people cannot use these currencies to do bad things.”"
In this case you mofo just don't put your dirty hands on it at the first place... neither "work together" with your bankster friends to do so. Show off your self-knowledge and quietly team-work up yourselves on gallows for the last cca. 100 years of corrupted proceedings. Waahh i could rage... this miserable shit has yet to learn about wallets other than online exchanges or even private keys. He wouldn't seem to be so dumb now if he's managed to keep his upper ass shut. This is utter bullcrap. 
I would rather like to think that he is just trying to manipulate.... can't be this stupid in such a high position.... or wait... :D

It also says May-Jun-Jul on horizontal axis and 1100-2000-3000 on the vertical axis if you try to focus on the more important parts of the chart.

I'd put it aside in a new wallet and wait if the exchange contacts me. It all depends how much they know your details, but I'd definitely wait if they're contacting me.
My reason is that I wouldn't trust the exchange. Even if it was/wasn't a glitch they could still keep the BTC for themselves anyway. History of exchanges tells me they scam people more often then the other way around.
Obviously if their argument is valid and I see proven that they're returning it to the legal owner I would not hesitate to return.

this is a 10 millió-billió Pengő note 
10.000.000.000.000.000.000 
1 millió  = 1.000.000
1 milliárd = 1.000.000.000
1 billió   = 1.000.000.000.000
see here: 
I still have a few of these and other notes as well as coins from my granny. :)
