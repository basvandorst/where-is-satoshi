How are we ensured that you won't end up like Moolah?

Wait, you mean the miners that I bought 6 months ago and are just now shipping? Lol.

Am I too late? I'll buy equity in your project.

Haven't gotten on confirm yet. But, would I have been better just getting tons of GPUs and just Scrypt mining?

This is a bunch of shit. Friends of mine have been ripped off.

Despite the myriad of improper formatting on your initial post, this posing the threat of someone losing their MSB license. If you'r looking for an equity partner or a VC, I'm down.

Exactly. I bought 3 machines (3000 GH/s) from KnCMiner and am banking on the return. It's not my only source of income, but hopefully I can just get my capital back and then make some coin (pun intended). After I found out about ButterFly Lab's scheme, I'm disgusted. Whilst the plan is BRILLIANT AS HELL, I bought that machine in a "new" condition.

Would you sell your 7970 for some Bitcoins? 
There are guides on YouTube for this. My suggestion would be to look at the charts and buy low-sell high.

Can we get a clearer picture? I want a new pair of Nikes!
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:10:59
So true! Rock on man. I'll definitely buy a kit.

Great idea. A concept like this is Soylent (fantastic movie by the way). My fear for this is what happens when you've hit all of the recipes that do not require a binder such as an egg? If you could make the non-perishable egg, I'll buy equity from you. Good luck!

Don't know how much this will help, but my lawyer is cool with the whole Bitcoin thing. We've had some issues in the past with local authorities, but he immediately gets it put down.

Said individual is ungrateful and I find it gross that they are blaming a family member for trying to push beliefs.

ButterFly labs is a joke

As we've seen before, Litecoin typically goes down when Bitcoin does. I'm predicting this will be the case. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 07:23:34
Sure. I'm interested. What price? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:11:01
Made about $75,000. I've been in it since Jan '13. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:08:50
So, wait, I get a 1 TH/s machine or I get the "service" for it? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:14:09
I personally don't mind if they do or do not. I'm in this for fun. The money I made is cool, but the community and the adoption of Bitcoin is what I'm truly advocating. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:55:30
I think I love you. Just bought a few.

Wow...... When eBay start to accept Bitcoin as a payment, you need to reply and say, 
"Dear eBay,
I'm removing my business because of your hypocrisy and lack of intelligence.
Love, Humanity"
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:32:28
Give me your price on all of them and I'll tell you which ones I'll buy.

Basically, if you were to buy drugs or illegal things, your identity is hidden through your choice of payment. With a Credit Card anyone can see who you are and where you live. Whereas Bitcoin, a non-refundable currency, masks it.
