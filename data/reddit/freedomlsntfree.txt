Here are two more:  
1. They disagree with SW's capacity increase and don't want to contribute to it
2. They don't give a shit about paying 50c/tx rather than 25c/tx because they are willing to pay 50USD/tx \(and orders of magnitude more\) to have a tx included in the first, most secure, immutable, global, censorship resistant and decentralized ledger.

Only from the perspective of an illiterate pleb maybe. For years people around here parrot something about "the internet of money" and "programmable money" then when we make use of the "programmable" part of bitcoin it suddenly isn't bitcoin anymore? Go back to cave you came from .

I always thought the get rich quick proletariat would one day steer Bitcoin into a less than favorable direction.
I know it's early, but seeing the dumbest fork themselves off onto a minority shitcoin certainly improves my outlook on Bitcoin.
Unless they actually manage to legitimately fill 100MB blocks, they will wither away much like dogecoin did in ltc's shadow... only in slow motion. If they manage to fill their blocks I doubt things will look much better.

We should ask the guy who tries to sync up a 10TB ethereum node by the end of 2019. By then King Vitalik will be issuing yearly signed States which we can trust without validating the entire ETH blockchain.
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:32:56
How is a miner controlled network with data centers, terabyte blocks and SPV wallets without validity proofs "peer to peer"? Ver and his sock puppets have made it abundantly clear that any participants on the network that do not mine are useless and a waste of resources.
If BCH is peer to peer then so is Paypal. I guess if your definition of "peer to peer" is being able to "send" USD from one "peer" to another.

Onecoin/Bitconeeeeect/Bcash itself isn't a scam. Onecoin/Bitconnect/Bcash was just software that never managed to manifest its true potential due to its "missmanagement". 
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:20:01
Neither Garzik nor "Core" get to decide what Bitcoin is. The program currently being executed on my desktop decides what Bitcoin is and I decide which program I run. 
This determines what Bitcoin is in my eyes and what I believe Bitcoin to be is the only thing that matters. If at some point my node suffers a hashrate based attack I will educate myself as to what measures I can delopy to circumvent the attack. 
At that point I don't care what you will do, I don't care what Ver, Wu, Bitpay and others will do. I don't care about speculating on what could, might or should occur. I don't care how much the bitcoin I hold will be worth in fiat. What I do care about is running the software that enforces the consensus rules that I agree to. 
This is the **core** principle that all of us, who have understood Bitcoin, continuously apply. It's the only thing that sets bitcoin appart from fiat and the only thing that gives it any value. People who have not yet grasped the significance of running their own full node to facilitate the trustless nature of Bitcoin and people who believe hashrate dictates the rules of the protocol are free to do as they please. I am curious to see where they are heading... my guess is off a cliff. But honestly I couldn't care less.

I'm also taking a stand against backroom deals, pr and social media campaigns with the purpose of circumventing open source development practice. 


Whether or not it's an attack is a matter of perspective. Call it an unreconcilable difference between us. I consider it manipulative of you to decry my perspective as disingenuous.


1. It's well tested and peer reviewed
2. It's as non-contentious as you'll ever see a BIP be again (aside from fixes that bring the protocol back from a fubar state)
3. It addresses multpile issues
4. It's a conservative and noncooersive
Segwit is an addition to the consensus parameters. No one is forced to use segwit. Even miners don't have to use it. All that was asked of miners was to make sure they exclude intentionally malicious tx from blocks that would result in a possible contentious network split... the thing which we are all attempting to avoid.
SW2x throws out all precautions, tradeoffs and compromises that SegWit was celebrated for. 2x is the antithesis to everything that Segwit was supposed to achieve and if people don't start to grasp that any time soon we might just all switcht to Bitcoin Cash because honestly: What exactly is the difference? It's copy and pasted code. With a different amount of hashrate. Come Nov. there will be more copy and pasted code. Why shouldn't 95% of the hashrate switch to BCH? What's the difference between the 3 forks if a 5 man agreement and some hashrate is all that it takes for us to determine the real Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:15:12
It's unique selling proposition is a bait and switch. It pretends to be "the real Bitcoin" and aside from that there is nothing setting it apart from BTC. Every other shitcoin at least tries to convince people with some technobable that they are better... Bcash just claims it's Bitcoin... nothing else.

Let's hope Bitcoin contributes to redistributing some of the market share in the porn industry. Mindgeek already shot itself in the foot with a shitcoin. Last thing I heard was their crypto payments didn't work and I doubt they bothered to fix it considering no one used them. That is unless the entire thing wasn't a pump and dump advertisement scam.

A security genius? I'd say he's a glorified vacuum salesman that went from door to door spreading FUD on one hand while selling a solution from the other. 99&amp; of the industry he was involved in does nothing but trawl the web for known malicious programs. Writing anti virus software for the general consumer market is the lowest hanging fruit in the it security sector. 
McAfee was at the right place at the right time. I am not aware of any PageRankesque feat that he accomplished that would warrant calling him a genius.

Don't worry BCH will fail for the same reason Dogecoin did. Over time the larger coin with higher payouts will displace the smaller one. I doubt bcash will ever be merge mined with Bitcoin and I doubt there will be any bcashers left when the supply cap is increased.

Both subs are moderating away opposing views because most people that bother going into the opposing fraction's echo chamber, do so to troll.
Careful with calling their altcoin "bcash" though. That will get you banned over there.
