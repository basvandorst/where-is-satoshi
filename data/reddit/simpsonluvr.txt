There is way to much money transferred every day for them to actually check more than a tiny percentage of transfers. And I am sure they only look at transfers with what they think are suspicious patterns. Plus a couple random ones to learn what they might be missing. I pay my taxes so I don't worry about it at all.

I've been happy with their service for the last couple of years. Which I pay for with an old fashion debit card.

I used to spend pennies to spend bitcoins and get a discount. I just spent ~$50 to make three transfers to an offline wallet. And it took hours. That is about the same cost as a bank transfer. It feels like it is already broken.

A few years ago I bought $300 of bitcoins on coinbase. I spent $60 on tea. I spent $160 on a fancy platinum power supply I still use today. Both sites gave me a discount for using Bitcoins to offset the money they saved in credit card fees. I now have $6,000 of bitcoins in change. Where can I spend that today?

They did but they write their dates backwards so we didn't get the message until 11/9.

That seems like the same list as three years ago. Where are the discounts? How come that list hasn't expanded?

What is wrong with the wallet? Does it not work? Has anyone lost coins?

Only if it is a Friday.

TLDR; *If* the Lightning Network works as promised Bitcoin will be golden.

Maybe we should look at a more reputable [source.]( They are going to implement regulations. That makes it legitimate. It is a good thing.
"We refuse the risk of speculation and possible financial embezzlement related to bitcoin ,

Coinbase has extra verification procedures before you can withdraw large amounts. I had to go through extra verification when I switched countries, not because I have lots of coin. It took about ten days. Some of those days were because I was switching countries.
