It's math. 
Your fees are .25% when you buy or sell, so for a round trip you have to buy back at least .5% lower to come out ahead.  $11575 is only .215% lower than $11600, so you lost money.

I don't have much BTC at the moment, buy will be buying more and want to protect it. Sounds like a Trezor should keep it safe, but in the case of something catastrophic like a fire where the Trezor is destroyed, I could keep the seed words in a safe deposit box. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2019-03-07 01:37:51
Thanks, this is what I was looking for!
@_date: 2019-03-07 01:26:46
The passphrase you are referring to is the "25th" word, right?
@_date: 2019-03-07 01:23:26
Thanks for that perspective. If you don't mind me asking... how do you protect your coins (assuming you have some)?
@_date: 2019-03-07 01:22:23
I figure the Trezor would be my main tool, but just wanted to know if the paper backup would work in case the Trezor gets destroyed, or lost. Thanks for the answer.
@_date: 2019-03-07 01:27:43
Thanks... that is why I'm asking. :)

No maker fees if you trade more than $50M/month. So maybe we just need to up our game.
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:26:56
It is about $45 in parts, though the 4 16x16 white plates make up almost half of the total cost.

Not begging... just showing it off. :) If any coins end up in the address I’ll donate them to UNICEF... I think I read they just started taking crypto donations.
Edit: Low and behold, somebody decided to actually use the code to send me .0000069 BTC. I can't imagine where they came up with that specific amount. /s
Of course that did force me to look further into the UNICEF Crypto Fund, which doesn't appear to accept random donations. So instead, the funds will be donated to The Water Project.

The QR I made is 29x29 and already uses 1x1 Lego plates, so it couldn't be reduced by 50% (or at all).
You may be able to go smaller if it is possible to use smaller QR code matrix to represent a Bitcoin address, but I don't know the answer to that.
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:29:01
Essential tool for a Lego enthusiast...

@_date: 2019-10-09 16:28:28
Yeah, wasn't sure if it was going to work, but was excited to see it works on most QR scanners.
@_date: 2019-10-06 15:23:17
Pertaining to (1)... sounds like I have to let electrum generate the seed and can’t enter my own seed words... does that mean I can’t use a passphrase as well?

This is a custom build... meaning I bought all of the pieces separately. If there is enough interest, I could potentially make some simplistic instructions and put together some kits. :)

Standard disclaimer (Not financial advice, check with your accountant), but yeah... wash sale rules apply to securities, of which Bitcoin is not, so you should be able to reset your basis whenever you want until they clarify the rules.
@_date: 2019-12-18 01:59:10


Seems like you answered your own question.
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:45:17
tl;dr... buy bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:44:48
I can't not hear this pop when I look at the picture.
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:33:20
Expose himself???
Why does McAfee want to see his junk?
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:37:33
Lets be honest, doesn't matter what the price is, this guy just really wants slightly less than 4 Bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-04-18 23:57:37
No one is forcing you to watch.
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:47:53
Okay, slightly racist.
@_date: 2019-04-18 23:58:41
But what if you run out of weed?
@_date: 2019-04-14 18:16:47
I guess this probably makes the most sense. If someone made a payment for .01 BTC and then the seller was able to see that the payment came from a stash of 10K bitcoins, it might put a target on the buyers back.
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:47:04
Bigger blocks = less decentralized.
@_date: 2019-04-18 23:59:28
Bitcoin will probably go up or down from here.
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:50:31
You mean the one IPO that is currently trading below its offering price?
@_date: 2019-04-18 23:55:58
You are asking a Bitcoin sub if you should buy bitcoin. 
Stocks are too much effort? You don't even have to do any work at a real company, just buy shares. Not sure how that can be easier.
If the "key to wealth" is income, Bitcoin doesn't have any income or dividend yield. 
My best advice is to do a lot more reading before "investing" in bitcoin.
Sorry for being a dick.
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:28:26
The real word you need to know is Dovish. As in, the fed is so Dovish, Bitcoin can't not succeed.

I just bought some avocados. Where can I resell them?
@_date: 2019-04-14 18:14:44
Pretty much every single address that I see on the list had been used more than once. Surprised me since I read exactly what you linked above.
@_date: 2019-12-18 01:52:11
$2000 per source would be sick.
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:04:54
Because you already forgave me for being a dick...
You don't have to pick stocks if you buy an index fund.
It doesn't sound like you want to invest. It sounds like you want to trade something. If that is the case, just remember that there are others who are investing 6, 7, 8 figures to make money off of other rookie "traders" like you.
There is no free lunch. Unless you have 8 figures already, then you don't need the free lunch.
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:43:51
Is that really still his claim to fame? How about being a billionaire investor?
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:10:33
Maybe a dumb question... I thought bitcoin addresses were supposed to only be used once. Why do all of the addresses have multiple "ins" and "outs"?
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:26:27
Omigod, omigod, it could be anyone. What if it is me and I don't even know it!?
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:43:28
Yes please.
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:21:50
I hope it is Kim Kardashian.
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:47:10
Glad you got your groceries.
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:40:59
Gotta be honest, you sound pretty racist.
@_date: 2019-05-09 01:08:12
This post is so Oct 2017.
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:30:23
Do you know if Trezor supports ignoring/marking the transactions unspendable... and once ignored/marked unspendable, can you reverse them back to spendable in the future?
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:33:04
If you want some more, buy it.
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:31:38
I’d probably just ignore them.
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:41:35
I concur.
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:40:33
Guess we should all pack it in and call it a year?
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:46:47
Pretty sure the guy in the picture has no idea what the fuck he is doing.
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:37:49
Um... buy some?
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:30:36
Thieves like money?
