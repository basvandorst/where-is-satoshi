Bitcoin is pseudo anonymous, meaning there aren't identities directly attached to the address (as you can create them freely without any information being provided), however through data mining and other techniques (KYC, etc...) you are able to infer that someone owns the address. Kind of like "this address is acting a lot like Bob, it's probably Bob." or "The exchange account registered to Alice, sent BTC to this address, it's likely owned by Alice."

Welcome u/Naiko32,   
For transacting and storing bitcoin there are a couple things to know at the beginning.  
Bitcoin wallets come with two types of addresses, public and private.   
Public: You can think of this as your public deposit address, you can send this around the internet and all people can do is send funds to it and look up information about it on the blockchain.   
Private: This is what you use to sign your withdrawals out of your wallet. Think of it as the PIN on your bank card, except much more important. If someone get a hold of this "private key" they have complete control over your wallet.   
Getting Started:   
1. Download a reputable wallet, there are a number of providers out there. I would recommend using someone with a big brand name attached for your peace of mind and user experience. I would go with Coinbase or Blockchain.info. I believe they would be very user friendly. (Call these Hot Wallets)  
   1. If you are storing amounts that are more than you are comfortable carrying around in cash in your physical wallet you should get a hardware wallet like a ledger or a trezor. These keep your keys from being exposed online. (I use these because of the greater security)(These are generally called cold wallets)   
2. You will have to write down 12-24 words. This is your private key in a human readable format. This key is EVERYTHING! Secure it, it is the only way to recover your funds if you lose your wallet or device. It is also the only thing someone will need if they want to steal your funds. (There are other crafty ways of getting peoples funds)
3. Generate a receive address. They look like this: [38br8qnixRLBfi217zNgET2Nvzh2RAGT9c]( (I just randomly grabbed this from the block-explorer. You can see all transactions on blockchain.info if you are interested.)
   1. I would recommend sending a small amount to the address to test the wallet, for peace of mind. Then send through the remainder. 
4. To withdraw from your wallet you just have to send from within your app and depending on it's structure you'll probably have to type in a PIN you chose. The app will then sign the transaction with your private key (your private key is not your PIN) (authorising them to be sent to another address). 
I hope this helps, if you have any questions send em through!

I see this as the market self regulating. There were an amazing amount of garbage offerings, a lot of people lost a lot of money. Now the market has matured, they are holding this projects to a higher standard.

If they are running a business it's unlikely they'll hold bitcoin and subject their business to market flacuations (exchange risk). 
It is also akin to "why not rob the man who uses cash?" There is a law and judicial system in place that works quite well to deincentivise theft. Be it crypto or cash. (This is a bigger problem in countries where the law isn't as easily enforced)  
Arguably, the governments primary role is to enforce property rights.

According to [cash.coin.dance]( the BCH chain is "6588 blocks ahead of the Bitcoin (BTC) chain".   
6588\*12.5 = 82,350. Which is the difference you'll see on CMC.com

Once you think it doesn't work you don't want it.   
Really there are two ways to get inflation, demand-pull and money supply.   
When the gov prints money it reduces its overall value (more money, less value it has).   
When people demand more than the supply it pushes up price (demand-pull inflation).   
With hyperinflation, which typically results from too much printing of money, the people begin to lose confidence that the state can control inflation. They expect that inflation will now continue or get even worse, they then start to buy now to avoid losing value on the dollar later, increasing demand pull inflation. Confidence his hard to earn and easy to lose. These problems are then made worse through stockpiling and shortages.

Given the 60% drop how well has it stored value?

Hey thanks! Great feedback.   
How do you think this would stack up for say finance students in a university?

Coinbase has records of your addresses and KYC. Identity can easily be associated.   
If you are concerned, you can shuffle your coins (governments already don't like this practice so I'm not convinced it's a great alternative, even if it is practically a good thing).   
You could send your coins to a decentralised exchange and trade them for something else.   
You could buy Monero and then trade that on an exchange without KYC, to then Buy BTC for example.   
This will cost you in exchange fees, but give you greater privacy.

You are correct, BTC gone is gone for good. (If the key is destroyed/lost so are the coins)   
Bitcoin can be measured in denominations as low as "satoshis" which are 0.00000001 of a BTC.   
In the future if there is a need to measure BTC in lower denominations, the network can vote to change this and measure in even lower denominations.

Considering the arguement against BTC that the fees are too high, I don't think this argument says what you think it says.

Clever? Depends how you measure it.  If you're talking price only the market knows and the market doesn't know shit(or it knows everything). 
Ethereum is interesting currently process around 2x the transactions of bitcoins for at least 10x cheaper (avg and median transactions). 
However the developers don't really consider ethers to be a currency (even though it is better than most as it stands). 
I see it as the oil to power the decentralized world. It's the fuel needed to secure the network (when it shifts to Proof of stake) and run its contracts.
if bitcoin was our generations gold rush ethereum is oil.

The detail on his screen. Very impressed.

You can't eat paper money either. Going to be an interesting ride.

It was $41 USD at May 2010 prices. This was the first real world transaction with BTC too, which added to it's value. Showing BTC can be used for real world goods and services. 
Thank you pizza guy!

I've always found to be very useful. 
What are your thoughts?
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:28:14
Fair points. Venezuela went through black outs recently, the banking system failed but people could still access bitcoin. 
Critiques are good, I see more concerning aspects with fiat. 
The fiat experiment started in 1971 when Nixon dropped the gold peg, then in 2008 the reserve increased the supply by 4x. It's in experiment I don't want to be apart of. 
Crypto provides an alternative. Not without its own concerns, but I do see benefits over fiat.

Can you please provide evidence?   
Just saying things doesn't make them true. Welcome to the real world.   
I'm happy for you to change my mind though.

How can you reduce the number and size of government programs without the government doing it?

It's cool seeing the history of BTC immortalised on these threads. Some interesting discussions involving Satoshi him/her/themsevles. 
@_date: 2019-05-22 00:12:40
I don't think they were though. Bitcoin was created in 2009, pizza guys post is dated May 2010 and silk road started in Feb 2011.
