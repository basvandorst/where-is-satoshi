They would die in a few days, if not hours, due to the miners leaving them in mass. 
Plus, as soon as the malign fork is discovered, the developers would most likely issue a warning on the net, effectively freezing most of the bitcoin operations and transactions.
Finally, if the 51% attack actually managed to reverse some big transaction, the mining community would probably agree to reverse fork the chain from a safe point before the attack, restoring the canceled transactions.

Every miner put a special transaction, called generation transaction ([here]( an example), in the block they're working on.

@_date: 2014-06-09 08:09:38
P2pool is less efficent under many aspects, take for instance the frequency at which blocks are found: ASICs must stop working for a fraction of second everytime a block is found, and this affects performances.

AFAIK the only client that support automatic sending of founds FROM a P2SH address (that is, spending bitcoins you received there) is still bitcoin-qt, but it needs the private keys of all the addresses used in the multisig, which kind of defies its purpose and in fact isn't applicable to this case. This use case ATM requires the use of raw transactions, and that's all but user friendly: it requires manual working with the RPC or the client console.
Luckly, almost every client supports sending founds TO a P2SH address, with the worring exception of blockchain.info's. This means that, as long as this service is used to put money that you won't need in a while, it could work for a realtively techie bitcoin user.

Each of you should create an address, maybe a vanity address with your initials and birth date in it, and fund it with a bitcoin (or any sum) each.

Voilà, as long as no one of you two pulls the money from the shared address your marriage shall be considered valid.

I was referring to the gain vs the amount of BTC you could've bought for the miner price at the time you preordered it. That's the only logical method to evaluate the return of a device whose only function is to generate bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:06:49
1st: using an insecure device. When you create a paper wallet you **MUST** use a volatile OS (read: live linux distribution) on a private, not-shared computer. It's not that hard, you just need a common USB thumbdrive and a tool like [YUMI]( to create a boot device that will give you a volatile OS.
2nd: Staying online while/after the wallet creation. You should disconnect from the internet as soon as you load the website you'll use for the creation (or downloaded the software you'll be using).
3rd: using advanced or shared printers. To print the wallet you should use the dumbest USB-connected printer you have. MFD printer/scanners/copier/fax should be avoided, and printing thru a shared printer connected to another computer is **NOPE**.
4th: using a non-standard password encryption. This is somewhat redundant now that BIP38 is widespread, but if you want to encrypt the private key on your paper wallet first make sure that it is done following the BIP38 guidelines.
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:44:11
That's not how the bitcoin protocol works. A legit client will always build his block on top of the lastest block available, be it his or someone else's.

When you ask a wallet to send money to some address it gathers enough unspent inputs to cover the sent amount plus fees and then, in the very likely event that the gathered amount is not exactly the amount you need, it creates a new address you own for the change.
This means that most transactions usually have just two outputs: the main destination address and the change address that you own. Not sure why you have three here. Is this your problem? There's a third destination address you don't own?

"We are the first real estate company in the world that accepts directly bitcoins as payment and we decided to do it for 3 reasons: we believe in Bitcoin; we can because the Ravenue Agency is one of the few in Europe that recognizes the cryptocurrency; there are a lot of young millionaire bitcoin users, who may want to invest a little fraction in an house" said Paolo Baretta, young CEO of the company.
However, the offer is also valid for those who didn't own any bitcoin and are eager to buy them temporarly in order to benefit from the offer.

Every hardware you may employ to mine bitcoins can be described money-wise by two coefficents: **$/MHash/sec** and **J/MH**.
**$/MHash/sec** stands for Dollars to MegaHashes/second, and it accounts the initial cost of the hardware. The greater this number is for a given hardware, the greater you will have to pay to buy the hashing power you wish.
**J/MHash** stands for Joules to MegaHash. It's the average energy your hardware needs to calculate a million of hashes, thus representing its power efficency. It's like the *Gallons per 100 Miles* parameter used in the car market.
That said, the advantage of FPGA over GPU mining rigs lies in the **J/MHash** parameter, which is about 10 times less in the former than in the latter. This means that running costs are 10 times less on FPGA than on GPU mining rigs for the same hashing power. The downside of FPGA it's the high **$/MHash/sec** coefficent, which means that you need to invest more money in a FPGA installation than in a GPU one for the same hashing power. 
BTW, the improved efficency means that FPGA can be used to mine with profit at difficulty-to-USD/BTC ratios that would make GPU mining at loss. It's the same that happened with CPU mining after every miner switched to GPUs.

Hi, I'm the developer of BitSafe. My distro lets you "skip" the first syncronization by downloading the blockchain from a web archive, and then reverts to the normal p2p syncronization. This is mainly used to reduce the time needed to get syncronized, but can also slightly reduce the storage space needed.

Why you're assuming they're going to grow in the first place? If the value of BTC will grow the average transaction fee will actually decrease. With larger use, however, it's safe to assume that the average block will contain many more transactions, thus increasing the number of fees the miners will collect.

"Practical" is relative, it really depends on the usage you'll put your wallet thru.
If it's a saving-only wallet, something you will put your BTC on and leave them there for some time, an offline wallet is probably the best solution. Use one of those opensource programs that build and prints the wallet without going thru a file.
If it's a big sum, low usage wallet that you'll use every now and then, then your best bet is a dedicated hardware with a not-windows OS. That, or a live linux build with some sort of persistence.
For low amount - frequent use wallets, a normal client with crypted private keys should be enough.

Using merkle roots it's possibile for a thin client to keep only the block headers (blkindex.dat) and discard the block data (blk0001.dat) and still be able to verify any transaction in the block chain without needing to trust a master node. It's written in the [satoshi's paper]( section 8.Simplified Payment Verification:


a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch
linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in

I can answer these
1) No, there's nothing you can do to get your coins back,  Bitcoin transactions are irreversible by design. That said, the cryptography behind it it's really solid and, provided that you follow some basic informatics safety rules, you can effectively protect your own money without relying on any third part.
2) the developers of the official client are in charge of fixing any fuckup that may arise. They can broadcast emergency messages over the network that get displayed by any bitcoin node in the world, telling them to suspend accepting bitcoins, to upgrade their client, to change something in their configuration and so on. Any change made by the devs must still be ratified by the majority of the miners in the network, you may think of this as a democracy controlled oligarchy. Up until now, this emergency system has been used two times, and in both these occasion has proved itself to be fast and secure.

In other words, out of 2^32 formally valid bitcoin address randomly taken from the 2^160 RIPEMD keyspace, checksum excluded, only 1 is generated by a "valid" (as wrote above) ECDSA keys, on average.
On top of that, there's the difference between a disclosed public key and an undisclosed one. In the former case, the attacker "only" has to compute the ECDSA public key generation to verify each private key candidate, while in the latter he also has to perform almost all the steps needed to get the bitcoin address out from the public key, basically a round of SHA-256 and one of RIPEMD-160.

That's it, with today I give up trying to explain americans that SI isn't like some kind of complex science theory, but a standard (and an easy one at that) that everyone in the world except for them use every day, and it will never get off if you keep telling yourself it's "too hard for the average Joe".
It's fine, just start using bits, bitcents, satoshis, coinette, whatever. It will just be yet another arbitrary unit that the rest of the world will pull up along with the normal, rational units. And that's because you guys are too much self absorbed to understand when it's time to stop to act like spoiled kids.

Or they're just statistical noise on a value that, as you'll know, is just a statistical projection?
the idea that the peaks are due to the hardware producers "testing out" the miner makes no sense. Do they switch all the miners on at the same time? Why? Have you ever seen someone testing a batch of hardware like this? And if they want to "mine the fuck out of the network" as you're suggesting, why are they switching them off right away? 
TL;DR: your comment makes no sense.

It doesn't work that way. Alice gets credit for only the lower-than-target hashes she founds, the pool doesn't know how many nonces/hashes Alice checked to find those, nor needs to.

Mining equipment efficency does not reduce bitcoin's carbon footprint. Actually, huge differentials in efficency like the one we are experiencing in the last months increase the carbon footprint because mining equipment becomes outdated fast and get replaced with high peace.
When the mining ASIC technology will finally set on par with current top semiconductor technology, bitcoin's carbon footprint will mostly depend on its price and the amount of bitcoins created in each block.

That would be a great news for bitcoin, but a terrible news for ASIC makers and owners. 
However, this would be relevant only if the SHA256 instruction was performed by hardware, because if it was microcoded it would be little more that useless. Frankly, I don't see why CPU makers should really add such a specific instruction to a general purpose processor: it's more likely for them to produce dedicated mining processors directly.

eBay would care big time.
Here in Italy it was common practice to pay for stuff won on eBay by ~~charging~~ depositing money on prepaid debid cards owned by sellers. eBay noticed it and explicitly forbade that method, going as far as to cancel auctions, removing powerseller status and even ban vendors solely on the presence of the word "Postepay", the most common debid card, in the auctions.

Birthday attack doesn't apply here: the addresses yielding a relevant collision don't increase as the calculation goes.  
Don't forget that, when you're searching for addresses collision, for each candidate you have to do a SHA256 and a RIPEMD160 round on top of the pubkey calculation, which is much more computationally expensive than mining.

If there are 25 block of which 5 are mines, the chances of not finding a mine on the first dig are 20/25. For the second dig they are 19/24. The combined chance of both being good digs are (20/25)x(19/24), or (20x19)/(25x24). Thus, the chances of digging all the good blocks are (20x19x18...3x2x1)/(25x24x23...8x7x6), or 5!20!/25!

If that's his proposal (keeping the name but changing its value) then no, you can't do that only by agreement alone. How would you know if you're speaking about "old" bitcoin or "new" bitcoins? A tx would change displayed amount if performed between client of different version... It would be a mayhem. You need to enforce that change on network level, multiplying the allowable generation bonus by 1000 and applying a factor of 1000 to every unspent output before a given height, and that implies to fork the chain.

Because the header alice has found a nonce for includes the hash of the block the pool is working on. Alice cannot change the block to, say, redirect the coin generation to one of her address, because that would change the block hash and thus the header. 
Moreover, alice doesn't even know the block she's working on: the miners only get headers to hash, the block is built and kept by the pool.

Proof of work: your miner sends back to the pool every nonce that generates a hash lower than a given target, which is much higher (read: simpler to find) than the actual difficulty target. The pool checks that the nonce is correct and awards you a share.

I answered this same question in the previous Moronic Monday. Here's my answer:
The algorythm that readjust the difficulty, otherwise known as retarget, is in [main.cpp]( function GetNextWorkRequired. I'll paste the most relevant part here:
        // Go back by what we want to be 14 days worth of blocks
        const CBlockIndex* pindexFirst = pindexLast;
        for (int i = 0; pindexFirst &amp;&amp; i &lt; nInterval-1; i++)
            pindexFirst = pindexFirst-&gt;pprev;
        assert(pindexFirst);
    
        // Limit adjustment step
        int64 nActualTimespan = pindexLast-&gt;GetBlockTime() - pindexFirst-&gt;GetBlockTime();
        LogPrintf(" nActualTimespan = %"PRI64d" before bounds
", nActualTimespan);
        if (nActualTimespan &lt; nTargetTimespan/4)
            nActualTimespan = nTargetTimespan/4;
        if (nActualTimespan &gt; nTargetTimespan*4)
            nActualTimespan = nTargetTimespan*4;
    
        // Retarget
        CBigNum bnNew;
        bnNew.SetCompact(pindexLast-&gt;nBits);
        bnNew *= nActualTimespan;
        bnNew /= nTargetTimespan;
    
        if (bnNew &gt; Params().ProofOfWorkLimit())
            bnNew = Params().ProofOfWorkLimit();
    
    
So what  it does is:
* Go back to the last block from the previous retarget
* Calculate the time passed between the last block and the one pointed in the previous step
* If the time passed is more than 4 times or less than 1/4 times the optimal (2 weeks), limit it.
* Calculate new target as the old target multiplied by the ratio between the actual time span and the optimal time span.

Well, that was a simplification. The keyspace itself is in fact 2^256. However the actual security level (the amount of entropy in a single private key, security wise) for ECDSA and ECC in general is, as today, about n/2, or 128 in our case. When speaking about brute force strenght, one should take the entropy level as keysize.

RIPEMD-160 it is not for signing but for hashing, and is used to get the bitcoin address out of an ECDSA 256 bit public key. You only need to crack RIPEMD if the address has never been used to spend any output, because if it was the public key would be publicly aviable in the blockchain. This is why it's good pratice to never reuse addresses.
Said that, ECDSA has a key expansion of 2, so a 256bit key accounts for "only" 128 bits of entropy. To put those numbers to scale, that's roughly the entropy in a 1600 bit RSA key.
