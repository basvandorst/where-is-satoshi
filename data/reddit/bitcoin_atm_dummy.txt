What is more convienient? What has been simplifed? If I have a Bitcoin wallet on my phone why would I need an ATM?

If there are more people wanting to buy BTC than to sell it, the price will be driven up because those shares are rarer and people will pay a higher price for them. On the other hand, if there are a lot of BTC shares for sale and no one is interested in buying them, the price will quickly fall.

So I walk up to a Bitcoin ATM, hold up my wallet's QR code to be scanned by the ATM, which would send my Bitcoin to the ATM vendor's account,  and I would get fiat currency dispensed from the machine?

You mean like someone putting in $40 and getting a printed BTC wallet from the machine that can then be used to make a purchase in Bitcoin elsewhere?

OK, but why wouldn't I just spend that $40 directly at the merchant? Until there are BTC-only merchants, I don't see the benefits.
And, by the way, I'm not trying to be difficult. I'm a huge BTC supporter and holder, but I can't grasp why we would ever need BTC ATMs scattered across the world's cities.

Vending machine... this might be the best answer I've received. Thank you!!!
Is this basically correct, Reddit? Or do Bitcoin ATMs do more than this?

I'm still unclear about what type of transaction I would execute. Withdraw BTC from my existing wallet? Put in cash and get BTC out?
