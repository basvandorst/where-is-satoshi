I was kind of hoping that schnorr signatures would work with old private keys as well, with some kind of automated key derivation in place. This way, you could move any kind of output using any kind of transaction, like old, new, segwit or schnorr. For now, people aren't willing to move their funds into a segwit address because it requires an extra tx.

I've got a brand new app [here](

One of them should give up and start implementing segwit at some point. They can't all be a monopoly, right?

I made a Lightning App, it will create a subdomain for 100 testnet satoshi:
Check it out.

I haven't found anything related to this on the issues page of the bitcoin github.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:00:33
Jeez, it's just an experiment with LN.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:33:05
If the miners have colluded and have significant hashing power, they can spam these transactions to artificially increase the fee. They don't  lose too much since they also earn the same fees that they spent. I might be wrong tho.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:08:51
There is no real app for ethereum tho. Not a single useful smart contract. Nothing. Just pump and dump scams.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:18:13
According to [this]( 133mb blocks could scale to 7 billion people doing 2 txs per day (open and close LN channels). I really hope you are not right.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:32:37
Schnorr signatures or anything that aggregates signatures is more important right now, AFAIK.
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:11:46
Add this as well: Single Funded Channels and micropayments.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:14:08
Will this allow for the dust addresses to move their outputs? I'm asking this because if the signature format changes too much, dust outputs will be able to move only after they transfer the money from an old kind of output to a new one, such as segwit or something else.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:22:11
the original satoshi client still works on bitcoin core main network, while the bitcoin cash client doesn't.
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:37:26
Does the payment provider support SegWit?
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:27:05
This is a nice gem, but it looks like [Blockchain made a payment channel solution called thunder]( which didn't take off because .. ?
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:36:01
Can we sponsor an implementation or donate towards development?

I was kind of hoping to be able to use a lightning wallet address without having a channel established.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:17:04
No, it doesn't. You still need to spend a whole transaction to:
  - move your money into a segwit address
  - open a lightning channel
  - settle a channel.
You cannot:
  - use LN without a channel
  - send and receive more money than the channel capacity
We need:
  - a modest block size increase
  - signature aggregation
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:41:23
My personal opinion is that we really really need a block size increase to at least 2MB, then focus on schnorr signatures and the move everyone on the lightning network.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:47:58
Yes, i'm aware everyone can be connected to a different HUB.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:46:44
Even so, it costs a full transaction fee to move your funds into a segwit address. Doubling the raw block size would make the spam attack that's currently running on bitcoin main net 4 times as expensive, and it would buy us some time.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:49:42
It costs a whole transaction to move your funds from regular to a segwit address. It doesn't help if you have many unspent outputs.
It costs a whole transaction to open a lightning channel.
It really looks like we need a block size increase. You can read more at this [very well written FAQ](
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:26:31
most of these balances are unable to move because of the current transaction fee.
segwit will not fix this, as you need to move the funds to a segwit address first, requiring a transaction.
lightning will not fix this, as you need a transaction to open a channel.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:35:40
Yes, this is correct. Lightning network is going to work pretty good for people who make a lot of transactions between themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:18:40
I was just reading [this paper]( which raises the same questions. There are a few tradeoffs.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:28:32
Maybe they can fit multiple payments into a single transaction and lower the cost per payment.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:36:42
except that it costs a whole transaction fee to:
- move your money into a new address
- move your money into a segwit address
- open a lightning network channel
What we need is signature aggregation, and a block size increase. Another cryptocurrency will take our place in the spotlight.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:37:57
I'm not. If a number of bitcoin users make a lot of transactions between themselves, lightning just "compresses" all their transactions into a few on-chain txs. Imagine a uber like app where people can earn btc by driving people around, and when they need a lift, they can pay with their own earned btc. It will be very difficult to convince people to put money into the lightning network if the fees are as high as they are now. We really need a block size increase.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:00:35
Can bitcoin ever scale to a planetary level?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:44:08
There's not enough block size to move a lot of people into LN, since LN is designed for a lot of small micropayments, and opening a channel costs a whole transaction. I've edited the OP, you might want to read that.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:35:43
This is probably not the case.. I know of other upgrades which will further decrease the tx size, but the block size will still be probably over 60-70 mb by then. I feel that we could pull it off this year, and bank the whole planet.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:22:31
how about the LN paper, which specifies [144Mb blocks for 7 billion people, 2txs per day etc](
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:14:53
People keep forgetting that LN scales transactions, not people. We need to work on scaling to 7 billion people as well.
Edit: i meant LN scales transactions between a small number of people. It doesn't scale the number of people at all.
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:58:28
My argument for the block size being too small is that we lost a lot of merchants, which theoretically means losing adoption. I know of the code upgrades that you mentioned, but until they were ready, we could have easily used a small block size increase. I am willing to sponsor a bitcoin developer with equipment, bandwidth and servers if that's what we need to go forward.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:05:02
Signature aggregation? MAST? A block size increase schedule?
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:22:55
That's 1 billion transactions. In almost 10 years, bitcoin barely had 300 million transactions. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:10:20
Even tho [LN needs a block size increase eventually](
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:09:47
What if the poorest people on the planet decide to join bitcoin LN at the same time? It doesn't matter if fees are low, they won't all fit in.
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:13:08
I'm probably very biased, because i live in a country where internet is very cheap and very fast. Most of the people i know use a lot of bandwidth monthly - i could download 200 GB in less than one hour. I could also buy a 1 TB drive once a month. This is the kind of demographic that bitcoin needs to attract, the cypherpunk people. If bitcoin skyrockets to real adoption (wages+daily spending) in just one or two countries in the world, everyone else will follow, regardless of the price, block size and internet speed - and this is enough to change the world. I'm kind of worried for the future of bitcoin, because of miner centralisation and the whole stupid block size debate. What will happen when we adopt signature aggregation, segwit and all the other optimisations but the mempool will fill up faster than it can clear?
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:55:24
What are your estimates, assuming the best case, where we get LN, channel factories, Schnorr (signature aggregation) and MAST. What would be a good block size to sustain 1 billion people doing 2 tx per day (open ln channel and close)? There has to be a block size increase at some point in the future. Bittorrent is eating up probably hundreds of petabytes of traffic per day and god knows how much hdd space.
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:38:19
This doesn't seem right. Bitcoin attracted a specific kind of people in 2010, when it started. The people who bought or mined in that period got kind of rich in 1-2-3 years, and most of them built businesses with their new money. They were incentivised to make new apps and businesses that revolved around crypto, because in this way, the amount they HODLed would increase in value. After the next surges in price, the same kind of people would use their new wealth to build miners, build energy parks, run full nodes, buy bandwidth and RAM and disk drives and drive more adoption. This is what i have been doing for the last few years. I'm sure we can increase the block size every year by a fixed percent (even 1%), as long as we follow up the most pessimistic technical progressions in computing. Everything is way cheaper than it was a few years ago (RAM, HDD, CPU, etc). Would 1kb be a good number for the block size? Would 10kb? What about 10Mb? Who here can say the right value? I can only say it's pretty obvious that 1Mb was too small. I'm also sure you can buy a 1 TB drive every month. If you can't, i'll send you the money (via bitcoin). Hell, i'll buy you a few servers around the world with enough bandwidth and storage.
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:53:33
I've been reading over here for years that if you don't own the private key, you don't own the bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:21:43
Lightning doesn't solve anything. You need to rebalance the channels and make sure they have a large enough size. Lightning only makes sense in a circular economy, which we don't even have, because we are losing adoption. Lightning isn't even ready. A slightly larger blocksize would have helped. When the time was right, a lot of people, including myself, started up full nodes everywhere in the world, to counteract the takeover attempt. Why are we fighting moore's law?
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:39:50
but it could do it, right?
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:31:56
So is the [LN whitepaper]( also creating idiotic expectations (page 53)? There is a limit towards how much tx data we can squeeze inside 1Mb. We'll have to start increasing the block size at some point.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:36:44
Why not, maybe we can bank the whole planet this year. Signature aggregation, LN and channel factories seem to be able to do it, in 2018.
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:33:20
You can't expect every human being to run a full bitcoin core node. You just need to make sure that there are enough people able to run full nodes in every country. We shouldn't downgrade bitcoin requirements to the lowest possible case, but to a median one. Why keep thinking about people who aren't already able to download 200 gb? You won't onboard them soon enough anyway. My point is, while we still have torrent sites and torrent users, which already use a LOT more bandwidth and hdd that bitcoin, we might as well scale into that direction.
