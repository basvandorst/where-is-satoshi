Jesus I'm jealous. I was foolish and tried to buy and sell. Only recently have I started truly hodling. May I ask how much you've accumulated over the years? 
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:41:47
I'm hodling either way, but still would like to know what those things mean
@_date: 2017-02-22 20:57:12
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:21:27
According to the media bitcoin is always crashing, so I guess hodling always applies. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:20:41
Recently started hodling for the first time in years after panic selling at around $350 (kicking myself) and have been hodling for about 3 months now and it feels gooooood. Will continue to hodl and I suggest anyone trying to play the market just hodl as well. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:48:08
Will be*
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:21:09
Very lucky. I made quite a bit of money off of mine and I got them 7 months after I ordered them. Really wish that went better than it did, but I guess I didn't lose anything. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:03:24
Nope. Always hodl. You can never know when it will go up/down for sure. Even if you think you're sure, you're still just guessing. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:54:30
Hodl no matter what. It'll go back up no matter how far it falls. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:09:34
We are hodling!!!
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:12:06
Or you could have bought them in 2011 when they were $5 a piece 
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:07:17
Thanks, I'll keep my eye out
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:54:13
I bet in a few months $900 won't seem overpriced. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:41:16
For real. Current trends make me want to buy more even at $900.
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:55:15
And it's back even stronger! HODL 
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:37:18
Just hit 900. Still climbing it seems. Everyone hodl on. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:33:03
Thanks. The quick response is appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:40:02
Won't need to. It'll go way up before 8 years. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:24:50
You do get karma for self posts. They changed that a few months back
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:03:06
What time do they usually start buying? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:11:39
As someone who was only involved in btc for a little bit a few years back, what exactly does this mean? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:07:50
"you guys" as if all of crypto is represented by a couple people who all agree on everything 
@_date: 2017-09-26 04:54:05
the heavier it is the more btc it has on it 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:14:44
Looks like it sent to a coinbase address and not a trezor one. The transaction address shows a 1 to begin with (coinbase address) but the trezor address starts with a 3. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:16:28
Is this what you need? I hope I'm not doing anything unsafe by posting this 
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:11:35
We're up 1k in the last month alone. Continuing with that trend we could easily see 10k in the next year. This is assuming bitcoin doesn't become even more mainstream by then. The reality of it is that we really are at a point where it could explode out of nowhere. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:37:19
I'm buying both. I'm sure it'll go back up, but never sure how far it'll fall! 
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:08:04
Oh Lord reekus please let this happen so I can buy a shit ton of discount coins 
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:48:26
Lol as much as I don't think this is true I really hope it does 
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:58:58
Man, you haven't been fired yet? How long are you going to post this shit for 
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:11:48
If you think btc isn't going to bounch back after this then you're crazy. Buying the dip right now is the best move. Not only will it help (even if only a small amount) to stabilize the price, but you'll also be making money when it goes back up. Look at every other "crash" in bitcoin history. Remember when it dropped below a dollar and everyone was like omg Bitcoin is dead 
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:50:40
He won't be a loser if he hodls though 
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:50:09
Filthy casual
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:47:55
Just a heads up, pretty sure this breaks one of reddit's core rules. I would delete it to avoid getting your account banned 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:07:50
There has to be a dip coming soon. It's been on a steady rise for over a month now without a major dip. I'd be surprised if we don't see one soon. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:51:37
I'm with you, but the reddit admins have a phobia of that kind of stuff because it can get them in trouble. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:50:23
I mean, he's still up a shit load 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:57:07
Seems fair we can talk about this because of how closely related to Bitcoin SegWit is. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:33:25
I'm no expert, but I think just continuing with the trend, and the likely hood of continued popularity increase. The better Bitcoin does for long periods of time, the more people get into it. The more people get into it, the higher the price goes. I don't know about 10k this year, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if we saw 2000 a coin by the end of the year. But again, just speculating. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:30:49
I've noticed a lot of people think coin and token are interchangable and they like token better, so they just use it generally when talking about crypto.
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:17:02
If you sell now you'll just end up having to buy when it keeps going up and never dips this low again. Hodl 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:47:36
Remind me when you're buying your coins back for $3500 because you thought there'd be a dip. Don't try to short the market. You can't predict that kind of thing. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:16:39
Just a healthy rise in interest. There doesn't have to be a clear cut reason. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:15:19
We already had the correction from around $2800. I doubt we'll see another one at this price. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:04:35
Until when buying things out in public they ask "cash, credit, or btc?" Then you're still an early adopter. Hodl on tight and don't let go. Most people, mathematically speaking, will not be able to own a whole coin. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 03:27:13
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:06:09
We're at an ATH. Everything before this has been a dip. In a month, this ATH will be the dip everyone should have bought at. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:50:53
Never sell, only buy more. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:09:58
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:16:17
It doesn't have to win. As long as but on succeeds, other cryptos will become more popular than they are now simply because people will become more interested in cryptos as a whole. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:51:13
It won't. Buy now. This will seem cheap at $5,000 in a few months. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:07:29
I fully plan to keep converting Fiat to btc all the way to the end. I don't plan to ever "cash out" to fiat. If btc really does reach $250k a coin in less than ten years, it's likely sellers will be btc compatible by then. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:00:47
As much as I like to joke about praising them for creating hodlers, it's really messed up that this happen EVERY time something major happens with the market. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:41:25
Think of it this way. No matter what you buy at you'll always end up with more of you hold. When it hits 10k you won't be too upset for buying at $3500 rather than $3000. You'll just be happy you bought at all. No one who has ever invested in Bitcoin and held the whole time has lost money right now. We are at an all time high. Expect to see more of those very soon. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:47:26
Coinbase needs to get their shit together or someone else is going to be the more accessable platform when coinbase inevitably fails during mass adoption. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:17:19
Nah don't sell, just buy more at the dip. It'll be up to 5k eventually. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:33:18
You're missing what I'm saying. In a month or two this price will look like a dip for whatever price we'll be at by then. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:12:40
My educated guess is that it's always a good time to buy Bitcoin, and the more hodlers we can create, the better the future of Bitcoin will be. At 10k a $500 drop won't even be thought of as anything close to a crash 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:57:17
Alright, if you check my post history you'll see I 100% believe in btcs future, but be careful. Personally I think there is no way it will ever drop below 2k again, but you need to be safe with this kind of thing. Invest what you can lose. Now if you are really willing to take that kind of risk, all power to you, I wish I was that ballsy, but for real man, really think it through. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:50:02
Nope. Never going below $2500 again. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:37:18
You'd need a crash for that to work. We just had one of those. This is the new price floor. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:43:12
Personally, I believe in litecoin as a crypto to go side by side with Bitcoin but for smaller purchases, but my main support goes to Bitcoin. I don't know enough about other coins to be able to say. However, as the person below me said, I think a lot of people buy altcoins because they want a "get rich quick" scheme instead of an actual currency. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:35:29
It's going to keep going up. Btc is basically on sale right now. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:09:22
Someone needs to make this into a gif 
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:26:50
If you really believe in Bitcoin the goal is not to sell, it is to use it as your money. You already sold when you bought btc. You sold your Fiat. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:15:43
Nope. After coinbase comes back online the price will have stabilized and people will realize they would have been screwed if they sold. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:00:23
I just like to be safe about this. I don't want anyone to take out a loan at 2k then have btc go down to 1k and have them panic sell and ruin themselves financially just to see it come back up to a new ATH a few months later 
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:22:50
Three years from now, this is totally reasonable. As soon as the scaling problem is fixed and the common person starts owning btc we'll see an enormous rush in the price. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:22:23
Why not hodl and in a month you can buy three
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:51:57
As a hodler the joy isn't in spending, it's in knowing that you will own more btc than almost everyone in the world when mass adoption happens. Hodl on tight. Of you had to have an addiction, I think something that helps you have financial security is one of the better ones. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:11:07
How many dips before 3k do you guys really think there will be? We're going to run right through 3k soon enough and you're all going to be kicking yourselves for [waiting to buy]( forever 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:36:34
Just hold. You never know when it will go up or down. But you do know that it'll keep increasing in the long-term 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:31:24
We've already been around $2800 with a dip to $1900. We've recovered from that. The next dip won't before a while. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:01:31
I'm not saying alt coins will be the most useful thing in the world, but people find a way of making trends out of everything and I could definitely see people trying to "get rich quick" like people who bought btc in early days. So for example, if btc starts booming and hits 25k a coin and ltc is at $200 a coin and etherium is at $1000 a coin, all those people flooding into btc are going to see those altcoins and thing wow look how cheap they are! So in my opinion, now is a great time to buy anything crypto. Always hodl. The crypto trend hasn't even begun yet. We're in for a wild ride. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:36:05
I don't think so. Probably breaking 3k with this push 
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:10:51
Awesome! I'm sure she'll enjoy it once that half a coin is worth 5k in August ;D
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:04:50
Just because you guess correctly once doesn't mean you're now some kind of clairvoyant. We could be at 5k by then and the "drop" could send us to 4k. Just hold. It'll pay off. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:25:45
Buy some now, buy some slightly after August 1st, and buy some at wherever you think the "bubble burst" lands, if we see that below the price we're at anyway. When it comes down to it, it's likely we'll see prices higher than we are at now, in the future. We can't know when it will fall, or rise. The best thing to do is buy whatever you can, whenever you can and trust that it'll be up in the end. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:46:43
One of the core concepts of making money in this kind of way is to never sell. You will NEVER be able to predict when the price will drop. No matter how hard you try. Take it from someone who sold at previous all time highs thinking the same thing, only to buy back at +$200 more when I realized there was not going to be a drop, essentially just losing myself money for no reason. The only reliable way to make more value for your btc is to hold them. You don't have to trust me, but God damn do the charts agree with me right now. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:39:45
Been fun? We're just getting started. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:42:45
As much as I would love to see this, I really doubt we'll ever see 2k again. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:36:03
This is horrible advice 
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:05:25
I think we just have different perspectives. If you believe 2700-2800 is a dip then yeah there probably will be a "dip"
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:49:02
I would buy one as well.
@_date: 2013-10-15 20:26:15
Thanks! Indeed I do! Just happy to have them haha 
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:43:50
Yup! It's actually an amazing system in that sense. I imagine when we get closer to 100k we'll start trading, buying, and selling in Sats. Bitcoin breaks down very, very, VERY far. I personally think we should be trading in mBTC right now, "millibits" so people feel like they haven't "missed out." The number one argument I get from people I know who want to get into Bitcoin is that they can't afford a whole coin. They don't realize they don't have to buy a full coin. Representing btc in smaller scales can fix that psychological problem we have right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:30:52
I've also heard of this toxic thing they called something like "*Dihydrogen Monoxide*" I hear it causes death if you breath it in. Even sometimes in small quantities! It's also the main cause of acid rain!
