Imagine that gold miners all of a sudden only found half as much gold. Initially this would hurt the gold miners profits because they would only be able to sell half as much. If demand stayed the same the price would have to rise to compensate this. Its basic supply and demand.

I agree, although the core is written in c++, it would be easier to learn a higher level language first. Once you learn the fundementals of programming in one language you will have an easier time learning another (harder) language. An example of this is: in php you have numbers, all numbers work the same. In c++ you have int, float, double, etc. They all are number but work differently, much more to learn before you can start  programming.

To add a little more context. Having an unlimited block size would allow people to spam the nework and make storing the block chain on personal computers impractical. Having a 1mb, as it is now, does not allow bitcoin to scale to a global level, it would only allow people willing to spend very high transaction fees to transact. 20mb block size is a happy medium of the two, however it hard forks bitcoin and is a unknown that people are afraid of. Their are many other solutions such as a dynamic blocks zero that would change depending on how full the last x amount of blocks were, similar to how the difficulty is set. Hope that answers your question, a better answer will require someone who understands the code better than I do. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 02:43:53
Many transactions will be off blockchain, from user to user on coinbase for instance. Scaling is not that big a problem. Stopping coinbase from keeping a fractional reserve is the problem.

1 btc = 1btc. The purchasing power or value of it is determined by what people think it's value is. The supply in circulation is just one part of what people take into consideration when they put a value on it.
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:28:50
I'm only having fun. The block size matters because if it is changed it will be a hard fork and potentially cause bitcoin to fail. This is the worst case scenario. If nothing is done, the amount of transactions will exceed the amount allowed in a 1mb block. This will cause another set of problems that has the potential to hurt bitcoin. There are pros and cons of both sides of this debate with no clear "best" solution. 
I'm in the camp that they should increase the block size, but either way I think bitcoin (or another crypto currency) will carry on just fine. Either way I'm not worried and enjoying this whole debate, it's history in the making. In the mean time I'm putting my sunglasses on sitting back and watching bitcoin go to da moon.
Tl;dr: no offense intended, I think there is nothing to be worried about, I think you should enjoy the ride.

Value is related to peoples opinion. 1btc is by definition 1btc. x = x. 
what you can buy with 1btc ( x = y ) will changed based on inflation and many other factors. As more btc gets mined, assuming that was the only factor involved, you are correct the price would go down. that is because the supply would exceed the demand. It is also possible that the 12.5 btc reward will not keep up with demand, in which case the price would go up. It is also possible that a flaw will be found in the code and people switch to another coin, in which case the supply will continue going up and the demand will drop, causing the price to drop.
To sum it up. $1 = $1, 1btc = 1btc. $1 or 1btc today might be not be valued the same as it will be tomorrow. Inflation is only one out of many factors that determine what the value is.
to quote your original comment: "...so 1btc does lose buying power until year 2140." is incorrect, it's supply will increase, but its buying power (value) has been going up consistently since it was created. in 2012 1btc was ~$5 currently it is ~$8700. I 'll bet you an upvote that this trend will continue. This is to the fact the the amount of demand (new adopters) will outpace the rate at witch it is mined(inflation).

Correct. X = X. When you want to value x to y, it is subject to any given persons opinion. People's opinions are based on many things. 
We use exchanges to gauge value because they tend to close to the average persons opinion, and it's the best method we have.

Gresham's Law applies to Bitcoin and all forms of money.
When offered the choice of buying something for $1 or $2, people will buy it for the better price of $1. The same applies to different forms of money. If you can buy something with either Bitcoin or with dollars, you will tend to spend the one you think is worth less (or the one that will be worth less in the future) and keep the one of greater value.
As this trend continues people will continue to get rid of dollars and hold onto Bitcoins, until the day comes when no one wants dollars and they will become worthless.

You can manipulate the market outside an ETF by buying or selling bitcoin. Which in turn would affect the ETF's price. The SEC doesn't like this because they can't always know who is buying and selling BTC.

Hold. It will replace our financial system and it will be extremely valuable one day. It may not be in the next 10 years but it will happen .003 will be one persons share of that value, if the 7 billion people on earth each had an equal share of 21million bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:26:36
I will add, that the reason I stated something so obvious is because eksander claimed that it would lose buying power as more btc are mined. That is not true necessarily. There are many factors that counteract inflation, such as if the amount of people that want Bitcoin outpace the rate at which they were mined.
@_date: 2014-09-06 01:10:07
That is one of the reasons bitcoin is so great. It brings up the debate about what is valuable. Does it need to be intrinsic(whatever that means). Does being able to pay taxes with it give it value, etc.

False, if the treasury printed money rather than the privately owned Federal Reserve there would be no national debt.
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:47:26
The money system we have today is based in debt. In short - for every dollar we print we owe back PLUS interest.  So even if we pay back every single dollar we will still be in debt. This system is 100% guaranteed to default. Bitcoin is not like this. When Bitcoin is created no debt is intrinsically tied to it. 
Yes, people can make loans with Bitcoin, and create debt. But the debt is not  an intrinsic property of bitcoin as it is with our current monetary system
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:49:00
Yes this is true, people will spend their dollars and for a time it will circulate better than Bitcoin, however this trend will only continue as long as people think USD has value. Eventually people will stop accepting it altogether and Bitcoin will rule the day because there will be nowhere to spend USD.
@_date: 2014-07-08 07:55:47
While I am against anyone that ignorantly attacks bitcoin. I think making a list of everyone that speaks out against it is wrong. We should focus on educating these people and getting them to change their opinions rather than shining a spotlight on them. There are enough groups out there (including government agencies) that make lists of people they don't like, and I'm not sure this type of thing is ever done for the "right"   reasons, what ever they may be. At the very least I don't see anything productive coming out of this. These are just my two bits, I will see my self out.

Lol. I think the idea would be fun, if only to see our tax funded government workers sweat a little. However, sending btc to their address would not fall anywhere under these regulations. The would need to be operating some form of business or performing some form of transaction for/with you. 
What you suggest would be like getting them to post their mailing address and getting everyone to mail them a bunch of nickels.
None the less, I like where your head is at. We need them to understand Bitcoin, and that regulations just hinder innovation and progress. We will know they understand when their regulations read as follows:
Bitcoin is legal and will be accepted for all government debts.

Bitcoin is NOT a currency.  Bitcoin is money. Currency is not money, but rather I.o.u's for money, and have little to no intrinsic value.  Slight difference, but an important one, I think. A difference Goldman Sachs is well aware of, seeing as they can loan out many more dollars than they can physical gold/silver.
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:10:15
I agree partially, however... using that same reasoning u.s. dollars have intrinsic value when you have to pay your taxes, or when your bill is due at a restaurant, or whenever you are trying to buy anything that the seller is only selling in dollars. Because you still need dollars if you are wanting to buy things only sold in dollars. Its the same as being stuck on an island, what do you need/value more at the moment.
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, it is only valuable because at the moment a large number of people trust in its ability to make transactions and store value. If someone were to find a loophole in the code, its value could drop to 0 overnight.  or it could be replaced by a superior crypto currency.

I agree, they cant regulate Bitcoin. Let me rephrase. Governments will regulate how people use Bitcoin. Similarly to how they regulate the speed limits on our roads. Those speed limits(regulations) don't actually regulate the laws of physics and our ability to drive cars faster than that speed limits, but the government will give you a speeding ticket if they catch you. They can't stop Bitcoin but they can put you in jail for the rest of your life if they catch you using it.

I think what they are saying is:  big players have a lot of money on exchanges and that is how they buy bitcoin normally. However when they want to place a huge order, they don't do it on an exchange because that would drive the price to the moon. So they make private deals with other people by taking down the bids they have on the exchange and using that money to buy bitcoin p2p. Less support/bids on an exchange means lower prices.

I think it will be great for big banks and businesses, probibly because they had a hand in writing it. It will cause the price to rise and give bitcoin main stream credibility. With that said, it will hurt bitcoin in the long run, or at least cause bitcoin startups to go outside of new york/usa.

To add to this. On an exchange people set up "buy" and "sell" orders for whatever price they want to buy or sell at. If people are buying, the sell orders get sold and the buy orders just sit there. And vice versa when people are selling. Exchanges usually have a second chart, other than the price, showing these buy and sell orders.
