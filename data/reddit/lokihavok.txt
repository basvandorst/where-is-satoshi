Every social system is vulnerable to corruption.
Some more than others. It's human nature.
Socialism puts more power in the hands of men.
Men who have legitimized their desire for plunder through unjust law.

AOL also introduced an astonishing amount of people to the Internet and it's fundamentals.
I don't particularly like Libra and prolly won't use it, but I think it will def boost adoption of crypto in general.

I guess it depends on which flavour of corruption you prefer.
I'd rather not starve to death because I've allowed the government handle my finances, for example.

It's the only thing I remember seeing that was similar.

Except, weed has like a much higher adoption ratio as opposed to BTC and crypto.

The same that could be said about most victimless "crimes". Most laws are just a way for the state to turn a buck. 
You know like the legal extortion that most people have to pay upon threat of prosecution and imprisonment. Taxes, I believe they're called.

Much worse. The evils of the FRS &amp; central banking in general

On paper perhaps.
But it must be beneficial or else why do it?
I mean between the money and assets seized by drug lords and petty traffickers alike and the benefits the state prolly gets in kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies and others whom have a staked interest in contraband remaining illegal there has to be some pretty big bucks involved. Qui bono. Amirite?
