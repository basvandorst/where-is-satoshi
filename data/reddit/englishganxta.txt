How did you come up with that when you don’t know the quantity at either 5 or 17k...?

You could figure out how to install and run LN but you couldn’t figure out how to install Jing?

Resistance can be created with the click of a button. It’s ridiculous to suggest “once it breaks 11750, it’s smooth sailing to 14000”

Really? Robinhood has a client base in the many millions. They’re more likely to adopt if they could just use their app rather than sign up for another account on another website.

It’s easier! You can use it today for stock trading. I believe ETF/Mutual Fund trading is on their roadmap too.

I think we all understand the point he is making. 
If a coin is valued at $500 for years and drops to $250, you see a $250 drop. 
If another coin is valued at $500 then jumps to $20000 then back down to $10000, you see a $10000 drop. 
While the math provided makes no sense, I think he’s just trying to point out that it is a lot more mentally taxing with the latter scenario on the surface.
—not that I agree with this logic at all but that’s just the point being made.

Yeah it has been like what... 5 mins? What gives? THE BUBBLE IS POPPING AHHHHHHH

I am actually way too scared to ask this question out loud.

A lot of folks are stuck on Coinbase and would have to pay the fee to leave. What are your suggestions?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:00:43
It's going all the way to 16k before hitting another wall
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:49:59
There was a huge wall to overcome at 13.6k. Smooth sailing ahead now that that's gone boys.

I've never seen so many cliche phrases crammed together in one post.
-- this is good advice :)

It seems natural to me that consumers would adopt the competitor in the case of lower fees. Why would anyone/new users sign up with a company that has substantially larger fees?
Darwin will sort this out.

There is a lot more to programming than tracing code.

You can store this information in browser cache/cookies - much better than requiring a login for the user.

So I went there today and it’s actually out of service :(((

We would have way bigger problems if this happened. The question would be "where did my nuclear weapons go?" not "where did my 0.005 BTC go?"

I agree and that is what a lot of people on this subreddit have been doing.
