It DID burst. We have lost 50% from the ATH. It is recovering though
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:33:02
This is exactly what I was thinking this week. The underlying value has not changed. It will recover
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:10:05
I have mad respect for people who sell at the right moment, its so hard. When I sell, it goes up immediatly. 
Im happy we’re finally rising again, I was thinking to liquidity a bit of BTC into alts for diversivication but not sure when and Im afraid ill do it at the wrong time.

A week ago I was 100% in bitcoin. I diversified and now only 40%, I couldnt be happier. Not only has ETH gotten me a good profit, holding 100% btc would have been quite a large loss
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:39:38
People keep saying that, but 40% down is massive already

Guys we have already recovered 15%, please don't sell at a loss. I am just sad that I had no money to buy the dip and that Bitstamp takes a while to credit my account :/

Imagine in Zimbabwe, one BTC approx 5.800.000 ZWD. WE RICH BOYZ!

I deposited extra cash on friday but it wont be credited until after christmas, I really wanted to buy now I think its a great time. 
Anyhow we cant do much about it, it could rise 20%, it could go down even lower (I dont think so we are now far away from the peak, ‘bubble’ has burst imo). We just dont know, all we can do it hodl!

Thats rough, keep strong buddy

Thanks for the reply, could you briefly explain how I move my BTC from an exchange to a wallet? Do I extract somewhere or something
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:38:05
I currently have some on an exchange, how can I move to a wallet, what are the steps I need to take?

Please consider diabetes funds, they are getting closer and closer to curing the chronic disease

0,25% fee is not bad right?
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:27:55
I must say I got nervous when a 35% gain changed to a -20% loss in a few days. But I hodled and now im in the green again. 
Im just sad that I had to cash to buy extra, exchange hasnt credited the account yet :/
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:08:27
Looks like we are going up again, so volatile lol, amazing. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:58:55
Did you see alts the past days bro?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:40:59
What is FUD?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:19:47
Actually I use SEPA, took less than a day, I was very surprised

Can someone explain me exactly what BCash is please?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:30:39
I call it lucky, and smart, and blessed!
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:37:47
Alright thanks
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:41:49
I bought at 15.2 but I split half BTC and half ETH. At 12.9 I sold my ETH and bought extra BTC, currently a little over break even. Happy with rhe decisions even when im late to the party
@_date: 2018-03-02 10:54:53
Free for ETH too!
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:28:32
It’s back
