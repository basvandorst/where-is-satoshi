That is the largest size right now, but I'll be adding more sizes soon. How big would you like it to be?
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:25:41
Great to hear!

I believe you will need the [Chirp]( app in order to read the seed number off of the audio stream.
Chirp is kinda magical if you haven't seen it before. It's like QR codes but with sound.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:16:53
For sure, I think that's the most general solution.
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:19:36
Gareth from Tinkercoin here, we charge $25 for $20 worth of Bitcoin at the current Bitstamp exchange rate. It's a flat fee for the ease-of-use that we offer. Hope that makes more sense!
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:23:09
I considered that, but decided that if people want to use the codes for something other than Bitcoin addresses, that's totally ok.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:21:19
I actually hadn't thought of that. Do you think there would be a lot of interest in contributing? What directions do you think the project could go?
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:21:14
It's not completely clear on the homepage, but you can only buy $20 worth of Bitcoin on Tinkercoin, and we charge a $5 flat fee for using the service. You're totally right, charging a 25% mark-up on a full bitcoin would be insane!
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:03:58
That's an interesting idea. We'll look you up if we decide to do it :)
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:59:18
Looks like a cool service! The US-based exchange market is in dire need of competition.
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:22:26
You're completely right. We have a great relationship with our credit card merchant account provider, which we've built over six months of working with them. Like any Bitcoin company, there's always a chance a decision from above could shut us down, and that would suck if it happens, but I don't think it's very likely.

They're very basic jquery animations, nothing fancy. Here's the [documentation]( on it.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:28:52
Tinkercoin only sells one amount of bitcoin: $25, and we charge a $5 flat fee on top of that. I know it might seem high, but hit the nail on the head for why that is. Over time, as the card processors come to understand Bitcoin better, we hope to be able to offer lower and lower fees.
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:22:07
Thanks a lot! That one is actually lovingly ripped-off from the [BBC's qr code]( I figured it would work with Bitcoin nicely.
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:16:23
Definitely, $5 on top of $20 feels much less steep that $200 on $600. We're changing our wording on the homepage to reflect that. Thanks for your feedback!
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:38:30
That's amazing, I'm glad you liked it!
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:15:59
Gareth from Tinkercoin here, you're completely right about the currency conversion limits. We've read Fintrac's regulations and the BSA front to back and have been aware of that from day one.
We also have a great relationship with our credit card merchant account provider, which we've built over six months of working with them (it wasn't easy sometimes). Like any Bitcoin company, there's always a chance a decision from above could shut us down, and that would suck if it happens, but I don't think it's very likely.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:23:46
Interesting, I'll throw that on the TODO list.
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:59:03
That's deliberate, it's necessary for the Bitcoin logo to not interfere with the data within the code. QR scanners can detect this without rotating the phone itself, so it doesn't make any difference to the user.
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:17:43
What do you mean the "transaction script"? I'm the original poster on r/netsec, I'd love to hear any other ideas you have about doing this safely.
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:16:08
Could you elaborate? I'm the op on that originally posted the question.
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:16:22
Thanks for the cross-post!
@_date: 2013-07-11 22:31:02
Agreed, we're writing a followup with more elaboration on how Public/Private Key cryptography works, and how you can be sure that other people can't spend your coins.
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:30:18
Sorry if I wasn't clear in the post, the Blockchain does record your balance implicitly, as the sum of the value of all the transactions to your address minus the sum of the value of all the transactions from your address. That's what I was trying to communicate.
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:03:20
Interesting stuff, we'll look into this for sure. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:02:51
Cool, thanks for the info!
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:17:01
This has to do with how Public/Private Key cryptography works, which I didn't talk about in depth in the post. The address in the blockchain is your "Public Key", but your "Private Key" is stored only on your computer, in your wallet program. Without your private key, no one can make your digital signature on a transaction, and thus cannot submit transactions to the network in your name. Does that make it more clear?

Can you tell he's Canadian?
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:15:33
Haha, my name is Gareth, I was the interviewee. I wish you were at the Halloween parties I went to this week, because I went as Sideshow Bob and no one understood my costume!
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:18:43
Could you point us to some of the others that have tried? I'm only aware of one.
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:55:48
Yeah, credit card fraud is one of the reasons this is so hard to do. We're confident we've solved it in a creative way.
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:05:08
What website did you run? I'd be curious to compare notes.
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:34:55
Oh that would have been genius. If I do this costume again that's definitely happening.
