sorry, meant to be light more sarcastic, not condescending. Just basing it off history.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:52:25
yeah thats another way to look at it! good luck!

i do understand how these exchanges operate and what they trade. Your comment history is filled with you calling people stupid and idiots. even on this thread you call everyone psychos and idiots.  i actually do agree with your points on a lot of your posts, just dont agree with bashing other peoples opinions and name calling.
my only point was it was somewhat humorous the CBOE price page crashed and that increased interest is a positive thing. 
Good luck! i hope you do well in this crypto world and make a lot of money!!!

no crash = good news, CBOE's Website Crashing = GREAT NEWS.  the mount of people interested is a very good sign.

anyone think its weird that the futures were set at 20k and they price is dropping to 19k

im split pretty evenly between ETH and BTC.  I was thinking of converting some of my ETH to BTC for this pump, but theres no reason ETH shouldnt get a pump as well i suppose
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:35:46
$16k 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:16:56
CBOE opened at $15000

nice call
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:51:32
i could, but theres literally hundreds of posts on here and thousands of recent news articles online about bitcoin futures launching today that would do a way better job than me.  you should just google bitcoin futures and start reading.

sleepy exchange? its the largest options exchange in the world. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:45:05
bitcoin futures started today. thats what everyone is talking about. Chicago Board Options Exchange
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:52:13
Any reason why i shouldnt load up on extra bitcoin right now before BCH goes live?  my guess is BTC goes up
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:42:15
ill assume you know the difference between options and futures.  either way, its not a sleepy exchange.  its significant.

balls of steel having a BCH buy order right now

i think their point is - enough people are interested in simply seeing the price that the site crashed due to all the traffic.  high interest is a good indicator.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:21:58
Can someone explain to me why anyone would have a buy order in for BCH right now?  i dont understand the logic
