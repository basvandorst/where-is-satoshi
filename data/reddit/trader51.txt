See what you just said? You bring up manipulation **only** when the price drops. Do you think that there was no manipulation in pushing and pumping the price up for the past six months? You could just go to the front page of this sub and blatantly see the pumping. 
Manipulation can never be proven, and thus it doesn’t make any sense to bring it up. And the fact that its **only** ever brought up when the price drops shows the bubble mentality of this sub

This shit is old as fuck. "2014"

It has increased in an almost super-exponential manner this year, why is it surprising to see a price drop?

Just look how downvoted my original post is lol

I don't know who you interact with, but you just have to look at the front page of this sub. It is a speculative bubble. People are in fear of missing out. People I know are just buying because they want to get rich...

Im getting downvoted because people dont want to hear the truth. Its not obvious to the people in this sub at all...
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:40:31
I understand what your saying, trust me. BUT, you just cannot ignore the fact that this fiat value of bitcoin is making people rich all over the world. My friend even bought a brand new Mustang with his bitcoin profits. 
The money is real and people are getting delusional from it. People are buying to get rich.

Increases "slightly" ? .....
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:36:08
Exactly. LIterally Just look at the front page of this sub.... The content is ridiculous. Makes me think how far bitcoin has deviated from its roots. Now its just a speculative bubble imo

Took my profits this morning. But just look how defensive this sub is. My post already has been downvoted to zero
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:47:12
This is exactly true. But if you say that, people will get defensive and angry, proving the bubble mentality.
