It's probably safe in that you will get the item you ordered. 
The risk is the investigation if it turns out the item was purchased with a stolen credit card. There have been a few cases of people SWATed as they track the item (now considered stolen goods).

Gemini might be fine. But let's say you deposit some coin to Gemini - they get combined with DrugDealerTarget's coin and the DEA agent tells Gemini to freeze your account for an investigation. 
Gemini itself may be fine, but you are still subject to government seizure, rightly or wrongly. Also could be a Gemini AML freeze, without any government involvement. 
Sure, you are innocent but why even take the risk? If you control your keys that CAN'T HAPPEN.

Yes. The code is open source, the device is just an easy-to-use safe for your bitcoin private keys. 
And the main concern with offline electronic storage like hard drives and USB sticks is device failure. If this happens with your trezor your coins are still 110% safe with the wordlist backup.
Probably the safest way to store bitcoin long-term. Just keep the wordlist in a very safe place.

You paid 120 satoshis/byte, which is normally a good transaction fee. However, the network is especially jammed right now and it takes ~160sats/byte to be included. 
That said, it is likely your will get in block in the next 8 hrs.

It doesn't exist. But there are several that accept bitcoin and will give you a wire or a debit card or a gift card or anything else....why is that?
Because credit/debit/giftcards/paypal are REVERSIBLE MONEY - the money can be clawed back up to 180 days in the future.
Bitcoin is NON-REVERSIBLE MONEY. Once it has sufficient bitcoin confirmations it can NEVER be clawed back, no matter the reason.
So, you are asking someone to give you NON-REVERSIBLE money for REVERSIBLE MONEY and take on the risk that their money will still be there in 180 days.
That's a huge risk.

Also reversible. Harder to reverse than credit/debit/paypal but still possible. Also wire transfer fees are high, so nobody bothers.
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:00:29
No. An off-chain transaction can just be a database entry at a gambling site or a trade on an exchange, and easily faked.
On-chain is the only real measurement until we get sidechains and lightning, which are more transparent than current off-chain bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:49:48
Yes. Yes. A valid-but-0-fee transaction likely will not be confirmed.
A valid transaction can also be replaced by another using the same inputs, called a doublespend - that 2nd transaction can be confirmed first. And in that case, the first valid transaction becomes invalid and will never make it into the blockchain.

Exactly. Also Op seems to think, "well, my login is safe, and they are experts so won't be hacked, and if they do they will cover it" - too bad that ignores other real threats:
1. Rogue employees
2. Government - this is probably the most important one. With one subpoena, the government can freeze all your money at the exchange. They can freeze ALL the funds, or just your account, even if it was a mistake or typo or dirty Fed (see Carl Force IV). Good luck in court getting it back or jumping through whatever hoops. 
Bottom line is if you don't control the privkey, you don't have ANY bitcoin. You have an IOU which can easily be broken sadly.

You can rebroadcast it once it has DROPPED from mempools. It is still there, just waiting. 
50 satoshis/byte just will not get it done these days. You may get confirmed during a lucky run of quick blocks, but overall it is unlikely.
You can try the ViaBTC tool here: 
If it does not go through, just resend with higher fee next time.
@_date: 2017-02-27 23:15:55
Yeah, it sucks. 
In the future for anything time-critical use a wallet that allows you to control the fees and check the current network average before sending.
That said, the network is getting a bit faster and you might be done within a couple hrs.
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:47:40
You can test it out. just close the client, copy in the wallet.dat file from the flash drive and restart the client.
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:19:09
50sats/byte is not a reasonable fee recently. Next time try 150sats/byte.

@_date: 2017-02-26 22:42:08
Well hopefully you have a strong passphrase on that wallet and it is encrypted properly. 
If so, you can hand out those flash drives on the street and your coins are safe.

Would require a fork and really the initial sync time is much better than it used to be - so not a major issue.
@_date: 2017-03-04 02:40:10
It's even worse than that. Satoshi is estimated to have 1.1-1.2 million coins. That's over 5% of total supply, ever.
If bill gates had 5% of the USD money supply he would have close to $1 TRILLION.
But satoshi deserves it.
@_date: 2017-03-01 00:36:59
While not a reversal - it is far from safe.
There have been MITM (man in the middle attacks) on bank account holders selling btc. Basically the scam goes like this:
1. Joe BTC Seller gives bank details to Frank to buy via cash Deposit. 
2. Frank scams someone else (Dave) to make a deposit for something else, e.g. via craigslist "I need $500 cash deposit for this apartment to be sure you are serious" - Dave thinks it's legit cause he has the name and bank account details.
3. Deposit is made, Joe sends btc to Frank. 
4. Dave complains to the bank who goes after Joe for scamming and reverses the deposit/closes the account.
So I would not exactly call cash deposit safe.

You have a long wait in front of you: that transaction paid 50satoshis/byte in fees, too low for the current network activity.

Yes, transaction  depends on transaction 
Transaction  is paying a tiny fee, 44satoshis/byte and will not confirm. Transaction  is higher at 120sats/byte but not enough to offset the very low fee of  to incentive the miners to mine both.

Yes they do it. Usually their pool payout are sent with 0 txn fee and included in their own blocks.
That said, by including these transactions, they are giving up OTHER fee paying transactions due to space limitations. So it's not really "free" - there is an opportunity cost.

I expect the "suspension" will be permanent. China wants assurances to no withdrawals are going overseas to prevent capital flight. 
Of course it's impossible to tell "where" a bitcoin address is - so there is no way to prevent this except to only allow Yuan withdrawals.
So these exchanges will basically turn into forex-brokers. People deposit Yuan and trade BTC, LTC, anything else. Profit or loss, they close positions and then withdraw in Yuan. That is the only way to comply with PBOC rules.

19 sats/byte is too low. Like 15x too low :(

Appreciate the response, I've sent some people your way but of course advised not large amounts (as I would for any service) - as I did not like Vorhees S2x handling, so I hope you guys crush them. Glad to hear nothing went wrong here!

Nope. It's sad that finex hasn't put something on their homepage and/or emailed customers. 
Now their price is $50 above Bitstamp, meaning people will overpay on finex just to withdraw and sell coins lower at Bitstamp to get their USD.
Just like Mtgox traded well above the other exchanges before they went under...

It's hard to trade reversible money (cc) for non-reversible money (bitcoin). Your "service" would be out of business quickly due to fraud. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:48:05
No, they require anal-probe levels of KYC to become a teller - so it is and will always be tiny compared to LBC.
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:15:40
It's been a scam for a long time. Use the search function for how they stole coins on various "bets"
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:29:46
Not unless you are willing to wait 180 days (the Paypal chargeback timeframe) before getting your bitcoin. 
Paypal is easily reversible hence the very high markup rates.
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:18:37
Who would you be selling to? Higher bids do not magically appear for you to sell into. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 19:20:17
Ok, then why does it take a month+ to get "approved"?? Skype interview? And it's disingenuous that you "don't verify any personal information" - when the person tries to deposit, you ask for ID/selfie. That's even worse, at least ask upfront. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 02:47:37
Then why is there an application form to be filled out and approved? Should just be anyone who downloads the app can make themselves "available" as a teller. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:06:55
Fine here too.
Keep in mind that if the trezor website went poof forever - your coins are completely safe. Can use another compatible wallet or restore from seed to many others. 
That's the point. It's just a secure private key that can be used anywhere.

Big news, Proshares is a very legit ETF company. 
Unfortunately, until the futures start trading on CBOE, this will never be approved. Hopefully that happens this year.

the best time to buy bitcoin was yesterday. the 2nd bet time is today.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:05:50
it's fee spam, costs them very little if they mine their own transactions.
plus, Bcash difficulty is low so they will mine/milk that for another 7 hrs or so, then switch back to btc. 
Also Antpool is mining small/empty blocks.
So, combination of those 3 things.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:50:19
try their slack, can expedite your ticket usually.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:11:59
That is not accurate. "gift" payments get reversed all the time - usually when someone claims their account has been hacked and paypal seems a different IP, etc.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:42:58
Even "friends and family" can be chargebacked thru paypal - just claim fraud/account hacked. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:03:04
paxful, localbitcoins.com 
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:25:22
Sure, do all those things. But keep in mind paypal frowns upon bitcoin and will probably not care about evidence.
But the most important is hold the bitcoin for 180 days, then send to the buyer. That is the chargeback/dispute period for Paypal and only after that are you really safe.

Trezor, with wordlist in a bank safe-deposit box or buried deep in your yard.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:30:09
uhh, you are paying 19sats/byte fee, which is tiny. It will not confirm anytime soon. You can try CPFP or an accelerator.
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:02:20
I also need a lot of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:48:39
Nothing is getting confirmed with that low of a fee. You are paying 120sats/byte, should be double that.
@_date: 2017-07-04 21:56:49
They have integrated Coinbase for bitcoin balances, and have used them for large wires to/from bitcoin exchanges with no problems.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:06:26
No, you can recover your coins using the seed words in multiple other wallets.
@_date: 2017-05-19 23:45:57
paxful.com or localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:41:37
Don't use blockchain ?
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:12:58
Everything electronic can be reversed (except bitcoin). So it's just a question of how much risk you want to take.
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:13:30
just the seed word list, which you should have written down when you set it up. No files.

Hardware wallet like a Trezor
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:29:40
Op got the address from his friend...either as a skype or IM or email or some method like that. The copy and paste to the wallet is what failed, yes, BUT he could have looked at the original source and compared it to his trezor - and caught the change.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:57:19
What webpage? You verify the address on the device, not the webpage. He was sending btc to a buddy, easy enough to verify the address via txt or skype or something.
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:46:53
Sure, for a transaction that size I wiuld have verified out of band - text message or something else. 
Yes, i know they can hack Verizon, the US Mail, Fedex, intercept a carrier pigeon, and obfuscate smoke signals.
The fact is proper security on a hardware wallet would help.

Sorry for your loss.
But I think it's a good thing the scam transaction gets confirmed. How does anyone know you are not a scammer trying to doublespend a legit payment?
If you can stop something in the mempool from being confirmed by just posting on reddit/twitter - that is a bad thing imo.
Expensive lesson, but so be it.
Edit: confirmed.
Edit2: get a trezor - and you verify the address on the device itself - no malware can break that.
