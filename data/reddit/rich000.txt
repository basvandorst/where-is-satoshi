Ever think of actually posting this on a Gentoo forum where somebody would notice?  
If you said this yesterday I'd have said that I wasn't aware of any packages implementing non-upstream blacklists.  Now I know of one.  
Things like this don't get fixed if people don't speak up about them.  No, you aren't going to find a million Gentoo developers reading this subreddit, probably just the one you have a dispute with in the first place.  :)

I don't see the actual ebuild anywhere.  Is your patch actually enabled by default?

I'd be shocked if that were true.  If you're just going to accept default-everything then Gentoo is just a Debian-like distro that breaks a lot more often.
I suspect that most Gentoo devs like to tweak their systems a fair bit, which is why they are running Gentoo.
Sabayon is probably more for the default-everything Gentoo crowd.

Gentoo generally tends to follow upstream, but it isn't a hard policy.
For example, the default openssh includes the hpn patchset, which is fairly large as I understand it and upstream has not merged it.  However, I believe many distros include it as well.
Not really taking a side here - just pointing out that it happens.

I agree.  The real solution to the problem of trivial transactions is to just require fees.  Then you "censor" anything that doesn't offer a fee from the blockchain, which includes nonsense like this stuff.

And how many of those previous times were reported to Gentoo?  As in following the policies for disputes?
There are hundreds of Gentoo maintainers.  It isn't like everybody reviews everything every one of them is doing.
As far as I'm aware there is no official policy regarding situations like this and we handle them case-by-case.

Logging a bug with the maintainer isn't going to get you an answer from "Gentoo" but an answer from the maintainer.
You'd do better to go to Gentoo QA or Community Relations to get a response at the distro level.
I doubt it is any different with any distro.  Bugs go to maintainers, and if you have a problem with a maintainer you have to see what the distro's escalation policy is.
Bitcoin isn't that popular a package that people will just take notice of this sort of thing.
