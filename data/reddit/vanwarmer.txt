I'm always envious of those who scoop some up on those long downward wicks, then within in an hour they can turn aroubnd and sell it for a profit. Earlier today it touched 9017. Now it's at 10400. That's a tidy profit.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:54:12
For all those who don't have it, or want more; potential buyers, which is what sustains the price or moves it up.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:55:30

Everybody is selling off. Let's face it. It went too high too fast. This is a BIG correction, not the end. The factors that drove BTC up in the past will still exist once this shitstorm is over. More so if it starts to work as a payment system again.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:32:49
yeah u should sell and buy back at a lower price when shit settles down
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:34:37
It doesn't matter how low it goes. If there's variability in the price there's money to be made.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:02:26
Because they are smart enough to take 20 percent profit when they can. Some of them probably made thousands in four hours. Would you HODL in that situation?

Can a LN channel be thought of as analogous to opening a bank account and depositing some funds? It seems similar, in that bank accounts create liquidity for financial institutions which they then use to move money around, collecting fees along the way. Similarly, could someone who is willing to open a channel on the LN collect micro fees when their node is utiliized?

Not if you aren't putting in more than you can afford to lose. A person could put a 1000 on an alt coin and make 100x returns.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:42:17
Eventually it will. Like when all the speculators go away lol
Anyway, I'm just trying to get at what bitcoin's true value is. The fundamental value is a function of what problems it solves. In developed countries it doesn't solve all that many problems for your average Josephine. But that's not the case everywhere. Also, I could see it or another crypto solving  a lot of problems for companies that do cross currency transactions with a lot of middle men, insecurity, an delays.

Do they cancel if price moves more than 20% in a day? I remember reading that somewheres . . .
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:31:19
It's dump and pump. When the price is up relative to a day or two earlier, everybody sells. Then the price plummets. A bottom forms where there is enough resistance to support the price. Then they start buying in big time to ride the forthcoming 10% increase. Rinse and repeat. It happens in bull and bear markets. The only difference is where the bottoms form. In the bull the bottoms form higher than the previous. In the bear they form lower.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:37:04

@_date: 2018-01-16 22:25:42
So noob question here. If I put in a stop order to sell at 10000, does that order help pull the price lower? I ask because I see a lot of support around 10100-10200 so I don't want to sell until I see if that support will break.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:46:50

You may be right but it's still WAAAAAAAAAY to early to know. This is a nascent market. Most people haven't heard of bitcoin. Most of those who have heard of it first heard of it back in November or December.
Plus, I gotta imagine that large enterprises are salivating at the thought of how blockchain could allow them lay off thousands of support staff, IT, and cyber security experts, close data centers, etc. Profit$!
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:30:23
How much of a return are you looking to get? Alt coins are relatively low risk, high potential return.

It will. Start again.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:27:16
It's not manipulation it's people buying low and selling high. Those who bought in the 9s and 10s sold today for 10 to 20 percent profit
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:40:10
In these countries, the local fiat is less stable than Bitcoin
You gotta imagine that, even though BTC is volatile, if you live in one of these places, it gives you a chance to minimize your losses and even make gains. A person could at least move their money back and forth between crypto and fiat to mitigate the loss of value.
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:58:12

The internet bubble didn't pop. The DOT COM bubble popped. The internet is still here and bigger than ever.
I was there too when the dot com bubble popped. I didn't lose money. Some friends and I had a company that basically sold shovels to all the startups digging for venture capital gold. I remember the day when three clients called and asked us to take the ".com" off their marketing materials. All of a sudden being a "dot com" was bad. It was the beginning of the end.
There's some BIG differences between the dot com bubble and cryptocurrency "bubble." Yes, crypto has been overhyped for the past couple of months. Yes, this correction was due. But that's pretty much where the comparison ends. 
Your anecdote is interesting but the analogy isn't accurate. 
Crypto is not a dot com. Crypto IS the internet. And it's gonna be UUUUUGE! (But it might be a while, and there will be many winners and losers along the way).

News agencies like to be on the correct side of events, so they purposely publish FUD when the market is going down, and publish positive news when the market is going up. They have all these articles written already and wait for the right time to publish. Sometimes the news leads the price but more often it's the other way around.

@_date: 2018-01-16 21:51:43
It won't go to zero. Everybody knows that the lower it goes, the higher the possible returns. Everyone has seen it go to 20,000 and they know it's technically capable of surpassing it. So at 7000 there's the possibility of 3x returns.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:09:54
There's a huge difference between those prices and the ATH of 20000. Consider this. The crypto market may get as large as 4 or 5 trillion. That's about 10x what it is today. So I might reasonably expect btc to get to 100000 after several years in a best case scenario. Those are great returns but at my level of investment it's not enough to make me rich. So hodling makes no sense for me. On the other hand if I ride the waves, buying low and selling high, I can make more than. Hodling is not the best investment strategy for everyone.

From what I understand, it's ETH without the frlls that can cause security and scaling problems with ETH dapps. Its ETH for enterprise. So you can't run a crypto kitties on Stellar but you can do a million things businesses would want to do. But of course this is my layman's understanding and everyone should do their own research. I have invested in Stellar an amount i can live with losing. Basically my philosophy is "I can stand to lose n but I can't stand to miss out on n times 100." I was in tech in San Francisco and Silicon valley during the early days of the internet. I had money to invest but instead I spent it on art and vespas and living large. Kind of regret it although good times were had. Crypto now is my second chance so I'm throwing some money at the wall to see what sticks.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:40:05
Ah I didn't get that in your analogy. You may be right but I'm not convinced, yet. A lot will depend on if Lightning Network makes it viable as a payment system. Bitcoin still has the advantage of having the most users. From what I understand, the "network effect" advantage is huge. It's also the most "mainstream" being on exchanges and all. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:54:59

You'll have a chance to buy it back lower or close to where you sold it. It always revisits recent lows. You can set a limit order to scoop some up when it's near 10k again if you want.

Those who bought between 9-10 are selling for profit. Plus bearish sentiment overall. Looking at the charts going back to the all time high, BTC has made three new lows.

Ask yourself, what caused BTC to go up to 20k? The answer is "hype." The answer is "BTC went up because bitcoin was going up." Everybody jumped on the bandwagon. But there was nothing fundamental to support that price. The price has to get back to a place where it is supported by some fundamental underlying factors, like adoption as a currency.

Gotta read between the lines man.  "considering a law" doesn't mean jack in a democracy.

@_date: 2018-01-24 20:30:46
My point is no amount of good news or hype can counter what the chart says.
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:40:42
On Jan 7 BTC was at 17,000 and the crypto market cap was in the 800 billions (the highest it's ever been and this was Post BTC ATH!) If the market had gone over 1 trillion the narrative would have been massively bullish and we would have possibly seen 1.5 within weeks. IMO world leaders were getting nervous. They know they can't stop crypto but they can slow it down. When BTC corrected down to 13500 five days later then started back up again, world leaders made their move. South Korea announced a possible ban and made a big show of raiding exchanges. China made noise about "cracking down harder." IMO, these events were timed to prevent another run-up of the crypto market. Take this with a grain of salt bc I am susceptible to conspiracy theories after 4:20 in the afternoon.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:48:45
We all know that in the end Bitcoin will be a story of triumph, not tragedy. This is the end of Act II. Act III begins soon.

I have heard or read somewhere that HODLing is bad for the BTC ecosystem bc it cuts down on liquidity. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:55:57
Same here. It seems like lower priced alts are better for holding because the potential for bigger returns. I can't imagine bitcoin going up 5 or 10 times what it is now. If it drops to 5000 or so then different story.

This is total FUD! China announced a ban back in October and the effect on price was short-lived. Now they are saying they are going to enforce the ban a little better. Who cares?
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:58:27
Yes it is: use cases; problems it solves; adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:45:21
Ditto this.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:03:11
What makes this chart more accurate now than in the past is that the popular narrative of bitcoin now fits the chart. Previously, when BTC would spike and then plummet, there was still a relatively small awareness of it. Now, the world is watching, and saying, "Yep looks like a bubble to me." 
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:39:32
What is it then?
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:21:29
Yeah plus they are just introducing a bill to ban Bitcoin to congress. It would still spend time in committee and have to be voted on at some point down the road IF it makes it out of committee. It's just like the US. There's a LOOOONG road between introducing a bill and making it a law. Most bills never make it. Many are introduced just to score political points or send a message. That's what this one is. They know they can't ban bitcoin but they want to send a message for everybody to cool it a bit. Also, I'm sure many SK politicians had their fingers on the BUY button when the price dropped.

 Right now I'm waiting on some BTC to arrive at GDAX. There's a total of 87.64282515 BTC in the block. I wonder if a wave of sells will happen when a block gets confirmed and the funds become available to sell on a BTC -&gt; Fiat exchange.

LOL the 24 hr percent change of +11 is skewed positive right now (2:30 PM PST) because 24 hours ago it was in the 9's for a short time then went back up. In one hour or less it will be about +2% green.

Interesting. Thanks for the tip. I wonder if SK exchanges will be required to pair everything with ICX.... to prevent Won flowing out of the country.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:24:18
I love BTC and everything it stands for and everything it can be. But I think it's too high right now. I mean, if you take the entire price history, say the total number of days and then take the number of  days that it's been over 10k. That's a ratio of about 3230/51. It's been over 10k for 51 of 3280 days. That's 1.5% of it's life. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:54:14
It's empirically proven that my age will continue to rise (until I die of a heart attack from too many cheetos)
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:29:29
Yeah. My rough estimate is "the price before the hype plus whatever meaningful adoption gains have been made in the interim"
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:27:19

@_date: 2018-01-31 03:29:08
True but the lower it goes the more people who have none will think damn I could make some pretty good returns if/when it goes back up. The lower price is less of a psychological barrier too.

Bitcoin's target market...?
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:58:56
When you look at the chart for an alt coin that has been pumped and dumped it usually has a rapidly occurring high, then a drop, then a second run up that doesn't go quite as high as the first, then a gradual downward trajectory until, if the coin has any value at all and isn't just a shitcoin, it levels off somewhere above the point where the pump and dump started. This higher leveling off could be attributed to higher awareness of the coin brought about by the meteoric rise. Looking at the BTC chart back to November or so it looks the same, like BTC has been pumped and dumped. My casual non expert prediction is that BTC will level off in the 8-10k range then slowly grow, with spikes up or down based on positive or negative events.
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:24:16
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:19:10
Not all the people in those countries are poor. Also, bitcoin fees have only been high for the last few months or so. Lastly, correct me if in wrong, you can set your own fee.

@_date: 2018-01-22 21:53:26
Beyond TA, where is the fundamental, use-case support? Is that even a question that can be answered? I mean, there's got to be some fundamental support from third world adopters whose local fiat is more unstable than BTC. Then there ar the die-hard hodlers... Anybody else? The Winklevi?

@_date: 2018-01-22 21:37:19
IMO this drop won't stop until the popular narrative changes. Right now it's all about the decline from the ATH. It's going to be awhile before that story can change. A long while. I mean, it has to go down to a price that is supported by adoption and other fundamentals. Then it has to level out for a while so everybody forgets about it. It has to become boring. Then it will need a chance to grow based on the fundamentals again. Then the press will be like "Guess what asset grew 400% this year? Remember Bitcoin?"

Candles represent a period of time (1 minute, 1 hour, 6 hours, 1 day, etc.). A red candle means the price finished lower than it started during that time frame. A green candle means the price finished higher than it started the time period. The "wicks" show that the price went higher or lower than the open or close, but didn't stay there. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:09:50
Maybe it's just an innocent case of pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:42:52
The downside of storing on CB instead of GDAX is that you can't set STOP sell orders on CB. I have STOP SELL orders on all my coins so that if the bottom falls out everything will sell at a price that will recoup my original investment plus a little gravy. It's practically risk free that way.

BTC has the longest reputation for security. Lightning network will improve it as a currency bigly. It has the most exposure to big investors. It is the biggest household name. It has the lead in network effect (a network with 9 users is more valuable than two networks with 5 and 4 users each.) So yep I think BTC will remain king.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:55:20

@_date: 2018-02-03 19:56:26
I tend to agree. My reasoning is that, given recent events, we are likely to see more short term profit taking and less hodling. A lot of people got burned. The irrational exuberance has turned to cautious optimism at best. The market is volatile. The underlying value of the asset is questionable. Until wide spread use as a currency becomes more prevalent, staying in long term doesn't make sense, unless the entry price is steeply discounted.

I agree. The mood has shifted. Washington has said that crypto is has the potential to be a huge market, and they aren't going to stifle it. And the  sub 6000 low we hit yesterday is psychologically important. It may dip down there again but I don't see it staying that low for long.
