It probably had more to do with the price shooting up to $9500 despite that sell wall.
Me'thinks somebody's poorly crafted bot went on a buying spree, thinking it was getting really cheap BTC rather than BCH. Whales need to keep those bot's API calls up to date.

Gridcoin has a couple challenges with it's method of mining it uses. On paper they sound great but the logistics are hard to get right:
1. Mining actual does nothing to secure network transactions. Mining merely determines how new coins are distributed. Gridcoin relies on a secondary Proof of Stake system to 'mine' (actually stake) blocks. A holders chance to stake comes from the coin age of the coins they hold in thier wallet as compared to everyone elses. The more and older the coins in your wallet, the more likely you are to stake. Once you stake, coin age goes back to zero.
2. The mining mechanism is very centralized and this presents it's own challenges. Mining results are determined by centralized statistics gathering about once a day. Each project reports to a centralized statistics server how much work an individual contributed to a given project. Each project is given the same allotment of coins to distribute to all workers. Projects with smaller amount of workers end up preferred as the payout is bigger. The way these results get into the blockchain is that a 'super block' with all of these results gets staked about once every 24 hours; each node gets a copy of these centralized results and trys to stake it into a block. The superblock's validity is determined by the 'neral network' which is a voting mechanism between all nodes that compare it's answers for the proposed superblock against it's own.  
So what can go wrong? 
If the neral network can't reach a majority, the superblock results are thrown out and coins are paid out on the previous schedule until a new superblock comes out. 
If a project fails to report to the centralized statistics gathing no coins are award for project for that period. All other project's coin allotments are increased by the missing project's amount. 
Even after a superblock comes out each miner still needs to stake a block to receive a payout. To stake a block, you need coins in your wallet for Proof of Stake to work, thus a new miner must pool mine until they have enough coins to stake.
Gridcoin is trying to improve upon many of these issues, but I'm not involved enough to tell you what the approaches are.

I think you mean the floor is made out of buyers. Just hodling a Bitcoin does fuck-all for the price.

And the price of bitcoin has doubled since August too. 
Essentially, this means that your mining equipment from August is just as profitable today.

I'd be more concerned that someone would use this to recalculate large swaths of the block chain and call the validity of the ledger into question.

The running of nodes is the only aspect of bitcoin that requires altruistic behavior and it's the one aspect that's hurting. 
Greed is a powerful modivator and I think the solution lies in directly monitarizing the running of nodes. The number of nodes would greatly grow if it were possible to turn a profit (or break even on operating cost) running said node. Heck, even getting a couple of bits to serve out blocks of old data would be something.
How would you go about doing that? Perhaps something like giving out rewards based on number of blocks served per time period split by the pool of full nodes. A lot of work would needed by the devs to ensure that this system couldn't be gamed. The second and more tricky bit would be determining where the reward is coming from. As there's no revenue source currently implemented with full nodes, there's no where to pull money from.

And the reason for this is everyone with bitcoin on cryptsy is doing the same thing. There's a glut of (imaginary) bitcoins forcing price down and a artificial scarcity of the remaining alts, driving price up.
One of the lessons here (other than don't keeps coins or cash on an exchange you cant afford to loose) is it pays to look at the pricing of bitcoin across many exchanges. If an exchange shows a consistent discrepancy, you can bet something fishy is going on. Prices that are too good to be true often are just that.
Personally, I use the tabtrader on Android to do a quick price sanity check across several exchanges. You might find it useful.

So every sidechain coin becomes a bitcoin tumbler of sorts. 
Step 1. Steal bitcoins
Step 2. Convert to sidecoins from dirty wallet.
Step 3. Convert back to bitcoins into clean wallet(s).
Step 4. Profit!

FYI. Fireproof is only good for storage of paper (300 degrees F max temp). That's okay if you've writen your wallet down. 
If you want to keep USB sticks and hard drives happy you need a fire safe that's rated for digital media (125 degrees F max temp).
Edit: F for C. Derp.

A blowjob. You can beat an egg and you can beat your spouse, but you can't beat a blowjob.

So cool this thing might be pretty secure, but my next worry would then become one of reliability and stupid human chance.
If this sucker dies because the battery leaks, or the caps dry out in 5 years, or you walk across the rug on a dry day and zap it, or it gets run through the washing machine.... *poof* go the bitcoins. I only see this being good for day to day small transactions. I can't see risking putting $1000s on it. Not that you should ever put all of your eggs in one basket.

And the government has bigger and better weapons than the people do. 
The government can defend it's currancy. It's up to us to defend ours.
If the two clash well, it should be interesting to say the very least.

So can i assume this thing reuses the same private key for all unused inputs in a transaction and doesn't generate new addresses to aid in protecting anomintity?

I'll probably get down voted to hell for pointing this out, but here goes.
This is one of the pitfalls with current implementation of bitcoin. Only so many transactions can fit into a 1mb block, as such the are prioritied by the miners. Large value transactions and transactions that include larger transaction fees get priority.
What you're seeing here is we have a high volume of trades taking place, so the network is getting bogged down. 
Sooner or later this high volume will become the norm and the only way to push transactions through will be by including fees, effectively out bidding the other transactions. Say bye-bye to one of the big advantages bitcoin has over credit cards and the like (low or no transaction fees).

The spammer must be burning a lot in tx fees, because he didn't spam cheap transactions, but rather 'spammed' all across the fee range. 
He's so sneaky making it look like organic growth and fee competion. /s

Does gold suddenly become untradable once the market hits capacity?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:44:26
Oh noes! You cant throw a trillionty transactions in a block! We better completely cripple the network and halt all further adoption by hodling fast to our ludicrously small block size, that is no where near what the current max on-chain scaling can support, and wait for our vaporware second-layer network to appear. Yeah... That's a great plan.
Or, you know, you could increase the block size, allow adoption and network value to continue to grow, and put the second layer system in place when it's ready to go live?

Are you guys still using your free AOL CD-ROM dial-up accounts from the 90s to support the Bitcoin network? 
It sure feels that way when you guys talk about how any block larger than 1 megabyte will cause centralization.

Yup. And you can watch that tiny fraction become valueless when transaction fees exceed it's value.

Hashcat puts the Nvidia 1070 at 30 MH/s (3*10^7 H/s).
The current network hashpower is 5,428,065,120 GH/s or 5.4*10^18 H/s, over 11 orders of magnitude bigger than the 1070 hash power.
In comparison this is the volume difference between a single drop and a Olympic swimming pool. So not quiet as bad as a drop in the ocean, but not great either.

It's not a ban until they suspend mining. Then we'll see a world of shit.

Could it be that most Chinese mining is being subsidized by the government, so there's little care if the actual reward has changed?
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:58:11
That sounds too much like a "too big to fail" viewpoint.
But where is all of this hashing power coming from? It coming from asic chips fabbed out of China. All it would require is running the fabs out a little longer and holding onto the product. A motivated government could do this if they so wished.
It's the next arms race :)
