Never listen to anyone online about this stuff.  
if you have bitcoin and want to sell, its in your interest to pump the price with false optimism  
if you want to buy some up cheap, spray some FUD around  
  
while i hope Bitcoin can change the world, at the moment everyone is after profits. even if it is just to hodl more later on

is it possible only part of your order completed?  
To be honest there's not much someone on reddit can do to help - I'd suggest contacting the exchanges support as the price hasn't changed THAT much

Yeah this seems to be a monero miner, similar to the one piratebay has been using.  
  
I'm having a dig now this looks interesting - is this from an up-to-date version of the extension?
EDIT: can't seem to find anything malicious, I'm fairly sure the miner is the only hidden treasure here. if this is on the chrome store i'd report to google ASAP

unless i'm missing something theres no pool info.  
  
what he's probably done is set it up so the websocket connection is a proxy to a server of his that does have that info
  
still unsure what the array of 8-bit ints is but i'm having a play
