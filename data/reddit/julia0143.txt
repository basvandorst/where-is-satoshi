Well, heya, neighbor/visitor.
Yeah, I was the passenger in the car I took the pic from, and had kind of been zoning out. The "Bryan Dairy" intersection is the next major intersection north of this one, thus my mixing them up (we were southbound, and I hate getting stuck at each of these).
This is pretty close to the borders of Largo, Clearwater, Pinellas Park, and St. Pete. From my home, I drive roughly one mile, and I can be in any of those areas. I was merely guesstimating that this was in St. Pete.

Mom, I don't recall the part in which I tried to pitch you a car. But now that you mention it, I have a fine piece of auto-machinery for sale, one that coincidentally fits right on into your budget. The gas mileage is great, the windshield wipers have just been replaced, and the overall look is distinct enough that you'll never have to worry about misplacing it in a supermarket parking lot. For a mere $12,999, you could be behind the wheel of [this baby]( within the week. PM me your details. Let's do this thing.

Ha! And, yup, FL. St. Petersburg... ~~Bryan Dairy~~ and 66th st. N., to be exact.
We were stopped at a light and I didn't notice the plate until we got the green. The guy peeled on out of there, zig-zagging around the other cars once the lights changed.
**EDIT:** My bad. It was Park Blvd. and 66th. I only managed two snapshots before the traffic was moving again; [here's the first](

Well, if you have a few sitting around just collecting dust, I'll take one.
