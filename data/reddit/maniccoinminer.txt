Here's my guess: $228.46

Thanks. Any available right now you'd recommend?

 - This may or may not have anything to do with the downtime.

Thanks for the reply, yes I have email notifications set up and its great to hear Push Notifications is an Open Ticket. This will be fantastic once enabled as I don't always see the email come in.

See my reply above, 
Personally, I see a value in spending Bitcoins as a way of promotion whilst also keeping some back on the hope people see them as a valuable assets when spending them becomes the norm.

Thanks - We all love free Bitcoins.
It's great to see companies looking at was to support Bitcoin and a lunch an alternative service.
What is your one USP, the one thing that would make a user choose your service over a more established one?
If I were to buy in GBP and sell my Bitcoins in USD, what currency can I withdraw my funds back to my bank account?
Do you plan on having a Woocommerce Plugin available?
And finally, can a merchant using your API select to receive BTC or Fiat?
Good luck with all you hope to achieve!

CoPay is great, my only issue is the fact you don't get an iOS notification when another signature on the wallet requests a withdrawal (or any other action).

Thanks for the recommendation. 
Do you know of any others so I can compare?

7 machines in a location that big? Surely the rent costs a fortune, so even with free Miners, Free Power and Free Internet you are at a loss before you even turn up for the day. That set-up fits in a half rack cabinet. Am I missing something?

Maybe I should have started the thread later in the day (I know I was up very early today).
Thanks for being up for it, lets generate some interest and get this sorted.
Did you want to name a day/time so I can repost an 'up and coming AMA' ?

I have done and my first application was declined without reason so I thought I would ask others that may have been in the same situation for guidance.
From your comment I guess you can not help and have not been in this situation.

Thanks for the links.  I guess I was looking at it from a slightly different angle. If everyone hid their coins, no transactions would take place. People are impatient and want thing right now. If no coins were available on the open market then people would simply look elsewhere. As a result, people would either fall back to what they know, like dollars or find an easier to access coin. I guess that comes back to the supply and demand model. Someone, somewhere would always cash out if they deemed the price on offer to be acceptable, thus keeping the coins in circulation at whatever value.
