Ok. If the app is as good as it looks from the screenshots, i'll purchase a licence to support you. Would of loved to get it through the appstore though.

Sounds like bs

Agree with you but it has to be money you are able to lose. If I'm buying BTC with next month's rent, losing it is going to hurt. If I'm betting 50% of my saving which is in a bank doing jack shit then losing that is going to sting but not much IMO. 
I bought BTC with the money I can afford to lose. If I lose it I will be a very upset. But if I didn't buy it and Mr McAfee is right, I'd be heck of a lot more upset.

I'm new to crypto and even newer to r/Bitcoin and this type of comment already pisses me off

When will it be available on the AppStore?

It's super hard for me to choose a moon price I'd be willing to sell for. I'm invested into btc on the off chance it will **really** change my lifestyle e.g. retirement at 35 kind of thing (7 years to go). I already own my own house (have a mortgage but it's a comfortable one), car etc.. I guess there's an aspect of greed to it, and I'm **very** greedy :(

Any tutorials for doing that? I signed up but not really sure what to do. I’m guessing I need to give them all my information in the set-up stage to do this?

I’m pretty much the opposite, luckily. I bought 1.5 btc around the 10k usd mark around new year time I don’t remember when exactly. Been in red ever since but I just deleted my tracking app and was happier ever since. I come here and read the daily chat thread sometimes to get an idea of how the markets going but I literally never go and check the price. I really recommend learning to not give a shit, it’s great.

I’m also with nationwide (because my mortgage is). Fuck nationwide. I don’t know how to deposit with nationwide, but why not open a Revolut or Monzo account. Deposit to that and then to Coinbase. I prefer monzo myself but opening a revolut account was instant if I remember right.

Great, thanks for taking the time to write that out. I will need to find out if my employer would be willing to do this.

You’re right that is a problem. I haven’t got enough balls to sell though even if it mooned. I’m hoping having &gt; 1 btc in the future will be very rare so I want to be in that group anyway
