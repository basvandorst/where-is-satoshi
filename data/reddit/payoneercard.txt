I looked at the Buy Now button before but it creates a separate button for each item. But I just read that page again and found where it says "Multiple items can be combined into one order." 
So maybe it that is exactly what I'm looking for. Thanks.

Thanks. I did find that page before but there are so many different solutions available that I wasn't sure which one was best for my situation. The part about Pre-generating Bitcoin addresses might just work so I'll give that a try.

Okay, this is the part where I get lost because you're talking about bitcoin terms that I know nothing about. But I'm going to dive into it and I'll save your comment for when the time comes. Thanks for your help.

By not a business I meant I'm not incorporated. What you described seems to be the best option for me but I can't find anywhere how to "handle what goes where". Are there any good resources online?

I'm considering moving to paid hosting if there's really no other option but I was surprised there wasn't. 
In my case sending the buyer an email with a bitcoin address after they ordered would be a better option, but I couldn't find any good resources that explains how to set that up (I think I need a wallet first?). And the few resources I did find warn that it's not secure, something about double spending. Where can I learn how to send out my address securely?

I already had users submitting their information covered simply by using an order form and passing the parameters to a confirmation page. But where I got stuck is creating a bitcoin address because all the options involve php or another server side script and as I said tumblr doesn't support that. But suggestion of using a csv file to store addresses might work.
