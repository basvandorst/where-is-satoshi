I do, just like I pray I don't get pulled over for going 9 over, for jaywalking, for torrenting, for showing Disney movies to large groups of people, for betting on sports games, for transporting open containers, for weed, for peeing outside, and for biking on sidewalks.
We each choose our own level of risk, but thanks for the reminder.

Personally, I only day trade with relatively small amounts. I'm pretty sure it would just be a rounding error in the grand scheme, so I'm really only worried about tracking the major moves (whenever I create or eliminate a stack, or inject a noticeable amount of fiat).

I'm pretty sure that's what taxes are about. Like how driving the speed limit is doing 5 to 9 over the speed limit.

Ah, my bad. Still, for the patient buyer, my local Craigslist has a bunch of cars under 50k miles.

Sorry, bud. Average car age in the US is 11.5 years. You might have to reexamine your driving habits.
Edit: 11.6 years as of 2016

Yknow, to each their own. As long as you're not hurtin'. Saw your edit above about driving more. Man, the 9-5 ball and chain. But that's what I'm trying to break with crypto and other investments. Not lavish lambo wealth, but freedom to choose when I want to take a travel trailer across the country. I am managing to rack up some air miles internationally, though.
What stretch of road do you recommend?

According to the post the other day, you can get $200k or something for it!

Your ledger is just the tool that holds the private key that lets you access the wallet in the blockchain. Every transaction and coin is all stored on the blockchain. If the transaction was accepted, doesn't matter what you do (unplug it, burn it in a fire, buy a new ledger and re-enter your seed), the transaction was recorded on the blockchain. If it wasn't accepted (for lack of funds or whatever), the coins will sit in their original location.

Everyone sold their alts to get into BTC to get free money. No free money. Leave in anger.

I read a post last year about a wife who thought she was a genius because she rolled the toothpaste tube and made the toothpaste go further...and the husband who was secretly squeezing toothpaste back into the tube from another one to mess with her.

It's hard to say, since almost everything was up from May to June, so it might've just been a correction when a lot of coins dropped in July. But a lot of coins (ETH, LTC, QTUM, XMR, DASH NAV) definitely skyrocketed in mid-August (probably combination of the fork payout plus outside interest with all the hubbub).
All I know is that with my n=1 sample size, this will be a great opportunity for me to inject some fresh fiat. Then again, as I said in my other comment, I seem to bet on all the wrong horses because news and events just don't seem to help me like they used to.
Edit: Though I guess you're saying that BTC didn't drop after the fork. Guess that's true, though who knows what would've happened without China FUD. I guess then it's artificial in the sense that free money was given out that spurred everything and it wasn't a natural growth... Sure, it worked out mostly, but I don't know how many times we can get away with the free money thing.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:50:29
Sorry, clarification. Yeah, I'm speculating it'll be mostly as you said, and then later on, people will go after some of the lower marketcap stuff where the potential for growth in the short term is greater (that is, 5x...or more likely the kind of 20%-50% overnight growth when something gets listed on a new exchange or a working product is introduced or a partnership is announced). 
I have been noticing more and more lately that that kind of stuff has had less effect than usual lately. Whether it's because money is moving away for the fork or people are just tired of chasing news/rumors or what...
Edit: also, it's probably just confirmation bias. It's just *my* coins that aren't reacting to news.

Artificial in that it's temporary and when this is all over, a lot of people might move their money back into alts seeking 5x gains. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:07:29
I would've lost all my bitcoin twelve times over between mining pools, mt gox, scams, hacks, hard drive failures, forgetfulness, panic sales, pizzas, and on and on. Hell, I accidentally deleted my ethereum wallet two days after I first put money in it.

Yeah, I was a totes noob.  Didn't take the warnings about backing stuff up seriously enough. It's fine, though, it was like a $20 lesson. I immediately bought some more after recovering from my shame the next week.
