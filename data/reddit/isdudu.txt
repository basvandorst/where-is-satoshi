So the thing is not just the exchanges. The wallets are also need to upgrade it. I mean let's say my exchange upgraded to Segwit address, so my wallet should be supporting segwit too in order to count it as a segwit tx?

My %90 of CC is Bitcoin. Is that a high amount?

How can i setup a lightning node?
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:59:44
I think both addresses should be segwit
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:55:40
Is that update going to increase Segwit adoption rate? What do you think?

As long as USD will be the world currency, i will not sell any of my Bitcoins in near future.

So it's a risk? If the recipient wallet does not support it, they will not be able to receive it?

I asked that  because of security concerns. All the entire ports are open now! (I guess i don't know the default options of ubuntu 16.04)
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:32:10
thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:27:37
because things like segwit are aiming the tx fee decrease for the long term

If the price will be correlated with bitcoin price (%10 of it) selling and buying btc will not make any sense. I mean both will gain %10 everytime

After the lock-in part?
@_date: 2018-10-12 12:17:44
But i can see that some nodes are using different ports than 8333? Will it cause sync problem for them?

I mean, a ton of people buy bitcoin to protect themselves from the bad effects of any kind of economic collapse.  After those problems, when it comes to the recovery phase (let's hope that it will) there will be no reason to buy bitcoin.

You don't need any balance on your node i guess? It can be empty by BTC and relay the txs?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:16:07
I need a command line, i cannot do that..

I’m using digitalocean, there are singapore and india which has THE LEAST nodes, i will pay 60$/month in total, but it worth to Bitcoin!

How did you found this percentage?

Why do you think Bitcoin is a gamble? Getting 25 Euro and higher from sending money internationally isn't a gamble? or an order sustainable in future?

The linked address is valid, please check it and compare from Bitcoin.org, if it's valid please upvote my post and contribute to donation!
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:04:07
I know those; but where those guys get the data? From their own nodes?
@_date: 2019-04-18 13:10:24
0 donations! Very sad!
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:32:14
I think they are whipping randomly for they can refund the huge amount to that address?
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:17:03
But the fees will grow at that point?

No, Google Trends is a good indicator to see "interest" on certain project or a value.

yeah, sweet dreams without any mainstay, it will be 10000 but it's off topic

But it would give a "disadvantage" on doing trade. Trying to send 1/1000000... coins would be so messy.
Who knows, maybe 21 million is not the "optimal" amount?

Thank you.
The thing that i don't undestand is , no wallet supports it? Is that a bitcoin transaction? I cannot it's balance it on blockchain.info wallet?

but their card is not available (on pre-order) right now?
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:40:12
So the transaction is sending to the node?
So how are the nodes interacting with miners? How is the bridge between miners and nodes?
