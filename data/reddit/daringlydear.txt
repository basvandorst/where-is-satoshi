I am new to bitcoin and really liked it. I thought it did a great job of explaining bitcoin and the new paradigm. I hated the narration, but other than that two thumbs up.

Does a Coinbase vault count as a wallet?

Yeah I guess could ask several friends to keep chunks of info. I don't understand how bitcoin has made it this far and how it will survive with all these threats and so much complexity. I'm still learning about it but crap.

For fuck's sake why is this so goddamned confusing. I have been following this reddit, have a few on coinbase, and can't ever seem to understand what is going on or do anything right unless i spend all day every day devoted to the topic. Is this even an option for people with a life outside of bitcoin? Sorry, i'm grouchy.

Thank you!!! I will check them out.

Regarding the entire world constantly attacking it, is this what hard/paper wallets can protect you against? So one should use a computer generated pass phrase and keep it in a safe or bank security box?

People really do this? Seems like a lot of work and you'd have to spend a lot of time with the person. Are there examples of people hacking brain wallets? Just curious.

I appreciate your helpful explanation after my hissy fit. I figured I'd buy just enough to scare me into staying on the learning curve but not so much it would devastate me to lose it.

So do you then store the hardware in a safe?

I understand buying the physical representation of bitcoin but I'm still confused as to how you purchase the bitcoin for it. I have coinbase and am learning how to transfer to a hard wallet. But I would like to give small amounts to some young family members as gifts that I can add money to here and there over time. I'm not sure the best way to do that.

Jesus how does bitcoin even survive
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:00:08
Thank you. That helps me understand so much better. Can I send money to their paper wallets from my Coinbase account?

Has anyone ever tattooed their info on themselves? Even in parts in various areas by different artists. Probably overkill but if you lose your body then maybe you don't care about bitcoin

Thank you, that's so interesting. I'm still pretty new and didn't realize you could personalize. I'm still not clear on the concept of how that turns into private bitcoin money but I"ll figure it out.

Seems weird someone would examine small numbers on your body in a public place or during sex. But a wayward emergency medical professional I can see. Or undertaker.

This feels like fake news.
