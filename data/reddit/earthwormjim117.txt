URSAY from the forums says i am on the support list for the day.

lol. that would be worrying.  
I was just trying out shared send to see if i could manage to trace the transactions through several dummy addresses.   It wasn't a massive amount of money, but in retrospect i should have used minimal btc. 
Still sucks that they ate my coins though.

It will initially come through at the current rate.  I emailed charlie and he promptly responded and fixed the exchange rate.

To be fair, I understand that you were the victim of an attack there is a huge backlog of support tickets that need to be dealt with.  What irks me is that they didn't, and still have not put a notice up on their website warning people that this will or might happen to them.  It still just says get your bitcoins in "under an hour"  If i had been notified of a delay beforehand, i still would have went through you, and wouldn't have freaked out when my coins didn't appear instantly.
However, I don't think it is unfair for us to warn people if your company refuses to do so.  I understand you might loose some transactions, but you are in the business of providing financial services.  There is no tolerance for this kind of shenanigans in your industry.

They made it.  It was actually a mistake on the other end.

If you let them have your information it's your own fault.  I also have no sympathy for thieves.  If it's not yours, give it back.

The problem is, as more and more customers have their transactions delayed, and (i hope) bitinstant honors the exchange rate at the time of guaranteed delivery listed on their quotes, bitinstant ends up losing a whole hell of a lot of cash.  At some point they will become unable to pay anyone anything.  I sure hope they have deep pockets.

i will wait and see, the only reason i posted here was because the other shared send transactions between dummy addresses were more or less instant, but maybe that was because they were all on the blockchain.info site?  
now that i think of it on the last transaction a red error message popped up briefly, i think it said something about the previous transaction not being fully confirmed yet but it disappeared before i could finish reading it.

I was happy to see that you announced BTC prices would be honored.  However when i finally saw that my transaction went through today I noticed that this is not the case, it was processed at the current BTC exchange rate.  There is a 24% difference here, this is unacceptable.  I have submitted an email to support.

As long as you honor exchange rates when the payment was made, as is stated in the update on weekend bitinstant transactions everything is cool.
