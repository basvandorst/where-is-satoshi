Do you have a BTCJam account?
@_date: 2015-04-23 13:53:20
Just tried it. It worked! :-)
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:20:01
Ok. Now it worked. BTC sold. Text received. Heading to the ATM down the road...

At 02:01 the video says "For these future developments banks &amp; financial institutions REQUIRE DATA CENTRALISATION".

Coindesk's price data is available. Go [here]( and click "Download Historical Price Data".
I use their API to get price info into Google Spreadsheets to do some basic calculations. Tell me if you are interested and I will share my "formulas".

I am in Spain right now so I decided to try it. Getting this error message:
"Due to the high demand of our service, we had to temporarily restrict the operations. We apologize for any inconvenience. Please check back later."

To get the current price. Change "USD" to another currency if that's what your need.
    =REGEXEXTRACT(JOIN("";IMPORTDATA("
To get a historical price:
    =REGEXEXTRACT(JOIN("";IMPORTDATA("
(I know the regex in the end is not very elegant...)

Done. See images here:  (random order)
I gave the ATM the following data:
Phone number
Reference number
