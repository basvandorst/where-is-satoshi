Quality shit post and all, but everything you said is a pretty legitimate concern about bitcoin imo.

I got all that bad with none of that good. I'd love to have some Bitcoin to support my habit.

Absolutely agree. Banking in its simplified form started roughly 4,000 years ago. Furthermore, banks  currently operate in more or less the same fashion now as they did 600 years ago. Not to mention the essential role they play in  nearly every culture / econemy on the earth. Sorry, but, the invention of bitcoin, blockchain or anything else in the foreseeable future wont change the amount of history, money, and dependence that current society's put into banking. Even seriously thinking that bitcoin could be a serious threat to banking is a convoluted, outlandish idea because they will simply buy out, shut down, or otherwise segregate any threat to their current supremacy.

Bitcoin is literally alive because banks haven't figured out if they like it or not yet.

I was really hoping for some kind of old school like plot to come out of this...

Does that make lost bitcoin caches the 21st century equivalent to a pirates buried treasure?

For real. I'm super excited that crypto is working, but it's easily the most volatile market around. I wouldn't ever be surprised to see a massive plunge here and there for no good reason. Again, glad it's working, but since I didn't get in at under 1000 a bitcoin I'll probably never bother. Not like it's going to replace USD / Euro anytime in my lifetime.

Say what you want, but when your investment goes from being worth almost $20k to $7500 in a month and a half a lot of people start freaking the fuck out. It's obviously not dead, but one big push in the wrong direction from scared shitless investors could push it into irrelevance for a couple more years. Bitcoin doesnt have the safties of the stock market. If a huge panic sell off hapens and continues there's nothing there to stop it.

I also plan on hitting the lotto consecutively in 2019-2022.

Hes not wrong. Sure those problems exist for the dollar, euro, ect but the avenues in which you can persue some sort of litigation is pretty set in stone. Crypto is much harder because the general lack of experience of people dealing with it.

The Internet is one of if not humanities greatest achievements. I don't see how bitcoin could even compare. Maybe if they became the go to currency for every nation but until then.

Can you even imagine spending 27 dollars and having it be worth 10 mil only a couple years later.

MUST GO DEEPER. THROUGH THE CHARTS AS THEY'RE BREAKING UP.
