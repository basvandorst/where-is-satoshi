Can’t you tell me why the tide is changing? I don’t want to buy the book

Why’s the tide changing? Awares me

Is there incentive for running a lightning node?

I saw that movie, it was called “In time”

Strong meme. Bullrun incoming 
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:24:31
This is obviously the early stages of a bullrun. By my calculations, using both a supercomputer and a protractor, I predict $22,125 a coin in about 6 months

Why don't you just use contactless on your card and be done in like 3 seconds? 
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:07:55
Just contact your bank and they’ll be able to sort the whole thing out, and you’ll get your money back
@_date: 2018-06-17 09:59:22


I don't think that stands up. Take Very.co.uk for example. They offer up to 1-year interest-free buy now pay later credit on everything over £250, and for anything less than that, you can take-3 and do it in 3 direct debit payments (again, interest-free). 
By your scenario, they should have higher sale prices as a result because they have to factor in defaults, returns, chargebacks, frauds, etc, but almost everything they have (e.g. Nest Hello, Hive, etc) is all at SRP. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 08:32:14
Looking at the plate, evidently not. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:03:35
The top one already exists. As does the third, I’m pretty sure
@_date: 2018-06-17 10:16:54
Your point was that because of the aforementioned issues with billing and settled transactions merchants factor this stuff into their pricing. This n=1 sample (admittedly), shows that this isn't the case. Same with Amazon, Scan, and other major retailers, that people shop at.

They're showing here on June 6^th - I can't wait for Thursday
@_date: 2019-06-04 12:23:12
Unrelated, but movie theatres are showing the movie again on the big screen for the anniversary of the D-Day landings. I honestly can’t wait to see it, just for the beach sequence alone
@_date: 2019-02-17 13:46:36
Weird. 
Everywhere where I live people are accepting debit and credit, and 99% of everything I pay for is via contactless payment.  
@_date: 2018-11-18 10:25:02
Especially via PayPal which is (somehow) a valid comparison metric for transactions this size.

Hope so, I’m about to dump £500,000 into it

Indeed, but bitcoin is the future /s

I’m sorry, what? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:17:22
Except if it’s that one video you saw years ago that’s now lost forever 
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:07:24
Just to elaborate, it’s structured like so: 
You will only begin to repay if you earn over £21,000 a year, and then your repayments will come to 9% of what you make over that number. 
Earn £21,001? Then you will repay 9% of the £1 you make over the limit, so £0.09 a year. 
If you’re not paid up in 30(?) years, it gets written off.

I remember when my house burned down while I wasn’t home, my bank told me that my money wasn’t accessible anymore and that I was totally broke. I lost my pension, too ☹️
@_date: 2018-03-25 07:46:03
Could you explain cards being worse than cash? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:17:50
I regularly send cash within the UK through my bank to other people, and I’ve never been charged a fee. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:02:31
Sorry, I was just being silly with bitcoin holdings vs. banks and fiat 
If OP hadn’t grabbed everything, it would all have been lost. 
I’m just bored at work, glad everything worked out for our boy though, and his house is relatively good, now

Why is bitcoin adoption good for humankind?

Looks like you’re continually losing money?

I sent my dad £3,000 and the fee was £0

Is there any financial incentive?

In the UK you get a breakdown of how your tax £’s are spent by the government 
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:29:06
It’s backed by math, bro. You don’t understand 
@_date: 2018-04-11 07:55:22
Well that’s stupid

Isn’t the transaction time huge at the moment? 
@_date: 2019-05-24 08:03:42
There should be a paper trail if the money was made through gambling, no? I don’t know any site that doesn’t provide it
@_date: 2019-05-02 11:32:47
Note that the below is just hypothetical, etc etc 
Not necessarily more bitcoin volume. If we assume a scenario where the purchase of bitcoin on the square app is 10 bitcoins bought a week (to make the maths easier), and the price is £1000 a coin, if remains the same at 10 bitcoin a week, but the price doubles to £2000 a coin. Revenues double, but bitcoin volume doesn’t.
