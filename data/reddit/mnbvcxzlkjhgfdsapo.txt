People coming in from that link to disrupt this thread ( or vice versa )

That's circular reasoning, tho.  People getting paid to diss bitcoin would cause bad news.  Bad news in itself is one thing - if you started stoking the flames then there is a chance you're a shill.  Even if you're not - the fact that someone would call you out shouldn't be surprising to a sceptic.

What is the "bit elites" incentive when the majority has the option to use an altcoin?

One would also need to lock themselves into the apple ecosystem.  The walled garden soon turns into a labyrinth

Maybe the price will go down to justify a broader user base adoption?

You willing to bet on it?

...And Is this supposed to be good or bad news?   I can't tell.

What does that even mean dude?  So then you think monopolies are nessicary for freedoms ability to grow?  Please help break that down for me.  I'm not fully relying on bitcoin to be free - I think it's cool tech and it is capable of different things and vice versa.  If fed money is a Ferrari then bitcoin is a lifted 4wd truck or however you want to see it - different purposes.   It's an experiment and nobody is forcing you to use it - both currencies could co exist and be used for different purposes depending on the economy- you can use however many diff coins you want - unless of course you felt it was your right only to have a monopoly on money creation... Like idk perhaps the central bank of the city of London corporation or something like that - but of course those shareholders wouldn't be some of the richest people in the world...
