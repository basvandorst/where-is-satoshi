I don't think there are a million bitcoins for sale.  Every exchange that has a fee structure is doing under 10k bitcoin volume per day.

- I constantly make new accounts and use Tor, no wonder I am interested in a privacy focused digital currency!
  
- I wish I could have posted that I bought 1000 BTC this morning!  Sorry for not being uber rich.
  
- Are you saying I should be going by the orderbook instead of volume?  I don't because the orderbook has a ton of coins that the seller has no intention of selling while the volume is a reliable metric for sold coins on a  given exchange and that number is down across western exchanges while users on exchanges that do KYC is up. 
  
You can fuck off for questioning my intention and sincerity.

I recommend Coinbase for this, they are great.  Very trustworthy.

LEALANA also makes Bitcoin and Monero physical coins.  I think they are the only ones making physical Monero coins.  You can find them for sale in the bitcointalk.com collectibles section.  Really nice stuff!

You don't get to seek asylum in Russia and be against it.  The man is working for the Russian government at this point, there is no way he isn't.

I don't think they could even make it to 1 million coins.  The daily volume on every exchange with a fee structure is trading under 10k coins in a 24 hour period.  The exchanges above that are exchanges without fees so it is safe to assume those volume numbers are inflated due to the same coins trading back and forth.  The market is drying up in front of everyone eyes yet the sprinklers are still running full force, something is going to give.

The only thing wrong here is you questioning my intention.  You are not good at it.  My submission is not a monero pump and I know that sort of thing is not allowed here.

I do love Monero as much as I love Bitcoin but nowhere in that comment did I mention it.

It took over 128 hours for the first block.  Block times over an hour happen a few times a year.

What OTC markets are there at this point?

Use that for what?  Exchanges don't accept prepaid cards.
