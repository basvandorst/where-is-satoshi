I am stuck on actually implementing it, whether that be on testnet or the mainnet. 
All the instructions seem to rely on either your node to be on a linux or local machine, where as mine is on Ubuntu on the digital ocean droplet.

Lets tailor the news articles you find to the current situation. 
If the price was $20k right now, you'd post an article you "found" saying "Latest Prediction Puts Bitcoin at $25k by April 2018". lol

I hope this helps the network a bit! I have been involved in Bitcoin for a long time and it's now time to give back. I hope this helps even a little bit.

Thank you for the awesome feedback! 
Some actual information, rather than bashing this idea, is very helpful. 
I thought about setting up a node on my own hardware, and it’s definitely able to run on my hardware. 
The only thing I am worried about is my ISP with the limits and such. I’ve never run into an issue with my ISP and limits and almost use ~1TB each month. Also, is opening up that port on my network, opening me up to attackers within my home network?

So when it’s time, how would I implement the LN on my node? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:37:17
I'm having trouble implementing mine. I am eager to get this up and running. None of the tutorials or instructions have helped. I am running a droplet on Digital Ocean Linux server. 
How'd you end up adding yours?

Thanks for helping out! I really appreciate it. I really want to help Bitcoin out and I know the next best thing after setting up a full node, is setting up a lightning one. 
So I followed instructions and I receive this error when running 
    cd lightning; make
    cc -DBINTOPKGLIBEXECDIR='"'../libexec/c-lightning'"' -Werror -Wall -Wundef -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations -Wstrict-prototypes -Wold-style-definition -std=gnu11 -g -fstack-protector -I ccan -I external/libsodium/src/libsodium/include -I external/libwally-core/include/ -I external/libwally-core/src/secp256k1/include/ -I external/jsmn/ -I external/libbase58/ -I external/libbacktrace -I .   -DDEVELOPER=1 -DCCAN_TAL_DEBUG=1 -DCCAN_TAKE_DEBUG=1 -DSHACHAIN_BITS=48 -DBINTOPKGLIBEXECDIR='"'../libexec/c-lightning'"'   ccan/tools/configurator/configurator.c  -lgmp -lsqlite3  -o ccan/tools/configurator/configurator
    make: cc: Command not found
    &lt;builtin&gt;: recipe for target 'ccan/tools/configurator/configurator' failed
    make: *** [ccan/tools/configurator/configurator] Error 127
Any idea on how I can go about this?

I want to implement and adopt LN. I am just a little confused when it comes to the implementation. 
Currently I have a full node on an Ubuntu server that is hosted in DO. 
Any help or push in the right direction would be helpful. Almost tutorials or instructions don’t seem to go along with my current setup of my node. 
**Edit: Spelling**

I know we have this sub, and I know people will hate on this idea. 
But I’d love to create an app to be a source of information about Bitcoin and the technology around it as well as any other updated news. 
I’m able to create an app, just wouldn’t know what you guys would want to see inside it. 
I think it would be swell to have a one stop shop for correct and verifiable information. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:55:31
I want to help out as much with getting the lightning network being used. Do I have to have a dedicated rig to run the lightning network, like mining? Or can I use my normal computer?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:06:30
Is there any way I can help with the mempool issue? Even if I can take maybe 10 transactions or something. I know it's only little, but every little bit helps. 
@_date: 2019-11-30 17:35:08
What APIs are you guys using to fetch that data?
@_date: 2019-02-20 11:48:54
Groundbreaking content. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:59:26
I think they banned him there, right? 
@_date: 2019-04-28 21:36:37
You can withdraw to an external wallet. 
I can confirm it. 
Verification was an extremity difficult process. Not because it took many steps but because I kept receiving an error. I then was back and forth with support for many days. But in the end they manually verified me. 
Love cash app for buying Bitcoin.

SOLVED IT!
I was browsing around reddit and randomly stumbled upon [this]( thread. 
I saw that comment and I tried running the command
    sudo ufw status verbose
Long story short, my table output didn't look like the comments. My ports for bitcoin was actually closed on the pi itself, behind the ufw. So what I did was simply
    sudo ufw allow from 8333    
Everything is working now, and it is reachable. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:24:17
Hmmm. That site seems to be down. Getting a *bad gateway* error.
I have used other port checkers and checked for 8333 but no luck. I have literally gone over my open ports like 50 times, and I am positive it is open. And when I look, it shows that port 8333 is in the **LISTEN** state.
When I use the *netstat -tuplen* command, the following is what it shows for the 8333 port.
Proto | Recv-Q  | Send-Q  | Local Address | Foreign Address    | State  | User | Inode  |     PID/Program name
tcp6 | 0   | 0  | :::8333     |  :::*       | LISTEN  | 1000      | 12073   | 1229/bitcoind 
       
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:16:22
I will keep that in mind. Thank you!
Where you able to at least see if you had port 8333 open while syncing?

I am trying to upgrade my node but I am having a bit of trouble. How'd you upgrade yours?
I am running my node on an Ubuntu server. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:46:32
What is that? Sorry if it’s a dumb question. 
I am using [this]( ppa. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:25:25
Yeah I thought I was going crazy all day! Kept refreshing the page.
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:20:46
Correct me if I’m wrong, which there’s a good chance of but I tried this process and it doesn’t seem to realize there’s an update. 
It actually looks like the [ppa]( isn’t updated. 
I will upgrade my node as soon as the ppa is at 0.16.0. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:24:32
It doesn’t look like the ppa is updated yet. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:14:06
[The tune]( is actually pretty hype. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 08:57:26
Here is my [netstat]( It looks very similar to yours.
Still can't get this god damn port open. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:50:27
I am all for compiling my own code. 
I followed [this]( link in that previous thread.
I see this information for *Options when installing required Boost library files*. But underneath that, I see the installation instructions for the PPA. 
How would I go about compiling it myself and then upgrading my node?
