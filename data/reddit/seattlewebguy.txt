He's been doing these videos all week and I'm sure he's tired or sick by now. Just lookup some of the overall changes he's added and you will see how crazy crypto is getting. Decentralized Government, Decentralized Friends Lists, Decentralized Voting, it's all there.
@_date: 2015-12-14 23:45:57
Build awareness! The amount of people who have even heard of Bitcoin is still tiny. Bitcoin mobile games, Bitcoin news platforms, Bitcoin wallets, Bitcoin brands, this goes for most crypto currencies honestly. The amount of jobs that will be made out of this industry is going to be insane...
@_date: 2015-12-14 03:18:41
er ma gawd. I NEED MORE BITCOINS! This is all happening too fast honey, can we just slow things down please??
@_date: 2015-12-16 00:27:40
Lol for a while it was the only story we had to go with, just let it roll.
@_date: 2015-12-13 23:42:47
This is huge....
@_date: 2015-12-15 06:19:18
This guy is the real deal and I can't believe my eyes. He decentralized everything. He did what we've all been telling our friends "Bitcoin COULD do" He's doing it all in one project. He knows his stuff and everyone should give this a look.
@_date: 2015-12-15 00:14:25
But said ideas require you to really know the market enough to see a need for something to change. Most of those people are either doing wallet software or working in the payments layer or a whole other altcoin altogether.
@_date: 2015-12-13 21:07:32
This is the first time I have seen KeepKey and I gotta say, it looks pretty damn nice. I'm actually worried about how much time we have left to hoard some moar coin..... :/ I regret spending as much as I have up until now lol....shit..
@_date: 2015-12-16 00:20:20
I ran into this as well, but can see how it was solved and that people could say the same amount BTC seeing as 1/20th of the coins are in one single wallet. But hey, to each your own.
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:52:24
what a mom!
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:19:51
If I wrote up the whole story starting three years ago, you'd see I'm more of a pro bitcoin fan in their eyes not some crazy  person. Haha but I totally see your point.
@_date: 2016-01-04 07:32:30
Whoa.. Biggest tip I've seen in a year haha good stuff!
@_date: 2016-01-02 08:52:06
I saw it a few weeks back and this is exactly what I thought too. Great movie too!
@_date: 2016-01-04 07:29:37
You sound like someone who would like to hear about :p 
@_date: 2016-01-04 07:27:04
has decentralized budgeting voting and governance built in to solve this problem, Bitcoin should add this. Also the 45/45/10 miner reward split is cool as shit
@_date: 2016-12-01 07:13:27
Ding dong we have a winner

Show her the lifetime chart of the price, its up something like 44k% over 5 years. Then show her how every arge company is already jumping in on this tech. But first explain how its nothing more than email for the money transferring world, not necessarily just a new currency.

Buy a gift card on your phone from Gyft. You now own a giftcard.
edit: if its a loan you are going for you better do you're homework and then use your own information to convince them. Because if I could ask my parents for money, best believe they would be convinced right about now haha. The evidence and reasoning are right in front of you. Make sense of it and tell them.

How? I am fully prepared to hold his coins for 10 years and pay him off out of pocket. It's going to be under a grand anyways, not a big deal at all. Just trying to hand hold a few people until they are comfy to take over. They can do what they want with the money, I just want my cut later for all this effort and managing and teaching. And there will be a cut. If anyone of you didn't believe this, you wouldn't be here.
@_date: 2015-02-13 08:08:21
Use coinbase.com or bitpay.com and convert to Fiat if you don't wanna hold your coins for future possible gains or to use them.
And you don't have to report certain gains, especially if its under a certain amount. Something like 1,000 dollars. If its more, its taxed like normal untaxed money once converted to fiat as if you were a contractor I would assume.
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:45:59
This is so awesome, please don't eat it.
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:58:28
Someone delivered on the r/music thread we hijacked it looks like.
Now all you need is a badge to get these artists tipped from ANY website. (If you don't already have it) I would imagine this getting enough traction to really take off honestly. Start with the indie music folks and go from there.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:06:15
I don't see why they wouldn't if they wanted to just completely shit on Apple Pay....
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:17:16
Technology changes and improves everyday. Storage space, Internet speeds and the actual time it will take to reach this level of volume will let us see these issues coming and fix them.

All forked from some obviously templated system. Smart.
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:47:15
This is sorely needed. And they need to make it simple and to the point. 
edit: imagine if they approached it like CC companies and just started railing them on every selling point, before long people will start to catch on and word of mouth is a very powerful thing at that point.
"you charge 5%?, well Bitcoin charges a penny."
"I expect 1% savings return each year - Said no Bitcoin supporter ever"
"$4.99 to pickup money from your friend using Western Union - Bitcoin is free and instant"
so on and so forth.

Viral campaigns like this are going to be sooo useful... especially to a company like ChangeTip which can infiltrate quite a few markets.... golly these are exciting times.
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:15:55
In 5 years? Yea thats not going to happen sorryyyy
Everyone said email was useless, everyone said HTTP was useless, everyone even called "that network of computers they call the internet" a fluke.
Welcome to denial.
@_date: 2015-02-15 00:30:31
How? I don't see a high end hacker with such a skillset wasting his time on me.when there are plenty of better targets with less.security. They would need to steal.my whole.identity to get my money with 2fa enabled. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:46:37
I'm referring to the best way to have random people understand the value quickly.
@_date: 2015-02-14 22:10:26
Why not make a play on the PC vs Mac commercials LOL
"Im a BTC user, what are you?"
"Fiat, I like it old school"
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:15:34
These things are most likely just forks of one another with the same security bugs. GG. Note to new exchanges, go hard or go home (broke). Or to jail.
@_date: 2015-02-12 07:22:52
Why of course! No fiat payments please hahahhaa. Hit me with a pm and well discuss :)
And thanks for the tip! I regretfully had to cash out recently due to.life and bills.
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:44:53
Bitcoin will be the underlying tech that changes finance. Thats the point. If we let them keep raping us, they will do just that.
Change has to be forced. Tech companies are seeing an opening in finance just like they have done in all other industries they jump into. Its disrupt time. It just so happens its finance this time around.
And the 50% drop thing imo was caused my market manipulation, stop blaming Bitcoin and blame Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:21:52
Yes. Tell them you'll pay a bit extra and they can send it straight to their bank account and bypass CC fees and they are usually like oh sure why not.
Unless you look sketch obviously...
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:00:35
Seems pretty plausible to me. I mean if I was coinbase that would be my first targeted acquisition. It's a no brainer.
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:45:14
Someone should just make a bot or website that does exactly this, leverages changetip/coinbase api and sorts artists by category or something fun like that. I would love to be able to surf for new music and pick it up iTunes style off a website, or even just help that new artist out. Much preferred to being stopped on the street to listen to some guy rap, don't get me wrong I enjoy it, but timing is everything. I'm usually only going to buy music when I want to buy music.
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:34:33
I have a lot more faith in humanity than that sadly. I honestly believe in 2 years bitcoin is going to be HUGE compared to how it is now. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:10:07
I know, hence me dealing with it and him just wanting a 200% return at any point in the future when. If I make 400% I keep the rest. The upside for this are rather awesome seeing as most of it is going to be in LTC. And going from 2-5 bucks per coin should be rather simple. Especially within a year....
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:48:57
I know, I'll change it. As someone else pointed out "I'm high" and wasn't too worried about word choice when I wrote this.
i know see people just like to cherry pick parts of questions instead of actually answering the damn question. No problemo.
@_date: 2015-02-13 09:04:23
I love you right now. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:03:29
Lol the sarcasm is real!
I'm just saying, the shit helps, or businesses wouldn't even try to use it. It's corny, annoying and spammy but hey don't assume it doesn't help.
@_date: 2015-02-14 21:20:16
It's only going to get worse from here on out, and my bet is more money will be stolen from Banks than the general Bitcoin market.. It's much harder to hack and sneak past login, email confirmations and 2FA than your average bank security to some of these hackers. Legacy banking ftw!
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:26:14
I have no idea how you don't understand this:
Percentages to no matter in this sense because the market size is SO IMMENSELY DIFFERENT that it is not fair to say something like this. If the markets switched, you COULDN'T steal 7% of such a large market. See how this works? I understand your point, but you are missing mine. Equal out the market size, then try telling me someone could steal that much money from one market at once. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:11:36
Anyone know people in the market in Uruguay? :p
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:09:10
I mostly support litecoin because there is no way only one crypto will succeed. bitcoin is the more prominent one obviously.
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:05:44
Wow. Way to put it in perspective for me, thanks.
I fully agree with most of the things you touched on minus the fact this is specifically a technology class, all of these kids feed of just playing around in flash and html with some video editing and other misc subjects.
I feel like if I pointed out how important of times they are living in and how this could possibly be one of the most recent and exciting technical developments since email or the internet. They would be rather interested from the get go. I obviously want to touch on why we use USD and store wealth in gold then transition into what the future might or might not look like. 
I feel like my main job is to spark interest, these kids will go off on their own and learn everything 10x faster anyways. They can learnt he details of how it all works, I just want to be there to introduce the ideas and let them think about it. I could care less if they go home and get right into it, as long as they are aware of whats changing in the world around them.
I am so grateful I stumbled into piracy and the internet as early as I did, I would have nothing today without such technologies lol. And I was like 10! These kids are already 12+. I think they can handle it, hell some of them make better websites than I do and its becoming depressing!

Just start linking threads to things you think people deserve to get tipped for.. from pancake pictures to an awesome story about how some guy saved the local dog. Doesn't matter. Just need a list of places for people to go drop tips off because tipping all day in does relatively nothing for us.
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:06:45
Except the bank is going to ask me what I want it for.
@_date: 2015-02-14 21:21:09
Lets hope changetip had something to do with it, it would be nice to see Bitcoin marketing catch on more.
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:08:58
I said assuming it's accepted everywhere the dollar would be lol it's hypothetical
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:40:36
I understand that. These are obviously all opinions. Hence the title of the thread. 
That doesn't mean I'm wrong. If Bitcoin rallies, Litecoin rallies twice as fast to catch up. Whether this is from people trying to jump in and make a buck or not beats me but it would be the perfect situation for another 500+  percent return like last year.
@_date: 2015-02-15 06:38:56
Thank you very much sir!
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:42:30
I'm educated enough to believe in this for my own real reasons. Not because I hope to get rich. I make that very clear to everyone. I make sure they understand its a longterm investment and they should keep an eye on the price every couple weeks to make sure they don't want to cash out thier initial investments.
I'm fine, I have no risk. I've always been the local go to tech guy and people know when I speak, I am speaking the truth to the best of my knowledge.
I'm too loved anyways. Psh.

I always love how the simplistic comments make the top, start upvoting better content people! We know the world needs BTC, we don't need to repeat it to one another everyday.
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:23:28
HAHAH it's funny that you mention that, thats exactly how I am. I mean shit man my ex of 7 years is now with my best friend and it doesn't even phase me.
i'm am not worried about he relationship at all. I would gladly own up and pay him what we agreed to and keep the coins.
@_date: 2015-02-14 21:49:57
We don't need dreamland style commercials, we need boring reasoning why BTC is better than its alternatives for the average users without getting to complex. Only then will it be freely adopted with the need for all of our constant preaching.
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:17:58
You're telling me businesses want to keep paying CC fees? That would be their next best option even if everything was allowed and not scrutinized because its "weed". I'd say BTC provides more value than signing up for CC in that sense.
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:15:41
It gets easier EVERY SINGLE day. Imagine a world where everyone had Bits available, you could trade with anyone at anytime. Who needs ATM's anymore?
@_date: 2015-02-23 05:24:52

@_date: 2015-02-13 19:02:23
Who said we took the assumption it would take over any 1 market? The point is it will take over small portions of every market at first and go fro there. No one needs total domination around here sorry to disappoint you buddy.

You are such a troll its great. You almost come off as smart, then you just fall off the cliff.

If I was in a position in life to do this, I still don't think I would put more than 50% into a crypto portfolio, you don't wanna be the guy who loses EVERYTHING for 3 years until BTC finally takes off... and by then you were forced to use your coins to save your ass for those 3 years. Meh. Not fun.

They would lose control of their economy in a small sense, and I feel like Putin and his buddies wouldn't really be okay with this. Maybe if they saw some sort of profitability from it that outweighed the small loss of control would we see them endorse Bitcoin. This could be said about most Governments though..
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:29:24

@_date: 2015-02-23 19:52:23
Like I said, I know them. I am a Web Designer and am working with them on thier new website, I have eaten here for 11 years. This approach doesn't work if you aren't available to be accountable when they cant figure out how to hookup their bank account to coinbase.
Not everyone wants to hold BTC right now. So I always make sure to let people know they have to send it to their bank account if they want cash.

The margins on Litecoin are and have been so exciting to watch in the past. Due to certain market restrictions and how people are still only comfortable with BTC, Litecoin is bound to take off after Cryptos are here and people are more used to them. Once Bitcoin takes off again, LTC is going to shoot from 2-50. Watch.

How did you make this awesome little chart? Excel?
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:11:14
Its not when you can use common sense to say there are areas of finance that need cleaning up which would cause small portions to be diverted to Cryptos. Even if Bitcoin got .5-1% of a few select markets, it would be beneficial for everyone and just so happens the price goes up because of this. Thats his point which you completely miss by staring at his numbers the whole time with your negative attitude. I'm not even surprised by your conclusion, just trying to clear up what idea was being presented.

It's not my money. Just the extra profits will be and he can pull out when he pleases. I am just helping him get this going and he basically said we'll write a contract that says he only gets 200% if there is anything more I get to keep it all. And he's a family friend so it's not like I'm going to get hunted down. I've known him 15 years and he trusts my opinion on the matter just isn't a technology guy.

Still working on this, I should have a couple ads remade in the next couple days and I'll drop by and post em.
@_date: 2015-02-14 21:23:42
I had proposed this idea a few days ago.

In terms of the longterm traction, I still stand by my statement. If Bitcoin takes off we're going to see such a scattering of money that a lot of us are bound to make a very nice chunk of change. Not anything crazy but returns will be through the roof. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:56:33
I was waiting for a CNN article about this lol. its just CNN but hey we're making it one way or another. FIAT is so oldschool. Psh.
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:37:59
I wasn't kidding lol I just wanted to provide a more level headed answer after I read what I posted. :]
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:37:29
Yea but we don't want to push it like a ponzi scheme though, I feel like the price should e the last thing kids learn about as not to dilute the point of the tech..

I was once charged $400.00 USD for a 30 cent overdraft on my part. Fuck em. They did this to themselves.

Fuck the moon, to Mars.
edit: Lightbulb! lets get that new Mars colony started with BTC, then we could have them included in the economy. :D /sarcasm
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:08:10
I am sorry but adoption and wallet creation rate charts over the past year suggest you are making a harsh assumption about the attitudes of people.
I am very confident in this system. Whether Bitcoin dies off and gets replaces is no issues, I will just transfer the coins over or cash out while I watch the new market evolve, just like I have for the past 2 years.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:49:16
Aww you're so nice! I have beenb eating my head against the wall as I am in between jobs and would love nothing more than to blow my whole check on BTC right now...
One day these 100 bits will be worth 100 bucks. /fingerscrossed

I'm going for volume, people can go learn the details of the system themselves. As no 20 minute conversation will ever really be good enough.

They get shutdown when making accounts or using personal ones because its "drug" money in the eyes of lawmakers still.

I bought in at 120, 150, 160, 190, 250 and sold at 900.
I win. Get off the high horse and start paying more attention and using that critical thinking you are so lucky to have. Read some more internets and you'll get these feelings for when rallies might or might not occur based on signals from all around the world from tech news to finance news to political scandals, bank robberies, new hacks. All of it provides hints at where the world is headed. And Bitcoin(cryptos I mean, buzzwords, gosh.) is right up this new worlds alley.
And yes I am high, is that an issue sir? It's a much better option than ADHD meds. 
Anyways, good luck with you're "worst performing investment" opinion because we all know it's going to bite you in the ass one day.
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:55:19
Best investment opportunity we're going to see in our life times.
This is as big as the internet no matter what people tell you. It's already here, until something better replaces it the value will continue to rise. EVERYONE has one reason they could use Bitcoin to make something cheaper or easier.
And I like the fact I have no borders for my money or people in my pockets.
@_date: 2015-02-18 03:20:10
Definitely working on this already. I shat myself with ideas when I first saw the potential of bitcoin.org being squandered.
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:19:11

@_date: 2015-02-17 18:38:07
Perfect thank you.
Would you say this is an ideal way to give people Bitcoin who have never seen it before? Changetip is nice and all but only works certain places. (yes I know they have a payment profile page as well)
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:04:29
How? if Bitcoins market were alot bigger, Mt. Gox wouldn't have had such a huge share of the coins, this is just a side effect of having such a small under developed market.

Not ALL banks refuse to work with MMJ businesses, just the larger dickish ones, and thats only due to Federal regulations and them being a holes.
All I'm saying is most people don't wanna drive 2 hours to meet this guy to pay him 5-12 grand in cash and get a few pounds of product. Take the money out of that transaction, it gets alot simpler.
Do you know how many times I have had to count at 10 grand in 100s, 50s and 20s? I never thought counting money would be such a chore until days like that...
and don't remind me about having to recount to be sure.... the ulcers finally healed..
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:47:07
That is hideous though. We obviously would want something modern and clean.

There would be so many epic chance cards... but the community chests would be rather boring. "Mining reward, yay" or "Bitcoin goes mainstream, collect 500% of your current Bitcoin cold storage".
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:03:39
That's a great point, but maybe it's just me... this doesn't seem like such a big problem if you are aware of the markets.
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:12:07
Use dem celebs!
edit: ok fine seriously though we need more exposure, who cares if people pick it up right away. We need to cast this net as wide and far as possible because the main problem I see is lack of common knowledge about what cryptos are and why they are good for the average joe...

Hey guys look, its Jesus!
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:18:03
I don't agree with the idea that 7% of a market can be taken unless the market is extremely small. Thats it. Nothing more. I don't care if one had 12% and one had 1% taken, the amounts don't matter in percentages. Stop cherry picking data to make it look scary. If we had a trillion dollar market, no one would be able to steal 7% of a market because that amount of money wouldn't be in 1 location.
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:00:44
It's not exactly a claim more of a speculative assumption but alrighty. Everything is so black and white with you guys it's kind of funny. Keep  being negative, I'm sure that will get you places. :[

Someone should go around interviewing businesses that are interested in accepting or already accept BTC and do it "hells kitchen style" without the anger. Setup them up for BTC, show them how it works, film it all and come back a few months later to interview them. These would spread like crazy.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:42:21
Exactly. I want to get them out of this " I am a citizen of this place and they own me and my money" attitude that we have all been raised to follow.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:41:12
Thats exactly what my top secret plan is, I'm just going to start doing 1 per week or more if I get into it. Just trying to get a list of ideas. Hoping to get a sort of meme style campaign going against the atrocities of our current system and how EASILY we can improve them without much effort.
est way to do that imo is just call them out on their half assed marketing. I've always hated being dishonest in marketing anyways so this is sort of a calling for me lol.
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:54:00
Not all shops make enough money to require this layer of security. Just a small portion of them like any other market. And they are usually the main targets because who wants to steal $1 when you can get $100? No criminal ever.

If you can get into making an app for this, I feel like it would work rather well. Who needs Chase QuickPay? Psh.
How do you see yourself progressing of the next few years? Just offering the service and coasting on it or are there other projects in the pipeline to add to this?
How do you plan to tackle the lack of understanding when it comes to newcomers? Like what if I wanted to tip some random person online just because I liked his music, would it be rather easy for said person to get involved without knowing a lot about BTC and get his/her money rather efficiently? Or are they just stuck with the BTC until its usable everywhere or until they want to go learn more?
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:10:02
"Legal" growers are just the governments attempt to best monetize and tax weed. I am a "legal" grower even though I have nothing more than a medical card.
And for the record, Washington is completely fucking it up when it comes to making our laws work. We are on the verge of shutting down medical altogether it seems they want us paying 200% price hikes for these "legal" growers you refer to all while those same growers see a 50% reduction in profit moving into recreational as opposed to medical. They have the whole system screwed up already.
I want legalization, not taxation. Please and thank you. And who cares about suspicions, this world is full of people who assume things. I can tell you for a fact at least 30% of medical card holders actually NEED to use cannabis. The other 70% range from potheads to legitimate needs like ADD. I much prefer smoking or eating a brownie to taking a pill that makes me feel like a zombie.
Just sayin.
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:10:47
Owell, ApplePay can't even compete with Bitcoin long term. let them give us exposure without even knowing it. Let people get used to this "new" idea of mobile payments, then let BTC swoop in and destroy their whole plan.

Think.micro payments. The fees included with such a system based on our current financial Structure is almost impossible. With bitcoin that becomes much simpler.

This is just due to stigma from the past 70 years. It will slowly fade away, I have turned so many people into supporters just be explaining the reasoning behind legalization. People get it, they just don't spend time trying to think about it like some of us. Priorities, ya know?

Helll yes they would. Thats the only complaints I hear from them is having to deal with so much cash volume, its like dealing with paperwork when we have perfectly good digital systems to make it easier on us.
I was thinking Bitpay, but the last thing we need is some ahole senator to be like " OH LOOK THEY ARE ILLGEALLY USING BOTH BTC AND MMJ! LETS MAKE A NEW LAW!" Then the whole industry gets cutout in one fowl swoop. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:34:08

@_date: 2015-02-12 15:41:46
That's a very thoughtful article. But you shouldn't take it to heart so much, technology needs to be pushed to the masses. Not just the elitist group. edit: and just like everyone else, we want this process to happen faster, because the question of "is it Bitcoin dead or alive?" is long behind us honestly. So now that we know it can be successful, we should be pushing awareness all the time. It's our duty as humans to help other humans.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:09:10
As someone who worked in this Industry and still provides web services to it, I would say Bitcoin would be a HUGE asset to every single shop owner or grower or producer or even the customers.
Being required to pay cash at 80% of locations sorely hinders sales and is rather slow and frustrating when you owe a grower 5 grand and all you have is cash... Bitcoin would simplify this whole business for everyone involved, but it would need to be using Bitpay or a service like that because the average business owner is not going to go figure this tech out on their own..
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:47:12

Thats the goal of this  , just from a programmers side of things.

Ok you might have a good point with that but still, the average person doesn't even know what HTTP or how email works and they are used to power the world. If Bitcoin doesn't have the same sort of value, I might need to go see a therapist because I might be nuts.
edit: and I do believe that after most people understand Bitcoin they rather agree with its usefulness, the ones who don't are generally harder to work with because you have to start with explaing what money really is and so on and so forth.
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:35:53

Litecoin is insanely undervalued is my point. If Bitcoin rallies, Litecoin rallies harder. I bought my last batch of LTC at 2.40 and sold at 35. Its going to happen again it's just a matter of time.
edit; to answer you're question more directly, from what I understand from a few years of following cryptos is Litecoin has a real chance to take over a large part of the merchant space due to the speed of trasactions but I know everyone in usually has this "one coin" mentality. I can't exactly see this system working without 3-5 coins constantly being used, for different purposes and cases obviously.
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:04:09
Exactly lol. We're at the new bottom, only way to go is up imo.
@_date: 2015-02-12 07:37:05
I'm confused. What does that question mean? I was referring to one of the useful aspects of the system. There are many more. The blockchain tech is profound in itself even if bitcoin was worth nothing. It's a virtual trust system essentially. This.could power so many new platforms to come.

@_date: 2015-02-23 17:22:20
I always pay for things and we always trade off.
my exact words were " let me pay for dinner so I can show everyone how Bitcoin works."
This was not a debate between me and chase. Just me showing my friends this technology without having to force it down their throats until it made sense, like we all seem to think we have to do.
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:30:32
This just makes me feel like people should take their personal security more serious. Less trust needs to be in place for money in general.

I tried helping lol everyone is too naive still. Give it some time and keep dropping hints. He'll we could even just start this process ourselves... just go publicly tip your favorite artists in social media, AMAs, YouTube, or even just mail some paperwallets with thank you letters. There is a lot we can do without asking the big companies to do it for us.

You have a very impatient mindset, no one said I expected there to be profits this year or even the next year.
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:02:34
I totally get that, but at a certain point in the future, wouldn't the two essentially be competing with one another? I mean unless we see a departure from Fiat and not gold that would make sense, but I can't shake this idea that Bitcoin is essentially gold 2.0..
@_date: 2015-02-14 22:01:49
I am not wrong. I do marketing. If you want to show the benefits of BTC and CAUSE AN EMOTIONAL appeal, you call them out and say HEY LOOK theres a better product you aren't using, stop thinking and go check it out!
thats good emotional marketing, not just some crapshoot "TO THE MOON" shit. That theme is for holders and people ideologically aligned with Bitcoin. Not for the average mom and pop who might just want to use it to wire money, or the student who knows he gets 3% back using Gyft. Bitcoin is not a silver bullet, we will not see the whole world switch over from the current systems to "some new Bitcoin powered one" in our lifetime. SO we should let people use Bitcoin as intended, which is, how they WANT to use it. And the best way to achieve this is to have a million little comparisons between Bitcoin and current solutions until everyone starts to get it.
Noone wants to read a technical paper on BTC, we know this, I agree. But we also cant pull some "Bitcoin is for cool smart people, we're all gunna get rich" like everyone seems to think.
Not everyone thinks the same. No biggy. We can't assume they do though.
tell me this doesn't cause an emotional appeal and I'll shutup right now.

Only naive people speak like this. Sorry you aren't educated on the subject enough to see the incredible upsides with this tech. :[

I feel like bitcoin will cannibalize gold at least a little. Why do you want competing investments?

Faster confirmations and more coins make litecoin a merchant sided coin because of the very fast transactions. USUALLY 4x faster confirmations. It's a scrypt coin. will edumacate you
