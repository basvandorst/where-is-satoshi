Yeah, I left it mining overnight, and my balance is at 0.00001360. Not worth the electricity.

Thanks for the information, I now understand this much better!

You're correct, I'm going to download DiabloMiner and try to get that up and running today.

With my hardware, it would be ages before I get any returns at all. The minimum payout from some of the pools I was looking at would take me years to reach.

I'll look into Armory, thanks for the tip!

Hmm, that seems like a really obvious thing that you'd want to do! Do you know if there's any particular reason that QT doesn't make it easy? Also, what is the easiest way to switch to a different wallet? Should one simply send their bitcoins to new addresses at the new wallet, or can you import the old addresses?
Sorry for all the questions, I've been reading a ton, but I'm still a bit lost with all of this! It's exciting though, haha.

I'll have to read more about that, that's very interesting! I wonder why that actually causes problems with imports.

That's true, but if there is a way for me to get some BTC easily, just to get started, I'd be happy.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:54:35
This is what I will do, in that case! I in fact do no know what is meant by change, haha.

I haven't encrypted my wallet yet, I read somewhere that this generates new addresses?
