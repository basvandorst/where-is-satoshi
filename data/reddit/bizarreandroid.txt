Ahh fair enough, had a feeling it was might be worth buying the bullet and just do it. Had a lot of recommendations for coinbase

Unfortunately not I don't own a business, i saw on the news a while back about a photographer that took bitcoin, I live further up north, you don't see many businesses around here accepting bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-06-16 17:25:04
Pfft, yeah course it's so obvious now, why didn't I think of that before 
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:15:19
Will it not appear on there account where it come from? 
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:26:07
Weren't they doing that anyway?? I though when it hit around 15000 mark then they were searching old HDDs and the like

How come never PayPal?? It's the way I usually pay, and wasnt really comfortable with handing over my card details 
@_date: 2018-06-16 11:24:48
What's the smallest amount you can but because most of the exchanges I've seen are like £40-£50
@_date: 2018-06-16 11:37:11
I believe so, a friend of mine has bought from there I think, probably was gonna be an option
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:38:05
Tell me to piss of if it's too personal but how do you pay, is it safe??

So theoretically there is no limit to how much a bitcoin could be, as eventually there could be a single Bitcoin left in the system meaning it is priceless but then like 0.0000000000001 bitcoin could be like £1000 still so we would only need the one as we're using so little of the coin as equivalent to a lot of money

Probably a stupid question, bacuse there not a reality yet, but how?? Like trying to do data recovery on HDDs?? 
@_date: 2019-08-30 08:26:18
Pretty severe tbf. I'm up £7 overall.
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:33:32
How come you have to add a mobile number?? Do you just use it to verify you human once and then can you remove it??

Im not saying its problematic just it's a little bit more complicated it seems, however no that the wonderful world of Reddit has given me a few options and put me straight doesn't seem so difficult. Thanks Reddit 
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:37:39
Not really bothered about being anonymous, just not 100% sure why they wanted my mobile number, do you just use it the once to verify yourself?? 
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:55:46
Nah wasn't 100% I had a vague idea, but wanted to make sure purely because I saw the big bang theory episode, and realised that there must have been loads that have been deleted 
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:10:28
So it doesn't matter how few we have it can still be used by everyone, but also does everyone have to agree that we split it again or can I just add an extra 0 and split it to a smaller amount myself before sending it? 
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:19:29
If you can afford to take your chances then do it whilst you still can. As long as you don't make stupid decisions and put crazy amounts in you should be okay. I'd you can afford to then do so.
@_date: 2019-10-26 10:26:57
Uh oh. Oh shit.

Thats gotta be one hell of a banana, $8000 (ish) for one, thats one hell of a banana.

It depends on if you believe it will go higher, no body knows what'll happen. I would personally say it would but I don't know a lot tbf.
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:47:51
$3000 dollars but didn't think it would increase much more, then it hit $20,000 when it came back down to $5000 that's when I bought, damn wish I'd bought earlier.
