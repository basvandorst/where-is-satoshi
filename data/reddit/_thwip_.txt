None taken, bro.  I completely agree that crypto is not usable for the average Joe right now, and won't be until proper infrastructure is built to make it more fool-proof.
Once hardware wallets gain exposure, I think it'll be much easier for users.

And then you'll kick yourself eternally for not buying when you first heard of it!

Key managment.  It's easier for some folks to have a 3rd party manage the cold storage.

Go to the Paper Wallet tab and click the BIP0038 encrypt box.  Create a password/passphrase and now you'll have an extra layer of security.
For an even greater level of security, download the website as an HTML file and create your addresses on an offline computer.

How do you also factor in the "when," though?  If you can't prove when you bought them, do you automatically also get the short-term capital gains rate?

Every transaction that hits the blockchain gets recorded publicly.  Once you spend the coin on the first USB, they are no longer available for spending anywhere else.
Saving to a paper wallet or on a USB merely gives you the secure access to the bitcoin recorded on the blockchain.  You aren't copying the bitcoin directly, just the access credentials.

No problem, friend.  We all start somewhere!  Yes - always be secure with your private key!  It's the means to BTC ownership.  Anybody that has access to an unencrypted private key has full access to your funds.
Regarding the BIP0038 portion, this means that not only will you need the private key to spend, but also the additional password/passphrase you create everytime you send an outgoing transaction.  
If you somehow lose the paper wallet, then someone couldn't spend your coins even though they found the private key.
Regarding the other portion (saving the website as an HTML), this is more secure as you can now generate your keys on a PC that doesn't touch the internet.  It's an additional way to be certain that no one has ever had access to them.

I don't mind at all.  Happy to help.  Your thought process is pretty solid.  
Yup, Coinbase is the easiest way to obtain BTC in the US.   It's where I've puchased all of mine over the last six months or so.  It's not good for day-trading, so if you want to quickly buy and sell, you're better off going to an actual exchange.  But for a buy-and-hold strategy, there's nothing easier/safer than Coinbase right now.  Your first transaction with them will take 4-5 business days, though.  The verification process is pretty rigorous.   
I'm not sure if you know, but you don't have to puchase an entire bitcoin.  I think Coinbase supports very small amounts (like $20 or less), so if you want to practice on nominal amounts, go for it. 
Your first three bullet points are all good.  As for the fourth, here's what I do for storage.  Everyone has different methods, so do what makes the most sense for you: 
Whenever I purchase BTC, I send it to an encrypted address I created from bitaddress.  
I print the paper wallet and put it in a fire resistant box.  I also save it to a word doc on two USB sticks.  I usually keep these in safe places in different locations.  I typically don't separate the public and private address.  Anything I put on a paper wallet is designed to be long-term savings.  As a practice, it's usually less secure to keep using the same address over and over after you've spent from it.  So whenever I have new savings, I usually just put it on a new paper wallet.
Anything I want immeadiate access for spending stays in my Coinbase or Blockchain online wallet.  As we see from the Gox fiasco, always leave small amounts. 
Then finally, I go to blockchain.info and search my public address. I save this search to my favorites folder, so I can monitor the balance without having to dig anything out in the future.

I think he's saying that you could get 1300 for $1 total, not $1 each.
Like how the first pizza was purchased with 10k coins, which effectively means that each coin costs fractions of a penny.
I think he meant that he'd want to buy them directly from Satoshi in 2009, lol.
