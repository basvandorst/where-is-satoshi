Well fuck me.

Right, so it's *technically* possible, but chances are so remote that it may as well not be?
Edit: So is this one of those things that theoretical "quantum" computing would completely fuck over?

Okay, I've just done some research on this but I'm still not 100% clear when it comes to brainwallets, as this is the first I'm hearing of them.
My understanding is that you'd generate the wallet using the seed each and every time you wanted to send any coins with it.
My question is, if a wallet that already exists can be regenerated with the right seed, how come someone can't just do that with regular wallets? 
Why can't someone just generate random wallets until they get one with a lot of bitcoins in? is there some protection in place that stops this happening with a regular wallet?
Edit: Like say you had 100 bitcoins in [cold storage.]( What's to stop someone just getting lucky and generating your cold storage wallet and stealing all your bitcoins?

It looks like there's about 50 per page, so you also need to multiply that number by 50. 
But that number does look about right.
2^256 = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665

I actually don't keep much currency in bitcoins. I don't really have anything to buy with them in the UK. Other than stuff that's otherwise... difficult to obtain.

That puts a lot of things into perspective. Thank you.

Basically like a rainbow table of brainwallets?
