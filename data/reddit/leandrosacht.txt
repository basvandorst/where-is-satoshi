My hatred for banks today reached ATH.

Pokémon cards are tulips. Bitcoin is store of value.

You gotta buy that dip!

They degrade and aren’t programmable. It was a store of value.

They are a scam. They also gave Monero the same rating as Verge, and both a lower rating than Dash.
They are clearly biased and clueless.

Everything. BTC is a threat to the role banks play in modern society. It gives control over money back to people.
If they weren’t worried by this, they wouldn’t be stopping support for crypto exchanges in Korea, Brazil, India and China, to name a few countries. 
Edit: fuck banks.

Exactly! This is what comes to mind when someone comes up with this narrative that Bitcoin mining is the best and - dear God - the \*only\* solution to wasted energy. 
There is already "out there" trust-minimizing alternative strategies that are much more energy-efficient than regular PoW, e.g. Proof Of Capacity. I wonder if it wasn't Hal the anonymous dev who came up with the first implementation back in 2014.

Blockchain is just a shared database. Bitcoin is much more than blockchain.

LOL, guess who bought at 19k?
@_date: 2019-02-06 12:14:44
He’s one of the biggest investors in Lightning Labs.

Pass this joint yo, I want to get high as well.
@_date: 2018-11-07 00:48:40
Certainly better than PoS, but still not justifiable. Proof-of-capacity is an energy-efficient PoW, takes the best of both worlds without the downsides.

Bcash. LOL

Yes, yes and yes.

You don’t sell crypto at a loss. Or maybe next time, invest what you can afford to lose so you don’t have to sell. Cash out your initial investment and HODL the rest.

Bitcoin is a foundation, an economy on its own, a frame for a much bigger picture. If you can’t see the true potential of a future fueled by decentralized asset exchange, then it’s on you.
This is just the beginning. Banks and politicians are desperately trying to acquire as much as they can and regulate/forbid as much as they can now. They know that a Bitcoin-backed economy is a real threat to their model and hegemony, and they can’t stop it. They got to get onboard or become obsolete, a thing of the past. Bitcoin is already creating more wealth than anything else in the world.
