it's forked from dash (another scam) and was called dogecoin dark before.

if you are clearing out coldwallets predating May 12, 2014 you can also claim clams. and there was also another bitcoin fork called bitcore, that happened on November 2nd 2017 and gets you another couple of free bucks.

sry, took me forever to log back into this account. which slack channel should I go to if I'm not already too late to the party?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:48:24
pretty sure mycelium would be willing to do an ICO to implement it :-P

probably some occult stuff close to this:

yes, you are right on that. I wouldn't be surprised if this was a weird kind of publicity stunt to prop up that scam exchange.

every step towards more privacy/fungibility for bitcoin is great. thanks everyone involved for the ongoing research!
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:59:57
fair enough, hope I could be of service :)
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:24:19
lol, you didn't even google... 
@_date: 2018-11-11 07:30:11
I doubt it's a question of research/technology but rather if btc is willing to hardfork for such upgrades. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 07:16:56
wow, thanks for that info. will try to dig into it. are there any downturns if you go the softfork route vs the hardfork one to implement those features?
@_date: 2019-01-05 09:00:59
this is good for romero :)
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:51:02
going to give a try. thanks a lot dev!
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:35:38
yes, I member! :D hack was a few month after [inputs.io]( "integrated" with just-dice. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 15:37:06
lemme guess: you had no shares of carvitex, you bought into a havelock spv allegdly holding those shares, right?
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:57:09
I only had a brief look but from what I understand only ~0.39% of all kraken shares are offered. Additionally if you invest you don't really own a part of kraken but shares in a SPV (special purpose vehicle) offered by bnktothefuture (
the company itself is incorporated and registered in Cayman Islands as well as Limited in Hongkong. 
Since it's Friday evening I don't feel like going through all that stuff right now, but my gut tells me to stay away from this.

poptopnews.com? wut? :D
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:28:13
hehe, your comment reminded me of havelock investments. that site is surprisingly still in existence (more or less). :D good old' times.

I've read the last 10 comments. scary shit. I sincerely hope he's just a bored troll.
