Lol nah ima waste it 
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:08:06
What other options does one have? I’ve been told where I’m from, Michigan, coinbase is the only way to buy BTC 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:03:20
Haha for real
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:47:39
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:51:51
They will still get paid for there work, not sure if less or not when the coins cap out
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:25:32
Start stockpiling now! To the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:36:52
How did you ever get ahold of such top secret information!?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:32:16
Whatever your comfortable with, and once out put it in just leave it and slowly add monthly or weekly deposits. Long term you WILL make money, just treat like a savings account.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:44:45
Bitcoin is as valuable as people are willing to make it, can only crash if everyone cashed in their bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:55:22
I like this girl :) 
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:46:48
Was a big year obviously lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:43:11
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:10:14
Lmao yup
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:50:47
Don’t these machines work on an average? Average price of bitcoin in the past 24-48 hours.. to hard to keep up with the changing rates otherwise 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:08:31
GDAX.com links with your coinbase account very easy
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:51:01
Wow they didn’t bash on it for 3 minutes, that’s a plus!
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:02:17
Yup that’s why you buy and hodl, it’s an investment for he future 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:09:56
I don’t think it did 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:15:20
So you should be a millionaire then if you’ve been here since 2011 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:15:12
Wish I would of seen your post yesterday lol. Just placed a buy order 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:21:04
So how are people getting bcash given to them? What am I missing 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:43:05
If you think bitcoin has picked up pace this last week, cue crazy laugh, you haven’t seen anything yet 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:22:37
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:14:10
Duly noted
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:26:55
Just do some research!!
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:45:06
Bought a coin at 7k and I’m now buying monthly and will hodl for many many moons 
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:43:29
I use bread and like it quite a bit, simple wallet and very effective
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:31:45
If you sell you lose money. Hold you lose nothing
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:50:01
Fuck yeah 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:53:47
We all know he’s talking about bcAsh
@_date: 2018-09-07 02:07:59
Sometimes it’s the opposite made a purchase recently with 15 percent to my benefit because the company was going by the average 48 hour price average 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:48:32
Hahaha yup
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:39:56
Comes down to wether you believe in bitcoin or not, I for one believe in the technology and what it can do for the world. So I’m gonna keep buying and hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:40:55
Hell yeah
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:42:11
Tax only comes into play once you withdraw your coin back into fiat money. Then you are taxed based on your gains. America here
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:25:16
You must not know Andrew yang's policies lmao
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:49:14
Well whomever you support just make sure you do some research before casting that ballot.
@_date: 2019-08-11 12:42:45
He didn't buy the dip
@_date: 2019-08-11 12:44:13
Come on wheres the Bernie love!
@_date: 2019-08-11 12:55:47
Definetly dont want someone insane in the White House. Would be disaterous
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:42:00
Do it! No such thing as a bubble!
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:02:54
Only 3 percent of the world knows or is using bitcoin.. we still have some room to grow
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:28:42
Yeah that gets expensive 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:54:29
It’s sooo easy, not instant, but very easy.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:25:18
More bitcoin!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:11:14
Use it like a savings account and slowly keep making deposits over the year and do not sell, in a few years you’ll have more money then you put in
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:04:22
Our buy wall will push thru! Hodl!! Hodl!! Hodl!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:53:35
I say no personally, I use coinbase and store on my vault. Moving to a wallet cost a small fee and is a pain. I trust coinbase with my money, some other exchanges I wouldn’t say the same. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:23:19
Just wait, servers were flooded, my transaction from my vault to my wallet is doing the same thing. They will come through 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:03:44
Always does
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:05:08
I’m purchasing 500 worth monthly and as of now have just over a full coin, plan on doing this for the next 5 years before thinking about cashing anything out 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:15:32
Now you got it!! You will make a fine hodlr!
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:10:04
So when could something like this be implemented and who makes the decision too do so?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:07:24
So you sell and have cash in your hand same day? What marketplace do you use? I use coinbase and always takes a few days, I’m linked to my bank account 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:29:00
This guys great
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:04:07
But at the next dip I wouldn’t buy unless it was at least 9K. My .02
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:02:28
Keep buying on the dips and eventually you will have a coin, never sell unless your day trading 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:44:07
Just go for it! I just bought half a coin, let’s fight right thru to 20k!
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:18:54
Haha man I hope he is still hodling strong!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:58:03
It’s gonna be great to see all this unfold 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:37:45
I can’t stop watching this 
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:48:31
I just bought all my grow supplies with bitcoin! Legally from growhouse.com lots of vendors are accepting it and i love using it for my business as much as possibleplus usually ppl give incentives to use bitcoin like 20% off or something 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:51:45
Or buy
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:36:08
Gotta communicate with the masses, she did great
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:31:29
Here ya go mate, take 2 
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:36:34
I'm In!
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:43:11
�� why switch trains when this ones moving well?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:50:07
Why is it useless as a store of value?
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:05:13
More than one use of the word again, dosen't necessarily mean you're returning
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:40:49
If your calling BTC crap why you lurking here again lol?
