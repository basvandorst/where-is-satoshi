Nah.. needs to be white dudes looking to get rich ripping people off. Had they been white folk buying organic meat with their neighbors to save money, then they'd still get the SWAT treatment.

-- Texas 
Long story short... organic foods, 1 step short of terrorism!  Steal other people money... eh... everyone makes mistakes, can we give you a fist full of money to help you recover?

I took this to mean that they asked for SSN on the form and you didn't provide it.
KYC is mandated for all US banks and they've added USD denominated accounts recently, so they must be licensed as a form of bank now. As opposed to before when they were simply a money transmitter buying and selling bitcoin. 
It makes sense that they would be automating their KYC requirements as they grow in size. So, if they don't have a SSN or EIN on file for an US account, I would expect it to eventually be frozen/closed. (As in they ask you to remove your funds)

I'm amazed that contract didn't even last 90 days before it was drained through a known exploit.  After all of their "the contract is everything," now, they're asking the infrastructure to hold hostage what was taken in accordance with that contract?
So, essentially, they're proposing to ask people to rely on an infrastructure that will be driven by the lowest common denominator of the users who are using it.
It would be nice to see the person who drained that contract take them to court for failure to perform according to the stated contract. It would be a good test of the concept of their version of smart contracts.  Either it is, or it is not, all contained in the code. If the contract is entirely contained in that specific piece of code... then there was no "hack," only a person using the code as published and who now rightfully owns the siphoned ETH.

Without a social security number (or an EIN for a business), I'm surprised that you have any access to buy/sell at all. They need the social security number to comply with "Know Your Customer" laws for private individuals. It would be that way with any bank in the US.

Yeah... ethereum has just gone full paycoin.  The hard fork is to replace the bytecode of the original contract.  If they do that, then why in the world would anyone make a DAO ever again?  The soft fork will lock up all the ETH held in ANY contract that cloned from that parent. That included people who had NOTHING to do with TheDAO... sound like when Paycoin had all those hashlets locked up waiting for some magic to happen and release them to be sold.  
The response of the ETH community in pushing this hard fork has made ETH yet another alt-coin run by kids who have no clue but fully believe that real businesses will be rushing to join them in the future.
I started looking at ETH two weeks ago as a transport infrastructure for a project... I had no interest in these DAO things. This hack has saved me a lot of wasted effort because when it gets dropped from trading there won't be an infrastructure there to use.

Its a convince charge. If BTM were on every corner, the fees would be drastically lower. But, right now, one BTM machine vendor is saying that once a BTM gets into swing (around $20k USD/mo) ... the machine pays for itself in under 9 months.  So, that operator may be trying to pay for their machine faster than most or they may be paying to have the machine placed at the location. 
If you think about the ATMs that charge a $3 fee to take out ANYTHING... on a $20 that's 15%.

It sounds like a business account with routine transactions.
In the US, individuals who transact $10k in cash in a day (so can be cumulative) have to fill out additional paperwork for the transaction.

Wow... she sort of even over-shot the Dunning-Kruger effect and just landed in a big pile of babble! It's rare that you see someone get that deep into trying to talk about something that they have absolutely no clue about.

This guy has a company that sells gold stock. Funny how everytime you hear him, "gold" is the goto solution.

I'm around day 3 of a 5 day wait. I bought around $685 and prayed I hadn't screwed up. Fingers still crossed.

I'm convinced that the 4-5 day for any transactions in the US is because banks are using that money as a float pool to shore up their mandated cash reserves. It's possible that enough EU people were asking "WTF?" that the banks felt pressured to not use those funds that way.

If I understood a video by aantonop .. that address will be for ALL dao derived contracts, not just TheDAO... so, they're blocking people who have nothing to do with TheDAO except for that fact that they had the misfortune to clone from the same parent contract when they decided to play around with it.  Worse, they have NO idea of how many ETH are involved in non-TheDAO contracts, yet any hard fork is going to sweep them all into the recovery contract.

KYC allows alternate forms of ID. Check with coinbase's help desk for what forms of ID they'll take.  Not everyone in the US has a drivers license. Do you have any form of government ID?  Most government IDs are acceptable (e.g. passport, military ID, etc)

The exact vulnerability was published back on Jun 9th and slock.it didn't feel a need to react to it.  So, there's no reason to not republish now, since it was known for a couple weeks before it happened.

For a company claiming 700k customers, their web site looks like something a high school kid would put together. They show no signs of being licensed in the US because if they were, certain states require statements to be made on their web site regarding their licensing information. I don't know if they require you to provide ID or any kind, but if they don't that is another significant sign that they're not licensed.  (In the US, to exchange between USD and bitcoin requires licensing.)

If corporations can pull a double-Irish with impunity in the US... I don't see how the person who exploited this capability in the contract can be held accountable for a crime.
