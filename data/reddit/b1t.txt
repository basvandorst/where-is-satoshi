fucking cheap trolls paid by whales to dumbfuck newcomers

whales hire trolls to spam the sub with idiotic meme. I am not an investor, I user crypto for several years but recently it has become a trash sub. Fuckheads all over

I am selling almost every day 1-10 bitcoins on localbitcoins.com and people who deposit me in my country, later send money to their own countries in Asia.
So I really advice EVERYONE HERE: go to your country's section on localbitcoins.com and if you see that there are no ads buying and selling small amounts at reasonable prices bitstamp +- 3%, just fucking put your two ads there, don't wait for good guys to come and fix the world for you. This how we'll get Western Union to start working with Bitcoin, not by complaining on reddit.
FYI: you don't have to update ads every time price changes, you can set up the price dependency of bitstamp, mtgx etc and of currency exchange rate. Also put 10 dollars lower limit, there are many people who want just to try out, see what it is.
