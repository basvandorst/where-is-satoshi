As a day trader, I like HODLers
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:34:28
More like Kia

You got in way too late lol. People promised you lambos?
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:12:40
You’d be surprised on how many people still don’t know what crypto currency is. Just need more suckers to invest without doing research. Establish FOMO

I want it to keep dropping so I can buy Low again. I sold 15 at 18k
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:07:46
Don’t HODL, people will make money off you 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:34:23
Keep dropping woot!!!! 
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:50:19
The addiction is real 
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:41:51
Naw fam, HODL till you WODL
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:09:05
Yep. All those people trying to get you in during the climb fucked you over. It was the FOMO that got a lot of newbies in 
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:34:53
You don’t. You have to take risk to get anywhere in life 
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:15:32
Please! I need to buy back in! Sold at 11.6
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:06:05
Guys all you have to do to get the price to rise is to get new people into bitcoin. Promise them that they will get a Lamborghini if they just HODL for a year or two. This gets people to buy so I can continue to buy Low and sell high. Thank you 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:52:31
The only way it goes up is if people buy into this thinking
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:07:02
Hope so! Sold at 11.5

Keep on dropping! Trying to get back in 
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:11:48
Shits too volatile for me to get back in right now 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:46:09
Ain’t nobody got time for that
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:36:59
Isn’t that what HODLing is?
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:20:19
Nice job man
