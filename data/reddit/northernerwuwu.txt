The "bespoke insurance product ..." bit means that they are willing to tailor an insurance policy for a specific situation. This is an advertisement for their willingness to create such a policy and not a description of that policy.
Basically this is the equivalent of Lloyd's saying that yeah, they'll insure your singing voice if you want but they'll have to do some work to come up with a price.

Oh, I wasn't thinking you had ever claimed otherwise. Just clarifying it a bit for people that apparently are cherry-picking clauses out of the description as if it were a policy.

The guy that owns the business I work for asked me about bitcoins this last week. My co-boss I guess.
I'm not young by any means (knocking on fifty) and he's closer to seventy. I explained the thing. His first reaction was "HA! So, kinda like BreEX?"
My guy made money off BreEx (as did many) even though it was silly. Bitcoin? From what I am hearing, going to go up and cRAZY so.
I don't know. The crash is going to be bad.
If a soverign state steps up aand offers same same no "I can use this to kill people" we win. Not we as in me since I like freedom but what3ever.

I'm not the one claiming that BTC has a static inherent real-world value. In fact, I imagine you agree with me on this.
Still, if you wish examples of real world things with inherent value then there are many. Land, capital that produces goods, food, drink, labour... I mean, it's not a short list. The *price* is always derived but the value is not.

Who knows at this point though? That might cause potential investors to think they've already missed the boat and can just wait for the next crash.
I think we are looking at a period of low volume and (relatively) low changes in price. Wait and see seems to be the general sentiment.

Don't worry, it's cumulative so it's less transactions every day according to the trend!

Not to be that guy but the real-world value of Bitcoin is clearly derived, not inherent.

Don't get too excited. Our Senate is largely ceremonial and our present Prime Minister is far more likely to regulate the hell out of something than to have a "light touch" regarding anything that might conceivably compete with his corporate backers.

You can barely see them because you intentionally selected a misleading scale. A disjointed chart would show that they are very large movements in magnitude but instead you've chosen to make them look small in terms of pixels. Assets are not shown on a log chart unless you are trying to shrink the y movements dramatically.

Reports will say whatever gets them attention of course but no matter how you look at it, the market for BTC and crypto in general certainly isn't very rational right now. The bottom could be zero, the top the moon and the market can and will remain irrational longer than any individual can speculate.

I was not attempting to say that they are exchanged at equal value but rather was pointing out that when one pairs USD (as a symbol) with CAN it is jarring. Although "CAN" is used rarely, the standard initialism is "CAD" and **that** is the equivalent to USD.

Well, ATM fees and service charges have gone up steadily since their introduction actually. I'll grant that consumer *do* feel cheated but typically the convenience factor outweighs that and the cost of entry keeps competition from jumping in too quickly.
Most people won't use an ATM in a bar for example but there are enough that do to make it more profitable to gouge a few people than to offer a more 'fair' service to more people.

Well, in political speak the spectrum is (personal) freedom on one end and (public) security on the other. Increasing one of necessity decreases the other.

Prosecutors have a lot of latitude and likely far too much power when it comes to choosing to charge pretty much anyone for pretty much any reason. I would not be so sure that they felt they had a strong case against Aaron but they certainly did feel that they could take it to trial and send a message. I couldn't be more opposed to how they handled matters.
There is little doubt that the modern law is crafted to leave prosecutors incredible amounts of freedom. Almost any activity is potentially criminal to at least the point of a trial and those without the resources to properly defend themselves are essentially at the mercy of the police and prosecutors' office. It is horrific really.

It *is* an odd definition though. 
'Spam' in other sectors definitely has a purpose, simply one that is only of benefit to the issuing party in an open informational transaction. The parties that bear the resource costs are not the parties benefiting and while that marginal gain is small, engaging in a large number of transactions results in a worthwhile gain for the spammer.

Chargebacks are non-trivial but not exactly a big issue.

Four or more times the year-on-year GDP growth of the United States for well over a decade.
I mean, I'm hardly the only one predicting that China and India will have the biggest world economies at some point in the next two decades. They have the most people by far, it shouldn't be shocking even.

Well, in this particular case though if becomes true if enough people accept that assertion. That doesn't make it ethical or valid or anything else but the motivation is pretty clear.

Hey, someone went to all the trouble of starting a disingenuous astroturfing thread here and all you can do is criticise. Bitcoin is going to $3k on this news and you will miss out!

Alternately, you can always just stop updating it of course.
Hey, if you've found one you like and trust then excellent! I've just never had issues with old builds.

I mean, someone comes in and has dinner and then goes "yo, I'd like to pay with BTC" and the server goes "k". What happens next?

It's used for boats, countries and occasionally computers quite traditionally. It also might well be a language thing of course, lots of French people for example use he and she based on how it would be in French.

The average bitcoin user will continue to do exactly what the average bitcoin user has always done. They'll convert fiat to BTC, make a purchase, assess the fees involved and decide if they'll use it again in the future. If they are getting value from that above and beyond the fee structure (say in terms of perceived anonymity) then they'll use it again. On the other side of the transaction, most will receive BTC and immediately or soon after convert it to fiat. No real magic there either.
Now. If that's the end game then so be it. Some think it shouldn't be and some don't give a single fuck about 'should' and are happy to horn in on paypal et al and gain value just on the transactional aspect.
We tend to obsess about details but the average user simply gives no fucks at all. They just want something that won't change in value *too much* over the time it takes them to complete a transaction and they sure as hell aren't holding or 'investing' in crypto.

So it is a button you can use to settle the tab.
How would you actually collect the payment though or is that still something pending?
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:45:00
You can carry as much as you like on planes, you just need to fill out the paperwork first. I mean, that or use a draft, cheque or wire like everyone else.
I'm greatly in favour of crypto for a whole host of reasons but there is absolutely no point in trying to solve problems that people don't have.

The idea of a sovereign data haven is nothing new. It goes back either decades or centuries depending on your definitions.
No attempt so far has been allowed to even really test the waters though and I can't imagine a modern one would fare any differently. Until you have a method of securing your rights (like, an army and/or historical precedent to lean on) best of luck.
Laws are only as useful as a nation's ability to enforce them domestically and defend them internationally.
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:55:42
Nice edit. I can post the regs for inside the U.S. if you like, they are less restrictive actually.
Bitcoin is an excellent tech. It isn't needed because you can't fly with cash as you originally stated.

And then what?
America has already shown many times over that it can and will interfere in other nations and even relatively established ones (NZ, Iceland, Eastern Europe, the Phillipines etc) so I doubt they'd flinch at a newly created technically-legal-but-whatever state.

Your customers are though in reality. People get pretty pissy if they can't pay with what they consider to be 'standard' methods and it will cost you sales.
I'm not saying that is how it *should* be but it certainly how it actually is.

Are you thinking just from a legal standpoint?
Just curious as most banking these days is country-agnostic unless you are concerned about sharing information with the United States. And, while that is a real concern, there are plenty of options.

That is terribly dangerous however.
@_date: 2013-10-03 22:43:05
Well, given that the business longevity was extremely questionable (apparently with some cause) I'd have to say that any valuation higher than cash-on-hand was pretty risky. Even that would be wrong it seems though as that cash was subject to seizure!

Isn't 0.15BTC quite a bit? Seems like it might want to be a bit more granular.
I mean, in comparison to buying reddit gold as an example.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:10:48
You see, that's the tricky bit though. You acted as if you owned that 100% when in reality (and legally) all you had was a binding promise from the government for €100000 and then a claim against the bank for the rest. 
Now, 'the rest' is quite a bit of money and you had good reason to believe it was pretty safe but the very reason it was paying well above market returns was that there was some risk. Risk of losing all of it. Instead, you will likely lose 80% of that portion and while I *completely* understand being pissed off about it, you can't say that you weren't warned about the possibility of this happening.
It is somewhat similar to people being pissed off when a stock goes down or a mortgage goes underwater. It is often just a misunderstanding of the risks involved in pretty much every financial transaction. Nothing pays anything without some risk and figuring out your tolerance is difficult.

Ah, fair enough then. He certainly has considerably more cause for anger. Exchanging risk for services is less pleasant when that risk goes badly.
Still, I guess it all boils down to people thinking that money in a bank is safe when evidently it is not. Obviously the banks have a vested interest in making it seem so and through the power of confidence it generally even *is* but there is risk in every exchange of goods or services. 100k was the amount the governing bodies were willing to socialize out of that risk. If you need more than that for day-to-day, you'd be better off buying bonds and using them as collateral on a line of credit for payroll and expenses. More expensive but safer.
Now, I absolutely support banking law changes to make it more safe but what else can be said? This isn't the first bank ever to fail and it won't be the last. Businesses will fail as a result and that just sucks. So, let's work on changing things! (For full disclosure, I'm Canadian and our banking regs *are* more restrictive than many places. Less profits during booms but better weathering of the crises that are inevitable.)

So hostile! Ha!
Look, alarm bells should go off because apparently there might have been a problem. Hey, look! There was!
Seriously, you are calling me an idiot for pointing out that many people saw this coming? You know, the thing that **was** coming?
I'm not without sympathy here but come on... people have been talking about a possible Cyprus bank crash for a long damned time now. People knew the guaranteed amount was €100000. *Keeping more than that in an account there was thought to be risky.* Evidently this concern was valid.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:28:14
To what end though? WU is just fine using USD as it is.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:53:13
Well, even if I conceded your points (I don't) then you still have a problem. You **gave** your money to the bank in return for a **promise of more money**. More money than other people would give you. That's when alarm bells should go off.
As security you got nothing more than a promise that they'd try not to lose it and a note saying that the government guaranteed the first 100k. You gave all of it to them anyway because you wanted that 'more money' thing. If it had paid off, no one would say you didn't deserve that return. Since it didn't, few people have much sympathy.
If you thought there was a 100% chance that you couldn't *lose* on your wager then were are a fool. Parted with your money.

Yep, it is the eternal problem and why many people vehemently hate Paypal. All the big exchanges and online merch listings just straight up side with the buyer. It means that legitimate buyers can be fairly confident that the sellers they see are honest brokers but boy does it screw over sellers that get scammed.

Well, most of the lunatics aren't *using* bitcoin, they just have some and want them to be worth a lot more.
I've been an advocate for digital currency for a couple of decades now and even I am still not sure that bitcoins are the answer. I actually think it likely that they are a transitional product.
Still, I'll be thrilled if I am wrong and the system does actually get widespread adoption rates. It won't happen because of a bubble though and praising (or condemning) it with an agenda is way too obvious to be successful.
