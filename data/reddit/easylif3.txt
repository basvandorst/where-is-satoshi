LN would be possible without SW. But SW fixing transaction malleability makes LN easier to implement.

Yup, this is exactly what I just did. Now to wait for the sat/byte to go down a bit. Not keen on paying ~5% of the amount I'm transfering in fees :) Thanks

In the meantime, if you're not trading actively/often, install a wallet on your smartphone/pc and send your coins to it. Make backup of the wallet and you're safe.

No one knows for sure at this point in time. Bitcoin was built with the idea of all the participants reaching some kind of a consensus to make changes, and have some economic incentives.


No employees, there's no one company behind bitcoin. There are [Bitcoin Core]( developers who are the engineers behind the protocol. Then there are developers and businesses, who make wallets, exchanges, other services,... There are miners. There are users.
Everyone and anyone can contribute to making [improvements]( which can be adopted if enough participants decide to follow the rules.


Nothing. People will use whatever is most convenient, easy, secure, financially rewarding.


It can't. It needs scaling solutions and segwit is one step in that direction.

No, they don't have your private keys. Make sure you have the backup phrase written dow somewhere (a safely stored paper for example).

When you send someone bitcoin (make a transaction) and it gets included into a block (the block gets mined), it's done and irreversible - you can't undo a transaction once it's confirmed. Be careful not to send to a wrong address (always copy-paste addresses, don't type them out). You can see every transaction ever made by everyone in the world using bitcoin.
Here is one transaction:
The tx id is in the url itself.

Wow I must try this simple "life-hack".

I think it's a great idea, however you do need a person who is a bit technical, who would handle a wallet, know the basics of how bitcoin works, etc... Long-term, in my opinion, receiving donations in bitcoin is the way to go. But short-term, if you need liquidity and the donations are necessary to keep the organization running, it's risky because of bitcoin price volatility.

I think the confusion for a lot of people is because of the name bit*coin*. Think of it as bit*money*. You can buy 0.0386104 bitcoin for ~$104, then send someone else 0.0271 bitcoin, leaving you with 0.0115104 bitcoin, which you can then exchange back into ~$31, etc...
You can trade with fractions of bitcoin, without ever having to use 1 whole bitcoin. 0.00000001 bitcoin (1 satoshi) is the smallest amount.

The articles don't go into specifics why this is considered money laundering.
Except maybe this:


So, I guess bitcoin trading itself wasn't the cause for investigation and charge, but rather that they suspected him getting the money with some other nefarious/illegal means in the first place

Creepy shit. Just how much is someone's life worth risking for?
