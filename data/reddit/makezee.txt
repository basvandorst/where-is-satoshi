Do your thing and let the world find you. There is no "crypto UX" to speak of or improve on such a general basis.   Imagine i asked " I want to improve the internet UX, who do i contact"  Doesn't make a ton of sense right?     Do you have particular improvements in mind? Would be interested to hear what they are and where you would like to see them implemented.  Only then can someone point you in a direction.

Gotta kill that 1 month lead time.  There are several services you can use that will print on demand and drop ship to your customer.  Usually in 3-5 business days. Many small bands/artists use these kind of services because they are in the same boat as you in regard to not being able to hold inventory.   I have to imagine similar services exist for your other products.

My feedback and advice.
Get a real domain name.
Kill the need to sign in/make an account.
If you are only accepting Bitcoin, the price should be in Bitcoin.  No harm in having a reference currency, but having only USD is just strange.
Find something of substance to sell. I know you are early, but you need to sell something people want, and ideally you have some exclusivity to. The Bitcoin aspect should only sit on top of that, not attempt to prop it up.
I find myself hating the "stockbroker" email address. Feels douchey, not sure why.

I would consider taxes in the category of things i pay for being included in the larger service.  One would think that if the for profit interest has something that you want it would generally be up to them how to charge for it.  If one decides that charge is unfair they would logically seek an alternative. If there was no alternative, one would use some manner of force to take the item from the abusive power, or resolve to not have the item. Markets generally correct for abuses.  That being said, i once i had to pay to use the toilet in Germany. That was weird.

They are where they have always been. On the bitcoin blockchain.  I believe you are actually looking for the private keys to access them.  Post any detail you can possibly remember.

Yeah 2010 felt very early.  Private key would be something like E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389_SAMPLE_PRIVATE_KEY_DO_NOT_IMPORT_F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262
In 2013 i would think you would be using something like an Electrum wallet. Again stored only locally on the PC, unless you actively backed it up somewhere (cloud storage/usb drive, paper wallet).  
Happy to put my sleuth hat on and see if i can turn anything up, but i would not expect much
:edit:  upon further review it looks like you very likely never held the private keys for 50btc.  they approximated hash power and gave you an IOU for that amount of bitcoin. You likely had an opportunity to withdraw/payout but that is not possible anymore.  So if you never withdrew, they are gone, and never really existed anyway.   Only way to get what is owed to you would be to find the operators of the site and shake the coins out of them.

You already pay for basically everything, its just a matter of it being included in a larger service you pay for or being an explicit payment.    One would hope that things like micro payments could greatly increase the granularity of purchases and ultimate provide a better experience for the customer.   When you go to a hotel your access to certain doors (main entrance, room, pool, etc) is included in the price you pay for your stay, is it not?  What if you could choose to pay less and not have pool access.  Might be a good thing, might not. Only time will tell.

Bitcoin is public key cryptography.  There is no getting anything off of it, but rather obtaining, maintaining, releasing, or transferring control of keys.  Its kind of a weird thing to try to wrap your mind around.  The various devices are just ways of doing those things without having to manually type out keys, or remember keys, or trust keys, or verify keys.    As such, the device vendors have built in safety nets for when the device fails, gets stolen, etc.  But it is not integral to the inherent control of the keys.      hopefully i rambled that coherently

Some manner of agreed upon and significant fee to be put in escrow somewhere at the time you wish to be a custodian of other people's funds.  If you lose people's funds you also lose this fee or a portion there of, commensurate with the loss.   Those that pay the fee can be recognized as certified or whatever.  Much like you wouldn't put money in an uninsured bank, you wouldn't but bitcoin in a non certified exchange.

not a ton fo time at the moment, but i think you are fundamentally misunderstanding how linux works.  you really shouldn't be ever doing anything /dev directly   that is a device directory (everything in linux is a file, its wacky).  anyway  you will want to deal with your mount points instead.  that is to say  /dev/root  is likely mounted simply as /    where lets say /dev/root/home  or /dev/home  (different distros do it different ways) is mounted as /home    so if cd to /  (root)  and use something like du (disk usage) it should start to become clear what directories are taking up space.  that is to say, simply saying the /dev/root is full is not sufficient, because every other directory is a sub directory of / (root).   if you cant get it sorted out, maybe we can so an ssh session sometime later, but it would be much better for you in the long run to  bump into the walls a bit and get a more full understanding of what you are working with.

In the traditional way of one bad apple at starbucks would rate limit the whole store (all comes from one public IP and then is NATed to devices), as well as spoofing IP just to rate limit them maliciously.    A unique (though still reasonably anonymous) device fingerprint of some sort. A way that you can only hurt yourself. I need to do some thinking on this.

If the merchant's fiat is worth 3% less the moment they cash the sale (due to the processing fees), why would they not promote a 2% Bitcoin discount, and make an extra 1%. Consumer spends less, merchant makes more. Right?  Keeping in mind that im going with how the system is supposed to work, not how it does now, or at ATH with fees exploding.

Just ICMP pinging from me to you via command line.    ISP are usually dickheads about residential customers running anything publicly accessible to the internet. Usually falls under their terms of service as a "server"(which it technically is), and when you signed up for the service, you agreed not to run a server.  With an apartment building you are likely NATed behind an edge device as well.  Think of like trying to a server out of a hotel room. You dont have a real internet connection

I couldn't see how that would work, you would need the port forward on the other side of the VPN.  At that price, i dont think they would really let you get into the meat of their networking system like that.  Did you try snipping the zip tie and looking for the password on the back?
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:18:59


Yes, that is correct. Your router (the only thing you have full control of) is not getting a real public ip. So your opening of ports is not yet useful.   You need to forward 8333 on the fusion 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.3.

if they wont give you the login, you can try to find default creds online. If you cant get into that fusion box you cant forward as you need to.  Think of that fusion box as another router on the network, it has a firewall and port forwarding just as yours does. By default every port will be closed.   is there any kind of model number on it?  FCC ID is less useful but usually there somewhere
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:08:49
certain that is your correct public ip?  Its not responding to pings or anything on any port.   If correct, its likely an ISP issue upstream. If i trace route to it there is a bunch of Hotwire communications devices in the way with 170.250.254.x addresses.

So you are a 10.0.0.x of some some sort -&gt; 10.0.0.1 (router) -&gt; 192.168.1.1 (modem)?
To make anything happen you will need to forward 8333 on 192.168.1.1 (modem) to whatever the lease on the WAN side of the router is (lets say 192.168.1.2), then from WAN side of router to device  LAN side of router (lets say 10.0.0.2).   Assuming the ISP is indeed blocking nothing.

Most likely you are getting bounced around a fiber data center and one of or more of the devices in between are not forwarding traffic on 8333.  If you can get a competent person at Hotwire on the phone they will confirm this, and tell you running a server is against the usage policy, and to go away  ha. Your apartment building also very likely has an edge device (that you dont have access to) that would need 8333 open/forwarded for this to ever work.    ::EDIT::  Pings die at 170.250.254.46 in Hollywood FL

I didnt make it all the way through yet, but yes, that is more or less what im talking about.  Glad someone has laid it out so well in a white paper.  "Introducing some form of penalty to non-cooperating nodes and giving incentives to cooperating nodes may improve performance and ensure security in MANETs."     Decoy Node says to other nodes "hey this client tried to use me just now, rate limit it to 75%"    "Just tried again, 50%"  "100 times in the last hour, 0%, dont honor connections"    It would be pretty well self sustaining, i believe.
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:35:01
Decoy nodes and rate limiting.  Utilizing a decoy would rate limit you to all of the real nodes (and decoy nodes).  That is to say, the decoy node would send a message to all the other nodes to say not to honor connections from this client for some amount of time.   Decoy nodes could log repeat offenders to time them out indefinitely.

While there is no specific policy on installing bitcoin miners in your lab (understandably so), they would likely widen the nature of the offense until it constitutes a violation of a policy (or law). Then take the appropriate action for violating that policy.  That is to say, i can just about guarantee that your locality has laws against utility theft, and you would certainly be engaging in that by using the utility (electricity) for personal gain without express consent of the utility customer (even then, the utility company likely forbids sharing or reselling the utility in the ToS). Probably best case you have to pay for the usage, worst case could be a whole lot worse.

You are essentially referring to security by obscurity. Just because a 64 character string looks more difficult/secure to you does not mean it is.  From a technical standpoint it really makes no significant difference. It is an encoding scheme nothing more nothing less. That being said it is absolutely easier to beat 12 words out of someone than to beat a 64 character string out of them. Of course most bank accounts only require beating a 4 digit code out of someone.  If there's a new way, ill be the first in line.
::also, there is no requirement to use a seed phrase. You can absolutely choose to not remember it or note it down, and instead have your private keys tattooed on the inside of your colon if that feels more secure to you. You choose your own security posture, for better or worse.::
