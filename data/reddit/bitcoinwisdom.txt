I have no idea what the default RSA encryption is. The site uses the same encryption algorithm as blockchain, bitstamp uses. 128bit should be enough, balance of the security level and performance.

CEX.io was added on Jan 9. There is no enough data to fill the screen.

Hi, asdrweaewraewr, ssl4686.cloudflare.com is provided by CloudFlare. I have no idea when the SAN of the certificates could contain our domain. Now we are using the service which supports custom certificates. The site works well here for a while so I switch the whole site under https. I should wait for some longer. So maybe the CloudFlare node is cached still return the old certificates. it would not take long time.

Unlucky post time, MtGox is shutdown.

I cannot reproduce the issue., After installing Adblock and visit BitcoinWisdom, the Google Ad isn't showed and CLOSE AD button works well.
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:23:59
What's the browser's resolution? see  the close ad is at the same horiz position as 08:57:29, if you cannot see the trades, then the resolution is too low.

tons of tiny transaction should not be possible. because the attacker must be transfer some money or BTC to MtGox and it is easily to defence. DDOS always make the site extream slow with a lot of timeout. so it might be some other regular issue in MtGox. the login page returns 500 Internal Server Error in ajax so the page is failed to jump.

Mt.Gox WebSocket API was shutdown for long time. All of sites which is only base on WebSocket API such as clarkmoody will be stopped. My site [bitcoinwisdom.com]( went into slow mode(http mode) to receive the data, and the WebSocket API was recovery about 1 hour ago.  Now everything should be return to normal.

If you are using computer, I think it is. you could try press CTRL and scroll mouse down to zoom out.

Electricity cost is the most basic factor. the electricity cost and the Bitcoin price always goes into the dynamic balance. Of course it's one of many factors. but it is important to estimate the basic value of Bitcoin, and then estimate the target price and premium base on the market and confidence.

It uses long term linear(2016 blocks) increment and short term linear(504 blocks) increment to estimate. The estimate result is the green line in chart 'Block Generation Speed vs Difficulty'. The estimated difficulty is not always accurate especially when the hash rate is not stable, but you still could use the estimated difficulty trends to re-estimate the difficulty more accurately.

Of course, I will add the legends.

It depends on investor's character. Bitcoin doesn't have short selling mechanism. So I prefer to avoid trading in downward channel to decrease the risk.
I doesn't mean the price must be follow electricity cost, or I cannot explain how to price could be 266. I just explain how high the premium is.

In [BitcoinWisdom MtGox Charts]( I found both MtGox HTTP API and WebSocket API are still working, it returns succeed result, but no new trades is found. I guess the transaction inside MtGox is not proceeded.
@_date: 2013-06-09 09:37:22
Bitcoin price go from 13 to 266 in half a year and much higher than the electricity cost, so it is always a Bubble in long term. the attention of Bitcoin keep decrease and 2 months is not enough to go to the reliable price. May 31th is one of the inflection point of confidence.

EUR and GBP is supported now.
@_date: 2013-09-08 19:50:30
Thanks. Yes, full historical difficulty and hash rate will be added next.

Now the CLOSE AD button is as top as possible instead of fixed position.

It is in slip down channel from May 31th. Keep money and watching is better choice. [BitcoinWisdom MtGox Charts](

What's your browser? I've just tested in Chrome and Firefox, both of them works.

Many thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-02 09:27:47
You're right, I'm working on it. Thanks for feedback.

Maybe the resolution is too low, The close button is after about 620px. if I put the button less than 620px then it will overlapped with Ad, it isn't allowed. let me think how to solve it properly.
