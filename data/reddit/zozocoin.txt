I want the Public to hear it, and why do you send me a message pretending to be from Reddit saying I'm blocked from posting on You guys are trying to Rob me , Please people look at this is there anything wrong is I ask for a refund of my Bitcoins ? I deposited 6.4 Btc just a day after creating my account and I've done not more than 3 trades making 0.2 Btc , total 6.6. 
I'm requesting kraken to give me my 6.4 only and let them have the 0.2 that I earn from their site and delete my account. Any big deal here ?

Hello, Guys 
Today I have the privilege of chatting with Kraken live chat, After providing account info wait for a couple of sec the Guy come back , He said the issue is over his head he have to contact support and compliance sect, and he will update me via email,
Not more than 2 hours I received an email saying " Your Account is Locked Due to suspect fraud Activity"
 That's all what they said not explaining the fraud done on my account,
     
      Update to come

Its not a good move to hedge bitcoin with litecoin, the two always follow the same trend almost all the time.

Litecoin bag holders suffer more than btc and eth
