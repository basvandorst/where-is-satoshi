My point is that if Craig Wright hasn't done any thing in open source using his real name doesn't not prove anything, specially not that he is not SN. 
IF he is Satoshi it would actually make sense to find no activity of him using his real name on open source projects.

Yes bitcoin is like email: an 'application' using the internet. Email is a great success and I wish bitcoin follow the same path. 
Yes since the beginning of the internet so many applications other than email as been created, But email are still there! 
Why would a new use case make the other one not relevant anymore??
- Email is still using today, more than ever!
- It has evolved a lot since it's origin. Almost everybody can send and received emails, in an easy way now.
 
But the most important point, and what people are missing, is that email has almost totally replace the traditional mails.  
The mission of email was simple : allow people to send a message instantly anywhere in the world. And the least we can say is that it's a great success.
Bitcoin mission is simple: allow people to send money instantly anywhere in the world.  And it will(is) be a great success. 
Maybe there will be other uses of the 'blockchain' technology, but in any way it will make bitcoin disappear.

Right. Loging with the satoshi credential is not enough for sure to prove he is him, but would be a good step anyway.
But not being able to log in is he proof that is doesn't have the credential ( given that the account is still valid).

- "Hey Boss, Do you know where bitcoin sit relative to blockchain?"
- "Humm... good question... actually I don't"
- "Do you mind to pay me a trip to a conference in Amsterdam so we can know the answer?"
- "Sure! It's the company money anyway.. let's go there together."

Seems you don't need government money to do any of these. What prevent you to do that already?

So Electrum store the data related to all downloads (Ip, country, date, etc...) and is willing to share them publicly?? 
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:31:20
As I understand you are able to say from where and when users downloaded your wallet. Localization of users are based on the IP address I guess even if you don't store the full IP.  
How long do you keep those data? 
BTW,  if someone would have actually downloaded Electrum from a UK IP this day, you would have also shared this information publicly?
