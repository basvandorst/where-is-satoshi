Does anyone know where I can buy this individual issue?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:10:09
coinbase will not give you any of your forked coins because coinbase is a bank, not a wallet. Download a wallet and move your coins from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:19:09
If you are looking for a mobile wallet I highly recommend Copay or Breadwallet, if you want one for PC I would use electrum
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:52:01
absolutely, exodus is a great wallet if you plan on storing multiple cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:14:01
I don’t think you understand game theory very well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:10:55
move your coins from coinbase to a wallet you control would be the first step. Coinbase is just like a bank, you do not control the private keys so you do not really control your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:05:50
lol you want someone to send you money to test if it works? Do you think we are all idiots?
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:11:03
What are you on and where can I get some?
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:31:36
From my limited understanding, Lightning is still mostly theoretical at this point and is not near being able to be rolled out and used.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:54:16
Miners want to hard fork to bitcoin unlimited, which would let them control the block size and increase it how they choose. Users want a soft fork to segwit, which instead of making bigger blocks makes the stuff inside the blocks smaller, effectively doubling the amount of transactions in a single block, and enabling 2nd layer solutions such as lightning.
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:03:11
wow this looks terrible
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:14:20
He was talking about blocks not nodes
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:24:16
I want it! Thanks for the giveaway op:)
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:34:39
CB changed their policy, you need to be 18+ now.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:37:23
It’s not stolen, they forked from bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:39:54
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:39:02
you can sell through paypal and make an extra 20%
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:55:52
I buy amazon gift cards and then exchange them on paxful for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:00:40
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:50:28
Yes. I use it to buy with amazon gift cards however, not paypal. You can buy BTC with nearly everything, although you will be paying extra.

the interest rate has been lower than the infation rate for many years though, making the interest rate negative is just a more extreme solution. Just in the past year or two have the best interest rates crawled back up to greater than 2%.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:24:42
dont post scam shit in this sub
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:46:21
the majority of BOTH miners and users want segwit on litecoin, so I am not sure how they are going against the majority.
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:11:03
That's the same as asking if their is anyone way to get free USD
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:05:10
If only there was some sort of alt with a decent sized market cap currently trying to implement segwit and getting dicked on by jihan as well
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:25:32
Are you selling those bitcoins on local bitcoin or something like that? If so coinbase doesn't like that and your account might even get closed
@_date: 2017-04-20 21:33:40
Purse.io for stuff from amazon
@_date: 2017-04-18 15:52:14
Other scrypt coins aren't currently pushing for segwit:(
@_date: 2017-04-30 23:16:04
Smart Contracts, like what Ethereum has. I'm no expert on them but look up all the cool things people do with them on Ethereum, that would all be possible with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-04-23 04:08:37
You will be fine, bitcoins dont just get lost, the fee was probably too low.
@_date: 2017-04-30 23:20:14
Good things there's proof to back up that claim. Oh wait...
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:08:42
I mean this is the exact same thing as the Hong Kong agreement, I don't see what the big deal is.
@_date: 2017-04-17 16:31:11
giftcardexchange or gameswap would probably be your best bet
@_date: 2017-04-08 03:21:53
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:07:54
Wait so you thought you were getting scammed and your response is to place ANOTHER order with them?

coinbase. wallets like blockchain buy through coinbase.
@_date: 2017-04-18 00:48:59
They can watch it too
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:12:38
What the fuck do you think the Hong Kong agreement was? Just because it didn't work doesn't mean it's premise is any different.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:23:51
No it isn’t 
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:24:20
It was a joke since most people on this sub (unfortunately) have absolutely no understanding of basic economics.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:48:12
But Chinese miners are the ones making out like bandits over the community fighting and high fees, not blockstream
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:46:34
Literally everyone in the thread is telling you it's a scam. Walk away before you get screwed
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:53:26
Use a wallet that supports both bitcoin and alt coins, such as coinomi or jaxx 
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:49:07
There are no legit cloud mining services

You can't buy bananas with gold, does that mean gold is worthless?

Contact alpha bay with the txid and all the info, they should be able to refund you 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:48:06
Honestly, your best bet is to wait for segwit, because one of its key features is eliminating increasing tx fees based on inputs. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:02:13
If only there was some way we could have an off chain system that multiplied our scalability and tps while providing cheap fees...
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:31:31
That only applies to bitfinex, who should be disregarded when evaluating the overall price across exchanges.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:59:55
He already has a full million in his normal account
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:22:53
It's not horrible, people sadly on here shit on anything that isn't bitcoin. I currently have an equal amount of both and currently ETH has a fraction of the transaction fees, which makes it pretty useful at the moment.
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:00:40
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:35:19
So shouldn't somebody in theory have the private key to the eater address?
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:55:23
I just signed up 2 weeks ago, Im pretty sure they didnt change their policy since then. Mine says if I want to deposit USD I would have to verify with ID, but just ACH transferring through my bank account im good to go
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:10:31
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:56:17
 No, you don't actually own the bitcoins in coinbase, so there's no on chain transaction when you buy from them
@_date: 2017-05-09 01:42:44
none that are currently as good though.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:18:18
If you have the private key, just create a new wallet and import the private key 
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:21:40
Mycelium have come out saying they will support UASF, I would go with them

@_date: 2017-05-13 13:59:36
Interesting, I thought addresses and private keys were created at the same time, I didn't realize you could "make" one in this case without a private key and have it be perfectly legitimate.
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:44:00
No one is going to give you free money just to “see if your wallet works”

I can't wait for the iOS release
@_date: 2017-05-15 18:01:27
Think about it. If the cloud mining was actually profitable for you why wouldn't the companies just mine on their own and keep everything?
@_date: 2017-05-07 00:36:15
I am 17 in the US, I have my bank account verified with Coinbase and when I put in my info for a background check, I put in everything right except I put my age as 1 year earlier and it actually worked.
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:39:41
Yes of course you would be able to
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:36:16
Segwit will almost certainly soft fork without a hitch, as for the 2mb hardfork no one really knows at this point, it’s too early to tell.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:14:58
Coinbase vault or something similar is no where near as safe as a wallet
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:03:22
nobody knows
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:22:15
What exactly do you want to test?
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:35:51
It is a lot more profitable to mine alts, and then exchange the alts for btc
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:32:26
I do not know the answer to the first question, but miners choose which transactions to put in a block and how many, if they really wanted to they could mine blocks with 0 transactions, but they would lose a lot of money so it is not in their best interest.
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:15:47
look up vertcoin, very similar to BTC except it is asic resistant, so you can mine it with a GPU. I think its value is going to skyrocket once atomic swaps get implemented between it and litecoin
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:50:36
why is that a bad thing though?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:47:03
Litecoin may be what you are looking for. Very similar to BTC, but without a bunch of miners blocking progress
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:41:33
Coinbase theoretically lets you, but after I uploaded all necessary documentation they still haven't lifted my account restriction, haven't heard from support in about a month.
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:25:53
What in the world are you talking about dude
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:40:45
Very true, the ICO moon bubble is due to pop soon IMO. Someone on the ETHtrader sub said that EVERY single ICO that wasn’t an obvious scam trades higher than their initial offering price, even when they have no product as of yet. That’s ridiculous!
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:39:37
Litecoin was miner activated 
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:32:09
join the club
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:42:38
Why in the world would you recommend vertcoin to a newcomer?
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:55:08
A soft fork does absolutely nothing to your coins, a hard fork doubles your coins, but if there is a contentious hard fork and both chains survive, the coins combined will almost certainly be worth less than they were before.
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:43:19
No wonder, you need at least 250 sat/byte right now 
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:43:36
look up rootstock and moonbeam
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:31:54
Some people that think because it has centralized development, the whole project sucks and won’t amount to anything, yet if BTC had centralized development coins would be worth a hell of a lot more than they are now

Coin.dance vanity address
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:51:07
Not really, mainstream (in the btc community) adoption of lightning is still a decent way off, while sw appears to be right around the corner
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:44:02
rootstock, moonbeam, Im sure others will be developed in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:47:26
dont forget rsk, ln, and moonbeam:)
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:16:51
look up electrum for pc, or breadwallet for mobile
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:30:26
yes that is definitely a very real possibility, however with Segwit2X it is looking less likely every day. Once segwit gets activated, there is some great technology on the horizon to provide scaling:
2mb blocks (controversial topic but imo they will be necessary eventually)
Lightning Network
Schnorr Signatures
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:29:20
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:51:44
Can you show us the transaction id?
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:40:47
Other cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:17:27
do not use coinbase, get your own wallet.
Computer: Electrum
Android/IOS: Breadwallet
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:51:20
Honestly I think that is what is already happening. We will see if Segwit2X can save or gain back some marketshare
edit: you said in the meantime, but LN is nowhere near close enough to be ready for adoption, so none of these proposals are coming soon, except maybe rootstock.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:17:43
I’m not in disagreement, but ETH can still do more tps currently than bitcoin, plus unlike lightning, raiden is nearing implementation
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:21:28
I hope it does, but realistically it will probably fail
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:23:58
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:40:38
Right now it’s actually pretty low
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:12:14
What does any of this have to do with a stuck transaction? You know bigger blocks wouldn't solve your fee problem, you would need segwit for that.
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:13:06
the miners are the ones profiting from the gridlock though...
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:55:14
You got downvoted because this is just another post whining about high tx fees and there's not going through, plus its an unspoken rule on reddit that people that whine about getting a few downvotes are going to get a lot more, it's just meaningless internet points.
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:35:24
How many satoshis per byte? the fee is sort of meaningless when we don’t know how large your transaction is 
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:07:32
lightning payment channel =/= segwit wallet
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:08:30

You should totally be able to buy your coffee with it, make it happen off chain.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:46:00
Well, most people that are against a block size increase say that we should try to keep onchain as small as possible, so everyone in the world can run a node. People in 3rd world countries and even people with poor internet in america wouldn't be able to run a node if the block size increased (at least not at the moment), so bigger blocks would inevitably lead to centralization of the node network. the... fanatics say that a block size increase leads to control by the Chinese government, since all the big mining pools are under control of the Chinese gov. I personally support a block size increase, but I support off chain scaling a lot more.
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:28:58
Do Schnorr Signatures require a hard fork, and if so what other features should core look to jam in to that so we wont have to go through another one for a while.
