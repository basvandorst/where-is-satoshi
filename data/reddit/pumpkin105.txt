* chose what I want to drink at starblocks
* copied the lnt code
* pasted it into the htlc at `enter payment request`
* clicked `Send payment`
and then a red box was shown but before I'm able to read it the site reloads. Same procedure happens every time I'm trying to pay

But shouldn't 0.17 be more recent than 0.17rc4?

How come there was a 0.5.2-beta, but no 0.5.2 release? Is it because all their releases are beta?
