The ethereum network wouldn't be able to handle that many tx's.

Bitcoin's true success will be mass adoption and if that ever happens we need the average person to be able to buy without the need of understanding the technology behind it.

He did call a hit on a couple people using a contact that was actually working for the FBI.  Don't think they could prove that in court though since it was all through TOR.

Good luck leaving Coinbase with your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:42:37
Bitcoin is not successful because it scales well.  Bitcoin is successful because it has first movers advantage.  Bitcoin was the first Crypto released and we all know that's why it's valued the most.  Not because of the state of the technology.
And with that said, how do we define success?  Is it the market cap, adoption, or something else?  All the buyers are just holding to sell.  Is that adoption?  I'd say being able to use it in day-to-day transactions is adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:16:14
Yeah it's kinda fucked up.  Who's really being attacked?
Edit:  And thread is gone...

Yep, they actually prevented him from closing the laptop by doing it like this.  Without the laptop there was still little evidence to prove that he was DPR.

I'd save the shovel analogy for Bitmain and mining.  I'd say this is more like selling personal safes for fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:54:17
The network as a whole slows down more with more useers and everyone who has to pay fees pays higher fees...
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:15:59


Only running a full node has impact on network security, transaction validation, and voting. That is, a node that contributes hashpower.  Otherwise, you could spring up a thousand plus nodes and attack the network.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:24:34
I appreciate your time and insight!  This gives me some things to consider.
One last question though.  If Bitcoin adopts bigger blocks, then what's stopping the hard-fork from adopting Segwit and LN?  It seems to be a game at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:31:52


It seems that way, but that can't be true.  [Forks](
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:43:15


Segwit is supposed to fit more transactions per block but even with full implementation and adoption, it is hardcapped to be equivalent to an 8mb block.  Definitely not a long-term solution.

Christmas is in 3 days.  People are selling to have money for the holidays.  It'll pick back up in the first 2 weeks of January.  Stop spreading FUD and take your head out of the sand.  It's been a single day and you're already trying to accuse something.

You'll never get through with that coinbase number.  The rare occasion that you get into the queue, you'll wait approximately 41 minutes, and then they will disconnect you.(Can confirm cause I've called them back to back 15 times and gotten through twice, which each time they disconnect me after 41 minutes on hold).

@_date: 2017-12-24 15:36:48
When it comes to software that can just be copied, there's nothing that makes Bitcoin special.  Any coin can have all the properties of Bitcoin with additions to the technology.  So why is the name even significant?  It's brand recognition at it's best.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:10:24
I want to see these posts.  Seriously.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:20:20


It's not a long-term solution for the current scaling issue.


You say it yourself here.  If the block size stays the same, the benefit of Segwit is not going to scale.
Edit:  Segwit is necessary, I don't disagree with you, and it does make running a node more efficient, but in the context of the scalability issues, it isn't the long-term solution.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:25:46
On point   This shitcoin sounds like stable coin if banks in Japan are adopting it.  Shitcoin generally has no real integration with anything outside the market.  So I would politely disagree with you calling it a shitcoin.

This looks very useful! Thanks for sharing

Lets put Bitcoin up to the same critique.  What's Bitcoin's value proposition?
     ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


Segwit has yet to show value and Lightning is a 2nd layer protocol that does not improve on the actual Bitcoin protocol(The protocol that brought us where we are today).
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:26:36
Because people feel like they are bought into something and need a reason to stay in.  With Bcash, there isn't much reason.  There I said it, bring in the downvotes.

Price adjustments in 24 hour period, jumps on reddit to say Crypto is dead.

The decentralization that Bitcoin brings to the financial world is making a big impact today.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:31:27
It’s a combination of things, not a single thing.  It doesn’t help that BTC price dropping scares a lot of people off.  And decreases the confidence in the Crypto market.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:12:46
lets resort to name calling instead of having a counter-argument.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:15:05
does complaining about high-fees and slow transactions make someone anti-bitcoin?

If you order direct from Ledger's website it's about $120 with 3 day shipping to the US.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:26:06


And what was Segwit?


How do you define which Bitcoin is the original?  By developer?
  Is it still the original Bitcoin after development passed on from Satoshi to the current dev team?


Bitcoin never been pumped? ;)
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:51:40
Nice, I was also in Ethereum, but its clear now that the market isn't interested right now.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:43:07


I never said it wasn't a short term solution?  I was implying the opposite.  It can be a short-term solution if it's adopted.  I agree with you that the long-term solution will benefit from Segwit.


They've been avoiding a block-size increase for years, and with the hardfork offering that solution, why would Bitcoin see a blocksize change?


Okay I do see how it can compound with the LN now.  But once again I'm convinced that the core dev team will not change the blocksize which is the big debate at the moment.

Let me go full tin-foil and question the possibility that another party is involved that would somehow benefit from BitCash looking guilty.  This feels too obvious.  I'm riding the fence right now so I don't care for either side more.  I'm certain will make this claim in their defense.
