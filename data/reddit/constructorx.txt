Yes they do. I have purchased from some of them. If they did not buy the Bitcoin then they could not transfer them to you wallet? So the must do.

Another aspect of possible manipulation is leverage. Look at the silver market. 159 billion ounces of 'paper silver' traded in 2016. The average spot price was $17.14. (159 billion x 17.14 = two trillion seven hundred twenty-five billion two hundred sixty million). The actual silver investment was $4.4 billion. Divide the total 'paper' investment by the actual physical investment and there is a 500x leverage.

Is the transaction considered finalised without commitment to the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:33:31
That is my point. Because this is all new territory the vary nature of what a transaction is considered to be is up for debate. I suppose that consensus will determine the final definition by how people actually decide to utilise it. In one sense performing a fast transaction on LN can be considered a transaction but purists may not consider it a transaction until the blockchain represents the correct state of affairs. Interesting stuff.

Probably also due in part to the EU wide regulatory crackdown story that is just breaking.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:21:00
How can you fight a system that can print fiat ad infinitum? Manipulation has seen the gold and silver markets get many billions of dollars dropped onto the short side in seconds. Their markets are much bigger than Bitcoin yet still get hammered down. The reports of such activities can be seen by a Google search. Only time will tell how this plays. Purposefully trying to fight shorts with a few dollars is not a good idea in my opinion.

This is not just in the UK. The new rules, which will be applied across the European Union.
Front page headline story stating that the ministers of the British Government are launching a crackdown on the virtual currency Bitcoin. The government has disclosed plans to regulate Bitcoin that will force traders in so-called crypto-currencies to disclose their identities to them. No more UK anon Bitcoin or any other coin for that matter.

Looks like a ramping up of anti-Bitcoin propaganda?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:20:34
I have. It does not matter where you buy the Bitcoin from, if they end up in your wallet they must be mined on the blockchain. They may only be reserved if they are purchased on an exchange and left on the exchange. If you move them off the exchange to you wallet they must be a 'real Bitcoin transaction' as you put it. I understand fully.
As far as your point on Coinbase and forks. If the coins are not in your wallet and in the blockchain before the fork then you miss out. Simple. Anyhow, Coinbase send out clear reminders to their customers to ensure they move their coins in good time.

I used $500 million as a conservative figure. On june 8th 2017 $4 billion notional gold futures got dumped ahead of Comeys Testimony.  31st August 2017 $5 Billion Notional Gold was dumped, this happens regularly. If a market as large as gold (and silver) is manipulated, Bitcoins relatively small market surely can be.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:24:47
No. LN is off-chain.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:27:39
$200 million, $500 million, is not a lot of money to these people. On 31st August 2017 $5 Billion Notional Gold was dumped on the gold futures market. This happens regularly.

Take a look around the comments of traders Reddit. CME markets are so much cheaper to trade on that they will move. There will be a large reduction in volume on current exchanges I would suggest.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:36:41
They are seem to be looking at every possible angle to find negativity.

So, CME Group and Cboe Global Markets create a product that enables the 'investment' in BTC, indirectly, and is fiat cash-settled. This seems to me to be less than positive. Why? Say a group invests in Bitcoin via this vehicle. The amount invested would never reach the Bitcoin ecosystem, it would never purchase coins. The money is held in a separate financial product that is linked to the Bitcoin price and is paid out in fiat. Fiat as we know can be created ad infinitum. This has the effect of controlling the price, since the amounts invested never buy Bitcoins, never reduce available coins and therefore increase price. This is similar to 'paper gold' and 'paper silver' markets are rigged, check the effects on price there. I am not saying this is 100% the case, just how the strategy seems to me. 
If a group of large investors put $500 million into an investment vehicle that is linked, but not directly invested in or used to actually buy Bitcoins, that $500 million is effectively isolated, withheld and prevented from ever reaching Bitcoin. Therefore no purchase of Bitcoin, reduction in supply, no price increase. All investments can be paid out in infinitely printable fiat. This could be the control strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:27:53
This. The problem is that many could decide to at the same time. Choose wisely.
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:59:06
Ok, that makes more sense.
If the USD to USDT rate is 0.9287 and the price is 6885:
0.9287 * 6,885.8 = 6394.84246.
Which is a lot closer to the Coinbase price of around $6400.
This whole scenario is still disconcerting.
Thanks for the answer.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:30:22
But it clearly states: BTCUSD 6,923.3
I do not understand when you say 'Price on bitfinex is not in dollars'?
As far as arbitrage, I did not know could not withdraw in fiat on bitfinex. Also the other markets like ETHUSD seem to be similarly offset in price preventing arbitrage.

So, a body creates a product that enables the 'investment' in BTC indirectly and is cash-settled (as stated in the article). This seems to me to be less than positive. Why? Say a group invests in Bitcoin via this vehicle. The amount invested never reaches the Bitcoin ecosystem but is a separate product is linked to the Bitcoin price and is paid out in fiat (cash-settled). Fiat as we know can be created ad infinitum. This has the effect of controlling the price, since the amounts invested never reach Bitcoins network, reduce available coins and therefore increase price. This is similar to 'paper gold' and 'paper silver' and the effects on price there. I am not saying this is the case, just how it seems to me. 
If a group of large investors put 500 million into an investment vehicle that is linked but not directly invested in Bitcoin, this is effectively preventing that amount from reaching Bitcoin and can be paid out in fiat. Maybe I have it all wrong. I don't know.

With gold (and silver) what they seem to do is sell 'paper gold', with an option for delivery, that the investor almost never calls for. Even if they do, a cash premium could be offered in fiat to satisfy that. The point being that if there is the possibility to print fiat into infinity, and an investment vehicle exists that positions itself between Bitcoin and institutional investors, the investment fund can absorb all the demand and Bitcoin does not grow from that investment as it never reaches the point of buying coins. It is a very good way of manipulating the price. it has been very successful in PMs.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:47:34
Yes, price manipulation. The reason physical gold and silver has not seen a huge rise. I wonder what a gold or silver ounce would be worth without the manipulation. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:41:33
At what ratio? Certainly not 1:1. How many paper ounces of gold per physical ounce are issued. Same with silver when amost a years silver output can be dumped on the paper market in a day using paper. So, what ratio? Same as the estimated ratios in paper gold and silver? Because that has been reported around 200:1
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:11:33
How? Any investment made in that synthetic product will never reach Bitcoin. It is 'linked' and paid out in fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:44:25
Yes, but how often would those people require delivery? If investment amount goes into some vehicle and these funds never reach the point of actually buying any coins, then the price has been effectively controlled.
Then there is the ratio. In theory they could sell each bitcoin 100 times, and since the investor never asks for delivery the price is suppressed.

They are hitting Bitcoin with some bad press:
"4:42pm  Dark Currency
Hospitals and GP surgeries appear to have been told to pay $300 dollars - £233 - in order to regain access to their files.
The hackers are demanding this is paid in Bitcoins, an unregulated internet currency that authorities find it difficult to trace."
That is how it is being reported in UK: 
[EDIT] Another interesting point is that any comment post (on the Telegraph link above) containing 'Bitcoin' is auto rejected.
