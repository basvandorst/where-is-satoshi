How many times are you going to repeat these thoughts? You're really going to be kicking yourself in 2-3 years

You pay your loans with your standard income monthly.  Don't fuck around with your student loan money by putting it into a crazy volatile, cutting edge investment vehicle which is at an all time high.  As the saying goes, don't put in more than you can afford to lose.  You have to be okay with putting money in that you may never get back.

I would compromise and eliminate a sizeable chunk of debt so it's more manageable and hold onto some crypto also.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:20:02
It really depends on your whole financial picture.  If you are already contributing to retirement funds and savings then yes you should probably find a little extra to place into crypto.  You should get those in order first before moving into crypto in any real way IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:25:23
Depends on the interest rate on your debt.  If it's below like 4% I would be much more likely to put it into investments while only making standard monthly payments.  
If it's credit card debt with stupid interest rates then you should pay that down first.

Gemini will let you do $1500 / day bank deposits. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:33:38
Sounds like you have way too much invested
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:38:57
Shit this might actually be the 201st and final death of Bitcoin.  Don't let that info out

No gdax is usually 2nd or 3rd in BTC volume.  Currently 4.14% of global volume.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:29:23
That's an interesting thought, could very well be.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:42:46
Because when it's still at 11.9 it's still not a sure bet. 12 is a much safer new base to buy in at psychologically. It's like popping a pimple and relieving a lot of pent up buying pressure

you can much more easily filter the crazy on twitter, even if it's terrible as a medium of communication.

Wtf is gabish?  Is he trying to be cool and use Italian? Capisce?

Yea but if they get hacked they're going to lose so much money that I just don't know if they can remain solvent and repay those losses.

You need way more than $2mil to make any major sustainable impact in the hash rate.  Magnitudes more.  
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:26:34
It's exactly what they're doing it feels like.  They need pre warmed infrastructure at all times and should not be relying mainly on auto scaling on demand.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:31:23
They have no excuse for this shit, it's unacceptable. They run a huge financial trading platform and apparently cannot pay for the infrastructure to support it.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:25:02
Seriously fucking shady.  They go down every time there's a huge market flux. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 15:46:33
Doesn't mean that is something they won't invest in as a currency.  They don't have to fully adopt it as a platform to play a major role in the spread of BTC
@_date: 2016-06-16 02:53:30
Hi, do you have a moment to speak about my Lord and Savior, Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:30:00
I'm panic buying!
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:30:01
Honestly you should put some money into savings.  It doesn't really sound like you're in a position to play with volatile experimental currency that could go anywhere.
And if you are set on playing with your money then I would still consider putting a good portion into savings
@_date: 2016-06-12 03:47:51
Everyone wants to buy it now before it really jumps when the halvening occurs.  This drives prices up.

South Korea.
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:40:46
Definitely, though I think it will continue to rally and we're going to see quite a bit more of a bubble coming up here.   People just got their toes wet with the spike and now it's cheaper and they're ready to jump in.

Banks and institutional firms make their money on their trust.  Their entire model is hierarchical.  Why do they want to focus on the fact that they are no longer the monoliths of trust in finance in an economy ruled by crypto currencies?

These are the top five countries trending for Bitcoin on google right now.

That might be the douchiest cover photo I've ever seen.

where have I heard this before?
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:44:39
Because the depreciating asset is much more stable. Bitcoin can wipe out your entire net worth in a crash or hack, while USD is insured while in a bank.  Makes sense to have multiple asset classes.

Lump sum investing
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:22:25
Fuck yea easily. Just don't take on more than you could reasonably pay back if you lose it all
@_date: 2016-06-16 03:09:25
Some day one of the best things will be the ability to use it globally when you travel too!  No more exchanging currency.
@_date: 2016-11-09 07:41:13
Yea don't even think about day trading or short term gains.  Just buy when you see opportunities and hodl

If you sold all your Bitcoin around 6500 for BCH at 350 you would have quintupled your stack in 10 days...
I still think it's a total scam run by shady people.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:28:28
Nice false equivalent.  Maybe if it was United States of America Canadian Dollars you would have a point
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:12:26
No in fact they are super reputable and actually reimbursed people who lost everything during the flash ethereum crash even though it was the traders fault.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:10:43
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:07:51
Still way early into adoption, definitely not close to mass adoption yet.  Too many hurdles to use and secure BTC for it to be mainstream right now
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:09:30
Yea just throwing some shady FUD right there by telling half the story
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:05:17
.io is a very popular new root domain for tech companies since .com addresses are hard to come by.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:49:11
In the forks we've seen previously, yes.  In a contentious fork with no replay protection there will likely only be one winner
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:07:04
Personally I would keep it there until the fork since they will implement the replay protection and split your coins for you.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:50:42
They've owned Bitcoin domain for years though so you can't make too much out of it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:27:09
Also he completely ignores the peer to peer argument at the same time.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:07:19
Bitcoin Cash is the psyop because it is trying to co opt the Bitcoin name and brand and has a league of devoted followers and paid actors trying to legitimize it so they can make billions.
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:16:37
No. People get scared shitless and take their losses and sit on the sidelines.
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:26:32
Yea but what have you done for me lately?
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:14:44
I took it as a reflection on the price, not against the usability and accessibility to general society.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:05:50
I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on ETH.  Do you have any at all in your portfolio?
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:06:48
Everyone regrets not buying more, don't worry

@_date: 2017-05-27 11:41:33
It's your ability to ride market fluctuations and take advantage of good opportunities instead of panicking and selling at a loss
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:24:54
It does seem like a fair price to trade your soul
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:50:00
They don't necessarily have balls of steel, they just have more money to gamble with.
