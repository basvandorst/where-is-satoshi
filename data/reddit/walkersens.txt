Idiot proof software is coming. It just takes time for software life-cycles to figure out what is needed.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:17:11
So did I. Maybe he didn't get the exact amount correct? I would contact LocalTill or bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:27:59
You sir, are awesome.
@_date: 2013-07-18 00:42:51
And somehow we spend enough time on here to notice. Along with the fact so few people know what a vanity address is...

I did use google authenticator, however, they don't backup your data for security reasons.
@_date: 2013-05-09 19:08:00
No idea, not my project. But the number will most likely seem really big since there is nothing to really compare it to.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:41:31
Fully aware, don't click on his 'website' either.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:59:54
It's the fact none of theses posts seem to reach the front page of I've watched the wave of trades like this with all the idiots selling right afterwards in a frenzy. Does **no one** actually look at the volume being traded? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:24:37
Agreed, but it's so much fun to watch while browsing the new subsection of this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:36:33
This is a great explanation of why its not a waste of resources. Imagine money taking care of itself to keep transaction fees to a minimum :-].
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:38:03
It really doesn't matter. If you try to sell your coins while everyone else is there isn't anyone to actually buy them. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:17:13
They just reset my two factor auth :-]. I feel soo relieved.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:02:53
If the New York stock exchange servers were to go down their would be a disruption too.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:22:52
I still wouldn't mind...
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:58:27
I had this happen before. They will reset your pin, but under current conditions it may take a very long time. It took them about a week 3 weeks ago.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:47:14
Just took it =).
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:09:46
Nice looking site. Commenting for future reference.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:55:29
Don't watch the mtgox charts if your using Bitfloor. Use [this]( instead. They have all the major exchanges at the top of the webpage.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:55:56
As stated, I'm mostly likely one.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:29:39
Do people really not use the search box?
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:08:23
I laughed in my living room while everyone else is watching a movie. No one here understands....
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:29:53
That's why I use bitfloor. It's extremely fast.
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:51:33
You're looking at bitcoins as too much of an investment. If you want to diversify your assets buy some stocks in bitcoins. The whole point of is to convey a set amount of value to another person without using central banks.
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:48:11
9 billions dollars over a decade? That's like spare change when compared to our debt.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:50:40
Yeah, bitfloor was at low $117 ~30 mins ago. It's now 128.
~ 1 min later - Correction, just shot up to 139. Damn.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:10:39
This, nothing helps more than the command line.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:51:54
I know what you're feeling. This seems to be one of those problems no one has ever had and google doesn't give a clear answer. I did post the whole scenario on a reddit post just in case the whole fiasco happens again to someone else.  
@_date: 2013-04-27 03:37:37
Guys, this is a much bigger deal than you may expect. The WC3 is like the bible when it comes to big companies wanting to stay 'hip' and 'cutting edge'. If it really does get into HTML5 in the following few months everyone's dream will happen. Bitcoin will become huge.Source: myself, programmer

Near the end, around 4:15ish.

@_date: 2013-04-03 21:22:36
Buy buy buy!
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:55:10
No they haven't. They should really implement some kind of fail safe for this situation. No worries though, im writing them a letter.
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:21:27
Sorry to tell you zip files in python are like jar files in java. Ruins everything =[. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:00:31
No worries, I browse the new section. Up-vote for you :).
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:33:30
I was about to say this. I figured it out when standing in line going, "Wait, how will they know I gave them this money and not someone else?". Then I remembered their 1 to 4 percent fee and noticed you only have a few days to deposit the money. It just clicked after that.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:23:24
I'm buying! $115 is an awesome price.
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:55:33
Sierra chart looks very promising. I'm definitively going to try it once I have more time. Thanks for the info! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:26:37
Edit - Good point, SPEND
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:57:59
Almost into my 20's. Intern as a software developer with a really expensive habit of electronics. I was in $500 at $104  because I spent the weekend prior learning everything I could about the currency. I'm not planning on selling any of my coins as well. I can't wait to show this community my cold bitcoin wallet prototype once im finished :-].
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:14:55
I'm still trying to figure it out. Hopefully Bitfloor will respond today.
