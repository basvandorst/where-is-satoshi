0% profit tax is the reason why I own this ETN. The biggest downside is the very limited open hours of the Swedish Nasdaq market.

How did you reach 5%? The ETN takes a 0.25% fee when buying and selling plus 2.5% per year.

I would like to also see a metric for how many people die and how many people get seriously injured.

I would just pick a bank, login with my Swedish national auth system ”Mobilt BankID” (smartphone app since 2011) without having to create a user account in advance. Then I open a regular bank account by accepting the ToS.
Total time if in a hurry: 30 seconds.
Edit: I’ve done this years ago.

Creating more bitcoin is possible in the same way changing block size is possible - “just“ change the protocol.

Interesting idea.

That’s easy to say now but will you really do this on doomsday? Goals/strategies are great. Unfortunately, it’s very common to not follow them and not realizing it until it’s too late.
You need to remind yourself over and over and over again about this strategy. Good luck!
I would suggest you set up several levels where you will buy and the lower the price gets the more money you spend on buying.

To be fair, you should also make a chart with only failed technologies and Bitcoin in the end.

Oh that explains it. Thank you!

How can the difficulty increase by 10%? Do they mean the average difficulty over a certain time? The article refers to “the Bitcoin network’s most recent difficulty adjustment”.
Edit: I should have added my assumption that increasing the difficulty by one bit doubles the hashing difficulty.

I assumed increasing the difficulty by one (bit) doubles the difficulty. It sounds like there is another mechanism in place to increase the difficulty with less than doubling.

“We buy the relevant amount of bitcoin and/or ether upon issuance of a new certificate which ensures that we are always 100% hedged and able to support the outstanding value of the product. “
Sounds like an ETF to me. I’ve been trading their Bitcoin certificates for a while.
It’s nice not having to care about wallet security and also nice not paying profit tax on securities (which we don’t do in Sweden). The down side is the limited opening hours of the Nasdaq OMX market.

Development is demand driven. Currently there is no urgent need for it, and therefor it’s not developed yet. The high need there is, the more focus on getting it done.
Andreas Antonopoulos explains it very well in this video:

Sure, but XBT Provider seems to be keeping up with today’s industry facto-standard with offline storage etc. I might be naive, but I’m not so sure I would do a better job for myself.
This management is costly and they charge 0.25% per transaction for this, so there’s one more downside.
