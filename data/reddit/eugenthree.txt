Just do not buy more than a couple hundred dollars or you are going to have a bad time.
EDIT: Wait a second, that is still a shitty rate.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:33:44
No, it's actually 1 BitUSD = $0.852 right now...
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:46:26
I have a feeling you aren't helping these guys.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:03:08
So you are saying it is relevant?
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:22:40
The problem is, there exists a better implementation of your featured product, BitUSD, and none of you have the courage to admit it.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:44:20


Define pegged.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:02:02
It's a shame all that scalability is going to go to waste.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:05:43
That's simply not true.
But I will just point out that at least NuBits have ALWAYS been $1.
BitUSD is never $1.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:03:17
OP was deleted because redditors give no shits about BitShares.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:50:32
It moves all over the place.  
There is no peg.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:20:27
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:20:00
Just hope we stop laughing.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:36:48
Stick to defending your failing peg.  I was just showing you a successful peg for reference.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:00:20


Funny.  That is exactly what the eDollar people were saying.
Why is NuBits the only pegged asset designed that has solved both the chicken and the egg problem?
@_date: 2015-06-09 05:23:26
Let's say a mining pool did this.  Obviously the community would have the motive to abandon the pool, which is a better deterrent than some arbitrary number.  But one must ask themselves, why would they do this?  And why haven't we seen miners even trying this?
edit - I get it.  A rogue miner could do this with an unearthly sized block for free.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:02:40
I am not doubting BTS holders meet up for coffee every once in a while.
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:05:56
Is it brand new or 2.0?  Make up your mind.
They are still $0.85 when traded with the currency you are trying to replace.
That is at least 5x higher of a fee than merchants pay to process credit cards.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:09:38
Don't we all try to?
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:39:24
Fucking Daniel Larimer needs to look up the definition of a ponzi before his disciples start spamming reddit.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:56:22
My point is, shapeshift is the only platform BitUSD is on that people have actually heard of.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:22:57
Shapeshift uses the spreads on exchanges where BitUSD is traded.
Nubits have no problem being $1.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:49:36
Point still stands.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:13:38
I honestly was not looking for a reply.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:54:54
"The topic or board you are looking for appears to be either missing or off limits to you."
I found this, though.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:55:37
A small market.
Well shit, OP said it was bigger than Visa and Mastercard combined.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:52:12
I guess I am still wondering how a block limit would help.
When transactions are dropped from the mem pool and "Bitcoin is starting to look flaky", isn't this BECAUSE of the block limit?
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:29:18


Haven't the custodians proven themselves more effective than the BTS system?
BitUSD are never $1 due to no liquidity out here in the real world.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:32:24
Find me a single point of failure with NuBits.
When CCEDK lost all of their bitcoin AND all of their nubits to hackers, the NuBit peg still remained at $1 without flinching.  Same when BTER lost all their bitcoin and exco.in lost all of theirs.
It is incredibly funny how BitUSD folks are now talking about wiring USD to that black hole of money, CCEDK.
They are running on fractional reserves until I have proof otherwise.
NuBits is making a big mistake having their custodians keep a balance there, also, to be fair.
CCEDK is run by idiots.

@_date: 2015-06-08 19:18:36
Why are BitUSD never $1?
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:43:44
How did a block limit help?
To me it only seemed to slow down confirmations.
The data was still put into the blockchain regardless.
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:18:53
The mighty dollar bubble.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:57:56
I will check out bitshares when they can hold a $1 peg.  Deal?
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:05:22
Any information about said attack?  What blocks should I look at?
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:21:35
Yes, he clearly has no idea what a Ponzi is.
I spent a good amount of time looking into it, as well as the BTS crowds defensive comments about Nu.
Just search their forum for Nu and look at all the worried children, Daniel included.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:13:38
So surely you can show me a long string of blocks that have been filled to the brim (the 0.75/1mb limit)?
Or are you saying that an arbitrary limit is all it takes to dissuade attacks?
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:10:59
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:06:04
How much time does BitUSD need to have a reliable peg?
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:10:25
Perhaps you would be wiser to research it without the hysteria about some competition, and read the NuBits whitepaper.
