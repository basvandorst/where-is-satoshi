I'm not sure what that means.  Keep in mind, it's as if I'm a preteen.

Aged account? Someone could have bought it without me knowing?

No worries. I can see how it looks shady.  My handle is "betapaul" cause I sign up for everything even if I don't use it.  I like to "beta" test things/software/anything. Thus the Bitcoin pickle I'm in!
Hmmm...I mean I put it in cause I could spare it.  SO it's not going to prevent me from feeding my children.  I just exported the private keys.  Do you have a favorite smartphone wallet?

Got it!  Now how to get it off of here...

Ah!  Yeah man, I don't spend a lot of time on Reddit and usually end up here by Googling something else. This is how I'm here now.  I know this is the place to go for the Knowledge though. 
I read through your post and it seems to have a lot of good info.  Now I just got to see if I can actually pull it off...

Thanks!  I'll give it a shot.  Are there any good online wallets? This desktop stuff blows my mind.
