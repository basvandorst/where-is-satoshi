Suck for them to lose money? you mean like just yesterday during that huge drop... Funny how they have not renamed bitcoin gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:14:17
If bitcoin is bitcoin, then what is bitcoin gold and bitcoin diamond? Hillarious, yes you are.

Cool, 1 high fee service meets another high fee service, least you get your goods on time with ebay though...

Juding by the white paper which would you say is the actual bitcoin right now? I will never understand the argument that bitcoin is bitcoin in it's current state.

I love that these cretins are so blind and so up cores arse they down vote you for a sentance making complete sense, they deserve to lose every penny .

Said it for months, seen countless posts from people saying use kraken and here I was saying do not use kraken because I lost almost everything during the ddos an they did absolutely nothing to remedy it. All I got was down voted, meanwhile kraken have done absolutely nothing to fix their service.

Stopped using kraken months ago after they liquidatrd me despite me sending several email saying I couldnt access crypto watch.  Never got a replied after the initial one which still took a whole month.

You're right there is only one bitcoin that is inline with the original white paper and that is bitcoin cash currently having to tout the cash name because core devs didn't want to upgrade the mb size for 9 years which has led to the creation of many alt coins and many better alt coins like ethereum, which could do it's own jobs and bitcoins jobs as a currency (not ponzi scheme store of value) with ease.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:14:50
So in simple terms if this had happened on bitcoin, would this be fixable quickly or would that have killed bitcoin off entirely?

You see in another comment you go on about numpties bringing you down to their level, clearly then I have been brought down to your level as I have mistakenly replied to your drivel twice. How in the world did you make a moderator on a bitcoin page... Don't reply or do, I won't reply again. Clearly too intelligent for those willing to look a bit deeper into the whole btc vs bcc subject.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:36:19
I did, mt gox took all 200 from me...
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:56:11
I made 10k one night trading ethereum, Yay for me...
Overall I lost what would have been around 300,000 usd...
Started with like 1000 eth, ended up with around a 100.

People like you read this reddit and believe all the bullshit it passes off under the guise of real information while the admins monitor and delete posts. Then you cry People like me are spreading disinformation which is simply not the case, I was a btc maxamilist until I really looked into things.  As for no techinical ability, ethereum was created by vitalik because core were not interested in his ideas. You telling me john mcafee doesnt have and ability either?  Its funny, People in bitcoin claim they're in it for the decentralisation but the lack of allowed discussion and People sticking to the popular opinion even if Its wrong shows just how centrelised people are, afterall, no one wants to be with the unpopular crowd.  It'll all end in tears. !remind me 2 years
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:42:59
I love a sophisticated reply and a down vote.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:37:07
You people are dillusional, ver n mcfee have more money than you or I could spend, why would they risk dropping the price of bitcoin for a shitcoin pnd? Have you thought that actually bcc is more in line with satoshis vision? I got into btc 2012, it was marketed as a decentralised currency free from government bullshit. Now your all palming it off as a store of value, because the network is not even close to visas transactions per second and the fees are insane. Bcc came about because core team have done nothing to improve the tps or keep fees under control. In tech space 9 years is a long time and somehing should have been sorted long before bitcoin became common public knowledge. Keep crying these people are scammers, they had the insight to be in bitcoin long before most. Downvote away, you're sheep. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:50:09
Ye that's what I thought too.
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:36:41
Another 12 hours later, still showing 0/2 on bittrex.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:56:45
As an update for any one that this might happen too, the nano ledger has a  bug that doesn't show your transaction. I had to go tools and delete app data, once it synced again it showed my balance. Worst hour of my life since Kraken liquidated me during that ddos attack...
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:31:46
I have also checked it has not been sent to the bch address either by accident.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:53:13
Explain? what is replay protection and what do you mean by double selling? as in it's selling their normal btc too?
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:29:09
Nope, it's not been received at all on my ledger, I am trying to check my previous used address's using the goochain.net/ledger but it is showing empty wallet despite having btc in it
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:47:03
ye that must be what it was.
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:40:42
If I paste the Trans ID can any body have a look to see what's happened or explain it to me?
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:05:38

Fucking moon talk... when it could reach the sun...

Pff, I think you have done very very very well to only lose .1 of a bitcoin, trading, fomoing, fuding has cost me at least 100,000 usd, I wish i'd learned my lesson earlier. My friend said buy bitcoin when it was circa $700, I was not convinced after losing 200 to the MT'GOX scandal. I  bought ether instead and made a killing, I have since sold eth and am mining what I can, instead I hold btc and some neo as I see neo potentially doing an eth short term which would be very nice. Hold what you have or diversify a little, but day trading is generally a mugs game.
