@_date: 2014-11-09 08:03:19
I agree with your intention but the difference in this case is that people will advertise Bitcoin because they feel they can make money on holding the coins alone. There wasn't an analogous factor in the growth of the Internet. You HAD to be a business to profit off the internet. You just need to hold to make money on Bitcoin. 
That being said, as outsiders, having Bitcoin offered to you as a platform, if only the protocol is explained, it seems pyramid-y because you can't see what the coins can do. Services like ChangeTip will spur adoption because using it does far more for new adopters than just downloading an unfamiliar "wallet" and holding your "coins" in it.

The point is to generate more than a bit of discussion if it's just a bunch of average joes buying in here. USA Today is currently writing articles about the Dogecoin NASCAR. I can pretty much guarantee you that wouldn't happen if we sponsored this surfer. When small-time investors like the majority of the people who view this subreddit are going to put cash down on an investment, they should be shooting for the highest bang for their buck. A surfer is not that.
Here's an image of the advertisements seen on a [pro surfer](
Here's an image of the [Dogecoin NASCAR](
We can agree to disagree here because I don't even think it's up for debate that sponsoring a surfer is far less productive than sponsoring a nationally televised athlete in one of the largest grossing sports in America behind the big 4. 
Sure, he might get some photos taken of him and generate some buzz, but certainly no more than a NASCAR racer. People have made more money off Bitcoin than Dogecoin so anything that we come up with should be far more significant than just riding the coattails of a tongue-in-cheek cryptocurrency.
I'd even prefer a monster truck to a surfer. It's about making the biggest fucking logo we can and sticking it on something that people will see.
This post sounds like charity to me (which is all well and good) and if this is a charity case, we should be upfront about it and not pretend like we are sponsoring this guy for the sake of promoting bitcoin. We would be sponsoring him because "he just bought a house a couple of years ago and very recently and and his girlfriend have just had a kid and I imagine he's feeling pretty uncertain about what the future holds for him at the moment."
E: Also, Billabong dropped this dude for a reason. If he was a profitable investment for them, they wouldn't have.

There's more than one way to skin a cat. If we want this functionality bad enough, I have no doubts we'll figure it out.
Would there be an option to set up some sort of magnet link which would provide wallet info, without actually holding any funds? The magnet link just wouldn't be provided for users who haven't submitted one to reddit. 
I'm not sure if that would keep them more safely within the law. It certainly wouldn't be as secure but it would probably afford similar functionality and be easier to implement over other sites. Having reddit code wallets into their platform would probably be more costly to implement than the return they'd make on raking user tips.

It will certainly hurt smaller bitcoin businesses but so would any entrance of major players to the bitcoin market. Larger adoption will follow due to this and that's a good thing. You can still do everything you were doing before but now larger companies have a rule-set in which allows them to work legally. Other countries will adopt similar policies, so don't be surprised if Germany's regulations are along these lines.

While not exactly like Koinify, there have been plenty of Bitcoin crowdfunders:
- BitcoinStarter
- Swarm.co
- Coinfunder
- BitFunder (closed)
- BitcoinChipIn
- Propster
I'm sure I could find more if I looked. Now I can't say how many of them have received VC, but the point being is that the standard Kickstarter crowd funding model exists because the world doesn't have Bitcoin. Meanwhile, all of these groups attempt to shoehorn a more capable Bitcoin into this (by comparison) antiquated model. 
Re-envisioning a crowdfunder using Bitcoin should strip down the process completely and exist more as a phone book of public addresses which are reinforced by verified tweets, blog posts, etc. from the donation recipients to secure donor trust. There is no reason for crowd funding solutions that use Bitcoin to be taking even 5-15% of campaign funds because they're not offering anything that warrants that sort of return. They're not a payment processor. They're just a platform, like reddit or Wikipedia, both of which would die if they began forcing a charge on users. It's just an unnecessary rake.
Tipping and global micro funding is bitcoins "killer" function and the more steps and cuts we put between p2p exchange, the more it just makes sense to keep using fiat instead. Without simplicity, Bitcoin is just economic/political protest and that's not enough for average user adoption.
What confuses me about Koinify, Swarm, Ethereum, CounterParty, etc. is who is actually donating this much money to these groups. The capital influx they garner is incredible in exchange for what they've given in return. OpenBazaar has demanded much smaller amounts and produced far more.

Apologies. Is there a link to the actual article he wrote somewhere? I did some googling but couldn't come up with anything.
I'm torn between the idea that he was premised to think of the world in 2098 and chose to view the internet akin to a fax machine in economic impact and I don't see why he made the choice to take artistic liberties with the concept. His defense that he also said "there are lines in there about St. Petersburg having more skyscrapers than New York" because his effort was supposed to be thought provoking seems to imply that it read almost as a journal entry or some crazy story. 
The confusion here (for me at least) stems from how casual the writing tone was. I think it would be relatively easy to discern his intention (lets say some weird stuff and tie it together in an interesting way versus i think the future looks like this) from actually reading the whole piece but I can't seem to find it. 


I guess what Im looking for is some confirmation of this. 


The vague reference doesn't seem to imply a sci-fi entertainment piece any more than a broad prediction about the future from the point of view of Time. I would assume Time's intention for Krugman writing the piece would be to get a view of the future from an economist's perspective, not to get a piece of thought-provoking science fiction out of him.
e: [Found it.](
e2: Ok after reading it, I still believe that his intention was to literally predict the future to the best of his abilities and he happened to be wrong in this manner. He makes salient points on a number of things. He makes references to things that happen in his time in order to justify the future happenings but he just misses the ball on the social impact of the internet, which turns out to be revolutionary (The part where he touches on celebrity culture, he misses the point that the Internet is how people become so passionate about their celebrities). 
I don't see this piece as a thought-provoking science fiction journey. I see it as a prediction that may not be completely off-base except for missing one significant piece. He might have set up some more or less unlikely predictions to spice things up (like his previously mentioned reference to St. Petersburg), but his goal was not to envision an unlikely future. The original quote doesn't appear in this article oddly enough so now I'm really confused.
e3: His actually quote comes from a completely different (totally not sci-fi) article he posted on [The Red Herring]( This was an actual prediction.

I'd like to think that when my generation reaches prominence that we will have the mental clarity to make these decisions when they conflict with "what's best for me" but I can't say for certain if this will be true.
For example, decreasing the drinking age to 18 as a young person sounds very rational for a short term gain. Yet increasing that drinking age back to 21 seems like a rational decision for the long term prosperity for themselves, their children, and the country.

Your post is actually a two part question.
Is it a good idea for bitcoin to sponsor things which will spread awareness of bitcoin? Absolutely.
Is it a good idea for bitcoin to sponsor your friend for benefit of bitcoin? Probably not.
The reason why Dogecoin sponsoring a NASCAR driver is a good idea is because a lot of people will see their ad space. VERY few people would see your surfer friend and even fewer will care or show interest in bitcoin because of the sponsorship.

That rationale could be used for any currency. When I buy Eur I am unable to spend them at places that accept USD. Why would I pay to buy Euros when only USD is accepted where I transact? Conversion isn't the crux of the issue. It's motivation to use the service. Like Hotmail motivated users to transmit emails, Bitcoin needs a service that motivates users to transmit funds. ChangeTip is one of those services but the amounts being thrown around aren't significant enough to warrant the process of accepting them to many people.

I don't think he should have his medallion revoked for this either (probably because I'm biased towards Bitcoin) but the issue here is more than just the swaps he's doing. The taxi commission exists in Manhattan to provide a uniform, safe experience for their passengers and it isn't the place for drivers to decide their own policies.

I can understand the taxi commission would prefer that another driver who will follow those rules should have the medallion instead. There are plenty waiting.

My issue with Swarm.co and most other bitcoin crowdfunders is that they make it so much more difficult to donate to their projects than is necessary. With bitcoin you can send money from a to b with just a wallet and a QR code and yet in order to give to projects like this I have to sign up, relinquish my personal information and commit to spam emails indefinitely just to give my money away.

Why is it passive aggression? Wikipedias job is not to support Bitcoin but to raise money to support their service. If they feel they get fewer total donations with a Bitcoin link on their donation page, it makes no sense to have the link there. Then by refusing to donate Bitcoin until they add the link, you're in effect reinforcing their belief that accepting Bitcoin like fiat is not worthwhile.
There's this assumption that donations are given in exchange for advertisement of the Bitcoin network, when you should be donating simply because you like Wikipedia and Bitcoin is the currency you use. Wikipedia doesn't owe Bitcoin any favors.

The website is  and basically anyone who's looking to raise funds can post their public address and a description of what they do and we'll aggregate the QR codes in a common place for visibility.

So you have a record of delinquency and other banks don't want to accept your money because you already owe money to other institutions.

Absolutely. We are at a $5-6 billion dollar market cap at the moment and Bitcoin has the potential to be far more valuable than this. For example, Western Union's market cap is $9.5 billion and that is only one of the services where Bitcoin is a capable competitor. As more investors come to understand the potential of Bitcoin, that market cap will increase, often violently, towards a more accurate valuation, which will in turn have an effect on the price.

Once you have your data, I'm equally curious to see how the community responds.

Talent and time to produce aren't exactly rarities. Go to Soundcloud. There are thousands of artists just giving away their time and talent. There are plenty of artists out there offering music for free so why should we assume that people are willing to pay this guy 25 cents in a currency they don't hold.
I tried to offer the guy an alternative to a 25 cent paywall in a currency that isn't held by the average person. This has nothing to do with Bitcoin and all to do with psychology. Nobody's going to go through all the steps to buy Bitcoin just to give this guy a quarter for his song and if they already hold Bitcoin they may tip him more than a quarter for his song.

It's simply a matter of convenience. Reddit (or youtube or any of the other places you can use changetip) is a content aggregator and change tip allows you to reward content immediately with a monetary incentive. The issue with using bitcoin directly is a matter of visibility and a lack of convenience by comparison to changetip. 
Finding out if your content creator of choice accepts bitcoin and where to send coins if they do is more difficult by comparison than typing a line of text that's picked up by change tip and automatically handled by their servers.


I don't think so. For a lot of people, ease of use is worth the superfluous nature of the service.
@_date: 2014-11-19 10:01:11
Not at the moment. A few of us [started a database]( to facilitate anonymous crowdfunding to offer similar functionality without centralized wallets but there is still the issue with having to maintain a centralized database so people know who they can tip towards.
Additionally, Changetip offers a convenience aspect that has yet to be replicated in a decentralized way and it has something to do with sending funds to a party without an existing address. Basically someone has to hold those funds in the time between when the funds are sent and the recipient accepts them.

Price out the little guy as far as large-scale ownership, to clarify. A $10k bitcoin comes when velocity of bitcoin increases such that holding one warrants that pricetag. We're not getting to $10k with the purchases made on NewEgg. The utlity of Bitcoin grows with it's market cap and I wouldn't be surprised if the most prominent growth spawned from it being co-opted by larger financial industries (be it for remittences, escrow, bank-to-bank wires), maybe even before it reaches critical mass as a consumer tool.
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:00:31
You seem to think it's more likely that miners who have loads of coin and very high overhead to keep their rigs current would not want to give up their coins to a reliable buyer (or are somehow incapable of making an arrangement to do so) and then you go on to say that Visa could have bought them for nefarious purposes.

You're absolutely right. 
The purpose of a database like this would be targeted more towards charitable giving with any sort of compensation for the giving done on a completely voluntary basis by the receiving party. Kickstarter is a poor example of how this would operate aside from what donation pages could look like. Donation with direct expectation of return or receipt of goods/services is a flawed model and while it might feel counterintuitive, I feel like there could be a significant market for microtransaction altruism.

lol so you have no idea what you're talking about, you're just parroting what you saw on local news?


You reference the law twice. I'm asking if you have any idea what you're even talking about.


This has nothing to do with the regulations (the 'law' you mention) but instead incompetence of people acting outside of the regulations (which is why the courts ruled against the state). There isn't even mention of the boxes being paid in full in this newsclip so I'm not sure where you're getting that from either.


And then the court will rule against them and these people will receive judgement. Please don't change the conversation from "laws are bad" to "regulations are bad" to "government and banks are bad". Try to stay on topic.

And if they sell out to one social network, competing networks that ChangeTip operates on could very easily pull the plug on their accounts.

Bitcoin is novel enough with no further innovation that adoption will come with relative ease. Adoption in disruptive fields is driven by user experience and the innovation we sacrifice (only in America from small firms unable to innovate further to comply or circumvent) will be strongly overshadowed by the amount of adoption that will result from bringing Bitcoin services to major US financial players.

@_date: 2014-04-25 19:58:08
Agreed. While I'm a big supporter of the theory behind this and similar threads, nobody is actually using any of the schemas set up in these threads. If we wanted to give this the ole' college try, we'd have to sticky a thread where we develop the names and then enforce their use amongst ourselves, update FAQs, change wikipedia pages, contact wallet developers, etc. This would take a conscious effort to come together via compromise but people are too divided on how to break up the units, or what to call them, and we're just one piece of the bitcoin-related web so even if we could find a common ground, there's the rest of the network to disagree or ignore our position.
I don't personally see this happening any time soon. Some big name in the industry or in the financial world will end up doing this on their own, or in a very small group, and their names will be adopted. 
Things like this are where groupthink fails. We need one person to say "This is what everything is called." and then, more importantly, we need everyone else to say "Yeah that works."

Yeah the ignorance and paranoia is unbelievable. These protocols exist so the company holding your cash (or an employee of theirs, more likely) doesn't steal your funds when they see that they've been idle. I had a client once who completely forgot about an account with $200k in it. People misplace money constantly.
By placing it in the state database it allows you to find unclaimed funds without having to call every financial institution in the world to ask if they have any of your money. This is a good thing.

There's certainly this weird effect that happens because Bitcoin is money and not just another gadget or tech advancement. The typical paranoia of technological advancement is multiplied by the fact that cash is involved. Want to give each student a $100 Trezor with no money on it? No problem. Want to give each student a $100 credit towards Bitcoin? What kind of scam are you running?
That being said, we disagree again that this will ruin Bitcoin. It will be soon forgotten by most parties involved and Bitcoin will be ruined or not based on much larger happenings. This is just another facepalm moment for Bitcoin. We'll get over it when the next PayPal/GoogleWallet/Chinaban/Russiaban comes along to shake the tree.

You couldn't be more wrong.
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:24:43
Idk who down voted you so quickly. Your question is perfectly reasonable.


Bitcoin's market cap is far too small (&lt;$5 billion, compared to say Western union at $8.4 bil) at this point in time. I chose WU as a comparison because that is one of the features bitcoin offers but nowhere near the potential of what Bitcoins place could be. Bitcoin having a relatively small global market penetration in a large number of industries, or a large market penetration in even just a few key industries would take the value of a coin much much higher. I and others believe that the pure convenience of moving any sum of money with such ease will lead to a network effect where anyone dealing with fiat currency is also dealing with cryptocurrency because of the decided advantages they offer. 


Markets don't work like this. We can't simply say 300 is a fair price and the market should be reasonable and value it at or around 300. You can't stop speculation. There are people who think Bitcoin will be worth $10,000 a coin (and higher) and there are people who think Bitcoin is going to fail catastrophically and the market in effect finds a balance between these parties and everyone in between and that's where you get your market price. When things happen that change the fundamentals or even the perception of the fundamentals, there are violent swings as the market tries to find a more accurate equilibrium between all the forces at play. The fact that liquidity on most markets is shallow only exacerbates this. This is why bitcoin spikes and dumps the way it does and I can't see any reason to believe that this process will just stop, especially not at the current valuation.


What do you mean lack of development skills? The only thing that 'to da moon' thinking (I used the term in my OP because its in the title) is really doing is annoying people. Bitcoin won't be made or broken based on something so trivial.

He kind of blurred the line a bit more than you sell it. He's about equally as well known as a self-destructive drug user as he is a writer, thanks to things like the movie in your OP.
Instead I posit that we are not trying to shake the "drug user" stigma attached to BTC but instead choosing to judge people and things as the sum of their efforts versus minimizing their contributions down to divisive bullshit. Satoshi could be a heroin addict and I couldn't care less.

Change the protocol or let the miners do as they please and deal with them when they mis-step. Waiting for a tweet from the canary in the cave is not a sustainable system. You can't give people the freedom to do something and then get angry or surprised when they do it.

But a hypothetical moratorium for 5 years is regulation.

Bitcoin can be co-opted or controlled as much as the Internet has been co-opted and controlled. It's just technology and governments are still governments. 
People act like they're going to throw in the towel and just let bitcoin run wild when there's still a post everyday about trying to save net neutrality and stop throttling.
Downloading pirated movies and music are illegal in most jurisdictions and yet it stops nobody. Similarly, bitcoins fringe will have no problem doing everything they want to do with the currency while the experience for the average joe becomes dumbed down and restrictive but still far more convenient than fiat currencies.
@_date: 2014-10-22 09:48:44
You certainly seem more educated on the topic so tell me if I'm misunderstanding you, but I think we would avoid this because "Bitcoins" and "bits" are two similar but distinctly different terms. In addition to this, there hasn't been any accepted nomenclature attached to 100 satoshis. So "a Bitcoin" remains at its current denomination and a bit is just a piece of a Bitcoin. An "old Bitcoin" and a "new Bitcoin" won't be referenced because there is no change in its value. One Bitcoin = 1 million bits now and forever.
I do think in the court of public opinion, this is certainly left open for spin but I wonder if this issue would still take place if we were to switch to any other naming structure. The headline of "Bitcoin announces massive stock split" may be unavoidable and it's probably just a small bump in the road.

Man your attitude sucks and doesn't at all promote good conversation. Nobody's saying artists are starving to death and they need Bitcoin to save them.    
Spotify is one of the major streaming services right now and $13,000 is a pittance in return. If Avicii is making $13k, what are smaller artists making? Next to nothing. Certainly there are other streaming services and certainly Avicii is doing ok but the point is funding artists directly can benefit both the listeners and the artist by cutting out unnecessary expenses between the two.

I can't refute a claim that can't be verified. I don't know why people would be robbed of valuable posessions and just ignore it, but I guess there are special cases (numbered in the hundreds or thousands). 
The court system acts as a check and balance here and those who were wronged will receive justice. Going through the courts is obviously not the way this should be handled, but (to bring us back to point) this is why the regulations exist.
You've still yet to provide proof for your claim that paid boxes were broken into, and you've confirmed that to be your belief twice in this thread so I'd like to get some more info on that. I don't live in California so this may be true but I can't find any info to back up your position.

But he's defending his brick and mortar business, which in this scenario would then be competing with a Bitcoin-capable ATM. Do I send my bitcoin to (country) via Western Union, paying relatively astronomical fees and having to rely on a local WU provider and their operating hours or do I just send it to the person directly and then they walk to a Bitcoin-capable ATM and just withdraw the funds? 
The fact that he seems to think the interviewer misunderstands what Bitcoin is when comparing it to WU leads me to believe he is ignorant himself. He says Bitcoin must be regulated and then they will transfer it but he doesn't mention that by the time Bitcoin is regulated enough for Western Union's liking, there is zero incentive to use his service for any currency, let alone Bitcoin. The meat of his business can be replaced with an app and a corresponding ATM network and he either doesn't know it yet or thinks that the best plan of attack is to confuse people on what Bitcoin can do while emphasizing the flaws he thinks Bitcoin has, e.g. "trust".

For those looking to hold funds for clients.
Individual users and merchants just accepting coin via bitpay et al aren't limited at all and can continue to conduct business as normal.
Not sure how this will bring bitcoin "completely underground" though. We're a) kind of underground to begin with and b) opening up exposure to larger firms who deal with tighter regs. It'll fuck small businesses for sure, but in the same way that Dell etc. accepting bitcoin will kill smaller bitcoin sites aggregating locations where people can buy products with bitcoin. Not surprising nor omenous. Just maturity.

How do the regulations increase the probability that adopters will be arrested and imprisoned? Ecuador, sure, but the US by way of NYDFS, I don't see the connection.

Ok right but what is the law? You cited a law that applies for safety deposit boxes (and other things) and I wanted to see what law you were telling everyone about.
E: Found it for you.


box has been opened pursuant to this article, the bank may mail a
notice to the person in whose name such box stood on its records,
stating that unless the amounts due to the bank for rental, for the
cost of mailing and publishing notice of sale, and for its charges
for opening the box and for custody of its contents, and any other
proper charges, giving the total amount thereof, are paid, the bank
will offer for sale the contents thereof at a time and place named in
such notice, which time shall be at least 30 days after the mailing
thereof. If the amounts specified in such notice are not paid before
the time of sale designated therein, the bank may sell all or any
portion of the contents of such box, other than contents of the
character described in Section 1668 and other than bonds and other
securities which at the time of sale are listed on an established
stock exchange in the United States, at public sale at the time and
place given in such notice. Notice of the time and place of sale
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
county in which the sale is to be held once at least five days before
the date of sale, or if no such newspaper is published in the county
such notice shall be posted in three public places in the county at
least five days before the date of sale. Such notice need describe
the property only in general terms and as the unclaimed contents of a
safe-deposit box. Such sale may be postponed from time to time by
public pronouncement at the time and place of sale.
Ok so the law is that if you don't pay your safe deposit box for 6 months, the bank has to contact you at the address you provided and hold your shit for **two years**. Then after two years, six months and another 30 days for them to contact you once again and post an article in your local newspaper, they can auction off the old and worthless shit (like water bottles, old dentures, candy, etc) you literally abandoned on their premesis. This isn't a racket. It's clearing out inventory for people who are actually going to pay for the space they use.
Now there's no mention I can find of boxes that are dormant, but still being actively paid. If they paid for their box continuously and their box was still broken into and auctioned off, this is a bank error and has nothing to do with the regulations, making your entire post moot.
Banks don't keep the money they mark as abandoned but instead send to the state (who continues to hold it for you) so I don't see how you could possibly consider "these laws" to be "revenue enhancements".
But hey 200 upvotes for rabble-rousing. What else should I have expected from a thread that asks Coinbase not to "donate" funds to the state. Nobody donates abandoned funds to the state. They're turned over, so your forgetful ass can claim them. 
Fuck Lawsky, right!?

You operated an account designated for individual personal finances for purposes of business transactions. Sole proprietorships are businesses and you can certainly open a business account as a sole proprietorship. I worked for banks for a decade and did this regularly. Does it seem stupid and unnecessary? Sure does. Are you in different fee brackets and account requirements? Almost definitely. But it's up to the banks to set their policies and it's up to the customers to be aware of what they've signed up for when opening an account.
What OP is talking about is [chexsystems]( which is completely different. It's a database of bank debts that is cross-referenced by major institutions to ensure that they don't take on accounts from individuals or businesses that have outstanding debts with other banks. OP owes money to one bank, so other banks tell him to fuck off until he takes care of his existing obligations. There's little incentive for them to take him on as a client if he's shown that he's been historically unable to maintain an account.

Once again, as per BorderPatrol, who is in support of Bitcoin, it exists as a counterpoint to the over optimistic perspective of and the general Bitcoin community at large. It may be used by some for the reasons you state but you talk like there's some sort of organize conspiracy of paid shills and I just haven't seen any evidence to back that up. For every person that could be easily labeled an anti-Bitcoin shill, there's a pro-Bitcoin user that's equally as riled up.

I'm not trying to fight with you man. Just trying to see where you're coming from. Apologies if you felt I was being intentionally fallacious. 


When you said this, I thought you were implying that no innovation will occur once the NY regs were passed.
I realize now that you were asking me to confirm that I said:


Which I did. And I do believe that. Remittence services aren't innovative. ETF's aren't innovative. Wallet services aren't innovative. We will increase our adoption with these services and innovation was not necessary. I disagree with you positing that innovation causes adoption. Utility causes adoption, if anything.
I just personally believe that when it comes to new formats, easy access lends more to adoption than innovation (because the platform itself is innovative enough) and in this case innovation is only being hampered to a small percent of the developing community.

I've seen this video several times before. I don't disagree with him, but I think he's in a position that not many other black people are in. He can say "Don't talk about my race because it's not important." but for most minorities, their race is *extremely* important and it has had significant effects on how they've been shaped as a human. I'd bet that this is the case for Freeman too but he'll push that aside to get a post-racial platform across.
When you're Morgan Freeman you can get away saying this but things like Black History Month existed because before the month of Black History, there were zero months of Black History. It was used as a tool to at least briefly take the spotlight off of domineering white euro-centric history that makes up the basis of education for many people. 
The issue we're discussing is quite broad and there are no definitive correct answers. Having a post-racial view on the world is a great perspective but it's foolish to ignore that not everyone is on the same post-racial page.

Why would he have to go all-in on Bitcoin to make the statement he thought the idea had potential use cases?
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:31:03


In the same way he would promote Bitcoin if he felt he could make millions off it. That has nothing to do with self preservation and all to do with him honestly not believing that Bitcoin is any sort of credible threat to his existing holdings. It's not like he's not in a position to help Bitcoin if he believed in the idea but he doesn't. To assume this is because of self preservation is ~~foolish~~ presumptuous when there are plenty of other reasons why he would be completely disinterested in Bitcoin.

I'll play devils advocate.
Significant financial backing. Think Ripple but by Bank of America, redeemable anywhere Visa is. And they give the coins some sort of interest rate, like small bonds. ApplePay accepts BoA coins. Less volatile and more convenient than Bitcoin!
While its not likely, I do think this community is more preoccupied with decentralization and privacy than the average person and if they move in like this, ignoring the principals and emphasizing the COOL factor, they could probably compete.
@_date: 2014-09-09 05:30:41
You're absolutely right. Bitcoin needs enticing and exclusive platforms for people to use it. People join Steam or buy Microsoft Points because the things they want can only be had by using these services. It's not enough to give people the option to use bitcoin. They have to want it.

I like the idea of promotion that doesn't seem evangelist. I don't think it's effective. I think it shouldn't ever be a hard sell. Just put the info out there and small percentage will latch on or be curious. Anything more than "Hey you could probably save some money on processing fees if you accepted bitcoin." seems preachy to me. 
I think the community could see much better ROI (if we consider pamphlets/educational tools or even just time expense) by just straight up networking within the community and group buying advertisements. The bitcoin community is small but zealous. We should pressure those in our community with platforms to come together on larger projects to get people asking how to accept bitcoin instead of begging them.
@_date: 2014-07-31 07:42:06
This is an excellent point. While it's good to get in front of problems, it makes sense to only hard fork when you absolutely must. Thereby, you can work on a number of issues that might come up during the evolution of Bitcoin with minimal disruption. If one feature is done, it's sidelined until a fork is absolutely required for another issue and then patched along with it, or implemented at the time that it becomes necessary.
Now I have no idea if this is actually how it works, but I feel like it would make the most sense.

Bitcoin is a currency whereas credit cards are a debt-based credit product. You start with an analogy which isn't accurate. Credit cards and bitcoins serve two different purposes. Any parallels you draw from this point forward are irrelevant. 
But still:
If I have your credit card, I have the ability to spend at only certain vendors (you have no billing address, cvv, PIN, corroborating ID) and only until Visa shuts down your account for suspicious activity and then refunds all of the purchases. You're mildly inconvenienced.
If I have your private key, I have your money. You're fucked. 
They're not even kinda the same thing but if you make them kinda the same thing, Bitcoin doesn't look as good as your intention is trying to make it. I'm a big fan of Bitcoin but this angle isn't a strong one. It just feels like propaganda.
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:20:41
I'm in full agreement that tipping and micropayments are an excellent way to spread Bitcoin awareness but I get the feeling that there's all this desire to tip and very little direction. 
The real power of Bitcoin and all of the tipping spirit that's out there is in concentrating all of these tiny efforts towards major projects that will then in turn advertise towards larger audiences. While it's great to send small amounts of money to a ton of different people, I feel like it would make more sense to choose a unified goal and have everyone give money towards that effort. The goal should be getting people to want Bitcoin for their work.
Is there anything out there that everyone (or at least a majority) could get behind?

Resiliency is a key part of any store of value. I agree and I don't stress this in the slightest because if Bitcoin fails due to NYDFS regulations, it never would have made it much further anyway. I feel the same way about 51% attacks. Bring them on. Let's see what happens. 
We get nowhere living in fear of what might kill Bitcoin. People will panic sell at times but we're better off doing that now than when the market cap is significantly higher. The more shit we find out at this point in it's lifecycle, the more resilient it will be in the future.

People en masse didn't buy computers for email but when the convenience was there for them, they used it because it was superior to existing solutions. Bitcoin needs a Hotmail, or more accurately a reason to use a Hotmail-style service. If nobody is sending me emails it's probably just easier to use the post office.

I don't think he draws his parallels between Bitcoin and Beanie Babies well enough. More of the article is spent reminiscing on past bubbles than outlaying his case for Bitcoin. Nobody's arguing that the run-up to $1200 was a bubble but he seems to infer that bubble means it's bound to fail, which isn't historically accurate for most things that bubble. Bubbles are simply the result of over-zealous growth that then just as quickly returns back to the trend line, not a marked sign of full collapse.

These rules look basically boilerplate for any financial services company in existence right now. It's hard to tell if your anger stems from ignorance of typical laws in this field or over-optimism for what you thought the NYDFS would do to cater to bitcoin. I've got several years of experience in financial services and I'm not shocked by a word of what was posted. To think this isn't good news is absurd. This opens up a lot of doors for Bitcoin with some very major players. Additionally, players that shun rules will continue to do so and these regulations will do very little to actually hamper them.

Agreed. In order to make massive changes to a major company, you typically need an internal desire for change, a financial incentive, a track record for innovation and the willingness to go down with the ship. When your company is making a profit, it's a gamble and most stockholders don't like to gamble on the future any more than necessary.
Then once they have enough historical support to warrant taking the leap, they're no longer the industry leader and it's much harder to pull business from established competitors than it is to acquire customers new to the industry.

It seems kind of absurd they're raising money for a Bitcoin commercial in USD on IndieGoGo and not via Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-20 23:26:25
While it's not speaking for the majority, those holding large sums of bitcoin from when the prices were much cheaper don't have nearly the same incentive to rebuy after spending. If I have 1000 BTC that I've held since $10, I'm not going to buy another one to replace my spent coin because it significantly raises my cost basis and doesn't offer me nearly the same hypothetical ROI.

@_date: 2014-11-12 00:32:32
I think you're absolutely right and people saying that "Bitcoin itself is the killer app" are missing your point. We're discussing what the killer or breakthrough implementation of Bitcoin is.
In order to determine what Bitcoin's "killer app" (if there even is one, and not just a number of very successful or helpful apps), we need to look at what Bitcoin can do that other currencies cannot. The app would have to be so good that people are willing to convert their existing funds to Bitcoin in order to use it. 
I don't personally think a standard tipping service is this. It's a step in the right direction, but it's not going to cause people who don't own bitcoin to buy bitcoin. Instead, I feel like funds just become trapped in the tipping economy and are rotated around from user to user with nobody cashing out for a purpose.
So if micropayments are part of the solution that Bitcoin provides, the other half then is harnessing the power of combined micropayment towards unified goals versus arbitrary and typically ineffective donations spread widely to people who don't want them or are ignorant of its value. We shouldn't' have to explain "This is bitcoin, here's 3 cents". The goal should be to have people ask "How was this funded with Bitcoin? I thought it was a scam."
Crowdfunding has become an increasingly popular platform and Bitcoin is ideal for it because the blockchain acts as the trusted third party that would typically be held by Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, etc. Tipping Tuesday is simply an indicator that people want to be able to spread small sums of bitcoin towards collective efforts to the enrich Bitcoin as a whole.
There are plenty of industries that operate on the model of the people at the top of industry hold the money, they decide what they like to invest towards and then they fund it, making their money back when they sell the product to the public. Instead, we should cut out the top layer, with individuals jointly financing projects which are then released into either the public domain or pay financing back to their original backers.

Long term, I think this is almost irrelevant, if not the stereotypical "good news!" because a private company is building out an infrastructure we can make use of down the road.
Short term, yeah I think we're going to get beat up price-wise when they make the announcement.
People will say "why do we need bitcoin now?", while almost unknowingly eliminating plastic from their wallets and then when it's all numbers on a screen, people should then realize their B&amp;M bank serves almost no purpose other than restriction. For individual consumers, bitcoin has a ways to go.
@_date: 2014-08-02 09:22:59
Yeah that's because the regs aren't official yet. Things will change when auditing eyes are looking. Changetip will run into the same issues that Reddit will with this service. Ironically, or maybe even appropriately, the companies trying to make money off Bitcoin will have the largest amount of work to stay legit. Services that are open and free (as in beer) will typically operate unencumbered. Bitcoin will live and die based on group-think and generosity. The point is to create things that give them nobody to attack or come after for taxes. Their rules are detours and not roadblocks.
Thanks for the tip though.

I don't see how I'm on the wrong side of history just because I expected these regs to looks as they do and am neither angered nor surprised. There are no special impossible conditions given. There's no handcuffing here. They're treating it as they treat everything else. Are they overreaching? Of course. This is America.
I've gone through this power struggle of government control and money transfers with online poker for years. I worked in finance for almost a decade. I do wish it was easier, but it isn't. The bureaucracy is just too large. Fear is still a commodity and these regulations could have been much worse. They read like boilerplate financial regs. The NYDFS (among others) don't realize the strength of bitcoin yet so they will try to control it as if it is something that can be controlled and in their efforts to control it, they'll dig their own graves. Fine by me. 
I hope you find what you need in Europe and you don't leave too much behind here.
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:43:14
Irony indeed. I don't think that's a unifying cause regardless though. They should certainly accept Bitcoin but bureaucratic charitable organizations seem like the antithesis of something that would unify Bitcoins base. It's got to be something that directly benefits Bitcoin users as a whole so it can almost be viewed as an investment.

I think the recent jump, if it could be attributed to any one thing (which it certainly can't), it has more to do with 20x futures leveraging on OKCoin. If I've got enough coins that I can manipulate the market in one direction or another, it makes sense to open up a 20x contract in one direction and then force the market to move in the direction I want. OkCoin has led the rallies recently and this current trend started on the same day they announced the 20x futures.

Maybe I didn't make my point clear. If we're saying that discussing how Bitcoin would offer an alternative, I'm hard pressed to think of a piece of "general financial discussion" wouldn't be relevant to Bitcoin. The intention of the rule is to keep this board specifically focused around developments in the Bitcoin space and to avoid circle jerking on how Bitcoin fixes everything.
I agree that there are certainly discussions about existing financial events in relation to Bitcoin which can spur some interesting discussion, but most of the threads are not that. They're just places to post "and Bitcoin users not affected!".
In all of the examples you provide, the same discussion is brought up each time these topics arise. For example, if a country has an issue with mass inflation/deflation, we will have the same discussion when any other country has massive inflation/deflation. This is repeated ad nauseum for all of these topics. The intention of the rule is to avoid this issue and the mods are powerless to do anything about it because the second they enforce the rule, they're Hitler of Bitcoin.

It looks like there are a few different messages they send out, depending on whether the receiving Twitter handle has an existing wallet with them or not. It's not exactly what you're looking for though, I don't think. You could probably just go back to when you're showing the rush start on Reddit and collect data from that point forward however. It also depends on how your data turns out for what you find on reddit. If there's nothing valuable there, it's probably not worth searching Twitter and if there is some valuable data on Reddit, I would assume it all-but-confirms similar actions on YouTube and Twitter.

Your Wal-Mart example is so irrelevant to this regulation that I can't take you seriously. I can't draw one parallel between this news and that.
And adoption of services won't at all be hampered in New York as these regulations effect businesses and not users. People are still able to join whatever bitcoin entity they want, but now entitys that couldn't safely implement bitcoin into their business have a guide as to what will be required from them. 
Startups may not choose New York to base their businesses, but there was never an incentive to choose New York in the first place so I don't see that having any major effect one way or the other. All this does is open up Bitcoin to big banks and financial services, which is a major positive if the goal is to increase bitcoin's market share.
If the goal is to create an anarcho-capitalist dream market, there's still plenty of space for that to exist for now but bitcoins utility is far more valuable than that and it won't be relegated to niche users, nor should it be.

Can't argue with this.
My concern with the infighting is the lack of quality discourse, or at least the signal-to-noise ratio of the discussion. Disagreements are bound to happen but the vitriol makes intelligent discussion harder for everyone. The only way to increase that quality on an open forum would be to increase moderation which, along the lines of what you mentioned, is at odds with that organization. This is a consistent theme revolving around Bitcoin in-fighting.
It's these two arguing factions of over-organization and appeal to open-ness. We want to be free to have everyone have the ability to do everything but not everyone can do everything and some people are certainly doing more than others. While Bitcoin gives us the ability to create a financial wild west for the internet, I don't think at least some level of organization (and thus over-organization/bureaucracy) is avoidable, if only because we're dealing with a legacy system that is ancient by comparison and where bureaucracy is par for the course.

There is no official anything in a decentralized protocol.
@_date: 2014-10-13 07:11:00
I always felt that it was that trust itself was being decentralized versus being enabled.
As far as accounting is concerned, we distribute the trust of keeping an accurate logbook across the network versus having it held by a centralized party.
As far as 51% issues go, I do think we'll begin to trust a majority party at some point in the future but I don't think it's in the best interest of that party to attempt an attack nor do I fear the damage that an attack would actually have on the network.
The concept itself may not blow your mind, but it seems far superior to legacy systems by most angles.


Money has always about amounts being moved from one party to another. Bitcoin stripped this process to its core while also making it's discovery available to anyone who can access an internet portal. In doing this, it has also cheapened the power of many legacy organizations that have been skimming funds as a business model since the dawn of currency.

Nobody who falls under the regulations had a choice on whether or not they can "accept" the reg proposal and as I've said in several other threads, the limitations that this will have on the success of the burgeoning technology are minimal and will quickly be remedied by monied interests regardless.
You can't praise something as an open protocol and then be surprised when people you don't like start using it. How people expect Bitcoin to topple the financial industry without first being co-opted by it is what baffles me. Average people have to be comfortable with bitcoin before it takes over.

I think a lot of them (myself included) are working on projects but quiet to leak details. I still think we're deeply entrenched in the innovators/early adopters stage, which is positive in that there's a certain uptick in development of the ecosystem, but we're still quite a ways away from seeing what this software can do. 
I'm one of few around here that is looking forward to regulation because I believe people willing to throw money around in this industry don't want to gamble on a government hang up. I'm afraid I couldn't give you a reasonable figure of of how many developers there are but I see your point as far as maybe expecting there to be more going on aside from chatter.


I think it's upsetting that people act the way they do but I can understand their passion. The roots of this platform are around disruptive use of tech and general anti-establishment behavior so I can't say I'm surprised. I doubt however that any journalists actually care about the opinions of the readers.


No arguments here. I subscribed to hoping to find a more in-depth crowd but that sub just doesn't have much user engagement. markets was a nice sub for a while but it's become more like recently. I think the mods could clean this place up but back to my last point, the average belief here is that hands-off is the optimal way.
4. [Verbal abuse of core development team members]( over rumours/news, complaints of any development with a different brand (Ethereum, Counterparty, Reddit currency, Overstock etc); hero-worshipping figureheads (Andreas) and [making scapegoats of developers]( of all types when BTC price dips
Well this sort of stuff is just rude most of the time. I think a lot of it is typical trolling but it's sad to see people dedicate their lives to this only to get shit on when they misstep. That being said, nobody's perfect or immune to criticism. Any internet driven movement should expect to be trolled at any angle possible.

I wish we were more pragmatic about it than this. I'm not a buttcoiner and I think tipping is a very positive movement but I don't think that's any reason to ignore the possibility of tipping being used as extremely inexpensive viral marketing. It seems like we have a new changetip thread posted every day and there are certainly a number of new users that seem to be only tipping and religiously at that. While it's quieted down quite a bit, there were a few days where the saturation of tip-related content seemed unbelievable. 
If changetip was taking actions to be deceptive in creating organic demand for their product, it wouldn't speak poorly of bitcoin or tipping but of changetip directly and I'm sure many Bitcoiners and Redditors both would like to know. I really like changetip and the service they offer but there is something strange about the tipping boom and their immediate increase in presence on this subreddit as of recently. That's not to say that all of these things are connected, but the discussion has merit.

I just don't think this solves a problem enough people have. If people are making the argument that Changetip can only survive by selling the information of others, then this service has basically no way of profiting. The demand just doesn't necessitate a product like this as of right now. I could see Changetip adding something similar as a feature, but as a standalone it just doesn't seem worth it for someone to build and maintain.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:53:41
And the way he's phrased it, any future change in price is just "closer to the real value" as if Bitcoin (or anything for that matter) has a set in stone value.
Markets dictate "real" price. The "real" price was $1000 when the markets said so and the "real" price is $200 now that the markets say that. If the markets tomorrow decide the price of a Bitcoin is $1 million, that's the "real" price too. It's really amazing how many people think they're smarter than the market.
Id love OP to write a book on the real value of one Bitcoin so he could educate us idiot masses.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:48:12
His whole point is that they'd sell now because before it wasn't such a significant part of their wealth. Now it is and the fear of not retiring, lack of financial security or no longer being rich is actually coming into play. 
Holding now should be much harder than it was during the last bubbles simply because there is more (fiat) to lose. People that have been holding forever had their faith tested for $10 and $100 and $1000 now. It doesn't get easier to hold when you are making choices which will vastly dictate your financial future versus just losing some pocket change or hobby money.
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:29:01

False premise. Coinbase is not "trying to be a blockchain detective to everyones personal finance" but is simply monitoring your accounts like a fiat institution would (and will continue to, if/as they enter the Bitcoin space). This transparency is supposed to be a feature of Bitcoin. Why now are we supposed to fear it? Instead just avoid the services that don't offer a fair value proposition to you. For some, the convenience that Coinbase offers will outweigh the concerns you have.
If the motive of the thread was actually "it is up to us to not use Coinbase" as in, it is our option not to use Coinbase, your second sentence would be on point and the whole thread wouldn't even need to be posted. We all know we're free to use or not use Coinbase. You mean what you quoted as "It is our obligation as Bitcoin users to not use Coinbase", hence my reply.

The cost difference in doing this prior to $250 up until now is negligible though, no? The waves you speak of seem to have happened very abruptly and with no new products or services being announced. It could absolutely be added use and adoption, but I don't see why it's more or less likely that it's spam. Without solid evidence in one direction or another, I'm not going to champion the increase as a positive for Bitcoin because it doesn't seem like spam transactions would be difficult or expensive to setup at this time. 
E: This comes off as defensive of my case and I apologize as I don't mean to say it's certainly not adoption but just that the evidence we have could go either way. I hope that clears things up. I'd love for it to be adoption but I just don't see the evidence for that.

@_date: 2015-01-25 07:56:12
I may be wrong but I believe the Winklevii own 1% of all bitcoins, which works out to about 130000 coins, which has a market value of about 33 million. I'd imagine the large majority of these coins belong to the ETF and not the twins personally, but even if we consider them 100% owners of all of those coins, that puts the value of their stake in Bitcoin at 1% of Zuckerberg's net worth. 
So this prediction would require a single coin to be worth $250,000 for the combined net value of the twins' holdings to be worth what Zuckerberg is, or a coin value of $500000 for each twin to be worth individually equal to Zuckerberg.
In the near future, as prefaced in the title, this won't happen. There's no mention of Facebooks market cap in the OP.

The answer to this is always the blockchain.
What are Bitcoins backed by? Whats all that computer work going towards? What does bitcoin offer that the legacy systems don't? Whats the value of Bitcoin? 
The blockchain. A decentralized public ledger being used regularly that has records from day one is what backs Bitcoin. Every action that takes place there is accounted for and open to anyone who cares to look. The reason why cryptocurrencies are better than fiat is mathematical accountability and the reason why Bitcoin is better than other cryptocurrencies is because it is the one being tested the most.

I'm honestly not sure what a good comparison would be. I can't think of many things similar enough to Bitcoin to draw salient analogy as far as growth expectation.

As a tax-filing 501(c)3s that almost certainly have expensive accountants, it would certainly be ignoring it *if* that's how the law works. I'm only assuming the law works like that because bettercoin implied that it was. Sean's Outpost, BitGive, and The Bitcoin Foundation all raise money this way and I would imagine they'd be aware that it was illegal if that was the case. Hell, Ross Ulbrict's legal defense fee was set up this way by his attorneys.
If that's the case though, it does seem pretty irresponsible that they would brazenly raise funds in this fashion if the law requires this documentation, which is why I assume there may be some loophole or gap in the laws that cover donations of this kind. Nothing screams audit like a Bitcoin company that runs based on Bitcoin donations that they can't document them fully. There has to be some reason why they can do this, you would think... right?

Let me preface this by saying I hope you're right.
The flawed logic you mention in your post is still the belief of many Bitcoin holders and in the event of a severe market crash, people will likely act irrationally and move their funds as this is a very risky asset class. That could absolutely start a panic as times would be tight and people would be looking to secure gains and avoid losses. Even long term holders will look to liquidate some of their holdings when faced with diving retirement account balances.
In order to increase in price, the demand for Bitcoin would need to increase significantly or the supply would have to dry up. If you believe either of these things will happen when there is fear over far more established financial options, then you'll be fine. I can't say with any certainty that I believe this is the most likely outcome.
There are so many variables at hand that it's really hard to make a call one way or another. It's a black swan event. Who fuckin knows what people will do.

Dowinger Jones was perhaps the greatest investor of all time. Back in 1883, at 20, during the great porkbelly shortage, Dowinger went long on salt futures after stealing his family nest egg where he made his first million. By 1903 he'd cornered the steel market after his acquisition of the Brillo company some years prior. The depression did not bode well for Dowinger Jones and he ended up murdering his wife and his 11 children. The New York Stock Exchange honored the great work of Dowinger Jones by naming the DJIA after him.

Jesse Livermore, one of the most famous traders in history said famously, prices are never too high to start buying and never too low to start selling.
You're giving very cautious advice and that's great but this is just nonsense:


It's ex post facto reasoning, "buy low, sell high". That doesn't provide any actual insight. Buying bitcoin at $1000 was buying high and you're sitting on 200% gains because fundamentals lead price and not the inverse.


I'd love a source on this. There are plenty of traders that make a living on scalping ATH moves. Hoping that you're going to nail the exact turnaround moment on any investment is a fool's game. It's far easier to go with the trend.

What I gathered from the brief research I did on this is that it's parsing the info from the sites you visit and basically only serving up the content and not loading any sort of ads, which should in effect speed up load times. They're then serving their own ads within that content and paying users for viewing them, depositing them to your account with Bitcoin.
Now whether or not that works out to faster load times in practice I'm not sure but I'm probably going to download it just to see for a while. Honestly if they're paying out even the smallest amounts in bitcoin and the sites load in the equivalent time as Safari, I can't say I would have too many complaints.

Not sure who youre quoting here but I personally don't feel that is political because it's not hindering anyone from their use of their current fiat currency. It's simply an alternative option that manages to circumvent the need for government control. It's less "money *should* not be controlled by a central government" and more "money *doesn't have to be* controlled by a central government". The choice is still there for the individual to participate or not in the Bitcoin marketplace.
In the case of women and the pro-choice/pro-life movement, the legal right to get an abortion is what's at the center of the discussion. In a world where abortion is illegal, it is much harder to circumvent the law safely than it is to transfer Bitcoin in a world where the laws have deemed it illegal. It's not an apples to apples comparison and any parallels I attempt to draw between the two are too reductionist towards one side or the other.

The point being that "forcing them to make new accounts" is a matter of installing a browser extension. In exchange for that, we significantly increase the workload of moderators to have to screen account history for trolls versus just people that may be more critical of Bitcoin than others. 
As someone who doesn't pretend that this protocol and the prevailing discussions are always sunshine and rainbows, I personally appreciate I don't have to worry about being banned just because I disagree with the general sentiment. A user like nobodybelievesyou walks that line even more finely by generally being a well spoken typically bearish voice. As a thought exercise, do you also think we should also ban the blindly pro-Bitcoin trolls (what's the opposite of a troll?) like kiisfm? 
All of these unusual cases make the process of banning trolls significantly less effective than one might initially think. Add on top the concern that the community will rebel against what might seem like over-moderation and I think the situation is lose-lose. We have 150,000+ subscribers. This is what a general sub with those numbers looks like. If we had a more specific goal like moderation strategies would be completely different. 
I do envision a legitimate schism at some point towards another more heavily regulated btc sub if this protocol continued longevity but quite honestly there's not enough valuable discussion here to sustain two subs. Not yet. A change in mod style here could certainly bring that along quicker though.
If you're interested in philosophical waxing about Reddit, check out sometime. I don't think any of these issues are new or unique to this subreddit and often mod actions can have a more detrimental than positive effect on overall readability.

I tend to agree with jesset in the case of the convo you mentioned. Trolls will find workarounds to circumvent bans (it's not hard, after all) and its a ton of added work to for mods to have to review users comment history in order to determine if a ban is the proper action. I just think people don't realize how much the mods are doing and how much BS there is actually cycling through this subreddit, trolls or people pushing their Bitcoin services. BashCo has made several posts making note of his mod actions and it's just exhausting. Best of luck to you if you manage to get yourself some moderation ability like you mentioned but after spending several months observing the New page of this sub I think it's much harder than people know.

Then add on top that some members of this sub will look for any good reason to attack the mod team, I certainly wouldn't want the job.

Yes I've heard of bans. Let's try to keep condescension down to a minimum. It's Theymos' subreddit and as per reddit's policy, he can make decisions like that. Don't like it? Make your best effort to get one of the many other Bitcoin subreddits off the ground. If it was that big of a problem, people would migrate elsewhere (see vs. What you're doing is no different than people with zero commits demanding core devs be removed because they have too much power. Do something about it or live with what we have. With all of the alts and sockpuppets that exist here, I don't personally think banning will have much of an effect anyway.


This is wholly irrelevant. Buttcoin isn't inherently anti-Bitcoin in the same way that this subreddit isn't inherently pro-Bitcoin. Each respective sub happens to cultivate their memberships based on the collective interest of its userbase but there is no reason to think that someone who mods one subreddit couldn't also moderate the other. In fact, it would take far more restraint against bias than the average user of either subreddit has.
Buttcoin was made to be a counterbalance to like most circlejerk subreddits do around Reddit. People using it as a place to post tangentially related and blindly anti-Bitcoin sentiments are not at all different than people who use this subreddit to post tangentially related and  blindly pro-Bitcoin sentiment. They're two faces of the same coin to cut down on unnecessary flame wars.

I love this and am really excited for Chris and everyone behind ProTip but ChangeTip's big advantage is acting as an escrow service allowing people to receive Bitcoin even if they don't currently have a wallet. Replicating this in a decentralized manner is the big problem.
That being said, this is a step in the right direction and I'll definitely be donating some coin to ProTip.

Max is 32, which should be fine but isn't optimal because I think addresses could be generated up to 34 characters.
You should look into some sort of redirect like how a hotel forces you to agree to their ToS before connecting to their wifi. This would give you some ability to explain yourself and provide a hyperlink and a QR for people that are interested. I honestly don't think you'd see a ton of donations because BTC saturation isn't that significant at the moment but it couldn't hurt.

Yeah I've been slowly sifting through them with a few other people and adding the ones that are actually accepting Bitcoin [here]( There are a number of these who don't accept Bitcoin that he's chosen to keep on the list but it's a lot easier to search and donate with that directory I linked than this spreadsheet.

What I mean is, how will people know this homeless woman is getting the money, or even exists for that matter? Have you created any sort of communication tool so the people that support her can keep tabs on her? Like YouTube videos or a blog or a website or something? Not saying you're doing this but a gofundme with a picture of a homeless lady probably won't be enough to raise donations.
If you're doing updates via a website, put your Bitcoin address there or just post it to one of the gofundme updates. You can set up a wallet with whatever software makes you comfortable, whether it's on your home computer, a mobile app or one of the online wallets.

When supply decreases and demand stays the same, the net result should be positive because relative demand has increased. If increased demand follows due to exposure, that's just icing on the cake.

In doing some reading it seems to be a matter of there honestly not being enough volume to support multiple tip-bots. bitcointip closed as all users migrated to changetip and altcointip (which supported BTC also) shut down because their volume basically fell to zero. With the information circulating that a large portion of ChangeTip's activity is coming from a handful of users, it makes me wonder if there's honestly any demand for a tip service in the way people want to think there is. 
I haven't dismissed the idea completely but I'd probably need some assurance that there would be interest (or at least a bunch of free time) before I'd continue forward with it. Disappointing to say the least.

I don't disagree but it's a matter of intention (Do they mean for people to think they're working *with* these sites?) and unfortunately there's no way to know for certain if the goal is to mislead the reader or it's just over-enthusiasm surrounding a Bitcoin project (which isn't exactly a foreign concept on this sub). ChangeTip particularly plays with this sort of ambiguity quite often.

There aren't alternatives at all that recreate the same functionality. There are tools that allow *similar* tipping, but not anything that does what ChangeTip's core model is.

I watched a documentary about SecondLife featuring several people making money on that platform by creating in-game goods and services. Also the TF2 hat economy. Also Twitch streamers. I feel like you're being a little myopic about the possibility of gamers making money off their talents. It may not be a lucrative job for many but it could certainly be a small income for some.
The entire process of people making money in poker is wagering money on their skills against the skills of others. If you think that sort of desire to add more risk in exchange for more reward is limited to playing cards, we'll have to agree to disagree.

There are [plenty of groups]( accepting Bitcoin with no requirement to give info.  I find it interesting how some big projects feel comfortable not requiring personal info while other (sometimes much smaller) groups do not.
I don't think it's actually a requirement (think change buckets around Christmas) but some people prefer the security of BitPay/Coinbase over self-management with the added plus of farming the email addresses of their donors. You gotta figure if the jury is still out over BitLicense and etc, the same ambiguity has to still be available for crypto donations too.

Theres this site: [What Bitcoin Thinks](
This site pit a pro-life charity against a pro-choice charity, which conceptually is really interesting to me. It doesn't look like its being updated anymore and Id assume it's due to the problem of the site owner collecting the donations and then having to manually send them via Paypal. Having to trust the end user so much and then not even completing the transactions in Bitcoin is a poor representation of the platform.
If we could automate the process, it could be a really interesting angle on fundraising of any kind, allowing a group to get instant feedback specifically from their donors and not just the general public.

But what he's saying is supply and demand. There are more people looking to buy than to sell, and thus the cost per coin rises with the demand to purchase. The housing market works the same way. If there are more buyers looking for homes than sellers looking to sell their homes, house prices will go up. That doesn't mean that there isn't a seller and a buyer in each home transaction, but that the negotiation favors the seller because there are more buyers to negotiate with.
Of course there's two sides to every transaction, but the buyers are more motivated to bend on their bid than sellers are to bend on their asks. This is market fundamentals 101.

Absolutely. It also helps that this subreddit is not exactly impartial towards Bitcoin and thus another forum exists to cover the negativity that would obviously not be tolerated here. When a number of people feel that they are unable to openly criticize, mock or attack something they dislike, those people will congregate in a likeminded location. It doesn't necessarily make them correct, but people would be foolish to think that they will just choose to not voice their opinions.

You're putting too much emphasis on the privacy for this use case. Bitcoin allows money to go from A to B based on just providing the public address of the recipient. Any other information they ask for is unnecessary. People don't want to also relinquish their names, phone numbers, email addresses, etc. when they're already giving away their money. 
There are individuals who do this specifically for privacy concerns but most just don't want more spam email or junk mail asking for more donations or having to worry about their info being released in the event of a hack. The groups soliciting donations should be willing to just take the money without the additional info. 
Tl;dr: Beggars shouldn't be choosers.

That's not a bad idea. It's something I've been thinking about for a while but I haven't had any luck finding great solutions. Maybe if there were redirect escrow wallets with email addresses hardcoded to them, so once you send funds to the address the email attached receives a notice to verify the ownership of the email and where the coins should be redirected. This wouldn't be a very good solution for very small transactions though because fees are being paid to send to the redirect escrow and then again to the recipient and I'd imagine spam could be an issue too.
These are the discussions we should be having though. Taking stuff like this out with a bunch of people could lead to some really cool innovations.

Ehh, I think the nominal issue, while vague, isn't the major problem. A tip could be considered a nominal amount of money, especially considering most changetip transactions are for mere pennies.
IANAL but that part isn't nearly as bad as:


because I think that's where they don't have a strong argument. Changetip's sole purpose is as a financial tool. It's possible they consider the angle that they are not existing for financial purposes as they don't offer any fiat cash-out option but I don't know about that.

I don't think I agree with your "us vs. them" position but regardless, I'd argue your suggestion of refocusing the subreddit wouldn't be received well by the majority of the users here. 
As far as I've noticed, introducing heavier moderation to a subreddit that has been otherwise only lightly curated leads to a whole lot of drama with little noticeable change in the type of content that reaches the front page. Typically the result of this is a tangential subreddit like which may be better aligned to a single userbase but comes with a fraction of the traffic.

Maybe I'm missing your point but absolute stability in the Bitcoin economy (versus for example the USD) isn't something that anyone expects, no different than anyone would expect absolute stability in the euro versus the usd. 
I was of the belief that it's more a matter of low liquidity which causes the massive swings in Bitcoin that aren't seen in major traditional currencies. With more people buying and selling Bitcoin, stability will increase over time as a function of a more efficient market.

This is taking an odd angle on the argument here. Certainly Bitcoin itself has no public image because it's a series of 1's and 0's. The way I've seen it, the argument is that Bitcoin *has* a public image problem due to various facets of the community.
Bitcoin the protocol has no need to fight a public image campaign, but Bitcoin users could (and often do) make efforts to clean up their public image. That then improves the overall attitude of outsiders on Bitcoin, which could spur expedited user adoption, even if it has little effect overall on the eventual fate of Bitcoin the protocol.
Reducing the argument and then feeding up the easy counter position is bad journalism.

Theres so much drama surrounding Changetip and it's connection to this subreddit. Changetip solves a problem that on-chain solutions don't solve and that's "How do you send Bitcoin to someone who either has not set up a wallet or has not made their address publicly known?" This sort of functionality *is valuable* but may not be appropriate for every donation.
The whole on-chain or off-chain talk is a matter of preference unique to whoever is doing the tipping. Off-chain transactions sacrifice the trust element of the bitcoin network for ease of use and fee reduction. On-chain transactions sacrifice higher fees and transaction bloat for decentralization and transparency. Use what you want and what works best for you.
Is there any way to tell if the post was deleted by a mod or the poster itself? If it was deleted by the poster itself, this whole thread is stupid.

because it seemed to imply that this was a solution for those who wanted to see their tips go to worthy causes without accepting the ToS. The "thanks, but no thanks" crowd probably won't bother signing up to forward their pennies if it wasn't even worth their time to accept them to begin with.

@_date: 2015-02-12 20:33:17


Technically nothing, although they wouldn't do this because its horrible for business. The more likely scenario is that Youtube censors the tip platform entirely and adds their own (likely grounded in USD), which could then further censor who gets tips and who doesn't.


This depends on what your priorities are for a micropayment network. Bitcoin in itself is a decentralized micropayment network, so what features of bitcoin are you trying to work around? Do you want it to be a social platform? A content platform? A directory? Do you want to avoid fees? Do you want to keep transactions on the blockchain? Would you prefer a browser plugin?
Depending on your answer to those questions, there is probably a project heading in that direction. Let me know exactly what you're looking for and I can give you more info.

I feel like your title misrepresents your position. Price is important but it's not the most important thing. What matters most is network functionality. A payment network is useless if it doesn't work well and nobody accepts it. You suggest that vc and entrepreneurs should focus on products for the wealthy but those products will take off due to security and anonymity as much as they will because of (the possibility of) price increases.

This observation has probably been made since governments existed. If Bitcoin is as revolutionary as we all espouse it to be, we shouldn't expect governments to just hand over this power easily. As far as I see it, this is just another day in the bitcoinosphere. We tend to find ways around problems like this.
