Google "list of first world countries" close your eyes and randomly point somewhere on your screen.

Eli5 please?

that sounds crazy.. and yet.. somehow inspirational at the same time..
you have some good security measures in place it seems.. i will look into this trezor!

i am with 247Exchange now and did my first transfer,, no issues so far - are they good?
i saw kraken mentioned a few times but it seemed to have a very bad exchange rate?!

The stupidity in this threat is mindblowing. I dont want to scroll down further.

I tried but can not get past validation wit coinbade. I'm a resident of the EU, live and work in a EU country of which iam not a citizen - that's pretty normal nowadays.. For coinbase this is a mindfuck. I was in contact with their reps but they could not understand the difference between residency and citizenship,and I really tried. I just gave up wit them, too bad.

Same here I despise PayPal with all my heart. Nothing but problems.

Where is the foam?!

It seems price is being artificially stabilized somehow ..lately it seemed to jump up, then it fiddles away slowly until close to 3000Eur then gets pushed up again in one strong jump..

i have my coins stored on ledger. Should i transfer them back to an exchange and set stop loss before the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:38:36
on an exchange you can set stop loss that gets triggered automatically (if, lets say bitcoin loses certain amount of value).. when i have it on a wallet i have to manually action it which i can do.. but what if the price drops when i sleep.

nevermind, i answered my own question with some reflection.. are you a holder or a trader?! from the beginning i was in it for the long run, so i dont panic and will HODL. there will be dips and corrections, and i do know there is a bubble right now. but people behavior is unpredictable here, this is new technology, a new market, its whole new new territory.. anything can happen, but long term we are GOOD (i hope)
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:29:50
who knows.. maybe users will just sell their gold after the fork and change it back to bitcoin which would drive the price even higher... dip is fine, i can handle dips and dont play them, but what about a crash and no significant recovery over 2, 3 years... that would make me nervous

Or for people that use VPN..

Coinbase is impossible to work with, I gave up and am happy at bitstamp.
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:27:33
It is? Can you explain?
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:39:00
i didnt want to put my seed into the cloud.. even though its encrypted i feel i am increasing the risk somehow, but maybe worth a thought..
damn about keepass, i love it...hope they enhance it.
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:44:13
addendum: but yet again, if i have a trezor, i can always lose it.. if you keep it in your house, this can burn down, or someone can break in... with my solution even if i lose the USB i have a backup, and the USB alone is useless without my cloud access.....
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:51:06
any recommendations? is Trezor still most trusted here or did new players enter the market?
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:34:19
its a fair point, if the system is compromised my USB content will be compromised as soon as i plug it in.. having tails on USB to boot a fresh clean OS might add security here, but probably not failsafe..

Bitcoin has spoofing (as we are currently witnessing looking at today's development) so right now bitcoin is not a better alternative at this point..(I'm still in it for the long run don't get me wrong but right now worse manipulation can happen to btc due to its unregulated state)
