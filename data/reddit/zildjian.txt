I see it like this. PayPal is [a layer on top of] (repeat many times) cash. Bitcoin is more like the cash itself. Not exactly analogous, but you probably get my point. There *can* exist protection layers if you choose to use them (like BitPay), or you can choose to pay with "naked" bitcoin, much the same as you can pay with "naked" cash or you can have that Visa/PayPal/Whatever protection layer on top of it.

I'm a little confused, actually. [This page]( makes it seem like it's already on location.

Ah, you're right. I thought it was showing "College of Charleston TD Arena" and "Dig South Conference" as two separate items.

I'm in the process of trying to teach and convince my favorite local restaurant / coffee shop to accept bitcoin. They're already using square, which I feel is sort of a stepping stone. Any suggestions?  
  
Other than that, I recently bought an SSL certificate with bitcoin. It was a superb experience.

No problem! Also, is there perhaps a downvote bot running against this subreddit? I notice every top level comment over an hour old has at least one downvote.

Can you elaborate on that?

I'm very new to bitcoin - just bought my first little piece. Is this really as simple as it seems? Here, take 1 biscuit. @_date: 2014-07-16 18:10:10


How do I find your SC office?
