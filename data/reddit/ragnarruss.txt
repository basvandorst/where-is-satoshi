If I was this guy I would be $15k richer right now.

Nope. I'm $20k down BECAUSE I held and didnt want to be one of the "weak hands". I'm still holding now. Lost so much it's not even worth selling.

It should be spelt lose not loose

I doubt we'll see a return to ATH for 3 or 4 years minimum. There are loads of people like me who are still holding and will cash out as soon as we break even.
Sure, I'll carry on holding a few small bags if we ever see an ATH again but this bear has left a bad taste in my mouth.

Bitcoin dropped from $19k to under $4k in a year. What makes you think it isn't going to drop to under $1k over the next year?

Idiot ��

It has nothing to do with that. It's simply because many of us went all in last year and now have no more money left. Last year I lost over $20,000 of real money (not house money).
I would actually LOVE to buy more Bitcoin but I'm officially skint after being burned hard last year because I kept buying EVERY DIP!
Also, for what its worth, last year it was "OMG you bought at $19k but you wont buy at $12k... $8k... $6k" etc. Well I bought every dip and now I'm well and truly REKT ��

Should have just waited until it dropped under $1000 then you could have bought 3-4 times the amount.

Whilst that's obviously the case, people in crypto generally use the term "house money" to describe the scenario in which they've cashed out their initial investment and are now playing with pure profits.

One that doesnt lose 85% of it's value in a year. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:37:27
LMFAO Bitcoin's doing well aint it? Only 80% down
@_date: 2019-01-20 09:28:16
Loses 80% of it's value in a year

They *discovered* Bitcoin... and then all sold it when the market started dumping.
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:48:39
Awesome! Bitcoin is going to blow up now!
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:19:56
Bollocks. It was $4k for ages!
