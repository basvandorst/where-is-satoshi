What you are “supposed” to do and what you may be able to get away with are two different things. The IRS says you must report.

ANY profit no matter the amount or the time held MUST be reported

Not to be that guy, but. If Coinbase gets hacked and all BTC stolen, can’t one reasonably assume BTC crashes to near zero???

Didn’t he murder someone?

Kinda catch-22 going on here. Makes perfect sense to mine the asteroid...until the moment you do and prices collapse to near zero.  Space mining will never happen for economic gain.  Some rare metals and mineral may be mined, but that’s about it.  ��‍♂️

Don’t forget, if you sell now, you will generate a tax loss. Do you have other investments with big gains that you’ve wanted to sell? Maybe even your house.  BTC tax loss can be netted off against other investment gains. Even if you don’t use this year, you can carry forward into future years.  Bottom line, a “loss” does have some value, can be significant even, depending on your tax bracket.

Don't forget you will owe taxes on your profits. If you sell today, probably a few HUNDRED THOUSAND dollars. Please keep that in mind.
