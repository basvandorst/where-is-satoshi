think of it as a transfer into another savings account with better interest :-)

more bandwidth for the exchanges.. 
and as for online wallets - compulsory 2FA  and some military grade firewalls 
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:22:33
yeah its good to spread your eggs a little although litecoin does not have the development or spendability as bitcoin but as soon is it does id imagine prices will sit around 25% of bitcoin's value 
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:17:03
it needed to happen - its all part of the historic path to the top, just like Satoshi Nakamoto needed to be anonymous. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 04:47:20
or watch it wash away in the next hurricane :-) 
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:23:11
hope it goes down so i can buy more! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:19:46

@_date: 2013-04-04 00:05:11
not a drop an increase...

@_date: 2013-04-12 05:47:56
buy low sell high
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:49:27

Withdraw physical cash from bank (AUD)
Deposit into Spendbitcoins at local branch?
[inform spendbitcoins of your wallet address!!)
Wait for coins to appear in wallet.
ive never dealt with spendbitcoins but ive used bitinnovate a dozen times. never a problem with them, commission is high but so is the service, coins appear 15mins from bank deposit 
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:29:22
more btc for us :D
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:29:14
another downside of cashing out to FIAT
this is why you pay for goods with your BTC :-) will the IRS accept BTC CGT payment ? :-) 
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:10:06
thats 10 years down the track, at current exchange miners are getting enough.. Plus whilst the fees are this high it should be put towards further development.. otherwise BTC will die off and so will the miners, should be an option on the client to invest the fee to nominated development fund
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:23:15
lol take the coins to the grave then? 
coin production is set to end in 2140 .... 
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:59:30
nope still early days
get bitcoin while you can at any price. there not much floating around 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:01:30
the private keys would be offsite anyhow, they'd get no where 
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:20:29
end of the day supply is limited to 21mill (currently at 11mill) so it is inevitable that the price is rising not everyone can hold one BTC 
as soon as there is enough people participating - 50 million that's 0.22 BTC each. id imagine that 0.22BTC would be 3 months wages by then  
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:24:30
sure sure you will... :-) with interest ? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:21:08
you just found a market need my friend... now go out there an make it happen then get paid in BTC :-) 
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:16:33
im waiting to buy a house and car with 1.5 BTC 
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:19:10
i just see bitcoin wallet as another bank account with a pretty farkin good interest rate :-D.. 
just look it as a xfer of fiat from bank account to wallet account

@_date: 2013-04-09 04:39:00
if you buy bitcoin in the next 2 years you are an early adopter.
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:17:27
Sorry to hear, unfortunately this is type of thing is going to be a big problem for the mums and dads of bitcoin, there is no simple process of calling up the bank, verify a quick ID check and get your account unlocked/password reset.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:06:26
pay with with BTC :-)
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:13:39
