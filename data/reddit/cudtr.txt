i need a new site that not coin base i need one like circle and Bitpanda im in the us. that takes debit card and gives you a decent limit to start out with at least 200-300$ not 59$ and max at at least 3000$ like circle or more never asked once i hit that amount.

because i don't like to wait 3-5 business days on a bank account or longer. says 7 on my coin base account. i also don't like giving my ss card info out bad things have happened will never again. it bit me in the ass i pay money so im covered that was one of the sites i listed that asks for it to verify forgot. 
 a bank account killed me making money. i watched it go from 647$ and said i would buy and would had but couldn't because of circle or if it wasnt that low close to it money wise. but if circle was still here i could of gotten 647ish$ instantly to over 1200 and sold. i could of made double off one coin and more had 3k max. i want a site like circle if anyone knows of one please link me? already asked and got this reply. when it started to blast off i used my debit card max witch was 300$ that was nothing to what i would have made on circle. By that time i was pissed because i new when bitcoins went from 17-27$ and said to my self wow wish i  had the money. so i told alot of people that had stock in my family but no one listen or give me the respect that i could of made them so rich off those cheap coins and Multi times if they would had listened or gave me a loan.

   made alot of money on there this sucks knew  about the site when it was private and when it was open to the public. i remember them adding it to where you could turn your bitcoin into $ instantly no fee. only problem i had was adding new debit cards( i lose my wallet a lot) because my address had circle in its name not giving out my address lol. but i had to put it in there like cr not circle like i do with everything else before they would take it that was annoying and they didn't tell me that. i had to figure it out my self.  but only problem i had with them. there support was always nice to me. talked to them over 20 times because i keep running out of attempts to put a card on there. i will miss you/love you. you made me 700$ off 1.5 bitcoins ill love you for that forever and alot more and im not the smartest  guy when it comes to bitcoin because if i was i would of keep those because they where bought when they where at $179-200  cant remember was years ago. but saw it blasted up to 600 and saw it fall so fast i lost 100$ or more when i made the most i ever made 700. i couldn't sell my bitcoins back to my self fast enough it was falling so fast i lost at least $100 of made money. =(  and they would let you send bitcoins to your debit card you didn't have to have a bank account on there. i loved it, i remember they didn't have it to where you could turn bitcoins into currency before they would do it for you no fee. they where not slow 3-4 days like any other place. bought thousands dolor's worth of bitcoins from them. now im going to have to go to coinbase to buy small amounts to get to where i can buy 3000k worth or more idk there limits. its so depressing!!!!!!!!!!this year has been the wore year in my life and this adds to it  fml. I strongly believe bad things all happen at once because i died got brought back was in a hospital and not being let go for 13 days thought i was in a mental hospital but i wasn't even though they had me strapped down on the bed for days begging crying to let me go and to take them of me they said i was fighting them too much we cant. bs seizure make you do that kind of stuff especially your first one from a TBI. they  even started to threaten me ill put you in jail i said please this worse than jail.  i had a TBI Traumatic brain injury / first seizure ive ever had to long of a story and will bring back bad memories and a friend took much Xanax/buprenorphine witch is subutex says suicide but i know it was a accident because i know the real story his girl that he had a kid with she got mad and fuck her ex to get back at him because he had problem with drugs fuck her or he would be here. it wont stop and One of my good friends has cancer from dipping tobacco and hes fucking 21 to top it off my mom is dying stage 4 lung cancer only family i have left dad gone dont any uncles alive been to some many funerals it crazy i cant even tell you how many. im the last left alive in my blood side of my family we have a sad family my real mom who ive only seen pictures of ive never meet any of her family because she gave me up to my grandma when i fucking less than 1 years old so my grandma is my real mom and say's that in the will they got guardianship of me im sooo lucky =) i mean that. i could go on fuck 2016 and fml god i want shit to get better i wish i never saw this until i found out my self. was in a bad mood when i saw this fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck you circle for doing this i hope you fucking refer us and let them know how much we've spent cuz i hate having only 300$ to spend. fucking greedy people i fell like they probably got offered money to stop selling bitcoins from coinbase and the owner or who ever made that move. unless they where letting to many illegal traction go out and didn't want to get in trouble idk just a thought.  i very upset my night is fucked time to get fucked up only live once so they say. sorry about my rant.
