The work of "mining" coins is arbitrary. Yes, it is a clever scheme, setting a difficulty target and making everyone scramble to find the next coin, but the final result isn't exactly a commodity, it is more like goldfarming in World of Warcraft. A lot of the current success with being able to exchange real $ for bitcoin is that it is trendy, and because it is trendy there is demand in both directions, but that might not always be the case. This is unlike bread, a true commodity, because creating bread requires work and generates wealth, consuming bread consumes the wealth but does not reduce future demand, people will always want more bread.

Bitcoin, like $US, is artificially scarce. It is the difference that makes a difference, as they say. People are willing to accept it as a fiat currency only so long as the predominant market players are willing to accept the artificial controls that are in place. And yes, the same could be said about gold scarcity, the market players like to have certainty that no one is going to flood the market with a vast new gold supply. But the difference that makes a difference is that the physical scarcity of gold falls in a pretty narrow range, someone might increase the supply by 1% or 5% but a 50% increase or a 20,000% increase is highly improbable. With a fiat currency, this is not so certain. Governments aim for a small amount of inflation, but for a dishonest player there is nothing to prevent a 50% increase or a 20,000% increase in the supply. Bitcoin is constrained by X new coins every Y minutes, but that is simply by mutual convention, most people know that if someone were in control of 50% of the mining they could change that rule and flood the market, or strangle it.
So the exchange value of a currency, fiat or otherwise, is subject to the behavior, or misbehavior, of the market players. It is fortunate, then, that 99% of the time fiat currencies are just as stable as those based on gold or other real commodities. But governments collapse, and bills can be counterfeited, and no one will honor yesterday's exchange rate if there is 20,000% inflation, but you can always negotiate with gold (or watches, or sheepskins).

Sorry, but *you* can't simply declare this to be true. On the contrary, the market, in particular the exchange market, has declared that bitcoin is in fact worth so many $US per coin, and it is therefore a fiat currency.
Fungibility and liquidity are different matters.

The Marxist answer would be that it takes a certain amount of work to produce a nugget of gold, and work results in the creation of wealth. You can trade that wealth, or consume it, or put it in a box.
No such work is performed to produce a bitcoin. Rather, wealth is consumed as energy is converted into electricity to produce a string of numbers on a disc. The bitcoin is less useful than the gold, you can't even consume it, only trade it for other forms of wealth. And, obviously, the same applies for other fiat currencies; no wealth is created when the US Treasury prints new bills.
@_date: 2012-07-04 00:28:16
Gold is tangible and non-artificially scarce. It gets value directly from these qualities, there is no reason to "fiat" it into currency.
My original point (implied) was that for a fiat currency to be viable, it has to be declared a valid form of currency by some institution, *and* the market has to agree that it has value. I can declare my fingernail clippings to be a fiat currency, but the market isn't going to give a fuck.
And getting back to that special property of physical things like gold, say I have a nugget of gold worth $10, and a loaf of bread costs $1. Now say that $US undergoes 500% inflation. The nugget of gold is now worth $50, and a loaf of bread costs $5. Well how about that, in my contrived example I can still buy 10 loaves of bread with my nugget regardless of changes in the value of some fiat currency.
@_date: 2012-07-02 20:10:33
Gold and silver are physical objects. Currency that is backed by gold or silver can in fact be exchanged for the physical object, if the currency backer is actually motivated to maintain that value. $US became fiat when they decided it was not longer backed by gold, but allowed its value to move within the market.
But I guess you don't understand the distinction.

When you look closely, "law" is simply an institutional convention favored by governments. People are willing to accept fiat money backed by governments because they provide good near-term stability, I am willing to take someone's money today because I know I will be able to exchange it for something else tomorrow. As far a people are willing to accept Bitcoin in the same way, even though it has no intrinsic value (the "computational power" idea is meaningless), it behaves as a way to settle debts. That is the whole fucking reason why it was created.

But meanwhile, the gaming market has shifted towards casual games on smartphones with no power to spare (and you're certainly not going to download a complete block chain on you phone), plus it is meaningless to say they are going to "sell that spare computing time to the Bitcoin network", all returns on mining are proportional to total network hashing power, you are always competing for a fixed supply.

This strikes me as a rather silly arms race. The faster you can calculate hashes, the more likely you are to win the block race and get paid. Then the difficulty goes up, and those with faster hashrates win more blocks, until everyone switches to the faster hardware and the whole cycle repeats. Meanwhile a fantastic amount of entropy is generated as those CPUs consume watts. Short term gain, long term disaster.

Well according to the basic ideas of capitalism, the products of mining (gold, for example) have value because of the labor required to obtain it. All the trucks, buildings, factories, and regulatory agencies and the associated labor costs so much $ per ounce. Making something more efficient to produce has an effect on the value, and in the particular case of bitcoins there is a whole lot of deflationary pressure that is going to do some weird things down the road.

Well Wikipedia says: "Quantitative easing has been nicknamed 'printing money' by some members of the media, central bankers, and financial analysts. However, central banks state that the use of the newly created money is different in QE." So you can have your opinion on this, but that's just, like, your opinion, man. In my mind, "printing money" is a literal thing, the Fed creates new bills and hands them out. Of course keeping the interests rates "near 0" effectively does the same thing, but that is a *figurative* printing of money, not the actual printing.

State control of currency only goes as far as people are willing to use that currency. This is in part why currencies even work at all. A Big Institution says "This token is good for the exchange of a certain amount of goods," and that is convenient for most people. But if Big Institution were to say "You may not use any other form of exchange than tokens," then the system will eventually collapse. It hardly makes a difference if that Big Institution is a State, or if it is a collaborative network of node operators; currencies are built on trust and confidence, and rely on use, and institutions can only control one of those factors (trust).

Sorry, but wealth is the product of labor. If you squander your labor on fingerpainting that is your own problem, and certainly not all labor is productive, but in a world where you can literally go out and pick fruit off of a tree and sell the fruit it should be clear that it is the value of the labor to produce the product that generates wealth.

If you are an owner/manager and your company is growing faster than expected, you are unlikely to listen to your developers who say you need to slow down so they can create and debug a test version of your software, and that this will take two weeks/two months before some new features can be rolled out.

Are you so completely unaware of the history of agriculture in the 20th century? Yes, mechanization allows a worker to multiply his labor, which was met (after a slight delay) by a decline in value of the wealth produced, resulting in the consolidation of ever larger farms with fewer and fewer owners, the destruction of subsistence farming, and so on.
Or do you think the farmer really gets $2/lb for the apples he grows? No, he gets maybe 5 cents a pound, plus a fat government subsidy to keep his farm going. We now produce wealth through "value added" technology - food processing, branding, durability.

Interesting. The only reason people in the US might be aware of the term, which was not previously in common use, is the Federal Reserve has been going through a process they call Quantitative Easing, whereby they use reserve funds to buy US Treasury Bonds and keep bond rates slightly lower than the market wants.

Sounds like a pretty fatal weakness to me. At the very least, you could shut down anyone running a node that doesn't do some intelligent filtering of transactions.

Except the volume on mtgox is over a magnitude greater than on paypal. Once you try to increase volume on paypal that price will go down.

I think there will be technical issues long before it gets to the $1k mark. The number of transactions will increase by several orders of magnitude, but how fast with the network grow? Plus, at an exchange value of $1k, a .01 BTC transaction fee would be worth $10, and that is going to cause problems with small exchange amounts.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:43:52
I like what you say here. Plus I think the situation is exacerbated by how difficult it is for a new buyer to even get started in the market. If it takes you a week to get a trading account set up, then that is another week before that buyer can properly evaluate bitcoin worth. Also, the rate of new buyers joining the queue is increasing, and this feeds into the incorrect evaluation, the prolonged increase in demand overshadows the longer history.

There is an obvious problem here but I guess I have to spell it out for you guys: One of the contributing factors to the scarcity, and thus the value, of bitcoins is the number of hurdles it takes to trade in the market. At the same time it is in the interest of MtGox to maintain these barriers, because lowering them would both increase costs due to labor (which is not free) and lower the scarcity.
On the other hand, this is a clear business opportunity for someone to go up against MtGox. Of course that has been the case for over a year.

Where the lag is all depends on the application architecture.
On the customer facing side you have web servers. Customers can log in, can take care of their banking transfers, and can post a buy/sell market order (or a buy/sell limit order). This order doesn't get handled directly by the web server, it goes into an order queue.
The trading engine is (hopefully) another set of servers. The engine has a big list of all the buy and sell limit orders, hopefully ordered by price and priority. Since the engine has one primary job - matching buyers with sellers - it can be highly optimized for this task, with all the memory and CPU power it needs to run smoothly. If it is not optimized, there will be lag.
Now the engine grabs the order at the front of the queue and gives it the once over. If it is a market order, it finds the closest matching offer (bid or ask) and runs the transaction, moving virtual bits across accounts and putting everything into the database. If it is a limit order, it tries to match it with the current market; if there is no matching offer it gets added to the big list of trade orders. Now go back to the queue for another order.
The time it takes to look at an order, search a matching offer, perform the transaction and/or store the trade for later is the second potential source of lag. If it takes 1 second to process a transaction (which is horribly, horribly slow by modern standards) then you are going to limited to 3600 transactions an hour; more transactions means an increased lag.
A third source of lag is going to be the database/persistence architecture for processing bank transfers into accounts, and how that might interfere with the performance of the trade engine. If a bank transfer requires the database to block all other requests until an account it updated, then the trade engine will lag, and as blocking activities increase, again lag increases. There may also be automated processes that cause this kind of blocking every hour, or every five minutes, or every Wednesday. (When exchanges do not run 24/7 this stuff doesn't cause so much of a problem.)
A fourth source of lag is going to be the overall capacity and interdependence of all the servers. If a server is working to both deliver web pages and perform bank transfers and run the trading engine then a spike in any of these will impact all the others.
Anyway that is how I imagine the trades get lagged. I have no information about how mtgox is actually setup.

The low capacity of the market has an *artificial* effect on the scarcity of bitcoins.

A speculative bubble is a speculative bubble, regardless of the type of security. The price of bitcoin is way out of line with the historic value, because there is a very high amount of demand, and even with only basic high school economics you should know that high demand will cause the price to go up. What happens when demand returns to pre-Cyprus levels? What happens when mtgox finally streamlines the verification process and this steady influx of money slows to a trickle?

Actually I'm assuming that queue processing has to be one at a time, to preserve the first-in/first-out nature of the queue. Now if you can do this with a clever pipeline or multiplexing scheme that is all fine and good, but a queue is a queue. And these should be speedy transactions on internal systems.
And I disagree that this is a "multi-user" process. The trading engine is a specific component with a very narrow focus that requires no user intervention. Maybe you are thinking about taking orders from users, but as I said earlier that is isolated from the processing of the queue. The web server gets an order, does the footwork of checking for a valid user, checks their balance, puts the order in the queue, and returns something to the web client, and you have a cluster of web servers for this.

"Savings" usually implies you are getting some kind of return on the money, even if it is .1%. Hoarding is the same as putting it under a mattress.

All you libertarian nutjobs want to live in a world where everything is permitted and contracts are sacred objects, and then someone tries to enforce a contract that doesn't benefit you and your panties get twisted. This is the libertarian dream right here: endless, mindless litigation that will consume everyone who isn't a lawyer.

This wasn't some innocent "can you watch this stack of money for me?" arrangement. This was a "you offer a rate of return that find attractive, please put this money in my account" agreement. There is an expectation of some due diligence by the depositor. Not just an examination of the bank, but of the political situation under which it operates. I mean, who the fuck banks in Cyprus?

There is the not-controlled-by-the-state feature, but that kind of missed the mark for me. I'm not so worried about state control as I would be worried about state OR corporate OR covert control, since Warcraft gold would be just as good as any other currency if only it wasn't controlled by a company that can turn it off next week. Or rather, since you can't get away from centralized control (if you want real long term stability) you need some kind of non-centralized *counter*-control to keep things in check. For example, with state controlled currency people can simply *not use it* and the system doesn't work. With Bitcoin, someone (or group of someones) will eventually rise up as the *de facto* controller of the currency, and how will people react? I am afraid there will be a few schisms (already happening) and the market will collapse.
Perhaps something more like a short term cryptographic scrip would work better, in my opinion. Groups could issue scrip, new groups could issue other types of scrip, they could be exchanged, and they could be retired. Dishonest players could do limited damage. And maybe there will be less fucking speculation.

The biggest risk that will prevent Bitcoin from ever reaching a 1000x market cap is: fragmentation. Bitcoin orbits around the Satoshi blockchain, which benefits the founders and the earliest adopters (it is too late to become either of those). Alternative crtypo-currencies have already cropped up, and more are just around the corner. Once these new currencies start to compete with each other, the market will become noisy and confusing. And as the weaker crypo-currencies schemes implode, people will try to calm the panic by saying, "Oh that currency was flawed, but *this one* is perfectly safe."

In many ways yes, the dotcom bubble was a technical problem. Just not a technical problem with how trades were handled. With the dotcom crash, people who were on the verge of bringing even more money into the market looked at what was happening, decided that the stocks were dangerously overvalued because the technology just plain sucked, and ran in the other direction. As a currency, if the Bitcoin market can be paralyzed for nearly two days by a single dysfunctional exchange, then it is quite likely that the same thing will happen. If only you could buy something besides illegal drugs and consumer electronics, then Bitcoin would have a reason to exist.

Pure speculation here, but with real securities you have a number of brokerages that keep their own order books and can carry out trades either within their own book or with other brokerages who trade those particular securities. (With mtgox you have a whole exchange for just one security which is kind of unusual.)
So if I go to an exchange and place a market order for stock X, they check their order book for orders to sell stock X. If there is an order that will work, they fill the order internally. If not, or if they think there is a better deal to be had, they ask their partner exchanges if someone else has orders to sell stock X. If the deal looks good they can fill it that way. By keeping track of the external price published by other exchanges, the price won't be way out of line for internal orders.
Of course these real exchanges don't stay open 24/7, they have lots of downtime so they can rectify accounts and file paperwork and send glossy reports to their investors. In time I imagine mtgox and other bitcoin exchanges will go this route as well.
Anyway, you could run a bitcoin exchange in this fashion, with several virtualized brokers each keeping their own order books and tracking the open orders of all the partners, all in the same exchange. A client would then have to choose to place an order with a particular broker at the exchange. And there might be some variation between those brokers, with different fee structures, or different trading requirements. That is one way you could increase the throughput of trades while still dealing with first come, first served processing.

Getting approved by a bank for wire transfers and all that regulatory stuff would be outside the scope of any trading engine. But if there was an open source package that could bootstrap a company willing to handle the banking end then starting new exchange sites wouldn't be as difficult.

There goes liquidity.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:40:33
Explain again how limiting the liquidity of the market is stabilizing? The current level of demand is being throttled by the order queue issue. Demand would have spiked already if not for this issue, and the price would be more stable.

That is why I find this funny. It is the easy jump from "has not been hacked" to "cannot be hacked" to "will NEVER be hacked".
Meanwhile, I'd say about 20% of people involved in the actually trading of bitcoins have been scammed, lost wallets, or have been at risk of losing coins due to insecure infrastructure.

This is the point at which people go out on the street and try to barter Bitcoins for goods and services. "I don't have any cash, but I'll give you 1/4 bitcoin for a hamburger. Please?" As the supply dwindles, the actual value of the commodity/currency/bottle-cap gets tested.

Sadly this describes why the banking system is the way it is today. Banks haven't survived because they are full of talented and forward thinking people who want to provide a quality service. Rather, these banks are the ones that were best able to withstand assault and internal incompetency, but just barely. It is hardly grounds for loyalty.

Ah, you are a hero for the corner entrepreneur! And those big corporations are just pushing the little guy around with their fees.
But really, credit card fees are part of the cost of doing business, and even if you own a corner grocery store (whatever) you had better be able to make that calculation or you aren't going to survive.
I thought Bitcoin was the magic libertarian currency, and yet here I am defending the free market. This is what the market does, **and it will do the same thing with Bitcoin**. Why? Because even though the credit card companies don't control fiat currency, they can still get away with what they do because they provide a service that people want.

Aside from how I feel about the State and the freedom of cryptocurrency (which sounds pretty looney to me), I don't see Bitcoin as anything more than an interesting idea flawed by bad design. For it to succeed, it will have to implement the same kind of big bank tools and fee structures that everyone wants to escape from, and that will be that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:47:54
Is it really a sell-off / crash / whatever when very few people can actually see what is going on? More than half of what is going on right now is due to weak infrastructure, there just aren't enough resources in place to determine when a price change is due to public sentiment versus technical issues.
Most likely the price will return to a higher level, because that pent up demand is still there. But there will be a lot of butthurt folks who weren't paying attention to their open orders when the sun came up today.
