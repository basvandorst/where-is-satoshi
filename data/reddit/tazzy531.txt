Merchants that accept Bitcoin should be able to provide discounts of 3% or more. 
When they take credit card payment (card not present), it costs them a bit more than 3%. Accepting payments using bitcoin/coinbase is free and conversion to USD is only 1%.
In addition, due to the lack of chargebacks, the amount they need to allocate to fraud/chargebacks is lower.

They are in the payment processing business, not speculation. Because of that, they will always reduce their risk and exposure to exchange rate (they'd rather make a little consistently rather than take a big risk of losing a lot) 
So, they will not be holding onto much bitcoin. Everything that they hold will be hedged out.

Just curious, why do you want exposure to the volatility? If you are a regular merchant, you have liabilities in USD, why would you ever hold BTC? 
Coinbase and Bitpay allow you to eliminate that volatility risk.

Because it actually doesn't accomplish anything other than make people *feel* that they are moving the ball an inch further. It's as effective as one of those "click like If you want to end poverty" on Facebook.

We are arguing the same thing at this point. We agree that btc will have a major impact on commerce now and in the future. We also agree that stability will be better for btc. 
The only point I dispute is that bitpay masks the underlying currency from the merchant. At that point, one can make the same argument that one can purchase a Tesla using baseball cards by having the payment processor exchange the baseball card for usd, but that doesn't make baseball cards a useful commodity. 
The tipping point for btc is when a merchant wants to accept and hold btc because they can use it on the backend for their supplier. Until we get to that point, the utility of btc is just a carrier of value than actual value itself.

Sorry to come on r/bitcoins to say this, but IRS can put some dent in the viability of bitcoins. 
When the IRS requires you to provide a full accounting of your bitcoins to prove that there's no taxable income, that will make it less appealing.

That's the thought that I had. How would you peg it to multiple currencies? Different international markets grow and shrink at different rates; I can't imagine how you can peg btc to usd, jpy, eur at the same time. 
I'm sure some economist have thought through this and I'd be curious with their approach. (if you have any links to economic papers on this, I'd be interested). 
Edit: noticed that you included basket of currencies.. That may do it, but still difficult.

So, would you also say that all American businesses accept Japanese yen because someone from Japan uses their Mastercard to make a purchase?

It's basically the same as converting your bitcoin to cash and paying with that.

Euro and dollar are "stable" because they are the world's reserve currencies and you have people that have coarse control over it. 
In addition the size of the fx market is huge (5.3T / day) whereas the overall market cap of bitcoin is 9B with $79M transacted per day. 
One day, it will stabilize, but a lot has to happen before then.

The other function of the hashing us to confirm transactions. If I were to send you money and it takes months or years to confirm, this would not be a viable platform. 
As the other poster said, problem difficulty readjust regularly to maintain the 10 min target.

That's like saying that business owners are OK accepting Zimbabwean currency if there is a payment processor that is willing to convert it to USD. 
For wide adoption, you don't want people to transact out of the currency, you want people to use that currency. That's how you increase velocity and confidence in the system. The business owner should be able to take the btc that he receives and pay his supplier with btc. 
Don't get me wrong, btc is a revolutionary product. But don't get tunnel vision on this and not see its current faults. In a few years, all of this will stabilize, but it's just not there yet. 
Edit: 
Additional point.. If my business accepts Mastercard/Visa. One of my customers from Germany uses his Mastercard to pay and he pays his credit card bills in Euros, would it be accurate to claim that I accept Euros?

Biggest weakness in the technology is that you're dependent on exchanges to convert USD to bitcoin and vice versa. As demonstrated here, a regulator can shut those down pretty easily. 
While, yes, the protocol is sound and you can still buy btc without the exchanges, the increase friction may be just enough to cause it to be not as useful as it could be. 
The projected value of btc ($1k, $40k, etc) was that btc takes over commercial payments. 
Also, just remember, visa/Mastercard stand to lose a lot if btc ever gets traction. And they have large lobbying arms.

And I'm saying, without the Internet, bitcoin are useless. Bitcoin works on a public ledger. If you can't access the public ledger, No transactions can be performed. 
Even in your case of using a paper block chain, you can at most do a single transaction. You won't be able to do multiple transactions offline. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:18:02
Your first point is a negative from the perspective of wider adoption of bitcoin in commerce . 
Business owners, like OP, want a stable currency that they are willing to take on bitcoin exposure. Volatility in currency, whether btc, usd, or jpy, is not a good thing. 
Secondly, a currency that is rapidly increasing reduces the number of people that want to spend it. If you can get more goods for your btc tomorrow than you will today, you will more likely hold than sell. This lack of velocity in the currency decreases the value of it as a currency.

Read the article, that the exact opposite of the case in the article. 
The great thing about Bitpay is that the merchant isn't ever exposed to BTC. They charge USD and receive USD. Bitpay plays the role of the payment processor for the merchant in the same way that Mastercard does.

Are you willing to sell me your car for a paper block chain? If you're not willing to accept mine, others are not willing to accept yours. 
The key to bit coin is that it requires this cryptographic calculation to prevent double spending. Without this chain of trust, the value of bitcoin goes to zero. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:40:33
I'm not dismissing them. I totally agree they are a critical part in the BTC ecosystem and are key to wider adoption. 
It is a big advancement when merchants accept BitPay. The next major and critical advancement is merchants actually accepting BTC themselves.

Fine. How about your cellphone? Or a box of cereal? Or a bottled water? 
My point still stands that a bitcoin is unspendable without a transaction confirmation. 
If you want to try it, let's do this. You PayPal me $10 and I'll mail you my block chain transaction. When you receive it in the mail a couple of days later, you can enter the transaction. 
It's the same scenario.

I wasn't talking about purchasing power. I'm just talking about expected future value vs present value.

Agreed. The market will reach an equilibrium. 
My only point here was that an ever growing valuation is not healthy as the person that I responded to desired. 
This is a short term misalignment of valuation and once we reach stable state, a good currency should be one that neither increases nor decreases in value over time. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:17:41
You are totally correct. The volatility of bitcoin at the moment is not conducive for commerce, even with processors like bit pay. 
You would not be able to put signage up as to the price of a product in bitcoin because you as a business owner do not want that fx exposure. 
Over time though, as bitcoin gets wider distribution, the exchange rate will stabilize. Only when it stabilizes will it be useful in regular Commerce. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:26:12
That's my point. 
Merchants don't go around advertising that they accept Euros, JPY, pounds, renminbi, etc (as long as you use your credit card). 
Until the merchants want to receive btc and can pay their suppliers with btc, btc is not a currency of commerce, yet. It will get there, but This volatility is not conducive for commerce.

As long as you keep your income in bitcoins or cash, your more than likely safe. However, many people that underreported their income get caught when their bank deposits exceeds their reported income. At this point, the burden of proof is on you to report the income.
