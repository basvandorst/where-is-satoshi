It's a bit chewy, I can hardly get a bite out of it

Is it a secret that bitcoin is massively speculation-driven?  This doesn't seem very surprising.

Come to if you want to view all the various propaganda from a safe distance. :-)

Unless... that was his secret plan all along?!
Dun dun duuunnn!

75% is actually a pretty high threshold for a supermajority (two-thirds is more common IME).

There is a reasonably well-known quote about how easy it is to lie with statistics.
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:58:48


Are you saying there's still such a node out there?  Is there a story behind this?  I'm intrigued.

I've seen a few people selling up on the back of this incident.  Usual story. :-)
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:07:15
I wasn't accusing you of lying, just pointing out that people will be suspicious due to all the vast numbers of people who _do_ lie with statistics.  One could read your comment above as stating that it's impossible for statistics to lie, which isn't the case. :-)

What a coincidence!  It would have been far easier for everyone else as well.

We're running a bit low, but I have a spare if you need one:
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:18:21
Needs more sheeple.
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:03:10
Damn, you caught me out! :-)

A pseudonym is just a name.  Whether you use that to "dissociate your true self" or just to keep your real-world name away from doxxers and the like is up to the user.
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:56:28
This was my theory too. :-)

We can't ban the best shitposter in the whole sub!  This is an outrage, we should go on strike IMO

You are witnessing the glorious beauty of birth, friendo

Doge is in vogue

I assume "blockchain without decentralisation" means they're retaining the chain of hashes.

Did that dogecoin moon mission ever actually arrive?  I couldn't make heads or tails of the company's website but I don't think they've launched.

Lead also usually has some lead in it.

Are you insane.
