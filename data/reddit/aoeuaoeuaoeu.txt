They split your donation between all the nodes, you could grab the list and do the math yourself. the fee is for the transaction on the network not their cut or anything, they offer full transparency.

Not at all, the IP will update. Check out the Relay FAQ here: 
@_date: 2016-03-20 08:39:26
They send it to more recieving addresses so the transaction takes up more kilobytes on the blockchain, thus needs more fees to get confirmed.
@_date: 2016-03-19 00:24:32
sure wait until they spend it, or you know look up the owner of the public relays IP.

But if there are no sellers or buyers in Germany how do you use the site even if you can access it.
@_date: 2015-03-27 08:15:48
Yes there is search leetcoin on steam aswell as post in the leetcoin chat page and message the admins once we get a few people in it spreads that there is money to be won.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:17:39
Not really as the coins will follow the trail in the blokckchain, the amount would stay the same and if slim shady rats on you you need to prove who you sent the coins to, better method is darkwallet
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:23:43
If a seller is keeping copies of the JPG on his personal computer that is irresponsible.

Darkwallet got raided by the DHS for money laundering and bitcoins will be auctioned off soon.

Do you want it? If so PM me.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:10:46
A trusted seller would not risk his profits and following by fucking over his customers, would i send my selfie to any one on localbitcoins not really I rather pay a bit of a markup and get my coins via a anonymous bank deposit
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:52:15
The promo server is a quarter of a penny 10 bits is 1000 satoshi and the actual gambling server is 2.5 cents a kill right now 100 bits per death aswell. The promo server doesnt cost to die.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:48:32
But it won't hold up in the court of law at all, just because I used this bitcoin to buy something that then was traded to a terrorist does not make the one funding the terrorist, If I used my bitcoins to donate to ISIS who then bought Guns with BTC and used that then they can come after me.
Also coinbase is an exchange lol 
@_date: 2015-03-16 10:59:30
and would be better help
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:07:35
But why is it not pushed to the testnet, or used in the github builds he should open it up for more developers.
@_date: 2015-03-22 07:40:53
All currencies they have it posted publicly via API, you can run your own scrapper or use a publicly available internet interface.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:05:58
I don't understand the whole GBTC, why not just buy bitcoin or trade directly on an exchange?

Unless you over use a custom bootloader as well to skip the dev check.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:32:40
Your logic kinda fails here, if I buy bananas at my local grocer and he pays employees with the same 5 dollar bill, who then buys some pot, will the cops come after me for funding drug dealers?
Once it hits the exchange the money is shared between all users of that exchange.
@_date: 2015-03-22 09:18:34
The proposed 20Mb blocks fix this problem.
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:43:06
You want to keep your privacy by using a triangulationable radio signal over the ability to use TOR or a VPN and the instant speed of the internet?

Online tumblers are really just someone else's wallet that mixes for you, why not just skip the middle man and use darkwallet and the coinjoin exchange for privacy.

Just registered root and postmaster with security like this lets see how long they last.
For NetSec noobies those emails would allow me to take over the domain rather quickly.

Should have made a backup for the client before hand and had proper antimalware protections in place, a good IT technician wants to make sure they never see their clients again.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:04:35
We need to fix the 1MB network cap as that seems to be the most pressing bottleneck aside from adoption for our network to grow.
@_date: 2016-05-03 05:46:48
The problem with forcing a downgrade as you are the strongest tower locally, is as simple as saying no other networks available.
As for the speeds if you route it to your normal LTE connection but with DNS injection you could do whatever you want. 
Also you are not safe from your ISP, they use supercookies to track you.

You don't even have a name and you want us to give you money, invest 10 bucks into a website maybe and why the fuck would a developer pay to include his app in your store.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:38:09
Two fucking mistakes, TAILS is not more secure then a fully offline Ubuntu PC, all it is is more anonymous.
Also the printer you are using will store the private key in its memory buffer where it can be recovered later.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:54:32
Yes but consensus is defined by the full nodes of the network.
@_date: 2015-03-16 11:26:50
It already is tribally easy this forces merchants to protect themselves please read gavin's view on it.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:09:11
But if you are day trading, then the exchange becomes your bank.
You do not need to hold the private keys yourself.
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:06:30
This is a good thing.
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:58:21
Add your name to the list I bet there are a few that are looking for anonymous cash selling and buying.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:02:54
Nodes can refuse to relay successful blocks my those mining thus ruining network propagation for that mining pool until they allow the 20mb cap.

If I send my trader the cash in Japan how would he deposit in Canada without changing it to bitcoin and sending it to a Canadian trader first?
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:52:01
Now you just funded them hacking several other computers, so much for helping a client. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:10:42
Or maybe you can use the events to spread crypto like PGP and pidgin+OTR and bitcoin instead of being a pessimistic fucktard.
@_date: 2015-03-27 08:50:19
Sadly no but you can get free coins in the promo server right now.
@_date: 2015-03-16 13:28:41
If your wallet did this by default that would be awesome, as attempting to double spend just wastes the attackers money.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:45:59
Might as well just blow your head off now, I mean not like we stopped SOPA and the rest before. Fuck your apathetic political viewpoint

Malware would flash the custom bootloader and then be able to create custom transactions that mimic legitimate ones.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:20:28
Sounds correct, don't know if anyone managed to root a trezor and replace it with custom firmware.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:46:11
Sure send me the private key + public key and we shall see how it stands up to my server farm.
But yes an offline TAILS is just as secure as any other linux or freebsd operating system.

So alice only gets 0.75 and will never get the last 25% but Bob can take that money once he decides its not worth it anymore. Also once the song is decrypted what stops him of dumping the song from ram and sharing a DRM free version.-
Face it copyrights for potentially infinite material like information are illogical.

coinmap.org should get your giftcard.
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:29:26
It kinda already does just ask the the sender to fund a local cash deposit in their country, then sell the BTC on your side of the world.
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:14:03
There already is a API for selling and trading.

Assuming it's only one phone EDGE can carry a bandwidth up to 500  kbit/s which I would not be able to tell unless torrenting on my Phone.

It is the official changetip source code you just have to compile and run the bot in your channel on your own right now.

I don't really care about market cap, I would only consider jumping ship if the altcoin has more adoption for day to day sales, like in person brick and mortar stores
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:56:36
Trezor can be safely plugged into a compromised machine without exposing your private keys. BUT it cannot safely spend as the transaction data can me changed going in making you send your bitcoin to an attackers address instead of where you wanted it to go.
Paperwallets also should be stored securely one copy on normal printer paper can degrade or burn/get wet. Multiple backups on laminated paper encrypted would be better.
Tails is not designed for security as much as for anonymity and privacy. You can still get malware installed and you bitcoins stolen. Also signing onto nonHTTPS websites over TOR is a huge security risk.

Canada doesn't have a Guantanamo, you are literally to stupid to explain how ownership of coin becomes null after just 2 links, I mean 40% of the current bitcoin in circulation have been used on a darknet market, and I bet you can trace that within 4 hops.
