"If a picture is worth 1,000 words, then a series of pictures showing a repeating pattern must be worth 1,000,000. It seems to me that there is a largely overlooked BTC crash pattern that takes place every year (for the past 4 years) which happens starting exactly 23-24 days before the Chinese New Year like clockwork each year."
Not sure if article is a repost

That must be taken with a grain of salt. The more the dollar inflates, the less it's worth. Sure, same is true with any fiat currency. However, we only issue new debt because of the trust in the stability of the dollar. If nations see the dollar is being printed too hastily and see it's going on an unsustainable path of maintaining its purchasing power, all they need to do is switch to another denomination. If and when the dollar is no longer the world's supercurrency then it's over for us. That's why we invade every county that threatens our denomination and it's value

It's not about anything other than monetizing green movement. It's already happening. Green is cheaper than oil. Oil is dying. Capture technology will become big money. It's not a hope, it's factual science. Don't sweat it, it's not Hollywood

Fraking? Um renewable resources are winning. They already won. All old school energy is out in a few decades. You realize co2 removal will be big money right? As in, making laws to control how low it goes? Stop thinking short term with emotion. Use logic for technical advancement

I tell people this to no end, and to no avail. People are apathetic, the end. We deserve illuminati shit against us. Theres always a cycle of government, anarchy, republic, democracy, socialism, corporatocracy, oligarchy, totalitarianism, revolt, anarchy. We're getting there.. I agree 60 years max. The day we can't pay our interest on our debt, say goodbye to the dollar

Ok hot shot, please explain how the USA will pay it's debt when it rises too high for the GDP to cover even only the interest accumulation.
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:18:56
While I respect your knowledge on the subject, it is simply impossible for any debtor to continue buying our debt when our the interest on our debt alone rises above the annual GDP. There is simply no debating that point, because at THAT point it will require massive printing or creating new virtual currency, which other nations will take notice, meaning inflation will ramp up significantly, as well as the rating on our debt which will no longer be AAA. All those factors combined to make the dollar less trustworthy will ultimately send it tumbling down once it's no longer the world's supercurrency. That day will come, mark my words. You think they're printing all this money and making a killing on the fee they charge for e very dollar for nothing? They're riding the money train to the ground

Umm McDonald's is definitely less likely to go away than the American dollar. The moment our debt gets high enough that the interest on that principle cannot be paid, the dollar goes away, especially as world choice. What, 20-30 years tops? The elites that run the reserve etc are running it dry and cashing out big time.. letting it crash so the world turns to some new world order denomination. Wake up man, McDonald's has higher standards than the dollar

Just look at how the frb was created, all the warnings our founding fathers gave us, all the countries that resisted central banks, and especially jfk and executive order to bring back gold standard

You're dodging the question. Our debt is accepted because we can pay the interest and payments are stable. Once we can't pay interest, there is no longer a sustainable way to pay off ANY debt. Sure , we can print more money, or sell off our assets like army infrastructure. But how long would that buy us? You have no solution to that problem, that no debt is sustainable without being able to pay interest accrument, let alone principle.
