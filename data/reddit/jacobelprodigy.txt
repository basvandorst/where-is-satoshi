An engineered breakpoint, just keep that in mind. I believe Bitcoin is the result of great free market entrepreneurs. But like our friend here, I too believe it's too much of a threat to be left alive. I believed that when it first came about. I also believe Bitcoin will save millions of people from total insolvency in the near future. I have quite a bit of $ riding on that.

If your friend had already owned Bitcoins, you could have created a wallet in seconds and been paid in under 10 minutes. Just like if you hadnt already owned fiat AND a bank account, that wouldn't have been any easier. The lesson: set up a bitcoin account *before* you need it.

In short, I think if U.K. remains in the EU the value of Bitcoin will go higher  because of the halving. If you don't remain in, the pound will suffer, the Euro will suffer, your money was better in Bitcoin. You're looking at higher risk *not* converting. The vote will be decided three weeks prior to the halving. You could escape all halving uncertainty once the vote is in, if it's a stay vote.

It's exactly the same as when you buy and sell stock. Yes it can be tedious, that's what accountants are for. There's one difference though *if* a bitcoin happened to leave your public trade account and make it into some dark corner, you report the sale at the time of transfer. At that moment, you've sold it. ..So a world where bitcoin is accepted for payment everywhere becomes... Much much cheaper if you understand your tax incentives.. Always pay your **sales taxes** ladies and gentlemen.

I believe in BTC for this. I've concluded that main street loves their inflatable fiat. Let them keep it. Heck I'll use it too, in small quantities for mundane purchases. I only need my Bitcoins for travelling across borders easily and to maintain and (since I'm an early adopter) grow value. I *understand* those that want it to be the *only* currency used everyday for everything. I also understand and believe that Core is using this all down to keep fees. No matter what happens to the limit, and God willing it does go up, my BTC will be held long. I see it as digi gold and a savings account. That's exactly how I plan to use it. Refute if you want gents, but I feel that my opinion represents quite a bit of middle ground for an average person that is not a developer. Until the network CAN sustain daily use, this mentality should be seen as a blessing.

Soros and other big players might disagree with you there. Multiple billionaires have recently moved out of all stocks (and therefore dollars) save gold mining and gold efts, while shorting the market and buying hundreds of millions in gold bullion. The fed is preparing to announce they can't raise rates. Hyper inflation may be a reality soon if QE re convenes. I'd say the dollar is now a risky investment. What's that the farmer said when the cow died? "She's never done that Before!" I stole that from someone saying how Bitcoin could die, but I feel it's better used here ;)

I'm pretty sure that's going to be your fastest route. Verification on an exchange is going to take you about a week or two.. Plus a few days to move funds. Coin Base is your fastest bet and using wires to get into some exchanges is a real pain the first go. I'd use the checking account direct option of CoinBase, and maybe begin looking at poloniex, Kraken, etc. If you plan to continue buying/selling.

I completely understand how fractional reserve banking works. But they aren't refuting giving the money because they don't have it, they're refuting because of "terrorism." I doubt that my small sum request dents the 10% cash holding they have on hand, by law. This country has gone absurd with "security" and yet I never see thwarted attacks. The Patriot Act has been shown to stop exactly zero attacks. The NSA data collection has stopped exactly zero attacks. Being a pain about withdrawing money has stopped zero.

So you're saying that people losing faith in currency like we saw in the German Mark a hundred years ago *wouldn't* cause the value of Bitcoin to soar? I disagree. Where is my flawed thinking that people would quite suddenly reevaluate how *wonderful* the finite supply of Bitcoin is. The market cap of Bitcoin is *whatever everyone is willing to pay for it right now.* So upon a hyper inflationary event, that market cap would be Huge, fast. If I'm incorrect, please, educate me.

I hear you. I own PM's as well, but I see the quickest and most liquidation friendly method as bitcoin. Money all around the world would chase it. Good must be bought and owned BEFORE, and looking at recent crisis, good prices hardly fluctuate with economic uncertainty. Bitcoin wouldn't just double, like gold did post '08. It would exponentially multiply. But, a full fledge collapse would send gold (and silver) to the moon as well.

I believe the Canadians tried that in the 90's, I think they flavored them with maple syrup (ay!) Bernanke tried the "how much can I print before you realize you hardly have any pie left" approach. In 2016-2017 the Euro will be increased by 2/3rds MORE... The dollar has an unsure amount to be printed, but I'd say the writing is on the wall Worldwide. People think that just because someone is buying the treasury bonds, that doesn't mean they have less of the whole... Stupidity! Essentially, one pie cut 700 trillion times means you have less than one that's cut a thousand times.. This is why I have utter faith in bitcoin as long as China has electricity.
