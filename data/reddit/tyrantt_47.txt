This is everyone I work with that just learned what "bitcorn" is this last month. I try to engage in conversations about the technology, but the conversations I get are along the lines of:
Q: Haven't heard of TRX, what is the purpose of the coin?














Sigh.. I'm by no means any kind of crypto expert, not even by a long shot, but God damn people, research what you're investing in! Invest because you believe in the technology, not because you think it's gonna moon because it's one of the new top coins under $1

I got a new barber because of this. Back when 13k was the ath, I was talking crypto with my barber and he said that I convinced him to buy 2 btc.

Sorry, I was referencing the other graphs that stopped short. I'm assuming they stopped short due to a decline
For example, the land-line stops at 2005 at the start of a decline in the graph. Keep the graph going and going to 2018, that line should be close to rock bottom
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:42:54

And those people would still be considered, but I also know more people who don't actually have landlines.

There's more tactful ways of going about it rather than attacking them by pointing out that they are asking a personal question. Not only that, but by being so defensive about it, you're essentially telling them that you're invested enough in crypto to get so defensive in regards to a simple question.

Wallets &gt; deposit &gt; currency type USD coin &gt; and then it only gives me a wallet address to deposit into. I don't see where I have the option to select a bank account.


I linked one on coinbase, is it different for pro?
Edit: I can click coinbase account, but I would have to purchase on CB first and then wait a week before I can deposit into pro, which is pretty inconvenient
Edit 2: if I select USD, I can make a deposit from my bank account, but it says that I wont see the funds until it clears my bank. So it sounds like I'll have to wait 3 to 7 days before I can trade with it, which is again, inconvenient. I don't mind what Gemini did where you had access to the funds, but couldn't withdraw until it cleared your bank. But not having access to trade until it clears is annoying

Part 1. This happened to me when I was 17 (10 years ago) and living on my own. Went to the bank to pull out cash for rent and asked if I had any pending charges prior to pulling the money out. They told me I didn't and I got the money and moved on with my day. 1 week later I look at my bank account and saw I was -$500. I asked them what the fuck that was about and they told me that I pulled out money when I had 3 charges of $3, $5, and $12. Each of those charges were $35 each PER FUCKING DAY. I overdrafted by $20 and they charged me $500 when they were the ones who told me I had no pending charges. I tried to argue with the manager and all he said he could do was waive 50%. Being young and naive I accepted the loss, but didn't eat very well for awhile after that. 
Part 2.  Joined the military a year later and during boot camp they made us check our bank balance on an Atm to make sure we were getting paid. I went into the military with a 0 balance. Turned out I was not getting paid and the $5 charge to look at my balance out me into overdraft. However, this time I  ouldnt do anything about it since I was at boot camp. At the end of boot camp I had over $1000 in overdraft fees from being charged $35 a day while I was in overdraft. I argued with them that it was bullshit that I was fined one thousand fucking dollars for checking my bank balance whole I was in boot camp and had no choice to wait until after to deal with it. They ended up waiving these fees and told me all was good. I asked them if it would hurt my credit because of this and they told me no. 6 years later when buying a house I had only one Ding on my credit. It was fucking them. I appealed it and it was wiped out. 
I was stupid to not switch banks after part 1 (was young and dumb and thought it would be the same problem at other banks) but after boot camp I immediately switched banks. 
Fuck Wells Fargo. I hope the rest of their lives are as pleasant as they are.

Question for you, I signed up and was verified, but it appears that you have to withdraw money from your bank account before you can buy btc. Os this accurate? Of so, it seems ridiculous that you can't buy in a dip because it would take too long to get that cash into your account before you can buy btc. I like coinbase because you can buy an X amount and have it pulled straight from your bank or cc
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:20:52
I hear ya man. My bank is online only and has maybe 2 physical locations. I have no clue what to do with cash when I get it cause I hate carrying it around (which is what I ultimately have to do).
