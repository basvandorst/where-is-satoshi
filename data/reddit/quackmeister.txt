Not sure about wealth management specifically... I meant for general banking.

The irony is that RBC is still closing accounts of companies/individuals buying &amp; selling cryptocurrency.

To be sycophantic, you look lovely today.

There’s a Linux utility called [ssss]( that is pretty easy to use.

I guess I should clarify that we're using this in more of an institutional context w/ multi-sig wallets. We'd have to completely lose 3 pieces each for multiple keys for the funds to be unrecoverable - and given how we store things this is highly unlikely. I believe Coinbase does something similar with their wallets.

We have filtering in place to check email addresses for validity - mostly it catches typos, but it also will reject emails from disposable email providers. Occasionally it messes up on custom domains depending on the configuration of your email provider’s SMTP server. We do actually track this and it thankfully doesn’t happen very often.
Could your shoot support another email so I can have a look? It’s possible that got missed on a high-volume day when we were getting flooded with new account signups.

Newton CEO here! (my spidey sense was tingling)
Our bid &amp; ask prices are transparent and always listed on [our website]( These aren't promotional prices - our goal is to drive fees and prices right into the ground to spur faster crypto adoption.
We have a sophisticated market-making operations going on behind the scenes, so even at tight spreads we're making money on every trade. The guys making this happen are reformed futures traders who saw the light.
As for Plaid, we use it for two things: a) rapid identity verification for KYC/AML, and b) bank connection for pre-authorized debit and EFTs. We never see or handle any banking credentials, and Plaid is used across North America by some really big names (including Wealthsimple in Canada).

Newton CEO here! We moved to a [new custody provider]( recently, and there are still a few intermittent bugs we're ironing out around our hot wallets. The new custodian supports many more coins than we were able to support previously.
If you email support with your account details we can get that sorted for you quickly.

Keep in mind that Stephen Poloz is retiring next year, so any forward-looking statements need to be taken with a grain of salt. The next BoC Governor may have different views.

Was editorializing the headline even necessary? Remember: dogs are the one true master, and now US Senate moves forward with Bill... and Bill’s easing regulations on banks!

Do you also need the Kwik-E-Mart?

Trezors only have a single microcontroller with no secure element.
There's a good teardown here:

The more secure alternative would be a Ledger Nano S - they store private keys in a separate secure element that should be immune to most attacks. Trezor devices can be compromised more easily.

They also accept tears of Mormon guilt.

It auto-respawns, which makes it an excellent currency.  You’ll always have some on hand!
Though I suppose that would make it an inflationary currency... still, the Mormon central bank can correct for that by varying guilt interest rates.

I always found it funny when people would say authoritatively “I hear it’s going down to $3000!”
Basically they heard some talking head on CNBC and assumed their prediction was better than a monkey with a dart board.
