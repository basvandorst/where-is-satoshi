I found encrypted data in your post, which contains your information, seems like you've configured everything wrong, might replace two of modems with each other.

So, no brute-force protection wasn't Apple's fault?

Browsing your profile, and can't find any proof you're Satoshi, yet I still believe you, no idea why :/
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:59:07
Lets do it, I guess?

I've been reading all tech news for past two weeks, and didn't notice anything about PayPal. Thanks for posting going to search.

NOTE: Google translate isn't best option, it would best idea to get someone who ACTUALLY can read chinese to translate that.
ALSO: You can manipulate sent-date if you own server with email service, nothing "future" here.
Edit: Seems like that's either some order invoice or spam. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 12:09:15
In picture it was 298 and some chinese text, no zeroes, so no idea if OP is lieing or it was like 298 thousands.
Either way it isn't from future, could have been sent months ago.

You can buy same performance laptop for lower price.

There was python script which could brute-force. Apple patched it too. So there was exploit, but there's no proof brute-force was used in this case, but it is very likely as that exploit is very very old.

You realise there was 5 emails from same day  because it shows hour:minute not date just before that one on top?
That one is using month/day/year
Edit: If that isn't enough for you, here you go: 
Edit2: No bashing, just proving my facts, so false info doesn't spread.

Either It's **22, it can be 1922 or 2022 or perhaps 2322.
On other hand, you got 2122 from other source?
Edit: If you set date to 2122-12-06 on server with email server, it will send email with that date.

Using VisualBasic GUI I managed to track you,you're indeed Satoshi.
Anyone want his location?
@_date: 2014-09-09 12:26:57
Or he bought video-tape. No idea.
@_date: 2014-09-09 12:28:49
His source for information was completely false. It's something about 298 yuan (48.56 USD / 37.67 EURO / 0.10427 BTC ) and *puppet pen video* - no idea, used google translate.

Fact local bank transferring to local costs ~10 times more than it should by law, while transfering to paypal, steam etc. costs nothing, is silly.
