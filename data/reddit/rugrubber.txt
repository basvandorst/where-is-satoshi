And that's all you can answer as you realize i'm totally right and you are out of excuses. Sad. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:40:03
It's fine. It's always a good indication of how desperate this sub is. And boy, it is desperate lately. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:05:07
I have no idea. All i know that they won't turn to Bitcoin. Which anyone with a working brain will understand. 
No amount of downvotes will change that. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:56:58
A few lifetimes. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 09:04:55
Coincidence yes. 
Ah yes. Downvoted because people don't like the answer. It HAS to be people buying coins because of this amaaaaaazing news. Anything else is not allowed and must be downvoted.

1 for one don't go through someone's account in pure rage to see how old it is if he says something i don't like. You know why? Because i don't care if it's 2 minutes old or 2 years. I only care about what he has to say. 
But the reason why it's hard to keep an account here is that you get automatically shadow banned after x amount of downvotes. And since it's impossible to say something here that goes against the circle jerk without getting downvoted to oblivion you are forced to either praise Bitcoin in every post or keep using new accounts. 
Bitcoiners hate new accounts yet their insane amount downvoting is the reason for so many new accounts. 
Now watch me getting downvoted.

they went from 2 to 8 users. Get ready for "Chile is mass adopting Bitcoin" upvoted to the mainpage twice a day. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:29:29
Hilarious. So after 6 years it turns out Bitcoin shouldn't be used for payments. 
Right. Ok well, i guess you now can start convincing everyone for the next 6 years how they should start using Bitcoin for settlements. By the time everyone figures out that won't work either i'm sure you'll come up with a new goal. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:04:42
No way there are still people using them. Nobody can be that dumb. I'm sure. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 10:15:24
Yeah kiddo, i'm so enraged. Never been so enraged in my life. 
Anyway, also no answer. And we both know why. 
Do you have any idea how pathetic you people look to outsiders who visit this sub for the first time?
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:17:16
God, the price goes up 5 bucks and this sub turns completely euphoric again. It's the same thing every 2 weeks when the price gets pumped before the dump. 
15 downvotes. Quite amazing. You know desperation is peaking when bitcoiners go in full rage downvote mode. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 09:48:40
Tell me, do you think OP's story is real or fake?
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:55:51
No. I've been told for years it's no problem whatsoever. Any mention of potential problems resulted in mass downvotes. 
We know that Bitcoiners would never lie so it simply isn't a problem. Please stop talking about it. Bitcoin is working perfectly fine. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:03:04
Don't worry. Bitcoin won't be used by 7 million people. You really don't have to worry about that. 
And downvoted of course. Because there is only one answer allowed here. Bitcoin WILL be used by 7 billion people. Mention anything else in the echo chamber and the cult will rage downvote you. 
As i mentioned just minutes ago desperation is absolutely peaking. Poor bagholders. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 10:05:26
Since he won't answer why don't you answer me? Is his story real or fake? What do you think?
Did 10 to 15 come up to him to ask about Bitcoin? And where all those people intrigued by his explanation?
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:54:46
There are tons of payment options for tons of currencies and e-moneys. Of which many have more users than Bitcoin. Do they have to add them all because "it has to start somewhere"?
There is no reason whatsoever for them to add Bitcoin. Just like they won't accept Zimbabwean dollars. Why do you refuse to understand this? 
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:34:36
And they're not gonna move to Bitcoin. Believe me, they won't. 
Yes, downvoting will magically make it less true. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:44:43
Because nobody uses it. This seems amazingly hard to understand for a big group of people here. 
the reason you just don't understand why a company wouldn't use Bitcoin is because you are emotionally and financially invested in Bitcoin. The rest of the world outside this sub doesn't use Bitcoin and isn't thinking for even a second about how they could accept it in their store. 
It is not weird that a company doesn't care about Bitcoin. It's completely normal. 
Edit: it would be so nice if we could discuss things here without getting downvoted all the time. Is this what you do in real life as well? If someone says something you don't like you just put your fingers in your ear and scream nanananana till it goes away?
