sorry but this says it all. you are driven by your emotions. thats not uncommon, statistically most private investors buy high and sell low. this is even intrinsic to the price. the price is high because lots of people want to buy and the price is low because lots want to sell. so you see you are part of a crowd emotionally driven by fear and excitement. i did my mistakes too, but now i tend to tie my wrists and look at the long term. I speculate that bitcoin is a new emerging technology and i invest each week a certain amount automatically withdrawn from my bank account, regardless of the current price. this and looking at my own special chart keeps me calm.

I know that its incorporated in English, although I believed that its a pure American thing, as "uber", "schadenfreude" etc.
I believe "Gestalt" came into the English speaking countries because Carl Jung used it in his psychology/ ideology, the year of origin (1920s) in your link supports this. 
I welcome "Killer app's" transformation towards "feature", it makes a lot of sense to me.

your argument was mine for some months now (metcalfes law, etc.) , but this is a prediction on a thing that is not deterministic. So at least say that there is a chance, or there are scenarios where bitcoin will be surpassed by another coin. You can't believe it's set in stone.

network effects are great, but the more miners invest and the more miners are there, the more exchanges and wallet run bitcoin code the harder it is to make changes on the Bitcoin protocol. You can crash the economy in a day by bugs in the code, code could get rejected by important players. 
TL;DR: you don't simply copy improvements into the bitcoin protocol
