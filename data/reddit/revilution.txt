They vary week to week, two dividends ago was 0.036 per share, last dividend was 0.0208 per share. Next week's dividend should be higher due to hardware sales.

0.02 or 0.2? The former seems very realistic (maybe even slightly lowballed) while the latter, being an 8% weekly dividend seems a tad optimistic

Ah, my mistake then; I was not aware that that was an option.
If you're more concerned with a dollar based ROI than I wouldn't worry as I strongly believe bitcoin dollar valuation will rise in the short-medium term future.

A weak hand is one who sells their bitcoins at the slightest hint of a price drop. It is a derogatory term concerning those who are too skittish and fiat profit oriented to hold on to their bitcoins through stormy waters.
That being said, you are NOT a weak hand since your buying of fiat is temporary and wisely pre-planned (at a higher price than we are now).
I wish you luck in your future bitcoin endeavors!

He is right, I put in x amount of USD a couple of months ago expecting to be able to take out that same x amount, but when it came time to buy some fiat, I had 5x instead of x! It didn't store my (fiat) value at all, just multiplied it.

It doesn't make any sense to me to keep track of ROI of something that you paid for in bitcoin to be in anything but bitcoin! If you were to spend 100btc on an asic and ultimately only earn 80btc back, that's theoretically a loss since you would have had "more" (general term) had you simply held on to the 100btc.
Like Yifu said in the [interview for vice]( he closed the loop - you pay in btc for something that generates btc; the dollar value is irrelevant.
Also, as an afterthought, if you were to keep track of ROI in fiat, how would you do it? What would be your initial expense on the miner? Would it be, for example, 100btc * how many $ you paid for each btc, or 100btc * how much each btc was worth at the moment you submitted, or other?
Personally, I'm just going to keep it simple and start doing all of my mining related accounting in terms of btc. Buying that asic still puts my usd-btc equivalent worth above what I initially put in, so for me, the loop truly is closed.

Again, pts and direct shares each have their benefits. For small amounts of shares pts would probably be better since liquidity isn't a huge issue for 10 shares and they're easier to manage when someone else does it for you. The problem with pts is that it introduces an attack vector (if the exchange where your pts are held is compromised, you could potentially be screwed. I know btct has in-case-of-emergency plan where even if the site was compromised, Friedcat would know which pts belong to which bitcoin address as long as you have a withdrawal address specified on the site). That's actually another benefit of full shares over partial shares (at least on btct) if the site disappears, partial share holders are screwed while full shareholders should still be able to have their shares as long as they can prove that they control the withdrawal address specified on the site.

@_date: 2013-05-16 21:46:34
Each has their pros and cons and I own some of both myself. 
The full are good because they can be exchanged for direct shares easily and because afaik they aren't charged a management fee (at least on btct, not sure about bitfunder) so you get 100% of dividends every week. The problems with the full shares are that they are relatively expensive (~1.75btc each) and not very liquid.
The partial shares are good because they're cheaper and you aren't restricted to spending in multiples of 1.75btc and they're more liquid than their full share counterparts. The problem with partial shares is that they cannot be easily converted to direct shares (you'd have to sell your partial shares, buy the full shares, then transfer them out while paying transaction fees every step of the way) as well as having the 5% management fee meaning that you only get 95% of weekly dividends.

I recently upgraded to 0.8.1 and syncing took me a total of 3-6 hours, I believe, whereas on 0.8.0 it took closer to 48 hours. I personally use bitcoinqt as I want to run a full node and because it's pretty simple to use.

Avalon claims that they are not planning on producing a fourth batch. Whether they actually will or not, no one knows.
The closest thing to comparable units is butterfly labs, but their record has been... spotty at best (The units meant to have been shipped in October 2012 are just 4-6 weeks away, as they have been since September 2012)

The usd value of bitcoin only matters to me as a means to take out my initial investment (which is about 1/5 of my current holdings). The amount of btc in my hot wallet is equivalent to my initial investment/price per bitcoin and the rest of the bitcoins I have invested in various bitcoin-generating ventures (a couple stocks and an incoming miner).
I plan on closing the loop of bitcoin/fiat soon (once the price hits $250/btc) so that even if the value of bitcoins goes to 0 I will not have any realized losses.

Not enough conclusive evidence to make that claim in my opinion. It's evidence that there is at least one single entity that is willing and able to cash out, in one sitting, piles of their fiat for bitcion.

No one has ever went broke taking profits or something like that. If one is using btc as an investment vehicle as opposed to a currency, having an exit plan is important and should not be ridiculed.
