Magic internet money is way easier to explain to family/friends/coworkers though. Half of the people I've been forced to explain it to can't get past the concept of how money is created out of "nothing."

That's my take on it. I feel like SegWit (and LN) can help increase adoption which hopefully would mean more valuable coins and more (albeit smaller) fees. It seems too late to take the hobbyist approach to btc and that if upgrades aren't made then the price will stagnate. Higher distribution of coins means higher value.

Exactly. :D

Not disagreeing with the numbers but the scaling on the y-axis is atrocious.

It's a network issue. There were a few blocks earlier today with low tx count and all day there's been inconsistent block spacing. As of right now there have been 5 blocks in 2 hours and 200sat is at a 7 block delay.

Everybody is so eager to get their hands on BCH. Not that they will be able to do anything with them right now.

There's localbitcoins but you won't like the prices...

I used to be worried about the banks clamping down on cryptos but they will tolerate it as long as there's a profit to be made.

If you know when to mine instead of constantly devoting energy you can still get the block reward without the additional electricity cost.

I would recommend localbitcoins. There are a number of options available for quick purchases.

You're welcome. Make sure if you're going to buy with one of the higher-risk funding options that you only do so from someone with a stellar rating. Best of luck!

If you just buy Bitcoin and hodl it you are not subject to any taxes. The risk of not reporting any profits/losses if you ever sold them would be if the IRS subpoenas the exchange for customer records with the blockchain leaving a trail of where the coins were transferred from.

It varies from bank to bank. I think Wells Fargo will close your account for Coinbase transactions.

Crypto markets/transactions peak during Monday - Friday, with the weekends being down time where backlog is cleared (typically by mid-Sunday. This usually also correlates with a price drop on the weekends. Also, as mentioned before, there has been a noticeable drop in transactions that appear to be spam intended to push fees higher.
