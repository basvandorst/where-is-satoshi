Do you honestly believe bitcoin can reach its full potential without initially winning over some of the DC bozos?
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:16:15
No, 'we' need to do it.
We cannot provide all of the money for a lobbyist, however we are more than willing to chip in where we can.
As for management of it, we are not appropriate candidates as we are in the UK
@_date: 2014-05-13 23:25:13
I think in reality it would be more like 3%.
They really didn't make a clear point about the people running the ATM choosing the fee.
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:54:57
Indeed, not just to counter what mastercard is doing but to push our own agendas. For example pushing the idea of BitLicenses that are nation wide instead of done on a state-by-state basis.
@_date: 2014-04-29 11:43:17
I can confirm this is legitimate. Withdrawals are working.
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:28:43
So is that what you want it to become? I personally imagine a scenario where everyone gets to benefit from it.
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:15:03
Money also speaks louder to politicians than action.
@_date: 2014-05-17 18:04:55
As far as I can see we are the first serious one
@_date: 2014-06-10 10:39:40
I don't think Blockchain.info even has the information, it is purged. Also DarkWallet is ran by Amir, no concerns there. Also I think it is trustless as it uses ring signatures (if I remember correctly)
@_date: 2014-05-05 20:29:41
Depends on the amount of RAM you have and the config of the server. Sometimes they aren't needed.
@_date: 2014-05-18 18:18:54
Granted, but thats already the case. If you come in from Pakistan you are already treated differently. This passport just shows you are both from Pakistan and wealthy.
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:59:34
You wouldn't trust bank staff to know about one massive law which effects almost all of their customers? Thats ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-05-17 15:36:43
At banks there is recourse though. You can chargeback the transactions (including bank transfers in many cases).
I prefer bitcoin, but I *don't* want people relying on this because it is insured.
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:17:13
Nope, that still uses legacy infrastructure. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:56:23
The majority of hashing power is not small computing power, its hundreds of gigahash systems. So as far as decentralization goes it is irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-06-06 09:12:14
Its just demonstrating what would happen if even one country were to use it.
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:02:36
Everyone here is still definitely an early adopter.
@_date: 2014-05-15 19:34:39
Except as I said, they most likely have large cash reserves.
@_date: 2014-05-17 15:51:06
We at Mimex pledge 5% of our profits to the automated foundation once it has been created. We see it as an important step towards the acceptance of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:17:56
144p seems fair, in 8 bit colour.
@_date: 2014-05-10 22:57:22
Moore's law has been pronounced on a monthly basis since it was conceived.
And yes, of course. The company needs to make profits, however currently the market is a complete oligopoly, and America is being outpaced by a vast quantity of the globe. Of course you do have some disadvantages such as the sheer amount of land to cover.
I can understand the other side, but if I was a US citizen I can't *make* any services I want to use pay every single network to not be throttled. Its just another way to fuck the consumer over.
If you had 40 companies providing data capabilities in the US, I might say getting rid of net neutrality is not the worst thing in the world. But the companies have so far shown they are willing to squeeze every last drop out of the consumer. You just know they will now be doing the same to businesses too.
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:51:05
p2pools are incentivized above all pools with fees.
So all pools but GHash
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:05:57
One is very much on the way, one month best case scenario. (Yes, UK bank)
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:25:12
I don't think your Grandma would go to the hassle of buying bitcoins if she had to have a background check.
@_date: 2014-06-09 19:12:06
blockchain.info, DarkWallet... Just a couple of examples. Probably more.
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:43:54
If you keep all of your bitcoins on your phone, you are doing it wrong.
@_date: 2014-05-13 00:25:43
One is coming for the UK.
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:51:12
No, because we're assuming they have cash reserves to cover the drops in price.
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:11:32


@_date: 2014-05-11 21:01:22
Make an important political statement in 140 characters or less.
I don't know what we are expecting beyond leave bitcoin alone11!1
Unfortunately I don't think twitter is a good way of handling this.
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:50:38
$980,000 is not all that much money
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:35:24
Our exchange will not be open to US customers, nor am I expecting you to do anything.
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:26:06
The government will not get rid of KYC/AML requirements. It is far better for us to just make it more accommodating.
@_date: 2014-05-10 21:32:15
I think the problem is that people pay for a certain speed, with a certain data cap. They should be getting that, they are already paying for their telecoms provider to give them that speed for everything. Not every service that also pays the telecoms a premium.
Furthermore, in Europe telecoms providers give the same services, for far less money and (usually) better.
Plus, Moore's law seems to apply to internet backbone technology. Yes our demand has gone up, but so has their capability to supply it.
@_date: 2014-05-18 17:57:13
They don't report that you have the passport to your current country, so they won't actually know unless you show them the passport.
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:41:31
So you want bitcoin to just be for the black market?
@_date: 2014-05-15 18:53:57
They will still have a lot of cash reserves, plus most think we are about to go into a bull run.
@_date: 2014-05-15 20:39:24
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:10:02
As previously stated, one is on the way!
@_date: 2014-05-11 23:03:45
The last price rise was initially triggered by clarity on regulations.
@_date: 2014-06-06 09:32:01
That is the correct address, same one as shown in video description.
In case he edits it, that address is: 13v8NB9ScRa21JDi86GmnZ5d8Z4CjhZMEd
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:50:29
Urm, localbitcoins has been around for a while? Sure it might be a centralized website but the idea still stands. People have been doing that on every community available from bitcointalk to IRC for a long time.
@_date: 2014-05-01 15:07:07
Next it'll be no multi-continental payments.
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:53:48
Not just the TX hash but also sign from one of the input addresses.
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:24:12
So am I, I'm from the UK however the fact of the matter is that the US is a huge part of the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2014-05-21 20:56:37
I doubt it, Gold is not artificially scarce like diamonds are. Gold always has been and I imagine always will be valuable. 
Thats not a dig on BTC, thats just how I imagine it.
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:38:17
sudo apt-get install bitcoind
nano /root/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
This assumed an ubuntu server.
@_date: 2014-05-11 23:11:10
That looks like a very good start, however I think a more direct approach is needed.
@_date: 2014-05-18 18:17:54
I think it would be more accurate to say US/EU/UK commonwealth. But yes, if you are outside of that zone you are already treated differently.
@_date: 2014-05-15 18:22:40
You think our current whales would be happy with $980,000?
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:41:17
I think you over-estimate how much time and money hiring 5 lobbyists would take us. Also we're not talking about giving people already working on things this responsibility.
@_date: 2014-05-15 22:41:58
We're hopefully going to be having a stand at the London conference (insidebitcoins). Contemplating whether or not to say anything to Josh
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:39:30
I think thats what he means, sending $3000 in the mail is an awful idea.
@_date: 2014-05-11 23:02:53
Not to me, I'm suggesting that a group is made to handle political matters and people with a vested interest in bitcoin consider donating. In particular firms that wish to operate in the US
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:42:57
I wouldn't put it past them. We just need to make it more grandma friendly.
Like how the kindle tablets have made technology accessible to grandmas.
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:34:18
Your money isn't really insured. The insurance pays out if their wallets are hacked/stolen physically *not* if your account is breached
@_date: 2014-05-22 00:21:32
I know, but something being artificially scarce creates huge potential for value drops.
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:11:48
Very true, the number of cores wasn't really the point of the post though. It was more that we have the space and the server.
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:40:30
In which case we need to win over some of the people in DC.
They single-handedly have the ability to make or break bitcoin (as a currency).
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:51:52
p2pool has a higher difficult than most pools so small miners will struggle to even find a share.
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:15:08
Not a scam, its just they will be making an absolute truckload of cash every single time there is a price increase.
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:37:14
And it would be good if some could bring some Ghash
@_date: 2014-05-18 17:56:21
Did you have your family with you?
Was it your house, and were you making new friends?
@_date: 2014-05-21 20:47:19
Diamonds are worthless, they are a big scam.
Only expensive because of the mining cartel.
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:40:57
My home line is 100mbit down, 25mbit up.
I would suggest you upgrade your router, to possibly a enterprise router. Wouldn't be very pretty but would be worthwhile.
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:00:32
Maybe in the US it won't. In many other countries (in particular Europe) there is unlimited Internet with no fair usage policy. I personally average 500gb per month (I run 4 crypto nodes from my home)
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:29:09
We've just implemented it into our platform.
Not launching for another month though.
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:34:03
I bet you're looking forward to an alternative
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:51:42
If the price goes down they lose money. However I don't think you can say there hasn't been a longterm bull trend.
@_date: 2014-05-01 21:44:23
You've not been around here much recently, have you?
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:39:38
Thank you for the information, I am not fully informed on how the US political system works.
On an alternative note, if they change the classification to make it not an MSB, could they not implement this as an entirely separate system?
@_date: 2014-04-30 16:26:03
One is on the way, I can assure you.
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:18:17
One is on the way. I'm working on a UK exchange and we will also have an Australian bank
@_date: 2014-05-14 00:01:10
Supply and demand. No one has to use it.
@_date: 2014-05-18 18:12:53
Ah sure, well you won't get looked down upon for the passport. Its a commonwealth nation.
@_date: 2014-06-10 01:10:40
Neither of those are truly centralized. They get data from a central location but you still control the wallet.
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:56:24
3ghz Xeon cores, and I know. Unless of course you have a lot of complex mods that require database access. Of course at that stage you're talking about a lot of users
@_date: 2014-05-11 09:49:27
If you were getting 1BTC per day pool mining, you were very unlucky not to have got anything solo mining for 4 months.
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:29:31
Thats already done alot. People return items from shops, where does it go?
@_date: 2014-05-05 20:44:59
We have a spare 3u of rackspace and a spare 8 core 16gig server.
I guess the match is made.
