My suggestions is: don't all in when you feel you will earn a lot of money, it's similar to a gamble. However, I participated in a campaign called Micro Token Offering ([MTO]( presented by STP and win $500 worth Thunder Token with only $20 input. recently. This campaign is very interesting and I want to introduce this campaign to you.
MTO participants have a chance to buy high-quality project tokens with a 50% discount. Compared to IEO, MTO is more frequent and low cost. Every week a new project will be initiated and the minimum participation cost is as low as $2.
While IEO participants will take the risk of losing money, MTO secures the profit for participants because the rewards are US dollar-based. The winning chance of MTO is as high as over 40%, with more than 500 winners announced every week.
