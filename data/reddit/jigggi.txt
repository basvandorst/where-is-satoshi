Not related to that article but why factoids aren't on shapeshift? Blog post from spring informed that factom and shapeshift have partered but factoid still are not on shapeshift. Why is that?

No, windows

Yes, I actually sweeped it. I posted the private key on the right field and on "address" field was already one of my receiving addresses. Now it still seems to be empty. What is not correct?
@_date: 2015-06-05 13:27:03
Why does it do that? Makes no sense to me.

I know but I used bitcoin core few days ago and shouldn't take long to download block since then. Why it starts to download blocks from the beginning?

Why won't 21 begin to buy some bitcoins in market in order to increase price and increase media and consumer interest? They have received over 100 million funding and buying for example 10 millions dollars worth of bitcoins  wouldn't be a big deal for them but it would increase price significantly.

What does that matter if/when bitcoin is forking to classic?
@_date: 2016-01-17 23:34:14
If the community wants biggers blocks then there is supply for that. Ultimately at some point hard fork must be done. What would be better time to make that and see if it goes well? Bitcoin was meant to be scalable.

And we should discuss why we are losing it.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:19:20
Many of them are switching to bitcoin classic. Over 50% already in
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:37:04
Devs are not enough. Community needs to accept the fork. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:25:49
Few whales made pump. Nothing else.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:24:17
How is the most important thing to discuss off topic here?
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:12:29
So if bitcoin forks to bitcoin classic does every user need to update the original bitcoin core wallet?
@_date: 2016-01-26 18:55:32
When i try to make back up it says "wallet seed not available". How can i backup wallet? 
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:20:00
So is RBF also included in classic?
@_date: 2015-08-07 13:09:12
I think only decent one is bitpay's copay wallet.

Consequence would be continious inflation. Biggest pro in bitcoin is that supply is limited. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 14:24:24
How that hard fork can be bad if it's just what the major community wants?
@_date: 2016-02-02 12:59:52
After classic goes live core has zero jobs instread of one...

Bitcoin itself is becoming failed project, but technology behind it is amazing. Ethereum utilizes that technology much more efficiently and creates more applications around it. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 17:58:27
Core's plan is to make fee market that benefits blockstream which basically controls core. Bitcoin is meant to be decentralized so if  some bunch of people can control it that much it is very far from bitcoin's original idea. Community have clearly shown willingness to raise blocksize and if core doesn't do it then other developers will make the change and community adopts that protocol.

Ethereum is bitcoin's first killer app. I don't understand why so many hate ethereum. Objectively analyzing it's superior to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:07:23
Ethereum is more advanced cryptocurrency than bitcoin. It is not scam.
@_date: 2016-02-02 18:25:08
I would absolutely support core's scaling plan if it would include segwit in this spring and blocksize increase to 2mb later this year. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 15:49:13
Then bitcoin is failed project if such a simple scaling solution is too dangerous. At some point blocksize must be increased. Why not now?
