Nice article.

Lets get this set up....we will need your:
Address (physical, not mailing address)
Drivers license
National Identification number (SSN)
A copy of your birth certificate
A picture of yourself with the date, the working "for imatool exchange only" and  your signature.  Make sure not to cover your face in any way...and the file needs to be between 750kb and 752kb.  Anything else will be rejected by our servers for no apparent reason.
Did I miss anything people?

I agree.  It would be a trainwreck.  The best mitigation is prevention.

Ok everyone.
1) They want to use existing equipment.
2) While mining BTC requires ASICS these days, mining alts is good experience to have.
Mining helps decentralize mining and gets people involved that otherwise can't (lack of funds to buy directly, too young and parents won't let them buy...whatev).
By all means - try mining some coins.  You can keep them or trade for BTC on an exchange.  
Know this: 
*depending on the hardware, you will only get credited for a small amount each day.
*don't solo mine.  Find a mining pool that aggregates a lot of people's hash power.
*mining pools will have minimum withdraw amounts.  You may end up mining for weeks or longer depending on your hardware before you actually get coins sent to your wallet.  So pick a pool that has a good track record.
So research some coins....download a wallet and generate an address.  Pick your mining software and gain some EXP!

What he said.  Realize that while there are 21M total, only a fraction are on the market for trading at any time.  Go look at any order book on the trading sites.  
Lets say that any given time, the order book for an exchange has 2000BTC for sale, for prices from $10,000 through $999,999,999.  If someone puts a market order in for $200,000,000, they will blow through most of the order book creating a massive spike in prices.  Yes, artbitage models will step in at some point.....but across ALL exchanges there is a finite supply available for trading at any given time and that is only a fraction of the total supply.
The only way to game this is for an exchange to lie about what they actually have backing everything......you know...like Tether. /s

Have the same issue.  Very annoying.  Was able to create a coinbase account; no issues GD?X gave me the virtual finger.  Try another exchange which isn't as schizo about allowing you in.

It will be even better after the TA guys start trying to predict price movements.  I suspect we don't need TA to prognosticate this one.
To the core!!!

Set a limit order (good till cancel) for whatever price you want to buy in at...yes just like buying a stock.  Most exchanges support this.  You can also set wacky limits for things like flash crashes (buy 10000 ETH limit order @ $0.10 would have been handy a few months ago on one exchange).
That said, if you are asking these questions you need to educate yourself. Like NOW.

Its about increasing the block size (hence '2x').  Segwit has already happened.  Segwit pretty much eliminated the need for bigger blocks....hence the contention.

This is a battle for the most popular crypto coin.  Ultimately $Billions are at stake here.  This is likely a drop in the bucket.

Inflation is a stealth tax instituted by the FED to screw everyone who isn't a banker.  Let's be honest with our selves here.... The dollar is not your friend.  The stock market in Venezuela is up like crazy this year - think you should invest?  Taking measures to try to circumvent getting screwed by the FED is not progress; it's simply coping with a colossal mistake made in 1913.

Kraken was the first to verify me....so I'm using that for now.  I'd prolly use GDAX if I could get past the 1st step verification issues.

Bitcoin has yet to deal with a widespread economic downturn.  If the stock market turns south and people need to liquidate to cover being on the wrong side of a trade...or the next rent payment, sentiment could change quickly.
And remember there are no 'circuit breakers' here.  True price discovery works both ways.

You said 'state' and 'not meddle' in the same sentence without a /sarc tag at the end.  People will think you are serious.
States meddle.  It's what they do.
@_date: 2018-07-09 23:45:35
Lol...You said central bank and transparency in the same sentence.

He's a bit too eco-friendly for that.  Perhaps using the ASICS as water heaters instead of generic resistive elements?  I've always thought antminers would be a good way to heat water for a house.

1) Invest some time in Python.
2) This may help: 
Good luck!

Thx.  If only GDAX would get over the 'you don't exist and we won't help you' issues, I'd use them.

It's an AML thing.  That's the cost of being able to link to a bank account or wire money around.  You could always use localbitcoins and skip all the privacy invasion stuff.

This is the same Ameritrade that refused my request to wire money to Kraken in November?  Why yes it is.  How is the hipocracy coming, Ameritrade?

Good on you for getting people involved.
