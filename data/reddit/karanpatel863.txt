You really think govt will stop running if every crypto hodler dont declare their holdings? I for one do not think so
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:03:01
Depends on which cryptocurrencies one holds. I mean, I would happily pay taxes for auditable cryptos like Bitcoin,Ethereum, litecoin etc. It doesn't have to be the same for privacy focussed cryptocurrencies bcoz you cant pay taxes if you cant audit them unless you wanna go forward declaring your holdings by yourself.

Why trade on exchange when you can swap on DeX?
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:13:54
Will keep in mind next time. Thanks
@_date: 2018-09-15 13:57:39
Gee. Thanks for reminding me.

1. Lol, you are saying that bitcoin never dipped &amp; only the altcoins dipped? This do confirms that you are the bitcoin baghodler that i mentioned who are in "DENIAL".
2. PEOPLE LOVE TO CALL IT MANIPULATION BCOZ IT IS MANIPULATION. how cute of you defending bitcoin. Whole crypto industry knows how it is being manipulated. It has been proven many times. So no point arguing with you at this point.
3. Abt the Scaling with "LIGHTNING", it will make difference to Normal Individual until better GUI has been created. Dont forget it can't transact vast amount of  bitcoins offchain due to its capacity which is a must for institutions. Also the hassle of creating channels and its validity. Transacting Onchain is not an option for institutions as it takes ages for confirmations. 
4. I do agree on the liquidity point of yours, i would also like to pay my respect to BTC bcoz if wasn't for btc &amp; its scaling,privacy issues..alts would'nt be created at first place. These are the facts that can't be ignored. 
5. Also agree with you on this point PARTLY. i would like to modify the statement "Alts come &amp; go except for alts with usecases and which are mass adopted but BTC reigns." 
6. Revealing personal holdings in public isn't the wise thing to do. So i would'nt.
7. Carlos Matos is totally irrelevant to the topic. But yeah,   whatever.

Lol, crypto tribalism at its best ��
So well, the so called "tokens" you mentioned have actually have more usecases than your average "bitcoin" or "bitcoin-cash".
Does your shitcoin even SCALE without second layer scaling solution "lightning"? NO !  Bitcoiners should thank Elizabeth stark for saving bitcoin baghodlers. 
Alts will invade the whole crypto-market just like December 2k17 &amp; eat that MOST Manipulated Coin's market cap like anything. Bitcoin baghodlers are in denial, you guys cant accept the fact that there are way better cryptocurrencies which has better algorithm, secure &amp; private. Most importantly they SCALES unlike bitcoin's 7-10 TPS  !! See you @ next bull run. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 06:45:46
Lol, the altcoins have way more usecase than your bitcoin. As long as i know, things with usecases never disapperared.
@_date: 2018-09-15 13:56:28
��True. But unfortunately you will get downvoted by BTC maximalists and baghodlers. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:09:04
Congrats on your first BTC :]
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:47:08
None of above due to their TX fees ( Atleast for now ),
Bitcoin Maximalists Especially, dont even bother replying. LN does cost money to open channels. It could be small cost for you guys but not for Venezuelans.
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:04:26
Agreed i have been looking at similar chart since afternoon.  Also Fuck Peter Schiff, TradingRoomapp and all other TA Gurus who claim Bitcoin going to 4K !  No Fucks Given !
@_date: 2018-08-19 06:48:24
I feel sorry for you now ��
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:13:04
Perhaps he is posting this on purpose out of frustration ��
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:54:59
As much as we would love this, but everytime it surges the so called Manipulation kicks in. IMO Launch of Bitcoin Futures was worst move for us.
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:04:05
Is it dex?
@_date: 2018-08-20 03:15:47
first Bitcoin Maximalists wanted Futures, they got it eventually which turned out to be bad for Cryptomarkets.
Now, Bitcoin Maximalists want ETFs. IMO this is gonna be Worse.
Bitcoin was invented to be used as Currency, not as ETF and Futures trading. This thing defeats the entire purpose of Bitcoin.

Villify people who disgree with me? I will for sure villify people who spread Fake news so they can manipulate market through their huge follower base. You think Manipulation for self interest is good? Lol
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:25:20
Lol fck media bro, Mainstream media get paid by banks and other organisations to create FUD.
They decide project by PRICE.

@_date: 2018-05-28 17:22:21
Lol. WTF is that 
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:06:53
1. Thats your opinion and i have mine which says NO FUCKS GIVEN.. you can keep believing whatever you are fed into. Keep worshipping him. Its just not my STYLE.
2. I dont OWN shitty things or FOLLOW shitty persons.
3. Also DONT tell me what should i check and what should i not. 
4. You think that man with huge fan following base cant manipulate markets?  Perhaps its YOU, who need to learn abt crypto-manipulation. Not my problem if you cant accept facts. 
Lol. Crypto Tribalism at its best !
@_date: 2018-05-26 08:27:20
He must be time-traveller ��
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:06:19
Indeed. But its might take a while. Also heard US launched Criminal probe in BTC and ETH price Manipulation.
