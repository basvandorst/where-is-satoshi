It's funny he says so that it can be used for "heating houses." That's exactly what my miner does. Not to mention most mining uses clean energy because it's cheaper. These PC gamers bitch and whine that their cards are more expensive even though if they mined they could easily offset the extra cost and make a profit. GPUs are actually the cheapest they have ever been when you consider mining revenue. I bought my 1080 ti for $860 and I've made $250 with it making it $610. It's getting cheaper every day.
If these PC gamers wanted to lower GPU prices they should all start mining to increase difficulty. They somehow think that using their card to mine is going to make them part of the GPU price problem.

The Fed could decide to stop debasing the currency at any time. They have done it several times in the past. (See 2008, 2001, 1990, etc.)   The dollar will actually deflate during a credit squeeze so in this short term scenario Bitcoin doesn't win. Generally they don't stop debasing the currency for long. They tend to start inflating at unprecedented levels as soon as the markets tank as a knee jerk reaction. 
In the long term bitcoin will win as the government is incapable of balancing it's budget. It will always rely on inflation to manage it's debt.

At a high level there is a limited supply of bitcoin and there will only ever be 21 million. Bitcoin does not have to be purchased whole. Bitcoin is controlled by digital keys. These keys exist in pairs. One key receives bitcoin the other sends bitcoin. Together these keys are known as a wallet. To get bitcoin you have to buy some from an exchange. Some exchanges will create a wallet for you to hold your purchases. Generally it is not recommended to hold large amounts of bitcoin in an exchange wallet because there have been having incidents in the past and people have lost their money. Long term you should consider something called a hardware wallet. If you want to get into the details about how bitcoin is created and how it is transacted I'd suggest watching a YouTube video about the subject.

Miners will hash the block of transactions in combination with a random number between 0 and 4294967296. They don't need to try and coordinate this number since the set of transactions they are all hashing will be different since the first transaction in the block is the miner reward paying their own address. In addition to this number and the miner reward there is also a timestamp which is constantly incrementing.

Many people here talking about "What if the exchange gets hacked" 
People should be asking "Are the coins I bought even there?". An exchange could sell 1000 BTC and only have 100 BTC in reserves. They can get away with this as long as people don't try to withdrawal their money. The only way to protect yourself from a bank run is to hold the keys yourself.

Sitting on the BTC will never pay as much as loaning the BTC. You think the super rich are the only people who make investments? I guess in the fractional reserve banking system anyone with a positive net worth is considered "super rich". Quantitative easing causes artificially overvalued assets (aka a bubble) which will inevitably correct when quantitative easing ends. The losers are the investors holding the stock when the day of reckoning comes. 
The boom bust cycle caused by the federal reserve fucking with interest rates is slowing advancements because people are incentivized to make dangerous investments. Then when interest rates spike back up good investments can't get any investors.

When all bitcoin is mined the energy used for mining will be determined solely by demand for block space. You can't necessarily see this as energy wasted in all cases. I mine and the energy used is heating my house in the winter so that energy would've been spent regardless. [Some of large scale bitcoin mining are doing the same with their excess heat.]( Miners can also be utilizing energy that would've otherwise just been wasted. For example hydroelectric energy is use it or lose it. If the energy is not used it is lost in the spillway. Hydroelectric is a very popular energy source for large scale miners.
You also need to think about energy saved from efficiencies created by Bitcoin. Think of a world where Bitcoin replaces fiat and precious metals. There wouldn't be energy wasted on mining, refining, printing dollars, shipping dollars across the country, building ATMs, stocking ATMs, merchants taking dollars to the bank, building bank buildings and infrastructure, etc
If Bitcoin were to only ever to act as a store of value and replace precious metals and not a currency it would still save us energy. Bitcoin is helping the environment because people who would have invested in precious metals are now investing in Bitcoin. The FUD around mining energy costs is way overblown. There are ways which we waste energy which are way more important to focus on than Bitcoin mining. More energy is spent heating homes because of poor insulation than is spent on Bitcoin mining by a long shot. More energy is wasted by people driving big trucks and SUVs to work and not carpooling or taking public transit. More energy is wasted by people not recycling. All these people that are freaking out about energy spent mining bitcoin probably aren't doing these things. People should focus on where energy is REALLY being wasted.

The amount of energy spent mining Bitcoin is linked to the price of Bitcoin and demand for block space. The higher the rewards the more energy spent mining the block. The energy spent mining Bitcoin directly contributes to it's security. The more energy spent mining the more expensive it is for someone to control 50% of the mining. Lightning network will lower demand for block space. It will decouple energy spent from transactions processed. So now instead of transactions per block/energy spent per block it will be LN channel opens and closes per block/energy spent per block.

Because I could make more than 2-4% buying power if I risked the loss of principle. I always get the buying power from deflation in addition to the interest. Why wouldn't I make my bitcoin work for me?


Not everything you buy with a loan is worth less over time. For example houses, business ventures, etc. People shouldn't be buying things that depreciate over time with loaned money anyways. If they do then they should be willing to pay for the time value of that money to get whatever depreciative asset they wanted.


How could I predict what the rate of inflation will be? I will always get more back? what about the risk of loss of principle you just mentioned? 


I'd be happy to have my mortgage in bitcoin. The appreciation of a wise investment will far outpace the deflation of the currency.


There is a cost to not loaning both. Interest is lost in both cases. 


The benefit of not earning interest? What kind of benefit is that?


Yes, interest on USD loans has to cover inflation and risk. Bitcoin loans only has to cover risk.

If you watch the presentation given on the lightning network at  the entire thing is very similar to network security protocol discussion. Lots of Alice wants to do X with Bob so Alice does Y.

The answer to this is very simple. A loan of the total supply just can't mature at the exact same time.
I lend 1 btc. You pay me .1 btc for the first payment. I buy something from you for .1 btc. You pay me 1 btc. Effectively you paid me 1.1 btc. You earned the interest by providing goods and services. No increase in supply necessary.
You could even just make it simpler. I loan you 1 btc. You pay me back 1 btc and goods/services I deem worth .1 btc. You could say "But you could just say that nothing is worth .1 btc and they would be forever indebted." In reality nobody has a monopoly on the currency. You just have earn .1 btc from ANYONE who holds the currency. Why would you take a loan in a currency where someone holds 100% of the currency?

The price of goods and services will not only go down because currency doesn't inflate. Your entire argument uses this premise. Just because the value of the currency rises doesn't mean the value of the property decreases. It is still the same value even if it is worth marginally less btc because btc increased in value. Houses appreciate in value as demand for housing increase. It doesn't matter what currency you use to buy it with.
You're claim that people won't lend money because it will deflate is completely false. Holding a currency will never generate as much value as loaning the currency. I loan 1 btc and get back 1.1 btc. If I held the currency I'd still have 1 btc. 
Inflation doesn't make debt less risky for the lender. I loan money and when I am repaid the principal plus interest could be worth less than the principal. How is that less risky?  
Your quoted rates of interest are way off. Bitcoin interest rates will be lower than USD interest rates because the interest rate doesn't need to cover inflation.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:45:02
If it doesn't implement the cap on supply then it isn't Bitcoin. It doesn't matter if there is some chain in bitcoin that gets more hash power. If it tries to sign blocks that add more bitcoins than 21 million then those aren't valid blocks. That would just be an alt coin.
Hashing power has nothing to do with it. You're just saying "What if everyone just stopped using bitcoin and used another coin?" that doesn't make Bitcoin inflationary and isn't even an attack.
Edit: Why does everyone think that hashing power can make people accept invalid blocks? If you control 50% hashing power you can only control the content of the blocks, not their validity. If someone acquired 50% SHA-256 hashing power then Bitcoin is worthless because that person could double spend and prevent you from spending or receiving. It doesn't allow you to change the block difficulty or make more than 21 million bitcoins.

Incentivizing debt by artificially lowering interest rates by printing money is what has caused middle class Americans to not have financial stability by punishing them for saving for retirement. It artificially inflates prices of real estate and property so people can no longer afford a home. Look at the price of tuition and government subsidized student loans. Look at the current housing market because of quantitative easing. 
edit: downvote all you want you Keynesian idiots. [Explain this with your economic theories]( Price is a function of supply and demand. If you increase the demand by making debt too easy to obtain and the natural result is the artificial increase in the price of the asset. Just look at the 2008 housing bubble. Or have you forgotten already? The Bitcoin genesis block read "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". You Keynesian idiots have lost. You can't make me hold your inflationary fiat anymore.

The only thing that will stop the bubbles and recessions is if we force banks to have cash for every loan they make. As long as there are loans which are promised a bailout then this law changes nothing.
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:34:25
If every dollar represents a loan and loans are charged compounding interest there must be a compounding growth in dollars (inflation) to avoid default or all the interest earned must be spent. Once people start saving their earned interest/new loans stop growing at exponential rates there is an inevitable collapse. The Fed will inevitably cause a collapse because they try to keep inflation low by preventing new loans from being made by increasing interest rates.
So I disagree that a debt based currency is not an necessarily a bad thing because it leads to a bubble recession cycle which is impossible to avoid because the Fed doesn't know how to set interest rates and constantly leaves them too low causing bubbles/inflation and then raises them to kill the resulting bubbles/inflation.

The town is basically banning the power company's customers so they have exclusive access to the cheap power. This should be completely illegal and I suspect it already is.

Also "not creating jobs" is complete bullshit. Like these people don't buy anything at all from the town. They don't eat out, buy houses, create utility jobs, hire security, maintenance workers, etc.

This is a great law which will help prevent bubbles and recession by forcing people to actually determine a banks risk before lending to them.

Ok, so I send someone 1btc with 1 sat/byte fee. Everyone sees this transaction and generates a block with it included and continues to build a chain on top of this block. I make a second transaction with 2 sat/byte fee and generate a chain from this block instead. I broadcast this chain invalidating the old chain because according to your consensus mechanism it is now the valid chain. 
I don't even have to increase the fee. I could just generate addresses until the transaction hash is higher than the original transaction hash. Which on average has a 50% chance per address I generate.
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:59:01
If someone had the ability to out hash the rest of the network they could do this attack. 
That would require a 50%+ control of all hashing power which is prohibitively expensive. In your proposed consensus mechanism such an attack requires no expense.

I'm not saying the loan goes up. I've never stated that. I said homes are more expensive because of quantitative easing so even though inflation makes debt easier to pay off you still end up paying more.

If the majority supported a hard fork then why is it a fraction of the market cap? If you knew anything about computer science you would know you can't solve a scaling problem by taking an algorithm from O(n) runtime to O(.5n) runtime. They both still scale at the same rate. Lighting is going from O(n) to O(1). And your excuse is you're too lazy to learn about the protocol that makes infinite transaction scaling possible. Your shit coin only buys you one doubling before you need to do it again at the cost of fracturing the entire market. Get a fucking clue.

Lightning isn't a hard fork like bitcoin cash. It is still the same coin. You don't even know enough to know that.
