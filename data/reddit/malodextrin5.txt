So once you cash out and pay the capital gains tax, do you have to pay an additional income tax at the end of the year on the money coming in?

Dealing with the IRS isn't fun. I'm not planning to make bank, but you never know what happens so it's good to know the applicable laws. I wonder where most crypto users on reddit stand on reporting their income for tax purposes?

From the perspective of someone who may not know the issues involved with the debit cards, what's the problem with know-your-customer? Every bank requires that information. I understand if the user is involved with illicit activity why they wouldn't want kyc, but what about for the average user?

But bitcoin is not an officially recognized currency, it's an asset. If I never trade out of bitcoin into cash when involved in trades, then is the trade itself taxable? So if i go from litecoin to bitcoin, I'm taxed? I thought gains weren't realized until they're converted into cash.

There are externalities to drug use that we as a society have to deal with. Addicts are more likely to use up medical services, be homeless, and be engaged in crime. Drug addicts are incredibly expensive. As long as socialism exists (whether in the form of emergency rooms, medicaid, or government run shelters) people should not be incentivized to use drugs. They are a drain on productive society.

So basically, if you don't have a job and you just sit around day-trading, then you have an effective income tax of 15% or 20% at the end of the year. I know this may be out of your depth, but I imagine you still have to pay FICA taxes on that correct? Thank you for the in depth explanation, it's very much appreciated.

I don't think it would be a taxable event because then that would mean you'd have to pay taxes on gains or losses that aren't realized. The loss/gain between the two currencies is only a theoretical one, not a realized one. If I had to pay taxes when I traded litecoin for bitcoin when it was $500, does that mean I wouldn't have to pay taxes now that I sell out at $3,000? The tax was paid, if I'm forced to pay again then I'm being taxed twice on the same transaction. 
I'm mostly just think aloud. I'll def ask around, because this is an issue. Thanks for the response.
