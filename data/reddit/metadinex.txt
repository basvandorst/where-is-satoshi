The Euro immediately becomes the main currency in every country that adopts it because of the way these things work. People get paid in Euro. They pay taxes in Euro etc. It's not comparable with how bitcoins spread.

His arguments for why hyperinflation is coming are not logical. He just doesn't understand basic economics at all, and that's why he's almost always wrong in his predictions and also why he's doing horribly when he's trading on his own predictions.
@_date: 2014-03-21 11:30:05
It's pretty insane that you think this comparison makes sense.

Seems like a pretty easy choice. Wendy Davis is clearly the better option of those two.

Maybe it was easier?

No, it's not a meaningless phrase. It only becomes meaningless when people try to bend what it means by claiming bitcoins have intrinsic value.
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:45:40
That's exactly my point. It's a huge waste of resources.

Austrian economics:
Most research regarding the theory finds that it is inconsistent with empirical evidence. Economists such as Gordon Tullock,[48] Bryan Caplan,[49] Milton Friedman,[50][51] and Paul Krugman[52] 
In 1969, Milton Friedman argued that the theory is not consistent with empirical evidence[54] and using newer data in 1993 reached the same conclusion

This would make sense if bitcoin had any chance of replacing existing infrastructure.

I'm simply talking about what has happened in the past and why inflation is a feature in modern currencies. As for who gains most from the current system I believe that has much more to do with neoliberalism and the labor vs capital battle than monetary policy. I don't see how poor people would be better off with deflation.

But it has no intrinsic value.
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:22:22
You shouldn't trust anything you read from the bitcoin fanatics on this subreddit. Inflation is a feature because deflation has been disastrous for economies when it has happened. Look at the great depression or Japan the last couple of decades.

Krugman claims in that article that war is not good for the economy. houseofchill appears to either not have read or not understood it.

You must be on crack if you think accepting bitcoins is something that will be a real deciding factor for more than 2 people on the planet in what car they're going to buy. Some of you bitcoin fanatics have no sense of reality.
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:23:24
Nope. I have never said any of the things you suggest. All I have said is that deflation has never been indicative of great economic periods for countries, and that's why central banks try to avoid deflation. This is simply a fact. Once a crisis hits the central bank attempts to get out of the following deflationary spiral as that always makes things worse. Imagine how unstable shit would be if the main currency people used was itself designed to be deflationary. Learn to read.
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:45:49
You should read the article. houseofchill is saying the opposite of what the article claims. Krugman is saying war is in fact not good for the economy.

I made my point. You have to be pretty dumb not to get what my short and concise point was.

So you did get my point. What the fuck are you bitching on about then.

Poor people don't have savings. They have debt. Deflation is disastrous for them.

He isn't really arguing that war is good for the economy in any of the links you just posted. You should consider reading them.
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:09:08
To give a short explanation. The reason why inflation is wanted in a currency is because you want high velocity. If your money is gaining value by holding it, then people are less likely to spend it and you get lower velocity and less economic activity. In the great depression there was deflation, meaning people holding money gained purchasing power simply by holding it. According to the logic of some of the bitcoin fanatics that should have been good for the economy because people were technically richer as a result, but that is of course not what happened. It was a disaster for the economy. There are many other examples of deflation throughout history and it's never been good for economic activity.
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:59:28
Your question makes no sense. I haven't said spending money on useless consumption is desirable.

I don't really get why monetary inflation is supposed to be more interesting to us than actual price inflation. I don't get what kind of point you're trying to make and how it relates to anything I said.

That is if they use the BitPay service. I was making arguments against them taking bitcoins in general. The problems with Butterfly Labs go beyond the late deliveries. Calling the company a scam is barely hyperbole. That doesn't mean there aren't a couple of people that got their product and aren't completely pissed off at them.
You have to agree that it's extremely unlikely that their sales would go up by accepting bitcoins. There just aren't a meaningful amount of people in the world making car purchases based on who accepts bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:28:03
No. I don't need be in charge of every central bank to know the rationale for why they do the things they do.

People also have to remember that Tesla is publicly traded. Even if Musk wanted this to happen, it would be really hard to justify this extra unnecessary risk to the shareholders.

It doesn't make much sense for a car company to accept bitcoins. It won't happen.

He predicted that inflation would continue to be low as long as the economy is depressed. And he was right. Inflation has been low.

It just has never worked out great for economies when they've hit deflation. I don't get how you can be so blind to this fact.

He actually is pretty good at predictions. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:56:24
If that was how it worked out then it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. But that isn't how it has worked out. Deflation didn't help in the great depression.

There's really nothing to gain for Tesla in doing this. That's the most obvious reason.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:31:54
It could be crazy easy and it still doesn't make any sense for Tesla to do this. They won't sell any more cars by doing it. It's extra work for them. The crazy price fluctuations in bitcoins is a risk element they don't need to take on for no gain. They sell most of their cars in several payments over a time period, and this would be really risky to do with something that fluctuates as much as bitcoin. There are a lot of reasons why they shouldn't do this, and really no reasons why they should. Also Tesla is a legit company that is publicly traded while Butterfly Labs is basically a scam. Sorry for spreading some reality in the bitcoin subreddit.

You don't know your history. Or you simply don't know what inflation is.

What is this "monetary inflation" and how does it differ from actual inflation, which is the price increase in goods and services?

You would prefer. But it would not be a deciding factor. And you are far from the norm.

@_date: 2013-12-25 23:06:30
I'm going to address the one horrible point you made earlier and then I won't bother with you anymore. You said:
"By any metric of growth or success, Bitcoin is doing phenomenal. So far, spending within the Bitcoin economy/ecosystem has been increasing drastically over time, so your argument that "deflation kills economies" is being empirically discredited before your very eyes. "
This is wrong for many reasons. I will only address the most basic reasons. You're comparing apples to oranges. There is no country using bitcoin as their main currency. And my examples of economies clearly referred to countries or currency unions. Saying that bitcoin disproves any of the things I said is like saying paypal disproves it because paypal is a success and has expanded every year. Or saying that gold disproves it, or maybe even more accurately it's like saying a stock that has gone up in price and volume disproves it. The point is the comparison doesn't make sense and you clearly don't understand my argument or basic economics at all.
In fact when bitcoin increases in price what is happening the money supply is being expanded. New USD or CNY or whatever are being created out of nothing. This means that bitcoin going up in price means more monetary inflation. Bitcoin is inflationary in the context of a national economy.
The fact that you thought this was a good argument tells me it's beyond my abilities to educate you on this subject. You have strong opinions but you don't know anything. For some insight into your own situation look up the Dunning–Kruger effect.
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:58:01
That doesn't make any sense. You're not good at communicating.

Saying that stimulus is good in times of labor surplus is not the same as the broken window fallacy.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:08:07
Milton Friedman agreed with you that the Federal reserve was to blame for the depression. He believed they didn't do enough to expand the money supply.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:40:23
Everything is a conspiracy to bitcoin fanatics.
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:18:45
Exactly. He says the stimulus helps. The war is not the reason. There is a big difference there in what he's arguing and what you claim he's arguing.
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:41:09
Hoarding is actually bad if you want bitcoin to succeed as a currency. Now if you want it to be like a commodity like gold then you could argue it doesn't matter.
