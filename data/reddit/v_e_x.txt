It seems to be a recurring issue.... whoops....

I watch both, but if I had to make a choice I'd watch anything on Netflix, rather than youtubers and streamers. Half of them have over-inflated teenage egos that make me pray for mushroom clouds.

How dare this anonymous exchange transact in anonymous currency without telling me who they are!  Don't they know who I am!... Errrhhh....
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:12:51
Awesome. This needed to happen.
@_date: 2014-11-27 03:40:43
Oh my god! That must mean that all of these community currencies are and have always been illegal!
Why has no other news source EVER exposed such un-american devilry!
Constimatution to the rescue!

I have never had an issue with btc-e. It's cryptsy that sometime gives me hell at first, but even there, things have somewhat smoothed out.

There's also a ton of info on programming bitcoin/crypto-currencies here: @_date: 2014-07-03 22:02:47
Awesome. I've loved them for years. Have always wanted to give them money, but never got around to it. Feels to good to philanthrophize with bitcoin!

Cool. But not sure if you're aware that there's a more general subreddit for crypto currency programming:
@_date: 2014-08-12 21:54:34
Yes, it is known!

Btc-e is like an old drug dealer my friends and I had in high school. He didn't go to school with us. We didn't know his last name. He never stayed in one place too long. He never smiled or joked. He never smoked with you or stayed long enough to socialize. He always pulled up in nondescript car and always had a hot chic waiting for him in it. But he was never late. He never bragged or bullshitted you. His shit was always measured to the tee. He never ripped anyone off. And he always had some when no one else did.

I live in Texas. Trust me. There are plenty of people scared of the word 'evolution' as well... =/
