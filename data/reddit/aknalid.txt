This is the proper way to handle data breaches. Take note.

Anyone know where I could find the original clip of this scene?

You just need to [follow this guy's advice]( ;)

Unfortunately, a lot of states REQUIRE that you not only publicly disclose your name, but even appear in media promotions.

If anyone has earned the right to indulge in hookers and blow, it's Bitcoin.

The original quote is by *Felix Dennis*, and it says:


..and yes, this is due to massive depreciation from airplanes, boats, and wives.

That's a logical conclusion. TIL vegans are angry by default.

Yeah. What the fuck? The Dark Net is a great example of a *true free market* in the absence of government intervention.
How can that be bad publicity? Bitcoin is a TOOL -- just like a hammer. 
How people use tools should not be held against the tool(s).
Not to mention, Rogan's podcast is 10% about drugs anyway, so this topic is inevitable.

It's the *closest* thing to a free market. I haven't dealt with the Dark Nets in a long time, but during the whole Silk Road saga -- it had some of the highest quality product in the world due to it's Amazon-like reviews from buyers.
Since drugs won't be 100% legal and you won't be able to pick them up from the corner store, the best bet (in my opinion) would be to rely on the Dark Nets. I can't think of an alternative.
