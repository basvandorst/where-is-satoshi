He was pretty fucking far from a gentleman too.

Just flip the headline around a little. Bitcoin is 500 times rarer than gold! 
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:19:10
Huh? Doesn't this number equal the current price of bitcoin times the number of coins in existence (lost or not)? 
@_date: 2016-12-11 16:00:23
Or, more likely, he has people helping him with his investments and press releases. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:29:09
I'm friends with him. He's a billionaire in Danish currency not US dollars or Euros (as for now).

I already voted for Gary Johnson - Trump is a fucking asshole - but commenting because if he wins I'll need money to get right the fuck out of here.

Fuck that I want PIZZA.

Yes. I know. Obviously. But coinbase does insure its holdings in case of theft. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:58:27


Aren't they insured though?

Maybe it's because the US is the only country in the world that taxes you on your worldwide income. If you live abroad it's some real bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:59:19
The market will set the rates! The rates will be as fair as humanely possible because there will be unlimited competition. Even you, yes YOU can start a bank if you think the rates are whack.

so it doesn't mean hold on for dear life? 
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:35:10
Because money is involved. People are financially invested.

Listen MaunaLoona I don't know what ANYTHING means.  I'm damn near retarded.  You - you're fucking special.  I've read this entire thread (very difficult because of my low IQ) and I see you've told many commenters that they don't know the definition of words.  It's a fucking  epidemic.  So relax.  I won't be "coming back" to you - how can one 'come back' when they don't ever leave in the first place?  
I'm going to stick to you like glue baby.  Cause you know all and I'm fucking retarded.  I'm going to listen to everything you say on reddit from here on out.  And you should continue to listen to absolutely nothing that others are saying (because you know all).  
So I mean it...no more of this "come back when" business ok?  I'm here to stay.  You're fucking amazing.  Go look at yourself in the mirror for a few hours and orgasim at your greatness.  I'm sorry to be so wordy (especially since I often don't know the meaning of words) but you are fucking AWESOME!

So you're suggesting bitcoins can match the value of the second most profitable company in the world?  
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:55:14
The time spent mining it has value 
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:05:59
Thank you for the information.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:05:54


Exactly my point.  Time is valuable to all of us. People wouldn't spend their time mining gold if it were a waste of time.   
I should also point out that gold is used in computers, electronics, medicine, etc.  
The value of gold in society can increase or decrease over time, but it certainly has some intrinsic value to it.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:55:29
Could you please tell me how you define intrinsic value?  Perhaps we define it differently.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:25:57
Ok genius.  I don't know what words n' stuff mean.  You're right - I'm wrong.  Fiat is equal in every way to commodities.  US dollars are just as valuable as gold because Ben tells me so.  Zeros and ones on a screen are equal to something that is rare and useful in industry and has to be fucking mined. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:08:43
The only thing that is subjective about gold is HOW valuable it is.  I don't think anybody could argue it is without value.    
Can the same be said of Zimbabwe dollars?   
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:02:19


Two questions.  Did the creator of bitcoin just bang his number pad for 30 seconds to get a random, really long number?  
Did you just bang your number pad for 30 seconds to get a random, really long number for this post?  
I was told no question is too stupid!  
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:34:26
No you didn't.

@_date: 2013-04-12 17:32:37
No no - I get it.  I'm saying you're right and I'm wrong.  We AGREE now.  You don't have to use any more internet cliches like "strawman".  I'm on your side!   
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:42:51
Gold is a naturally occurring element on our planet that has value to society beyond its beauty and usefulness as jewelry and money.  
The fact that it is relatively rare and takes a considerable amount of labor to mine has traditionally made it very valuable. I will say it again, the value of it could increase or decrease.  The fact remains it will maintain some degree of value forever.  
You seem to think that gold only has value because at some point we decided it was valuable.  That is not so.  Its usefulness in industry means it is at the very least somewhat valuable.  The same could be said of any metal or grain or fuel.  I don't believe the same can be said of zeros and ones, or government promises.

Thank you.  That's interesting.
