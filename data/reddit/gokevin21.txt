If the value rises enough to tempt me to spend a little I am most likely to simply transfer some of my holdings to my bank account from my Coinbase account at the current USD exchange rate.  Current US law treats Bitcoin like an asset so it is far easier from an accounting point of view for me to record the gain/loss when I make the transfer to a dollar denominated account rather than when I buy something directly with Bitcoin, thus having to track the fiat value of each purchase separately to account for the correct gain/loss per transaction.

I would advise anyone with substantial deposits in Greece to immediately open an account in a german bank and transfer their savings there.  This is in fact what most large depositors in Greece have already done.  Its really a no-brainer decision because you're transferring at minimal cost from one euro denominated account into another euro account.  What you want to avoid at all costs is being stuck with a bunch of depreciating Drachmas.

I just installed a full XT node on my server as my personal vote of confidence.  It's very easy to do.  It runs as a patch to the bitcoin core client and you may easily switch back and forth as you wish.  Download the latest XT release here

An old law school professor once helped me with the difference and I never forgot it.  He said "the pressure on a seal has on affect on the effect of the seal"

I'm transacting on Coinbase right now.  There seems to be no hit to performance on their site at all.

All the angst here about the injustices inflicted on Ross Ulbricht seem misplaced to say the least.  The guy tried to and may very well have been successful in having people murdered in order to make life easier for Ross Ulbricht.  A man like this should not be freely walking the streets.  He is a menace who should be kept safely away from civilized society.

The price began to fall minutes after his Essay and the NYT article was referenced on Reddit.  Its pretty clear this was the cause.

As I understand it this is a peer-to-peer zero-fee system.  Presumably there will be terms-of-use to enforce or this just becomes a method to circumvent local laws and regulations.  How will a VC who has already invested $1 million conceivably recoup their investment, and How will administrators be compensated for enforcing terms-of-use?

I've used my BofA account to buy hundreds of Bitcoins over the past year on Coinbase and have never heard a peep from BofA.

They want to develop a closed system that processes transactions via a cooperative model with evidently no monetary incentive for mining transactions. If the bitcoin network can prove itself to be robust and scalable I believe that the big players will eventually migrate their efforts to the bitcoin blockchain.  CTO's at large companies are loath to commit critical data to a software platform that in their minds is handicapped by a chaotic development process.  This mindset will change slowly, because nothing gets a CTO fired faster than a botched system's upgrade.

My experience with Coinbase over the last 12 months is very good.  They are extremely responsive to customer inquiries, and their interface is clean and intuitive.  I have linked my Coinbase and Bank of America accounts, and have never had an issue with either entity when transferring funds in either direction.  Granted I only use Coinbase as a sort of Bitcoin Bank and rarely use Bitcoin to buy anything.

This tax treatment makes spending Bitcoin to buy things an enormous pain at tax time.  I personally will not view it as anything but an investment to be saved and rarely sold until this changes.

None of the fund's participants are selling and probably won't until the price is significantly higher than it is right now.

I do apologise for the question, but how can I tip you without a public address from you?  Sorry again, I'm a newbie here.

LOL, yes it would be a bad thing to happen from my point of view as well, but it makes for an interesting thought experiment.  I do appreciate your help today!

Coinbase has been exceptionally professional and responsive to all my support requests, which really have only amounted to questions.  I have never had a problem with deposits, redemptions, or any other aspect of their system.

Yes there seems to be an infinitesimal possibility of two or more persons creating an identical public and corresponding private key.

Thank you!  This is very interesting to me.  So there is an infinitesimal possibility of two or more persons creating an identical public and corresponding private key.

Yes, I entered it in the search box.

FYI, it was the NYSE that invested in Coinbase

I suppose someone could create a massive address generator and check the addresses against the the blockchain.  I wonder how the difficulty would compare to decrypting a mining hash.
