i think so too. they are bashing the euro because the European Central Banking is pumping tons of new money into the market but the ECB is doing that SINCE the euro crisis. American FED is doing that since ever I think.....
However, Bitcoin is the better money :P

lol I have more trust in Euro than in USD. The european central bank is pumping high amounts of new money into the market SINCE the crisis. FED is doing that 	ever since I can remember.
But seriously. I think NOW it is the time in which it decides if we humans can smooth the way to a real democracy or if it will be like thousands years before. I am living in Germany and the only party which I trust that it will change the damn system is the  . Of course I have the coice between many parties for that I can vote (I think that voting system is better than in America) but at the end I only can vote who lies on me. It is a fake democracy because people in big parties are lobby guys and if you want to join a party and are saying the truth you can do it only once. That is how it works. 
If we are not changing the system these days we will never have such a good chance in history again I think. They are not stupid. They recognized the danger of freedom and internet. That is the reason why they want to introduce new internet censor methods around the world. 
I hope the crisis increases so people will ask "is it really the right solution if we are fightings dubt with dubt"?
