Gotcha, so two weeks is the official time then? I’m not really in a rush I was just curious, I’m still pretty new to bitcoin.

They definitely get unstuck eventually, or you can use a child pays for parent transaction (I think) to speed it up.

Nobody knows how much it’ll be worth in a month. Just invest whatever you’re willing to lose and hopefully you’ll make a profit.

I don’t know why my wallet suggested such a low fee...never doing that again. Is there a chance it never gets unstuck?

Got it. Could I do a child pays for parent type of thing? Or I guess pay a transaction accelerator service if I had to

you have to refer to the original transaction in the new one, did you follow a guide

Clearly you’re too retarded to recognize a joke lol

Honestly I don’t know much about it (Google is your friend), but essentially from what I read you make another transaction with a higher fee to push the old one. There’s lots of guides on how to do it

I know! :) Really wish I got in on it sooner but never felt comfortable investing money I couldn’t afford to lose. Better late than never right?

I plan on investing more when I can. Serious question though: everyone here seems so confident that bitcoin is just going to keep rising. I’m aware it’s been doing great so far but is there any other reasons (aside from history) that everyone is so confident in it?

not yet, girlfriend had her car broken into so I was dealing with that. looks like it’s going back up now? I’ll probably wait a little and see what happens 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:09:03
I’m considering it. Should I?
