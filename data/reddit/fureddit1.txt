But that was the original spirit of Bitcoin where it was decentralized and the governments around the world weren't supposed to be able to get their money grubbing hands on a citizen's money because the govt didn't know who owned it.
There's a reason why the exchanges are requiring a way to ID a user and it's because the govt wants your money that you worked hard for.

Now you have something to give to the TSA when they ask you to hand over your Bitcoins.

Because the current method allows a trader to be identified but it's at the discretion if the government wants to prosecute a person or not.
The whole monetary policy is a joke and so is Bitcoin trying to go mainstream.  Going mainstream totally ruins what the spirit of Bitcoin was.

Call me a cunt then because I don't want to give anymore of my money to my govt which wants to start wars with other countries for no good reason.  
My country has been at war for the last 18 years and I'd rather see that tax payer money go to shit that's happening in America, not to kill innocent people.

You're a sucker!
@_date: 2018-05-22 05:01:00
And then the govt knows that you made these transactions and will penalize you with a tax.

Although bitcoin is created with computers and electricity, it only has value because people say it does and use it but that could stop at any time, just like the Bolivar.
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:07:44
Printing money is proof that it exists but it only has value because people believe it does.
Since people don't believe in the Bolivar, they're throwing real printed money away.

I think Beijing wants to know who has Bitcoins and what better way to find out than have people pay for subscriptions with Bitcoin where they'll find out your name and address.

I knew something funny was going on when they let Bitcoin be sold as a future which ruined the spirit of what Bitcoin is and that is trading money anonymously.

Let's see. 
Inflation causes the dollar bills that you have in your pocket and in the bank worth **less.**
And how is that a good thing?


I don't have an idealogical disagreement because inflation isn't idealogical, it's a reality that doesn't need to be this way.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:38:27
And it's taxed since the govt knows you own bitcoin, sucker.

Bitcoin wasn't meant to be a large-scale economic solution.  It was supposed to be an anonymous way of trading money for goods/services.


Yes it is.  Quantatative Easing was just a fancy term to say that the Fed printed more money.  Now, they don't even call it Quantatative Easing and the news now just reports that the Fed injects money into our monetary system:
**And this is bad because everytime the Fed prints money out of thin air, it effectively makes the dollar bills in our bank accounts worth less than before the Fed injected the money into the supply.**
SMH, you have no clue.

Yes it is.  All we need to do is to go back to the Gold Standard that Ron Paul was promoting.  Also, Mummar Khadafi was trying to push the Gold Dinar before he was assassinated.  
And who said we can't have a credit system with our money tied to gold.
Dude, you're idealogies are dumb.  Get with reality.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:59:04
It's not anonymous anymore due to people like you. 
Go ahead and let the govt tax your bitcoin because that's what they're going to do because they know you own some.
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:30:49
Ad hominem?  I bet you feel all smart using words like that.
Anyways, this conversation was never going to be productive because you feel we can't go back to a gold standard and you have some crazy notion that I feel Bitcoin can replace physical dollars which is totally nuts.  You can't get rid of physical dollars because you can't trade Bitcoin if the electricity is out.

"Crypto Dispensers Bitcoin ATMs Inside Woodfield Mall a Simon Mall"
What kind of grammar is this?
@_date: 2019-10-25 03:56:39
I never said you were but Bitcoin wasn't meant for people like you.
Bitcoin was supposed to be used as money, not an investment.
@_date: 2019-01-20 01:31:10
Bitcoin is superior in every way but you can't use it if there isn't any electricity.  
@_date: 2019-01-20 01:53:45
Cash is still king when there isn't electricity.
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:58:41
Stay anonymous and they can't tax you.
That is one of bitcoin's main goal.
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:30:29
Lol, you don't need a cash register to accept cash.

I'm curious, what are wrong with paper wallets because this is the route I was thinking of going.

The taxi driver should try Square.  
The fees are on a transaction basis only.
