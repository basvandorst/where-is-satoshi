The current situation reminds me as well of the dotcom bubble bursting. The internet received so much hype in the end of the 90s. It was this new shiny thing that would change the world - "everyone will do all their shopping on the world wide web!" "No one will write letters, they will use email instead!" "you can even get the internet on your phone thanks to WAP!"
As we now know, all these concepts became reality - but it took a long time for the infrastructure and public adoption to reach maturity. The early investors were premature, the technology - software and hardware - moved on immeasurably.
Crypto is the same I think. It will be important in the future - one day may even replace state-issued currency for many transactions. It will bring many changes and new paradigms that have not even been imagined yet.
Crypto of some form will succeed. However I see no reason for bitcoin to hold a special place, and holding bitcoin at the current prices is a very risky gamble in my view.

$910? Bargain! I bought 2 at $1030 last November! I also have a few more I bought before that at $400. I was just thinking the price was stabilising til today. Bitcoin keeps you guessing alright.

you don't 'own' your body though. that would be like saying an ant owns its body - no no, your body is the property of the *hive*. Now bend over this barrel, there's a nice gentleman from the government here to see you.

it seems bittrex disabled a bunch of accounts on the last day of July. Put in a support ticket and you'll get unsuspended - you will probably need to do 'Enhanced Verification' on your account if you haven't already.

Looks like a couple of days.
