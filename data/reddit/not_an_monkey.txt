is the plan still to enable withdrawals before allowing trading? That'd be a disasterous mistake as this would cause all funds to be deposited on other exchanges. Both should be enabled in tandem.

I think it's very, very important for Bitfinex significantly upgrade the security. Make it to be the most secure exchange out there so that customers will continue to use your platform.

Good point. I think some sort of (major) cold-storage would make most customers feel comfortable though.

How much did you deposit?
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:56:26
Only 2 hours?

Really hoping for some good news in the statement that'll be released later today. As a student with almost his entire net worth on Bitfinex (~ 75.000$ US) the outcome of how this will be handled really has significant impact on my life. Please strive for an ethically, morally justified resolution. Thanks.

"..WERE leaning towards.." -&gt; not anymore?

Would it be likely to be today though?

How does one get verified on Bitfinex?

I still believe Bitfinex will be up and running soon. 60M might seem llike alot, but it's barely a year of their revenue. It'd be dumb to give up now when there's so much potential. Cryptocurrency markets are growing, it'd be a mistake not to factor in the cost of missed opportunity regarding the survival of Bitfinex.

He probably has a USD balance and wishes to withdraw BTC. Are there any plans to enable trading (or convert USD balances into BTC per request) short term?
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:03:23
Unverified (US) customers can trade BFX?

You have been saying 'tomorrow' / 'today' for a VERY long time now. Give us a more accurate time of when we can expect a statement?

Thank you sir. I appreciate all the hard work, but I just wanted to make sure that Bitfinex is aware of the impact their decisions will have.
