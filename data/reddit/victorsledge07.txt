I will buy all you Bitcoins for 50% spot so you don't lose too much.

Miners get paid to mine blocks and also get paid transaction fees. For every new block created...roughly every 10 min 12.5 btc is rewarded. It in no way resembles diamond mining.

Mining power and hash rate will continue to become more centralized under the current infrastructure. How do people not see this as problematic? 
If you regular Joe cannot mine due to low profitability...is this not a problem?
As more centralization occurs does this not lend itself to the possibility the one entity could take control of 51%?
What would prevent the super wealthy from pooling together to take control of all the hashing power?

The price of Bitcoin dropped....sell sell sell

You are so fucked that you may want to never buy Bitcoin again...or get used to riding the rollercoaster to riches.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:10:40
You hit the nail on the head!

So true!

I do not mean to imply that your are stupid. As the poster below has pointed out I am the stupid one.
@_date: 2017-01-28 00:49:08
Making those coins the better option.
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:56:31
Agreed. Bitcoin has become everything that it was never designed to be.

Up vote x1000. Why people invest their entire life savings in Bitcoin is beyond what I can fathom.

Miners will still get transaction fees. But will it still be profitable to mine if you are getting transactions fees only? How high will transactions need to be in order for miners to make a profit? If transaction fees are high it may make Bitcoin worthless as a payment system.

May never get confirmed
@_date: 2017-01-17 00:48:20
My recommendation is to not mine Bitcoin unless you have free electricity. Otherwise the shop has sailed.
@_date: 2017-01-06 01:01:26
I'm guessing 1 BTC will hit $100,000 by this time tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:37:20
Unfortunately Bitcoin has become a Frankenstein like monster that in no way resembles its original intent.
@_date: 2017-01-28 01:09:01
I just dropped a deuce and it was damn good for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-01-17 23:32:41
This is why Bitcoin will never work as a payment system for the masses. To easy to loose your money.

Personal Bitcoin mining is dead. Which is sad because the hash rate has become so centralized.
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:05:23
Just got a keepkey today. Very easy to set up.

I agree. As vdoggydog ruff ruff pointed out...I am stupid.
@_date: 2017-01-15 18:40:53
I do. Diversification is key to a strong portfolio. To put your "fiat" into one investment vehicle is a lack of sound judgement. To invest anything you cannot afford to loose is lack of sound judgement.
@_date: 2017-01-18 01:14:19
I humbly submit myself to your infinite wisdom. You have shown me the error of my ways. My stupidity overwhelms me. If you would kind sir...please fix the posters wallet and current predicament.

It's not so much that "nothing" is getting done. It's more about all the infighting in the community that is causing problems to the detriment of the end user. The development seems rather shortsighted. Could no one see the issues down the line 2 years ago. If Bitcoin was betting on mass adoption the issues should have been resolved before they actually became real issues. Confirmation times are so slow and if you want quicker confirmation you have to pay an arm and leg. Soon it will become a competition of who is willing to pay the highest transaction fee...until users get sick of shelling out a lot of coin. Then users go away in favor of a "better" payment system. If something is not done soon Bitcoin will be nothing more than a store house of value. Not exactly what Satoshi envisioned.

Why is it that anyone who questions BTC is trolling?

We need more people to run full nodes. That number has been decreasing as far as I know.

I knew there was a lot of delays from the company. I didn't realize they never delivered the x3. I have a x 1.5 and although it is archaic by today's standard I like it. I mine as a hobby. Not for profit.

Codebase is not where you want to store your Bitcoin. Cold storage is best!

I would be happy to get to $1500.

I would suggest getting a ASIC.
