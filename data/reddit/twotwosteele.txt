Bitcoin rallies alongside stocks
Feb. 6, 2018 3:33 PM • SA Editor Stephen Alpher
Is Bitcoin just another risk asset now. Alongside a sizable bounce in stocks, the crypto has also pushed aside the panicky action of the past couple of sessions, currently higher by nearly 11% to $7,691.Also helping was Congressional testimony by the SEC and CFTC heads, in which the two didn't seem to be in a hurry to put the regulatory screws to the market. CFTC Chairman Giancarlo: "We owe it this new generation to respect their enthusiasm about virtual currencies with a thoughtful and balanced response, not a dismissive one.”OTCQX:GBTC +18.1%Previously: SEC's Clayton: ICOs need to be regulated like securities offerings (Feb. 6)Previously: Crypto exodus: Bitcoin falls below $6,000 (Feb. 6)
