Like banks and cards today, that first fee would likely be waived if you made some minimum deposit. Then the transaction fees  still exist, but competition will quickly erode them to something palatable to consumers. After all, the channel owner wants to maximize revenue, and ultimately that means maximizing transactions.

TLDR from the conclusion section: "Primitive money was not modern money as we know it. It took on some of the function modern money now performs, but its form was that of heirlooms, jewelry, and other collectibles. The use of these is so ancient that the desires to explore, collect, make, display, appraise, carefully store, and trade collectibles are human universals – to some extent instincts. This constellation of human desires might be called the collecting instinct. Searching for the raw materials, such as shells and teeth, and manufacturing of collectibles took up a considerable portion of many ancient humans' time, just as many modern humans expend substantial resources on these activities as hobbies. The results for our ancient forebears were the first secure forms of embodied value very different from concrete utility – and the forerunner of today's money."

I'm not comfortable with current debt levels, but I don't think this article makes the connection it wants to make. 
Lots of global *trade* is denominated in dollars - true. But most global *debt* is priced in the native currency. Japanese debt (which is scary high) is almost all in Japanese yen. 
So the domino effect that starts with tariffs, leading to dollars being "tough" to get, leading to debt defaults, will only happen with developing countries who denominate in US dollars.

Totally agree, but 100 million is no small number. Out of 7+ billion, sure, but consider that all the middle classes combined probably add up to 1 billion, and most of them are not investing outside of preset programs like ETFs. So 100 million ends-up being a significant fraction of the investing public.
The only way to hit these numbers is to get outside the investor class. And that means bitcoin has to be spendable. Being a hedge against disaster won't cut it.

Ten years and counting.
The web was invented in 1990.
By 2000, it was already consumer friendly.

Ah. So they claim the system is stuck, yet they show a stack of active buys and sells, any one of which could fill your order. That is definitely odd. Does it automatically mean the trades are fake? Not necessarily - it's hard to know from the outside if their software can leave an order stranded. The new orders could still flow unaffected. Unless they claim all trading has stopped?
Either way, it is shitty service. And two weeks? What are they doing, building it from scratch?

How perfectly you just described crypto's adoption problem.

It's not a bag, it's a bundle.

If this is an AMA, what is your unique thesis as to why (and maybe when) Bitcoin will succeed?
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:02:30
If people cared about the tech, they'd be buying books about bitcoin, not bitcoin itself.
Maybe if the developers cared more about the tech, we'd have easier to use tech, and therefore more adoption.

Screenshot of a chat between two unnamed people. Is this evidence? If you're trying to help people here, and yourself, you have to provide something more substantial.  EDIT: Maybe talk to these guys

People in their teens and twenties may still be adolescent, but they always were. Only back in the day, they got to drive cars and drink and fuck and get an apartment with their girlfriend on shitty wages. Now shitty wages don't cover that. So they play video games.
No adolescent wants to live with their parents. Not now, not ever.
Time to drop the narrative.
(And for the record I'm a Gen-X "slacker", if you don't know what that is, look it up.)

Apparently if you hodl too long they go stale.
Relax, is joke from old country.

This needs to be a post.

I count that as a Bitcoin search by association.

So you are hedging the other 80% of your portfolio (which would suffer in that scenario) with Bitcoin, and only Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:05:06
Agreed. If not an outright ban, mods could at least mod a little harder.

I think you just trolled Banksy's trolling of the art world. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:36:42
Bravo. For people who get tech, but don't get Bitcoin, this is a level-headed intro.
