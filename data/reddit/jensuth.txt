Allow me to be explicit: Government in any form is crap; democracy (even when functioning) is bullshit. You will not allocate capital well when you gain control of that capital by force, and if you need not use force (say, everybody agrees on something), then you don't need government.

* A transaction fee cannot be recovered by the thief; it serves as an inescapable cost to his fraud, albeit one that is probably only useful for very cheap items.
* If, as a merchant, you make that decision, then you are deciding that a customer must wait for some minimum number of confirmations before receiving his due.
    Consider that most transactions in the real world involve the service being delivered before a payment is made, even without any legal contract being signed; this is because the world actually operates on a great deal of trust, anyway, and any abuse of this trust is written off as the cost of business.
* Bitcoin is not, never has been, and never will be suitable for zero-confirmation transactions under situations where fraud is likely. The present system depends on the *convention* of network nodes, and is therefore fundamentally untrustworthy—there's certainly nothing today to keep a thief from submitting double spends directly to miners who don't give a damn.
    If, as a merchant, you want greater assurance, you'll either have to wait for confirmations or use some other system where trust is built up beforehand.
* The false security of zero-confirmation transactions that currently exists is worth less than RBF.

But what about the privacy of others?
If your restaurant displays a static address, then it's possible to assign a geographic location to transactions which use that address.
It's possible to associate two seemingly unrelated people—if not 2 patrons, then at least a patron to a recipient; I would never make a donation to a static Wikileaks address, because then I might be associated with aiding Wikileaks.
And so on. I'm sure you can come up with better examples on your own.

Nothing in Bitcoin is encrypted; it's most likely that the average individual is submitting his own transactions in the clear from an IP address that is associated with him. It's even worse, given that a lot of people buy BTC on, say, Coinbase (who keep virtual DNA samples on their clients) and then pay from within their service, as well.
@_date: 2015-12-21 08:50:32
Reconsider based on *what?* Besides, you don't know how conditions will change between submitting a transaction and having it confirmed. You know how I'd decide? "Hmmm... my transaction isn't going through as quickly as I'd like... I guess I'll up the fee!"
My friend, access is *already* and *always will be* a game of "who's got the deeper pockets"; the reason why is admittedly unsettling, but not nefarious:
* The Universe is indifferent to your suffering; *someone* has to pay.

Well, it seems like the OB guys are smart to make their system look like it has no intention of being used anonymously, so as to keep officials off their backs.
However, it also seems like it would be easy to run a whole network of stores entirely within the [i2p&amp;nbsp;network]( or possibly within the Tor network as hidden services.

Well, frankly, I wouldn't want the politicians deep in the control of general interests, either; the average voter is profoundly stupid.
The only vote that has a hope of producing useful results is the vote someone makes by allocating his capital in some way; capitalism is the only way that solutions are found and—perhaps more importantly—the best way to ensure that bad ideas wither away.

You know what has more use cases? Being able to update a transaction fee.
If you extend the definition of Truth to include the mempool, then you're going to find that at that level, Truth is both difficult to calculate, *and* undesirably unlikely, anyway, at least when disregarding the fact that most people are actually fairly trustworthy.
A better solution is to make it possible for a recipient to pay for his desired level of risk protection by somehow setting the fee, say by issuing another transaction that uses the payment as an input; this becomes a possibility when transaction malleability is fixed.
EDIT: A merchant can reject a transaction that doesn't have a "suitable" fee already—and then the sender can use RBF to re-issue the transaction with an appropriate fee, to boot!
@_date: 2015-12-23 00:11:39

It doesn't have to be scuttled; a merchant can reject a transaction that doesn't have a "suitable" fee already (and then the sender can use RBF to re-issue the transaction with an appropriate fee, to boot!), or when transaction malleability is fixed, a merchant could force the issue by using the payment as an input in one of his own transactions with a suitably high fee to make the original payment attractive to a miner, etc.
That is, the merchant should be responsible for managing his own damn risk.
One who is risk averse can pay the network more money to keep him safer than one who doesn't care so much—let the market figure out hard policy, rather than rely on node *convention!*

Because a merchant could reject a transaction that doesn't have some suitably high initial "fee"; that is, the merchant could require the customer to use... wait for it... *RBF* to re-issue the transaction with a higher fee, thereby effectively allowing the merchant to set the fee high enough to make fraud less attractive.
Alternatively, when transaction malleability is fixed, the merchant himself could issue another transaction that both uses the payment as an input and itself includes a sizable fee, so as to make the payment more attractive to a miner.
The market needs to decide its own policy for risk management, rather than rely on the *convention* of nodes in the Bitcoin network.

Block space *is* a scarce resource.
"The rich get richer" is definitely an outcome of capitalism, but only because that's implied by "Those with capital get more capital"; *everyone* has capital—a rising tide lifts all boats, and so forth; "the poor get richer" is a thing, too.
The reason you are confused is that the rich (specifically, giant corporations) use the violence of the state to prop themselves up artificially; under capitalism, there is no such thing as "Too Big to Fail" (i.e, "Too Big to *Let* Fail")—under capitalism, if your allocation of capital is consistently poor, [then you will lose your right to allocate capital](
In particular, under capitalism, in the long run, those corporations with bigger pockets of which you speak can only keep doing that if it's actually profitable to the wider world, thereby making *everyone* better off.

Well, unless you're one of the handful...
Imagine if, instead, protocol changes could be made opt-in, and if it were always possible for any user to revert to some older protocol. [Could sidechains provide this possibility?]( What about extension blocks?
There *must* be some, more general way to set the system up, so that the market is free to experiment with all manner of protocols, and thereby *discover* the right ideas evolutionarily without such massive, deliberate, nearly centralized coordination. One user's experiment should not be another user's burden.
If that is even remotely possible, then a hard fork to achieve such a robust system should be the only goal; it would be a hard fork to end all forks.

@_date: 2015-12-23 16:01:31
See [the FAQ]( that was just recently posted to it answers many of your questions, or provides the foundation for answers.
* Hard forks are serious business, and upping the block size requires more than just changing one line of code.
    Most of the changes, like SegWit, can be put into place *now* as *soft* forks, allowing for a greater degree of opt-in experimentation; should a hard fork become the obvious path, *then* those soft forks could be re-written more eloquently at the same time, using the knowledge gained from the soft forks.
* SegWit has been around a long time, and has been part of the research that Blockstream has done for its sidechain named Alpha, which is part of Blockstream's Elements project.
    It was discovered that SegWit could be implemented in Bitcoin via a soft fork, and so that's why that work is now underway, and—as the FAQ points out—it *will* be tested using its own testnet and put into place using an opt-in system for both the protocol and the usage.
* A soft fork is desirable.
* As the FAQ points out, SegWit reduces the size of transactions, thereby making a SegWit transaction cheaper; people like cheaper transactions, and that's why they'd use it.
    SegWit also fixes transaction malleability at a very fundamental level; indeed, this is the most important aspect of SegWit, as the ability to rely on a particular transaction ultimately making it into the blockchain opens up many doors for Bitcoin.
    Bitcoin cannot be scaled meaningfully unless transaction malleability is fixed, even if only to allow chaining unconfirmed transactions.
* Bitcoin is the coldest, most unforgiving, least trusting system; these properties mean that Bitcoin is more expensive than necessary for most transactions.
    Another system, such as a sidechain or an overlay like LN, can cater to a different model for transactions that don't require the guarantees that Bitcoin provides.
    The solution is obvious: Get shit done in a system other than Bitcoin, but periodically tie that shit back to Bitcoin so as to meet some desired level of guarantees.
* Bitcoin has *never* provided unlimited space, simply because the universe does not provide unlimited space.
    There have been many analyses; the crux is that *someone* needs to pay to run the Bitcoin network, and that the cost of doing so is actually pretty massive: To keep fees low, transaction volume must increase drastically, but in a way that keeps the blockchain (as well as the time required to process it) from growing drastically at the same time, and that last requirement is *precisely* what many of these new developments are aimed at doing.
* The reason a fee market is important is because it gives the world information about which transactions are most valuable, so that the Bitcoin network can order its work meaningfully.
* Who is BTCDrak? *Who gives a fuck?!* Just because you're an incompetent fool doesn't mean that the rest of us are; read code and think, rather than rely on something as stupid as ancient human social heuristics.
* I don't work for Blockstream, but it seems obvious their revenue will be from helping institutions set up custom networks that can be tied back to Bitcoin.
    Bitcoin cannot and should not do try to do everything; it does one thing well: Provide the strictest guarantees for transactions. Other networks (such as sidechains) can be set up to cater to less stringent needs, and Blockstream could provide the consultation and even the administration for doing so.

    When transaction volume is low, I can get away with a low fee even for important transactions, but when transaction volume shoots up *for whatever reason*, I need to be able to repeat my bid under those new conditions.
    People have already gotten fucked by transactions that won't clear quickly enough for their purposes, and would have gladly upped their fees if only they could have.

@_date: 2015-12-23 01:04:21
You are wrong, of course.
The ability to chain transactions without the fear that an ancestor transaction in the chain may suffer from transaction malleability is essential to more rapid transaction turnover—it is essential to the smooth fulfillment of a user's expectations about how he can transfer his own coins.
As it is now, you can easily exhaust your suppy of available transaction inputs; your own change transactions cannot necessarily be used as inputs, because of transaction malleability, and thus you must *wait* for your own change transactions to be confirmed before continuing with your spending.
Under transaction malleability, Bitcoin growth is an absurd proposition.

In fact, if the community persists in promoting this ridiculous abuse of convention, I will personally put effort into convincing miners to accept double spends, and I will personally pay for the code that will make it easy for thieves to submit their fraudulent double spends to said miners.

Well, consider that you identify governmental meddling as a major source of the world's economic problems; indeed, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin—its ability to allude governmental manipulation—is probably why you and others find it intriguing as a store of wealth. It puts power into the hands of each individual; it provides a means for implementing Capitalism.
Yet, it's still far too troublesome even for the competent user to allude Big Brother's prying eye, and whatever His eye sees is that for which His hand begins to reach; in order for Bitcoin to be the store of wealth you want, as many avenues of governmental involvement as possible must be shut.
It doesn't matter how decentralized the network is if economic activity is not sufficiently private.

Indeed. Right now, Bitcoin Classic could set up a fairly trustless federated peg to allow its supporters to put their money where there mouths are by transferring their real BTC to a Bitcoin Classic sidechain secured at first either by the federation or at least by a different PoW algorithm.
Then, as Bitcoin Classic proves its worth and gains support, it could help Bitcoin \[Core\] with [a&amp;nbsp;soft&amp;nbsp;fork]( to allow a more decentralized 'symmetric SPV-proof 2-way peg', and thereby transition itself into a fully PoW model to coax staunch, purist Bitcoin users to make the transition themselves.
Perhaps this sidechain could be programmed to *continue* Bitcoin's miner reward after some threshold amount of old BTC has been transferred over, or some other metric, and thereby pinch off its connection to the old system, making Bitcoin Classic the new Bitcoin.
All of this without a hard fork; all of this without forcing people to take a leap of faith at the beginning of the experiment.

    I suspect you would disagree; I suspect what you are actually trying to say is that a government should have direct control over the parameters of the currency that it uses.
* With regard to what you call a deflationary currency, it's only bad for a government to adopt such a currency if you want a government to be able to secretly tax holders of the currency by stealing purchasing power from them through the creation of new currency units.

**Who is to say what usage is worthwhile?**
* If a transaction is processed into a blockchain, then that transaction is not spam with respect to that blockchain.
Fees are part of how the market determines what exactly constitutes spam.
The [Tragedy of the Commons]( can be curtailed with, say, usage fees that grow until there's proper equilibrium, whereby the resource in question is too expensive to consume unless that consumption is profitably useful.
More precisely, if there is a shortage in resource *Y*, then the market responds by increasing the fee for using *Y*, which serves 2 purposes:
* **This is a spam filter that serves to avoid the Tragedy of the Commons.**
    The rising fee establishes a stricter ordering to the demand; it forces the market to recognize that one usage of *Y* is more important than some other usage of *Y*, thereby imposing a more efficient allocation of capital throughout the market.
    Part of the problem is that Bitcoin doesn't yet have good tools for implementing price discovery. Not only is it difficult to determine which fee represents this spam filter's threshold, but it's currently troublesome to update a fee so that it better represents the intentions of the user.
    These problems can be at least partially solved by [simplifying limit calculations]( via a hard&amp;nbsp;fork, and by improving policy (*i.e.,* node configuration) via streamlining priority calculations and widely implementing both [Replace-by-Fee]( and [Child-Pays-for-Parent](
    Similarly, you could maybe make an argument that older *transactions* in the mempool should have higher priority, so as to *simulate* multiple fee-based spam-filter thresholds, but that's entirely reliant on some sense of altruism (kinship reciprocation at the least); it's probably better to identify particular use cases around which capacity can be explicitly expanded.
* **This is a signal that someone should figure out how to increase capacity in some way.**
    The rising fee alerts the market to the fact that there is a growing inefficiency in the system: There is unmet demand, or there has been a loss in productivity. This signals where capital *might* be worth investing, a choice that is made by comparing all such signals.
    For instance, perhaps the vast majority of \[profitable\] transactions in the Bitcoin system involve the use of BTC as a currency; in that case, it might be wise to construct a solution that increases the capacity [*specifically* for currency usage](

The future holds solutions that will make using BTC to buy coffee almost infinitely easier than it has ever been.
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:05:48
You are confusing a couple of things.
Blockstream's [whitepaper]( mentions several ways that a 2-way peg can be constructed, and concentrates on a particular one, due to its relative simplicity to model, scale, and deploy:
* **the Symmetric SPV-proof 2-way Peg**
This method allows for arbitrarily strong security; if you want to improve *exponentially* the probability that a transfer is valid, just wait a little longer. This is similar to how normal SPV Bitcoin clients work, but the paper notes that further additional information can be included with the transfer in order to make that process even more robust, but that's just a detail.
In any case, it is not envisioned that 2-way pegs be used regularly or for small transfers, both because trusting the validity requires waiting a not-insignificant amount of time (perhaps a few days) and because the SPV-proofs are not-insignificant in size (though the whitepaper describes a pretty interesting way to make them quite compact).
Instead, it is intended that large transfers be made, and then people on both sides of the peg can simply trade their coins nearly instantly using an already well-established, robust, trustless method that works *today* across blockchain systems that are not even pegged:
* **the Atomic Swap** (which is also described in the paper).
What makes the atomic swap even more useful for pegged blockchains than for non-pegged blockchains is that there is no volatility in price (because the tokens are pegged), which greatly simplifies the market for (*i.e.,* the organizing of) swaps.
Now, how does a blockchain system check an SPV proof? Well, a new system created specifically to be a sidechain certainly can be programmed from the start to understand them, but what about Bitcoin, which was designed before the concept of an SPV proof was even developed? There are 2 approaches:
* If (or when) Bitcoin's script language is finally made just slightly more powerful (perhaps even as powerful as it was when Satoshi first released it), then it will be possible to describe the validation process using just Bitcoin's script; that is to say, if the Bitcoin world ever wants even slightly smart contracts, then that implies the Bitcoin world wants to allow for the permissionless creation of symmetric SPV-proof 2-way pegs.
    Such improvements to Bitcoin's script can be introduced with a soft fork.
* Because 2-way pegs are awesome, and are clearly the future of the Internet of Money, it would be silly to require the overhead inherent in describing them with generic Bitcoin script primitives; instead, it makes a lot more sense to build that description directly into Bitcoin by creating a script primitive dedicated to SPV-proof validation.
    Such augmentation to Bitcoin's script can be introduced with a soft fork.
Of course, a soft fork is not quite permissionless to deploy; it requires significant approval from the Bitcoin world, and it's difficult to get that approval unless you can demonstrate the correctness of your plan. Yet, how can that be demonstrated without implementing sidechains with which real-world value can be experimented? Simple:
* **the Federated Peg**
The insight here is that any missing functionality in Bitcoin's script processing can already be provided permissionlessly by a third party, *and* that this third party need not be particularly trusted. The paper thus describes what is called a federated peg, which not only can provide arbitrarily distributed trust, but also allows for users in the Bitcoin world to send and receive transactions from others without even realizing that the coins are making their way through a 2-way peg! (It merely appears that coins are being sent through a multisignature address.)
The federated peg is actually suited to private blockchains that are interesting to a consortium of mutually distrusting organizations (*e.g.,* banks). It's also an excellent way to bootstrap and maintain a minimum degree of security for a sidechain that is ultimately meant to transition to a symmetric SPV-proof 2-way pegs in the long term.
Hence, using the federated peg will allow for a nascent Internet of Money to begin to develop, proving the worth of sidechains.
**tl;dr:** A 2-way peg can be made arbitrarily secure, can be deployed permissionlessly already, and won't even be an issue for everyday use between \[important\] sidechains, anyway.

'Appeal to authority'. That does not mean what you think it means.
@_date: 2016-03-03 06:06:21
Thank you for the thought experiment; here is my stream of consciousness on the matter.
Firstly, 'Bitcoin' is the system, and 'bitcoin' or 'BTC' is the unit of account; 'Bitcoin' is not the same as 'bitcoin'; it's better to use 'BTC' or the like.
You say that the decision is official, so by 'a country decides', you mean 'a government decides' (or at least, 'the organization that issues the currency decides').
In that case, presumably, the organization in question would somehow accrue an amount of BTC that is equivalent to the worth of the economy as denoted in the old currency (in other words, back the old currency with BTC), and then inform its users/constituents that they can and should trade in their old fiat currency for BTC; there would naturally be a period of transition in which both tokens (the old currency and the BTC) would be used in the market, with the goal being that the old currency becomes completely phased out.
In practice, this could never happen; I personally cannot fathom how such a conversion rate could possibly be established, or how the organization in question would manage to procure the necessary BTC—it would require strange deals with the suppliers of the BTC.
Were such a conversion to occur, it would be through market forces, in which case there would still be a period of transition where both the old currency and the new currency would be used simultaneously, but the old currency would lose purchasing power until it bacame useless, and the last ones holding onto it would indeed suffer from their poor choice in money; as [pointed&amp;nbsp;out]( people would naturally be accruing BTC through work rather than exchange between currencies, and so hopefully most people would naturally phase out the old currency with as little disruption as possible.

**At the very least, Gavin's proposal should be limited to legacy non-SegWit transactions.**
Non-SegWit transactions should be phased out entirely, leading to an overall superior approach:
* &gt; [Linear scaling of sighash operations](
    -------------
    &gt; A major problem with simple approaches to increasing the Bitcoin blocksize is that for certain transactions, signature-hashing scales quadratically rather than linearly.
    &gt; In essence, doubling the size of a transaction increases can double both the number of signature operations, and the amount of data that has to be hashed for each of those signatures to be verified. This has been seen in the wild, where an individual block required 25 seconds to validate, and maliciously designed transactions could take over 3 minutes.
    &gt; Segwit resolves this by changing the calculation of the transaction hash for signatures so that each byte of a transaction only needs to be hashed at most twice. This provides the same functionality more efficiently, so that large transactions can still be generated without running into problems due to signature hashing, even if they are generated maliciously or much larger blocks (and therefore larger transactions) are supported.
    &gt; **Who benefits?**
    &gt; Removing the quadratic scaling of hashed data for verifying signatures makes increasing the block size safer. Doing that **without also limiting transaction sizes** allows Bitcoin to continue to support payments that go to or come from large groups, such as payments of mining rewards or crowdfunding services.
    &gt; The modified hash only applies to signature operations initiated from witness data, so signature operations from the base block will continue to require lower limits.
* &gt; [Moving towards **a single combined block limit**](
    -------------
    &gt; Currently there are two consensus-enforced limits on blocksize: the block can be no larger than 1MB and, independently, there can be no more than 20,000 signature checks performed across the transactions in the block.
    &gt; Finding the most profitable set of transactions to include in a block given a single limit is an instance of the knapsack problem, which can be easily solved almost perfectly with a simple greedy algorithm. However adding the second constraint makes finding a good solution very hard in some cases, and this theoretical problem has been exploited in practice to force blocks to be mined at a size well below capacity.
    &gt; It is not possible to solve this problem without either a **hardfork**, or substantially decreasing the block size. Since segwit can’t fix the problem, it settles on not making it worse: in particular, rather than introducing an independent limit for the segregated witness data, instead a single limit is applied to the weighted sum of the UTXO data and the witness data, allowing both to be limited simultaneously as a combined entity.
    &gt; **Who benefits?**
    &gt; Ultimately miners will benefit if a future hardfork that changes the block capacity limit to be a single weighted sum of parameters. For example:
    &gt;     50*sigops + 4*basedata + 1*witnessdata &lt; 10M
    &gt; **This lets miners easily and accurately fill blocks while maximising fee income, and that will benefit users by allowing them to more reliably calculate the appropriate fee needed for their transaction to be mined.**

As we've established the notion that truth is a probability, then the obvious answer is that bootstrapping a node is merely a question of choosing and then successfully calculating a sufficiently high probability of truthfulness for the data on which the node will base its operations—Bitcoin already does exactly this, but potentially with, effectively, an unnecessarily high choice for that probability.
The more general point is thus: It's important to think clearly, so that you don't get stuck solving a much harder problem than you need to solve; Bitcoin can scale much more, merely because it need only solve a much weaker problem than people have hitherto thought it must solve—people have been confusing Bitcoin's *current* implementation with its purpose.

The engineers are not deciding anything; no imposition is being placed on an already working system—for better or for worse, the *actual* system is merely running as it has organically evolved to run.
The fee market will decide, organically, a well-defined ordering for what is valuable; that is, Bitcoin provides tools for handling gracefully this sort of 'failure'.
**In the meantime, engineers are working very hard to yield a properly engineered solution to this 'failure'—not a half-baked kludge, but a properly engineered solution.**

* The keystone of your position is that the direction of the Bitcoin consensus rules has been or easily could be controlled by Blockstream; yet, I don't see how that's possible.
    So what if the developers in question are maneuvering Bitcoin to increase their own personal wealth through Blockstream's desired business model; if their maneuvering doesn't ultimately benefit everyone else sufficiently, then everyone else (including myself) will gladly rally behind a better set of software.
    The reason Blockstream devs look like they have grabbed control of Bitcoin development is because their ideas are actually good.
* It's unclear exactly what Blockstream's business plan is supposed to be; however, we can infer that it involves private blockchains and consultations on blockchain technology. R3 is also working on private blockchains, so Blockstream must be evil, right?
    The difference is that Blockstream's solution can tie these private blockchains directly to Bitcoin via 2-way pegs; this makes BTC an extremely valuable common medium of exchange amongst all the private systems that wish to be so connected—in fact, it's better than that; because of the guiding principles of robust decentralization above all else, it serves as a refuge to store value when there's doubt in the rest of the system.
    Blockstream's solution makes Bitcoin the backbone of an **Internet&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Money.**

The shift involves yet another case of the Tragedy of the Commons; it's unclear how to put a fee on *centralization* (for lack of a more obvious term); it's unclear how to induce the market to allocate its resources in a way that doesn't destroy that which makes Bitcoin actually interesting.

There is contention between scaling and decentralization. We do NOT know how to navigate that contention.

Fixing transaction malleability is far more important than making life easier for programmers.
Transaction malleability destroys the ability to make stable chains of unconfirmed transactions, including chains involving one's own change transactions.
* This hobbles usability of Bitcoin right now, because a user must effectively wait for each transaction to become sufficiently confirmed before using it as an input in another transaction, significantly reducing turnaround in spending.
* This also has ramifications that hinder the development of more sophisticated overlay networks such as the Lightning Network, whose hub-and-spoke design currently cannot operate robustly until transaction malleability is fixed.
Much to the surprise of everyone, as a bonus, SegWit provides additional capacity improvements, as well as the potential to introduce further features that become much easier to integrate.

* There's no such thing as a block that isn't full.

    Shifting the cost of Bitcoin from fees to capacity through an increase in the block-size limit could threaten decentralization without even offering significant scaling.
    Besides, we don't really know how to make that shift smoothly, anyway.
* It's not clear that 'losing' transactions through rising fees will adversely affect the profitability to the ecosystem; it might even improve it; the market is deciding how capital should be allocated.

* If others shut off their equipment, then the rate at which blocks are found decreases even further; this could potentially reduce the supply of BTC on exchanges enough to drive the price of BTC up, thereby improving the ROI.
* If other miners turn off their equipment, then the rate of confirmation drops.

Perhaps one should make a distinction between centralization and \[voluntary\] cooperation: Centralization is a phenomenon that occurs under coercion or cooperation; centralization is undesirable when it involves imposition, but desirable when it improves efficiency.
Unfortunately, centralization that starts out as cooperation can end up as coercion.
Though a slight misnomer, the term 'decentralization' refers to the establishment of structures that clearly demarcate and eliminate (or otherwise suppress) some kind of coercion; revolution is intended to involve decentralization.
Thus, without contradiction, a 'decentralized' system permits some centralization; more precisely, a 'decentralized' system permits cooperation. What makes a system 'decentralized' is that it, within its purpose, denies coercion—when coercion appears, it is so easy to identify and route around, that it cannot last long enough to make a significant impact.
Let us hope that Bitcoin and its ecosystem can be engineered well enough to achieve this 'decentralization'.

People have successfully used BTC as money. However, while currency is necessarily money, money is not necessarily currency.
People are trying to use BTC as a currency, but they find their efforts frustrated by the fact that Bitcoin (the&amp;nbsp;system) currently only confers to BTC the properties of settlement; these properties are not sufficient to constitute the properties of a currency.
In order to [make BTC actually useable as a currency]( the Bitcoin system needs to be changed; yet, rather than change the Bitcoin system directly, it should be sufficient to build on top of Bitcoin another system that is specifically tailored toward using BTC as a currency, and thereby confer to BTC the properties of a currency.

The information in question could be submitted with each licensing fee transaction for the purposes of validation by the wider network, and then that information could be thrown away by the wider network as more blocks are piled on top of that validation.
That is, in fact, pruning.
In other words, the information is known to those who care about it—the network at large might care about it for a lot less time than the nodes who want to get paid for having it at any time.
However, it seems more likely that those information-storing nodes would organize themselves into their own well-delineated system that interfaces with Bitcoin via a 2-way peg; it would probably be cheaper to run such a specialized network, rather than rely on a more general network.

A transaction flies around at the speed of the Internet, just like an email. This has always been the case, and remains so.
However, what matters is the Bitcoin network's confirmation of that transaction; the whole point of Bitcoin is to receive trustless confirmation that grows exponentially stronger with time.
**There's a reason it's called "0-conf": Such a transaction has received ZERO confirmation from the Bitcoin network.**
The current rules for "protecting" a 0-conf transaction are not enforced by Proof of Work; the current rules are merely convention that can be ignored by any node in the Bitcoin network. It's a service that the Bitcoin network does not really provide, and it's a mistake for that convention to exist as part of Core of the ecosystem.
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:03:16


That's unacceptable for a supposedly decentralized system of sound money.
@_date: 2016-01-28 00:21:27


It should be noted that only the pegging mechanism must currently be federated, and the controlling federation can be made arbitrarily trustless (by distributing authority widely, or employing some sophisticated algorithm, etc.).
That being said, beyond [the pegging mechanism]( Bitcoin and Rootstock are completely independent systems.
In theory, Rootstock could be just as decentralized as Bitcoin; it could use a completely different Proof-of-Work algorithm to protect it from attacks; it could use a federation as a fall-back method if the decentralized proof-of-work is not yet strong enough; it could use something entirely new—Rootstock need not even be blockchain-based.
@_date: 2016-03-02 16:06:56
* Rootstock is more complex than Bitcoin; reasoning about the problems of Rootstock is a much more intractable problem than reasoning about the problems of Bitcoin. That makes the success of Rootstock more doubtful than the success of Bitcoin.
    Once a user is done using Rootstock, he can escape back to the safety of Bitcoin. That is, Bitcoin will still be superior for the risk averse; at least at first, Bitcoin will still offer value to the market.
* What if Rootstock *does* indeed provide what amounts to a superior version of Bitcoin; then, would it not be a good outcome for the ecosystem to ditch the old, decrepit system in favor of switching to the new one?
    That is, the possibility of a [*competing* sidechain]( means the possibility of even the core of a complex ecosystem of sidechains to be improved without forcing \[nearly\] anyone to comply with some experimental alteration that is untested in the real world; the core could evolve according to the organic, objective, measurable, voluntary choices of its users.
@_date: 2016-03-02 17:41:11


If so, that's only because there's a great deal more trustworthiness in the world than is assumed by Bitcoin (the consensus system).
It was and is a mistake to have imported into the design of the Bitcoin network the inherent reliance of our social species on kinship-level trust to get shit done.
The *core* protocol of this ecosystem is not the right place for dealing with zero-confirmation transactions; it's literally outside of the scope of Bitcoin.
To build the ecosystem around Bitcoin-protocol transactions with zero confirmations is to build the ecosystem on a foundation of sand.
The whole point of Bitcoin is that it provides a rigorous definition of risk—*but only for blocks!*
When the Bitcoin network begins producing confirmations of a transaction, that's when the transaction has 'manageable&amp;nbsp;risk', *and not a moment before!*
It is not possible to apply the term 'manageable&amp;nbsp;risk' to a transaction that—*by&amp;nbsp;definition*—exists outside the scope of 'manageable&amp;nbsp;risk'.
Zero confirmation means the Bitcoin network has not given the okay, *and may never do so*. It is what it is; stop trying to make it more than it is.
Your only hope is a higher-level protocol that *simulates* instant confirmation by largely taking care of confirmation in advance (e.g., the Lightning Network, or some centralized network, etc.).
According to the consensus algorithm, a chain of blocks must merely be consistent to be chosen by the network; a block must merely be consistent with respect to the chain on which it is built.
* It's *entirely* the choice of the miner as to which transaction among conflicting transactions to process.
* In general, it's *entirely* the choice of the node as to which transaction among conflicting transactions to process.
I mean, how do you know whether a transaction has been propagated to hundreds of nodes?
Satoshi told us how: The longest chain of proof of work. That&amp;nbsp;is, in&amp;nbsp;fact, what consensus is; that&amp;nbsp;is, in&amp;nbsp;fact, just a restatement of the whole point of Bitcoin.
While one transaction might make it to hundreds of nodes, so might its double spender; it takes but one miner to include in the blockchain the 'wrong' transaction, so that eventually even those hundreds abandon the 'right' transaction as they all descend upon consensus with exponentially growing fortitude. We don't know what the network thinks until it gives us the blocks.
Blocks are what matter, my friend. You've got to wait for the blocks.

* Given a choice between decentralization and cheapness, Bitcoin is only interesting if it provides decentralization.
    So, it turns out that it's better to use Bitcoin as a hardened settlement layer, and then build other models of value transfer on top to cater to truly cheap and voluminous transactions. In that case, what's actually important is the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.

* The transactions of the world are not uniform in their requirements; there are various profiles of risk and cost and speed and payload—*and any other property you can think of!* Indeed, there is more trust in the world than Bitcoin assumes, and that trust can be used by some profiles in order to benefit everyone.
    No single system can simultaneously cater to all profiles.
    The profile that Bitcoin was designed to serve entails decentralized, trustless processing of "small casual transactions"—and of these properties, decentralization is paramount; after all, you can construct a cheap and high-volume payment system on top of a decentralized system of nearly any sort, but you cannot construct a decentralized system on top of a centralized system of any sort.
    So, above all else, the *Core* of the Bitcoin system must provide decentralized, trustless processing of transactions; once that goal has been met, an overlay network (like the Lightning Network) can be used to construct Bitcoin transactions in a way that is smarter than simply using Bitcoin directly. Furthermore, Bitcoin's token, BTC, can be pegged to the tokens of other systems that cater to all manner of different profiles.
    In this way, every possible profile can be serviced and yet tied together with a common token, BTC; when there is doubt in the ecosystem, users can retreat to the safety of the cold, heartless, trustlesss core that is Bitcoin.
    This makes Bitcoin the *Core* of an Internet of Money.

Fortunately, the Bitcoin ***Core*** developers understand this principle very well, and are doing their best to make sure that Bitcoin can be coaxed into becoming the backbone of the [Internet of Money]( wherein all manner of innovation can occur in overlays and sidechains that are interlinked through BTC as the common medium of exchange.

Andreas (makes [a commonly repeated mistake]( of terminology regarding the nature of soft&amp;nbsp;fork compatibility:










He's almost got it, but then misapplies the term 'forwards compatible' to the concept of a soft fork.
Forward compatibility is the deliberate introduction of structure into a system in preparation for the possibility of making some unknown backward compatible alteration to that system in the future; that is, forward compatibility is the deliberate removal of unnecessary assumptions, so that there is greater flexibility to change things in the future.
**Bitcoin is *forward* compatible.**
* A hard fork is the introduction of a new version of Bitcoin that is *not* backward compatible. Because it is not backward compatible, it makes no difference that the old version of Bitcoin was made to be forward compatible; the new version breaks assumptions in the old version—there is not compatibility of any sort.
* A soft fork is the introduction of a new version of Bitcoin that is backward compatible; it is made backward compatible by virtue of the fact that the old version of Bitcoin was made forward compatible.
    To be explicit, a soft fork is a backward compatible change.  
**A soft fork is *backward* compatible.**

You're missing the point entirely.
The point is twofold:
* *The obvious:*  
If the market thinks that certain transactions constitute spam, then the market must take steps to prevent those transactions from being processed.
* *The apparently-not-so obvious:*  
A fee market is an essential component of a decentralized means by which to take those steps.
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:00:54
Yes! Absolutely!
However, it's just another case of the Tragedy of the Commons; it's unclear how to put a fee on *centralization*; it's unclear how to induce the market to allocate its resources in a way that doesn't destroy that which makes Bitcoin actually interesting.
In 100 years, people will look back and think fondly about how quaint we were—how our problems were such low-hanging fruit. Unfortunately, in the present, while we know we want some fruit, we just cannot see it hanging in front of us.
There is contention between scaling and decentralization. We do NOT know how to navigate that contention.

* [Gregory Maxwell](
    &gt;&gt; Is it a way to prevent miners on the majority fork from using their larger amount of hash power to attack the minority fork?
    &gt; Correct. The reasonable thing for the users of a crypto-currency to do if miners attack their system is to change the POW. **All I was answering to was feasibility**, and that code had already been submitted to classic to consider that. (Per-normal practice Core wouldn't consider it unless it was considered urgent)
* [Gregory Maxwell](
    &gt; **I was just answering to feasibility.** Changing the POW is a well understood, though extreme, measure available to address dysfunction in the mining ecosystem.
    &gt; If miners do something that harms some network of nodes; thats exactly what they'll do. And Luke-Jr had already offered a patch to Classic to address the complaints Mike's article was making.
* [Gregory Maxwell](
    &gt; **There are no \[plans to change PoW\]** that I'm aware of currently (or at least none that I'm aware of); but "users can choose to change the POW" has always been the answer to the "what happens if a very powerful miner tries to force something onto the network?".
    &gt; This, among other reasons, is why miners have minimal technical authority in Bitcoin hardforks: if you mine blocks that are hardfork incompatible with a system, you're simply not mining as far as that system is concerned.

Let's say there are 3 miners and 1 billion full nodes.
If I just connect randomly to some nodes to get data, chances are that I'm going to connect to full nodes only.
If those full nodes are sufficiently decentralized (meaning there is no real chance that I'm going to be hoodwinked by a special interest), then they are going to act like a filter for whatever the miners produce; if the miners produce junk, then it will never get to me, because the web of full nodes will refuse to pass around that junk, as doing so would hurt that full node's general interests (and even its special interests).
As with the miners, though, the question remains: How does one induce decentralization that is sufficient? At some level in the network of nodes, there must be sustainable decentralization.

Suppose, that it becomes a recognized legal process in the courts to prove the chronology of a marriage proposal by demonstrating said probability.
In that case, it is imaginable that there would be a thriving industry around maintaining marriage proposal data precisely; that industry would have its own rules about maintaining the data with respect to the Bitcoin block chain, and because there are so many people who care about such data, the corresponding services would be fairly cheap.

The pegging mechanism involved here is strictly mechanical; there is nothing to manage—it is not based on tweaking parameters in order to induce the market to settle on a particular organic exchange rate.
Concretely, a certain number of tokens of Bitcoin must be 'frozen' to act as a backing for some number of associated tokens in system *Y*; the Bitcoin tokens cannot be used until unfrozen, and no more Bitcoin tokens can be unfrozen than were previously frozen.
Of particular interest is the symmetric case where the exchange rate is *always* 1-to-1; in that case, pegging effectively enables transferring a token from the control of one system, *X*, to the control of another system, *Y*; while the token is being used in one system, the token cannot be used in the other. Effectively, the same token can be used across systems.

Rolling out improvements in propagation will make it safer to increase the block size; thus, it makes sense only to do a hard fork after improvements to networking:
* IBLT/weak-blocks; then a hard fork.
Furthermore, a single hard fork at the end of a sequence could include a cleaner implementation of the already deployed soft-forked features; this alone implies that its best to perform a hard fork after getting SegWit up and running for a sufficiently long period of time to yield better understanding:
* SegWit; then a hard fork.
To give SegWit ample time, it's best to get that out the door as soon as possible, so all effort should be put into SegWit before turning attention to propagation improvements; effectively, SegWit should be deployed first in the sequence:
* SegWit; then IBLT/weak-blocks.
**This, logically, yields the final ordering:**
* **SegWit; then IBLT/weak-blocks; then a hard fork.**
And, as a bonus, the intervening time between now and a hard fork may allow for observing how the Bitcoin ecosystem responds under some kind of maximum load, thereby revealing greater knowledge about how to improve the system.

The practical outcome of this insight, is that the network of Bitcoin nodes is not required to be a repository for all time for whatever data you might want to dump into it.

People sell BTC because it looks like it isn't becoming much more valuable; this starts a downward spiral in the value of BTC.
A falling BTC price means miners don't receive the income they anticipated; the miners start turning off their machines or even filing for bankruptcy. Because miners secure the blockchain, the result is a less secure Bitcoin network, which causes the price of BTC to fall even more; this vicious cycle continues through several iterations.
Once the security of Bitcoin is sufficiently low, the network becomes the target of attacks, which sends the value of BTC even lower. Worse, confidence in Bitcoin evaporates, and so businesses stop using it to process payments.
With nothing but a crumbling ecosystem and a worthless token, disenchanted programmers decide to cut their losses, and move on with their lives.
A few stalwart believers, however, hang tight. They change the underlying algorithms to avoid attacks, and slowly build the new system up even better than before—more robust, more featureful, and more easily improved.

Unfortunately, most software is terrible; wallet software does not escape this fact, which is what Todd points out.
During the BIP&amp;nbsp;66 fiasco, experts were making posts to inform people that they should wait an *extra* 30 confirmations more than they already usually do; even more stupid is the fact that the only way such information could be disseminated was through centralized hubs of information like reddit.
Anyway, the takeaway is this: Forks should be avoided at all costs; given that improvements need to be made, [soft forks should be preferred]( and any hard fork should be rare and introduce a whole bunch of well understood improvements in one go—informed by the experience and data from existing soft forks, etc.
Furthermore, in the long run, Bitcoin should be crystalized and defined as being "complete". Thereafter, all other ideas can be implemented in competing overlays and sidechains; perhaps, it will be possible to set up this Internet of Money to allow any sidechain to become the de&amp;nbsp;facto main chain, allowing the whole system to grow and evolve organically and with as little disruption as possible for any user.

* [Here is a whole submission]( on Adam Back trying to get the Classic 'maintainer' to understand the desired sequence. In particular:
    * **Adam Back:**  


        &gt; 1. 2MB soft-fork;
        &gt; 2. IBLT/weak-blocks;
        &gt; 3. **hard-fork to use space created by 2.**
    * **jtoomim:**  


        &gt; bye
    * **Adam Back:**  


        &gt; if you are too busy then dont maintain classic. if you are maintaining classic do the work.
        &gt; its not a debate. i am explaining the dependency and sequence so you can talk with devs to figure out how to fit it into your differenr release schedule.
        &gt; kind of odd if the lead/only maintainer of classic has to ask devs from core to do any complex work or it wont happen, no?
    Now, why is this particular sequence important? Well, funny you should ask; [here is a whole submission on exactly why](
* From the page on [SegWit benefits](
    &gt; Ultimately **miners will benefit \[from\] a future hardfork** that changes the block capacity limit to be a single weighted sum of parameters. For example:
    &gt;     50*sigops + 4*basedata + 1*witnessdata &lt; 10M
    Do you see that? 10M (as an example); bigger blocks are not off the table.
* From [the Core roadmap](
    &gt; The segwit design calls for a future bitcoinj compatible **hardfork** to further increase its efficiency--but it's not necessary to reap most of the benefits, and that means it can happen on its own schedule and in a non-contentious manner.
    So, a hard fork is planned, and it will include not *just* some measly, worthless, poorly implemented increase in the block-size limit, but *also* other important changes—all in one go.
    Furthermore, from [the FAQ]( there is an entire section devoted to this question:
    &gt; *Segregated witness still sounds complicated. Why not simply raise the maximum block size?*
    &gt; \[&amp;hellip; much explanation &amp;hellip;\]
    &gt; we do expect to make **hard fork*****s*** in the future.
    and:
    &gt; *If there’s eventually going to be a hard fork, why not do it now?*
    &gt; \[&amp;hellip; much explanation &amp;hellip;\]
    &gt; The actual effect of these technologies is unknown, but scaling now with a soft fork that has wide consensus allows us to obtain the immediate gains, test and measure the mid-term possibilities, and use that data to **formulate long-term plans.**
    It's only been recently that it has become clear how to *begin* to proceed in earnest; it took more than a year of investigation for simple facts to become obvious, and it's still not yet clear how a hard fork should take form.
    **Deliberation has continued to produce a superior path forward.**
* [The problem is a hard fork in general]( not just a block-size limit increase in particular.
    Obviously, triggering a hard fork for *anything* will not occur unless it also involves an increase in the block-size limit to at least 2MB; that goes without saying. The exact number to which it should be raised is something worth discussing further, so there is no point other than political masturbation to list a specific number.
    Many people of your ilk have stated that the Lightning Network would require much larger blocks (say, 100MB) to operate on a global scale; assuming that is true, then this implies that the Core devs, who endorse the Lightning Network, must be considering a block-size limit increase at some point in the future.
* In short, [there is a program]( by pushing that program forward, you will make it that much harder for the 'Core devs' to deny you your 'victory'. Get with the program.
    If you want to achieve your goals [amicably], then fit them onto that foundation.

Hence the dispute; you are not convincing anybody on the opposing side.
You want to shift the burden from fees to capacity; there's probably a shift that would be profitable, but we don't know how much to shift, and we aren't yet capable of making the shift smoothly, anyway.
That shift is, in fact, what people are trying to figure out.
The shift involves yet another case of the Tragedy of the Commons; it's unclear how to put a fee on *centralization* (for lack of a more obvious term); it's unclear how to induce the market to allocate its resources in a way that doesn't destroy that which makes Bitcoin actually interesting. Put another way, according to a number of experts, it's *already* the case under the current parameters that the existing Bitcoin system involves worrisome degrees of centralization.
There is contention between scaling and decentralization.
We do **NOT** know how to navigate that contention, a fact which makes the views of your experts more suspect than the views of their opponents.

* Well, a 2 MB hard fork sure as fuck doesn't solve the blocksize 'crisis'.
    At least SegWit sets the foundation for the Lightning Network, the kind of development that appears to be the only viable path towards meaningful scaling. Even without the Lightning Network, any sort of meaningful scaling implies the need to fix transaction malleability.
* Maybe their motives are less pure? [That's insane.]( Note [this comment]( and do some research.
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:20:59
That's irrelevant to the present discussion. What is wrong with you people?
@_date: 2016-01-14 17:12:11
Well, not really.
Strictly speaking, the value of the blockchain is that every piece of data in it can be cryptographically verified; however, the verification of one piece of data requires the verification of every piece of data that came before it in the chain of blocks.
Thus, strictly speaking, you cannot just throw out information; *someone* has to be able to produce a copy of every piece of data in order to make a *complete* verification.
Practically speaking, though, it certainly seems obvious that a pruned history will become canonical, deemed legitimate simply by being widely published and known, thereby allowing the full history to be forgotten... *by most people.*
Yet, it would still be possible for somebody to produce a piece of data (such as a love message) and prove, cryptographically, that said data was inserted in the blockchain at some point.
Perhaps, in general, then, there is a way to shove the onus of storing data onto the people who actually care about that data; frankly, I don't give a shit what your BTC balance is, but I care a lot about being able to prove my own balance (and prove that I've paid you, etc.), so perhaps there is an efficient way to require me to produce for the network the information required to prove my balance, etc., without requiring the network to remember it at all times.

@_date: 2016-01-05 22:42:03
Oh, I should add, that certain elements of the "user interface" need to be fixed. People just don't understand the importance of using a fresh address for each new transaction, and their software doesn't handle it well. Since the beginning, it's been common to paste a static Bitcoin address here or there, but that's terrible for a multitude of reasons.
If something like
* *Stealth Addresses*
* Maxwell's *Donation Addresses*
* Ranvier's *Reusable Payment Codes*
ever become usefully operational, thereby allowing a person to plaster a static address around (but receive payments as though using a dynamic address), then that would go a long way towards building my confidence in the system.
@_date: 2016-01-18 23:33:04
Transaction Malleability destroys the ability to make stable chains of unconfirmed transactions, including chains involving one's own change transactions.
This hobbles usability of Bitcoin right now, because a user must effectively wait for each transaction to become sufficiently confirmed before using it as an input in another transaction, significantly reducing turnaround in spending.
Also, transaction malleability has ramifications that hinder the development of more sophisticated overlay networks such as the Lightning Network, whose hub-and-spoke design currently cannot operate robustly until transaction malleability is fixed.
BIP66 does not fix malleability. It also does not offer the additional capacity improvements offered by SegWit, or the potential to introduce further features that SegWit potentially makes possible.

Not in the least.
* An attack on one chain would affect only the users of that one chain; this isolates a backbone system like Bitcoin from the faults in experimental opt-in sidechain systems.
* As you'll recall from [the comment just above]( there is no *fundamental* reason for such a danger; beyond the peg, the 2 systems can be completely independent.
    In particular, the 2 systems could use completely different proof-of-work algorithms, or one system could be managed by an arbitrarily trustless federation that is fundamentally impervious to hashing attack, or there could be a combination of these modes of security (proof-of-work, with fall-back to a federation). Or, some entirely different system could be dreamed up.
    The peg itself doesn't have to be based on proof-of-work, either; for example, again, an arbitrarily trustless federation could handle it. For more information, [see&amp;nbsp;here](
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:57:27
There's [an entire whitepaper]( on the topic, including a discussion of the security ramifications.
A decentralized 2-way peg can be implemented with a soft fork for Bitcoin; the simplest decentralized 2-way peg leaves Bitcoin ignorant of any particular sidechain, and involves SPV-level security, but another soft fork could make Bitcoin aware of a sidechain that becomes important enough to warrant it.
In the meantime, a federated 2-way peg can already be implemented in Bitcoin as it is today without anybody's permission.
From the whitepaper:

* &gt; The genius idea of Satoshi was when the amount of computational work is asymmetrical then it because possible to asses the chronology of two messages with a very strong statistical certainty (the more PoW difference the more certainty).
    That changes nothing fundamentally.
    If you receive one email with a Hashcash PoW and another email without a Hashcash PoW, then you use that *asymmetry* to quickly choose which one to read first; you *define* the email with PoW to be more sincere, and therefore more worthy of consideration—of&amp;nbsp;course, it could still be junk.
    Again, if you receive one email with a Hashcash PoW and another email with a lesser Hashcash PoW, then you use that *asymmetry* to quickly choose which one to read first; you *define* the email with more PoW to be more sincere, and therefore more worthy of consideration—of&amp;nbsp;course, it could still be junk.
    Again, if you receive one blockchain with a Hashcash PoW and another blockchain with a lesser Hashcash PoW, then you use that *asymmetry* to quickly choose which one to read first; you *define* the blockchain with more PoW to be more sincere, and therefore more worthy of consideration—of&amp;nbsp;course, it could still be junk (maybe it doesn't contain valid data).
    The asymmetry in Bitcoin comes from the fact that PoW is exponentially compounded by virtue of the Merkle tree; that is, the asymmetry is provided by the git history of commits, where each commit has been submitted with a Hashcash PoW. This creates useful asymmetry very quickly, but is ***not*** fundamentally different from spam control.
    All the pieces of Bitcoin were already well-understood (I mean, it's split-piece transactional structure is arguably hundreds of years old); what people didn't realize is that *spam&amp;nbsp;control* is a great way to think about maintaining an honest record, and that insight is what Satoshi provided.
* &gt; Have a read to his twitter page: 
    &gt;&gt; cryptographer, privacy enhancing tech, ecash, inventor of hashcash (bitcoin is hashcash extended with inflation control)
    &gt; Pretty much saying that he invented Bitcoin!
    &gt; (BTW a PoW with inflation control.. if it was so easy why don't he came up with when he invented hashcash??)
    I choose to interpret that as 'Bitcoin uses Hashcash extended with inflation control'.
    It was well understood that Hashcash's flaw is that computers and computer networks become more powerful, such that it becomes easier for spammers to forge what appears to be meaningful proof of work; this is particularly the case, because emails aren't typically part of long chains with compounded proof of work.
    Because the decentralized email system doesn't operate in a peer-to-peer network designed to consolidate information about the difficulty of producing a proof of work, there is no clear way to agree upon what that difficulty should be, so it is simply left to each email server to choose its own configuration.
    Bitcoin's very purpose as a peer-to-peer network that maintains a single record allows for it to collate the data necessary to choose a single difficulty dynamically. It's a much easier problem for a system like Bitcoin to solve.

You could already do that with the existing system, so nothing has really changed, except that it has been made easier for the sake of being able to consolidate transaction and/or alter fees, both of which are very valuable.
If someone who runs a node does not like the change, he is free to reverse the change in his own node—this isn't a protocol change; it's a change in convention only.

    In any case, these bandwidth considerations are one of the reasons [why it's important]( to role out network improvements *before* any hard fork that increases the block size limit.
* Price discovery in the fee market will hopefully reduce the number of transactions that need to be re-submitted; RBF is a fantastic tool for price discovery.
    That is, Bitcoin has tools to handle this situation; if those tools don't work very well, then Bitcoin has no hope, anyway.

Given a piece of information, Bitcoin allows you to calculate the probability that said piece of information was processed into what is likely the final record.
* Yet, who is to give you that piece of information to test in the first place? There's no reason for the Core of the system to care about it; the Core of the system need only maintain just enough structure (some subset of the Merkle tree, etc.) to make a relevant calculation of sufficient probability.
    The sufficiency of that probability is *subjective*, which opens it up to market forces; that's why it will probably become a market unto itself—if you want greater certainty (say, from an archival node), you might have to pay more for it.
* If, regardless of whether I know exactly what your marriage proposal was, I can prove with *near* certainty to anyone else that I own the coins I say I own, then I don't give a damn what your marriage proposal was—it's of no consequence to my purposes. For all I care, the entire network can forget your marriage proposal.
    One of the reasons for running your own node is that you get to choose what information is important.

Now, all we have to do is make BTC a common medium of exchange between those systems via the 2-way peg mechanism that Blockstream has described in its [Sidechains&amp;nbsp;Whitepaper](
**We can make Bitcoin the inevitable backbone of an Internet of Money.**
The whitepaper mentions several ways that a 2-way peg can be constructed, and concentrates on a particular one, due to its relative simplicity to model, scale, and deploy:
* **the Symmetric SPV-proof 2-way Peg**
This method allows for arbitrarily strong security; if you want to improve *exponentially* the probability that a transfer is valid, just wait a little longer. This is similar to how normal SPV Bitcoin clients work, but the paper notes that further additional information can be included with the transfer in order to make that process even more robust, but that's just a detail.
In any case, it is not envisioned that 2-way pegs be used regularly or for small transfers, both because trusting the validity requires waiting a not-insignificant amount of time (perhaps a few days) and because the SPV-proofs are not-insignificant in size (though the whitepaper describes a pretty interesting way to make them quite compact).
Instead, it is intended that large transfers be made, and then people on both sides of the peg can simply trade their coins nearly instantly using an already well-established, robust, trustless method that works *today* across blockchain systems that are not even pegged:
* **the Atomic Swap** (which is also described in the paper).
What makes the atomic swap even more useful for pegged blockchains than for non-pegged blockchains is that there is no volatility in price (because the tokens are pegged), which greatly simplifies the market for (*i.e.,* the organizing of) swaps.
Now, how does a blockchain system check an SPV proof? Well, a new system created specifically to be a sidechain certainly can be programmed from the start to understand them, but what about Bitcoin, which was designed before the concept of an SPV proof was even developed? There are 2 approaches:
* If (or when) Bitcoin's script language is finally made just slightly more powerful (perhaps even as powerful as it was when Satoshi first released it), then it will be possible to describe the validation process using just Bitcoin's script; that is to say, if the Bitcoin world ever wants even slightly smart contracts, then that implies the Bitcoin world wants to allow for the permissionless creation of symmetric SPV-proof 2-way pegs.
    Such improvements to Bitcoin's script can be introduced with a soft fork.
* Because 2-way pegs are awesome, and are clearly the future of the Internet of Money, it would be silly to require the overhead inherent in describing them with generic Bitcoin script primitives; instead, it makes a lot more sense to build that description directly into Bitcoin by creating a script primitive dedicated to SPV-proof validation.
    Such augmentation to Bitcoin's script can be introduced with a soft fork.
Of course, a soft fork is not quite permissionless to deploy; it requires significant approval from the Bitcoin world, and it's difficult to get that approval unless the correctness of a plan can be demonstrated. Yet, how can there be such a demonstration unless there are implemented sidechains with which real-world value can be experimented? Simple:
* **the Federated Peg**
The insight here is that any missing functionality in Bitcoin's script processing can already be provided permissionlessly by a third party, *and* that this third party need not be particularly trusted. The paper thus describes what is called a federated peg, which not only can provide arbitrarily distributed trust, but also allows for users in the Bitcoin world to send and receive transactions from others without even realizing that the coins are making their way through a 2-way peg! (It merely appears that coins are being sent through a multisignature address.)
The federated peg is actually suited to private blockchains that are interesting to a consortium of mutually distrusting organizations (*e.g.,* banks). It's also an excellent way to bootstrap and maintain a minimum degree of security for a sidechain that is ultimately meant to transition to a symmetric SPV-proof 2-way peg in the long term.
Hence, using the federated peg will allow for a nascent Internet of Money to begin to develop, proving the worth of sidechains.
**tl;dr:** A 2-way peg can be made arbitrarily secure, can be deployed permissionlessly already, and won't even be an issue for everyday use between \[important\] sidechains, anyway.

* &gt; Well you seem to say that only 0conf are not "stable".
    No, I do not; nowhere do I say that or even imply that. I mean... [*look at what I say*](
    &gt;&gt; The deeper a transaction gets buried in the blockchain (by being included in a block and then having future blocks built on top of that block), the more likely it is to be true; a transaction with zero confirmations has a low probability of being true—even worse, there's no obvious way to calculate what the probability is.
* &gt; The truth is not that black and white,
    That's the whole point of Bitcoin; it defines truth as a probability.
    What makes 0-conf so extra horrible is that besides having a low probability of truth, *there is no obvious way to calculate that probability*.
    In contrast, once a transaction is included in the blockchain, the probabilities become much more manageable.
    Of course, this opens up territory for different transaction models around the 0-conf level; the lightning network is one model for dealing with those; a centralized intra-service payment system like ChangeTip is another model; etc.

    In contrast, the block size limit is part of the protocol, and it can only be changed by hard fork (or avoided by transferring BTC to a sidechain).
* I suppose your point here is that if you can pay for it, then your transaction is not spam; however, it's not clear what the costs of a transaction are, given that the transaction must essentially be stored for all time in order for it to be possible to verify the blockchain for all time.
    The cost of a transaction is a lot more complicated than just considering the transaction fee.

Yes. Bitcoin establishes [abstractions and protocols]( so that it's possible to establish the truth of a statement with rapidly increasing probability.
The more blocks under which a transaction gets buried, the exponentially higher the probability that it will remain in the record for all time; that probability rapidly *approaches* 1, but never quite gets there, even when a particular block (like perhaps a genesis block) is hard-coded into the software (hey, a hard fork that changes that value is always possible, however remote).

I'm bearish on the community; Bitcoin became big far too early, the result being that it's difficult to improve the system—not only are improvements technically unwieldy, but they also require wearisome public relations campaigns to cut through the inertia of the common man's militant idiocy.
So, what I'm waiting for is proof that the Geniuses can push forward their ideas in ways that don't require permission from the useless masses; we're *starting* to see that happen, what with transaction malleability getting fixed via SegWit, the developing of overlay networks like the Lightning Network, and the possibility of transferring BTC tokens to alternative systems via 2-way pegs (sidechains and extension blocks).
* Transaction Malleability is actually a humongous problem that nobody seems to appreciate; I mean, all the discussion about SegWit has to do with whether or not it effectively scales the block size, which is *completely irrelevant*. When SegWit becomes fully operational and provably useful, then I'll consider that a sign to make a big entrance into this space.
* If something like the Lightning Network comes to fruition, then I will go in even bigger.
* When sidechains and the like become operational and provably useful, then I will go *all&amp;nbsp;in*, because that means my BTC can be transferred to whatever system that follows, thereby making my BTC futureproof, guaranteeing its usefulness to future societal organization.

Recall that SPV clients use just enough structural information about the blockchain to prove within reasonable trustlessness that some transaction was included in the complete blockchain.
I suspect that a variation of this method will be extended to the rest of the network such that the onus of storing any particular piece of the blockchain could be pushed onto the people who actually care about being able to prove said piece is part of the complete blockchain.
In this way, the network can largely forget the blockchain, but still fully process requests from those people.
**Concretely:** If you stuff your coins into the cryptographic equivalent of a buried shoebox for half a century, then there should be no reasonable expectation that the network at large will bother to keep the necessary information at the ready just in case you decide to dig them up; you'd better be ready to provide the details yourself, or wait for some archival tier of the network to handle your request.

If you knew anything about how the source code is managed, you'd realize how impossible your statement is.
Every little change of the source code (going back very many years) is stored, and replicated across the Internet, and any one of those versions can be picked up at any time by *anybody* else, and continued.
Furthermore, due to the cryptographic nature in which the source code is stored (in a way much like that of Bitcoin's own blockchain), it's virtually impossible to quietly alter any particular version, or to create new versions that are not at least open to public scrutiny.
In short, your statement just makes absolutely no sense.

* Firstly, that's not entirely what I was arguing. [As pointed out here](
    &gt; That's irrelevant. Just as neither LN nor SegWit exist, so it is with a block size greater than 1MB; you cannot hold non-existence against SegWit but then ignore non-existence with respect to a hard fork.
* Secondly, I covered that rebuttal [here](
    &gt; Now, a protocol improvement like SegWit will potentially tax the network with greater throughput, so it could be argued that networking improvements should be deployed before SegWit:
    &gt; * networking improvements; then protocol improvements; then a hard fork.
    &gt; However, tuning the parameters of networking improvements such as IBLT/weak-blocks/thin-blocks implementations is still a matter of ongoing research, whereas SegWit is nearly ready to go; furthermore, it is useful to give SegWit ample time to deploy, so as to get real-world feedback.
    &gt; Thus, Bitcoin Core devs have decided it's best to get SegWit out the door as soon as possible; all of their effort has been put into SegWit before turning much attention to networking improvements, especially since SegWit will provide a much-desired increase in throughput and  may influence the implementation of networking improvements; effectively, Bitcoin Core has decided *internally* on the following order:
    &gt; * protocol improvements; then networking improvements; then a hard fork.
    &gt; Yet, such an order is not necessarily known to be strictly required; other groups could pick up the slack with the effort to improve networking at the same time.
    &gt; **This yields the final, logical ordering:**

The size of the blocks is irrelevant to the message:
The ***Core*** of the Bitcoin ecosystem must ultimately become crystallized, stable, and unlikely to change, with all innovation moved to overlays and sidechains that are connected in an Internet of Money in which BTC is the common medium of exchange.
In this way, perhaps it could be set up so that one of these sidechains might itself become the de&amp;nbsp;facto core, allowing the ecosystem to grow and evolve organically with as little disruption and imposition for users as possible.
**That is the vision of sound money.** That is why it is called 'Bitcoin *Core*'.
You can build a cheap, high-volume layer on top of a decentralized layer of any sort, but you cannot build a decentralized layer on top of a centralized layer of any sort. The core must be correct.
When this whole conflict erupted, nobody even knew, e.g., that Segregated Witness could be implemented as a soft fork, let alone bring the extra benefit of increased capacity. And, don't forget that SegWit fixes a longstanding issue that must be fixed for Bitcoin to be scaled meaningfully, anyway.

* [Greg Maxwell in his email that set the foundation for the Core scaling roadmap](
    &gt; Going beyond segwit, there has been some considerable activity brewing around more efficient block relay.  There is a collection of proposals, some stemming from a p2pool-inspired informal sketch of mine and some independently invented, called "weak blocks", "**thin&amp;nbsp;blocks**" or "soft blocks".  These proposals build on top of efficient relay techniques (like the relay network protocol or IBLT) and move virtually all the transmission time of a block to before the block is found, eliminating size from the orphan race calculation. We already desperately need this at the current block sizes. These have not yet been implemented, but fortunately the path appears clear. I've seen at least one more or less complete specification, and I expect to see things running using this in a few months. This tool will remove propagation latency from being a problem in the absence of strategic behavior by miners.  Better understanding **their behavior when miners behave strategically is an open question.**
* This sort of thing is mentioned further in the [capacity scaling FAQ](
    &gt; *Weak blocks and IBLTs just say “2016” in the roadmap schedule. Does this mean you have no idea when they’ll be available?*
    &gt; [Weak blocks and IBLTs]( are two separate technologies that are still being [actively studied]( to choose the right parameters, but the number of developers working on them is limited and so it’s difficult to guess when they’ll be deployed.
    &gt; Weak blocks and IBLTs can both be deployed as network-only enhancements (no soft or hard fork required) which means that there will probably only be a short time from when testing is completed to when their benefits are available to all upgraded nodes. We hope this will happen within 2016.
    &gt; After deployment, both weak blocks and IBLTs may benefit from a simple non-controversial soft fork ([canonical transaction ordering]( which should be easy to deploy using the [BIP9]( versionBits system described elsewhere in this FAQ.

A transaction already flies around to people at the speed of the Internet (like an email), but that's not what matters; what matters is the Bitcoin Network's *confirmation* of those transactions—what matters are the *blocks* that miners produce during the Proof of Work algorithm.
The deeper a transaction gets buried in the blockchain (by being included in a block and then having future blocks built on top of that block), the more likely it is to be true; a transaction with zero confirmations has a low probability of being true—even worse, there's no obvious way to calculate what the probability is.
Right now, people are relying on the *convention* of nodes in the Bitcoin network to throw away double spends, but there's nothing stopping a node from relaying a double spend if he so chooses, and there's nothing stopping a miner from mining that double spend if he so chooses.
The whole point of Bitcoin is to escape convention by instead using Proof of Work. Bitcoin makes few practical guarantees about 0-conf transactions.

**Cold, gray, heartless, trustless Core**—*just as it should be!*
The transactions of the world are not uniform in their requirements; there are various profiles of risk and cost and speed and payload—*and any other property you can think of!* Indeed, there is more trust in the world than Bitcoin assumes, and that trust can be used by some profiles in order to benefit everyone.
No single system can simultaneously cater to all profiles.
The profile that Bitcoin was designed to serve entails decentralized, trustless processing of "small casual transactions"—and of these properties, decentralization is paramount; after all, you can construct an inexpensive high-volume transaction system on top of a decentralized core system of nearly any sort, but you cannot construct a decentralized system on top of a centralized core system of any sort.
The *Core* of the ecosystem has to be correct.
Above all else, the *Core* of the Bitcoin ecosystem must provide decentralized, trustless processing of transactions; once that goal has been met, an overlay network (like the Lightning Network) can be used to construct Bitcoin transactions in a way that is smarter than simply using Bitcoin directly. Furthermore, Bitcoin's token, BTC, can be [pegged]( to the tokens of other systems that cater to all manner of different profiles.
In this way, every possible profile can be serviced and yet tied together with a common token, BTC; when there is doubt in the ecosystem, users can retreat to the safety of the cold, heartless, trustlesss core that is Bitcoin.

The beauty of a well-designed system is that it doesn't make unnecessary assumptions.
It will be perfectly possible for some group of nodes, for instance, to retain (as a service) *all* information *ever* submitted to the network for processing, because no assumption is made that conflicts with that possibility.
Similarly, getting rid of unnecessary assumptions is the reason for \[re-\]introducing RBF (it was an original feature, but badly designed).

Given one token-based system, *X*, it is possible to create another token-based system, *Y*, whose token is pegged to the token of system *X*. There are 3 components here:
* System *X*.
* System *Y*.
* [A pegging mechanism](
In the case of sidechains, systems *X* and *Y* are intended to be blockchain-based. Indeed, Bitcoin could function as system *X* here; however, system *Y* need not be a blockchain-based system at&amp;nbsp;all; of course, if it is, then that makes it possible to construct and then submit a PoW-based proof to system *X* as part of a pegging mechanism, and vice&amp;nbsp;versa.
Long story short, Bitcoin's blockchain has nearly nothing to do with sidechains beyond the pegging mechanism; beyond the pegging mechanism, they are completely independent systems.
One thing that's nice about pegging the tokens, though, will be that it eliminates the need to calculate a spot price, making the already existing method of performing atomic swaps that much easier to organize.

I don't think that's a sufficient definition for "digital".
In engineering, an analog signal is rendered digital because it is interpreted according to abstractions and protocols which reduce (if not virtually eliminate) noise in that signal.
Just because the banking system manages its data with computers doesn't mean that the 'signal' it's producing is sufficiently protected from 'noise'; that's why there's all manner of baroque infrastructure in place to maintain the purity of its signal.
Bitcoin sets up new abstractions and protocols which significantly reduce (if not virtually eliminate) that noise, which is why it deserves the qualification 'digital'.

Just as the probability of a transaction's truth increases the longer that the transaction is in the blockchain, the probability of a blockchain's truth increases the more of it you verify.
Surely, there is some subset of the blockchain (perhaps coupled with other data, such as historic difficulty levels) that, if verified, means it's highly likely to offer the correct tip of the chain (or, more generally, highly likely to offer enough cryptographic structure with which to verify that some other set of data was in fact placed in the desired blockchain).
In particular, maybe the onus of storing any particular piece of the blockchain could be pushed onto the people who actually care about being able to prove said piece is part of the complete blockchain. In this way, the network can largely forget the blockchain, but still fully process requests from those people.

Telling 10% of users that they can go fuck themselves is not my idea of suitable operation for a supposedly decentralized system of sound money.
Now, in these early days, that kind of tumult may be necessary to hoist the system into its proper long-term form; however, merely achieving a 2MB block is clearly not sufficient to be classified in that category of alteration.
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:48:29
[There could be]( there's no requirement to advertise them.
Certainly, Blockstream is running sidechains.
@_date: 2016-01-28 00:12:23
Given one token-based system, *X*, it is possible to create another token-based system, *Y*, whose token is pegged to the token of system *X*. There are 3 components here:
* System *X*.
* System *Y*.
* A pegging mechanism.
The [Sidechains&amp;nbsp;Whitepaper]( mentions several methods by which a 2-way peg can be constructed, and concentrates on a particular one, due to its relative simplicity to model, scale, and deploy:
* **the Symmetric SPV-proof 2-way Peg**
This method allows for arbitrarily strong security; if you want to improve *exponentially* the probability that a transfer is valid, just wait a little longer. This is similar to how normal SPV Bitcoin clients work, but the paper notes that further additional information can be included with the transfer in order to make that process even more robust, but that's just a detail.
In any case, it is not envisioned that 2-way pegs be used regularly or for small transfers, both because trusting the validity requires waiting a not-insignificant amount of time (perhaps a few days) and because the SPV-proofs are not-insignificant in size (though the whitepaper describes a pretty interesting way to make them quite compact).
Instead, it is intended that large transfers be made, and then people on both sides of the peg can simply trade their coins nearly instantly using an already well-established, robust, trustless method that works *today* across blockchain systems that are not even pegged:
* **the Atomic Swap** (which is also described in the paper).
What makes the atomic swap even more useful for pegged blockchains than for non-pegged blockchains is that there is no volatility in price (because the tokens are pegged), which greatly simplifies the market for (*i.e.,* the organizing of) swaps.
Now, how does a blockchain system check an SPV proof? Well, a new system created specifically to be a sidechain certainly can be programmed from the start to understand them, but what about Bitcoin, which was designed before the concept of an SPV proof was even developed? There are 2 approaches:
* If (or when) Bitcoin's script language is finally made just slightly more powerful (perhaps even as powerful as it was when Satoshi first released it), then it will be possible to describe the validation process using just Bitcoin's script; that is to say, if the Bitcoin world ever wants even slightly smart contracts, then that implies the Bitcoin world wants to allow for the permissionless creation of symmetric SPV-proof 2-way pegs.
    Such improvements to Bitcoin's script can be introduced with a soft fork.
* Because 2-way pegs are awesome, and are clearly the future of the Internet of Money, it would be silly to require the overhead inherent in describing them with generic Bitcoin script primitives; instead, it makes a lot more sense to build that description directly into Bitcoin by creating a script primitive dedicated to SPV-proof validation.
    Such augmentation to Bitcoin's script can be introduced with a soft fork.
Of course, a soft fork is not quite permissionless to deploy; it requires significant approval from the Bitcoin world, and it's difficult to get that approval unless the correctness of a plan can be demonstrated. Yet, how can there be such a demonstration unless there are implemented sidechains with which real-world value can be experimented? Simple:
* **the Federated Peg**
The insight here is that any missing functionality in Bitcoin's script processing can already be provided permissionlessly by a third party, *and* that this third party need not be particularly trusted. The paper thus describes what is called a federated peg, which not only can provide arbitrarily distributed trust, but also allows for users in the Bitcoin world to send and receive transactions from others without even realizing that the coins are making their way through a 2-way peg! (It merely appears that coins are being sent through a multisignature address.)
The federated peg is actually suited to private blockchains that are interesting to a consortium of mutually distrusting organizations (*e.g.,* banks). It's also an excellent way to bootstrap and maintain a minimum degree of security for a sidechain that is ultimately meant to transition to a symmetric SPV-proof 2-way peg in the long term.
Hence, using the federated peg will allow for a nascent Internet of Money to begin to develop, proving the worth of sidechains.
**tl;dr:** A 2-way peg can be made arbitrarily secure, can be deployed permissionlessly already, and won't even be an issue for everyday use between \[important\] sidechains, anyway.

    Fortunately, RBF (an original feature that had been removed because of a fault that allowed a DoS attack) will be helpful in allowing users to express how much they value getting into the next block.
* Also, the goal of Bitcoin isn't to protect businesses from bad business decisions; the goal of Bitcoin is to protect users from counter-party risk and third-party special-interest interference. People know how Bitcoin functions and can see how it is functioning, including when it reaches max load.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:56:46
Well, sort of.
Private blockchains can and will be tied to Bitcoin via 2-way pegs, making BTC an extremely valuable common medium of exchange amongst all the private systems that wish to be so connected.
This will make Bitcoin the backbone of an Internet of Money. That is the vision of sound money; that is why it is called 'Bitcoin *Core*'.
@_date: 2016-01-19 01:31:10
Terrible idea. Just terrible.
He's re-hashing the notion that the market should, in some way, reveal the desired fork in a hard fork by bidding on their respective tokens either directly or through some kind of prediction market.
A better solution is to allow each user to transfer control of his tokens from one system (say, Bitcoin Core) to another system (say, Bitcoin classic), *and back again, if desired.* Allowing the user to choose his desired system of rules allows for the market to discover the correct solutions without forcing everyone to participate in speculation.
This is precisely why the ***Core*** of the Bitcoin ecosystem must ultimately become crystallized, stable, and unlikely to change, with all innovation moved to overlays and sidechains that are connected in an Internet of Money in which BTC is the common medium of exchange.
In this way, perhaps it could be set up so that one of these sidechains might itself become the de&amp;nbsp;facto core, allowing the ecosystem to grow and evolve organically with as little disruption and imposition for users as possible.
**That is the vision of sound money.** That is why it is called 'Bitcoin *Core*'.
You can build a cheap, high-volume layer on top of a decentralized layer of any sort, but you cannot build a decentralized layer on top of a centralized layer of any sort. The core must be correct.

Scholars have never considered the U.S. Constitution to be the source of rights; rather, it is merely supposed to identify \[at least some of those\] rights which surely exist already, and explicitly forbid the government from trespassing on those rights.
He's saying the Constitution should explicitly restrict the government from imposing one currency on the people.
And, you know what? It already does.
The Constitution is a restriction on the *government*, not the people, and the Constitution restricts the *government* to Gold and Silver.
Unfortunately, the government has wiggled its way out of that restriction by re-interpreting the terms; it is this kind of obviously slimy re-interpretation that Lindsey is denigrating—to him, that is not what it means for the Constitution to be a 'living and breathing document'; to him, a 'living and breathing' document is simply one that can be amended as per the existing processes: If the government wanted to get around the restriction that it use Gold and Silver, then it should have explicitly altered the text rather than use unelected bureaucrats to re-interpret the existing text.

So, either *you* don't understand what I'm saying, or you wish not to acknowledge what I'm saying.
Let me put it another way: There is *no* such thing as a complete record; indeed, each block in the blockchain simply has assigned to it a probability regarding whether that block will be part of the record—the genesis block has the highest probability of being part of that record, and the latest tip of the blockchain has the lowest probability of all the blocks, and a transaction that has not yet made it into a block has an even lower (and much more difficult to determine) probability.

When these people say 'Blockchain', what they mean is 'Using a Merkle tree to store a cryptographically auditable history'.
These bankers have discovered source code management; they've realized that they can start managing their vast amount of data the same way that programmers have done so for the last decade: `git`.
The 'blockchain', as they call it, is just a version of the `git` source code management tool that has been specialized for their domain of expertise. It provides a standard way for multiple institutions to work together on a common record of history. That's it.
The 'Blockchain' without BTC *is* useful to them.
That being said, an inevitable disruption in their sector, though, will ultimately be Bitcoin; Blockstream's goal is to create an Internet of Money with Bitcoin as the backbone, where BTC serves as the valuable common medium of exchange between all manner of blockchain systems (both private and otherwise).

* When a soft fork triggers, there is a not-insignificant amount of hashing power behind the old, minority rules; this is especially the case when miners are not actually validating the blocks on which they build, meaning that even the miners that are supposed to be working on the new rules are actually working on the old rules at the same time (idiots).
    So, a client that does not know about the new rules may be fooled into following a not-insignificantly long chain of doomed minority blocks.
* Also, the new majority rules have less consolidated hashing power behind them than before; this means there is reduced security for it as well, though that's probably insignificant.

* Improvements to efficiency in transmitting, storing, and validating data will allow more nodes to participate fully; this enhances decentralization *and* makes an increase in block sizes much more palatable.

That being said, RBF is useful if only because it makes Bitcoin's *existing* guarantee clear and explicit: Only that which appears in the blockchain can be considered truth, and that truth is a probability that approaches closer to 1 with each new confirmation; it is *wrongheaded* to trust in the ephemeral convention of nodes, rather than proof of work.

Terrible idea. Just terrible.
He's re-hashing the notion that the market should, in some way, reveal the desired fork in a hard fork by bidding on their respective tokens either directly or through some kind of prediction market.
A better solution is to allow each user to transfer control of his tokens from one system (say, Bitcoin Core) to another system (say, Bitcoin classic), *and back again, if desired.* Allowing the user to choose his desired system of rules allows for the market to discover the correct solutions without forcing everyone to participate in speculation.
This is precisely why the ***Core*** of the Bitcoin ecosystem must ultimately become crystallized, stable, and unlikely to change, with all innovation moved to overlays and sidechains that are connected in an Internet of Money in which BTC is the common medium of exchange.
In this way, perhaps it could be set up so that one of these sidechains might itself become the de&amp;nbsp;facto core, allowing the ecosystem to grow and evolve organically with as little disruption and imposition for users as possible.
**That is the vision of sound money.** That is why it is called 'Bitcoin *Core*'.

Bitcoin *may* solve the Byzantine Generals' Problem, a possibility that seems to me to be fairly irrelevant in this discussion; at the very least, anyway, it seems unlikely that Satoshi had that problem in mind, as he makes no mention of it in his seminal paper.
Instead, Satoshi describes a very simple timeserver similar to a git history of commits, and then proceeds to state matter-of-factly that 'distributing' (really, 'decentralizing') control of this history requires a proof-of-work algorithm like Hashcash:






That is, you have to be serious about the timestamp you submit; it becomes uneconomical to spam everyone with useless timestamps—the only way you'll be able to afford to submit a timestamp is if you're performing a service for which someone is paying sincerely.

Whether or not other people store the love message is irrelevant, because it will be possible to show that the love message in question was inserted into the blockchain at some point (by looking at what I presume you are calling the "abstract values", and calculating how the love message fits into them).
Indeed, the only way to verify that your "abstract values" are correct is to have all the data from which those values were derived (e.g., the love message).
For the most part, though, I agree that some widely published set of "abstract values" (a pruned blockchain) will become the working blockchain for most people, but that doesn't negate the fact that the messages from which that working blockchain was derived are still intimately associated with that working blockchain.

Furthermore, I *suspect* that a sidechain could be set up to replace its mainchain nearly seamlessly.
Triggered by the fulfillment of criteria whose satisfaction virtually guarantees a smooth transition, the sidechain begins taking on the responsibilities hitherto delegated to the mainchain (*e.g.,* minting tokens, etc.), and thereby pinches itself off from the mainchain to become, in effect, the new mainchain.
In this way, even the core of a complex ecosystem of sidechains could be improved without forcing \[nearly\] anyone to comply with some experimental alteration that is untested in the real world; the core could evolve according to the organic, objective, measurable, voluntary choices of its users.
@_date: 2016-01-22 22:00:20
That would be a problem with that particular sidechain; that sidechain chooses the rules of its own game, and it's up to the users of a sidechain to determine whether they want to play that game or not.
That is, just as you wished, the experimentation is isolated to those who willingly participate.
To be clear, Bitcoin would not be affected; there's no way to create BTC in this way, if that's what you're thinking. The losers would be the users of the sidechain.
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:08:10
Yes, they do exist. There could be any number of sidechains running right now, using a relatively trustless 2-way peg mechanism called "the federated peg"—certainly, Blockstream is running them.
A soft fork to allow Bitcoin to support even slightly smarter contracts than it already supports will also allow a more decentralized 2-way peg based on Proof of Work; in fact, all it takes is a soft fork to support such a 2-way peg directly.
Then, besides a 2-way peg, it's already possible to make atomic swaps between blockchain systems.

**tl;dr: You are off \[almost\] completely.**
The Bitcoin network establishes a difficulty for the mining process.
If more miners show up, then the network can find a block more quickly, and thereby process a higher rate of transactions.
However, soon thereafter, the network adjusts the mining process to make it even more difficult, which cancels out the gains provided by the new miners and thereby reduces the transaction throughput back to what it was.
So, no. It won't help.
Moreover, an increase in the rate at which blocks are found would do very to little increase throughput, anyway. It could also represent a reduction in security for the network, and it would entail a larger load on the network's banwidth and storage.

It's 'CPFP'. Why do people just write *whatever* without thinking?
Fortunately, you can have both.
* [According to the FAQ on RBF](
    &gt; **What is “Child pays for parent” (CPFP)?**
    &gt; Child pays for parent is a way of adding fees to a transaction by making an another transaction that depends on the first.
    &gt; **Why wasn’t CPFP used for RBF?**
    &gt; Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) doesn’t solve the same problem. RBF allows the *spender* to increase fees; CPFP is useful because it allows the *recipient* to increase fees.
    &gt; RBF has the advantage over CPFP that it doesn’t necessarily require using any extra block space, so it’s more efficient by about [30% to 90%](
    &gt; The plan is to support both CPFP and opt-in RBF.
* [and this](
    &gt; **What if I think that RBF is just awful?**
    &gt; Then don’t use it: don’t set it on your own transactions and treat transactions you receive with all sequence numbers less than MAX_INT-1 as non-existing (or already double-spent) until they confirm. Opt-in RBF is opt-in.
    &gt; No commonly used software that we’re aware of sets its sequence numbers to below MAX_INT-1, and many programs (including “transaction confidence” meters) already regard low sequence numbers as potentially double spendable. After all, the transaction has been explicitly marked as replaceable, and even without RBF, nLocktime may result in a conflict getting confirmed first.
    &gt; If someone sends you a replaceable transaction and you won’t zero-conf credit it, their replacement can make it get confirmed as fast as they want it to get confirmed. The same sorts of situations exist already for senders using non-standard transaction features or spending unconfirmed outputs, which makes transactions objectively more double spendable—but in those cases there is no fix to get the transaction through quickly.
    &gt; RBF is a feature for consenting adults. If you don’t want to participate in it, you don’t need to. Your dislike of it isn’t a reason to prevent others from using it in transactions that don’t involve you.

I suppose that's theoretically true, but not practically true.

I don't give a shit whether you can prove your balance; I do care about whether I can prove *my* balance.

Well, when these people say 'Blockchain', what they mean is 'Using a Merkle tree to store a cryptographically auditable history'.
People involved in Big Data (*e.g.,* bankers) have discovered source code management; they've realized that they can start managing their vast amount of data the same way that programmers have done so for the last decade: `git`.
The 'Blockchain', as they call it, is just a version of the `git` source code management tool that has been specialized for their domain of expertise. It provides a standard way for multiple institutions to work together on a common record of history. That's it.
The 'Blockchain' without BTC *is* useful to them.
That being said, an inevitable disruption in their sector, though, will ultimately be Bitcoin; Blockstream's goal is to create an [Internet&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Money]( with Bitcoin as the backbone, where BTC serves as the valuable common medium of exchange between all manner of blockchain systems (both private and otherwise).

**For the Love of Satoshi, *Quit* trying to build the ecosystem on a foundation of sand.**


The whole point of Bitcoin is that it provides a rigorous definition of risk—*but only for blocks!*
When the Bitcoin network begins producing confirmations of a transaction, that's when the transaction has 'manageable&amp;nbsp;risk', *and not a moment before!*
It is not possible to apply the term 'manageable&amp;nbsp;risk' to a transaction that—*by&amp;nbsp;definition*—exists outside the scope of 'manageable&amp;nbsp;risk'.
Zero confirmation means the Bitcoin network has not given the okay, *and may never do so*. It is what it is; stop trying to make it more than it is.
Your only hope is a higher-level protocol that *simulates* instant confirmation by largely taking care of confirmation in advance (e.g., the Lightning Network, or some centralized network, etc.).

* Part of the confusion is that 'Bitcoin' is not the same as 'bitcoin'.
    The term 'Bitcoin' refers to the system (and to the realized, functioning implementation of that system), while the term 'bitcoin' refers to the unit of account in that system, also known as 'BTC' (among other names).
    That's why I explicitly chose to frame this discussion in terms of 'BTC' (and 'the existing Bitcoin system'); that's why I explicitly wrote:
    &gt; Whether or not you call the whole functioning ecosystem 'Bitcoin'&amp;hellip;
    On the Lightning Network, you are still passing around real Bitcoin-system transactions, it's just that they are being formulated according to a more sophisticated protocol that takes care of settlement in advance and thereby simulates instant confirmation at the point of trade.
    That is to say, the Lightning Network is the solution for which you are looking: It provides a peer-to-peer transmission of BTC transactions and makes BTC work like cash.
* As an aside, I would note that while a Bitcoin-system transaction flies around peer-to-peer at the speed of the Internet (just like an email), that is not the case of confirmation; there *is* a third&amp;nbsp;party in the Bitcoin system, and that third&amp;nbsp;party is the Bitcoin network, which must produce a confirmation of the peer-to-peer transaction—it's just that this third&amp;nbsp;party is designed to be decentralized.

The Internet of Money seems to provide what you want:
* One system would provide the simplicity you desire, and thereby act as the *core* or kernel of the ecosystem.
* The web of other systems would provide all of the complexity; yet, each system would be simple in the context of its particular domain.
* When there is doubt anywhere within the ecosystem, users could escape to another part of the ecosystem—perhaps all the way back to the nearly unchanging, nearly immutable, nearly sacred core.
    By variation and selection, some other system might become the de&amp;nbsp;facto core, so there is room for evolution.
A simple system based on the least assumptions can be rock solid, but is probably too pedantic to be useful for many applications.
For instance, there is a lot more trust in the world than Bitcoin assumes, and that trust can be put to productive use so that everyone profits handsomely—the cold, harsh, unforgiving, heartless nature of Bitcoin is not too useful between the local barista and his regular face-to-face customers; indeed, Bitcoin's willful ignorance of the social relationship becomes an overhead.
So, if you want your simplicity of implementation, you can have it—but only in the *core* of the ecosystem; you must defer the complexity to some other domain-specific system.
In this way, the adventurous can sneak out of the core, and travel to all manner of interesting portions of the ecosystem, and then retreat as necessary to the safety of the core.

* Well, I don't think we're quite disagreeing.
    I'm not suggesting that you should give up your ability to sync from the genesis block—if you and others want to put the resources into maintaining that ability, that's your business.
    However, I suspect that a great many other people's business doesn't require that ability, and they won't care to help you maintain your expectation.
* In any case, consider that your trust in the genesis block is actually no different than your trust in, as you put it, 'the \[current\] conglomerate of nodes and miners'; strictly speaking, it's not impossible for that conglomerate to choose to work on an entirely different blockchain, thereby rendering worthless your initially chosen genesis block.
    All that matters is that you be able to conduct your business with this conglomerate.
    That is, in&amp;nbsp;fact, the most generic rendition of the problem that Bitcoin must solve: Without any party having to place an uncomfortable degree of trust in any other party, how does one party convince another party to do something?

Firstly, it's patently not true that 'all available data shows that 2MB could be rolled out right now without any negative effect on decentralization'. After all, a large number of influential people have disagreed with that conclusion.
Secondly, there is indeed a counterargument from Core, as linked. Not only does that counterargument include a proposal for a hard fork to at least a 2MB limit, but it also explains what scaffolding needs to be implemented before that can happen agreeably, and *why*.
Thirdly, there is not much data on how the 'economy' surrounding Bitcoin would be affected by a fee event, as discussed briefly in the comments of the second link.

Yours isn't really a question about sidechains in particular; it is a question about off-Bitcoin activity in general.
For example, transfers between users of Coinbase represent the same 'problem', because those transfers don't use Bitcoin.
Now, if users are avoiding direct use of Bitcoin, that is because direct use of Bitcoin is not providing the desired functionality. There are 2 possibilities:
* **The desired functionality is outside of the mandate of Bitcoin.**
    For instance, there's more trust in the world than Bitcoin assumes, and that trust can be embraced to the benefit of everyone.
    In this case, Bitcoin is still useful; it is not in competition with the off-Bitcoin system.
* **Bitcoin is inferior to a competing solution.**
    Maybe there's a system that, based on the knowledge gained over the years, has a superior design. It does everything that Bitcoin does, and it does so better.
    In this case, Bitcoin may not be still useful; it is in competition with the off-Bitcoin system.
    The obvious solution is for Bitcoin to incorporate those superior characteristics. However, what if that's not practical to achieve? Indeed, if Bitcoin becomes a large foundational system of global interaction, then fundamental change might become very difficult to implement.
    Of course, the off-Bitcoin system will want to attract users; one way to do so is to make it possible for Bitcoin users to transfer control of their BTC to the new off-Bitcoin system, thereby tapping into the existing network effects and distribution of tokens—that is, one way to do so is to make the off-Bitcoin system a sidechain of Bitcoin; this off-Bitcoin system could also make use of the existing Bitcoin blockchain as well, thereby preserving the use of the information it contains.
    From the perspective of the user, this is a way to escape a dying system in order to join a growing system; from the perspective of the user, this is just a voluntary upgrade.
**In each case, there's nothing to fear.**

It's not untrue.
When people say 'blockchain', what they mean is 'using a Merkle tree to store a cryptographically auditable history'.
People involved in Big Data (*e.g.,* IBM, bankers, etc.) have discovered source code management; they've realized that they can start managing their vast amount of transactional data the same way that programmers have done so for the last decade: `git`.
\[The\] 'Blockchain', as they call it, is just a version of the `git` source code management tool that has been specialized for their domain of expertise. It provides a standard way for multiple institutions to work together on a common record of history. That's it.
Proof of Work, especially when compounded through chaining, is merely a spam filter that makes it difficult for anyone but honest users to participate, and thereby also naturally drives consensus towards one record; yet, as with git, such functionality is not required in order for 'blockchain' to be useful. Most systems don't require the ability to be run by *anyone*.
That being said, an inevitable disruption in their sector, though, will ultimately be Bitcoin; Blockstream's goal is to create an [Internet&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Money]( with Bitcoin as the backbone, where BTC serves as the valuable common medium of exchange between all manner of systems (both private and otherwise, both blockchain and otherwise). In the end, the banks will have to interface with this Internet of Money; it's inevitable, because the world's economies need a common infrastructure to reduce inefficiencies.

Blockstream first deployed the concept on its sidechain "Alpha", which is part of Blockstream's "Elements" project.
At the time, it was thought that the introduction of SegWit to Bitcoin would require a hard fork, but then it was discovered that a soft fork would be workable.
At the moment, there is an entire testing network (a&amp;nbsp;testnet) that is devoted to running a SegWit-enabled version of Bitcoin (with its own worthless BTC), so that developers can work with the SegWit protocol more or less in practice, and thereby prepare their software for deployment on the actual Bitcoin network.
Moreover, a soft fork is more or less opt-in, and modern methods for managing a soft fork are rapidly maturing.

Of course, that is complete nonsense.
* For one, nothing has changed fundamentally; that's why no fork (soft or hard) was required to deploy it.

* The benefits of RBF far outweigh your perceived double-spend threat.

Also, it will enable much smarter handling of related transactions (e.g., consolidation of multiple transactions into 1).

* I don't understand your persistent ineptitude.
    From [the roadmap](
    &gt; The segwit design calls for a future bitcoinj compatible **hardfork** to further increase its efficiency--but it's not necessary to reap most of the benefits, and that means it can happen on its own schedule and in a non-contentious manner.
    So, a hard fork is planned, and it will include not *just* some measly, worthless, poorly implemented increase in the block size limit, but *also* other important changes, all in one go.
    Furthermore, from [the FAQ]( there is an entire section devoted to this question:
    &gt; *Segregated witness still sounds complicated. Why not simply raise the maximum block size?*
    &gt; \[&amp;hellip; much explanation &amp;hellip;\]
    &gt; we do expect to make **hard fork*****s*** in the future.
    and:
    &gt; *If there’s eventually going to be a hard fork, why not do it now?*
    &gt; \[&amp;hellip; much explanation &amp;hellip;\]
    &gt; The actual effect of these technologies is unknown, but scaling now with a soft fork that has wide consensus allows us to obtain the immediate gains, test and measure the mid-term possibilities, and use that data to **formulate long-term plans.**
@_date: 2016-02-23 06:20:08
Besides the potential technical problems associated both with larger block sizes *and* with hard forks, it is quite frankly philosophically repugnant to evolve a supposedly decentralized system by means of a forcible change.
At best, it would mean that users must keep abreast of potentially incompatible changes. At worst, it would mean that there is, in&amp;nbsp;fact, no escape from the thumb of the powers-that-be.
*Maybe*, [there is a better way](
@_date: 2016-02-23 22:54:17


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Second, we describe in detail the range of consequences different breaks have. For example, one interesting and counter-intuitive result is that an adversary with access to a simple pre-image oracle does not gain an advantage for mining by just working on the block header. However, with a few calls, the adversary can use the flexibility of the coinbase transaction and succeed in mining the next block with high probability.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Third, our investigations raise concerns about the currently specified migration plans for Bitcoin. Although the current plans are a first step in the right direction, we show that they are both overly conservative in some respects, as well as inadequate in others. For example, it is not clear that if someone owns a Bitcoin now, they will still have access to it in a year, if a primitive has broken in the meantime.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As a tangential fourth contribution, we introduce an oracle model for hash functions that unifies several existing types of breakage and allows us to specify forms of hash function breakage that are closer to real-world attacks.

Node configuration is *not* what is meant by 'opt-in'.
As stated:

Satoshi told us how: The longest chain of proof of work. That&amp;nbsp;is, in&amp;nbsp;fact, what consensus is; that&amp;nbsp;is, in&amp;nbsp;fact, just a restatement of the whole point of Bitcoin.
While one transaction might make it to hundreds of nodes, so might its double spender; it takes but one miner to include in the blockchain the 'wrong' transaction, so that eventually even those hundreds abandon the 'right' transaction as they all descend upon consensus with exponentially growing fortitude. We don't know what the network thinks until it gives us the blocks.

These proposals build on top of efficient relay techniques (like the relay network protocol or IBLT) and move virtually all the transmission time of a block to before the block is found, eliminating size from the orphan race calculation. We already desperately need this at the current block sizes. These have not yet been implemented, but fortunately the path appears clear. I've seen at least one more or less complete specification, and I expect to see things running using this in a few months.

However, please read [The RBF FAQ](
* Specifically, [this](
    &gt; **What is “Child pays for parent” (CPFP)?**
    &gt; Child pays for parent is a way of adding fees to a transaction by making an another transaction that depends on the first.
    &gt; **Why wasn’t CPFP used for RBF?**
    &gt; Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) doesn’t solve the same problem. RBF allows the *spender* to increase fees; CPFP is useful because it allows the *recipient* to increase fees.
    &gt; RBF has the advantage over CPFP that it doesn’t necessarily require using any extra block space, so it’s more efficient by about [30% to 90%](
    &gt; The plan is to support both CPFP and opt-in RBF.
* [and this](
    &gt; **What if I think that RBF is just awful?**
    &gt; Then don’t use it: don’t set it on your own transactions and treat transactions you receive with all sequence numbers less than MAX_INT-1 as non-existing (or already double-spent) until they confirm. Opt-in RBF is opt-in.
    &gt; No commonly used software that we’re aware of sets its sequence numbers to below MAX_INT-1, and many programs (including “transaction confidence” meters) already regard low sequence numbers as potentially double spendable. After all, the transaction has been explicitly marked as replaceable, and even without RBF, nLocktime may result in a conflict getting confirmed first.
    &gt; If someone sends you a replaceable transaction and you won’t zero-conf credit it, their replacement can make it get confirmed as fast as they want it to get confirmed. The same sorts of situations exist already for senders using non-standard transaction features or spending unconfirmed outputs, which makes transactions objectively more double spendable—but in those cases there is no fix to get the transaction through quickly.
    &gt; RBF is a feature for consenting adults. If you don’t want to participate in it, you don’t need to. Your dislike of it isn’t a reason to prevent others from using it in transactions that don’t involve you.

The purpose of Bitcoin is not to store for all time a globally recognized record, but rather to provide means by which to calculate the probability that some piece of data will remain for all time as part of such a record.
You don't need the entire record in order to calculate a probability that is sufficiently high for your purposes—hence pruning. Indeed, the subjectivity of sufficiency opens up that calculation to market forces; you can keep the necessary data yourself, or you can pay someone else to keep the necessary data for you, etc.
In the end, all you will be able to do is calculate with sufficiently high probability that you did indeed include a message in what will likely be chosen as the timeless record (consider that out of all blocks, the genesis block has the highest probability of remaining in the record, and the latest block has the lowest probability of remaining in the record). However, because nobody necessarily cares about your message, you yourself are going to have to maintain (or later purchase a copy of) the necessary data in order to make that calculation.
**tl;dr:** The Bitcoin network is fundamentally ***NOT*** a timeless record.

* &gt; Is double-spending really a problem?
    The whole purpose of Bitcoin is that it solves the double-spending problem *without* requiring a trusted party that is centralized.
    The issue here is that people want to make instant transactions.
    While it's true that a Bitcoin transaction flies to a recipient at the speed of the Internet (just like an email), it still takes time for the Bitcoin network to *confirm* that transaction by writing it into the blockchain—and as the blockchain continues to grow, that confirmation becomes exponentially stronger.
    That is, *fundamentally*, Bitcoin does not provide strong guarantees for a transaction that is not yet in the blockchain. Nevertheless, people tried to *fake* strong guarantees by monitoring the network for double-spends of a transaction that has not yet been confirmed and then denying them immediately.
    That sounds like a good idea, but it actually hobbles Bitcoin terribly; it prevents a user from updating his fee to better reflect how much he values having his transaction processed into the blockchain, and it prevents innovations such as the consolidation of multiple related transactions into 1 transaction (as well as some smart contracts that could benefit from the ability to update a transaction that is not yet confirmed).
* &gt; Does bitcoin really need to be spent directly or couldn't a series of bitcoin holding institutions credit you with a currency they back and which could be spent instantly at vendors while your bitcoin is processed?
    That is perfectly possible.
    After all, there is a lot more trust in the world than Bitcoin assumes, and that trust can be put to productive use so that everyone profits handsomely—the cold, harsh, unforgiving, heartless nature of Bitcoin is not too useful between the local barista and his regular face-to-face customers; indeed, Bitcoin's willful ignorance of the social relationships becomes an overhead in many instances.
    That being said, there is perhaps a much better approach that yields a similar benefit, but still maintains a great degree of independence from trusted, centralized institutions: [The&amp;nbsp;Lightning&amp;nbsp;Network.](
    The data structures and algorithms of Bitcoin permit a higher level protocol to be built atop, which handles locking up bitcoins (just as with your vault, but run by decentralized systems instead of a centralized company) and then allowing participants to negotiate many, nearly instantaneous transactions based on those locked up funds.

    That is, your transaction doesn't mean much until the Bitcoin network begins to settle it in the blockchain.
    Since early on, people were discussing all manner of ways to make confirmations faster, including changing the rate at which blocks are confirmed; people realized that waiting for settlement wasn't going to work well for using BTC as a currency.
* [Hal Finney on 30 December 2010]( (he was the first person to receive a transaction from Satoshi):  


    &gt; Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency.

Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.
    &gt; George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.

Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.**

The idea is that you have to pay the Bitcoin Network for its services (right now, that means you have to pay the miners for doing their work); the idea is that, eventually, hopefully, the Bitcoin Network will be funded in a self-sustaining way by those who actually use the network. However, it's not exactly clear that this will happen, or what exactly 'actually&amp;nbsp;use' means.
The way fees are used by the network is currently somewhat complicated, and—for historical reasons—wrongheaded.
At the moment, you should get wallet software that handles fees more or less without you having to worry about it, and just realize that if you don't want to end up waiting an exceedingly long time for your transaction to be confirmed by the Bitcoin Network, then you'd better supply a transaction fee that is sufficiently high.
With the \[re-\]introduction of the RBF ([Replace-by-Fee]( feature, and the simplification or outright removal of 'priority' calculations, controlling your fees manually will become a lot easier. Until then, don't worry about it too much.

* &gt; without the possibility of RBF
    Fundamentally, there is *no* scenario where RBF isn't possible.
    You cannot prevent RBF, because it doesn't rely on any particular assumption. However, you *can* make the existing double-spend 'protections' unreliable, because they *do* depend on assumptions—the worst kind of assumption: convention (node configuration).
    Nothing has changed fundamentally; that's why no fork (soft or hard) was required to deploy RBF.
* It is downright stupid to build an ecosystem around per-node, third-party convention—in&amp;nbsp;fact, relying on such convention is what makes your existing double-spend 'protections' both fake and *not* merely 'a feature for consenting adults'.
    The RBF feature strips away unnecessary assumptions in a way that is explicit to all parties involved; stripping away unnecessary assumptions is important for innovations to occur. 
    The benefits of RBF far outweigh your perceived double-spend threat. For one, it will allow a user to express much more accurately how much he values getting his transaction processed into the blockchain. Also, it will enable much smarter handling of related transactions (e.g., consolidation of multiple transactions into 1).
    Please read [the&amp;nbsp;RBF&amp;nbsp;FAQ]( It is illuminating.
* There's nothing to stop Bitpay from doing any calculation it wants in order to insure payment with reasonable certainty; that is, in fact, their business.
    Other, higher-level protocols (such as the Lightning Network) could make all of this a moot point.
* The merchant in your scenario could use CPFP to bump the incentive for miners to process the transaction in question, and treat the added cost as a cost of business. That is, the merchant need not rely on the cooperation of the customer.
* The customer has an incentive to get his transaction processed quickly; besides wanting to conclude business with the merchant, the customer may also want his change to be confirmed so that he can spend it without trouble as soon as possible.
* &gt; And again, just because they added a fee still does not guarantee a confirmation in the next block
    And what, then, of your desired case where no fee can be added? Then you're truly shit out of luck.

    What I love about Bitcoin is that it either works or it doesn't; there's no room to fake it; in the end, the 'human' factor is necessarily squeezed out without even trying—the human factor will go bankrupt without a strong technical backing, and thereby spare the rest of us from the continuation of its inept decisions.

Behind the civility lurk immensely incompatible views, hidden by virtue of the fact that social graces take more importance than hard facts. Consequently, the face-to-face standard makes communication far less efficient.
    In contrast, faceless communication allows participants to state concisely and precisely what they think, unbound from the ancient shackles of the kinship instinct.

The core protocol of Bitcoin might be terrible for this purpose, but perhaps a higher-level protocol layer like the Lightning Network would make it feasible.
Those who want the certainty of the core protocol of Bitcoin could pay to have their income settled as soon as possible; most people probably wouldn't care to do so; most people would be content to continue conducting their business at the Lightning Network layer.

Yes, but only because being opt-in makes it \[philosophically\] backwards compatible with the existing, futile attempt to *fake* meaningful guarantees for zero-confirmation transactions. It allows for the system to make a transition away from the poor conventions introduced in the past.

I suppose you mean that consumer prices within the Eurozone are falling. 
However, that's not true; rather, the annual percentage increase in consumer prices is considered 'too&amp;nbsp;low' (less than the magical 2%), and it is feared that this percentage will become negative (*i.e.,* that consumer prices will begin to decrease).
The decrease in the price of *X* means at least one of the following:
* Increases in productivity (usually including increases in competition) have made the production of *X* cheap enough to warrant lower prices.
    This is a sign that the economy is going down the correct path; the economy has greater wealth than it did in the past.
* There is more of *X* than the economy needs; there is a surplus that must be purged. Too much capital was squandered in making *X*; it would have been better to allocate that capital to the production of something else.
    This is a sign that the economy was going down the wrong path; the economy has less wealth than it did before. However, it is also a sign that the economy is naturally trying to correct its mistake, if only it were allowed to do so.
    At best, a central bank or government could try to help the economy find a better way to use its capital, but that depends on the notion that a central bank or government is a good allocator of capital; yet, there is little evidence of that being true—in fact, so much capital is usually allocated to the production of *X* in the first place precisely because of the wrong economic signals introduced by the meddling of the central bank or government.
In short, falling prices can be either good or bad, and if they are bad, then it's because the economy is trying to correct its mistakes.

* [Consider the FAQ](
    &gt; **Is opt-in RBF only useful for adjusting fees?**
    &gt; No, another useful thing wallets can do with opt-in RBF is combine two or payments into a single payment when the first payment hasn’t confirmed yet. This can save a large number of bytes and transaction fees even though the replacement will have pay a higher fee than the original.
    &gt; Opt-in RBF can also be used to implement more advanced cooperative stability schemes such as [transaction cut-through](
    &gt; Various [smart contract]( cases also need replacement, but they usually use locktime to create stronger ordering and work around the historic unavailability of replacement; these were presumably the motivation for supporting replacement in the Bitcoin protocol in its original design.
    &gt; Although interesting for more reasons than just adjusting fees, the ability to adjust fees should not be understated. It means that the initial fee can use a lower “most likely” estimate instead of having to over-pay “just in case”; this results in lower fees even when replacements are rarely made.

* A standard tool and model to which nearly everyone can agree and which nearly everyone can implement.
* The cheap replication, verifiability, composability, and decomposability of merkle trees (specifically, related Merkle trees; specifically, the growth of a Merkle tree).
* The extensibility provided by the increased practicality of programmable hooks; in the case of 'blockchain', this includes a domain-specific programming language.

How does one engineer Bitcoin so that—as much as possible—the *core* of a complex ecosystem can be improved without forcing \[nearly\] anyone to comply with some experimental alteration that is untested in the real world?
That is, how does one engineer the *core* to evolve according to the organic, objective, measurable, voluntary choices of its users?
@_date: 2016-02-22 16:39:06
Having more implementations is necessarily part of that process. However, to render competition as a fundamentally cooperative activity, 2 things must occur.
* Culturally, people must reject as obviously absurd any incompatible change to an existing system.
* A new system (that is, a probably incompatible implementation) must be fitted within the web of systems just like any other system.
    This can be achieved by means of a [2-way&amp;nbsp;peg]( turning that new implementation into what is currently known as a 'sidechain'.
I *suspect* that a sidechain could be set up to replace its mainchain nearly seamlessly.
Triggered by the fulfillment of criteria whose satisfaction virtually guarantees a smooth transition, the sidechain begins taking on the responsibilities hitherto delegated to the mainchain (*e.g.,* minting tokens, etc.), and thereby pinches itself off from the mainchain to become, in effect, the new mainchain.
 In this way, even the core of a complex ecosystem of sidechains could be improved without forcing \[nearly\] anyone to comply with some experimental alteration that is untested in the real world; the core could evolve according to the organic, objective, measurable, voluntary choices of its users.

Therein lies the rub; therein lies your circular logic.
You are saying that BTC is fungible as long as people ignore all of the things that make it not fungible.


A mixer could deny an input transaction based on its identity (it's history); for mixing to work, a mixer must ignore traceability.
If mixing only works because BTC is fungible, then BTC is fungible for the purposes of mixing because a mixer first strips BTC of traceability through a deliberate choice to ignore traceability; the fungibility required in mixing is a property of removing traceability first.

tl;dr: The Bitcoin network is fundamentally *NOT* a timeless record.
I suspect that people will begin to accept—perhaps without realizing it—that the purpose of Bitcoin is *not* to store for all time a globally recognized record, but rather to provide means by which to calculate the *probability* that some piece of data (*e.g.,* a transaction) will remain for all time as part of such a record.
You don't need the entire record in order to calculate a probability that is sufficiently high for your purposes—hence pruning. Indeed, the subjectivity of sufficiency opens up that calculation to market forces; you can keep the necessary data yourself, or you can pay someone else to keep the necessary data for you, etc.
In the end, all you will be able to do is calculate with sufficiently high probability that you did indeed include some data in what will *likely* be chosen as the timeless record (consider that out of all blocks, the genesis block has the highest probability of remaining in the record, and the latest block has the lowest probability of remaining in the record). However, because nobody necessarily cares about your data, you yourself are going to have to maintain (or later purchase a copy of) the data that is necessary to make that calculation.
More concretely: If you stuff your coins into the cryptographic equivalent of a buried shoebox for half a century, then there should be no reasonable expectation that the network at large will bother to keep the necessary information at the ready just in case you decide to dig them up; you'd better be ready to provide the details yourself, or wait for some archival tier of the network to handle your request.
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:24:32
You are correct. When these people say 'Blockchain', what they mean is 'Using a Merkle tree to store a cryptographically auditable history'.
People involved in Big Data (*e.g.,* bankers) have discovered source code management; they've realized that they can start managing their vast amount of data the same way that programmers have done so for the last decade: `git`.
The 'Blockchain', as they call it, is just a version of the `git` source code management tool that has been specialized for their domain of expertise. It provides a standard way for multiple institutions to work together on a common record of history. That's it.
The 'Blockchain' without BTC *is* useful to them.
That being said, an inevitable disruption in their sector, though, will ultimately be Bitcoin; Blockstream's goal is to create an [Internet&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Money]( with Bitcoin as the backbone, where BTC serves as the valuable common medium of exchange between all manner of blockchain systems (both private and otherwise). In the end, the banks will have to interface with this Internet of Money; it's inevitable, because the world's economies need a common infrastructure to reduce inefficiencies.

The honest, up-to-date miners are supposed to be putting hashing power behind only the new rules, but it turns out that some of those miners are unwittingly putting hashing power behind the old rules.
* Each set of rules would have a not-insignificantly diminished amount of hashing power behind it.
* The fork could be triggered by anyone; even a miner with very little hashing power can trigger it.
* A soft fork can potentially convert a node that is supposedly fully validating into a node that is not actually fully validating, unbeknownst to that node.
    I suppose that modern ways of detecting a possible fork could be used to mitigate this problem.

    From [the Core roadmap](
    &gt; The segwit design calls for a future bitcoinj compatible **hardfork** to further increase its efficiency--but it's not necessary to reap most of the benefits, and that means it can happen on its own schedule and in a non-contentious manner.
    So, a hard fork is planned, and it will include not *just* some measly, worthless, poorly implemented increase in the block size limit, but *also* other important changes—all in one go.
    Furthermore, from [the FAQ]( there is an entire section devoted to this question:
    &gt; *Segregated witness still sounds complicated. Why not simply raise the maximum block size?*
    &gt; \[&amp;hellip; much explanation &amp;hellip;\]
    &gt; we do expect to make **hard fork*****s*** in the future.
    and:
    &gt; *If there’s eventually going to be a hard fork, why not do it now?*
    &gt; \[&amp;hellip; much explanation &amp;hellip;\]
    &gt; The actual effect of these technologies is unknown, but scaling now with a soft fork that has wide consensus allows us to obtain the immediate gains, test and measure the mid-term possibilities, and use that data to **formulate long-term plans.**
* It's only been recently that it has become clear how to *begin* to proceed in earnest; it took more than a year of investigation for simple facts to become obvious, and it's still not yet clear how a hard fork should take form.

Bitcoin fundamentally does not offer the guarantees required for using BTC as a currency.
Worse, people are strangely trying to deny the very tools that would help hide that fact (e.g., RBF).
To raise the block-size limit is no small task, philosophically or practically. If you think you have a better idea for what the block-size limit should be, then:
* In the medium term, your best chance to get your solution up and running is to build it [on this foundation](
* In the long term, your best (and probably *only*) option will be to [implement your solution as a competing sidechain](
@_date: 2016-02-22 14:18:00

Well, what a block provides is a more well-defined probability for whether a piece of data (e.g., a transaction) will remain in a universally accepted record (i.e., the one true blockchain). In that sense, a faster block rate would be beneficial; as it is, right now, you have to wait approximately 10 minutes before you can even begin to calculate that probability with any reasonable confidence.
That being said, you'd still have to wait roughly an hour to receive what is widely considered to be a sufficiently high probability, so it doesn't really improve the overall security much.
It would be better to leave the system as it is (because changing it doesn't do much good), and instead formulate Bitcoin transactions in a much smarter way—that is, it would be better to keep an unsophisticated but proven system at the lowest protocol level, and build a more sophisticated protocol layer on top. That is the hope of something like the Lightning Network.
Linear improvements are just not acceptable to achieve exponential growth.
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:10:25
Take a look at the [SegWit FAQ](
* SegWit potentially reduces sighash operations. Besides reducing the computational intensity, it leads the way to increasing the block-size limit without reducing the transaction size, and thus maintains or improves the ability to make large transactions to pay many members of a pool.
* SegWit makes it easier for miners to deploy other soft forks that could benefit them.
* SegWit offers potentially huge savings on the UTXO database, which must be mostly kept in RAM.
* Miners currently have a hard time calculating the most profitable way to include transactions in a block; apparently, SegWit will be part of a solution that makes such a calculation much simpler.

    &gt; ...
    &gt; I don't think there would be a contentious fork if the people on the Bitcoin Core side would say "OK. We're going to do Segregated Witness *and* increase the block size at the same time."
    &gt; There's plenty of quotes from people on that side previously saying they wanted to increase the block size, and then as soon as they come up with the idea of Segregated Witness, they didn't seem to be as interested in increasing the actual block size the same way, anymore.
    &gt; The part that is so frustrating is \[this massive straw man about improving computation\].
What a horror show!
Firstly, I think she got the argument magnificently mixed up; it only makes sense if swapped the names "Classic" and "Core" in what she describes, and then also moved the supposedly mysterious issue of a fork to the deployment of Segregated Witness—something like this instead:
* What [Washington Sanchez\] had said was "OK. So, on the **Classic** side, most of us agree that Segregated Witness is an awesome idea; and, on the **Core** side, most of us agree that 2 megabyte blocks is *also* an awesome idea. Well, since **making Segregated Witness fully efficient** requires a **hard** fork, anyway"—*which I did not even know*—"why don't we all just basically fork together and incorporate both of our good ideas."
Secondly, Roger Ver keeps utterly ignoring [Core's explicit inclusion of a hard fork in the roadmap]( including an increase in the block size limit to *at&amp;nbsp;least* 2MB.
Thirdly, his emotional distress seems to stem from an anecdotal straw man.

They do indeed impact the fungibility. That's why criminals have asked for unmarked bills; if they didn't impact the fungibility, then they wouldn't bother making that request.
In theory, objects are either fungible or not; in *practice*, objects can only be *practically* fungible—it can only be made *impractical* to consider objects non-fungible.
When someone says that objects are fungible, that person is merely saying that it is impractical to distinguish between them.
Traceability makes it practical to distinguish between bitcoins.

And why not?
If I can conduct my business with 99.999999999999999999% certainty that everything is correct, then I don't give a fuck about not having a completely verified record. In fact, it would be a waste of resources to get that extra little, marginal certainty.
More to the point, Bitcoin cannot ever give you 100% certainty; Bitcoin has shown us that Truth is merely a probability that approaches 100% with time, but never reaches it.
Unless we embrace this fundamental fact, we are in danger of attempting to solve a problem that is much harder than the problem we actually have.
On a related note, the Bitcoin network is fundamentally *NOT* a timeless record.
I suspect that people will begin to accept—perhaps without realizing it—that the purpose of Bitcoin is *not* to store for all time a globally recognized record, but rather to provide means by which to calculate the *probability* that some piece of data (*e.g.,* a transaction) will remain for all time as part of such a record.

    &gt; Going beyond segwit, there has been some considerable activity brewing around more efficient block relay.  There is a collection of proposals, some stemming from a p2pool-inspired informal sketch of mine and some independently invented, called "weak blocks", "**thin&amp;nbsp;blocks**" or "soft blocks".  These proposals build on top of efficient relay techniques (like the relay network protocol or IBLT) and move virtually all the transmission time of a block to before the block is found, eliminating size from the orphan race calculation. We already desperately need this at the current block sizes. These have not yet been implemented, but fortunately the path appears clear. I've seen at least one more or less complete specification, and I expect to see things running using this in a few months. This tool will remove propagation latency from being a problem in the absence of strategic behavior by miners.  Better understanding **their behavior when miners behave strategically is an open question.**

* In the context of the Bitcoin protocol that exists today, the term 'confirmation' is another word for 'settlement'; the Bitcoin network provides settlement that grows exponentially well defined.

Assume there is a situation where traceability does not affect fungibility. In such a situation, it would be possible to differentiate between objects due to their traceability, but not differentiate between objects due to their fungibility—clearly this is a contradiction; clearly, there is no such situation.
Thus, in every situation, traceability affects fungibility.
Fungibility is a binary property; objects are either fungible or they are non-fungible. So, in a situation where traceability affects fungbility (which we've determined is every situation), there are 2 possibilities:
* Traceability renders fungible objects non-fungible.
* Traceability renders non-fungible objects fungible.
Given that traceability concerns differentiation, it is impossible that traceability could render non-fungible objects fungible, leaving only one possibility: Traceability renders fungible objects non-fungible.
Thus, in every situation, traceability renders fungible objects non-fungible.
Thus, fungibility does indeed require non-traceability.

When an economist says that a person is not a rational investor, what that economist is saying is that the person is behaving in a way that the economist himself considers to be not rational; it's strictly comparative.
If you pay money to watch a movie so that you have fun, how is that any different from paying money to run a node, so that you have fun? It's not. It's entirely rational.

When people say 'blockchain', what they mean is 'using a Merkle tree to store a cryptographically auditable history'.
People involved in Big Data (*e.g.,* IBM, bankers, etc.) have discovered source code management; they've realized that they can start managing their vast amount of transactional data the same way that programmers have done so for the last decade: `git`.
The 'blockchain', as they call it, is just a version of the `git` source code management tool that has been specialized for their domain of expertise. It provides a standard way for multiple institutions to work together on a common record of history. That's it.
Proof of Work, especially when compounded through chaining, is merely a spam filter that makes it difficult for anyone but honest users to participate, and thereby also naturally drives consensus towards one record; yet, as with git, such functionality is not required in order for the blockchain to be useful. Most systems don't require the ability to be run by *anyone*.
That being said, an inevitable disruption in their sector, though, will ultimately be Bitcoin; Blockstream's goal is to create an [Internet&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Money]( with Bitcoin as the backbone, where BTC serves as the valuable common medium of exchange between all manner of systems (both private and otherwise, both blockchain and otherwise). In the end, the banks will have to interface with this Internet of Money; it's inevitable, because the world's economies need a common infrastructure to reduce inefficiencies.

In short, the word 'capitalism' is simply a synonym for 'voluntary interaction'.
Voluntary interaction is compatible with both of these philosophies:
* 'me me me, more more more, f\*\*ck the weak and vulnerable, survival of the fittest ...'
* 'we, peers, sharing etc.'
Under capitalism, the foundational selective force is 'Only voluntary interaction is acceptable'; under this selective force, society can evolve phenomena that embody all manner of different philosophies, each of which may grow or fade as befits the other selective forces in play.
Indeed, socialism can work just fine: A person may choose voluntarily to allocate his capital to some socialist endeavor.
Actually, I would proffer that socialism can work *only* when built atop capitalism, because the selective force that capitalism entails naturally [decentralizes]( the creative processes required to find solutions, including the de-funding of bad ideas.

[By 'Bitcoins' you mean 'bitcoins']( and by 'bitcoins' you mean 'BTC'.
Via a transaction, some amount of BTC is placed into someone's control; currently, the entire history of transactions is recorded in a publicly available instance of a data structure called 'a&amp;nbsp;blockchain'.
Because the history of some amount of BTC is not functionally identical to the history of some other amount of BTC, that means that an amount of BTC is not functionally identical to some other amount of BTC; that is to say, BTC is not strictly fungible. That's why there are services that perform blockchain analysis to uncover connections and identities, etc.
Of course, BTC can be rendered fungible to a nearly arbitrary degree; hence tumblers/mixers and other schemes for hiding or eliminating connections.

* I don't see the contradiction; present your case against a hard fork to the hard-fork group.
* Indeed, maybe a hard fork is not necessary.
    I *suspect* that a [sidechain]( could be set up to replace its mainchain nearly seamlessly.
    Triggered by the fulfillment of criteria whose satisfaction virtually guarantees a smooth transition, the sidechain begins taking on the responsibilities hitherto delegated to the mainchain (*e.g.,* minting tokens, etc.), and thereby pinches itself off from the mainchain to become, in effect, the new mainchain.

    Bitcoin must be engineered so as to align its improvement with evolution by variation and selection; a form that seems to establish this alignment is the Internet of Money, whereby BTC serves as a valuable common medium of exchange between all manner of connected systems, so that each user can—perhaps without realizing it—participate in the application of selective forces to the variations that pop up in the ecosystem, and thereby allow even the core of a complex system to evolve in ways that nobody expects.

As far as implementing the core system is concerned, that kind of delineation already seems to be ocurring naturally; the system is evolving nodes that only handle proof-of-work (SPV mining), nodes that only handle history management (non-mining full nodes), nodes that comprise a relay network, and increasingly isolated code that is solely responsible for implementing consensus. The wallet code in core always seems like it's on the verge of being ripped out.
In the broader ecosystem, there are nodes that handle transactions meant as currency (SPV clients, hopefully the Lightning Network, and domain-specific systems that are mostly centralized). With the 2-way peg mechanism (which already deployable permissionlessly in the form of a federated peg), the freedom to innovate specializations grows humongous.

The Tragedy of the Commons virtually never happens, or lasts only but a while, because it is unsustainable; you're going to have to pay for your usage of the resource in question, and in the case of Bitcoin, that means you're going to have to pay for access to the information that you require in order to calculate the desired probability.

    &gt; \[&amp;hellip; much explanation &amp;hellip;\]
    &gt; The actual effect of these technologies is unknown, but scaling now with a soft fork that has wide consensus allows us to obtain the immediate gains, test and measure the mid-term possibilities, and use that data to **formulate long-term plans.**
    It's only been recently that it has become clear how to *begin* to proceed in earnest; it took more than a year of investigation for simple facts to become obvious, and it's still not yet clear how a hard fork should take form.
    **Deliberation has continued to produce a superior path forward.**

It's clear that Bitcoin is not the right tool for the job you want; it fundamentally doesn't offer the guarantees that you seem to require.
Is your application currency? If so, neither you nor the rest of the world will use Bitcoin for that—because Bitcoin is a terrible currency system; it's a fantastic settlement system, but a terrible currency system.
Fortunately, we'll be able to build a Currency system on top of Bitcoin.

That's true, but at the cost of increased block usage; also, not every transaction does involve change.
Furthermore, [RBF is useful beyond bumping the fee](
Besides, as far as the Bitcoin consensus is concerned, there is no difference between a transaction that is marked explicitly as supporting RBF and a transaction that is marked explicitly as *not* supporting RBF; RBF is [what Bitcoin consensus *actually* supports](

That's because there's a great deal more trustworthiness in the world than is assumed by Bitcoin (the consensus system).
It was and is a mistake to have imported into the design of the Bitcoin network our social species's inherent reliance on kinship-level trust to get shit done.
The *core* protocol of this ecosystem is not the right place for dealing with zero-confirmation transactions; it's literally outside of the scope of Bitcoin.

Well, that statement is imprecise.
It's true that, for example, a government could forcibly confiscate people's resources (e.g., taxation or slavery, but I repeat myself) and then spend those resources to create Open Source software.
In that case, the Open Source software would clearly not be the result of capitalism.
So, that statement should be: Open Source software is entirely compatible with capitalism, and indeed, capitalism would likely always result in Open Source software.

**I want BTC to be used as a currency.**  
People are working hard to make that a reality.
* The Currency app requires nearly instantaneous confirmation of each transaction.
* It is not the case that the existing Bitcoin system provides nearly instantaneous confirmation for each transaction.
* Therefore, the existing Bitcoin system is not the Currency app.
Fortunately, the existing Bitcoin system's capabilities are probably enough to allow for simulating the Currrency app to a nearly arbitrary degree of accuracy; the existing system forms a self-contained, coherent protocol for settlement on which another, higher-level protocol can be built to provide to BTC the properties of currency.
**This is *not* a competing vision; this is *not* a re-imagining of Bitcoin.**
BTC is a unit of account. Bitcoin is a settlement layer. The Lightning Network is a currency layer built on top of Bitcoin; the Lightning Network turns BTC into a currency.
Currency is but one app that can be developed on top of a settlement system; Bitcoin as a settlement layer has been discussed since the dawn of Bitcoin.
* [Satoshi on 30 September 2010](  


    That is, your transaction doesn't mean much until the Bitcoin network begins to settle it in the blockchain.
    Since early on, people were discussing all manner of ways to make confirmations faster, including changing the rate at which blocks are confirmed; people realized that waiting for settlement wasn't going to work well for using BTC as a currency.
* [Hal Finney on 30 December 2010]( (he was the first person to receive a transaction from Satoshi):  


    &gt; Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.
    &gt; George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.
    &gt; I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the "high-powered money" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. **Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to *settle* net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.**
* [hashcoin on 04 July 2011]( described what became known as a 'payment channel', the fundamental protocol on which the Lightning Network is built:  


    &gt; ...
    &gt; In this scheme, money is tied up, but still cannot be spent by the other party without authorization from you.  On the other hand, you can provide that authorization to them **instantly** offline of the blockchain.
Whether or not you call the whole functioning ecosystem 'Bitcoin', the fact remains: There must be a settlement layer, and there must be a currency layer built on top of that settlement layer.
We've got the settlement layer working pretty damn well. Now, we're working on the layer that will provide cheap, high-volume, instantaneous confirmation for transactions that represent usage of BTC as a currency.

A vote can only be made in earnest when made in secret.
However, ironically, the secrecy of a vote can only be enforced when the vote is made in a public space; otherwise, an attacker could force his will on the voter in a private space, and the rest of the voting system would be none-the-wiser.
In short, it's not a good idea to allow voting anywhere else but in a shared, official, public space; being able to vote online from the 'comfort' of one's home is a bad idea.

* RBF and CPFP are complementary; RBF doesn't require the sender to be a receiver in order to be useful to the sender.
* RBF is useful for more than just bumping up the fee.

**This has very little to do with congestion.**
Since early on, it has been pointed out that Bitcoin's handling of transaction prioritization has been badly crippled by 2 things:
1. A futile attempt to give zero-confirmation transactions in the core protocol a well defined probability of making it into the record.
2. An arbitrary and capricious calculation of priority.
Fortunately, the RBF ([Replace-by-Fee]( feature—which is essentially an original feature that was removed because it was badly implemented by Satoshi—will allow a user to express much more accurately the value he places on having his transaction make it into the blockchain.
As Bitcoin is stripped of unnecessary assumptions and unenforceable conventions, problems like this will begin to disappear; after all, a user should have very little reason to fret about fees unless there is some extraordinary event going on—software should be handling issues like this in a more automated way.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:25:21
That's why the RBF ([Replace-by-Fee]( feature has been \[re-\]introduced to Bitcoin; in the future, it will be possible for you to update your fee to better reflect how much you value having your transaction processed by the Bitcoin network—even better, your wallet will be able to make these adjustments for you automatically. Even better, this will be much less of an issue when operating with a higher-level protocol such as that of the Lightning Network.
Until then, I'm afraid you're probably stuck waiting; this is an unfortunate consequence of people's futile attempt to fake meaningful guarantees about zero-confirmation transactions (and also because people have hithero had no respect for a fee market).
@_date: 2016-02-16 17:17:13

However, in practice, those levels have traditionally been eschewed because they are overkill.
Furthermore, even if those levels were chosen (and the underlying algorithms were provably sound), they must still interface with systems that operate on a much lower level.
For example, your gigantic, impossibly derivable private key is probably just lying around in some weakly encrypted file on your broken Windows machine, etc. Despite your fancy algorithms, some malware based on social engineering will grab it from you. All you can do is try to make that private key data a little more obscure in the traditional sense.

    &gt; [What is the likelihood of that happening?\]
* **Roger Ver:**  


    &gt; ...
    &gt; I don't think there would be a contentious fork if the people on the Bitcoin Core side would say "OK. We're going to do Segregated Witness *and* increase the block size at the same time."
    &gt; There's plenty of quotes from people on that side previously saying they wanted to increase the block size, and then as soon as they come up with the idea of Segregated Witness, they didn't seem to be as interested in increasing the actual block size the same way, anymore.
    &gt; The part that is so frustrating is \[this massive straw man about improving computation\].
What a horror show!
Firstly, I think she got the argument magnificently mixed up; it only makes sense if swapped the names "Classic" and "Core" in what she describes, and then also moved the supposedly mysterious issue of a fork to the deployment of Segregated Witness—something like this instead:
* What [Washington Sanchez\] had said was "OK. So, on the **Classic** side, most of us agree that Segregated Witness is an awesome idea; and, on the **Core** side, most of us agree that 2 megabyte blocks is *also* an awesome idea. Well, since **making Segregated Witness fully efficient** requires a **hard** fork, anyway"—*which I did not even know*—"why don't we all just basically fork together and incorporate both of our good ideas."
Secondly, Roger Ver keeps utterly ignoring [Core's explicit inclusion of a hard fork in the roadmap]( including an increase in the block size limit to *at&amp;nbsp;least* 2MB.
Thirdly, his emotional distress seems to stem from an anecdotal straw man.

Perhaps one should make a distinction between centralization and \[voluntary\] cooperation: Centralization is a phenomenon that occurs under coercion or cooperation; centralization is undesirable when it involves imposition, but desirable when it improves efficiency.
Unfortunately, centralization that starts out as cooperation can end up as coercion.
Though a slight misnomer, the term 'decentralization' refers to the establishment of structures that clearly demarcate and eliminate (or otherwise suppress) some kind of coercion; political revolution is intended to involve 'decentralization'.
Thus, without contradiction, a 'decentralized' system permits some centralization; more precisely, a 'decentralized' system permits cooperation. What makes a system 'decentralized' is that it, within its purpose, denies coercion—when coercion appears, it is so easy to identify and route around, that it cannot last long enough to make a significant impact.
Let us hope that Bitcoin and its ecosystem [can be engineered]( well enough to achieve this 'decentralization'.
@_date: 2016-02-12 20:18:41
Let me put it another way, The solution is, again, technical; the issue here is a question of engineering:
* How can Bitcoin be engineered so that—as much as possible—the *core* of the complex ecosystem around it can be improved without forcing \[nearly\] anyone to comply with some experimental alteration that is untested in the real world?
    That is, how does one engineer the *core* to evolve—perhaps without anyone realizing that it is doing so—according to the organic, objective, measurable, voluntary choices of its users?
What we want is for the very structure of the system itself to force decision making down a *technical* path, because the very structure makes that the path of least resistance; there should be a clear way not *just* to present one's ideas, but to *implement* them and deploy them *permissionlessly* into practice without disturbing the known, existing, working system. In this way, every interested part may travel of its own volition down a given technical path—and yet *escape* back up the path when investigation yields doubt about its destination.
 
That structure is the [Internet of Money]( implemented with [2-way pegs]( between systems, and setting Bitcoin as the backbone, where BTC serves as an extremely valuable common medium of exchange.
In particular, I *suspect* that a sidechain could be set up to replace its mainchain nearly seamlessly: Triggered by the fulfillment of criteria whose satisfaction virtually guarantees a smooth transition, the sidechain begins taking on the responsibilities hitherto delegated to the mainchain (*e.g.,* minting tokens, etc.), and thereby pinches itself off from the mainchain to become, in effect, the new mainchain.
Creating the tools to establish these connections between system, and coming up with technically sound protocols for pinching off sidechains, is a good place to start setting the foundation for this future of completely technical evolution.
