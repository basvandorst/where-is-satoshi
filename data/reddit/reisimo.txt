Talk to someone who doesn't understand Bitcoin and ask them if they think only a dumbass wouldn't remember 12 words to access their money.  
I know lots of people are eagerly awaiting the coming financial apocalypse but for the rest of us banks can serve a useful purpose.  If you want to personally secure your own coins that's your choice - but clearly there are plenty of people seeking a third party to do this service for them - because only a minority really want custody of their own money.
Bitcoin still has lots of great purposes but will only reach its potential with widespread adoption (it's the only thing that matters) - most people will want to secure them cheaply, easily and safely.
Unfortunately remembering 12 words does not work for most people so they use exchanges which obviously can have negative implications for all of us.

Long time reader, first time comment. A brilliant speech by Andreas. It prompted me to sign up to reddit so I could comment. For bitcoin to really take off we need people like those in his audience to move from smirking about bitcoin to start to take serious notice.  I don't think anyone in the room would be worried about BTC, but maybe that happens down the track.  Right now moving people to actually think about BTC as a serious financial instrument, not something perceived to be the exclusive preserve of "gangsters", has to be the goal.
