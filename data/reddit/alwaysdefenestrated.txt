It's not money the US government can do anything useful with. As of right now they can't pay their debts with bitcoin so they need USD.

Oh come on, the US doesn't give a shit about you running Linux. The Tor developer didn't do anything wrong but it's pretty clear that the US does not like people having access to software like Tor. Of course that's fucked up and wrong but expecting to be detained for no reason is paranoid as hell.

Yeah, this is straight up narcotics trafficking as far as the DEA is concerned, and I can't see it going well for them. Hell, Tommy Chong went to jail for doing the same thing with fucking bongs. OP is delusional if they think the federal government will be okay with this.

Eh, a similar war has been fought very the pronunciation of "gif" despite the creators saying it's a soft G. So many people thought it was a hard G for so long that these days I probably hear the hard G more often than the soft. 
I'm in the soft G camp for "gif" , but odly enough doge rhyming with vogue makes more sense to me. 
Regardless I bet both pronunciations remain common unless Dogecoin somehow becomes so widely used that it's said out loud IRL even more often than "gif" is, which I sort of doubt.

That level of drunkenness, however, may drastically increase or decrease over the course of the night.
