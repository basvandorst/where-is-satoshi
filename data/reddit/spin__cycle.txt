Can you please suggest a desktop wallet that can store multiple types of coins?
I want to continue to store the various coins I have on bittrex &amp; binance!﻿

Moving KRW to USD and the tax implications. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:33:13
Yeah, a few questions were conveniently avoided. Also, the question about why use bitcoin for coffee when you can instead use visa or venmo. I guess they don't really know the answers to these questions. We'll only have to wait and watch.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:59:11
Wait. The revenue from lack of SegWit doesn't go to Coinbase, it goes to the miners. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:42:15
They believe the larger block size helps in scaling. 
In reality, it will help to a tiny extent. Same problems after that.
We need to wait for off chain solutions such as Lightning Network to effectively address the scalability.

Will recover eventually. Just like it always has. Always.

In the last few days, the price has been correlated.
Earlier in December, BTC was the first to make the run. ETH and LTC followed later.

I saw this video on "Cryptodaily" youtube channel a few days ago!
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:40:04
lol. this the best!
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:12:55
It is, and it isn't weird!
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:58:37
The community was pro-Segwit and anti-Segwit2x. (Segwit is different from Segwit2x)
Since the Segwit UASF in August, although Bitcoin has Segwit capability, the wallets haven't been fully making use of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:36:14
who did? Lehmann, AIG? who?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:58:14
Yeah. 'Emerging economy' would be a better term. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:26:44
The volume is also much lesser than earlier in the week. Like 10 times lesser.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:50:16
BitMex is now at the top in terms of volume in coinmarketcap.
How did this suddenly happen!
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:21:17
Military and other government spending! 
They cut down the tax more than they cut their spending, so they need to borrow that deficit. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:41:17
Lol. Its interesting how Novogratz shows up only when the market is a bull! Conviniently stays away when the market is bear.

What's the primary demographic of this TV show? I thought it was millenials, in terms of age group. (Granted, there's a gender divide in bitcoin interest.)
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:53:39
Good point. Like how many people understand an interest rate hike, or a debt ceiling increase. Everyone takes on personal debt without ever knowing about the Federal funds rate.
The ones who understand the fundamentals and macro stuff give themselves a chance to benefit out of it. The rest who stick to micro-economics only go along with the flow.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:39:08
I know right. lol
Perhaps OP is a whale, warning us of their massive dump!
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:32:50
Big Bang Theory viewers = average public = the people that Bitcoin needs to entice in order to obtain long-term success. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:30:49
Haha. I panicked last March too. When I saw BTC 'crash' from 1300 to 900, I converted half of BTC to ETH, while was trading near 50 then. Both have done similarly in the 12 months since. Lol
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:26:26
BTC volume is higher than November levels. So higher than the previous bull run.
@_date: 2018-03-06 05:10:47
The people who flocked in during November to December probably got burned during the crash. They're in shock. It'll take time to recover from the effects of the crash.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:46:19
Buy the dump, sell the pump!
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:01:02
Bitfinex ran into problems with US banks when it allowed USD fiat pairing. Binance may face similar problems.
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:20:26
2) They don't care if their Btc is worth 400m or 40m. It's still several fckin millions!
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:26:48
Typically, a large amount of BTC are sold by auction. The trustee adopted a foolish way of dumping btc on an exchange. He was selling a few thousand BTC every few weeks. It remains to be seen what they'll do with the remaining 160K btc.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:32:36
Nopes, lightning is payment channels AFAIK. Rootstock, which is being developed will support smart contracts.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:13:11
500BTC sell wall @ 9000 on GDAX. Current volume is even lesser than 2 days ago. I can't see how 9000 can be breached without more volume.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:42:12
You got your facts wrong kiddo. This was free btc for them.
200K BTC were recovered from the mtgox hack. A 3rd party was appointed to clean up the mess, that is, pay back the people who lost money in the hack. The 'they' you've been referring to is this 3rd party. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:22:38
The trustee said the 35K BTC that have been sold were sufficient to pay back the Mt.gox investors in fiat. It remains to be seen what they will do with the remaining 160K BTC. The market is currently in a state of uncertainty and doubt over these remaining BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:27:21
Sure is, although a higher trap than previous traps!
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:49:22
Need info here! Looking at the address, how do you conclude it's a segwit address?
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:15:22
Yeah, entitlement &amp; expectations are off the roof now. Wasn't this way the last 3yr I've been following btc.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:28:00
Buy orders have increased since yesterday, while sell orders have stayed the same. I can only see the range tightening today.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:16:59
The herd too. The herd is coming.
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:47:48
Lol. Cheapest in a long time could easily be costliest for a while longer.
