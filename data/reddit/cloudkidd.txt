Its so funny that they are AFRAID of deflation!! They know this means a contraction of the banking industry in a large way.

Love this. Great point. Stop feeding the god damn pigeons! 
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:44:41
Wow. 4 years ago lacked a lot of creativity. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:47:14
Are you trying to wash your coin? If so, their are much easier ways of doing it.

Tell me more about your experience with Circle. I've been with Coinbase for a while now, and they for the love of Christ will never fully verify me. Its the last step i have from being able to purchase Instantly more than $100 and their support is horrendous. They obviously know its not fraudulent now that I've made so many transactions, but offer no assistance in getting it resolved. I'm willing to try Circle if they do have instant buy options for BC. Thank for the info

Sending to a bunch of different wallets. There are sites that do it for a fee also. Ill share when I get back home.

My biggest concern would be the fact that he is giving advice on how to put himself out of a job. Strange much? 
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:50:48
Does it scare anyone else when the current government starts accepting BC? I feel like they can only do harm to it. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:21:35
Very true, however there is a solution, and only one solution. And that is the personal acceptance of the individuals personal freedom and liberty. That is the only solution, everything else fails. This is only possible though without Government by force or mob rules mentality (current form of democracy) 
@_date: 2014-09-06 16:29:06
Who is  to  provide fraud prevention then? 
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:50:43


I'm sorry, I wasn't aware regulations were guaranteed. Can you post to what regulations have been discussed for Jan?
@_date: 2014-09-06 23:58:22
And why not? 
@_date: 2014-09-01 15:48:06
Are you actually making money from mining on a single client? 
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:11:16
We need more Government to fix this!

That Satoshi is a ghost man, and made up by bankers trying to move the world to one digital currency. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:46:46
I ask that not for a snarky reply, but b/c those regulations that NY has discussed have not been validated yet. I want to see which regulations are GURANTEED to come into play in January.

Deflation is a good thing.... 
@_date: 2014-10-26 00:46:48
The increase of use of the currency is what will drive its mass adoption. Its impossible without it being spent. Just (trying) to do my part. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:56:24
Why does the price increase bc of halving? Not sure I fully understand? 
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:42:50
Damn that sucks. LOL
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:51:31
They will only support it if it benefits them. This is obvious. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:15:21
Man, if we didn't have the last little bit of our Constitution in place, it would of already been done here. But its coming... people are being breed and engineered today to forget about freedom, and to accept slavery.

With no reason to have Government doing certain ledger functions, we can reduce taxation and thus reduce the size of Government directly. This is a wonderful idea.

Someone 'boo' this man! Go ride Obamas dick. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:24:35
So what happens when those bits reside on a PC('s) thst crashes, or no.longer is accessable? Doesnt this make the process of packet inspection impossible also? 
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:44:11
This is an AMAZING article! 
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:14:47
Regardless that's very old logic. We're revolutionizing the world through Bitcoin. Its time we shift away from the vile marketing/advertising filth of the socialist-capitalist nature we've had. WE have the opportunity to change that. Lets be conscious and self-aware about how much change we can control through this new technology. Don't bring old norms to a new party basically... especially ones that are obvious to taking advantage of people's stupidity. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:24:24
Apologies for the strong emotion. I love what you guys are doing, and especially with cutting edge technoloogy like this. We for the first time can skip all the leech's in the middle from banks, to transfer services, to BS advertisers, and contribute directly to the sources we want to. I just hope we dont care over all the old bad habits of using psychology and advertising to promote such an innovative and free-thinking technology like BC. We can finally rid ourselves of a large chunk of the parasites this monetary system has created. Thanks for the changetip! 
@_date: 2015-07-01 02:36:22
I wish they would have made it an even .50 cents. The whole routine marketing mind tricks of .49 just pisses me off. 
Also, i think this is the first time I've ever needed to put the cent sign. How do I do that? :)

What about a type of "voting ledger" system with a blockchain for secure single voting? That might give each person the voice they have into forming the first truly democratic company. 
Easier said than done?
@_date: 2015-04-18 15:50:08
Dude, get rid of BofA. You're supporting the money powers, whom want to destroy Bitcoin. Or at least control it. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 18:05:07
Love this... so true. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 21:31:42
I'll vote for him. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 02:15:14
Love this. Saved.
