1 billion in companies that take Dollars out of the pockets of Bitcoiners. Not one of them is putting a penny in Bitcoin itself. Don't get too euphoric. 
Downvoted of course because any reply that doesn't praise Bitcoin must be censored. Anyway, feel free to tell me where i'm wrong.

How odd. People here kept telling me the transaction limit is no problem whatsoever. Over and over again. 
Yet a new thread about it on top of the mainpage every single day makes it seem those were lies. It actually seems like a huge problem!
Were they lying to me? Bitcoiners wouldn't do such a thing, right?
Yeah just downvote it till it goes away.

Good thing Bitcoiners don't care about making money.

Amazing argument. Especially from someone who lost all his money to penny stocks. 
But don't worry, this sub will upvote you anyway, as you know.

You sound like a 16 year old Russian scammer.

That doesn't answer my question. What role does Bitcoin play in this story. You seem to avoid that part. So does the OP. I wonder why.

If the numbers of new users would be growing rapidly they'd share their numbers with us for sure. We all know the reason why they're staying quiet.

When you type nonsense like this do you actually believe it yourself? I find that so hard to believe.

There are a billion things that can't be affected. Shall we post this article in every relevant sub?

"Another bubble is coming"
How exactly is this a fact? You forgot to mention that part.

This is not a good comeback, believe me.

Bitcoin shall save you! Just open your heart to Satoshi!

I will potentially win the lottery.
