Interesting.      
It appears that Mr. Pauker has a several patents that, at least on the surface, look relevant to Bitcoin's underlying technology.  That seems promising.          
The people investing obviously know how the amount of money raised fairs relative to other investments in the digital currency space. Hopefully the project lives up to the hype that's already building.

Facebook is going to deliver the market to themselves. They are actively working to design and deploy drones that will bring the internet to remote parts of the world. They have partnered with Ericsson, Qualcomm (remember this name) and others on Internet.org, a non-profit that will bring internet, phones (and other hardware) and programing to the new internet users from the remotest parts of the world (the un-banked, if you will). They've been dying to get into payments and money for years. They are a licensed money transmitter in every state (U.S.) that requires a license. Gotta give them a little more credit, they aren't a bunch of paycoiners.

Title is a false dichotomy.

That's what Ferd of mintpal is saying now (on twitter).  Considering coinfire interviewed him for the article, kind of a big oversight since the article gives the impression he's sitting in a cell some where.

Old news fail. Happened around xmas. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 14:23:44
I see what you did there. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:30:19
How? Were the cops called?       
EDIT 1 - Guys, I believe the story, but you didn't confirm.  Its hearsay. Gotta stick to your typical standards.         
EDIT 2 - What kind of document? When did the arrests occur? Asserting authenticity or legitimacy of a document passed through several chains of custody, without talking about the chain of custody, does not authenticate said document or prove true the statement its supposed to support.  Such standards are how scams persist, yo.         
EDIT 3 - Brush up on your moolah history here:        
EDIT 4 - I believe this to be Ryan's alt twitter account, last active 11hrs ago (a retweet) - the well known encyclopediadramatica article notes he uses his mother's name as an alias:        
EDIT 5 - I have sources who tell me Ryan's Skype account shows that he's online.          
EDIT 6 - **OLD NEWS FAIL** -  (**HAPPENED AROUND XMAS**). Coinfire, ffs, tell me you asked all the who, whats, WHENs, wheres, whys, hows, etc. Come on, can we get a real news source/reporter in digital currency?

Right! The question assumes way too much.

If this question is serious, it answers itself. Stay in school, kids. [Study]( (Oh, sweet, badges! You know who else likes badges?).

Thanks for posting that info about Insight - I didn't know about it until your post. I'm definitely a fan of those sites carrying the blockchain that are clean and clutter-free (chain.so; blockr.io, insight (now), etc.) - less is more sometimes.         
Not sure if I have any, but

I'm not downvoting you, btw.      
I don't disagree w/ the security practice, I'm more interested in the label/langauge.        
I'm not a techie, it took me a long time to wrap my head around a lot of the stuff I now I consider basic.  One thing I did understand pretty well at beginning, however, was the concept of paper wallets.  Believe it or not, vocabulary can be a barrier to entry. Wallet is a great analogy b/c practically everyone has a physical one.  It provides some initial grounding and framing for thinking of bitcoins as spendable currency.  again, thanks for the response.

They're doing involuntary bankruptcy.  They would have said if they were pursuing criminal charges and there would be an official record of it by now (btw, the alleged arrest was around xmas - 2 months ago). I just posted this in the other thread:           
Warning - a little tinfoil-ish: Anybody consider the fact that the story here is that Coinfire made a mistake?  Its odd.  The story did not read did like a typical coinfire story - pretty well thought out, step-by-step break down of how they know what they know.  This time, we got vacuous crap.  You might recall that Coinfire's accounts have been hacked recently following their reports about GAW's legal troubles (ahem...motive).  Fake/planted story?  But what about Syscoin's blog and Ferd's "confirmation" of this story?  Those folks lack credibility - they believed Moolah the first time or possibly worked w/ Moolah to invent a fake lawsuit to exit the chaos when Moo started to collapse. They're also adverse parties to one another in the moo bankruptcy and civil matter, yet supposedly have the same attorney (ahem, holy conflict of interest). They might even need some cash right now (more motive, see the first motive).  Backs can be scratched. Alternatively, they'd probably like questions about their moo involvement to stop.  This story is convenient.  Has any crypto news outfit (if there is one) reported on the fact that the High Court has already ordered (December 23rd) a dissolution order in Moo's Bankruptcy case and the implications thereof?  How about this: it sounds pretty far fetched that Ferd or Syscoin would be under confidentialy orders (they said an agreement, but they probably wanted to say "gag order" unless they didn't know to say that and weren't actually under one) to no speak of Kennedy's arrest - criminal proceedings are separate and a matter of public record absent sex crimes or crimes against children.  The next question, then, is whether that post came from coin fire at all.  Another possibility is that this was an effort to smoke out Kennedy is who clearly too smart for the people he ripped off. Longer Version:

This seems like a decent discussion w/ some interesting points on both sides.  If the number of comments are any indicator, others agree with me.  Why would changes to the wiki - especially on sections for novices/core educational sections - be made before discussion and debate, at least by a committee if not publicly?  Seems like bad policy AND practice.  I take it there's no defined best practice or procedure on this sort of thing (when to make decisions relative to discussion about them)? Maybe that could be a priority - however it happens - to avoid this in the future. Without a standard, we're just inviting unnecessary drama and confusion about what is and is not acceptable.

Who put up the cash for a purported white collar criminal that made off over a million bucks?  I don't believe he was arrested at all. Remember that raft and ocean-liner graphic from Spurlock's documentary?  Borrowing that imagery, most people in this space float along avoiding the obvious icebergs visible on the surface of the water - they fail to consider the monsters just below the surface. I've said it before, will say it again - truth can be stranger than fiction. Ask questions. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:41:45
That's somewhat of a fair response.  Two comments/questions:     
1. What's the hurry to change? Seems like having at least a second set of eyes, if not more, look over decisions impacting material/content on the wiki is a good idea and necessary policy (proof readers = good).       
2. By "committee" I'm referring to a group that *would be willing to find the time spend on the wiki*.  Plenty of volunteer-based non-profits have a handful of people that geek out over community engagement materials because they're good at it - just like they might have some techie members maintain their organization's databases or servers. To me, its clear that there are enough people around these days that willingness to spend time on the wiki isn't an issue.  In fact, I bet there are tons of non-techies with writing/word-smithing skills dying to get involved on something like the wiki but feel like iced-out by people that want to have their hands in everything (that's not a dig at you, btw) or just make decisions because they've misread the community buzz. Maybe you could ask for volunteers to work on the Wiki on this sub-reddit or bitcointalk, don't think I've ever seen a call for help on the wiki before.        
Appreciate the response.
