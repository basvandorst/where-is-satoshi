What do you get from it?
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:11:04
It will be safe for both small and large transactions. Monero is more secure compared to what? Not compared to Bitcoin thats for sure. Ethereum is not decentralised... I've been around and I know for a fact that Vitalik is a central point. 
Do you remember how ETC was made? Do you remember how Vitalik uploaded a photo of the next block? Do you remember how Vitalik himself fell for the so called "smart contract"? How smart is a contract that most people can't even understand, it's only as smart as it's written. Ethereum is not as safe as you may think.
I happen to think that Monero is an interesting coin indeed with it's privacy ring signatures. If you think it's more secure though you have not even listened to the developer himself.
Edit: LN is already here and available on mainnet if you have the right skills. It's just not finished for consumers.
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:33:23
He's a miner. Miner wants more mempool spam is what I'm thinking, 10btc most likely many inputs as well so he would gain from it that way. Otherwise signing for it would be proof of funds.

This is clearly the famous implementation of Satoshi's RNG?

@_date: 2018-01-13 12:02:52
No don't use hitbtc or btrex! Poloniex is a good exchange, however it requires verification and that can be very slow. I have not tried Kucoin.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:07:20
Nope, there is better exchanges that can be used. Not wasting my time on Conbase..
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:34:00
Perhaps. From my perspective it looks like they want to fill the mempool rather than emptying it though.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:33:48
Okay, it was merely a guess that was what you we're trying to hide from. I wouldn't worry about tumbling unless your a big criminal with lots of money that you wan't to hide/wash. The police does not have time to follow people's transaction history over the blockchain for a simple buyer of drugs. They can't even prove you've done anything illegal unless they catch you with the product after ordering.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:51:26
Yeah but why are they not full blocks? It's several minutes after another block has been found.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:28:54
Yeah Binance is what I'm using atm. Stay away from Hitbtc they freeze customers assets frequently. Bittrex leaked customers id's lately and froze some accounts I think. Poloniex is a good exchange but you'll need to verify and that could take time.
Edit: Did you mean for Bitcoin or altcoins?
If Bitcoin it depends on where you live as some only work on certain countries.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:13:34
And they will lose customers as soon as another exchange offers a better alternative. Isn't it nice with decentralisation? Leave the scum behind.

I'm not so sure we will need it in the end as we can't predict what other solutions we could come up with. We might need it though and in that moment it should be easier getting concensus for it as well. I'm not willing to hard fork for now. When we have no other solution I will advocate for it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:50:10
Aww ;(
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:21:11
If your computer is safe then Electrum is safe. Electrum does only support Bech32 as of now unfortunately. Perhaps you could sweep into mobile wallet with segwit support. I've never used mobile wallet so can't say if they have sweep feature however I know which mobile wallet have support for segwit.   
iOS: Edge, GreenAddress, BitWallet.   
Android: Samourai
Edit: Samourai has sweep feature. Tell me if you need more help.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:30:45
Sure but it's still working as it should, so it's not broken, every 10 minutes a block is found. It just needs improving on, so that's what we are doing with segwit, lightning, schnorr, mast etc. If we in the meantime can inform and prevent users from using Conbase fradually, we would also get lower fee's as users flee from their service for better services.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:13:47
You could've just sent it to another altcoin exchange then out instead if your scared CB will stop your account. The police will not go after someone buying weed or other drugs as they're interested in the sellers not buyers.
 It's not proof of purschase just because you've deposited to (insert dark market here). You should do some more research next time.

I'm leaving the bank and investing in joining another bank :P  
It's shocking how many tarded individuals exist tbh. Move from one bank to the other in the name of crypto. I'm not talking about the daytraders making money on it, I'm talking about the people actually getting fooled.

Probably more like temporary problems with withdrawing BTC. Wouldn't that be nice? FUCK CONBASE
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:43:01
It's all FUD lately as the mempool has been clogged up but it's being worked upon. As long as Bitcoin works and improves there is no good reason for altcoins, unless they can offer something that Bitcoin can't. Even then I'm sure more and more altcoins will die off as Bitcoin gets more and new features/improvements. Stay strong and keep on digging for research and soon you'll become a true hodler, hopefully ;)
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:46:25
You should teach this person not to fuck with you. I would never allow anyone to treat me like that. You'll have to fight back and with fight back I mean do more harm then what they've done to you. If you just let them stomp on you for profit they will continue doing that.
You could also try and sue, but I don't think you'll get much out of it. Close your bank account and get a Bitcoin credit card? Then you could just store all your wealth in Bitcoin. A big guard dog would maybe also benefit you.
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:04:02
So you agree with me or what r u trying to say?

@_date: 2018-01-02 00:14:08
Yeah there is at least some spam on the mempool lately. It won't last forever ;)
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:44:15
Yeah you can invest into Bitconnect but how smart would it be? Just because you can set your house on fire, doesn't mean you should. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:58:01
But there is no need to have altcoins when we finished scaling Bitcoin, that's the point here. Weak hands sit on the sidelines waiting for Bitcoin to scale while strong hands invest before.

Investing in what you know will most likely work out. Investing on something you don't know will most likely go to shit. Oh and not putting trust in centralised pre-mined data centers is a good start.

80-90% BTC then ETH + some more altcoin/s. I would never ever invest in BCASH. Beware as there are many scams and many pump/dumps out there! For the record ETC = Ethereum classic, ETH = Ethereum.

@_date: 2018-01-01 23:46:26
First one as far to the right you hover your mouse over and see how many tx pay example for 30+Sat/B = around 30k tx now. To get to 50Sat/B =around 5k tx in queqe. Total tx in mempool = 106 k tx.
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:47:55
There is this thing called vote with your wallet....
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:03:27
It's hard to say as the mempool can either fill up more or get chewed through faster depending on how many wants to transact right now, that's why you should look at that site and see if it starts lowering or going higher. You tx could confirm even if it does not go that low but it's more likely it gets included when the miners have chewed through the layers of people paying above you.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:19:20
Removed downvote, this problem can only exist when people use them. So lets not do that at all. GEMINI or BITFLYER works for customers, not against.
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:20:50
Some advice if your new to crypto trading. There are phishing sites, always use 2FA, never store more than your willing to lose on an exchange, always have several different long passwords and there is many scam pump/dump coins. GL

Transaction capacity will only rise over time with new implementations such as segwit as one example, schnorr is another one.

It doesn't really matter for the central banks. Just Roger Ver alone can change the market in any direction. With all these noobs investing it's not that hard to FUD or FOMO anything really. Just look at all these new cryptos being several hundred millions just from launch. Sure as fucking hell is bubbling in crypto as a whole.
I'm a Bitcoiner so I don't really care. It's so easy making money on these waves with the altcoins and then turn the profit into Bitcoin again :D

The noobs will come back afterwards with their sobbing stories of how they thought of buying in  price here) and hate themselves for not doing it, same thing over and over again.

@_date: 2018-01-01 00:25:11
Makes no sense to me. If that's a fork someone would want it's easier to just fork bcash as they don't have segwit tx in blockchain while Bitcoin does. If someone wants to make a fork of Bitcoin they would obviously include segwit at this point in time. Are you thinking of any specific fork?
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:16:11
Or even better, a hardware wallet where you can look at the adress your sending to from the device itself.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:02:46
It does concentrate on what it does best ;)
First mover advantage does not necesairily apply to altcoins in my opinion they all fight for the crumbles. Bitcoin can't be everything but it can be many things given time.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:04:10
I agree.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:34:48

That is not a good estimate to pay 400+Sat/B when the fee's at 70 Sat/B are being chewed.

@_date: 2018-01-03 04:13:45
Maybe easiest to download Electrum and sweep it, from there sending to Trezor. I did not find any way to sweep in Trezor unfortunately. When you send to Trezor, send it to segwit adress starting with 3.

Surely depends on what you mean with large transactions. I'm not trying to convince you, I just don't agree with you other than what I've already stated. That some altcoins can offer certain things that Bitcoin can't at least for now. That may very well change and I would be surprised if Bitcoin does not have many different layers and soft fork improvements making at minimum alot of altcoins redundant.
Now obviously LN won't be for large transactions at least in the beginning or as it stands now.

Well why did you choose that wallet? You could ask scammer Roger Ver for help as it's his shitty website and there is nothing we can do for you. Your supposed to use a good wallet, a wallet that you control and not a banker.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:50:25
Then you lose funds!?
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:46:55


@_date: 2018-01-07 20:00:47
If it's to complicated for you to send a transaction from one adress to a new format adress, then maybe you shouldn't be invested in crypto before it's ready for mainstream. You could just sit on the sideline and wait for all potential problems to be solved or you could just invest early and maybe earn some profit before the herd comes jumping in. 
If your not using segwit you have no reason to whine about as it's your fault for not using segwit not anyone else. Anytime you send you could send from a segwit adress and get your fee lower than those sheeplets that doesn't use it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:17:53
You should look at current data, my 140 Sat / B just confirmed couple hours ago.  There is only 7k tx at 140+ right now.
Edit: here you can look for best estimation 
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:02:39
I was mainly talking about scaling and transaction throughput. There are some altcoins that do offer something that Bitcoin does not such as privacy. I don't think they will survive in the long run either because new layers will be built on top of Bitcoin that will offer these services as well.
Then there is also this new altcoin threat called Bitcoin forks. I think if for example someone makes an  BitEth fork with Bitcoins blockchain / tx history that would probably be more popular than Ethereum itself. Edit: assuming trustworthy/good developers.
So in a sense I agree that some of them currently offer a service that Bitcoin does not. I don't think Bitcoin forks will survive long term either, but I would rather use a fork of Bitcoin than other kinds of alt except for BCASH. I will never ever use or invest in that shit :)

Paper wallet is only recommended if your really sure what you're doing. A hardware wallet is much more simple, very safe and convenient as you can spend without your private key / seed leaving the hardware wallet. Just because you have it on paper does not mean it's safe if you for example had a keylogger or similar while making the paper wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:17:37
Ledger has integration of more. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:27:22
 &gt; I already switched to a Segwit wallet and so probably did most of the other people on this Reddit sub and what did it help?
You got lower fee for your transaction vs those who decide to stay on Legacy for one. If we can't even get exchanges and wallets to implement segwit, then how are we supposed to get everyone to agree on a hard fork? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:53:16
Antpool and certain actors don't fill 1MB block but talk about wanting 8MB. This makes no sense does it?

@_date: 2018-01-12 18:14:00
What if your a miner that is about to go redundant within a year, a miner that could if sucsessful get an advantage with asic-boost+premine on a shitty altcoin while the others can't and/or are making lots of more money since they currently have alot of hashrate? 
Sure is an expensive attack, but it's nothing compared to the gains. Even if your losing money on the mining you would gain it back immediately when the noobs goes chasing after the altcoins, that they've been stockpiling up on. There is alot of them noobs btw.

@_date: 2018-01-03 04:45:23
How much do you have in your paper wallet? Unfortunately Electrum is probably not ideal as it's has a special kind of segwit adress that is mostly not supported yet. You should probably try on mobile instead. Do you have android or ios?
Electrum is a desktop pc wallet yes. If you'd sweep to it you would only be able to sweep to Legacy adress and not Segwit.
Edit: Also think you will see the tx fee for the tx before sweeping it, not 100% sure though.

So this is not my first bad experience on Hitbtc. They freeze deposits/withdrawals regularly, they even started introducing deposit fees. Can't chat or troll in box if your working against their chat mod pump/dumps. Funny thing is they don't even put up rules for chatbox, most likely because then people would realise how stupid their rules are. Trollbox only good for playing the bcashit game.

Surely Satoshi would like to dox him/herself for fiat paper money. I mean that's just what I would do instead of cashing out what's needed from another wallet that is not known to be owned by Satoshi for the public  /s

It's private key is never leaving the device and has so many benefits such as easy spending, fork split-tools and altcoins on same seed.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:11:44
Both Ledger Nano S and Trezor are great. They both support segwit and they will support lightning I'm sure. I think the Ledger has support for more altcoins you should look at their respective site which ones they support. I would strongly advice against investing in Ripple or IOTA as they are both not decentralised. Both devices will allow you to backup in form of 12 word seed in case of loss of hardware wallet.

Sure it helps, I'm using it and I'm getting lower fee so stop complaining and leave for your almighty altcoin. I will dump them altcoins on top for more Bitcoins. That's how you play the game. Saying it doesn't help is disingenuous at best. Can send a segwit tx with 140Sat/B right now for less than $3.5. Now if you don't care about paying less then go ahead and use Legacy :D
Edit: It would help even more if you actually contributed and use it yourself and stop complaining like a lil bch boi.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:06:03
No that's just wishful thinking. There is no good reason for Core to focus on getting consencus to a hard fork, when they can work on implementing better scaling solutions that doesn't require concensus. It would be much better to work on implement Schnorr than to work on forking to 2MB. 
Core is not the community, even if Core would like to hard fork, I'm not that certain the majority of the community wants it, especially when there are still other alternatives. I don't see the need for temporary solutions over long time solutions. We could talk about hard fork when there is no other solution IF we get to that point.
You should focus your energy on explaining to newcombers how to use segwit and telling your exchanges they need to implement it.

That would only be a problem for those not wanting to pay lower fee which I can't imagine being that many in the end. Even if they want to pay high fee, I can pay using the LN so it doesn't really bother me what others do.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:13:09
It's pointless to hardfork and split the network for such a small increase in blocksize, as it helps minimally at best while still needing to hardfork again in the near future to scale from 2-4MB. Each hardfork splits the network. From 1MB to 2MB we could easily lose 40% or more of full nodes from one single split.
I run a full node and so I can tell you I'm already uploading several GB of data daily. Most people in the world are stuck with crappy ISP's and everyone who want's to run a full node should be able to.
Not only does each hardfork lose nodes, it will also benefit certain miners and the need for more storage for nodes. 
All these downsides just for a temporary increase in throughput, when we can avoid it as far as possible for better implementations that scale more than a hardfork could anyway. If you need a solution to world wide scaling today, there is only one option and that is a centralised solution. The revolution will NOT be centralised.

You and your arguments are a waste of time. If you can't even get wallets and exchanges to implement segwit to lower fee for everyone, then how the fuck are you going to get everyone to agree on hard forking?

@_date: 2018-01-12 18:57:23
That's some nice short term thinking you've got there. What's the point of temporarily save a few $, when you have to pay far more in transaction costs afterwards because you can't think one step ahead? So you both hurt your investment and get higher transaction fee at the same time. 
You either vote with your wallet or you don't. I would never ever give my money to such a shitty exchange, that gives zero fucks about their customers. I'd much rather spend an extra $ on a better sustainable exchange, that helps and listens to you as a customer.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:50:28
I don't care at all about exchanges such as Conbase. There was never a problem getting altcoins for Bitcoins. Decentralised exchanges are coming up that will indeed be great.
That steam is removing BTC temporarily I don't see as a problem at all. We're talking about the future of crypto after all. You may have fallen for the FUD my friend. Segwit, Schnorr and Lightning comes to the rescue and I would never leave Bitcoin for an alt. except for temporarily when trading so that I can receive more of the real thing. 
Altcoins are nothing but copies, sure some may survive if they can offer something that Bitcoin can't. That said Bitcoin have more future layers to be implemented I'm sure and many altcoins will die off as they become redundant sooner or later. Some alts will probably die due to upcoming Bitcoin forks. A fork of (alt) but with Bitcoin blockchain would in my opinion instantly become more popular.
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:45:17

Yeah and you've been able to send to segwit for many weeks while the mempool has been basically empty. Starts sending when mempool is clogged isn't great planning. Sure it's frustrating but nobody really forced you to send with this fee. I still have some funds in Legacy and waiting for mempool to slow down to send the rest.

Reducing fee's by 50% while making tx smaller is a blocksize increase. It's even a smart blocksize increase that you don't need to put more preassure on nodes and no need to hardfork. How would it not help? I'm helping by spreading solutions not by spreading FUD. What blocksize would solve the scaling if I may ask?

I read your post history, as I definetly thought you were trolling. I ended up finding a post from 4 months ago where you've stated your dad had a stroke. So I guess I may have been to quick on judging.
You should make a new post with more info in it. The more upvotes you can get the more likely you are to get solve this case. Would be great if you could share what your father has tried so far and keep asking him questions.
Going through email, bank statement, scan hard drive for wallet.dat file, how many computers does he/your family own and has any computer been thrown out over the last 6-7 years? 
Perhaps he stored it on a so called paper wallet. If so it's a good idea to look through the house for where he could of possibly stored it. Possible that he put it in a bank safe box? A paper with 12 words written on it (seed) or a paper with public/private keys is what your looking for.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:26
Your not a programmer but you want me to show you code? The 1mb is hardcoded to prevent spam yeah fair enough. But increasing the size does not scale more than just a tiny little bit temporarily and makes no difference to spam tx.
 Then you need to increase the size again. That means another hard fork. Hard forks are not easily implemented without concensus. Continually increasing blocksize only makes it more expensive to have your own node. When you only go from 1mb to 2mb that increases the blockchain 2 times as fast. Now imagine the Bitcoin blockchain increasing 10 times faster every year. This is not a good scaling solution, as it will only contribute to centralisation.
Bitcoin is not about being a centralised ledger. It's way smarter to start using segwit, which we've already implemented and then we can soon after go to lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:43:14

Pathetic low life scumbag. He never said anything about Roger Ver owning the site in 2010 you fuckwit. He was talking about how Bitcoin.com is unrelated to Bitcoin. Satoshi spoke out against the site in 2010 doesn't matter that Roger didn't own it back then. He is still trash for owning it today. Do you really think Satoshi would change his mind just because the owner changed? HAHAHA

I specifically asked you to name TWO or MORE. Guess that was not possible or maybe you don't know what your investing into?
Edit: I propably own more than you yeah. But that doesn't matter either or are you going on about the Roger way of doing things, as if how long you've held your Bitcoins or how many you own is making your arguments any better. If you wanna dox yourself and tell the community how many you own thats fine with me. You've said A so time for B.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:38:42
I can't answer that question however you can't send to Electrum bech32 as far as I know without going through Segwit adress starting with 3 first. Segwit adress starting with 3 will make your tx more compact and as such lower your fee's. The bech32 adress will make tx even more compact but will likely not become the norm before enough people has gone towards sw3 adresses. I'm no expert so don't take my word for it. I've heard lightning is compatible even without segwit, but more difficult. So it should be compatible with both I'm guessing.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:42:51
Maybe your having trouble understanding basic stuff. I was asking for you to name two or more developers working on bcash. Not orgs. I know what Bitcoin unlimited is... And I've also been around Bitcoin for hell of a long time. Now please name two or more DEVELOPERS that work on BCASH. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:28:18
Firstly segwit is not untested, I'm using it just fine tyvm. Could you please tell me where you get info that its untested? 
Your so wrong, even if you double blocksize, an attacker, lets say a miner can still implement super many of their own tx low fee to fill the blockspace until the mempool gets bigger and bigger. If the attackers send out 10k tx at 25sat/byte then that means that others have to send a bigger fee to be more likely to be included in a block. So they keep spamming out lets say 10k tx and only mine the ones where people have to pay more than 25sat/byte = profit. 
A blocksize makes a VERY SMALL difference in preventing spam. But it still comes with costs such as bigger preassure on nodes but also harder for smaller scale miners. So we are on the road to centralisation. What would we hardfork to? If we hardfork to 2mb it's such a minescule increase that we would have to hardfork in 1 week again. Scaling by increasing blocksize is not an efficient way of scaling and therefor not a good idea until we've sorted out current spam and fully tried out current solutions (SEGWIT). It's not Core's fault Coinbase is focusing more on randomly starting Bcash market where noone can sell, instead of implementing segwit.
Hardforking to a bigger blocksize needs to be planned and not rushed, ideally we get a good solution so we only have to hardfork ONCE. 
Edit: I'm not just talking about Conbase, I'm talking about all exchanges/wallets.
I also don't like the situation we are at with fees atm. But I'm not willing to hardfork to something new every couple days/weeks/months without concensus splitting the network more and more for each fork. No thanks!

Yeah sure, what does it matter to you? I've been in the space long enough to know who are behind bcash and the reason it exist. If you disagree and want to invest into it then do it. I don't really care. I will still speak my mind and hate on what deserves to be hated. It's not my fault you fall for fraudulent shit. Roger Ver, fake Satoshi, McAfee, Jihad Wu, and their one and only developer who ain't got any kind of innovations.

Ethereum has not worked 24/7 as intended. I would not say it's close to as decentralised as Bitcoin either. So what does it offer? It offers smart contract that are only as smart as they are written. How smart is a contract that you/most people can't understand? Even Vitalik himself has fallen victim to these contracts. Who would you target if you would want to ruin Eth or make changes to Eth? It all comes back to one central person and your 100% in control of Eth. Maybe you don't know but ETC is actually the original ETH. As long as Vitalik doesn't lose his funds it's all a-okay!

So you would put more trust in Cb than Gemini? You know that even if a company is audited they can still do shady shit? I would not be shocked at all if we find proof for insider trading on their exchange or other type of illicit activity. For now it's rumors but we shall see what the future offers. I know I don't trust them and thats enough for me. But then again I never trusted them before this whole insider trading debacle either. 
Btw do you not think it's a very weird way to start trading bcash? Coincidence with alot of FUD appearing suddenly, spam attack, difficulty change, price spikes and dumps happening just before bcash launch. If I was the owner of a big exchange I would at least announce adding new market before letting it go live, but thats just me I guess. They will be compliant until they are not. Things change very fast in crypto, better be prepared.

Thanks I will add this link to my review on the scam wallet!
"Don't use this scam wallet! The only purpose of this wallet is to mislead new people in cryptocurrency that they're buying Bitcoin, when in fact they're not. They claim their fake altcoin (BCH/Bcash) is Bitcoin, because "Satoshi's vision" etc. Falsely labeling Bitcoin as "Bitcoin Core", when there is no cryptocurrency called "Bitcoin Core". 
    
Just look at any exchange and see if you can find this so called "Bitcoin Core". You won't find it and if you do it won't be trading at the same price as Bitcoin. In reality one Bitcoin is one Bitcoin. Bcash however is valued way below 0.1 Bitcoin, does this sound like Bitcoin to you? The Bitcoin community has spoken. If you're new and reading this please do more research before investing or you'll get rekt for sure. If you want to find some more info about the scammer behind this wallet

It's impossible to say how long it will take but you can see the amount of tx paying different fee's on the top chart as far to the right as possible. So currently there are 150k tx in mempool. It's around 30k tx or so to get down to 70Sat/B. This can change up or down depending on how many want's to transact. If your in no rush you should send with around 70-85 Sat/B maybe or you could wait until mempool gets smaller. 
Tip: you can zoom in and out to see what the past has been like or zoom in to get more accurate reading. Also send to segwit adress to get lower fee's but also help the network lower the fee's, as we can fit more segwit tx per block than legacy. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:39:32
Because blaming on core instead of making it better for the users ain't a solution. Trezor and Nano S could do it, maybe CB does not have the money to afford it? What about blockchain.info they should do it as well, I'm not just talking about CB. But expecting a hardfork in a short distance future over a simple segwit fix. I never said Segwit does anything about spam, but it's a blocksize increase without the contentious hardfork. But if they double the spam, why would another miner mine their 25sat/byte instead of those higher 25+sat/byte? Makes no sense to me.
In fact we could all go buy a small amount and start spammin bch chain making it more expensive for those who want include in block but also more preassure on their nodes. It doesn't happen yet on a big scale but if it was main chain it would happen. So back to problem solving we are, it takes time.

This is what happens when you put your trust in scam coins. You should of never touched bcash except for selling it for Bitcoin and then never ever use it again.

Bitstamp for Bitcoin and Binance or Poloniex for altcoins I'd say.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:58:09
I don't think that is a fair comparison of price since your using 3rd parties. If you look at Trezor's site you can buy it for €89 + 0 shipping if your willing to wait until Feb-2018 or + €20 to ship in 3 days.
On Ledger's site it's € 69.60 + shipping (several opts. depending on where you live)
They are both great devices, I've personally only tried Trezor so far and can honestly say you can't go wrong with either. But paying $180 from Amazon when you can buy directly from Trezor for cheaper seems like a bad deal.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:15:37
I never said any altcoin needs my permission to exist. Where did you get that from? Yeah I can hate a scam coin as much as I want, I don't need your permission to hate on scams. I am indeed letting the strongest coin win.

And that's exactly why it won't happen on bcash ;)
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:08:36
Basic economics ;). You must be a multi millionare if you've mined since -09. You're arguing Sat/B when Bitcoin gets lower tx size than bcash does due to optimizations. There are many altcoins out there that are not being used that you can transact freely or as close to free on. That does not last when scaling BIGTIME, which you would've understood if you've been in the game for so long. I never said the current fee's are good or feasible that doesn't change how to scale in a smart way.
Good luck with your economics using a centralised platform. Would be kind of fun to spam bcash network with 0 fee's so that you can keep on the bidding war on your new platform but also store this ever growing blockchain.
 I assume you run a bcash node, or do you leave that to the centralised servers of Alibaba? Will be very easy for you to have a say in what changes will be made. I think you forgot to add that bcash doesn't even use 1MB and yet you want to compare fee's, especially when it's the perfect time for you to compare them.
Paypal is also somthing you could try out, XRP and IOTA they should fit you perfectly. Oh and since your a miner I'm sure you've looked over the bcash hashrate charts...51% somthing somthing...
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:10:30
I would for sure create a new seed to send to.

So he has computer knowledge, remembers how many btc he bought and what year. He doesn't want too look for $6.3m because it's pointless. You are doing the investigating for him even though he has computer knowledge. He can't remember how he bought them, where he bought them or where they were stored last.
Sounds very likely...
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:12:12
Yeah exactly FOR EVERYONE not just for filling a few mb blocks. Thats exactly why we work on segwit/lightning and not blocksize.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:49:08

Never said I was against blocksize increase, but segwit is not being used and and therefor there is apparently no rush to increase throughput either since Coinbase for example is not implementing this simple fix. Tell me how will you hinder spam tx with bigger blocks? Why do a contentious hard fork just now before even trying segwit for ONE blocksize increase that does close to nothing in comparison to other solutions?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:04:00
If your not in a hurry I would as previously mentioned wait for mempool to go down. 
As of now there is no option to manually enter fee's into Exodus which is a shame. They might implement it in the future as an advanced option.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:10:22
Segwit is the answer. If your doing any tx make sure it's segwit not Legacy. Be part of the solution!
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:59:55
There are more than one usecase for Bitcoin and there will be even more. Spending Bitcoin is only one use, hoarding/speculating is one, signing a pub-key as proof of funds could be one use etc. 
I would argue that storing money in a bank account could be hoarding until you can afford or want to buy rather than accrue value.  Could also be savings for your child/s. Isn't holding Bitcoin to get forks one usecase? 
It doesn't really matter. If you buy and move Bitcoin then you have used it even if you haven't spent or sold it.
I'm not against spending your Bitcoins/money either. Everyone does what they want with their Bitcoin and that's that.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:29:03
I don't know if Mycelium supports segwit. If adress starts with 1 it's not segwit. Good thing is when you get your Trezor it has support for segwit adresses starting with 3.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:07:03
No risks except maybe you'll have to do tx again if it drops off mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:50:37
Perhaps it's time they hired some people who knows how to code then... Trezor and Ledger could afford it... If this is about their economy, well I guess it's better for users to migrate away from their shitty customer service then.

If bcash forks and you're on Bitcoin you don't recieve fork anyway. If you're on Bitcoin and Bitcoin forks then legacy+segwit gives fork.

This is not Conbase central. No such things as insider trading? ;) How stupid are you from 1-10? Conbase is not a public blockchain it's a centralised exchange that gives 0 fucks about their customers. Nobody cares they implemented Bcash for trading you retard it's about allowing it at random without announcing it...Then stopping it when people want to start selling and refusing to focus on implement what the customers want - Segwit. Maybe you should start reading instead of typing, you might learn somthing.

Vast majority of people running nodes are not big players, that's just bullshit. There is more than 10k nodes also, some are not online all the time and some are listening nodes only. If you can't run a node you can't be fully sure you've ever recieved a payment. 
It has alot to do with centralisation. What's the point of Bitcoin instead of Paypal if you have to trust someone else anyway?
30-40$ yearly, sure it's not impossible. You never said if you would run a node at that cost or if your broadband is able to handle that load. Bitcoin is supposed to be p2p not Google to Amazon. 26MB as I said is not enough to scale to worldwide adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:30:24

@_date: 2017-12-29 21:59:04
What a waste.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:06:02
And you have a solution to raise blocksize according to fee's/transaction time then? Bitcoin is not about scaling to Visa level. It's about to scale to Worldwide usage.
With these measly 26MB blocks we would raise the blockchain 3.744GB / day, 1.336TB / year. So in the end we would not be able to run our nodes even if we wanted to because of cost with your solution. Only a few big players would continue running nodes = centralisation = trust someone else. Not to mention that a few miners gets a bigger advantage over others everytime we increase blocksize.
Paypal is already a good alternative to both those. Does your broadband allow you to download 3.7GB daily? Does it allow you to upload 3.7GB daily? Would you buy a new 1 TB drive every year to run a node?
I'm not even against raising blocksize when we can't scale in other ways and have good solutions for it along with concensus. Yelling blocksize increase does nothing to scale.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:10:35

Thats why I said an exchange would in my mind be the most simple. That said it's still possible to buy x amount of an atm or several atm's over a period of time although most likely more expensive due to the markup (I've never used an atm to buy btc and therefor don't know what kind of fee's they take). I'm not kidding, I'm trying to help out.

Bcash probably works coz (insert reason here).
@_date: 2018-09-21 16:39:15
Reason you can't use Paypal is because with PP can do chargebacks unlike Bitcoin. So lets say you send seller $100 and seller sends you $100 worth of Bitcoin, you could then initiate chargeback and get both Bitcoin + your PP funds while the seller would be left empty handed.
I recommend not using credit-card either because afaik it carries high fees. You could try Bisq if you don't want to sign up on exchange. I suspect after you've learnt what Bitcoin is and how it works you don't want to exchange it back to fiat :P
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:09:52

Depends on what fee you set and how congested the mempool is. A block is found every 10 minutes on average. You can look here 
@_date: 2018-09-17 21:42:24
If you run a full node you'll have a full copy of the Bitcoin blockchain.
After you've downloaded all blocks you can if you wish help upload to new or unsynced nodes (might require portforward in your router). Bitcoin Core is the most commonly used, it's also a wallet. You don't have to run any LN node to be able to run a full node.
@_date: 2018-09-21 10:19:40
It's a different kind of adress starting with 3 or bc1 instead of 1. It takes upp less space in the blockchain so that's why it's cheeper to use than adresses starting with 1. I recommend trying Samourai wallet, it has really good fee selection, segwit, better privacy etc.

You may make money off it, but have you really made money off it before you've sold it? You only have profit on paper nothing else. 
Besides there are better altcoins out there to make profits off. I've sold mine for Bitcoins and they are still hovering around the same value in BTC as when I exchanged them. So it hasn't really gained anything compared to what Bitcoin has. There are plenty altcoins who have rose alot more compared to Bcash. This is before taking into account that most people have not even had the chance to sell yet and that its creators Jihad Wu, Roger Ver, fake Satoshi, McAfee are shilling it.
Your putting your money behind criminals. Who will they dump on? Did you ever think about that scenario? Have you done any research into who is developing this coin? Or does that not interest you? Can you please name one reason for bcash being better than LTC?
Who will run the nodes when the bcash blockchain rise to 8 times or maybe even faster than that compared to BTC with lightning and segwit etc. They didn't even want to implement segwit... Wake up dude they only made this coin to make more profits from their mining see (asicboost) and pump/dump. They do nothing but try and destroy the whole crypto space but if you feel like thats worth it to you then you do you! Good luck!

It's on a whole nother scale of bad compared to Bcash. Afaik there hasn't been many or possibly any documented cases of people trying to buy Bitcoin and ending up with BGold.
No cases of accidentaly sending to wrong wallet, no use of the ticker symbol (BTC). They don't shit on Bitcoin, try to rename it, don't buy sockpuppets, vote brigade etc.
In conclusion: Why would anyone focus on Bgold even if most people think it's a scam when there is a 100% for sure scam that is magnitudes larger?
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:22:01

@_date: 2018-08-21 17:32:40
I want to use it as currency! I also want to get more value out of Bitcoin than I put in, with that said I never intend on selling all my crypto unless I feel I can buy back more lower. One doesn't exclude the other is my point. 
If I didn't believe in it's future potential I (most likely) wouldn't invest in it at all. I think most speculators/traders w/e you wanna call them invest because they believe in it, otherwise why not invest into something you actually believe in.

- The subreddit echochamber for Bcash uses BTC. Couldn't think that far, now could you?


- Good keep buying the Bcash because nobody else wants it anyway and I would love it if YOU invest everything you own into that sinkhole. Now hurry back to the echochamber before your overheat your last braincell.

Who cares what "they" aka a bunch of scammers think? The majority decides what it's called and we are the majority not them. Besides this the bcash subreddit is full of personal attacks, bots and sockpuppets.
The hypocritical thing is Roger Ver started calling Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core to discredit Bitcoin and lure newcombers into thinking Bcash is Bitcoin, then gets mad when the community responds with naming the new altcoin Bcash.

What is most important is your private key. Without your private key it's not possible to gain access to your funds. Don't reuse adresses to improve your privacy, however it's possible to send several times to one adress. When you want someone to pay you, you will have to give them your public key so they can send funds to you.
Example: Your emailadress is the public key and the private key is your password to be able to spend the coins/send email. If the adress starts with 1 it's not a segwit adress.
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:14:01

You don't help those who are decieved by calling Bch, Bitcoin. You only help them deceive more people by calling Bcash, Bitcoin.

It was them pumping it up, they've been selling Btc and buying Bcash. If they try sell there isn't enough liquidity so the price will in return tank. They definetly didn't play their cards smart, I'll agree on that. They have to get in more funds to keep their pyramid going because otherwise they can't continue buying and mine Bcash. If they stop mining it now they ruin their over 1 million Bcash even more, so yeah they are definetly not smart!

@_date: 2018-05-10 16:34:19
Not blaming anyone for anything. It's you who blame Bitcoin for user error. It's like withdrawing $200k then leaving it on the street and then blaming the $ for being stolen.

@_date: 2018-05-10 16:47:09
Now your talking about a different scenario from what I presented. Sure the police can help both crypto theft and fiat theft in some cases, generally not though. When someone steals from your home that's alot different from being burglarized on the street and you walking around with all your wealth on you. User error is user error no matter how you look at it. If you ain't ready to take responsibility and be your own bank then don't do it, but don't blame the tech for your own failure. 
In crypto if someone steals your keys they don't become the legal owner, they will however be in possesion of the funds just lika any other theft.

We should implement an erc-20 so we can buy Bitcoin, one for selling, one for margin, one for backup copy while at it, no?    
Edit: Yes it's the supplier making money of this scam, not the investor.

It could last 0 months or it could last a year or years. I didn't say it was a good or bad financial plan. It all depends on future price and expenses for OP.


Maybe it will, maybe it won't. $11k is alot of money to alot of people even if it may seem insignificant to you or Donald Trump.
@_date: 2019-11-14 21:30:51

@_date: 2019-11-14 23:11:49


And? 


Yes it's very expensive... Spending money on crap depends on what said person considers crap. Decorations etc. I consider not very necessary. I wouldn't personally willingly take a loan if I have money to spend on decorations and entertainment for $1k monthly.


It's not like I have a car myself, please tell me more about car expenses. My car is most likely older and so therefor more prone to failures and more costly in gas. I have to drive for 20 minutes just to get to a super market.


Depends which dude and what options are available obviously. Some people take the bus, some ride a bike, some have the ability to walk, some fly.


I'm sure you think your budget is reasonable. Many people think their own budgeting is reasonable, even if they have huge amounts of debts. You should stick to your budget if you so desire. It's just a little silly when you compare your expenses for a family of 3 towards OP's expenses. Everyone doesn't live in California where everything is overpriced, even though people shit and starve out on the streets. Compare your expenses vs those of Donald Trump and you'll realize it's a pretty shitty comparison.
@_date: 2018-10-08 20:49:57
An item you want to buy is priced at $15. Bitcoin just trippled in $ value in 24 hours. Are you fine with paying $45 of Bitcoin since you don't look up conversion rates even though you could've gotten away with paying one third of your Bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:16:32


Not cheap or even close to average I'd say. Consider moving?


Sounds overpriced.


Why not buy 2 cheap cars? You don't have to borrow money to buy cars, or am I misunderstanding? Of course it's gonna be expensive if you borrow money to buy cars.


actually sounds reasonable.


Seems reasonable.


Seems very expensive.


Can't really tell if normal or expensive.






$1000 in monthly entertainment? I'll provide you with a free link to fake Satoshi, how about that?
Car maintenance lol, didn't you get a loan for 2x cars? All you have to do is keep it clean and change a light once in a while.
Toiletries: cost practically nothing.
Clothing: Well do you need new clothing every month? Buy cheaper clothes?
Furniture: Do you need a new sofa every month to be able to watch tv? I've not bought a single furniture in over 12 months...
You are spending a shit ton of money on crap literally.
Well as long as you're happy I guess. You shouldn't compare your expenses vs the average person though, let alone a single person.
Edit: I live on $11k for a whole year includes rent, car, dog, food, internet, tv, clothes, toiletries, furniture, decorations, car maintenance, gas etc. And I bet my broadband is better than yours, even though I pay less than you do for housing, alot less.
$11k is alot to invest for most people I believe...

@_date: 2018-10-08 21:30:47
Lets be fair it's not unusable. It's still the best mobile wallet. I understand your frustration with it though. I think it's way to early to remove this feature. Switching between Btc/Satoshi/$ until Bitcoin has more adoption (automatically more stable) would in my opinion be the best move.
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:26:47
What a shitty exchange removing only some knockoffs. Remove Bcash first and then we can go after the small scam copies. Who could possibly be willing to pay to get these clones off of the exchange other than a certain Bcash actor?

@_date: 2018-10-08 21:58:11
Elaborate please. Is it stable for you in that sense that 1 Btc is 1 Btc, stable enough that the price swings in fiat doesn't matter to you at all, stable enough that it won't matter if Bitcoin goes to $0 without fiat system dying before or stable enough (for you) so far?
@_date: 2018-10-08 20:18:36
The problem is to remove a good feature before Bitcoin is more stable. Bitcoin is volatile as fuck and I want it to keep being volatile for quite a while. I also agree with removing fiat conversion eventually, key word is eventually.
I understand the incentive to remove it, it's problematic though as now I have to add extra apps to my already slow mobile or look up the conversion elsewhere. Even worse it will be for newbies who don't have a clue what 0.01 or 0.00001 is worth in $ value. Tbh you wouldn't know it either without looking it up as Bitcoin is volatile no matter how you look at it.
I don't think in fiat, I trade altcoins to gain more Bitcoin for example. Until an item people want to buy with is priced in Bitcoin and Bitcoin becomes less volatile it's conversion will always be important. Does every Satoshi count to you? It does to me, so don't tell me I don't think in Bitcoin.
I'll continue using Samourai wallet anyway, just don't agree with this being the right move YET.

Update: "Hello,
I've talked to one of the developers, and there is indeed a bug with the "send all" button. We're working on fixing it asap. Sorry about this. I'll leave it to you to report back to the reddit thread :-)
As for your other questions:
1- Manually set fees: As a general principle, Exodus is designed for a mass audience, and we try to avoid advanced options (such as setting your own fees) as much as possible. However, there is something like this in the works, since this is a highly requested feature.
2- ZCash is currently under evaluation but that doesn't mean it will be added very soon. We will add ZCash after extensive testing so that it satisfies our quality standards so this may take a while. You can follow this link to see the assets we are planning to integrate into Exodus:
Hope that helps. Do stay in touch and let me know if you have any more questions.
All the best!"

I don't have a right to say what I believe the future looks like?
Edit: I hope I'm wrong btw.

I'm not losing sleep over it. That does not mean I don't care about helping the bitcoin community. Besides who paid you to write that nasty comment? You shilling?
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:53:14
What do you mean prove myself? Either bet me or don't? One of us would make money and one would not, its that simple. Besides I never assumed you meant Btc. I did assume you meant s2x however.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:33:01
One priv.key for each pub.key. Think of a postbox it has an adress that anyone can send to (public key) . But to open or use the mail you need the private key. Which wallet are you using? If you can find the private key storing your funds you can import it into electrum for example (desktop wallet). Have you sent funds to more than one adress? If so you need to import more than one.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:55:23
Exodus or Electrum would suit you better
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:01:31
Naw thats just fucked up. I hope he dies slow and horrible for even thinking about it. Would be great if owner found this anon post talking about 70 btc and finding it in his wallet etc. Its not that hard to realise who it is after that.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:59:59
Most likely, but you should store it yourself anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:48:18
* Well there is no reason to stop innovating on Bitcoin, so hopefully never.
*  Everyone wants their tx to arrive as fast as possible. You don't have control of the lightning node? Maybe you should research lightning and what it does.
* I never said the network isn't safe and secure, that would be major problems xD
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:08:07
I'll bet you money or bitcoin w/e you like. Its not going below 1k w/o some major ban.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:50:54
You've invested in something thats a work in progress and you think going over to the attacking side (bch) will help you with fees in the long run? Why do you need it to arrive within a few hours? Send it with low fee and it will arrive when it arrives.
 This technology ain't finished just because you decided to invest in it. Its more important the network is safe and being built upon than just fuck it I'm leaving for a copy that will be taken over by another copy that will make these spammers more money. You wanna give your funds to them? Fine with me.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:16:27

I'm not saying its real or fake. But if its fake why have Bittrex not just shown proof of it being fake? This does affect the faith in their business so they better ignore it /s

No I'm calling b2x developer Jeff Garzik and his gang criminal. Those who bought was victims, however I don't feel sorry for them either.

Why did you not tell me sooner you were gonna buy? I could of shorted ;(
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:13:58
Thats bogus argument. If you trade $10k you wouldn't mind if $100  goes missing? What the fuck? What if these 100's keeps disappearing, you wouldn't mind that either? Soon you'll be back at ZERO with that attitude!

How much money do we give him before we fight back?
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:21:04
It is random, your not supposed to pick words.
You could re-do it if you want to.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:24:56
Because your either against an attack or for it. There can only be ONE bitcoin. I just made this thing called bitcoinpumpcoin would you like to buy? only 0.5 btc each. RETARDED
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:41:14
Well if your dumb enough to pick a side before researching, you kind of deserve whats comming.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:29:19
It does not have to replace fiat to be successful. Being the easiest and most secure way to transact over the internet makes it worth alot anyway. I'm not saying it won't replace fiat, but even if it doesn't you still don't have to exchange it back to fiat unless you want to. I can't think of a good reason unless your gonna spend it right away after on lets say a house and they don't accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:36:57
Your better off buying a cheap usb miner than spending 2 weeks or more on electricity with gpu. But I'm not so sure hashrate will drop either since their miners will either be resold or moved to another country.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:49:05
No. The otherway around unfortunately
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:18:25
Probably. However I can't guarantee its not been tampered with.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:41:10
Of course you need to use an exchange or find someone to buy it from you elsewhere. It will not magically turn itself to fiat.

Thank you so much for sending this along; I really appreciate it! Let's work through this together to figure out what's happening.
As a first step, please try refreshing your BTC wallet: How do I refresh my wallet? Edit: 
The other possibility I'm worried about is unusually high number of inputs causing a problem. Do you have mining rewards being sent to your Exodus wallet?
Let me know and we'll take it from there."
My reply from support, go try it! (did not work for me)
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:20:14
Btw your funds are going to confirm sooner or later. Lots of transactions right now.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:53:39
It will confirm when when the mempool has dropped. Here you can see what it looks like: bitcoinfees.earn.com
It was over 950 Sat/B and down to below 500 Sat/B now.
Edit: Your funds are safe just have to wait.
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:34:08
Haha don't you worry about me :)

It does come up often, hence why whe should actually teach newbies he is NOT trustable and should be listed under KNOWN SCAMMERS ?
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:17:20
Except for holding it on Coinbase. Use your own desktop wallet. The point of bitcoin is being able to be your own bank. Only keep funds on an exchange for selling or buying. If Coinbase gets hacked, your bitcoins are gone.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:56:34
I'm not technical enough to answer on that unfortunately.

Vitalik controls everything in Ethereum with forks left to right, starts defending Roger Ver just after he invested into Eth and defending child porn on twitter. I mean how fucking stupid can you get? 
Well I for one know I ain't giving my precious BTC away to any of these get rich quick schemes. Let the altcoin dumpening begin. Lets call it the flippening :D

You got into bitcoin when it was 8 bucks a piece and your whining over this lame attack thats already started dropping in the mempool. If you've been in bitcoin for so long you would know that we will have minor hiccups on the way, Rome was not built in one day etc. Calm your tits.

How did you know? I thought I was hidden behind this screen :/
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:19:49
Its important to know there is risk involved when using exchanges. However ignoring a problem won't make it go away.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:23:26
I'll admit I didn't know extreme poverty was decreasing. We can obviously increase food supply right now if we wanted to aswell, there is lots of land not being grown on and we can use hydrophonics, led lamps etc. But I don't think it will last forever. Anyway lets go back to talking bitcoin ;). I still hope your right and I'm wrong about the future!
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:56:33
Missed out or thought it was dying? How about you research what Bitcoin is before investing. And not being able to afford a whole Bitcoin is just a dream for many since there will only ever be 21m Bitcoins and some are already lost. Its so stupid investing in something just because its rising in price. Go do your research and then you decide what to do next.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:18:22
In my opinion he is clearly deceiving people on purpose. It shouldn't be that hard to find traces since he leaves them all around him. I may not be the best spokesperson but thats why I made this thread so we can collaborate and hit back where it actually hurts.

You will most likely be able to sell it on coinbase, however how long this will take after fork I have no clue. They will have to split it for you. If you use your own wallet you might be able to split sooner. I would recommend always take it out of coinbase if its a decent amount though.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:39:01
Its probably making it worse? Seriously celebrating is one thing, but 10 threads on main page? Why would you want that?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:55:03
This is indeed very worrying to Vitalik because he is so heavily invested in Bitcoin but not so much in Ethereum. /s

@_date: 2017-11-11 16:22:04
How about Mt.Gox? Luring new people to invest in his own altcoin and calling it bitcoin is definetly not criminal or what?! Have you seen bitcoin.com lately? Or the fact that someone with alot of money is hosting several thousand of nodes behind amazon? Or the fact that someone decides to spamm the bitcoin network with alot of tx to game the market? Maybe you've missed all of this...
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:27:14
I did it on hardware wallet trezor. Otherwise I haven't really researched it. Should be able to import priv. key into some client maybe.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:18:44
Okay so you support that a single group goes in public calling altcoins for bitcoins? I have nothing against altcoins. I do however mind market manipulations... I guess you like when criminals makes money then? Again I have nothing against altcoins... Its the market manipulation I'm talking about...
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:36:45
That is not the only thing they are doing. I could not care less if they decide to jump ship. I'm talking about luring others. Hard to understand the difference?

Tell him to get out of fiat! I'd just be mad if someone tries to give me advice about my investments. If he's so smart why is he not cashing out himself. Oh right he never even invested...So he must know for sure when to invest and when to cashout.
He is most likely the guy who comes in hindsight saying I told you so. But if he's wrong he probably won't ever talk about it again. Besides if you listened to him you would've never even been invested in the first place.
Never listen to what other people say. YOU and only YOU should decide what to do with your investments.

Try looking for "Replace-By-Fee" or "rbf"
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:06:38
Not really, it wasn't even anything he was looking to buy. Just looking through deals. Did OP buy anything for fiat? I don't think so. Either way it makes no difference to Bitcoins value. Bitcoin is still in development and fast tx can be expensive for newcombers during spam attacks, makes more sense after lightning. But neither you or me should tell someone what to do with their money.

* Yeah Bitcoin is a work in progress. As long as people work on it, its in progress. 
* Okay so buy your coffee with something else then. Lightning isn't finished yet and we ain't getting there any quicker because of all the fud and spamming on the blockchain. But the true hodlers will be fine.
* Do the exchanges need to tell you what your investing into or can you do some research yourself?
* If thats what you believe then thats fine with me.

@_date: 2017-11-04 00:18:55
10,000 - current price (7226) = 2774
2774 divided by 7226 = 0.383
0.383 * 100 = 38.3% gain
300+38.3% = $414.9

Your clearly mental. Nothing wrong with that, but go seek help.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:24:26
Not really, everyone can use it as they wish. Thats not what I said though: "I still don't care when you started using bitcoin". But I couldn't care less what you use it for either.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:06:20
I don't know so how would anyone else? It can happen or it won't. I could tell you what I think, but there is no point. You should not rely on others for trading advice imo.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:40:33
Well, its the only way you can know for sure if a transaction is legit or not. You can if you want trust others but the point of bitcoin is you don't have to trust anyone else. It also benefits the whole bitcoin network, Winning!
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:20:48

@_date: 2017-11-14 13:27:49
Yeah and I don't care when you invested. You sound just like Roger Ver, I invested first blah blah blah. You don't even know when I invested. Besides even if you invested first among mortals, that does NOT make you better or smarter than anyone investing later.
Gl with Roger coin, haha you come remind me in 2 years how your investment in bcrashh went. You were probably first to invest in bch so yeah all the more you should own in 2 years.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:30:40
There is a difference. This sub has never condoned a scam knowing it is just that.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:41:17
It will be super easy downloading the blockchain because we keep the blocks small. Its also not that hard to download a program and install on your computer if you don't want to trust anyone else. You can trust one or several 3rd party with crypto (block explorers), but the beauty is you don't have to if you don't want to.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:55:35
Yes. Everyone is having this issue because Roger Ver is pumping out transactions to boost bch and make more money. And whats sad is its always working out for him, every fucking time. But these problems will be resolved. Lightning will come in soon and make the cartel attacks obsolete. Also people will realise only after they got burnt. Losing money is probably the best way to learn. Its just sad its filling Rogers pockets.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:25:31

@_date: 2017-11-17 01:08:56
I think it depends on how many inputs it has so if one input is 250 Byte two inputs would be 500 Byte. So I don't think it matters if you use one wallet with 3 inputs or 3 wallets with one input each. I'm not 100% sure on this. And as mothh9 said don't use this one you uploaded here.

Same for me. Probably a bug!

So how do you get altcoin without transacting bitcoin? If you store more than your going to purchase with in altcoin you lose out on bitcoin profits. Sorry but you make no sense.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:23:26
I've been using it for Btg since mining got activated. My best proof is on Twitter and Facebook. Also people in trollbox writes about these things from time to time. Not really proof of having funds frozen but I do have a picture of how this mod behaved in chat.  Look picture 2! Not really modlike behaviour imo.
Edit: I'm not saying its exit scam, but its very shady and fishy atm.

If you send all funds in one go to one new adress it should count as one input. If you deposit two times it should count as two inputs. I think this is how it is, but I'm not 100% sure. I definetly don't think all previous adresses has anything to do with it, if so the number of inputs would rise indefinetly.

Both Legacy and Segwit are bitcoin adresses. Segwit is a new implementation. You can use either, however segwit will allow you to transact cheaper. For example I'm storing main funds on Legacy for now and use segwit for spending. But you can also store all your funds on a segwit adress. I have not moved mine yet.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:36:59
I feel like celebrating is fine, but we don't need 5-10 threads talking about prices every day. I'd much more prefer real bitcoin news and innovation. Stop upvoting all price threads and upvote just one? Or make sticky for prices?

Okay he is definetly not a gentleman. I don't really agree about him being smart either, perhaps not retarded, but smart? 
He is wasting so much time and money on somthing that will never happen (the flippening). Involving himself with really shady people. If I was such a greedy fuck and in his position I wouldn't go out drinking wine together with fake Satoshi and the rest of them criminals then let someone take a picture and upload it to the internet. Brain malfunction!
Trying to shitsmear the Core team on twitter. Thats like playing with dynamite. Making enemies is probably not that smart. Fucking with the whole Bitcoin community? Can't see where that could go wrong xD
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:44:23
Its better in many ways imo. Try Electrum, then you can RBF if needed and also then you store your priv.keys on your computer. Remember to write down seed. If you have a bigger amount invested you should consider a hardware wallet. (Trezor or Ledger Nano S) Then your funds are safe even if computer has keylogger for example.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:07:10

You can buy or sell to other people on an exchange.

@_date: 2017-11-06 18:08:08
You will most likely be able to sell it on coinbase, however how long this will take after fork I have no clue. They will have to split it for you. If you use your own wallet you might be able to split sooner. I would recommend always take it out of coinbase if its a decent amount though.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:10:15
Segwit just got activated, thats a big reason for the price increase!
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:46:35
The problem only occurs when its to late. I can't see the forest for the threes are in the way. How about working on actually improving bitcoin instead of some knockoff thats only purpose is to steal funds.
Besides its only diluting the whole crypto space with crap. Its a different story if it has majority consensus, this does not. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:39:21

@_date: 2017-11-09 17:30:00
I don't agree with the spending from an altcoin. Bitcoin just got segwit and lightning is coming! However if you wanna use another coin you should choose any but s2x and bch.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:58:00
Yes and there is good reason for it aswell. Maybe you want to have one that you save for a new car etc. But lets say a friend owes you 50 bucks then you give him a specific public key and then you know those 50 came from him because it was sent to that specific public key. Thats how merchant accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:57:04
Yes there is some project in the work for decentralised exchanges. I don't know which one will be a good alternative yet!
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:39:38
But Trezor and Ledger NEVER claimed that BCH or any other altcoin is Bitcoin either... If Trezor and Ledger started saying that Litecoin is Bitcoin I would stay as far away as possible from them aswell.
Edit: I would even call Trezor or Ledger a scam if they said Litecoin is Bitcoin, because thats exactly what it is.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:07:07
Yes its sad. I wish some whale would come in and dump on them already. Maybe some scripts spamming bch blockchain filling their nodes with full 8mb's? How long do you think their nodes would cope? Also if we could short it would be down below 0.1 instantly. Exchanges need to wake up! Are they really this blind? I would freeze Roger Ver's accounts, there is enough proof he is market manipulating since years now..

You can store your bitcoins on either of them.
Segwit is cheaper for transactions (an upgrade to the network). I store main funds on Legacy and spendings on Segwit

Too bad people in general ain't in Bitcoin for the right reasons. Everyone just chases the next money printer, therefor it's a big chance cryptocurrency as a whole will die. If Bitcoin dies, cryptocurrencies will never be taken serious again by the general public. In fact it might even be to late at this stage, time will tell.
Looking at how Eth, Bcash and XRP is top priced currencies it's not looking to good imo. Everything is centralised and even way to many Bitcoin holders decide to hold the Bcash to dilute their own real Bitcoin holdings. That is printing money out of thin air, good luck with that!

Yes that is the point to move your funds to your own personal wallet that you are in control of. Not your keys = not your Bitcoin. If you've got android I would suggest Samourai wallet and when your stack is big enough to justify the price of a hardware wallet you should invest in one of those.

Proof of keys = not storing Bitcoin on exchanges. Not your keys = not your Bitcoin. Instead you move it to your own wallet that you control.

I'll probably end up moving it to my bank eventually and then back to an exchange to buy Bitcoin, or just keep it in my bank account. It's only 15 bucks or around there. I just need to link my bank account back with the PP account. After this I will close it again and hope I'll never have to use their shit ever again :P
@_date: 2019-01-03 02:02:24
You shouldn't buy a hardware wallet unless you have a certain amount of Bitcoin to justify the price of a hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are kind of pricy and you're better of investing in more Bitcoin until that day.
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:18:03
Yes but if you only have say a small amount of Satoshi's you've got tipped from tip bot, then you can withdraw from it and play around a little with LN. So as long as it's only minimal amounts you can try deposits and withdrawals on lightning without setting up LND which isn't suitable for most people yet.
I'm currently trying it out and was able to deposit 10 Satoshi from tippin.me, send back to tippin.me for 0 fee Satoshi, pretty fun to play around with :D

@_date: 2019-01-04 18:30:51
Well I don't agree. This is the simplest way to play around with sending couple Satoshi's from tip bot to wallet and back for example, to be able to try out Lightning. Also you can try recieving funds without actually waiting for someone to open a channel to you or having to send money away to be able to recieve or setup LND which isn't suitable for most people at this stage.
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:13:38
Proof of keys is mainly about withdrawing your funds from exchange to your own wallet that you control. I've got almost everything in my own personal wallet always. I do still have some funds on Binance that I'm looking to trade with however. 
The funds I've got on Binance is definetly not under my control and I know I could lose it, but I'm fine with it as long as it's a minor share of my total holdings. I trust Binance for now. I've got a feeling people over at HitBtc will get hit hard. I've been calling that shit exchange out for ages.
So even though I think you missed what this proof of keys was all about, you already had proof of keys all along, which is a good thing! My advice to you would be to store your hardware wallet at home though, store half (12 words) of your seeds in the deposit box and the other half at home. Use pin code and 25th word (password) along with a decoy password.
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:19:46
If you lose your hardware wallet you'll have a backup consisting of 12-24 words written down on paper and stored somewhere safe. The words will be given to you to write down when you initialise your hardware wallet. 
Leaving funds on Binance/Coinbase could be more safe than storing it on your computer in case of keyloggers/malware, however not recommended to store it on exchanges for long. Not your keys = not your Bitcoin!
You should install a wallet on your phone, phones are pretty damn safe, then send a little out from Binance/Coinbase to your phone to try it out. After you've recieved your small amount to your phone you can move on to withdraw the rest.
You'll get backup seed words to write down on paper when you make a wallet on your phone as well. If you have android I would HIGHLY recommend Samourai wallet! A hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger) would be your best friend for storing securely long term. Go for that if you have an amount big enough that you need to store, enough to justify buying a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:54:56
Yeah I hope SV forces them to eventually change POW. Exchanges will hopefully start delisting in the soon future.
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:43:12
I'm using Samourai wallet and have done so for quite some time now. If you buy the hardware wallet directly from the manufacturer and not from a 3rd party then it will be just fine (Trezor/Ledger). Use Samourai until you've got enough value in Bitcoin to justify a hardware purschase.
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:57:05
The paper wallet method is good for lower amounts or high amounts only if you really know what you're doing. You would use a bootable usb drive, unplug all hard drives, unplug all ethernet connection, printed on a printer that doesn't store data etc.
The "compromised" hardware wallets has mostly or maybe even only been compromised in such a way that the attacker has written down the seed words in advance, then the buyer has deposited into the already generated mnemonic seed without having it generated on his/her own.
Buy directly from the manufacturer, problem solved! I don't get it why people always have to buy from a third party that has had the chance to possibly tamper with the device.
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:53:03
You guys probably don't agree with me, but I think this is the best thing that could happen. Either SV wins and bcash goes to fucking 0 like it was supposed to or if it doesn't and Bitcoin goes down with it, then it was supposed to happen sooner or later. 
If I was mining I would help SV chain destroy ABC ASAP. Bitcoin difficulty will adjust and doesn't need to die because hashpower leaves to defend bcash, and if it does it would happen sooner or later and the crypto experiment is over anyway.
Why would I not help ABC chain? Because Bitmain is THE reason we're in this situation to begin with. They've been mining/attacking Bitcoin chain by mining empty blocks to fill up the mempool. They are the reason bcash has forked and stayed alive for this long, as a fucking shitstain all over cryptocurrency. In return Bitcoin has been stagnating because of this. I SAY FUCK BITMAIN AND BCASH! I rather die with Bitcoin and crypto alltogether.

Hardware wallets gets updates for many different reasons. Could be adding support for new coin, more security features etc. If you've written down the seed, then it doesn't matter if the device wipes, gets stolen or burnt. Trezor usually doesn't wipe, only happened once for me. It could get bricked or be an update requiring wiping of the device though.
Edit: If it gets stolen you should as a precaution move funds to a new wallet with a new seed.
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:41:38
I'm using it with a whopping 27 Satoshi's. I'm also not interested atm in setting up a LND just to send money away to be able to try recieving funds on LN.

It's Bitcoin on steroids, a tip bot for the so called lightning network. 1 Satoshi is the smallest unit of a Bitcoin. The lightning network is quite young technology. For now you could just hodl on to it, or you could tip it to someone else if you feel like it. 1 Bitcoin = 100.000.000 Satoshi. 
Having Bitcoin on lightning is having Bitcoin on a second layer simply explained. It's supposed to be more widely used for small spending in the future for things such as micropayments, tipping, buying coffee etc.
You should keep it here on reddit for now since it's not a big sum and lightning network wallets aren't really user friendly yet for the average consumer.

How come Slush's pool ain't finding any blocks?
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:02:26
If you're looking to spend $100 on LN then you should probably use another wallet then. Bitcoin lightning wallet maybe or run your own node. If I was looking to spend money over LN, I would probably at this point go with BLW or setup my own node. AFAIK the BLW wallet isn't centralised and lets you automatically store the channel states on google. They do have some fees if you want them to help you secure funds also.
Although WOS might gain more info from your purschase. It wouldn't be that much more compared to on chain (I think). As long as you don't show your id or the shop (reciever) gives them the users identity and what you've purschased. Considering input and output on chain is already tracable.
I'm not trying to say this wallet is ideal or anything, just a good extra option at least for now in this early stage, depending on your needs and technical capabilities. I wouldn't store $100 in it either. For me to recieve funds over LN this would be my go to atm. Because I don't feel first spending $100 on lightning to recieve $100 over LN or waiting for someone to open up a channel towards me.
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:19:28
Yes, tippin.me, tip bot you mentioned, I've also found one mobile wallet which will open a small channel for you (Denryu) if you play Sarutobi (mobile game app). In the game you will collect  coins which it will link to your wallet. 
      
     
I don't know if Denryu is legit though. I've tried it and was so far only able to move 10 satoshi's from it to tippin.me. After 2 days or somthing my channel got force closed and now I'm waiting to see if support will fix it.
      
    
However they're all centralised so only good for very small amounts goes without saying.
Edit: Wallet of satoshi you can recieve and send lightning for free (still centralised). If you want to fund it from on chain to the wallet then 0.15% fee.
Probably better wallets if you want to fund it from onchain. I think Bitcoin Lightning Wallet would be cheaper, plus AFAIK you hold the keys and the channel state is automatically uploaded to google.

Easy way to tell we going lower = alts still heavily overpriced. If you can lure someone into investing in bcash then it's not that hard to make them sell low either. Finally we see bcash losers incl. Jihan, Roger, Craig, Calvin lose all their funds because they decided to invest in their own ponzi. I've said it earlier, they're not smart, although some may think they are. 
People who've held from the very beginning and still have access to private keys won't sell at this point. It's new people investing thinking it would be ez lambo hodler and now they panic because they've invested more than they can lose.

Always listen to what strangers or the media tells you to do, or else your SOL. Never sell for higher price than you bought. Always wait until it dropped 50% value or more of what you bought for, then you can sell or even better you can invest in this new ico that got a market cap of several millions of $ just by launching.
Cryptocommunity as a whole is retarded. Every single altcoin is the new BTC, is underpriced compared to BTC. If it's not worth 20%+ of BTC m-cap after launch you'll know it's underpriced.

Electrum is a wallet program that holds your Btc. So you control your Bitcoins and not some 3rd party. There is also safer hardware wallets you can buy that can store your keys/bitcoins. Lookup Trezor and Ledger Nano S. This way you don't have to worry about keyloggers and such.

In the beginning every block found increased the supply with 50 new Bitcoins. Approximately every four years it's halving. Right now the reward (new Btc) from found block is down to 12.5. In year 2020 we will have another halving down to 6.25 and so on. 
Every block takes around 10 minutes to find. If more miners compete the difficulty of finding new blocks will rise and if less miners compete the difficulty of mining would drop.

Increase in adoption would also give Bitcoin more purshasing power per Satoshi. Halving having the same effect, making new Bitcoins more scarce. I can get included in a block usually for 1 Sat/B within a decent amount of time. I may or may not be able to get into next block for 1 Sat/B in 2020 depending on demand for blockspace. 
If we onboard more people while also not increasing capacity for transacting, then the fees will rise. Increase can be done with more Segwit usage, eventually most people will move towards bech32. LN will also reduce demand for onchain transations. So halving doesn't necessarily mean I will have to pay more than 1 Sat/B to get included. Time will tell what happens.

When your transaction has 1 confirm it's safe. A transaction can sometimes be used together with RBF (replace by fee) for convinience. I use it all the time in-case I need to bump the fee up and need my transaction to confirm sooner. AFAIK the RBF also has the ability to change where the UTXO is going, although not very simple and not supported by wallets.
With 1 confirm your funds are very safe, however gets even more safe the more confirms you have. In order to change it or double spend it the attacker would have to attack the whole Bitcoin network. This attack would cost ALOT of money. Attacker would gain more money by mining honestly.

Actually one is enough. What you should have two of is the seed written down on paper or stamped on metal imo.
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:05:58
But the 25th word would create a different wallet depending on what password you choose if I'm not mistaken? Is the password only like a pin, a protection for the device itself? Basically I'll have to burn my paper seed if I want to bring my cryptocurrency with me underground even if I get a strong 25th word passphrase?

It doesn't have to be high. Biggest problem with big drops is new investors get rekt. For them it doesn't matter if Bitcoin has gained x % in the past. They want their investment to store value or purschaing power for themselves also, not just in the past for early adopters.
I don't like it when early adopters keep talking to newcombers to the space about how I've still made x % before you bought so there is nothing wrong with you losing yours. If we want people to adopt cryptocurrency and use it then spreading toxicity or mocking isn't the way forward. We need to be helpful and understanding.

Bitcoin will be used for both... First you create a LN channel and fill it up, then you spend from LN channel whenever you want instantly. After you've purschased what you want to purschase, you buy back the same amount with the paper money you we're gonna spend. You don't have to buy your new LN balance from layer one.
99.9% of altcoins are fucking trash. I can only think of one I actually could have a good use for.

Samourai is a great wallet for on chain, however it doesn't support LN yet.

The best use is to both hodl and use it simultaneously. After you've used it you top it back up if you wish to keep hodling, otherwise you just use it. You don't have to hodl it if you don't want to.

You should tell the media Bitcoin is dead. I'm sure they've never written about that.

Click on "more info" from the lntipbot message above. When you want to know your balance you type a pm to the bot and in body section you type !balance. Also 10 satoshi is minimum tip.

That won't be a problem because I get new ones printed daily ;D
In fact it's so easy to buy fake ones there isn't even a need for the real ones.
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:08:23
Of course people use it. After your done using it you fill your bag back up with the same amount for your paper.

Stay strong handed. You can't become a hodler with weak hands. Right now we dumping off a load off "wannabe hodlers" that thought it would be an easy ride to the Lambo. After we dumped all them off we'll start go up again.

What is backing the price of this cash you're talking about? Is it A: the ability to easily make fake copies looking exactly the same, B: the fact that it could skyrocket in inflation at any point of time, C: it can take days for your payment to arrive or any other good reason?
Isn't paper money the exact definition of imaginary coins contrairy to stuff such as gold, land, real estate and so on?
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:28:36


Because it's the original. As long as the original works as improves, why would you buy a fake copy? Sure some people buy fake gold, fake watches etc. People who want the real thing don't.
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:35:36
So you bought the fake ones, lmfao loser!
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:23:04
No that's not why it's not used. It's not used because:  
1. It's hard to transport.  
2. It's hard to verify.  
3. It's hard to break down into smaller fractions or vice versa.

The AI could help them prevent throwing good money at their own scam. It could also tell them to throw more good money at their own scam. I hope for the latter.

Edit: found the problem: "The tip limits are currently between 10 and 100,000 satoshis."
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:11:56
Yes that I've understood. Just have to call it something. 25th word seemed most fitting to not confuse it with pin. The passphrase is generating a new wallet afaik. I should probably burn my seed even if I use a very strong passphrase to make sure I can bring my cryptocurrency with me underground and no one else can gain access to it. 
On next bull run I'll have to buy some more hardware devices to backup on, cause there is no fucking way I'm letting the gov. or anyone else (besides a certain person) get access to my crypto after I'm dead. I much rather make everyone else's Bitcoins worth alot more :)
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:28:05
I'm desperate? If anyone is desperate it's you searching up Bitcoin subreddit just to spew your hatred. I'm not reaching out to you, I couldn't give a flying fuck if you like your paper "money" better. You keep it, I don't want it. 
  
You don't want Bitcoin or information on what Bitcoin is, so what the fuck is your business here then? you fucking troll, get a life you silly cunt. Don't you have anything better to do than whine on other peoples investment on the internet? That is quite sad tbh.
  
Back to A, it's so easy that anyone can buy it on the internet for low amounts then turn around and sell it to you.
  
B: Yes it can crash and skyrocket at any moment just as your paper money can. Difference is with the paper money you're 100% sure it will crash over time unlike Bitcoin which could either succeed or fail.
  
C: WU isn't decentralised, isn't censorship resistant, isn't good for micropayments etc. I could care less what you are interested in.

R/litecoin, the official wallet you can find on the right column. It's Litecoin Core. Should sync alot faster than Bitcoin Core as well because it doesn't afaik have as big blockchain.

Bitcoin is still pretty damn new and has been volatile all it's lifetime. I'm good with the prices going even lower, bring it the fuck on. Has to  make big dump before huge pump. Go put up a short, put your money where your mouth is.
