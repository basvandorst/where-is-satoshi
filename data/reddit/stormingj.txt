You can count me as one. There are times where my own line blurs between libertarian and liberal but I would still consider myself the former and a heavy supporter of UBI. In a future where AI and robotics are going to destroy the entire idea of our current economy it's an necessity.

Only if you bought high and sold low. Hold like a smart person and BTC may still end up being the best choice you'll ever make.

That tweet strikes me as... kind of misleading. tx fees exist sure but right now they're very small because they're offset against the discovery of new coins. In about 100 years when they stop being produced this could be  more of an issue but I read somewhere that increasing tx fees to 2% would be enough to cover that, which is actually competitive compared to many rates for card processing with the added benefit of no refunds or anything.
The fee is always going to be based off a % of a coin and thus proportional to how much of a % Fiat you're effectively sending, so it's also sort of straight up false.

If you wanted to move $10,000 at once yes, but a bitcoin is divisible into 100,000,000 Satoshi. You're comparing bitcoin fee's to moving your own money between banks but it's not really mean to replace currency (bitcoin at least other crypto is a different situation). It's more about the bigger picture of global decentralised finance movement, a theoretical 2% fee a century from now is a bargain for that.

Thanks for the input. At least at 1mb a block it should be easy enough to account for a year or until a decision is made.

Side topic here, how complicated would it be to also use something like this as a media NAS device? As far as I can tell as you'd need is the bandwidth and storage space and it shouldn't be an issue, right? May as well kill 2 birds with one stone.

I just wanted to thank you for doing this ama, it's so refreshing to read because while I don't strictly agree with you politically I firmly agree with your ideals. Too much of the political discussion has become a game on name calling and actively prevents me from trying to explore and understand different perspectives. Where can I buy you  hat? 
@_date: 2017-02-14 10:24:14
I wouldn't advise this for anyone else but 100%. This is because of my very specific situation (lowish savings, completely and utterly stable situation where I won't need access to any emergency money, young age allowing me to rebuild from a potential failure over the rest of my life). This is unquestionably a large gamble, but I've done my research and I'm confident in my conclusion, and prepared to lose it all. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 11:54:32
Certainly, an interesting perspective, while I don't personally agree I can follow your chain of thought and reasoning. I'm just going to discuss one element of it all that isn't speculation, you noted the price not increasing but how are you measuring this? By any reasonable measurement, the price of bitcoin has risen steadily and has continued to do so for years and as far as I can tell has no noticeable signs of slowdown. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 13:58:02
Here are what I consider the key points for such a thing to happen. This list isn't exhaustive and not all required, but each thing happening would have a distinct and noticeable effect on the price:
1) Wider, increasingly positive public perception of Bitcoin. 
By now, most people have heard of bitcoin in some capacity but still only a very, very minute fraction of people own any. As time goes on and more people here about bitcoin and form a positive opinion about it the more demand there is going to be from the public. This leads me to part 2. 
2) Lower barrier entry to buying bitcoin.
As is, there are a few simple ways to buy bitcoin such as p2p via localbitcoins, bittylicious etc. but I would go so far as to say there's no fantastic solution to quickly and easily buy bitcoins for your average person. I don't really have a how here, but if someone worked it out that would help with the above point and make it easier to satisfy the demand of your average person. 
3) Wider acceptance of bitcoin as an alternative payment method. 
This one is a no-brainer and it's already happening. I don't really need to explain much here, as it becomes easier to buy and spend bitcoin the price will continue to rise because volume will continue to climb. 
4) The scarcity of new bitcoins. 
I would hope if you're at all invested in bitcoin you're aware of how the production of new bitcoins works. If you aren't here's a brief TL:DR, fewer bitcoins are produced as time goes on at an exponential rate. Over 75% of the total amount of bitcoin that will every exist have already been created since 2009. The remaining 25% will take over 100 years to finish mining. This is supply and demand 101. 
There are undoubtedly other factors which could help drive such a spike (I didn't even touch the potential ETF approval but that falls under multiple of the above categories), but the above are some simple and easy to understand reasons why the price of bitcoin will unquestionably continue to grow in the future. Barring some large catastrophe (which is an entirely different discussion for another post) $10,000 isn't so much a pipe dream but an inevitability.

Active watching is different from active investing. Reallocating funds to underperforming assets is exactly why you do so, to diversify your portfolio and reduce risk. No asset is always going to perform the best and buying underperforming assets while they're cheap is a fantastic way to hedge your bets.

That's a very short-term view when talking about investing in Bitcoin. Anyone who's really talking about investing should be talking for a minimum period of at least another 5 years if not longer.

Yes in India, the world's largest market for gold. The rest of the world is basically over it already since it has little to no inherent value. It could be that in India gold remains a larger niche but everyone else has already started to move on. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 10:50:26
Is that possible? I suppose yes, basically anything is with bitcoin. Do I think it's likely? No. Bitcoin's market cap is over $16 billion, while there are certainly some large whales, some who could cause a noticeable impact, the only one I believe could cause such a problem as to completely destroy bitcoin would likely be Satoshi. Even despite this, I suspect the community may be trusting enough to capitalise by reinvesting while cheap then to abandon it completely. 
Fear is absolutely a powerful influence but as time goes on and people gain trust in bitcoin it becomes increasingly resistant to it. I'd really love to link or calculate the direct numbers (I don't have them to hand and can't remember exactly where I saw them explained) but we've recently seen a great example of this, every time the PBoC has begun messing with Chinese exchanges we've seen the price drop because of it. The first of these was quite noticeable, the second less so and the third even less. While at first, the markets feared their interference they quickly wised up to what was happening and became resilient to it. While it's certainly possible that something may come along to cause significant fear and shake the market, the most likely being a hard fork or strong government crackdowns, I still believe the overall odds of these events to be low given the existing evidence (Mass SegWit looks far more likely than a hard fork IMO and most world governments appear to be actively not against bitcoin). 
Bitcoin is unquestionably still in its infancy and may not survive but I personally believe in its potential.

I think you're probably right. Are there any exchanges with lower card fees just in USD/Euro? I have a Revolut card which will give me better exchange rates without the SEPA fee but that wouldn't only be worth it if I could find a card deposit with even lower fees. 
Edit: I did some double checking and I think you're probably 100% right Kraken is trading at something like £20 lower than the cheapest in £s so even with a 2.5 fee and a low exchange fee it's almost certainly a better value.

The miners. $100k is not an unrealistic lifetime goal if no catastrophe occurs.

I can't agree with this because the market price does not reflect confidence of success. If the market truly believed it would pass there's no reason the price wouldn't have already started adjusting to the expected volume of new money. If the market was even betting on a reasonable chance of success (many reports say at least 25%) we would still see a price higher than the current one and well above the ATH. I think all of this is indicating one of two things:
1) The market price does not reflect confidence in ETF approval
2) The market price is currently reflecting the proportionally % of either outcome with a predicted severe (&lt;$500) price collapse if rejected.
It would be naive to say such a collapse is impossible but it's certainly looking unlikely. Don't let the Reddit hopeium blind you, that market doesn't think it's going to happen.

Exactly because so few people are using segwit, literally what BashCo is suggesting we improve by increasing adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:53:29
This argument is ridiculous. You can't say segwit doesn't work when people are still paying high fees because they aren't using it. Those who actually bothered tell a much different story. 
Unfortunately, another conversation I had on this topic was lost to the slack-hole but one user said his business was saving 75% on tx fees by making the switch. 
Don't be a tool.

Was it really? I read every single piece of feedback that was submitted and they were not only overly positive and in support of the ETF but as far as I can recall not a single one was in objection for the point it was ultimately rejected for, being an unregulated market and subject to manipulation.

Look I have no interest in your narrative, my point is simply the BU support is neither dead nor gone, and any opinion otherwise is probably wrong.

My only objection to your interpretation is it doesn't account for the part where he proved in private to Gavin who did believe him before Craig objected to proving it definitively in public later. There are too many people in the story who truly believed Craig to be Satoshi before the later controversy for me to really believe they were all played as fools and I feel like I agree with the authors ultimate conclusion, he very likely did have a part of being 'Satoshi' but was not the only person behind the moniker.
