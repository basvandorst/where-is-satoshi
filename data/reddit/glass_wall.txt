Yeah ok, that's 20 times what I was paying last year for transactions

OrSomeone has to watch your channel for you and make sure that if that happens, a newer transaction is posted before it confirms.
Presumably there will be company's offering this service. Hopefully trustworthy ones who won't let the scam happen for a chunk of the profit.

Assuming each node performs 340 (or 680?) transactions per individual before closing and there are no transactions that aren't using the lightning network... yeah I can see that being possible.
I wouldn't bet on it, but the dream exists.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:10:22


Less than what and for whom?
If I'm selling things it currently costs me nothing to accept a payment in bitcoin from a new customer... It costs the customer around $10 in fees, or a couple pennies if they're using an altcoin. But they eat those fees and I just get what I charge.
But to accept a lightning transaction from a new customer that I don't have an open channel with I need to pay around $10 in fees to open the channel and preload it with $10 in fees to eventually close the channel. 
That's $20 just to accept my first payment. And then I need to leave those funds sitting on the network for months. Whereas is I accept BTC or an altcoin directly I can immediately convert it into USD DGE or whatever currency I use to pay my bills or buy supplies.
What incentive do I have to set up and accept lightning payments?

Although if the fees increase after a year your withdrawal transaction may never confirm. As you've set the fee at the creation of the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:31:31


That's just patently wrong and silly to boot.
You need to specify a closing date upon creating the channel.
And you need to include the fee at the time of creation for the closing transaction.
And each time you make a LN transaction using that channel you need to move the closing date closer by a small amount.
Even if it wasn't completely impossible to do, creating a channel that cannot close means that all the coins on your lightning channel can never be redeemed.
Doing business with you would be like buying gold bonds if the gold bonds couldn't be turned in for gold.

@_date: 2018-01-15 16:53:00
So the plan is to increase the blocksize when LN goes live to create the illusion that it's lessening the load? That's actually pretty clever and might help it take off!

The man asked about fees when closing a channel.

My "angle" is that lightning nodes on the testnet do not represent lightning nodes on the mainnet. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:56:40
So why make a lightning network?
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:28:07


Pure speculation that not only assumes that LN has been fully adopted by bitcoin users, but also that bitcoin attains market dominance more than ten times its current level.


Which is currently over $10. For $10 you can send over 1,000 bch transactions or receive an infinite amount of them. 
You'd have to make 1,000 transactions on a LN channel to break even an be willing to wait for months to convert money that you'd otherwise have full ownership over instantly.
And why are you leaving out the opening transaction? Oh yeah, make that 2,000 transactions.


You can't alleviate a load that doesn't exist yet. Who is using bitcoin for daily purchases? How many transactions have you made this year?
You can open a channel and start making 2,000 transactions but if you weren't making 2,000 transactions before LN  then you're not taking them off the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:57:36
Precisely. PIA costs like 45$ a year, nobody in their right mind is making $45 purchases with bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:52:15
I think everyone else will think the same thing and it'll be DOA.
It's got to be very widely adopted before it would be worth using for me.
And if everyone thinks that, it will never be useful.
Granted, the same applies to bitcoin. If nobody wants it, it's worthless. But at least I didn't have to invest $25 just to experiment with bitcoin. Lightning network is gonna require you to pay a hefty transaction fee just to experiment.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:49:30
Except those 6 transactions are currently over $10 a pop, meaning you would need to make over 4,000, transactions with those channels to break even with BCH fees... 
How many times have you spent bitcoin so far this year? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:21:14
How about a 20% fee for a $10 transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:26:52


More than 4 if the person you're selling to doesn't want to eat the fees.
Remember, with lightning it costs money to *receive* a payment. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:32:57
These are transactions taking place on the bitcoin blockchain.
The fees are whatever they are at the time. You can find the current fee here: 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:31:24


Then there would have to be a minimum one day delay to withdraw your funds from the lightning network.

@_date: 2018-01-13 21:38:02
You need to include the fee used to close the channel when you create it. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:29:53


Sans the fees. Which it's more like $5 than $1.
And you pay it to open AND close, so probably $10 to open and then close the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:27:08
There are two parties in every transaction.
The buyer and the seller. Let's compare fees:
I send bitcoin directly to Bob:  
1 on chain transaction.
I open a channel with Bob, send him money, we close the channel: 
4 on chain transaction. One for me to open the channel, one for Bob to open the channel, one for me to close the channel and one for Bob to close the channel.
So unless I'm planning on having at least 4 transactions with Bob on the lightning network, it would be cheaper to do the transactions on chain.
Are you assuming Bob will eat the fee for opening a channel and not pass that cost on to me? What's Bob's incentive? He's used to receiving bitcoin and not paying a fee. Unless the fees are significantly lower, in which case why use lightning at all?
And are you planning to fund your lightning channels directly from your safe wallet? That's a terrible idea. More likely you should transfer from your safe to a spending wallet and then to a lightning channel. But then that's another fee.
How does the existence of lightning channels remove the need for a safe wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:53:06
Don't you have to include the cost of the fee you'll eventually use to close the channel in your original deposit?
You're paying the closing fee on creation.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:41:24
It just requires those 675 individuals who have test nodes, who created them for free to test, to invest two transaction fees per node and do it again on the mainnet.
I'm willing to do things for free that I'm not willing to do for a price.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:58:51
That might work as long as the people you're doing business with don't mind potentially having to pay a fee big enough to confirm 3 transactions to withdraw their funds.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:14:10
So what if I open a channel with Amazon and put a big ole bitcoin in there because I buy everything on Amazon. Then I top it off with a few mbtc from Flakey Franny. Flakey Franny then decides to close our open channel because she wants to invest in dogecoin instead.
What happens? Does my big channel with Amazon close and need to be reopened requiring an additional on chain transaction fee?
Or do only the few mbtc I got from franny get broadcasted? In which case who pays the fee? Me? But the fee might be more than the balance... And Franny won't care if I get dust.

Bitcoin has never been unusable before.
The price has gone through roller coasters. But it was always a functioning currency. The currency of the internet" cannot be used as currency. 
THE COIN ISN'T WORKING. That's a big fucking deal. How can you expect this topic not to dominate the sub?
If WOW suddenly has 30 seconds of lag on every server you can bet your nuts that the sub isn't gonna be silent on the issue.
If Teslas suddenly can only go 4 miles per hour you can bet their subs are gonna be filled with people desperately trying to fix their cars.
The fact that bitcoin is facing a crippling issue that breaks it's key purpose and you expect everyone to just shut up and wait an unknown number of months for a possible bandaid is absurd.

There are a lot of BTC zealots here who want to pretend that BCH doesn't exist. So any exchange that reminds them it exists by having a "buy BCH" button is heresy and must be purged.
Two days ago coinbase rolled out BCH support, but that seemed like good news for BCH, so all the news about it was downvoted away from the front page. So BTC zealots didn't hear about it in time to sell their BCH before coinbase temporarily disabled BCH trading. 
So now they're stuck with that evil enemy coin in their coinbase account for an entire day, assaulting their minds with it's 50% price increase and reminding them that there is a fork out there that has none of the problems they're waiting for months to be fixed by the Holy Lightning Network.
Cleary the solution is to burn coinbase to the ground.
Also maybe coinbase employees made some money in the transition or something.

Unless lightning drastically brings the fees down for on chain transactions. Using altcoins for one-off small transactions will still be vastly cheaper and easier.
Just transferring a few hundred bucks to the lightning network will cost over $20 in fees. Sure you can move them around after that for a pittance, but even if it's free you'd have to use that few hundred dollars in over 400 transactions to break even with bch or litecoins $0.05 fees.

If your salary is paid in bitcoin that's $20-50 taken from every paycheck.
Unless you get paid on the lightning network in which case your employer has to pay $20-50 every paycheck unless he's loaded enough money into his channel to pay EVERY employee for an entire year in advance. . . A business can do better things with that kind of cash on hand than hang onto it for months.
