It is infinitly frustrating when people try to advise you on subjects it is woefully evident you have more knowledge and understanding of. I don't mind the concern, but when it tramsforms into them talking to you like they know more thsn you do..... Balls to that.

And Substratum is the real occupy the internet.

This is an elaborate scam. Don't fall for it.

Thanks dude, appreciated. ��

As another comment mentioned, Blockchain is just a fancy (slower) database. A closed Blockchain is borderline useless, which is what the majority of major corporations think they want.
The trick is having an open blockchain. What do you need for an open Blockchain? Cryptocurrency. Blockchain without cryptocurrency is like a saddle without a horse.

This is applicable only for the early days of Bitcoin. It is safe to say several Million worth of coins have been lost through death or losing wallet access. 
Now that Bitcoin has reached unprecendted heights, anyone with a significant amount of coins would usually have some sort of plan in place to ensure their loved ones have access to their wallets in case of their untimely demise.
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

Lol, stop scaring him off everyone. It could very easily double. You'll survive without the $300 smack-a-roonies. Just hold onto her and see where she goes in a few months/a year.

There has already been two Bitcoin documentaries.
The first one is the type of things you're talking about. Pretty good watch. It's called The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin. It came out a few years ago.
The more recent one is called Banking on Bitcoin and it was released last year I believe.

Good thing Substratum removes control from ISPs and governments alike.

It most certainly does matter. It is indicative of the tactics the corporation is using to continue their stronghold on the financial sector going into the crypto currency age. It is also further proof of manipulation for those that believed the statements referring to Bitcoin as a fraud. 
I think the importance of this has been extremely understated and has been reduced to a few idiotic memes.
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:09:05
So you're suggesting there is a degree of volatility to it? :P I think I'm used to it. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:14:18
I believe there was a few reasons. Ark holders have incentive to hold onto their coins as the more coins you hold, the more additional coins you receive through your elected delegate.
Ark isn't listed on too many exchanges so it managed to avoid the drama that was happening on the Chinese exchanges. 
Most importantly, there is big things coming up in the Ark road map that holders know will drastically increase the value of their coins. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:50:46
What did I do? lol
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:15:57
I actually used my Bitcoin to buy it. As I said, it seems legit so far, been a few months and can withdraw as I please. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:33:55
That is hilarious and should probably used as a marketing term. Mainstream appeal the fuck
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:59:08
I personally feel investing in an altcoin such as Ark would yield a bigger ROI for investments around the $60 mark.
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:44:07
Is there any exchange you recommend? I usually go by CoinGecko
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:50:25
Supposedly we will receive the same amount of Bitcoin Gold that we have in BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:55:15
For a smaller investement such as €100 I would recommend altcoins. You can then use the profit made on them to invest larger amounts in Bitcoin.

Actually it was posted after a crash while the value was starting to reach unprecedented levels. It was posted as a humorous response to everyone who insulted the post maker for not selling his coins before the crash.
That is why it caught on - the guy hodle'd despite events suggesting to do otherwise. While the word has been bastardized over time, I believe the original meaning was intended as encouragement through the bad times, to hold onto your coins, which in turn worked out quite well for everyone who did.
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:10:26
Hopefully it works out for you in the long run too. If we could be sure that it'll still be open in 5 years, I'm sure we'd be investing a lot more.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:12:09
While that is how I would like this to play out, unfortunately I believe that rather than putting the banks out of business, the banks will transition to the blockchain technology themselves. They will do everything they can to create a coin we want to have but it will of course be centralized, giving them the power once again.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:37:51
You can guarantee that you will get a lot of sellouts working for freedoms enemy.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:44:02
I would support this if I had one.
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:37:29
People actually Google how to buy Gold? Does anybody else find that crazy?
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:05:21
I thought it was hilarious that you posted this.... it is even funnier that someone has gone ahead and done it. It's times like this you re-appreciate the internet.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:26:10
He purposely spelt it wrong. How does everyone use the term yet nobody realizes this :/
It was a sarcastic post.
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:01:18
An ETF.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:21:42
Maybe when the price drops signifigantly after the fork. Do not buy them now.
@_date: 2018-07-30 03:46:22
It's gonna rain down $
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:24:05
Well assuming it doesn't close down I will of doubled the Bitcoin invested in around 10 months so I appreciate your misplaced sympathy but no thank you. Hodl'ing with interest.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:19:36
For smaller investements such as €30 I always recommend going for an Alt coin as you stand to gain more. I would personally recommend ChainLink but this is totally your choice.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:25:11
Is it just me or is that hilariously empty with over 8,000+ subscribers? 
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:02:15
This was the confirmation I was looking for that I've made a sound financial decision.
@_date: 2018-04-08 11:17:25
1. Bitcoin is not what was initially conceptualized. It is centralized, traceable and slow.
2. While it may pump before anything else, it yields the least potential for crazy gains of the projects I'm interested in.
3. I like to be different, haha.
The reasons for someone holding Bitcoin are certainly understandable. However I feel that due to the massive change in the fundamentals of Bitcoin in recent years; an investement in it should not be considered in the same light it once was.
Bring on the hate.
