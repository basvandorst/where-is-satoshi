I'm not a fan of some of our writers, but we do have some good ones. I myself used to write for Bitcoin Magazine before they forbade editorials and stopped paying for a couple months. My articles have been well-cited on the Internet and in bank reports
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:29:49
That's different than what you said before, which was that NewsBTC publishes nothing worth looking at whatsoever.
I decided to start contributing to NewsBTC because they allow writers creative freedom. Bitcoin Magazine and CoinDesk are clearly controlled by an investor who dislikes certain topics, judging from how they filter articles and PRs. I refuse to be a part of that, and if you wanna franchise with CoinTelegraph, that'll cost you $7,000 USD.

You're forgetting a crucial problem: all connections in the meshnet are direct. Are you going to lay a new cable line every single time a new node comes online, and dig the cable up when that node moves? Otherwise, you need to connect to a central hub that handles this for you, which would be the same centralized Internet system we have today.

Warren Buffet also said you should only invest in things you're an expert at. Warren Buffet is a self-proclaimed total noob when it comes to technology. Bill Gates is not, and he recognizes the potential of Bitcoin.

There's an existing Bitcoin Co-op headquarted in Vancouver, Canada, that's been responsible for quite a few outreach projects. We haven't yet planned how to decentralize + automate it, but the standard Co-op charter asks Co-ops to work together if you wanna check it out:

We've been running a grassroots-level Bitcoin outreach campaign in Canada for a year, now, and it has proven quite successful. Maybe instead of coming up North to plaster their face across the local community's accomplishments, they should help us out with funding and volunteers. We're holding Vancouver together with a nonexistent budget.

Yes, CoinFest is unable to handle fiat, so he was required to take care of shipping for us. Payment was made via Bitcoin.

We do volunteer our time for Bitcoin advocacy. You guys are the ones treating it like a for-profit job. The rest of us don't get paid for our efforts--here in Vancouver, we bought dozens of tablets and gave them away using our own money, and not a dime of help came from the Foundation.
All attempts at partnership were completely ignored, and we made quite a few. Are you suggesting that if I try again, we won't be ignored? It takes time to send all those emails, you know. And we have day jobs

The Canada Post warned us that our ATM might have trouble reaching Botswana, but we had no idea. There is corruption in their mail system, and we were worried we'd have to go there and break some legs. Bitcoin always prevails!

"CoinFest 2015 was a stunning success, taking Canada’s crypto holiday to countries around the world. CoinFest 2016 is building on that momentum, preparing a series of events for April with with over a dozen cities already participating.
They will commence April 5–the rumored birthday of Satoshi Nakomoto–and conclude with the end of the weekend on Sunday April 10. Stay tuned for more information!"

You're obviously ignorant on the subject, and I'm happy to educate: ICOs do NOT violate security laws. They only require regulation if the coin being initially offered is backed by equity in a company, in which case that's an investment the SEC wants to be involved in.
Cryptocurrencies like AMPs and Factoids don't do that. They are tokens redeemable for a service provided by a decentralized application. It is analogous to preselling a good or service, and I don't think we should stop using a technical term correctly because SOME people don't understand it.
TLDR: your FUD is demonstrable nonsense

read carefully noob. "bitcoins or Bitcoin" for the pural is fine. If I asked you to "send me some Bitcoin," you might send me more than one. You might also send me less than one.
Bitcoin is also used when referring to the network, depending upon context.

CoinFest chose to give the ATM to Alakanani because of her great ambition and personal character. Another article will come out soon with more information, and will mention Alah and others; the details of our project in Africa are currently being finalized.

I'm writer "Andrew Wagner" on the site, and I can say for sure that all of our writers' names are real. I agree that some of our writers need to improve the quality of their work, but some of us are doing a good job. I've written groundbreaking new thoughts on DAOs and the proof of existence concept that didn't go mainstream in our industry until later.
The reason I write for NewsBTC is that there is an upside to their tendency to let articles slip through the cracks: NewsBTC gives its writers creative freedom. I quit Bitcoin Magazine because I was forbidden to write about certain things. Brave New Coin censored me heavily. Coin Telegraph was just milking me and others for free content.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:31:44
That regulates securities and futures, and possibly commodities. Factoids are clearly none of those things. The ICO is legal in Canada, where I actually reside.

To our knowledge theirs was lost to shipping. We were warned this might happen to us, as well, because Africa can be like that. We hope to get photographic confirmation of ours' safety soon

You can still speculate on the usefulness of the access token, but it's not an equity investment in a company or other financial entity, right. That would be illegal.
