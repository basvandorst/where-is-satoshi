Hi Pineapple,
Fantastic news, greatly appreciate all you're doing to held aid charities. Will I hear some kind of news regarding my charity I support? The founder put in an application but hasn't heard back yet, thanks!

I use BespokeCoin.co.uk - One to one personal service, takes the hassle out of it all.

They've had weeks to disclose this and all we know is that only 10% is paid on the 2nd and the rest to follow, but when is another story...

If you visit my office in person within the UK we can sell you that amount. KYC and all that.

I like CoinCorp and I do like your suggestion of CoinMint but both domains are taken! :(
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:51:41
Ok I will put that into the hat :)

Yes it's possible to withdraw from your GBP Wallet.
But what you'll find out is they convert your GBP to EUR when transferring it, and your bank converts it back to GBP.
You lose out twice on conversion rates. I lost about £500 from a 20k withdrawal.
(I also lost money when depositing to Bitstamp's Euro account. I sent 20k GBP, they received it in EURO, I needed the money, called it back and lost out about £1300 on that one, wasn't a good week lol)

Just be careful there are a lot of people out there that will help you and possibly steal from you in the future.

Give them a call mate, usually quite helpful on the phone

$300 a day? You mean $9...

I do like the name 'CoinCorp' but not too sure how it'd be with the banks.

Okay thanks. Will this appropriate if I want to keep my coins private? The only reason I'm looking for co storage is because I don't want my wallet being shared with the government. Because companies like coinbase share info with them. Thanks

But if somebody sends me 1 bitcoin to my Trezor Bitcoin Address, how does the offline usb wallet know it has 1 coin without plugging it in and updating it? 
Do I need to plug it in to update it's balance that people may have sent money to?
I understand the web will know that but doesn't that defeat the whole principle of an offline wallet?

If I buy a trezor, can I set my nicehash miner worker address to the trezor bitcoin wallet address?
If so, how does it update the Trezor offline wallet balance if I don't plug it in? Or do I need to plug it in to update it's balance that people may have sent money to?
