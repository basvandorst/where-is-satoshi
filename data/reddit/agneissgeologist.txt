I completely understand that point of view even if I disagree with it. 
I don't know of a single person that views social security as any form of retirement plan so it's hard for me to believe your premise that SS is a primary reason why they don't save. Personally I think it's a combination of short sightedness, lack of fiscal education, and a result of higher cost of living with stagnant wages.

Here's the weird thing; I don't think I'm in a bubble. I come from liberal, wealthy parents in a major city's suburb and now I live in a more rural area working in construction. I've seen several extremes in political views, wealth, blue/white collar, and education level. I have friends with a PhD and coworkers making just above minimum wage pouring concrete. Maybe the only demographic I have no knowledge of are people in thier 30's to 50's (most of the people I know are millenials or a couple years from retirement) Some save, most don't but no one seems to be reliant on social security. The don't even think about it; if anything a 401K seems to be the fallback plan even though they don't contribute nearly enough.

It's all about what you believe the role of the government should be. At what point should our collective simply let someone fail due to their own bad choices? Sounds like you lean more libertarian and I get why. Personally I came from that direction but I'm starting to get convinced otherwise. 
And how do you think those dormitories would be funded? Taxes; might as well just keep paying SS unless you are arguing that it would cost less.

250k is more than I've ever spent or owned my whole life. Just for perspective, that's ten years of my pay. 
A smart and restrained fiscal plan with 250k and any decent relaxed job would set you for the rest of your life. Maybe not a full retirement, but plenty of money to not have to work to live.

I'm going to pretend the insult was unintended. I keep my expenses small and make smart decisions. Minus taxes, saving, and investing I live comfortably on around 15k a year.

Just bought my first on coinbase, happy to be a part of it. I kinda wish I had pulled the trigger a few years ago when one of my friends talked about it. Better late than never right?? Right guys? 
Anyways, only 50$ in atm so im low risk

Hold up, I have an idea. What if me and my homies all pitched in to buy a safe for the entire neighborhood. Then we could make joint loan decisions to other members of the community. It would be... like a union..... of credit.... and banking.

Wow maybe we should create guidelines so this doesn't happen again and put limits on how much the community has to hold in reserve in case people really need their money.
