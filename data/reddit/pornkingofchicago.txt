What if I sell WoW gold on EBay?
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:50:18
But if I never move my crypto into a wallet and let it sit on an exchange, I don’t actually own it, do I?
That’s what I constantly read on here and one of the main reasons people suggest others to get a wallet.
How can I be taxed on something I don’t own?

If you live in a state where weed is illegal maybe... but crypto isn’t illegal.  So it’s like paying a bill using all pennies and the place not accepting the payment, not because pennies are illegal tender, but simply because they don’t want to...
Or another analogy would be a retail establishment only accepting cash payments, no credit cards or checks...

Shit...I just bought rare mount on WoW for 10k gold and resold it for 20k gold.  How do I report this on my taxes?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:17:51

So Bitcoin is the MySpace of crypto?

Tell them you can’t pay your credit card bill because all your money is in crypto and you can’t get it out because of them, so you have no way to pay them because of their own doing

It’s more like changing $78 Australian dollars for $100 USD.  Did I just make a $22 profit?  No, because the exchange rate is $0.78 AUSD to $1 USD...

I’m not at all an expert but has the same question as you which was answered so I think I understand this point.
Think of your bitcoin as a chunk of gold.  If you have one ounce of gold in your hand (not on an exchange like Coinbase) lets say that ounce of gold is worth $100...   now you wake up tomorrow and check the market and see that the price of gold is now worth $200/ounce. That ounce of gold (bitcoin) rose in price w/o it being connected to an exchange...  it could as easily gone down in price also...
Now, if you want to sell that ounce of gold, you need to put that back on the exchange.

Yet crypto wouldn’t be where it is today without it.
New investors need it to purchase their first cryptos.
When BTC hit 10k USD people weren’t cashing it out for fairy dust, they were cashing it out for fiat.
@_date: 2018-10-03 22:41:52
And yet bitcoin is still at 6k...
