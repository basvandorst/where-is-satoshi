So you've only invested in paypal like database tokens that have no decentralised consensus mechanism (or at best, highly experimental and unproven mechanisms). Congrats, you missed out on the crypto currency revolution.
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:19:42
Hmm, thats not how I see it. Cash means you pay with something of value, directly to the other party. No trusted intermediaries. Any other form or payment (debit/credit card/paypal etc) always involves a trusted third party to settle the transaction. And for electronic payments, this was always a requirement until satoshi published his whitepaper.
Bitcoin isnt all that anonymous, but it does completely remove the third party. In that sense, it is "cash". Just using the equivalent of marked or numbered dollar bills ;).
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:23:03


If by "backed", you mean owned; how do you prevent stupid people from buying bitcoin? Would you even want to?
Fact is, the current fiat valuation of bitcoin (and ethereum) is to a very large extent determined by the same people who are buying tron, bitconnect or that dentist co(i)n. They don't understand crypto, they make no distinction between secure proven decentralised blockchains, database tokens, whitepaper tokens or shitcoins. They will buy or sell based on the size of the unit of account, the price chart of the past 3 days, the number of subreddit subscribers or rumours in the news in a country on a different continent. So be it. It changes nothing about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:33:30
Its still experimental, tests are ungoing. You also have to fund a channel, which is like moving bitcoins from cold storage to an online spending wallet. Channels need to be closed at some point, which involves a second onchain transaction which incurs fairly high fees (much like moving your btc from a spending wallet back to cold storage). Lastly, we have yet to find out how it will scale and how routing will work on a large scale. I dont see LN as a magic silver bullet, but it definitely is a potential game changer.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:36:35


There is no evidence for that and saying it doesnt make it true. Show me the data about the number of users, the overall demand for bitcoin block space, the price elasticity. AFAICS, empty/free block space will be filled with spam while for valuable transactions, people will still be willing to bid the same tx fees they are today. 


Being able to do your own tx verification ensures you remain a peer in a peer 2 peer network rather than a slave in a master/slave network.

craig wright would not approve.
But I do :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:21:56
So you want larger blocks, assuming that would even help with tx fees, so people will keep buying bitcoin to be able to swap them for alt/shitcoins, because that pushes up the price? Yeah, not a compelling argument for me. 
Scaling is a problem, and we need to find solutions. But as long as we havent solved it, I can think of better ways to use the scarce blockchain space. 
I also think this focus on market price is poisonous. Bitcoin is what it is, with its strengths and its limitations. Let it be valued based on that, and on expectations of future solutions. Not trying to inflate bubbles on false promises or questionable usecases.
All that said; lightning network is probably a workable solution for this particular problem, and vice versa, transferring between exchanges (centralised or decentralised) is probably the ideal use case for LN. So that is what you should be hoping for, rather than larger blocks.

They can (and will) offer their own central bank blockchains linked to national currencies. They can (and in some countries will) ban trading crypto's for fiat. 
What they cant do is "hijack" bitcoin (they could with many altcoins). Thats the whole point of a decentralised consensus ledger. There is practically no way to stop it. If/when we get satellite nodes, it becomes even more undoable.

@_date: 2018-01-11 12:50:43
Fair enough. So here  is the dilemma: if you scale the blocksize and guessed wrong, there is no going back, you just turned bitcoin in to a Paypal 2.0. If you didnt scale the blocksize, the worst that can happen is that you limit use cases and hamper adoption until you come up with a different solution than big blocks. A solution you're going to need anyhow. Thats not a difficult choice for me.

Generating addresses isnt very useful as attack. You would need to create private keys (and test them, but even that can be ignored when its unfeasible to generate even the tiniest fraction of all possible private keys).
As to whether the rest of that image is accurate; I cant vouch for it either, but Im sure the gist of it is correct.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:48:36
You probably can, assuming you have the recovery seed. With that seed, recover your wallet using one of these apps:
Then export your private keys (you'll need to check which of those apps supports that and how to do that), and import those keys in one of the wallets that support the forks. 
Edit: should have read my own link. Just recover the private keys with this:

If I believed DAG based tokens would actually work, even when fully decentralised and under any circumstance, including large scale / game theory based /nation state level attacks, then bitcoin risks becoming pointless anyhow.

No they are not. An IOU is a debt note. Something anyone can issue, but only has value if you trust the issuer to honor his debt. A bitcoin is the exact opposite. It can not be issued based on debt, it can not be defaulted on. The fiat exchange value has nothing to do with this.

1 re: people don't care; until cash is being outlawed and bank accounts are blocked or seized. If you live in a prosperous nation with a benign or benevolent government, you may not see the point. Yet.  If you live in a dictatorship, or Venezuela, Brazil, Argentine, India, Cyprus, even Greece and soon enough Spain or Italy, you might begin to see the point of being the custodian of your own wealth.
2 re "Irreversible". Irreversibility is what enables it to work without trust, oversight or governance. Its not a major selling point by itself, but it does have tangible advantages especially for companies that are plagued by credit card fraud.
3 Re Fast; paypal or visa are not fast. Not if you are a retailer accepting them. It may take weeks before you get the money, and it takes 3+ months before the money actually clears. 
5 "Permissionless". This is so much broader than buying sex dolls. Billions of people dont have access to banking because they have no papers, ie, no permission. Many more cant start a business even just online and accept payment, because visa wont let them because of their credit rating, age, country of residence, whatever.  Try raising funds in fiat and compare that to how easy it is with crypto ICO's. Try creating any kind of financial innovation with fiat without a banking license and 100's of millions of capital, and compare that whats being done on ethereum.
5 "limited items in this world". What other *digital* items are scarce? Thats the whole point of satoshi's invention. Until 2009, anything that was digital could be copied, and therefore could never be scarce. So the only way to have digital money was using trusted third parties.
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:16:13
You cant be that dense. If bitcoin price collapses, 'converting back to dollar', that miner now gets $20 for his $10K investment. IOW, if you invest in mining hardware, even if you look at it as a dollar investment, then you ARE speculating on and dependant of future exchange rate, just like someone who would invest that same $10K in to bitcoins directly. So that is what you must compare with to determine if the investment makes sense.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:26:48
Before you can begin to understand why bitcoin has value, you have to understand money. Almost no one does. But start by telling them they are wrong. Dollar hasnt been backed by gold for a long time. 
But even when it was, what was backing the value of gold? It was just a consensus, we all decided it was a useful measure of value, because it is scarce, durable, difficult to forge, portable etc.  All traits it shares with bitcoin.

If by usable you mean you can do cheap transactions, then as long as its "usable",its usage will increase, until it no longer is usable.  It doesnt really matter much whether you're limited to 100Kb, 1MB or 10MB blocks when the overall demand is gigabytes. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:19:40
Yeah, thats been posted a few times.  It seems across the EU, these rules are similar. Capital gains from personal investments are excempt, except when you do it "professionally", then you are taxed.  Which is great if you made a few thousand euro and you have a normal income. But if your crypto profit is 2x larger than your regular income, or worse, you dont have a regular income, good luck arguing you didnt do it as a (parttime) profession, that you failed to declare, failed to pay social, income and other taxes on etc. Could get really expensive.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:22:51
thanks for that. 
As for the tx becoming invalid with a hardfork, I assume its not that difficult to implement a transition period, changing the tx format first, and applying the new rules only x blocks later. If so, it would only impact old transactions lingering in the mempool. Anyway, that wasnt the issue, my question has been answered, thx!

@_date: 2018-01-08 17:27:03
Im personally not vehemently opposed to a 2MB increase, but I also think its rather pointless. In no time, probably literally, those 2MB blocks will be just as full as the current 1MB ones. The size of the mempool backlog and the height of the tx fees really is just a measure of what people are willing to cope with to get their BTC transactions through. If you cant make blocks anywhere near large enough to actually record all demand, then I dont see what difference a larger block makes. Other than making running nodes a lot harder. 
Anyway, sure, I'd vote for 2MB blocks, if only to be able to prove the point that we need a different scaling solution than bigger blocks.

But if so, if his wallet by then had &gt;100 addresses, the change would have been sent to an address that didnt exist yet in the wallet.dat he backed up earlier.

This is only true as long as mining hardware depreciates faster than an icecube melts in the sun, like now. In a few short years we've gone from mining on GPU's, to FPGA's, to "ancient" 90nm asic production process, to  65nm, 45nm, ... all the way to 12nm now I believe. Thats more advanced than what Intel or AMD are using. Every process generation gave a huge efficiency boost, so every time you have to make up on your investment *really fast*. Even shipping the hardware internationally was a huge opportunity cost, miners have chartered 747s to get their devices faster (not kidding). 
But we are now approaching the limits of whats technically achievable. This progress will flatten out, and therefore you'll get many years to make back your hardware investment. The overal cost will shift overwhelmingly to energy cost, and you will be better off mining 20% of the time with free electricity than mining 100% of the time burning coal or gas.


We're nowhere near close to exhausting even existing unused renewable energy supplies. This shift has barely even started. But if that would ever happen, it will still be an incentive to develop more renewable energy. Solar, wind and hydro are simply cheaper than burning hydrocarbon if do not need to transport the energy from the source to its destination and if you dont need constant supply. Which is true for mining and almost nothing else.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:50:34
This used to be perfectly possible, and I have done it many times. But for such small amounts, its currently not feasible anymore. Bitcoin is "too valuable", and transaction fees are too high right now. You'll need to wait for lightning network or other scaling solutions, or use an altcoin.

First of all, I never said I thought it was a good idea to accept bitcoin in retail stores at this point, especially for low value transactions.

Money has no memory. It makes no difference if you earned that money through a day job, inheritance, lottery or by buying bitcoin when it was $5.
I think you confuse the % of your wealth invested in bitcoin with the source of that wealth. If had 95% of my wealth in bitcoin I would have long sold. Hint: I did sell. I sold at $30, at $300, at $3000 at $10000 and $15000. I always kept only a reasonably amount of my wealth in bitcoin. So unlike many who got in to bitcoin at the same time, Im not a bazillionaire, but I can HODL when its going down, or buy some more. Not because I bought cheap, but because I can afford to lose the portion of my wealth I have invested in it. *Everyone should be able to say that*. If you cant, then you're reckless, no matter when you bought in.

Aside from ethereum, and to some extend, monero, altcoins arent being adopted. No one uses any of the other altcoins in the top 20 for anything besides speculation. Maybe to transfer funds between exchanges, something even tether can do (and bitcoin payment channels ought to do far better). The two alts I mentioned, their adoption is not because of bitcoins tx fees, but because they enable use cases bitcoin cant provide right now (anonymity, advanced smart contracts). But they have the same scaling problems that bitcoin has.

Stocks are generally considered a "good father investment", a normal way to manage your wealth, even if you do well. There is also a tax, but taxes are withheld by your broker and not dependant on your profit. 
Highly speculative investments, like daytrading, is not exempt, at least where I live. And you are supposed to declare those and pay 33% tax on the profits. Even though there is no firm distinction between them, its just a matter of interpretation. Ill bet a bitcoin that within a year, bitcoin investments will explicitly and automatically be considered "speculative", so best case scenario Id be looking at 33% tax. 
More likely though, earning more through speculative trading than my normal job, I will be taxed as a professional. 
The situation might be different where you live, but if significant sums are involved, talk to a tax professional, preferably one who is aware of crypto.

No one uses CPU to mine bitcoins, miners use specialized SHA256 asics.  PoW is based on game theory, and assumes miners just do what is in their financial best interest. If they leave to mine some other coin, difficulty will drop, and and profitability of btc mining will go up, luring them back or more new miners. Its no different when btc price goes up or down.
The only real concern here, is alt coins using the same PoW algorithm that bitcoin uses. These coins tend have a value and thus hashrate that is only a tiny fraction of bitcoin. So these coins can be 51% attacked trivially by just about any bitcoin mining farm/pool. Something similar is true for any (small) altcoin that relies on GPU mining. Any ethereum mining farm or pool can 51% those for profit or just for the heck of it (which is why "asic resistance" is such a dumb idea, and developing your own asics like siacoin does, a good one)

You need input and output addresses (that obviously need to be unique), you need a secure signature and you need the amount. The result is at least a few hunderd bytes per transaction, and you cant just compress or shrink that information in any meaningful way. Even if by some mathematical miracle you could reduce the size of the information by a factor 10x, you really havent solved anything in the grand scheme of things.

Call it what you want, but if say bitfinex and bittrex setup such a channel, the funding needed for that channel would be not much more than the average difference between bitcoins in/out of either exchange for every hour/day/week, which is probably just a few percent of the overall transaction volume. So the net effect ought to be a dramatic reduction in "hot coins" compared to keeping the entire transaction volume in hot wallets.

Bitcoin cant appreciate in value forever, certainly not at the current rate. Eventually it will level off. In the future we also have instant &amp; automatic atomic swaps between chains. We can build inflationary IOU tokens based on bitcoin, just like we made fiat based on gold. And they may be thousands of other solutions I have not thought off, or no one has thought of yet. This is all so new. Think internet in 1990. No one knows how this will work out in detail, but technology that lets you decentralise trust is probably at least as important an invention as the technology for decentralising information (which the internet did).

Which asic, and who do you think its profitable for? You're probably just falling in to the same trap, calculating how much a bitcoin miner earns you *today* and ignoring the fact the difficulty is going up more than exponential, ensuring you'll almost certainly never earn back your investment.
And when you look at profitability of a bitcoin miner, which you usually pay for in bitcoin to produce bitcoins, you must look at bitcoin denominated profit. If you spent $1K in btc to buy a miner last year, and it produced $2K worth of bitcoin, you really spent 1BTC to earn 0.2BTC.

Some people also have the ability to use their brain and apply simple logic. You should try it, you will be amazed how much predictive power that has. Nothing that has happened in the bitcoin mining space since 2011 surprised me, and I have predicted virtually all of it. The move to fpga's and ever more advanced asics. The fact that asics would largely be unprofitable for end users. The bazillion fold increase in difficulty which I have been ridiculed for predicting countless times. The concentration of mining power near mining hardware production facilities initially. And the upcoming transition to cheap green energy mining (which was the first investable prediction, so I have invested in it). All of it was completely predictable based on existing technology, market incentives and simple logic. Yes, inevitable.

Scaling solutions will come, but no one can know when and what level they will scale. So why dont we just wait and see and not risk the core concept behind bitcoin? Moreover, if we keep raising the block size, we disincentivize the development and adoption of actual scaling solutions. Case in point, bcash doesnt even support segwit, and no one is going to bother testing it with LN, let alone deploy it or use it. So whatever time you "win" by stretching the blocks, you lose in getting scaling solutions ready to market.

IMO thats exactly why so many unproven and untested blockchains, dysfunctional tokens, scamcoins and centralised database tokens are gaining billions in valuation. 
(In fairness, coins like ethereum and bitcoin are also appreciating in value because these very same people tend to have to buy bitcoin first, before being able to trade their shitcoins).
Bitcoin isnt perfect, it has lots of rough edges and plenty of area's where it needs to improve. Its by no means ready to be everything to everyone. But it really is like the internet in 1990's, an incredible foundation to build on. At the same time, most  altcoins are more like Compuserve or AOL. Walled garden, they may look more polished and accessible (low fees, fast transactions blahblah), noobs think they discovered the next generation, but they are missing the big picture completely.

If you see no transactions, then you need not worry. I dont know what the problem is, but your coins havent been stolen.
I assume you transferred some coins from an exchange to your ledger? Go to your exchange account, look at your withdrawal history, find the address(es) you withdrew too. Enter these addresses in a bitcoin blockexplorer and verify the balance is still there. That will let you breath easier while your figure out the problem with your ledger or ledger software.
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:47:56
bitcoin nodes will not propagate a transaction if it conflicts with one they received earlier, unless the original transaction was sent as a replaceable transaction (Replace by Fee protocol). Obviously you wouldnt want to accept a RBF transaction in a store.  There is still a theoretical chance by sending 2 TX, and trying to make the vendor see one, not the other (and running out of the store fast enough), but thats a pretty complicated and far fetched attack for some chicken. And it can be defended against:

Tell me about it. I was faced with this recently when I split my wallet to collect Bcash and the other forks, and move my cold wallet to a ledger. I used bitcoin qt, seeing the balance updates in bitcoinqt as the blocks came in and got processed, hurt.  A lot. If only stopping the network syncing actually stopped the transactions :p.
But I never sold at $2, I think the lowest I sold was $5. And that wasnt even selling, I used BTC to buy more GPUs, so not exactly the worst use as mining was still profitable back then. But then I actually began selling at $10, $30, $100, $300,... 
Still, I hope like me, you where smart enough to never sell everything. Hindsight is 20/20, but I cant be too unhappy, I never risked a single euro, at any time if the price had collapsed to zero, I would have made a decent fiat profit. That decent profit today is really a significant sum. I could have been a bazillionaire, but with hindsight, anyone can.

No offense, but I have been around the block, and have a pretty good grasp of how bitcoin works, no need for that video. 
What you are doing is confusing bitcoin with the dollar value of that bitcoin. Thats why you think its an "IOU" or intangible. But thats just wrong. In ancient times they used seashells as money. It had no intrinsic value. But it was an asset, not an IOU. If instead they used clay tablets to keep track of payments, then you have an IOU. The tablet may say I owe you 2 sheep, but I might not have them.
Bitcoin is just like the seashell, its  absolutely an asset, not an IOU. There is no debt involved, no promise. You might have an expectation of value, but thats your problem, not bitcoins. 1BTC=1BTC and there is no way to default on that. 
Unless that bitcoin is stored on an exchange. Then the exchange has the bitcoin, and issues you an IOU, in the form of a bitcoin balance on their website. Thats a debt. Thats a counterparty risk. If the exchange gets hacked, you 'll never see your bitcoin. But if you own the private key, there is no way to default on a bitcoin payment.

Since not everyone will want to use LN, an exchange would need to keep a hot wallet for some withdraws and put btc in channels for others or cross exchange withdraws, but as I see it, whatever is locked up in a LN channel wouldnt need to be in their hot wallet anymore, so I dont see why this would increase the overall amount of "hot BTC" for an exchange. If anything, it might reduce it, as I suspect a majority of transfers are between just a few exchanges and using 2 way channel, the amounts in &amp; out will largely cancel out.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:51:06
If you do that, then you are effectively speculating on bitcoin exchange rate, because miners can only produce bitcoins, not dollars. If the exchange rate collapses, your bitcoin revenue is not affected, only your dollar revenue.
Of course, thats the error countless individual miners made. Thinking they made profit from mining, when really they just profited a little bit from bitcoins parabolic price increase.If they had just kept their btc, or invested their dollar in btc rather than mining hardware, they would have been FAR better off. And if BTC price had collapsed, they had seen how idiotic their purchase really was.

You can only profit from arbitrage by having (significant) funds on various exchanges and sending money from one to the other after each operation. IOW, you risk a lot of money on those exchanges, and profits are razor thin. Sometimes there are brief opportunities that make it worth it, like when a coin gets added to an exchange, but overall its just not worth it. Particularly not if you (rightfully) distrust the exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:18:44
As an end user, yes. Marginal cost to produce an asic was just a tiny percentage of expected mining revenue. So market prices where skyhigh, many of orders of magnitude above actual cost. That simply meant more would be produced, increasing the difficulty, lowering the revenue and invalidating the assumptions of earlier buyers. higher difficult means lower expected revenue, which means lower hardware market prices, which means higher difficulty for any given bitcoin price. Rince and repeat over and over again.  That problem gets compounded with every new generation of miners that is far more efficient than the previous. 
The only thing that allowed one to profit from mining hardware sometimes was production constraints and delays in shipping of new miners (which of course burnt the people waiting for these miners). Some early adopters of asics did well, the overwhelming majority made a colossal bitcoin denominated loss.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:46:56
Im still going to tell you to cash out a part. Take profits. Like 1/3 in fiat. If the price go down, just put Delta to show your holding in BTC (which will go up). If the price goes up, just put it in dollar/euro. You always win and sleep like a baby :). And as extra bonus, if it really goes down a lot, you have spare cash at hand to buy the dip.

No they wont! Hardware production cost of asics is completely trivial. market price of miners are still sky high, because we are not satisfying demand yet. But we will, and then the electricity miners will use during their lifetimes will be a high multiple of the hardware cost. So there will be every financial incentive to mine only partially with free electricity. In fact, with time it will be uneconomical to mine with anything other than free, excess electricity.
But clearly you're not understanding a thing Im writing, or you dont want to understand the implications. That wont change reality.

Im a Joe Blow that used to run btc and full ether nodes. I had to give up running an ethereum full node, because my harddrive couldnt keep up, it currently requires an SSD. 1TB SSDs, not that cheap. If bitcoin blockchain would double or quadruple, Id need to invest in a large SSD for that alone, not many people will do that. Why do I want to run a full node? Because being a peer 2 peer currency is what got me into crypto. If I and most other Joe Blows cant run full nodes, then its no longer a P2P architecture, it becomes a client/server aka master/slave architecture.

See my other reply below; basically today crypto's are not a better universal payment system -yet. This will happen, see Lightening network to get a glimpse of the future, but if you have access to systems that work for you, and you need not fear a currency collapse or whatever, then there is no point yet. Crypto's are still too complicated and usually too slow, expensive and cumbersome to pay for groceries. If you want to transfer $1 million to a supplier in Taiwan or China, it could be a different story.
But you shouldnt judge crypto's based on that, anymore than you should have judged the internet based on its capabilities when we had a Gopher browser and 20 academic websites.   As a user, you might have done well ignoring internet back then, until it became useable and useful for normal people. Likewise, if you dont see a need for it, feel free to ignore crypto's as a user today. As an investor, take the long view. Opportunities like these are once in a generation.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:59:39
Yes. And no. Yes because clearly exchanges are centralised, and suffer all the flaws of centralised institutions. Which is why you should avoid them if you can, not use them as banks and withdraw your crypto's to a wallet you control yourself (otherwise, it becomes an IOU issued by the exchange, and they could default on their obligation if they get hacked or whatever).
No, because you only really need centralised exchanges to interact with *fiat* currency. Crypto to crypto can be done on smartcontract driven decentralised exchanges. And acquiring or spending crypto can be done without exchanges, just accept them for goods and services.  In a world without fiat, we wouldnt need centralised exchanges.

Thats because you underestimate just how big 2^256 is. Nothing prevents you from generating a random private key and seeing if it unlocks a non empty wallet.  To get to my wallet with all the computational power of the world would probably take you longer than the lifespan of the universe. Along the way you might unlock a handful of other non empty wallets, but the odds are so ridiculously low, you should be more worried about being hit by a unicorn dropped by an alien spaceship.

Electricity consumption is essentially determined by the value of the block reward that miners collect. So it varies with the dollar value of a bitcoin, but the amount of bitcoin that miners get as blockreward, also halves every 4 years.  
As for the environmental impact; can someone link Andreas' video on the topic? He made a brilliant point. Essentially bitcoin will over time become a green electricity subsidy. Bitcoin miners will mine where electricity is cheapest. That is not coal powered electricity, or even nuclear power. Its renewable energy close to its source (transporting electricity is expensive and inefficient), and especially when there is a temporary overcapacity.  Wind farms now dump their excess electricity production in giant eletrical heaters. Why not use that electricity to mine coins? Hydro electrical dams just let water flow through when there isnt enough demand. Again, why not use it?  Same with solar plants.
This is not just theory any longer. Check this out:
They specifically make mining containers to be put next to renewable energy sources to monetize overcapacity. In Canada they have overcapacity of hydro power, guess who's flocking there?
Mining lets green electricity producers earn money from energy that would otherwise go to waste, and which is not contributing to any pollution or Co2.  Its a subsidy. Greenpeace should be a huge fan of bitcoin!

Moore's law is about transistor density, not storage or bandwidth cost. HDD costs per GB have bottomed out and remained relatively flat the past years. And the move to SSDs means that the average price per GB is actually going up, not down.
Even if the price per GB where to follow Moore's Law (doubling every 18 months), thats not nearly fast enough to keep up with bitcoin's current growth, let alone allow it to reach visa levels anytime soon. Unless you want to wait 50 years *and* assume Moore's Law can somehow continue to scale (we are already hitting a quantum physical brick wall)  then we need smarter solutions than big blocks.

I think the burden of proof overwhelmingly lies with anyone claiming it will work. I'm not a data scientist, but essentially a DAG is a merkle tree like bitcoin, but without the blocks. Ive seen no convincing evidence that tree will always converge to a consensus, without blocks or without centralized help. I find it very disconcerting that the tokens based on it are not proving themselves by exposing themselves to attacks, and rely on convoluted voting mechanisms with known flaws, or central coordinators, supposedly because the volume is still too low. If thats the case, why not spend a few thousand of your ICO billions to rent some servers and generate transaction volume?

Im talking about years ago, when miners where people like me buying the devices, running them at home. When electricity cost seemed completely moot, because the hardware cost 10K and spent a few 100 in electricity. Asic manufacturers didnt mine themselves back then, they only sold the hardware. That changed, predictably, after ripping off end users, they put their own hardware at work, with far lower hardware cost, lower shipping cost, lower electricity cost, ensuring they could easily out compete all the suckers that first funded them by buying their hardware. Entirely predictable.

If you live in a democratic country with a stable currency, there is no case to be made (yet) to use crypto for everyday purchases (edit: well, unless you value privacy!). If you live in a corrupt country, or one with hyperinflation, or one with tight capital control, or you have had your funds seized in Cyprus, Greece, India,  or you live in a poor country where billions dont even have access to banking, if you want to trade with a country thats under sactions, or want to donate to an organisation thats being boycotted (wikileaks),  you might have different perspective on the importance of "being your own bank".
Mind you, this is only talking about the first application of decentralised blockchains: money. Money is an app, the simplest one. They can do so much more. Another easy to understand example is that one day, blockchains will replace stock exchanges. They are already replacing crowdfunding and VC funding. They are beginning to be used in supply chain management, property management, intellectual/digital right management,  and a bazillion other applications. We've barely scratched the surface. Think internet in 1992, and you're looking at a CLI email client wondering: whats the point? Faxing works fine.
The internet decentralised (digital) information and communication, giving anyone the ability to become a worldwide shop, a phone company, a newspaper or a tv station. Blockchains decentralise (digital) value, giving anyone the ability to become an international bank (/exchange/broker/notary/whatever). Its difficult to overstate how revolutionary this is.

Thats a fallacy. 


No one ever denied capacity would go up. But why is that important, when you cant scale to meet anywhere near overall demand?  You lure in new users with the promise of low fees and fast transactions, and months later you hit the exact same problem. Its not a solution, its a deception. And one that undermines the P2P concept.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:35:25
To start with your last point about being more secure than we can afford to; building a P2P alternative to fiat or gold that is secure enough to protect a current value of hundreds of billions of dollars against every conceivable or conceived attack from not just hackers, but also nation states and the world wide financial industry.. that is just an amazing achievement. One that I doubt anyone believed possible 10 years ago. You might argue that its security today is overkill. But only if you assume that it wouldnt be attacked otherwise by nation states or the bazillion dollar financial industry. I wouldnt bet on that. 
More over, hashrate and mining rewards correlate directly with BTC market value. If the current hashrate is overkill for the small number of users and use cases, then IMO its primarily because the value attributed to bitcoin is overkill for what it can currently do. Price is extremely speculative and if its based on anything then its based on expectations of what bitcoin might be able to do in the future. The security scales with that. To me, thats a feature, not a bug. The bug might be the current valuation, which is also what makes transactions so expensive (in dollar terms).
As for fees that miners earn vs blockreward; it feels like yesterday when the number one concern I read was: what happens when blockrewards drop too low, who will mine? The idea that fees would pay for it seemed unrealistic. Now you seem to think the sum of fees is too high. It currently seems to average around 3-4 BTC per block, compared to 12.5 BTC block reward. That ratio doesnt seem unreasonable or disproportionate to me. Looks like we're on track to replace block reward as primary motivation with transaction reward in the next 5 or 10 years. I do hope by that time we can do a ton more transactions with the same blocks, but other than that, I fail to see the problem.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:22:14
Nah, bitcoin isnt the only one. Most PoW blockchains would fit that description, although none are as secure. But the majority of recent investors dont get that (yet), they think databases with high TPS and low fees are somehow a new invention, just because it now comes with a token you have to buy and transactions that are a few thousand or million times more expensive than on any plain old SQL database.

I dont think anyone ever claimed LN was the end game solution that would allow bitcoin to scale to a global ubiquitous payment network.

Wrong question. Right question: how will they stop it? Trading with fiat on exchanges can be made impossible, but that was impossible in the first years of bitcoin anyway, and it still worked. People just sold goods and services for bitcoin or exchanged peer 2 peer, just like they use dollar in countries where that is forbidden.  Using bitcoin can be made illegal, but so is pot in most countries, or torrenting movies. Its not like that went away. Draconian censorship on the internet might make it difficult to use, but we're already sending up satellites to circumvent even that.
TLDR, bitcoin would lose a lot of value (in fiat), but it will not go away. And if ever there is such a government, bitcoin would be more important and valuable (in the broad sense) than ever.

Im counting like this: demand for blockchain space is so strong that people are currently willing to pay ~$150 for transactions and still wait several hours on average. 2MB blocks will allow more transactions, but that increase will come no where near to satisfying demand for instant transactions at 1/10th of the current fees, let alone at 1/100th. So they will be full.  You can make blocks 10x as big, and they will still fill up.  If nothing else, with tx spam as long tx fees are neglible.

No, thats not the point of mining. That is just a small part of it. Its also ordering transactions in blocks that can not forged without spending enormous amounts of 'work' (electricity). Thats what keeps it secure. Without that, anyone could publish blocks and you wouldnt know who to believe.

Visa did 141 billion tx last year:
 That works out to ~80TB per year. More over,  Visa can handle 65K TPS for peaks. You would need blocks large enough to handle peak periods. In peak periods those would fill, and you would need to pay a market fee, every other moment spamming would be virtually free filling up a cool petabyte per year.  ANd wasnt the goal to bank the unbanked? So a few billion extra users that visa doesnt serve? And even if you manage that, you still havent solved anything, because the network will not only be used as often as visa, it will be used for anything and everything. Until it no longer can, because blocks are full and fees are "high".
Then there is the fun of bootstrapping a node after your network has been operating for, say, 5 years?
Anyway, this has been discussed to death. Let BCH do their lazy scaling solution that ultimately cant work, BTC will do its thing and we'll find out how that works.

blockchain.info is definitely wrong. Very, very wrong. What the real number is, you cant know, because of how bitcoin works; you can not tell what part of the output addresses is a change address (owned by the sender) and how much is actually being sent to someone else or a different wallet. But whenever I check a withdrawal transaction from an exchange,  which are huge, batched transactions, blockchain estimates the value at like 0.00002 BTC, when in reality it is usually dozens or 100s of BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:38:35
No its not. Electricity consumption doesnt scale with adoption or transaction volume. It scales with the value of bitcoin and blockreward, the latter halving every ~4 years. So in the long run, electricity consumption will go down, even if LN and other scaling solutions may allow billions of transactions.
Also, what people dont realize enough, is that bitcoin will increasingly use renewable energy. Why? Because its cheaper, particularly close to the source where there tends to be local overcapacity and Transporting electricity from there to where its needed is expensive and inefficient.  Close to hydro, geothermal or wind farms is the perfect place to mine, monetizing local or temporary renewable energy overcapacity. Right now that energy goes to waste, excess wind energy is dumped as heat in giant electrical heaters. Water just flows over the dam when demand is low. Why not use that energy for bitcoin miners instead? Its the perfect green electricity subsidy.

You dont really have to wait for any confirmations with in store purchases, you can  accept a low dollar transaction the moment it hits the mempool and assuming it has sufficient fees. Your risk will be much lower than accepting credit card payment. You do need confirmations when there is a risk of double spend attack, which would be online when you can time your transaction to coincide with a block you found but held back. Again, for low value transactions, it really isnt a big risk. Who's going to risk witholding a 12.5 BTC block to have a chance at a free chicken? Fees is a different matter. As it is today, it doesnt make much sense to me for fried chicken.

Crimes are almost never solved by examining bank accounts, although arguably, the biggest crimes happen on bank accounts. Fact is, terrorists have no problem getting funded using USD and if you want money laundered, JPMorgan, UBS or Deutsche Bank are there for you. 
As for taxes; again if you have enough money, this isnt a problem with fiat. Large corporations and the uber rich get away easily with paying little to no taxes. its only the little guy that doesnt have access to the right financial instruments or overseas accounts, so he cant hide anything and pays taxes for the rich. Blockchains level the playing field.
But why would you even want to tax money? Thats almost as crazy as taxing labor. Tax consumption instead, and everyone will pay taxes, even thieves and drug dealers.
BTW, using smart contracts, you could make consumption/sale tax completely transparent and provable, without necessarily giving up any privacy. A shop could prove for every sales transaction that taxes where indeed collected, and those taxes can go directly and automatically to the government. Supply chains will increasingly be managed by blockchains, and could give governments selective insights, enough for instance to know no taxes where evaded  (and for food/drug safety and that sort of thing), without having to know what I bought when or where. Blockchain offer an incredible flexibility that is impossible to achieve with fiat. But its fundamentally neutral technology, it can be used for good or for bad, just like any other technology.

You have to take that risk seriously; Governments just dont see the danger yet, they somehow seem to think repackaged custodial fiat currency like Libra is a threat to their monetary autonomy, when the real threat is obviously a crypto currency they can not control. Wars have been fought over smaller issues than control over the money supply, so I would go as far as saying its just a matter of time until they wake up, see the real threat, and do anything and everything they can to stop it.
And that will be bitcoins ultimate test: surviving governments attempt to kill it or ban it.  Yes, its value will suffer tremendously,  if you are not ready for that, dont get in it; but if it survives, and I think it will, it will have proven to be what we like to claim it is: unstoppable money. And as a result, it will be worth a whole lot more to me after passing that test. If it fails that test, it has no reason to exist.

The key is "similar outcomes".. You're only thinking fast/low fee transactions, which we could do even before bitcoin.

We dont need to stop growing our economy, thats idiotic, we do need to consume and produce more in sustainable ways. In many ways, that requires progress. Renewable energy, alternative food sources, EVs, nuclear fusion, all of that requires investments, wealth that we need to produce.


How do  you think to get a loan at all with a deflationary/fixed supply currency and no collateral? Would you lend your bitcoins to me if you knew its value would keep going up every year ? Of course you would not, unless you where somehow virtually sure I would pay you back MORE bitcoins, each of which will be worth more than the one I borrowed. A poor person would not even get credit, he could never pay it back. An entrepreneur with a fantastic businessplan would only get if by getting fleeced by the people who have the money. The rich would have no incentive to invest or lend out money, they would rather just sit on it and get richer. Unless they can grow the amount of money they have in absolute terms, which means they not only get richer, they even grow their share of the overall wealth. Its self reinforcing. 
With inflation, they need to put their money at work, risk it by investing it, lending it, spending it - or lose it.

They are doing them anyway. People transfer their coins between exchanges all the time to buy some alt thats not listed on that exchange, or for arbitrage or whatever.  Many use altcoins now, or tether, but most trading pairs are BTC denominated, so its quite a hassle to first sell altcoin X for BTC, then convert btc to tether or some other altcoin, transfer to other exchange, then do the opposite all over again. So why wouldnt exchanges want to lower the cost of those transactions (regardless of whether they pass on all the savings to their customers) ? Having well funded, well connected LN channels may also become an alternative source of income for these exchanges, especially when the market moves to decentralised exchanges.


 
Obviously they will not balance perfectly. But thats not necessary either for this to make sense. Even if say kraken &gt; coinbase is 125% the volume of the opposite  direction, then as I understand, kraken would only need ~25% in their payment channel compared to the hot wallet now. And even if it doesnt change the amount of hot coins, it will certainly be cheaper than doing everything onchain. Have you done a BTC withdrawal from Bittrex recently? Here is one I did from bittrex to another exchange, dont remember which:
0.4 BTC in fees. Bittrex withdrawals transactions are almost always "instant" for me, so for all I know, they may do that every 10 minutes. Thats a *lot* of money. And thats just one exchange. Although, admittedly, not all of these transactions will be exchange to exchange and bittrex is IMO "too" fast and overpaying ridiculously.

Sure. But paper dollars only work when you trade with someone locally. They are pretty useless on the internet. And paper money is soon a thing of the past; governments all over the world are severely restricting cash, and it wont be long before its banned outright. Also note, that paper money is one the few ways we still have to do P2P value transfers without trusted third party. If bitcoin is described as an "electronic cash" system, its because it shares most of its attributes with paper cash, rather than electronic fiat. P2P, trustless, irreversible, permissionless, open access, ...

The difference between fiat and (most) crypto's is not the finite supply, thats just a property you can choose for either system.  The difference is that crypto's are not IOUs. 
Before bitcoin, the only way to transact something of value electronically was using a trusted third party with a database. That database would record who owns what to whom. This is as true for (digital) money as it is for stocks, or property.  Thats why we need banks and stock exchanges/brokers and notaries.  The problem with this approach? The middleman (who has control and can charge fees) and counterparty risk, as anything in that database is by definition an IOU.
With crypto currencies, a database record does not refer to something of value (IOU), it *is* the thing of value (asset). Its like an electronic bearer bond. Therefore you can transact peer 2 peer, without third party, without counterparty risk. Thats what this is all about.
As for infinite inflation due to infinite number of coins; that only true if these new coins gain infinite value.  The value of most token scales with the number of users. Their security scales with their value. And there are other network effects that greatly limit the value of a new token that is nothing other than new.

Bitcoin mining hardware efficiency has increased like a million fold in 5 years. That is NOT going to continue. We are reaching absolute state of the art now, so the very best you can hope for Moore's law to continue which is a few 100000 slower than the progress we made until recently.  And almost no one believes even Moore's law is tenable anymore, as we are hitting atomic level scales, there just is no way around that.

Even if you assume one day there will be billions of wallets with non trivial coins in them, that number is so tiny compared to the number of possible seeds,  that it doesnt really change the math.
copy paste from Schneier:
One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than *kT*, where *T* is the absolute temperature of the system and *k* is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)
Given that *k* = 1.38 × 10\^−16 erg/K, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2 Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2 K would consume 4.4 × 10\^−16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.
Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21 × 10\^41 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7 × 10\^56 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured *all* its energy for 32 years, without *any* loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2\^192. Of course, it wouldn't have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.
But that's just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 10\^51ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.
These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that **brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.**
Once you grasp the scope of the problem of bruteforcing 256 bit, you realize that improving your odds by a factor of a mere billion or so, which is just a few bits, makes no difference at all.
edit: the above applies to 24 word seeds, not 12. 12 word seeds (128 bit) theoretically might be possible to bruteforce with existing technology given a few billion years.

I dont think its really related to the price. As long as bitcoin is mostly traded on exchanges against fiat currencies, I dont think governments really care, regardless of bitcoin price.  They can and do control exchanges, they can identify holders and tax profits.  Whether bitcoin trades at 100 or 100K, makes no difference to them.
IMO governments will only  see it as a major problem if bitcoin becomes more useable and used outside regulated exchanges.  If people  earn and spend bitcoins without passing through fiat and without governments knowing about it. I assume the next step will be regulating payment processors like bitpay to force them to provide governments with KYC/AML data. 
 But I have no clue about timelines of either regulations or bitcoin price. I think libra accelerated the awareness, so this may happen sooner than I had thought, but who knows really.

It doesnt have to be. In bitcoin, there is a need for a native token (also called bitcoin), as an incentive for miners to spend electricity to keep the network secure. Its also needed as a cost to prevent network spam (doing a transaction costs some millibtc). If transactions are free, then its easy to spam the network to the point where it no longer works. To be an open, trustless blockchain, bitcoin needs incentives and disincentives, and thats accomplished with a native token.
Less decentralised blockchains that do not have similar game theory proof incentives, can work without a token. The price you pay for that, is that it requires trust among the users of the system, or at least trust in the ones maintaining the ledger. This is more database like than bitcoin like though, but the upside is that generally you get a system that is far more scalable. This can be a perfectly acceptable compromise in some situations. IBM Hyperledger is an example of a tokenless blockchain. Think of it as a closed intranet for money, whereas bitcoin is an open internet for money.

1. it would most likely have been saved in an unencrypted bitcoin-qt wallet.
2. not safe at all. Anyone hacking in to the PC, could have stolen the wallet.dat file, and thereby your bitcoins. No password needed.
3. Nothing special needed. You send 5000BTC to the new wallet address, the rest will be sent as change to your original wallet
4. I believe that upon creation, wallet.dat only contained 100 addresses. So say you make a backup the day you installed bitcoin client, you'd have those 100. If you exhaust those addresses, and dont make a new backup of wallet.dat, your old wallet backup would not contain those new addresses past the first 100.

When it was $10, hardly anyone had  even heard of bitcoin, and among those that had, precious few people believed it could even work. That would make it an unfair comparison point for today. But barely a month ago, is entirely reasonable.
But you know, you did make a good point without realizing it. Even if bitcoin would drop to $10, it would still work, I would still use it, Id have a node as Im sure others would have, and therefore it indeed is pretty much invincible, regardless of how much people value that.

I personally dont care about bitcoins dominance if you measure dominance by market cap and put it up against 1000s of crypto's that are being launched on a daily basis, most of which are completely incomparable. If people want to invest billions in database tokens or whitepapers, why should I care? If central banks decide to create crypto tokens, should we care when those get listed on CMC and dwarf bitcoins market cap? I do care about bitcoin's dominance when it comes to security and decentralisation. 
And larger blocks arent going to help. The only reason I would be in favor of a one time block size increase, is just so we can prove this point once and for all. In no time, blocks will be just as full and tx fees wil be straight back to where they are today.

Never tried the trezor, but I have mixed feelings about the nano. Having bricked 2 with firmware updates (ultimately resolved on a different PC) , having bought a nano X with bluetooth that doesnt work with PC, my next purchase will likely be a trezor.
You should also know that the nano can only hold a very small amount of apps, so if you have many coins, its a bit of a hassle deleting and installing apps, but its not too big a deal.
OTOH, the trezor seems a bit clunky to use IMO. When it works, and for as long as it works, the nano is a nice device that is really simple to use.

Indeed, flat out wrong. It is because bitcoin has value that miners bother to spend energy to mine it. Not the other way around. 
Good money should have NO intrinsic value.  Money is the thing you exchange for things that do have intrinsic value, it is an accounting system that represents real world value. 
Bitcoin has no real intrinsic value (other perhaps than its use to pay fees to store information in the blockchain) Fiat has no intrinsic value, gold has very little (and thats more of a problem than a good thing, as demand for gold for industrial uses can affect its price).
Whats required for money is primarily that its scarce. And durable, divisible, portable,  cant be counterfeited etc.  Not that its useful for anything other than being money.

When you pay market price for a transaction, its not spam. If you pay far less than that, like these 1-5 sat/byte transactions, then its not going to make it in to blocks (at least in BTC), they will just linger in the mempool until they are discarded. Either way, its not a problem.
BCH is different, because blocks are far larger than actually needed,  the market price for a transaction is ~0. So 1 sat/byte "spam" transactions do get confirmed. Which normally wouldnt be a problem, if it werent for the fact that actually fills 8MB blocks. Which is the real problem.

Lets be realistic. If the US and/or EU really decide to crack down on bitcoin, fiat ramps will close everywhere in the world, even in countries where they wouldnt oppose crypto. Just look at Iran. It doesnt matter that  Russia or China or even the EU  want to trade with Iran, if the US sanctions Iran, banks cant afford to do business with it, or with banks that do business with it, and the country simply gets cut off from the fiat banking system completely. They can do that to bitcoin too.

It depends who you want to pass it on to, and how much you trust them.
FWIW, what I did was distribute part of an encryption key (\*) to several members of my family whom I trust plenty enough not to conspire and steal my coins. The key gives access to am encypted file that has my seed (and exchange login data and some instructions etc).
(\*) I did not give them the actual key, but rather a "puzzle" that they can solve that will lead them to the key. The actual key is composed of a string of things I know they know, but no random hacker or thief could know or reasonably guess.


Yes, but then she is entirely dependent on the ledger still being functional and  making no mistakes entering the pin or breaking the USB connector.


That doesnt matter at all. Satoshi for some reason picked 21M coins, but that is completely arbitrary,  it would have worked exactly the same if he had picked 21 trillion or 21 thousand. Even if 20.9 million coins get lost, the remaining ones could still serve the exact same function.

My   .28 BTC miner which was to be delivered in September,  ignoring electricity costs, would only mine  \~0.00178 BTC per day after the upcoming +13% difficulty adjustment. Pushing the payback date from 133 to 160 days if we are delusional enough to assume difficulty to remain constant now. Of course, the 7nm party is only just getting started.  Even if difficulty growth tapers off to \~8% per adjustment, ROI period becomes never ever even with free electricity.

I wouldnt brush it off that easily. The attacker just needs a few minutes with the device, and can bruteforce the passphrase later. For cold storage, it renders the device not much more secure than a paper wallet. In some ways less secure as it would be harder to know someone obtained the seed (paper wallets can easily be sealed), and your hardware wallet is likely somewhere near your PC, whereas a paper wallet would be carefully hidden somewhere.

Misleading. Soon enough, the best place to mine will not be where grid electricity is cheapest; it will be where there is the largest  amount of fluctuations in (renewable) energy supply/demand. in those places you will be able to mine with free or even [negatively priced electricity]( during supply peaks, while providers will sell their energy to the grid during demand peaks.

Consumption and production are the same thing. We measure our economic growth in an inflationary currency. If we dont achieve growth that at least matches inflation, it would mean despite almost all of us working most of our lives, we are all getting poorer. I cant imagine how that is desirable.


Not only that, since money and credit would be scarce, and the rich have no need to be productive, or invest or lend in order to maintain their wealth (or even grow it when the economy grows), the rich would only lend it out at interest, despite the value of the money itself increasing. This only means the rich getting richer while doing nothing, profiting from the work of those that grow the economy, or at least try to.
Seriously, its great if you are rich, but its simply not a good system. And I dont think it ever worked in history. Even gold historically was inflationary due to mining and conquests.  Gold supply is still inflating by 1 or 2 percent per year. Fixed supply currency? I dont think anyone has ever even tried it, because it just makes no sense.

But you wont. Im not telling you to sell everything.
FWIW, Ive been taking profit on the bitcoins I mined since $100. Do I feel like an idiot now? I dont. I feel like I did the sensible thing, never keeping a disproportionate % of my wealth in something that can conceivably go to zero almost overnight. But I always kept enough bitcoins to profit substantially from the upside. Yes, I could have been bazillionaire, if only I had hoddled. But I could have been bazillionaire if I guessed the right lotto numbers, if I bought the right stocks at the right moment, if only I invested in this or that ICO. With hindsight, everyone could have been a bazillionaire. 
But if it went the other way, at least I would at any point have made a very decent return. At this point, a rather spectacular return, which I never would have believed back then. And that feels good, knowing that if bitcoin crashes again, its not a drama, on the contrary, its an opportunity to buy more without really having to worry and still having locked in profit. I bought some for the first time ever when it dipped below $10K. Stress free. If it goes to $50K this year, fantastic. If it drops to $5K first, even better. If goes towards zero, so be it, I can still buy that lambo if I really wanted to. Not sure I could afford insurance, tax and maintenance though ;).

I do not believe  a deflationary currency, much less a fixed supply one, can work as a global currency. Currency is an accounting system, a representation of real world wealth. So all the currency represents all the wealth. In a growing economy, the overall wealth goes up. A fixed supply currency will therefore represent an ever increasing amount of real world wealth. Here is why this cant work IMO:
The people holding the most currency would benefit the most, without contributing anything to the economic growth. They have no incentive to invest or take risks, they can just sit back and reap the rewards of having money. But money by itself cant create wealth, it only represents it, so this inevitably means they profit  at the expense of others, in this case, the people that actually create the economic growth. 
People say inflation is a hidden tax on money, that benefits those who have none. I agree. But deflation is a tax on productivity that hurts people creating economic growth and benefits those who are already rich. That makes no sense. The rich would get richer while doing nothing, leading to ever larger concentration of capital, that can be passed down generations. 
Thats assuming there would be any growth. I find that doubtful. People who have money would have a strong disincentive to spend it, or trade it for goods or services. They even have little incentive to be productive and take risks to saveguard their wealth, they just need to hodle it. Meanwhile people who have no money would have enormous difficulties finding funding or customers for their goods and services.  
A fixed supply currency only makes some sense in a stagnant economy, and IMO, thats exactly what it would lead to.
For all of satoshi's brilliance, I think this is his major mistake. It may have been a necessary one initially, to make people understand why a digital token can be scarce and have any value, but IMO it also makes it impossible  to replace fiat.

One more thing; there is a very easy way to limit your exposure to price volatility; just invest less. No one sane would recommend you put all your wealth in bitcoin today. Just like no one would say bet it all on one stock or even on gold. Just invest as much as you are comfortable losing. If it does go ballistic again, and ends up becoming a viable alternative to gold or other stores, even a tiny % of your wealth invested in it, may have a bigger impact on your portfolio than a significant stake in gold going up by another 0.1%

Wow, you sound confused. These things have nothing to do with each other. Already many of us switched from pricing things in BTC to milliBTC (mBTC).

This is easy to solve; create the money and  give it directly to the people in the form a universal basic income.
As for your pig farm; with a fixed supply currency in a growing economy, by the time you would have saved enough to buy your farm, you would probably be crazy to actually buy one.  You would be risking your capital, you would  need to be more profitable than the overall economic growth (ie beat deflation), or you would be better off just hodling your money. Which is what most people would do.
More over, good luck getting a loan from anyone. No one would want to lend you their money, except if they -on average- can be assured they will get back more money than they put in.  More money in absolute terms, but since the value of that money also goes up with a fixed supply currency, means much more wealth. Instead of getting rich by being  productive, people would get rich because they have money. Rich would get ever richer. That can only mean the poor get poorer.

We live twice as long as a few generations ago. Its called progress. It requires economic growth.
BTW, if you think wages are low, its at least partially because of the increasing wealth gap where a small percentage of the population controls the an increasingly large part of the wealth, the means of production, the IP and the money.

I have to, because you keep insisting you shouldnt even compare them, "because you buy your gear with fiat and you dont know what bitcoin will be worth". Only when you acknowledge you indeed should only compare the amount of stuff you will mine over time, compared its cost TODAY, then we can move on to the next phase of explaining why you will pretty much never mine more than it costs BTC denominated.
Here is the short version: if ASICs  at retail prices could be expected to mine more  bitcoins than they would cost to you, then the ASIC manufacturers can mine many times more than that because they have access to that same hardware, earlier, at just a fraction of your cost and probably even with cheaper electricity.  So why wouldnt they ? The only way for you to make a bitcoin denominated profit is for them to chose not to profit a lot more, for some reason deciding not to mine themselves or not selling those ASICS to other miners at ever decreasing prices, either of which will increase difficulty until it no longer is profitable **FOR THEM**.  Which means you, having paid retail prices, which are based on demand by the stupidest of miners that only look at  todays difficulty (and calculate in dollars), will be way under water, even with free electricity.
Unless you have access to asic hardware at cost, and until hardware depreciation becomes moot, you can not win. You are just betting on bitmain being morons by giving you a profit.

A single transaction could open thousands of channels. Admittedly, you cant do 7 of those per second, but 7 TPS is misleading at best.


This is untrue. First of all, core doesnt decide this, anyone running their own node gets to decide. Secondly, almost no bitcoiner has ever said we would never increase the block size. Most are like me, we do not believe that  increasing the block size alone is a credible solution to the scaling problem and we do not want to hardfork to code that is forced upon us by miners, poorly tested and has no broad consensus. The decision to upgrade shouldnt be based on fees, but that doesnt mean we will never upgrade the blocksize.


The honest answer is that currently, we cant. No one else can though, not without sacrificing the values that made bitcoin unique.  How this will play out is simply unknown.  Maybe we do find solutions, maybe we need to keep using custodial solutions on top of bitcoin or on top of layers on top of bitcoin, or scalable hybrid systems that are backed by bitcoin (think DAI on ethereum, or fiat backed by gold), but anyhow it seems very likely pure bitcoin will ever be used by half the worlds population.

One satoshi is 1/100.000.0000th of a bitcoin. In the unlikely event one day that proves to be too much, we can trivially  further subdivide it via a softfork.  Call it a Nakomoto and price things in that.
Scaling transactions is still a largely unsolved problem.Layer 2 solutions like LN might be part of the solution, we may get layer 3 solutions, sidechains, and if/when technological progress allows it and/or if mining becomes much more decentralised, then larger blocks will also help.
Whether a combination of all those things would be enough is unknown. If its not, then its possible we may need offchain custodial solutions for some things.

I didnt try flashing the second one until either the first one was unbricked or my nano x arrived.
But my funds where never at risk, I had my seed, I tested my seed before moving all my crypto to it.  I was not worried about losing anything, just the inconvenience of not being able to access it.
And yes, obviously restoring the seed on the nano x worked, and I eventually managed to unbrick the nano S's by flashing the firmware on a different PC.

copy paste from Schneier:
One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than *kT*, where *T* is the absolute temperature of the system and *k* is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)
Given that *k* = 1.38 × 10\^−16 erg/K, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2 Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2 K would consume 4.4 × 10\^−16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.
Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21 × 10\^41 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7 × 10\^56 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured *all* its energy for 32 years, without *any* loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2\^192. Of course, it wouldn't have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.
But that's just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 10\^51ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.
These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that **brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.**

Depends  how you use it.  When receiving bitcoin, everytime you click on receive, you get a different address. But you can of course keep using the same address. When sending bitcoin, default behavior is sending everything from any given address, and sending the "change" back to a new address. This does not cause fragmentation.


Segwit using legacy addresses ( P2WPKH ) is more efficient than legacy addresses, and native segwit ( Bech32 ) is  again \~ 30% more efficient than P2WPKH, and thus cheaper to use. Not every service supports sending to bech32 though, but the same wallet can contain a mix of addresses.

You have that backwards. Its because the government creates laws that companies tend to follow because their CEOs dont like to go to jail.
If you let bitcoin be governed by any number or companies, you risk the exact same outcome, where governments impose rules to enfore AML/KYC,  deprive us of privacy or allow governments to block transactions or seize assets or even control inflation rate.
Right now, bitcoin miners do not control the consensus rules, they only order valid transactions. We can not give them more power if they are centralized, legal entities subject to government laws.

Doesnt matter once that cost becomes lower than the electricity cost of miners having to pay for their electricity.  And we are getting closer to that point every year, with efficiency improvements tapering off, meaning hardware depreciation costs can be written off over many years, and at some point, difficulty will catch up with asics demand, and prices will be close to manufacturing cost. At that point, I expect no miner can be profitable with 24/7 available energy from carbon burning sources.

Money is an accounting system, currency is the unit of account for that system. It only needs backing if your currency is not inherently scarce.  We used to back fiat with gold because fiat is not inherently scarce. Backing bitcoin, which is inherently scarce, is just as silly as backing gold. Or actually, even more silly as gold is not quite as inherently scarce as bitcoin.
Its \*value\* however, is entirely dependent on how much of their wealth people want to store in a given accounting system. Ignoring marginal industral demand, thats as true for gold as it is for bitcoin.  Of course bitcoin value is much less stable; its tiny in comparison, its a brand new concept and people still dont understand or trust it or even know what the heck it is. So of course its volatile. But that also means it has tremendous upside.
Note that you can build price stability on top of it, if you dont mind someone or something can adjust its supply. Have a look at DAI. Thats also basically the idea behind fiat, when it was backed by gold.  Fiat is therefore useful for commerce. We may one day have a stable coin on top of bitcoin, but just like fiat, that is not where you want to park your wealth.


Thats only because just a fraction of a percent of the world owns any bitcoin at all. Will that change? Buying bitcoin is betting on that. But no one knows for sure.

Because the mining hardware doesnt cost the vendors anywhere near what you pay for it, and if that machine would mine even close to  1 BTC, either more miners-who-cant-do-math will pay retail prices for more miners, or the miners themselves they will deploy more miners. Or both. You cant win. Not against miners who pay only a fraction of the price you do, and probably have cheaper electricity to boot.
Its been like this ever since the first asic. Only people who count in dollars and "profit" from the increasing btc price, think its profitable. Spend one BTC today,  mine 0.5 BTC over the next two years, but if bitcoin goes x3, they think they did well...

Yes, it will result in different private keys (and thus different addresses).


Your wallet may consist of a ton of addresses with tiny amounts each. Sending them all in one transaction will result in a large and thus expensive transaction. You dont pay fees per transaction, but per byte.  Segwit also needs less bytes. That said, I would double check your transaction in a block explorer and verify it did indeed use the same sats per byte.
 


Of course. In fact by default it will use a new address for every transaction. A deterministic seed generates a single wallet, but that wallets consists of unlimited number of private keys, and thus public keys.

It is concerning, but its both unavoidable and temporary. Its unavoidable if you want bitcoin to remain a peer-2-peer currency and not a peer-2-fake-satoshi's-datacenter currency. It currently takes a normal PC several weeks to download and verify the blockchain. Multiplying that by 8x is a terrible idea, especially because even 8x larger blocks will simply fill up with spam and other usecases anyway, and fees will be right back where they are today. And its temporary, because LN ought to take care of small or frequent transactions, and sidechains will eventually take care of the rest.

\&gt; At some point your'e going to let loose this idea that you're buying them in BTC.  
It doesnt matter what you buy them with. You buy a BTC producing machine. The only sensible way to calculate if that makes sense is comparing its mining revenue with the alternative way to obtain (or keep your) BTC. Ie, its market value.
Its like if you had a gold deposit in your backyard and had to decide to invest in gold mining gear. Yeah, you would probably pay for that in dollar, but if the mine produces less gold than you could buy with those dollars today, then it makes no sense, regardless of what gold price may do in the future. You are better off just buying gold directly.
Buying mining equipment was profitable (BTC denominated ) in 2017/18 because buying hardware at the peak of its price, to mine future BTC is essentially selling or shorting BTC. Of course, doing so was no where near as profitable as actually shorting BTC if you happen to get the timing just right.
Its the exact same flawed logic you apply when bitcoin rallies, and you revert to calculating your profit in dollars. Yes, if bitcoin goes x10 you probably will make a dollar denominated profit, but its still an utterly stupid thing to do because you will mine far less btc than you could have purchased. Or kept.

Fine, though I wouldnt trust my memory with that. Its fresh in your memory now, but after a few months of not using or checking your memory of the seed, chances you will forget or misremember are very high.


I just tried. Signed out of google, signed back in. No 2FA prompt. On a new device, it does prompt me. That may be a setting, but check it first. And if its not a throw away account, you'll be logged in pretty much all the time.


You can organise that anyway you want. The way I did, was giving pieces of the puzzle to various family members, so at least 2 would have to collude to steal my coins. I trust each of them individually with my life, so certainly with my private key (I just dont trust them to store it, or the acces to it securely), but if you dont then you can do a more elaborate Shamir Secret Share setup, or simply put the last piece of the puzzle in your will.


Anything can be lost. Your cloud storage certainly can. You can only opt for redundancy to reduce that risk.  As for being stolen, thats why you encrypt it and why I chose to add a layer of security thats extremely hard, if not impossible to breach for a random hacker, but should be solvable by someone with access to my financial statements and intimate knowledge of me, my family and our past. That eliminates 99.999% of all potential hackers.


That person would need to steal the puzzle first. IE, hack the email account(s) that stores it. IF he does that with yours, he's done. In my case, well, good luck to him.


My seed is encrypted in its entirety by a ridiculously long password. A hacker could obtain 10 of the 12 answers of my puzzle and bruteforcing it will still be all but impossible.

Also, at least with gmail's 2FA, you dont need the 2FA unless you are logging in from a different machine. If someone hacks your PC, the 2FA isnt needed.
FWIW, what I have done is encrypt my seed with a password that consists of a combination of words that is almost impossible for a random hacker to figure out, but that I know and my family knows or can find out. Things like my social security number + license plate of the first family car + nickname of that hot history teacher in highschool  + etc etc. A puzzle thats impossible to solve for a random hacker, and even someone in my family/friend will have to do some social engineering to obtain the answers, likely setting off alarm bells.

I dont follow and I suspect its because you dont really understand the issue. Let me say again, you cant change bitcoin's POW algorithm without a hardfork. No one can. If one day, we come to a consensus to change the PoW to something other than SHA, and thus fork bitcoin, it will presumably become something Bitmain can not mine. Thus can not 51% attack. They will be able to continue to mine the unchanged fork, lets call it bitcoin classic. But why on earth would they 51% attack that then?

Sigh. No, thats not how it works. "Remarkable energy efficiency" only leads to high hash rate, arguably high security, but pretty much nothing else. Bitcoin price and block reward dictate mining costs, not the other way around. Difficulty is just the arbitrator that keeps mining costs and revenue similar.

Who is "they" ? If you mean the government, when was the last time they defaulted on their bonds? Debt doesnt have to be paid back. It needs to be serviced. Interest payments is where the inflation comes from, not defaults (defaulting on debt is deflationary!).  Fiat money can not work without debt. It **is debt**. Usually someone else's debt, but debt nonetheless. If everyone, including the government would repay all their debt, there would be no more money.

Yes it is. fun fact, if you dont need 24/7 availability, and dont need to transport your energy very far, renewable energy is cheaper than any carbon based source. Even if that werent the case, its a pretty ridiculous statement, so Ill just sign off here.
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:18:09


Thats a ridiculous nonsensical argument. First of all, if you run a single 1000W miner, surely you ARE able to cover the electricity cost with fiat if you wanted to. A company with 10 of 1000's of miners, thats a different story, they DO need to sell BTC to pay the bills.
Secondly, if selling your BTC doesnt even cover your electricity cost, then you are not being profitable period. you can safely forget about recouping your investment and you would be better off unplugging the miner until the price recovers. Hanging on to mined BTC in hopes of price appreciation is completely identical to buying or hanging on to purchased BTC in hope of price appreciation. If you think BTC will go up, buy some. Dont invest in mining equipment or spend on electricity if that generates less BTC than your dollars would on an exchange. 
This kind of "thinking" IMO is the main reason why people are willing to pay ludicrous prices for miners. Ive seen it since the first asics where launched, people thinking they made a profit because their mined BTC went parabolic in value, and not realizing investing the same money in BTC directly would have usually earned them a high multiple of that. The reality is they lost on mining, as almost everyone paying retail prices for hardware has for almost the entire existence of asic miners, but people just fail to understand... Which is why I havent been able to leverage my free electricity for mining since 2012.

The downside is that it makes bitcoins scaling problem even larger, by having an even larger blockchain and still not nearly enough capacity. Dev team fully realizes that, and will address it by dropping PoW and switching to a PoS algorithm and sharding. The former comes with significant compromises in immutability and centralisation, the latter may introduce latency and possibly security concerns. That said, I dont think anyone questions that ethereum is useful, its just a different concept with different goals and different tradeoffs.
BTW, rootstock (RSK) brings smartcontracts and scaling to bitcoin, although as you might have guessed, it comes with its very own tradeoffs.

You cant detect the fork until after it gets published, and thus after the attack took place. Moreover, there is no mechanism to determine which fork is an attack, and which is the valid. The only rule is that the longest chain is valid. Start messing with that, and everything falls apart.

Why? Its exactly what that "buzzword" means: no centralized or trusted third party. Just like you dont need banks to hold your fiat account if you use a decentralised crypto currency, you dont need an exchange to hold your crypto balances and trades when you use a decentralised exchange - aka dex.
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:36:48
No, the contrary is true. on top of the double spend, you actually get to keep the blockreward, which reduces your costs. So if you can deposit/trade/withdraw $600K worth of bitcoin within an hour, it will be profitable, assuming you could somehow gain control of that much hashrate.
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:47:59
Not really what? Sure, there are plenty of bad examples of blockchain applications that would be better served by a database app (you know, like Neo ;) ), but there are also real usecases for **decentralised** blockchain solutions in supplychain and logistics. For instance, if you had looked at cargox for just 5 seconds, you'd have noticed the "bill of lading" document they are replacing, has much more in common with cash money than with anything else. in general, if the document has value (like money) and/or if there are many parties with competing interest or if there is a trust issue, there is a good chance a blockchain can make sense.
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:02:54


Not a chance in hell. Unless in 5 years, BTC is worth ~$0 or either the euro or the dollar goes to zero. With bitcoin, the difference between the most optimistic and the most pessimistic estimates is easily 5+ orders of magnitude, and neither position is completely unrealistic and neither possibility will completely go away.  Its going to keep doing random monte carlo walks between exuberance and panic. And maybe, we'll shave off one or two orders of magnitude in the different expectations, but to get single digit per year volatility, thats just not going to happen without some sort of "central bank", or a pretty universal adoption and expectations of future adoption/use cases. I certainly hope I wont be around to witness that, because it would also mean the end of innovation.
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:21:53
There is very little scale effect in mining. If one miner isnt profitable, than 1000 wont be either. What separates the ones being profitable from the ones that arent, is the cost of acquiring the hardware and writing off that cost. Which is peanuts for the manufacturer, a lot more for large industrial customers and insane for end users. I have access to free electricity, and it doesnt make sense to me to invest in miners, because the prices are so high I never expect to earn back the investment. And the only reason for that is a lack of supply and the fact people still cant do the math, understand exponential growth of difficulty and are willing to overpay.

Because doing everything in the base layer comes with its own compromises. Ethereum currently isnt very scalable, its blockchain is gigantic and bandwidth consumption already getting to the point where normal users cant run a node, even though it can barely handle a virtual cat game. Switching to PoS and sharding may solve those problem, but at the expense of immutability, decentralisation, cross chain latency and security. These compromises may be suitable or even inevitable for some use cases, but they are far from ideal for every use case.
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:29:33
Yes, entirely wrong. The reason they are switching to PoS and  sharding, is that can greatly improve scalability.  As for PoW centralisation; this isnt just about mining. You can own all the miners in the world, and you still wouldnt be able to control the consensus rules. You would be able to perform some "crypto terrorism" by doing double spends, which is a concern, but certainly not the only or even most important one. Also, the primary PoW mining resource is energy. Good luck buying that up.
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:07:08


But it isnt. You dont need new loans to create the money to pay interests. You need velocity. The premise of the intro movie is also incorrect, money isnt created out of thin air, the crisis wasnt caused by too much debt. If you are going to use that sort of arguments, you're not going to convince anyone with a clue.


Why then give false, easily refutable reasons? 
BTW, I dont support crypto because its deflationary (that is, if you even accept its deflationary because it wont be in my lifetime). If anything, I think thats a major flaw. What attracts me to it is that its trustless and permissionless.  Not that there is a fixed supply. That might make it a profitable investment, but also a bad currency.

No, only the math impaired idiot miner will spend more on electricity to mine less bitcoin than he could buy from an exchange. Everyone else will shut down their miner if their mining revenue doesnt even pay their electricity bill, and if they think BTC price will go up, they will just buy bitcoin cheaper from an exchange.
BTW, the idiot miner will not impact difficulty because his hashrate will be offset by many others who can do the math.

Money isnt created out of thin air. Its created based on debt, ie, a pledge to repay (its also destroyed as the debt is repaid, or defaulted upon).

Asic production volume will need to catch up with demand first. Or BTC price needs to go down. Not nearly enough asics are being produced to satisfy demand, and as a result, difficulty is still too low and asics are still (way) too profitable for now. Not for you and me paying retail prices, but for bitmain. Difficulty **growth** isnt even adjusting to a 70% or so BTC price drop, so I think it will be a year or two; maybe more, maybe less depending what BTC price does and if bitmain gets some meaningful competition.

We had 250K nodes in 2014, when the blockchain was ~20GB. Today, despite the spectacular growth in users and value, but with a blockchain thats  over 120GB we have actually lost 96% of those nodes, leaving us with well under 10K. Thats not an encouraging trend. Full nodes are critical to decentralisation and security. What do you think will happen when the blockchain is allowed to grow 8x faster? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:27:58
If you're investing in bitcoin because you think it will destroy the financial system, Id urge you to sell right now. Its not going to happen. Trustless public blockchains simply can not provide the scaling required to replace fiat/banks/credit cards/paypal/. Consortium blockchains might one day be able to deliver the required throughput, but then its not that different from today. Especially since much of the services the financial sector provides today, will always be needed (credit, insurance, safekeeping, mediation, ..). 
 I also dont believe for a second that a digital cash system (a cash transfer here means trading assets of value, like bitcoin, gold, and arguably fiat notes) can or should replace digital payment systems (which means trading IOUs). They complement each other, and its possible payment systems and IOUs will be built on top of something like bitcoin, but one isnt going to replace the other. After all, we need credit, and making credit tradeable is not a bad thing either.
That said, Blockchain technology is very likely to change the financial industry, which is already beginning to embrace it. But if you think its about to replace it, you're dreaming.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:22:01

@_date: 2017-08-16 15:00:07
I hope you dont think money creation under the gold standard, was somehow limited to or proportional to the amount of gold that was being mined or acquired by the central bank? Of course it wasnt. Whether now, or under the gold standard, IOU based money is always created based on a promise to repay. IE, on debt. Be it personal, companies, banks or government debt. Money == debt. And there is no hard limit to the amount of debt that can be taken on. A bitcoin based *IOU* would be no different. The only difference is that the issuer will promise to repay in BTC, rather than in gold, or in fiat.

Litecoin uses Scrypt as its mining algorithm. Im not sure if ethereum pools could easily 51% attack it using GPU's, as I dont know how much more efficient Scrypt asics are compared to GPUs. Its probably vulnerable, but not nearly as vulnerable as PoW tokens that share a mining algorithm (or mining hardware) with other chains that are much larger. Like all of bitcoin's forks (that still use SHA), and just about everything that is GPU mineable and isnt Ethereum.

Not a concern. SHA is open source, has been vetted and attacked by cryptographers from all over the world for decades now. More over, the NSA eats its own dog food. If they created or found a vulnerability in the hashing algorithm, they would be compromising their own communication and verification systems.
Lastly, even if they had a way crack SHA, what could they do to bitcoin? They could mine bitcoins a lot cheaper than anyone else. And thats about it. Given how widespread SHA usage is, Im pretty sure they would have better uses for this ultra secret hack, and would never risk exposing its existence by.. mining bitcoins.

It would take the brute force of a calculator. Ok, slight exaggerating, but a raspberry pi could probably do it in hours if not seconds. There are only 12x11x10x9... ie 12! combinations. Thats ~400M combinations.
A 12 word seed with a reasonable sized dictionary is like 10^38 possible combinations. Thats like a quintillion times more.

A mining farm with 30 percent hashrate has zero control over the network. Even a cabal of miners with 90+ percent of the hashrate has very limited control over the network. They can only double spend, which would be difficult to do profitably and be suicidal for their business.
However, a cabal that controls almost all nodes, gains complete control over the network, as they can change the consensus rules. Miners cant do that. Miners produce blocks that are verified by nodes, who will reject invalid blocks that dont conform to the rules. 
That is the issue. If you grow the blocksize to the exabytes needed to make onchain scaling to a global level possible, hardly anyone will run their own nodes. And those that do will gain tremendous power.
There is another reason the blocksize hasnt been increased (well, it effectively has due to segwitt). As trivial a change as that may seem, it requires a hardfork, ie, a change in consensus rules. In other words, it requires ALL nodes to agree to the new rules and upgrade to avoid the network splitting and getting bitcoin/bitcoin classic dramas. This is contentious, dangerous and so far in bitcoins history, we have not had a single planned hardfork. Temporary high fees because people where too lazy to upgrade to segwitt or because LN isnt quite ready yet, and provide a bandaid solution that fundamentally doesnt solve anything,  are not good enough reasons to do a hardfork.

Modern bitcoin asics are definitively profitable when you consider only electricity costs (assuming you dont pay extremely high rates). The problem is recovering the hardware investment. To make a very long story short: asics are still too expensive for retail miners.
GPU pricing is much less correlated with mining profitability. Because, you know, gamers want them too. Still, Id be wary investing in GPU mining right now, because once ethereum switches to PoS, the market will be flooded with GPU's, and remaining GPU minable chains difficulty will explode as miners look for something else to mine.
Feel free to mine with a GPU you already have or want for gaming, but anything else, you will be better off putting your money in the tokens directly.

@_date: 2018-06-05 21:44:51


Reread that slowly. You're basically saying that cheap hardware will make hardware more expensive.
Yes, there will be an equilibrium, but it will be an equilibrium close to zero electricity costs, because there is plenty of free/excess electricity production. Difficulty and hardware depreciation costs will adjust to that level.  
Assume for a second that asics cost nothing to produce. What will happen? The vendors will sell as many as they can at any price the market bears, starting high,  but difficulty will keep shooting up, reducing revenue until revenue matches grid electricity costs, and from then on, only people with access to free electricity will buy and deploy them. For others even a  free asic will not make sense to operate, as it would cost more to run than it mines. Asics will cost next to nothing to buy, so we will heat our baths with mining asics, and run them even a few months per year when we have excess solar electricity, because, why wouldnt you ?
But asics arent free to produce, and can not be sold at prices comparable to a water heater. So prices asics will keep dropping until we hit the marginal profitability of the asic vendor.  That will be the real floor. And my claim is that that price is low enough  compared to electricity, and thus difficulty so high, that it will not make sense to mine 24/7 with grid electricity. You may not use it to make coffee for 2 minutes per day, but right now, hardware depreciation cost over 12 months is roughly comparable to grid electricity cost over the same period. If hardware prices (per Watt) drop by a factor 5x, you're better off mining a few days per week with free electricity. If you can write off the hardware over 5 years rather than 1, then hardware costs are only a fraction of the grid electricity it will consume and intermittent mining with spare electricity will make financial sense long before that.

Why exactly is this a concern? Anyone is free to run a node, "stake" some bitcoin in channels and  charge whatever fees they want. The more nodes and funded channels there are, the better the network will work. Meanwhile LN client software will find the cheapest routes, and no one is forcing you to use a route if the fees are more than what you're willing to pay. Win win for everyone as far as I can see.

There is the additional passphrase someone else mentioned (but which you might forget, and which your successors may not know if you drop dead). But there is also no need to keep the seed in one place. Feel free to split it in parts and store it in different places. You can even apply Shamir Secret Sharing to it if you want, so you would need X out of Y parts to reassemble your seed.

Idiot miner you mean. Why spend $100 on electricity to mine x BTC, when $100 on an exchange buys you more than x BTC?
Even so, idiot miners will just drive up difficulty and drive out more rational miners even if those have lower operational costs. Unless *all* miners are "idiots", difficulty will still adjust to the point where on average, mining 1BTC costs ~1BTC.


Oh please. He's an idiot, ignore him.

Define dangerous. Was it dangerously cheap in 2010? If bitcoin price drops very far from its current levels, and it generates no worthwhile tx fees, then yes, at some point in the future it may become cheap to attck. But bitcoin will then also have proven a failure because no one seems to value the token or use the blockchain. It self regulates.

WTF? Of course it sounds like paypal. Escrow and mediation is a service, and often a desirable one. In fact, I hope paypal will one day offer mediation services for crypto, it could be a lucrative opportunity for them.
What you fail to see, is that this is entirely OPTIONAL. You only use escrow if both the seller and buyer want to use escrow and agree to a specific escrow agent. You can also pick whatever other escrow service you want. It can be "ebay" or some other mutually trusted third party. How is that not a free market solution? And why the fuck would you not want this **option** when you deal with an untrusted business partner? I used bitcoin escrow back in 2011 for deals on bitcointalk forum. I use it today on localbitcoins. Are you going to sell me bitcoins without escrow? I'll give you my address, Ill make you a really good price.

Earlier you claimed hardware prices would never become trivial compared to power consumption costs on the grid, now you are assuming it. 
My point of assuming free electricity was just to show that it would cause difficulty to keep going up, causing the revenue and thus value of asics to keep dropping, until they reach the point of marginal profitability for the manufacturer.  Thats whats going to set the price floor, and in return determine difficulty &amp; hashrate of the equilibrium. Excess/intermittent green energy capacity will just be added if need be.

Oh no they are not. Its not because until now your payments may not have been censored or your funds havent been frozen yet, that they are even remotely resistent to it. They quite obviously arent, your bank or government can freeze them at any point, for any reason.
You're also missing the bigger point: permissionless. You dont need anyone's permission to use the network and perform or accept payments. No ID required, no credit score, no nothing. Kind of a big deal for billions that have no access to banking services because they lack paperwork or banks dont service them, or that are cut off from most of the world due to capital controls or US sanctions or whatever.  
Permissionless isnt only about using the system, you also dont need anyone's permission to innovate and build applications on top of decentralised systems. No multi million dollar banking license required, no permission needed from banks or insurance companies or governments because you can build on top of trustless systems rather than having to depend on trusted institutions or trying to acquire trust yourself. This has the potential to bring enormous competitive advantages, I wrote a post about that here:

Im not worried. Layer 2 scaling (like Lightening network) and side chains (like rootstock) should solve any scaling issues, and we can even build additional layers on top of those. 10 years from now, I suspect regular users will rarely need to interact with bitcoin blockchain directly, but behind the scenes it will act as the ultimate immutable ledger and source of trust that powers several worldwide financial networks.

No, he buys for the purpose of increasing the price.  If he just wanted to own more bitcoin to sell later at a higher price, then by spreading the purchases over a day or a few days, he could have bought the same amount while barely moving the price at all.

Nope. You can buy miners with bitcoin if you already have them, and the story doesnt change. We're talking about the ROI. The return, which you have to measure in BTC, not in fiat. Bitcoin exchange rate only comes in to the equation if you speculate on a price increase, which is a terrible reason to buy a miner, because then you need to compare it to buying bitcoin directly. The ROI of a miner has to be measured in BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:44:22
Oh not this again. Mining cost is determined by....  the mining revenue. Yes, its a feedback loop that automagically creates an equilibrium through difficulty adjustment.  If bitcoin price halves, or block reward halves or tx fees collapse, the only result is that difficulty may go down.  Over a long enough period, mining will still be and **always will be**, marginally profitable for those with access to cheap hardware and electricity.
Mining was at least marginally profitable (for some) when bitcoin was at $2 and when it was $20000. When blockrewards where 50 BTC per block and when blockreward will be 0.05 BTC. When fees where pretty much zero and when they where insane.

Nothing new here. TL;DR we will need to add a QC proof signature algorithm (which can be done via softfork) and 'lost coins' might become recoverable.

but NO! Using fiat as reference is the exact opposite of what I say. You have to denominate your profits in bitcoins. A miner produces bitcoin. How many bitcoins does it mine? Thats the question. Contrast that with how many bitcoins your dollar buys.  In either case you will win or lose in dollars if btc exchange rate goes up or down, but thats what you have to ignore when considering a miner.

what are you talking about? The retail prices for these machines? They are just priced to what idiots will pay for them. And they are skyhigh because there are many idiots, and not many asic manufacturers with enough volume to satisfy idiot demand.


? This is my last attempt. Bitcoin mining is "money" in (both for hardware and electricity), bitcoins out. That means the dollar value of the output is inherently tied to the BTC exchange rate, which is unknowable.  Exactly like when buying BTC directly. So if you want to be exposed to future BTC exchange rate, you have the choice: either you buy (or hodl) bitcoins or you buy miners. The choice that puts out the the most coins for the smallest investment, that is what you want.  So you denominate the ROI in bitcoin. It couldnt be simpler. Of course, who knows what that will end up being in fiat, but that risk is pretty much the same for retail miners and investors, though investors have the added benefit of having more liquidity, if the market turns against them, they can sell their coins faster and easier than a miner can sell his unprofitable hardware.

ethereum has infinite inflation, I dont see too many people taking issue with that. Bitcoins issuance and 21M limit may have been necessary in the beginning to help understand the concept of digital scarcity, but it really shouldnt be a central pillar, and if the choice one day becomes either &lt;1% inflation or a vulnerable network, then its not a difficult choice for me. Gold is inflationary too, each year we mine another 1-2 percent.  As long as the inflation is clearly defined and low enough percentage, what is the problem ?

It scares me when people think bitcoin is the solution to a problem that they do not understand. There isnt "more debt than cash". Every dollar represents exactly one dollar of someone else's debt. Its called credit money for a reason; it is created based on debt (personal, corporate or government, through loans and bonds) and works just like a double accounting system, where debit == credit. Saying there is too much debt is the exact same thing as saying there is too much money. 
What can be a problem is too much **bad** debt  (which ironically, works deflationary, as defaulting on loans destroys money and reduces the circulation, increasing its value).  I see no evidence that is the case now. Yes, you have a government that is running pretty high and escalating deficits, which could become problematic and could become bad debt. But that is solved relatively easily by raising taxes. Or more correctly: actually collecting taxes at least a bit closer to statutory rates, particularly for corporations and the 1%. And no, that isnt going to destroy the economy, quite on the contrary they pay far lower taxes now than they did in the booming 50s and 60's. High marginal tax rates provided an incentive for corporations to invest their profits in expansion, R&amp;D, or reward their employees with higher salaries, otherwise, the money simply went to the government. Now, they just park the profits on offshore bank accounts, or pay dividends and bonuses which does nothing for the economy.
Alternatively, you could sell a few aircraft carriers and invade fewer countries, that should probably fix the deficit problem too.
Mind you, Im not saying fiat has no problems that need fixing, some of which bitcoin could help with. But "too much debt" isnt one of them.

But it is. Basically all our fiat money is created from debt. You go to the bank and take out a mortgage of  $1M, the bank creates that money,  based on your pledge to repay it. Governments do it by lending form the central bank.  You can not have fiat money without debt. You cant eliminate debt without wiping out all money that represents that debt.


Thats not quite how it works. Negative interest rates means banks are charged interest rates to hold their reserve money at the central bank, rather than getting interest paid. But you are right that interest rates is the core problem, rather than debt, particularly government debt. Money is way too cheap and causing price bubbles and malinvestment.

If the intent of the open market purchase (or sale) is to affect the market price, its pretty much by definition manipulation:
*Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the “Exchange Act”) prohibits the use of “any
manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance”
in contravention of SEC rules.7
 The term
“manipulative” is “virtually a term of art when used
in connection with securities markets. It connotes
intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive
or defraud investors by controlling or artificially
affecting the price of securities.”*
*The SEC has historically

You dont seem able to read what I write. The articles lays out the problems with PoS, which I agree with. Most of them boil down to not having a trustless oracle to store and retrieve checkpoints in black swan event. If you store them in bitcoins blockchain, you eliminate that problem.


Dude, thats not what Im saying at all. However, if ethereum PoS stores checkpoints in bitcoin's blockchain, its not fundamentally different from what rootstock already does. Yes, if you wanted to, you could then consider that ethereum becomes a "sidechain of bitcoin", just like rootstock is typically described as a sidechain. Or you could call it a layer on top of bitcoin. Thats semantics. In either case transactions happen off-bitcoin-chain, but the bitcoin blockchain is where the ultimate settlement or dispute resolution happens. And instead of storing them in the blockchain direclty, you could probably use LN to update ethereums chain states offchain. That would be one hell of a nice use case for LN submarine swaps.

No it doesnt.  Fiat money is debt. Governments create money by taking on debt. It needs to be serviced, not repaid.  If governments would repay their debt, the only logical conclusion is that households and/or companies would need to take on more debt, or money would need to be destroyed. Its nonsensical. Debt is not a problem, its the same as money.  When was the last time anyone said "we have too much money"?
The only problem is **bad** debt, which is money that represents wealth that does not exist. And that is our current problem, the ridiculously low interest rates causing bubbles and tons of bad debt.

Indeed. The goal is obviously to encourage banks to spend, invest or lend our their money. But when there is no good way to invest that money, then this policy of cheap money creates the real problem: asset bubbles, and it encourages malinvestment and lets be honest, pure gambling by the banks.  We need higher interest rates to ensure money is only invested in things that are more likely to provide a return. Interest rates is our real problem,  the amount of debt that is taken on to make bad investments. Not so much the absolute amount of debt, that really doesnt even mean anything.
Oh, btw, and a much better way to stimulate the economy would be to create money and give it directly to consumers and let them spend it, or repay debts since clearly the banks have no clue what to do with it. Universal Basic income, it really makes more sense than this.

This has nothing to do with nodes. A 51 percent attack still conforms to the consensus rules. It just produces a different blockchain conforming to the rules.  It is a concern, but largely overblown as it would be exceptionally difficult to do a profitable double spend of bitcoin of that magnitude, and it would kill the miners business instantly.  Its a suicide attack more than anything.

Not me. But its the price they are charging NOW, and Im looking at this from the perspective of a miner, considering buying now. And you're making my case for me. A price war will lead to a difficulty explosion (provided they can manufacture enough), which will further decrease market value and thus price, which will...  To quote myself: " the problem for miners will be the self reinforcing interaction between increasing difficulty and dwindling hardware prices, which will stretch that 345 days ROI towards infinity".

I think most alts that claim or aim to replace bitcoin are doomed to fail. I would make an exception for privacy coins like monero or zcash that do have a real reason to exist, but arguably only until bitcoin gains greater anonymity.  All those zero fees coins and all the forks, ignore them. 
then there are the smart contract platforms, like ethereum. I think they are worth an investment, the use cases are real enough, but in the long run, much of their functionality could be incorporated in to bitcoin or on top of bitcoin. And just like I doubt there is a good reason for a zillion currencies, there is no good reason for a zillion smart contract platforms, so only a few will survive.  Ethereum is currently your best and safest bet here, but I think cardano has a shot at dethroning it eventually. 
And then there are the utility tokens. They are even more volatile and risky than bitcoin or SC platforms,  many are utter junk and most are ridiculously overpriced, but some of them have real potential. So it all depends how much risk/reward you are willing to shoulder.
As for what Im doing; roughly 25% pegged to fiat (fiat itself, DAI, gold, ..) 25% BTC, 10% ethereum and the rest in alts.

Yes, and dont believe the bcashers who say it doesnt matter. It certainly does matter. Full nodes act as checks and balances on miners, verifying that the blocks miners produce conform to the consensus rules. Bcashers will tell you you can simply trust miners to verify their own blocks because bitmain would never cheat and never change the consensus rules, although they have tried so many times already.

It appears he defrauded Kleimans estate by stealing a bunch of bitcoins Kleinman mined before his death, but its unclear how many there where.  Its even less clear if faketoshi still owns any.


I dont think its even proven Kleinman ever knew faketoshi. After Kleinman died, faketoshi produced a ton of fake emails and forged contracts to "prove" co-ownership and control over a trust Kleinman allegedly set up, but to date Ive not seen any real evidence the two even knew each other.
There is also only scant evidence kleinman even owned any non trivial amount of BTC. He died in abject poverty and was being foreclosed upon.

Thats absolutely correct. However, that only reinforces my point. The chip may be competitive for 5 years or more, that doesnt mean its economically viable today at the current prices. If prices per TH are going to fall by a factor 5x or more, as I expect, difficulty for any given bitcoin price will go up by at least a factor 5x and ROI period at current prices will stretch beyond infinity.

No too mention all the chains that plug in to or do merged mining with bitcoin. Elastos, Komodo, Rootstock, .. I see bitcoin becoming a universal settlement layer for a significant portion of the ecosystem. Anything that needs anchors or state blocks or similar tricks they use to protect them from double spend or nothing at stake attacks, need a trustless oracle, and there is no better solution for that than bitcoin. Ethereum plasma IMO could even benefit from this.
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:45:54
But who can? For bitcoin and any PoW token that is not GPU mineable or not rentable through nicehash, you need to acquire the hardware first, and that is going to cost many orders of magnitude more than the 1hr cost listed on the website.
The bottom line is pretty simple: in the foreseeable future bitcoin will only become vulnerable to a cheap attack if it has a very low value. Which kinda makes sense ;)
Now how things wil work out 50 years from now, who knows, Im not losing sleep over that just yet and Im sure we will have time to come up with a solution if there needs to be one. Miners may just increase minimum fees they mine or even hardfork creating a fork with higher and perpetual block reward, and that fork may remain secure and the market will figure out if a tiny inflation rate is better than high fees or a vulnerable network.

As we transition towards 100% renewable energy, we will need MASSIVE overcapacity to handle peaks loads, as storing energy is incredibly expensive and inefficient.  Peak capacity needs to be a high multiple of average load, which means most of the time, there will more excess "free" electricity than there is overall capacity now. Are we going to exhaust that? 
But if we  do, or we drive up the value high enough, then we can always increase the capacity of cheap electricity, and thats exactly what Im predicting. Bitcoin miners will install solar plants and wind farms. They will mine when demand is low, and will sell their electricity to the grid when demand is high. Thats not feasible now because miners need to run 24/7 to have a chance of earning back the hardware investment. Once hardware costs become trivial compared to the energy cost (at grid prices), all that changes.

Considering its only barely more efficient than the 16nm S9, and I dont think &lt;5nm is even on the horizon, lifespan may be considerably more than 5 years. Unless bitmain manages a 7nm asic thats much more efficient.
If not, then problem for miners will be the self reinforcing interaction between increasing difficulty and dwindling hardware prices, which will stretch that 345 days ROI towards infinity, but hey maybe in a year or so, it will finally make sense for me to buy an asic to monetize my excess free energy.

Dear God. What happens if bitcoin crashes to zero tomorrow? Your entire business runs on producing bitcoin. Its a bitcoin frigging mine.  Its money in, bitcoin out. Whether or not you sell those to pay equipment,  employees and taxes. You put millions of dollars in and got out far less bitcoin out than anyone simply buying them on an exchange. Regardless if they sold some to pay taxes or lambos. And just like  virtually every bitcoin asic miner in history.  Its. not. that. difficult. to understand.


WTF? I just gave you the numbers, I linked some articles. Its scale completely and utterly dwarfs all of bitcoin mining. It is available, those wind turbines and solar panels do exist. You can go visit them, hop on a plane and admire our 1000s of idle wind turbines on sunny and windy days. Its just not profitable yet to use them part time because difficulty is still too low as asics are still too expensive because morons like you overpay for them with a smile. But given that your hardware and electricity costs are already pretty much in balance, its really not very difficult to predict the very near future. Of course, you have to understand the impact of meaningless metrics like their ratios, so well if may be too hard for you?


Lets see. Lets assume I ordered an Antminer T17 today. August batch. Lets assume it actually gets delivered on august 15th (not a snowballs chance in hell of that actually happening) and I can mine at 40TH/s with no electricity cost.  Give me your best estimate how many bitcoins I will mine over the next 3 years. Or just 1 year. So I can bookmark this and throw it in your face. Feel free to simplify, just give your expectation of difficulty at that time, and average % increase going forward.

That most definitely was not true historically and doesnt even begin to explain its current value. More over, if gold actually became useful as a raw material, then its increasingly useless as a store of value or currency. A currency that appreciates or depreciates in value just because of changing demand for industrial applications is a terrible currency. And it also hurts the industries where gold would otherwise be useful, when its in short supply just because we use it to store our wealth in it. A good currency has no intrinsic value.
As to the next few paragraphs.. I dont understand what counterpoint you are trying to make. Im not arguing for a return to gold. Im using historical gold to illustrate the problems of a deflationary currency. And yes, governments did hoard it and regulate it and control it. For the same reasons governments do now with our fiat, to control inflation. As just like now, they were not always very good at it. But deflation is unavoidable when economies grow faster than their monetary supply. Governments had no way to stop it, they couldnt print gold. Coinage and clipping etc could only buy them some time until the coins eventually lost their value anyway.


Thats just completely wrong when you look at it over centuries and continents. Governments can temporarily hoard or spend gold in their own country to try and control supply and the economy, they cant make it out of thin air and they didnt accumulate ever increasing quantities over centuries, on the contrary, they where usually broke as they had to spend to pay for their armies and castles and feudal system. 


Thats the most silly thing I read all day. It shows you fundamentally do not understand deflation. 8 years ago I couldnt even buy a bottle of coke with 1 BTC. Today I can buy a new motor cycle with it. That is deflation. And its not because i can divide my bitcoin in 100M satoshis that deflation goes away. I still want to hoard BTC because I hope that same 1 BTC may one day buy me a really nice new car. Who knows, maybe a house. 
If bitcoin was our main currency, the economy would collapse, because no one would spend. It doesnt matter that you can divide it.  If I had a factory, I wouldnt even buy raw materials with btc, because the profit margin on my finished goods could be smaller than the appreciation of my money. I would just close it down, go home and watch netflix while looking at my blockfolio. OF course, everyone would do that, until the economy does indeed come to a standstill and deflation eventually stops because the economy tanks. Fixed supply currency is ideal for a 0% growth rate economy and its exactly what it will result in. Which is kinda bad, especially if meanwhile your population would grow. It means everyone gets poorer on average.
Inflation OTOH, grows the economy. You can not sit on your money forever, it will not increase in value, in fact it has an expiration date. That encourages spending, encourages people to become or remain productive, and find ways to earn money to replace the value of the money they lost due the inflation. It also encourages people to invest money in promising enterprises that can provide returns. Deflation does the opposite of all that.
On this sub, people love to hate fiat and inflation. And Im fine blaming banks or governments for bad monetary policy or corruption. It might even be a good idea to replace it with an algorithm. But the reality is that controlled inflation is only "bad" for the individual (especially if you have a lot of money); that also applies to me; I would rather hold bitcoin myself than fiat, and perhaps get rich doing nothing productive. But at the same time, inflation is a necessity for a functional economy. Bitcoin will not and can not become our primary form of money when its supply can not adapt to the economy.


Its quite the opposite. Stealing the labor of others is exactly what deflation does. Assume bitcoin becomes the world currency, and thus represents the entire world economy. I am satoshi. Every year the world economy grows (lets assume it could, when using bitcoin) I get richer. Without doing a damn thing. Where does that wealth come from? From people actually producing goods and services that grow the economy. Inflation is like a tax on money,  that benefits the poor at the expense of the rich. But deflation is a tax on productivity that benefits the rich at the expense of everyone else. I just have to look at myself. I got significantly richer these past 8 years. What did I do for that? Nothing, I hodled my btc. I hodled it enough that I probably no longer need to work. And if bitcoin keeps going up, i get richer and richer doing nothing productive. Its good to be me, but its bad system.
It gets even worse when you consider credit in a deflationary system. I have a good business plan and want to build a factory but I have no bitcoin. I go ask Satoshi. He is not too interested because he gets richer every year without any risk or work. He is certainly not going to lend me bitcoin if he cant make a good profit from it, so he wants more bitcoin in return. That means he profits not only from my enterprise because I grow the economy and thus the value of his existing coins, he also collects interests bitcoins which are not created. So he gets a bigger and bigger slice of the entire and fixed supply of bitcoin *and* each bitcoin becomes worth more as long as the economy grows. At the expense of everyone else. Its obvious that doesnt work.
With inflation, even satoshi would be keen to lend me bitcoin because his wealth would decline if he did nothing. He will still ask me for interest, but now everyone with money will want to invest in me because they all want to maintain their wealth. So I can bargain and will end up paying an interest rate thats more or less in line with inflation plus the risk of my project. More over, the money to pay for that interest is created (its what created the inflation) so  Satoshi, if he makes good choices in his investments or lending, will simply maintain his share of the pie, possibly even grow it, but only by being productive and supplying capital and picking good projects. If he does nothing, he or his offspring will eventually lose his wealth. Thats a much saner system.

A majority or minority of nodes doesnt really have a meaning, aside from the risk of an eclipse attack, which DistinctSituation explained pretty well see above.
All you need to protect yourself from a consensus change you do not agree with, is running one node. If bitmain or coinbase launches a million nodes on amazon, its still not going to fool my node in to accepting their new rules and I wont be fooled in to accepting their token as a bitcoin.


Two ways, it makes an  eclipse attack more difficult,  see above, and it ensures users cant get tricked in to accepting an altcoin as if it where bitcoin. To do a successful hardfork, **every node** on the network has to agree and upgrade or the network splits. If only bitmain and coinbase ran full nodes, they could change the rules and every light client would accept their "bitmainbasecoin" as if it were bitcoin. Running your own node means choosing which fork you follow.

Its unbelievable how tenacious this is. I'll try again. Why spend $100 on electricity to mine x BTC, when $100 on an exchange buys you more than x BTC? (*)
But when I say mining 1 btc will cost ~1 BTC, mining cost isnt just electricity. Mining cost is hardware depreciation + electricity cost. Turning off your miner wont lower your hardware depreciation cost. Any rational miner will take that into account before ordering equipment.
IOW, rational miners will stop adding hashrate well before expected overall profitability approaches zero. They will continue mining as long as it is operationally profitable (ie, revenue &gt; electriciticy) even if overall they may be losing money due to the hardware cost, but they will all turn off their miners once revenue &lt; electricty.
So yes, on average, mining cost (hardware + elec) will always cost ~1 BTC to mine 1 BTC. Of course that average includes manufacturers  who buy hardware at production cost and have access to cheap electricity, as well as morons who cant do math and even mine at an operational loss due to their high electricity cost. It will still average out for as long as there are rational miners.
(*) Edit: some people may mine at an operational loss because they feel it secures the network, or because they enjoy the experience, or because they solo mine and see it as a lottery ticket. Thats fair enough, I wouldnt call them idiots. But unless literally everyone mines at a loss for some reason, then it doesnt change the market dynamics at all. More irrational miners will simply cause difficulty to stay higher, causing more rational miners to unplug.
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:57:09
Its never going to be all the hashrate, if no one else mines it, then I will, and I bet I wont be alone. And would you rather have a network that slows to a crawl until the next difficulty adjustment, or one thats been hijacked with new rules that you never agreed to?
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:14:54
No, thats just bad logic, not every statement needs to be reversible to be true. The reason why a shrinking money supply is bad for the economy is not direct. If an atomic bomb would wipe out half the population and half the worlds physical wealth, shrinking the monetary supply wouldnt hurt the economy for the survivors. But if no real world wealth is destroyed, a shrinking monetary supply would cause deflation and reduce velocity and reduce productivity.  It takes away all the incentives for people with wealth to be productive, or to lend or invest and it automatically leads to perpertual cycle of increasing concentration of wealth. 
And yes, some economists will claim deflation isnt bad, I dont subsribe to that view, and no one has ever given me an example where fixed, let alone shrinking monetary supply allowed for economic growth. Gold doesnt count, gold supply historically has been highly inflationary, and its still inflating by 2% per year.

CFTC has almost identical rules:
§ 180.2 Prohibition on price manipulation.
It shall be unlawful for any person,
directly or indirectly, to manipulate or
attempt to manipulate the price of any
swap, or of any commodity in interstate
commerce, or for future delivery on or
subject to the rules of any registered
entity. 
If anything, glancing over the CFTC rules in regards to price manipulation, they are even broader than the SEC rules they are based upon.
It also doesnt matter where the "victims" are located, what matters is where the manipulation took place. Now that probably is also largely outside of the US, but most countries have similar rules.
Lastly, this all started because you objected to me calling this manipulation. It is manipulation if the goal of the open market trades is to move the price (and profit from this price change); I think we both agree that is the case, regardless of legal and ethical considerations .

Finally, someone who gets that!


Hmm, not really. Cheaper miners are better though. And by cheap I mean cost per W they consume. If or when we get that low enough that the hardware depreciation cost over its useful lifetime is trivial compared to its electricity costs, then things get interesting, because it will make sense to mine part time, monetize excess (green) electricity and that will do wonders both to decentralization and lowering bitcoin's carbon footprint (even making it net negative). But as long as miners are expensive to write off, regardless of their efficiency, the manufacturers have a too high advantage to compete with and it doesnt make sense to mine part time. So you get centralised mining powered by relatively expensive but 24/7 available coal/gas/oil based electricity.

Price is latest actual sell. Even if all BTC get sold, someone can an put an order for, say, 100K but it wont be filled until someone sends some btc and actually sells it for that much.  So to answer your question, in the extremely unlikely case coinbase btc supply dries up, trading would simply stop until someone moves more btc to sell. In reality, there are plenty of people who have btc there that are not in the orderbooks, but will gladly sell for an absurd price and do arbitrage.

When you buy (or sell) not for the purpose of owning bitcoin, but solely to move the price to a certain point, then its manipulation.  No one sane would place a market order that moves the price up 5% just because he wants the bitcoin within a few minutes.

Your post and my edit crossed, so I may partially repeat myself here;


That is correct, but like I edited, its only when you produced, or committed  to produce the same value that I had produced to the economy, that the amounts of coins each of us had again accurately and fairly reflected real value. However, what if there was a third person, who also had 500 coins and did nothing? His net worth would have shot up from 1 goat initially to 33 goats, due to our labor.  A forth person who had no coins, but only a goat, gained nothing.  Its like socialism that redistributes actual economic growth to people with many coins.
A much more reasonable approach is creating new money that reflects the now larger economy. Then you and me would be fairly compensated for our efforts, without subsidizing the lazy bum with his 500 coins. He would still only be able to buy 1 goat from us.


Nor are the coins. Nor should they be. Its merely an accounting unit, money serves to represent value, things you trade for things of value, it shouldnt be the value itself. 


Thats where interest rates come in. No one will borrow money for free when its value goes down over time, so anyone with debt will need to repay his debt plus interest. Interest rates and inflation are closely linked together, so the net effect is that debtors debt remains relatively constant in real world value but it will go up when denominated in fiat currency.
Likewise anyone with lots of money can lend out his money to earn interest rates which mitigates most if not all of the loss in value. But to do so, he will need to take some risk and actually participate in the economy, selecting good and bad investments and thus also help the economy by providing credit where its productive.


Thats simply untrue. Deflation leads to never ending concentration of wealth by people who have money, deflation leads to the opposite. 
As for who should benefit; ideally no one would benefit directly from monetary policy. Only those that actually create goods and services that grow the economy should benefit proportionally to their contribution. But when as a society we want to prosper and grow our economy, then inflation encourages that. You can not sit on your money, instead you have to participate in the economy by investing or buying and selling goods and create new value or you end up broke. 
Deflation does the opposite; it discourages trading money for goods/services  and incentiveses people to sit on their wealth, even if that is inherited wealth,  rather than take part in the economy, and it lets them profit unfairly from the work of those how have no money but do grow the economy. This gets even more absurd and unfair if you look at long time effects over many generations. You pretty much end up in a feudal system again.

First of all, why are you assuming Im american? Im not, Im in the EU as you are.
But indeed, if a swiss organisation offers something to a german buyer, and not to US investors, the SEC doesnt care one bit. They regulate the US security market. However, your BaFin, which regulates the German securities market does or should care, as at the very least the issuer should submit a prospectus to them before being allowed to sell securities in the German market.

The main advantage of a hardware wallet is that you can use ot to sign transactions without having to trust your computer to be secure. If its just for long term storage, its really not very different from a paper wallet. At most you could say its easier to safely create an offlline wallet/seed and its easier to spend at some point. But while stored, they are equally secure (or insecure in the case of fire or loss, so you need backups in either case etc).
To answer your questions; you can recover your wallet from your seed using any hardware wallet or even software wallets. Its not a problem if ledger goes out of business

You sound confused. Blocks form a chain. Nodes (anyone running bitcoin client) verify each and every block to see if the blocks conform to the consensus rules. If they do, then they are valid. If they dont, then they are rejected. There is no fake chain. If someone presents a larger \*valid\* chain,  than that chain will be accepted. But the only way to create a larger valid chain is spending more energy than all off the rest of the network combined over the period where you want to change the chain. And  remember, even then that chain still has to conform to the rules set by the nodes, and so all transaction in that chain will still need to valid bitcoin transactions with valid signatures.

But bitcoin price doesnt and didnt stay the same! You can not calculate mining profits based on wishful thinking exchange rates. You can HODL your BTC mining revenue, but then you are no different than any other HODLer who may win or lose by doing so. Except, you paid far more fiat money for your BTC than anyone who bought them on an exchange.


YES! YES. Now you got it! At least part if; mining indeed produces *crypto currency*, not fiat. Bravo. So now calculate how much you paid for that cypto. Oh, you just did.
And what you conveniently ignore here is that the real problem is the cost of the conversion tools and the time they are productive. Those alone historically and currently eat almost all your mining revenue, any electricity cost on top of that, is typically your net loss, when you denominate it in crypto. If and when those tools become cheap enough not to play a major role,  iow, when that "useless" $/W ratio drops far enough, which could be soon, then mining will indeed essentially become converting electricity in to crypto, I fully agree. And then you will not be able compete with your always available 5c/KwH against abundant and already existing intermittent excess renewable electricity. Let alone, negatively priced energy.
here is another link for you:
100M GBP per year for not putting wind energy on to the grid. Thats ~$125M per year in free electricity from existing infrastructure that could be used for mining. In the UK alone, from wind alone. And the UK isnt even close to Germany or many other countries when it comes to renewable energy.

With asic mining, unless you build your own devices, you stand virtually zero chance to earn back the hardware investment, even if you had free electricity.  Difficulty will explode as 7nm ASICs come online in volume. You might make a **dollar** denominated profit but only if bitcoin price also goes up by a lot. Here is what mining really does: you pay, say, $12K  (or whatever todays btc price) in hardware and electricity, and you will mine anywhere between 0.5 and 0.8 BTC over the next few years. And mining morons will claim that is profitable when in 2 years 1 bitcoin is worth $25K.
I can do better for you; send me 12K today, and I will give you 0.9 BTC spread over two years. Or even immediately if you want. Lets call it accelerated high yield mining.
GPU mining might give you better odds, as the price of the hardware isnt determined by the biggest idiots who dont understand exponential difficulty growth, but largely by supply and demand by gamers. GPUs also retain their value much better.

Ask him what he thinks money is first. See if he grasps its just an accounting system based on some scarce good, that can be a physical good (like gold) or a mostly digital one (our fiat bank accounts).
Bitcoin is free software and in essence it is little more than a distributed database with accounts, not unlike your bank has a database with accounts. It has its own unit of account which can not be created at will like fiat; instead it has a hard fixed supply;  even more so than gold.
Unlike fiat , and somewhat like physical gold,  this database is trustless, meaning it is not governed by anyone, can not be tampered with by anyone, no one controls its rules,  its supply or who uses it how when or why. It exists throughout the internet, there is no database to hack, and no database operator (bank) you have to trust or who can be coerced.
Its an open protocol, like the internet itself, meaning anyone can transact or receive without any corporation, bank or government sitting in the middle or giving their permission.

Zero conf is fine in some circumstances where the risk of a double spend attack is  just too small to worry about; like in a physical transaction (the proverbial coffee payment), where you cant time the attack, and the amount is too low to ever be worth it.

Oh, but they will embrace crypto. Just not decentralized crypto that they can not control. 
Expect them to first build alternatives that are are under their control, as they are already doing. Libra, JPmorgan coin, Swift, arguably ripple, ...  they are all dong "blockchain". But then at some point they or governments will complain that systems like bitcoin dont play by the same rules, can be used for money laundering and to fund terrorism, and they will try to crush it. And if Im honest, i give them fairly good odds of succeeding, At least in crushing its value and adoption.


Governments IMO havent yet understood the implications of decentralised crypto. They are as always, slow to respond. That doesnt mean they wont.

I beg to differ.  Lets first agree that gold has very little intrinsic value. You cant eat it, you cant grow it, its not particularly useful for industry; lead or iron are much more useful.  Its just scarce and durable and divisible and therefore a useful representation of real world wealth that can be used for trade. It has all the traits that make it a good form of money. If we discovered that antartica is made of pure solid gold, its not going to do anything for us as a society, we wont all suddenly be rich and stop working and drive in Teslas and own castles. It would just devalue gold, thats all. We would be better off if we found antartica was covered by Teslas and robots and solar panels and actual stuff of value. Agreed?
Then understand gold  has no hard fixed supply. Even today we still mine 1-2% per year, and that was a lot more when it was our main currency. Usually we mined enough to allow its supply to keep pace with economic growth. 
But when gold got too scarce, as in, the economy grew faster than the gold supply, also known as deflation, that actually was problematic. People would hoard it, they wouldnt spend it. The wouldnt lend or invest. Trade would suffer greatly, particularly if you realize how long it took a boat to china or india and back. 
How did we solve it?  We invented paper money, bank notes date back to the days of Marco Polo. But also, we went to war and stole other countries gold. Like when Spain plundered south america. That was a huge boon to the entire european economy. Why? Like I said before, gold has very little intrinsic value. Its not the thing of value, like every good form of money its just what we use to represent value. So if gold is your money, then plundering foreign gold is not different from printing paper money. So how did that help? Simply the fact there was more of it, it was the fact we increased the money supply that allowed the economy to flourish. If you think about it, yes that is *insane*. can you imagine ancient tribes going to war over the pebbles or feathers or seashells that they chose as their form of money? We did that, we actually fought wars to get our hands on yellow stuff that had no good practical use, but that we happened to have chosen as as a unit of account once we didnt have enough to represent our growing economies. We either needed more useless yellow stuff, or our economies suffered greatly.
I love bitcoin as much as anyone, but its fixed supply is a mistake. I might profit it from it personally, but as a currency its a bad idea.

I dont quite agree with your premise. I think its closer to the truth to say bitcoin was created to have a system that is free of financial *governance,* replacing politics and delegation of power and trust with an algorithm that is ungoverned and thus incorruptible.

\&gt; there is no way that every nation state in the world tries to shut down bitcoin
There is actually. Not individually one by one, but there are plenty of suprenational financial institutions like the IMF and what have you.
More over, the US alone has so much influence over the entire fiat system (ask Iran) that if they ban bitcoin and say its used for terrorism funding or whatever, that fiat on/off ramps will close pretty much all over the world and doing transactions anywhere would become seriously dangerous. They can cut off iran with a stroke of the pen, despite EU, China, Russia and many other countries wishes. They can certainly cut off BTC, and very few countries would even want to resist.
\&gt; "by the people, and for the people" they say. remember that?

If you are fascinated by how it actually works, and not just by its potential to make you rich,  I would go with the full bitcoin core client. Provided you have sufficient disk space and fast/unmetered internet. That way you not only get a wallet, you also have a full copy of the blockchain and run a full validation node to participate in the network. And a rich set of API and console commands to play with if you want to dive under the hood. Initial sync may take over 24 hours though.
If you want something that works quickly and doesnt eat resources, electrum is a good choice. Especially if one day you decide to use a hardware wallet to secure your private keys. But electrum, like all light clients, will use its own centralized servers for validation of transactions.  Thats fine for "play money" and when kicking the tires , but something to be mindful of.

After 10 years, miners still dont understand mining. Mining is a  zero sum game, a race to the bottom. If its profitable for you, then its more profitable to someone else who has access to cheaper mining equipment or cheaper energy. And those people will expand their mining, difficulty will go up, your "profit" will evaporate.
The main reason this isnt happening as fast as it could is because mining hardware takes time to be produced and deployed or its availability is being restricted by bitmain and co who do their own mining. This shortage of mining gear inflates its market prices, so you get shafted upon buying your gear rather than by exploding difficulty.
As it stands, even with free electricity, you are not likely to recuperate your mining equipment investment (and hydro is far from free, that turbine wont last forever). Not when you calculate your costs and revenue in the only way that is sensible, by calculating it in BTC, not in fiat. Your machines produce BTC, so spending 10 BTC today to mine 9 BTC in the future is a bad deal no matter what BTC price does.
If you had access to mining equipment at production cost, it would be profitable if you also had access to energy at way below market prices. But if you do, you might be better off selling the bulk of that electricity back to the grid. And possibly mine only when the grid has surplus capacity and you cant sell your production. That only makes sense with cheap mining hardware though, so is not yet feasible unless you produce your own ASICs.

Kraken is quite possibly the best exchange around. Not exactly the nicest  interface, but thats not so important. Remember, its still a custodial exchange. Not your private key, not your bitcoin. Its not impossible for the best exchange to get hacked and there is no recourse if that happens. Buy your coins, and if the amount is non trivial, move them to offline/paper or hardware wallet so the private keys are under your own control,
Remember to spread your purchases to reduce your risk. Bitcoin is in full FOMO. There is no telling how high it will go but also not when and how deep it will crash.

Perhaps not zero, but it could certainly fall close enough to zero to be irrelevant to this discussion.
For instance, what do you think would happen if next year the  G20 FATF determines that there are "good" cryptocurrencies (libra, ripple, ..) that can apply AML and KYC, and "bad", unregulated  cryptos  (monero, zcash, bitcoin,.. anything decentralized) that can be used for terrorism funding and recommends exchanges should be cut off from the banking system if they trade in unregulated / bad crypto currencies. Basically all fiat on/off ramps would close,  Certainly all legal ones and even bisq or localbitcoin would become extremely risky.
In so far anyone could still determine the price of bitcoin, it wouldnt be a whole lot.
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:20:55
That doesnt change anything about my argument. Anyone buying bitcoin directly may also have to sell some to pay for taxes and will have to sell them to actually make a profit rather than having a potential profit. Its no different than miners who can chose to either hold their mining in btc or sell it for fiat.
If you read the rest of the thread though, you will discover OP fully understands my point, and is selling his hashrate to customers as cloudmining contracts. Thats why he will not denominate his profit/loss in BTC.  He is selling his customers future mining revenue that will amount to less than 1 BTC  for the fiat value of the price of 1 BTC today. Only people who calculate in dollars and dont think it through will fall for it and actually think they made a good deal if bitcoin goes up in value over that period and future 0.7 BTC is worth more than 1 BTC today. I will gladly offer anyone the same "service". Send me $10800 and I will pay you 0.7 BTC over the next two years. Il even do 0.9 BTC, sure win!
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:20:54
You should be.
Governments probably cant stop bitcoin, but they can close all the fiat on/off ramps. That will kill exchanges and collapse the price (in so far it would still have a price). It would also make it almost impossible for most businesses to accept crypto because they could also not convert it in to fiat. You would lose the overwhelming majority of users and what little adoption there is today. Bitcoin as a protocol could survive, but it will be thrown back 10 years in to the past and with no clear future.

As others have said, it doesnt require a hardfork. And yes, he as a point, but its not worth it IMO. I just installed a new pc, downloaded bitcoin qt and validated the blockchain in less than a day, using a slow mechanical storage drive. Its a bit of a hassle and burden, but its hardly a huge one. 
And no, its not really feasible to do this on mobile devices and mobile data plans yet, but I dont think thats a necessity at this moment yet either. In a future where bitcoin is ubiquitous,  mobile devices may be able to cope with current blocksizes but will probably use LN anyway 
Whatever blocksize you pick, it will always be both too small to allow scaling and too big for perfect decentralization.

Thanks for proving my points over and over again. Miners cant do math.
2 years ago you spent   $1,200,000. Or at that time \~650 BTC
2 years later your valuation "increased" to  $2,518,207. Which today is \~305 BTC
So you spent 650 BTC to earn 305 BTC.
And you think you did well?
I rest my case.
And just in case you are really not getting it; it doesnt matter if you purchased your equipment with fiat or crypto. Your mining generates crypto, your revenue is in crypto, your P/L is inherently tied to it. If crypto had gone down over those 2 years, your dollar profits would have been equally impacted. When you mine, you invest in crypto, directly or indirectly,  and have to measure your P/L in crypto otherwise you are just gambling on a fiat/crypto price increase, and in that case you have to compare it to investing directly in crypto.  Which surprise surprise, is the better bet because mining is pretty much always a crypto denominated loss.
For the record, about 6 or 7 years ago,  people started to pick up on that, and therefore began to offer "cloud mining" contracts. Its a brilliant concept, because you offer a "service" that turns peoples bitcoin in to \~half those bitcoins over a few years. No need to even deploy the equipment and *actually* lose those BTC by mining when you can just pretend to be mining. You could even pay your customers a bit more than actual mining would earn, profits are still guaranteed Maybe you should look in to buying such contracts?  You are likely to lose less on those cloud mining scams,  if you are lucky you might even lose less than 50% of your investement. And if bitcoin price goes up, you could even make a dollar profit. And no hassle and no worries. Pretty good deal compared to what you are doing. I can even do it for you. Send me 100 BTC, Ill send you 50 back over a period of 2 years.  Imagine the ROI that could give you if bitcoin goes to $50K !  And you can pay me in fiat if you want, no worries.
But hey, thanks for sacrificing your precious crypto to keep the network secure. Your efforts are appreciated.

Depends how paranoid you want to be. If you are super paranoid, run a bitcoin node and connect it to your ledger. No GUI yet and not for the faint hearted :
Probably easier, if you are just a regular paranoid; use electrum to interface with the ledger. Electrum is a light client and uses centralized nodes if you dont trust these, use  [  to connect electrum to your own bitcoin node.
In case you dont trust the Ledger; buy a trezor too. Import the same seed in to the trezor.

Nope. If 21M bitcoin represent the entirety of our economy, you could get richer and richer just hodling and laying on the beach on planet earth while others colonize space and grow the economy and thus the value of your btc. If there is going to be a intergalactic crypto currency, its not going to be one with a fixed supply. I mean, thats not even going to work on earth TBH.

The "idiot" was hypothetically if you would have accepted my offer of getting 0.7BTC in the future for $10K today. I assume you wouldnt do that?
And if you invested in august 2018, its not surprising you made a **dollar** profit. Bitcoin was $6500 back then. Its almost $11K today.  Again, calculate how many bitcoin you mined vs how many bitcoin (or fiat) you spent last august. That will eliminate the variability of btc exchange rate and tell you the real story. You are taking the same risks as hodlers. If bitcoin crashes to zero your revenue goes to zero and your equipment will be worth zero.  you are just not getting the same returns as hodlers when bitcoin rallies.

It would increase in value if I accepted it, since 500 coins is now supposedly worth as much as a goat and a house. Its just that I would deem that incredibly unfair and I would refuse that money. Just like the population at large will revolt if our main currency is deflationary. 


But who would be dumb enough to issue an IOU based on a deflationary currency? If I borrow 1 BTC, which today is the price of an old second hand car, I may end up having to repay the equivalent of several houses. Then there is the problem of interest payments, who is going to lend me bitcoin if they can not make a bitcoin profit on it? And since bitcoins would no longer be created, that means anyone with enough bitcoin will be able to accumulate ever more by lending them out at interest. Growing both the amount of bitcoin they have, on top of the increase in value each bitcoin represents. 
People will revolt.

Its pretty much 100% efficient in monetizing excess energy. Im not aware of any other solution that achieves this. Storing energy may be viable in some regions with things like pumping water in high reservoirs. But thats far from 100% efficient and not feasible everywhere. Hydrogen is even worse. Creating hydrogen, compressing it and then later turning it in to energy is \*incredibly\* wasteful (never mind liquefying it).  In some regions there are experiments with storing uncompressed hydrogen in salt mines, which is still inefficient, but not quite as ridiculously so, and not exactly a universal solution either. Nor a very safe one.  Batteries are way too expensive.
The truth however, is that we will need **all** those things, and then some.
\&gt; In a future world where 100% of the energy is clean (with desert solar farms maybe) it would make sense not to store the excess energy but to use it on mining though.
No, it makes sense today(\*). Today we have the problem that renewable energy is by far the cheapest form of energy at the source, but because its so intermittent, as we increase the % of renewable energy on the grid, the costs explode. A solar panel or wind turbine that can use or  sell 100% of its production, is a really cheap way to produce energy. A wind turbine that has be feathered 300 days per year because there is too much solar/wind/hydro production and not enough demand, that is one expensive turbine. In Europe energy prices already go \*negative\* on the grid quite often, in the UK wind turbine operators are paid 100s of millions of tax payer money per year *to feather their turbines* when there is over supply.
With mining, you could run them all  365 days per year.  Most of the time, it would mine and still make some money, the others, it will sell its electricity to the grid and provide extra peak capacity we so desperately need to transition away from fossils. No tax payer money needed.
(\*) asics are still too expensive per watt they consume for this to be practical on a large scale and with  low utilization rates. This will change very quickly.

Yes.  Over a century of research by virtually all climate scientists on the planet, and their work as summarized in IPCC reports. Instead you listen to cherry picked geologists with financial motives and who's arguments are trivially debunked:
 [ 
While nothing is ever 100% settled in science, at this point, I put climate change deniers in the same basket as flat earthers.
However, PoW mining is not a threat to the environment, it will be a significant boon. Once mining hardware stops improving by leaps and bounds so it can be written off over many years, and asic production catches up with demand / difficulty levels off, PoW mining will only be done with free electricity, ie, intermittent oversupply of renewable energy. Which already exists abundantly. Doing so will monetize this excess production and stimulate development of renewable energy production. Its much cheaper and in most places, more efficient than storing renewable energy. PoW mining could be one of the best things happening to the environment in quite some time. Thats why I do not oppose PoW. Otherwise, Id have serious concerns if a different financial system its worth destroying our planet.

Only after you helped expand the economy by adding 100 goats? Thats when the injustice was undone. In our simplified example we have only 2 people who try to balance the books and they can only do that by creating equal amounts of stuff. What if there was a third person with 500 coins who did nothing. How many goats did he gain? Instead of having a net worth of 1 goat, he is now worth 33 goats. Because of my and your work.
The real issue is when money constantly increases in value, people holding money profit from productive work done by others who actually expand the economy that all the money is supposed to represent.  It will lead to less productivity because there is no incentive to trade money for goods.  People will just sit on their money while others do the work. Thats simply the rich getting richer without being productive. 
People. Will. Revolt.

Very simple: dont.
If mining was an easy or sure way to make money by turning on a machine, everyone would do it. And anyone already doing it would do more of it. And then use their profits to do even more. Since overall mining revenue is fixed by the blockreward, its pretty obvious its impossible for everyone to make a profit. In fact, its entirely possible for everyone to make a loss. Which is pretty much what it does for anyone that needs to buy his miners and pay for his electricity.
Here is what mining really does: you pay, say, $10700 (or whatever todays btc price) in hardware and electricity, and you will mine anywhere between 0.5 and 0.8 BTC over the next few years. And morons will claim that is profitable when in 2 years 1 bitcoin is worth $25K.
I can do better for you; send me 10700 today, and I will give you 0.9 BTC spread over two years. Or even immediately if you want. Lets call it accelerated high yield mining.
@_date: 2019-06-10 10:31:35


Well, not "only", but the dominant cost. And that is what electricity cost will become inevitably once the exponential \~10x per year mining efficiency increases we have seen so far stop and hardware depreciation can occur both at a lower level and over many years.  Arguably, this is already the case for miners who produce their own gear on state of the art technology.


Likewise, intermittent mining will become the norm, once mining with 24/7 available energy is no longer profitable. This probably requires hardware depreciation costs to become lower than they are now, certainly for anyone not building his own asics, but that is as mentioned, inevitable. 
Mining hardware used to become obsolete in less than 6 months and cost many times more in purchase than electricity. Thats when you need to run 24/7. If or rather, when,  hardware costs only 5% of what grid electricity usage costs would be over several years, it will make perfect sense to mine just a few hours per day with free or negatively priced energy.  Im not sure this is already the case, I suspect not, difficulty is still too low, therefore profitability too high, and therefore mining hardware too expensive on the open market. I have free electricity, it still doesnt make sense to me to buy mining gear at market prices. But that will change.
So anyway, the conclusions of the report make complete sense to me;  you would currently expect mining to occur where energy is cheap, but still offers 24/7 availability, like hydro power. Once that gets too expensive, you will see the end of mega mines, and instead people just mining with free and otherwise wasted electricity. Its not going to make anyone rich at that point, but it will help fund renewable energy production.

Fixed supply may have been an necessity early on to help people understand how a digital token backed by nothing could have value. But if Im honest, I do not buy in to the austrian economics and if replacing fiat is the goal, I think it is a mistake to have fixed supply, deflationary currency. Even gold has 1-2% inflation and has always had inflation through mining and conquest.
Fortunately, we still have plenty of time to work this out, and if/when this becomes a problem, its not like we cant fix it by forking. This will be resisted by big hodlers of course, but the population at large is not likely to support a system that makes the rich richer without doing anything productive, especially when they can not be taxed. And miners would probably support a permanent block reward, and this may even become necessary to keep the network safe.
Either way, this is decades away.

A hardware wallet is only really needed to safely interact with your wallet, ie, when \*spending\*. As long as you are buying and holding, you can be reasonably safe without one.
You dont even need to run electrum (and you would be safer not running it). Just buy your coins and withdraw them to your address (ie public key). Remember bitcoins are stored on the blockchain, not your computer.
Keep the private key or electrum seed on paper, ideally multiple papers on different physical locations (paper tends to burn if you have house fire) and consider using multiple papers that dont contain the entire key or seed. This may help:
How far you are willing to go there depends on the amount, but realize that anyone who sees your seed or private key will be able to gain full access to your funds so dont print it out and hang it on the wall.  Use at least similar measures as you would to store cash.
@_date: 2019-06-17 06:20:25
Core uses BTC by default. Electrum mBTC. You can change this in either client. mBTC is currently the most sensible unit IMO.  People are not used to tiny fractions, I need a calculator to make sense of numbers like 0.00009 (I just guessed) and i wouldnt even notice one more or one less zero without actually counting them. $9/mBTC is easy to comprehend.
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:01:46
Ask yourself this; would you take a $50K loan to buy more bitcoin? If you say yes, someone needs to spank you. Buying a tesla on credit to keep your btc is basically the same thing. You should not buy the car on credit without selling your btc, unless you can afford it even if btc goes to zero. If you cant, you should cash out whatever it is you need to be able to afford the car regardless of future btc prices.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:20:54
Sure, but there are plenty of applications where its  worth to sacrifice some of bitcoins security in order to gain functionality or scalability.  Money is not one of them, but countless smart contract /tokenization applications come to mind, think most ethereum tokens, where the counterparty risk is inherently greater than the risk of the blockchain being corrupted.
I do actually expect over time for these things to become either sidechains or layers on top of bitcoin. Much like LN.

Another miner who doesnt understand mining. Your machines mine bitcoin, not dollars. And while you may sell those for dollar, and you may only care about dollars, the point is that your results will depend primarily on bitcoin price. You only stand a chance of making a dollar profit if bitcoin price goes up and goes up faster than difficulty. Since thats what you are betting on, the correct way to measure your results is comparing your mining revenue to buying bitcoin at the time you bought the miners. Or, comparing how many bitcoins you mined vs you spent.
Im pretty sure you wont get it, so lets put it this way: lets say I let you rent my non existing miner; you send me $10K today and I guarantee I will pay you 0.7 BTC "mining revenue" over the next two years. You may instantly convert those in to cash or hold on to them thats your choice.  If bitcoin is at 25K after those 2 years,  you would think you made a good deal. You made a dollar profit!.

Even when I explain it like I would to a 5 year old, you still dont understand it?  You supposedly run a multi million dollar mining operation, but it hasnt yet occurred to you that hardware depreciation and energy costs are your two only relevant costs, and how they relate to each other is pretty darn fucking important to your business model? Hashrate is what is irrelevant in the big picture, everyone has access to the same machines as you, so over time hashrate increases are absorbed by difficulty.  I actually begin to believe you do not understand how mining works.  Especially when you say things like:


Ive met some dumb miners in my time, but you win the crown.
Here is a clue for you: bitcoin mining generates 12.5 BTC per 10 minutes, plus some tx fees. It doesnt matter if bitcoin is worth $1 or $1M. It doesnt matter if Im the only one mining on my 10 year old PC at 1 KH/s, or if everyone on the planet invests their life savings in solar panels and mining ASICs. So no, mining will never stop.  And overall the entire industry will spend ~12.5 BTC per 10 minutes. 
So who will make a profit ? Its entire possible no miner does if everyone is a moron that overspends and mines at a loss. Realistically however, those who have an edge over the rest of the miners, those who have access to lower costs or can add value in other ways. Like by producing ASICs. Or providing cheap or even free surplus energy. 
You? What do you add exactly? Just like everyone in the world can, you buy your machines from people who sell them at (very fat) profit margins. From miners who will then out-compete you by mining themselves on machines you paid for, and in the process, shatter your difficulty and thus revenue projections by exploding difficulty. 
Similarly, just like millions of people can, you buy your electricity from a provider who sells it to you for a profit margin. Do you have cheaper energy than everyone else? Not a chance. Your provider has access to cheaper electricity than you. His producer has cheaper energy and may even have a significant amount of unsold and unsellable capacity. Chinese miners can get 24/7 electricity for as little as $0.01 per kWh. Renewable energy providers have 100s of millions of dollar worth of free electricity they could and eventually will use. 
But you expect to be more cost effective than miners that are mining with "free" hardware that you paid for, and virtually or effectively free energy? If *you* could profit, then *everyone* could. Everyone could be rich! Its not possible, mining is a ZERO FUCKING SUM GAME. And you are not holding any cards, you are getting played.

It wont be just facebook. It will be a conglomerate of companies that combined will have that power, and they will just act as a proxy for the government, who's rules they need to follow. 
The same rules will apply to companies that issue tokens or contracts on the unstoppable distributed ethereum computer. Think ICOs.  It will apply to fiat on/off ramps like exchanges who will also freeze accounts when told by the governement. It will apply to third parties for instance a company holding the gold that your token supposedly represents.
The only time there is a fundamental difference is if the smart contract doesnt depend on  parties or liabilities outside of the ethereum blockchain. So no centralized exchanges, no identifiable companies or persons that issue tokens or contracts, no counterparty risk.  Ive often asked examples of such contracts, no one has so far come up with a really compelling answer. Dai and casinos. But Dai is "just money"  and its only a contract to allow it be a stable coin, not unlike libra itself. That leaves.. casinos as the killer app?

This is a really poor argument, that can be used to justify any kind of energy waste. And it becomes a lot worse argument if you believe bitcoin will one day compete directly with fiat and could be worth 100x more, at which point it would consume at least 100x as much.
Fortunately, there are \*much\* better arguments to show PoW mining will actually generate renewable energy:

Sounds like a flat earther to me. *Im not saying the earth is flat because its in the bible, I say so because I  can see it with my own eyes, I am "capable of individual reasoning "*. Tell me, how many satellites do you have taking measurements? How many ice cores have you analysed, how many climate models that accurately forecast the past 100 years have you run on your supercomputer?
Climate modelling is very frigging hard, there are countless effects and interactions. But if you want to dumb it down to the level of a flat earther, the basics behind anthropological climate change is very straight forward. You had a system that was in balance, and now we are adding 10GT of carbon per year to the atmosphere that we are not removing. We can measure this pretty easily and accurately, concentrations are higher (in fact, more than double) than they have been in over 1 million years. We also know what higher concentrations of Co2 results in, both "because physics" and because we have plenty of historical references. Scientists have known this since the 1960s.

That said, i fully understand the anxiety. I  bricked my own 1 year long untouched Nano last week with a firmware upgrade. Still waiting for Ledger to come up with a solution or replacement. 
Fortunately I have a second nano that still works (at least for bitcoin, most alts do not work anymore, and require an update which I refuse to do until my first nano works again). The irony is that I bought 2 nanos specifically to save myself from the stress if something happened to the first, and to easily test my seed and upgrade firmwares without worrying.

First of; so what? Bitcoin wont succeed or fail because the price is higher or lower.
Secondly, there is another reason: bitcoin is barely used for trade atm, the price is set almost exclusively by people who are trading it for fiat profits. But no one knows what bitcoin is worth. You dont, I dont, no one does.  We have no reference frame, no good methodology, no history.
You can make a good case why it could be virtually worthless, you could argue reasonably it should be worth as much as gold. So there is no way to judge the current price. is $10K insanely overpriced or a bargain? Yes. Div/0. The result it that it simply goes up because its going up, and goes down, because its going down. It doesnt require whales or manipulation. People are buying now because its rallying and there is no reasonable ceiling. Once it begins crashing  people will panic sell and it will continue going down because there is no reasonable floor.

I bricked 2 Nano's too, stuck on "bootloader". After a dozen emails back and forth telling me try every version of ledger live in recent history, I tried on an old laptop which had never seen a ledger, and presto, firmware update succeeded on both.
Fun fact: I bought 2 because I wanted to be sure any issue with one, would not lock me out. When I bricked the first one, the second one was way out of date and only the bitcoin app still worked. So I bought a THIRD one, this time a nano X before I dared try update the second nano S (which I also bricked). 
If all of that is not bad enough, I bought the X also for bluetooth. Turns out its not supported on PC. So yeah, my recommendation for ledger is also not very enthusiastic.

Well, in fairness, it already has a lot of functionality that bitcoin doesnt, and IF they manage to execute on their roadmap, they may add PoS mining and sharding to that. The former may or may not be a good idea, Im still on the fence about that, but its certainly good for PR (no more "wasteful" mining). But sharding would be awesome for sure. If they can pull it off. Which Im not yet convinced off. And if they cant pull it off, that exploding blockchain is going to become a real problem. Whichever way you look at it, its exciting :)

My BTC node with 1MB block uses 140GB in storage &gt;500GB per month in bandwidth. With 8x larger blocks, thats no longer feasible, even with my "unlimited" cable connection. Worse is that BCH doesnt support segwit, so no second or third layer scaling.So after 8MB blocks fill up, it will have to move to 16, 32 ...up to 100s of MB to ever achieve its goals. Good luck running your own node then.

However few you may own, its still more than probably 99% of the population. So if bitcoin succeeds, you will still be a 1 percenter.
And while I dont think there will be another opportunity anytime soon like the one we **have seen** with bitcoin so far, Im far less convinced today is remotely similar. The exponential growth in value over the past 10 years  simply came from exponential growth in number of users and number of people that knew about it.  To go from 5 people to a billion you need to double every 6 month. But that has flattened. "Most" people know about it now, polls put it around 90% in the US and EU.  Whether or not they will now put their money in to it, or how much, that still remains to be seen.  It also remains to be seen how governments will react if bitcoin truly becomes a significant factor. So from $1 to $10K was "easy". From here to $10M, thats an entirely different story.

If someone hacks an exchange, he will just steal the btc, assuming he gains access to it. So there is nothing left to buy with the fiat balances.

Your btc balance, not so much.

If you are afraid of that then either:
\- You invested more than you should have
\- You invested solely for short term fiat profits and not because you think bitcoin will eventually succeed.
If you invested a sensible amount or you understand what this is about, then there is no reason to fear a crash to 4000. It is going to crash again and again. It could certainly crash below 4000 again, even without an obvious trigger and I could think of a dozen triggers. You could either see it as an opportunity to buy more, or not care a damn because its meaningless in the long run.
To me its almost a binary thing; the odds that  in 10 years bitcoin remains similar in usability, capability, adoption and price range seems pretty small. Much more likely, it will either succeed or fail. It may take another 10 years or even more before we find out, but if it succeeds, current price fluctuations will look completely meaningless. If it fails, and it certainly can, then so be it, then I guessed wrong. How will we know if it succeeded? One way to judge that is once we stop pricing bitcoin in fiat but instead use bitcoin to price other things, including fiat. Given that, who cares about how much a dollar is worth today or tomorrow? You should perhaps instead look at what percentage of all btc you own.

nonsense.Gold, like bitcoin or fiat or any form of money is just an accounting system that represents wealth in the real economy. If gold goes to zero tomorrow, no wealth will be destroyed. It will just be reallocated from those that have gold to those that have anything else.
Besides, that article is more than a little misleading. While mining in space will eventually make gold pointless as a store of wealth, we are no where close yet. In this particular asteroid,most of the metal and the potential value is not gold , but  nickel and iron. Thats actually the real honeypot when you consider the  value of having metals or anything really, in orbit.

Good money should have no intrinsic value. Its should be scarce (and durable,  fungible,  divisible and etc). Gold has been pretty good at those things, and if anything, its moderate usefulness for jewelry or industry is a handicap, not a benefit. Although I would make that same point against bitcoin, which is useful to pay for tx fees.
One of the main problems I have with gold, aside from practicality, is the fact its not scarce. At all. Its abundant. Its only scarce in the upper layers of the crust of our planet. That made it good enough for the past 4000 years, but probably not even for the next 40 when you realize a single asteroid can contain as much gold as we have ever mined. How long before we can capture asteroids and send them crashing in to a shallow ocean? Its not gonna happen in 4 years I think but its definitely not going to take 400 years either.

When it comes to "money", I do agree on the importance of censorship resistance and trustlessness, which is why I dont see a threat to bitcoin or monero etc. Censorship resistant money will either become a thing or it wont, but libra isnt going to change that.
when it comes to smart contracts, Im not  yet convinced. Not when almost all current smart contracts and tokens have external liabilities where fraud can happen and censorship can be applied.  After all those years, Im still  waiting to see what the killer app is of an unstoppable cloud computer that can resist even government influence.  The best so far seems to casino's and decentralised exchanges, but those are hardly impressive world changing use cases.
An immutable computer is a really cool concept, but almost all smart contracts I have seen, might as well run on a permissioned chain like libra and benefit from its simpler scaling, 2 billion users, built-in compliance etc.
Finally, should someone come up with a killer (d)app where ultimate censorship resistance is of the utmost importance, then you have to wonder if it shouldnt run as a sidechain of, or a layer on top of bitcoin, particularly after ethereum switches to PoS.

I did find a solid project \~8 years ago. Ever since Ive only seen only weak imitations or shit (\*) projects.
(\*)  At least in so far they try to compete with fiat. There are  other interesting crypto projects besides bitcoin that may  not be fully decentralized  but they also dont pretend to be money. Not everything requires perfect censorship resistance. But an alternative to fiat money does, or its pointless.

LOL. Its not cheating. When you only have 2 people you cant see the effects if you  make both of them participate equally in growing the economy. Then of course its reasonable they both hold half the coins and that each half represents half the economy regardless if you inflate or deflate the amount of coins. It makes no difference then. I created an inbalance by having one person build a house, you then fixed that by making the other produce 100 goats. Thats why I added a third.


Remember, I set the price of the house in *goats*, things of actual value. I agreed to 100 goats, the amount of coins in circulation is irrelevant at that point. I also gave the fourth person a goat so that the value of goats expressed in the currency remained constant. So that third person changes nothing, it only demonstrates my point and you dont seem to like that. 


He inherited it from his dad?  Does it matter?


Wait, what exactly are you adding here? People with coins who dont produce anything? You are thus *increasing* the overall money supply while keeping the economy at the same size; obviously reducing the very effect I was demonstrating. You might as well keep adding more people with no money that actually produce houses and goats, and then the lazy bum who inherited 500 coins will end up being worth hundreds of houses.
But regardless how big it is, can you at least admit now that if inflation is a tax on people with money that benefits people without money, that deflation is a tax on productivity and benefits people with money? And if so, how is that a good idea? What would actually stop a large fortune from growing indefinitely and across generations, other than the economy stopping to grow? (which btw, is exactly what too high concentration of wealth result in)


Are you in favor of 100% taxation on estates? If not,  then whatever you may have earned by actively producing during life,  will be passed on to future generations and its actual value would keep increasing without your offspring lifting a finger. You create a class of kings. And that automatically leads to a much larger class of people who have nothing, since money is not the thing of value, it just represents your fraction of the actual things of value.  You cant have kings without a lot of poor people.
Obviously people should be able toi enjoy the fruits of their labor, which they can if the value of money remains roughly stable, and even if it decreases a little over time; but you want those fruits to produce more fruits who produce more fruits all of which has to come from *other* people's labor. Because that is only fair? I think its much more fair to put an expiration date on your fruits, enjoy them or go make some new ones. 
BTW, if money generates real world wealth (that others must produce), then its no longer a valueless representation of wealth, which we both agreed it should be. It is in fact,  the ultimate valueable thing to have now, a "wealth printing press".


On the level of an individual, yes, that is the most fair system. You get  the money you earned and its purchasing power remains stable forever. You can then even pass it on to future generations, but a fortune wont grow itself until infinity and since people do need to spend, it will eventually vanish unless your offspring becomes productive.
But for reasons I explained before, I am convinced that society as a whole benefits greatly from modest inflation, and that its certainly preferable over modest deflation, but lets agree to disagree on that for now, and contrast your ideal of price stability with bitcoin; its not just deflationary, its supply is utterly fixed at 21M.  By your own admission, thats a theoretically ideal currency for an economy that completely stands still (which is what it would result in, BOMB style).  Its a terrible currency for a thriving economy or growing society. We have never been stupid enough to try anything like it. Even gold inflates by 1-2% per year right now due to mining,  and it inflated a whole lot more when gold was our main currency and we did things like plunder South America. People think plundering that gold made us rich, but gold has very little intrinsic value, it was our money, all we really did by plundering was expand the money supply.
I understand why satoshi did this; its difficult enough to understand digital scarcity, and if you cant easily demonstrate having a fixed supply, precious few people would understand how a a digital coin based on nothin could have any value. But a fixed supply is still the single dumbest thing he did and if nothing else stops bitcoin, then that most certainly will .

\&gt; Eventually all miners cost more to run than they're worth.
I would argue they almost always cost more than they earn (in btc). But I understand your point; you are saying mining revenue declines with increasing difficulty and at some point they may not even mine enough to pay for electricity.
Things is, you should NOT factor in future replacement costs when calculating profitability of any given miner. You need calculate how much the miner costs (purchase - perhaps some resale value + electricity ) and how much it earns (BTC mined over its lifetime). If that is positive - which it wont be when you calculate in bitcoin- you should just expand whenever you can afford to, to the extend you can within you location, as each extra miner would increase your overall profits.
Subtracting the cost of future miners that will pay themselves back (if you do the math wrong like all miners do) from the profit of current ones makes no sense.

If you dont know who Ver is, I find it extremely unlikely you'd have the knowledge and experience to determine what is and what isnt a workable and secure solution to the scaling problem, and that you would know better than the 100s of data professionals working on core.. 
But, assuming you're sincere (which I doubt), here is a hint: a (trustless, P2P) blockchain that saves all transactions and propagates them to all nodes to verify them, can never scale infinitely and will never scale anywhere close to Paypal/visa/banking levels, or be used as a world wide currency. Simple math says it cant.  Bitcoin is barely a few years old, hardly used by anyone in the grand scheme of things, and already its blockchain size has grown so large and become so hard to process, that we've gone from 250K full nodes a few years ago, to less than 10K today.  Less nodes == less decentralisaton and less security. Exploding the blockchain size by letting it grow 8x faster is a horrible idea. If you want bitcoin to become a real "currency", you need a fundamentally different solution for this, with off-chain, payment channels (Segwitt/lightning network/side chains) that settle on the blockchain. 
More over, larger blocks doesnt solve anything. As long as blocks are far from full, and storage in those blocks is essentially free, people will (ab)use it for spam, messaging, storing warez data, satoshidice, whatever until they are full, or at least the permanent and ultra secure storage in the blockchain carries a reasonable market price. There is no way around this. Larger blocks just means more abuse, but the price for actual transactions will ultimately reach the same levels. In the mid term, the only thing larger blocks will achieve is that the blockchain will grow so big, that only a handful of entities will bother or be able to run a full node. A highly centralized, far less secure bitcoin. Is that what you want?  And in the short term, you will disincentivize the development and adoption of actual working, off chain scaling solutions. If it weren't for the 1MB limit, we wouldnt have had segwitt and LN today. We would just run full steam ahead in to a brick wall.

I used to pay for pizza's with bitcoin. Literally, as an alternative to paypal, because it was cheaper. And everyone was touting it as this frictionless and cheap way to transfer money online. I did too. The reality is that today, thats not feasible anymore.


The layers you build on top of bitcoin, will no longer be bitcoin, and will not be as secure or as censorship resistant. That doesnt make it a bad idea, at all, as paying for pizza's simply doesnt  require the same level of security, but its no longer "bitcoin".  I dont think we'll ever buy pizza's with bitcoin again. Maybe with IOU's based on bitcoin, but not with bitcoins.

Last chart on that page. You may want to read the rest too, its pretty revealing. For instance the number of users that stopped using crypto is almost identical to the number that is still using it. Not a good sign.
Anyway, Ive linked 3 different studies now, from 3 different sources, all of which paint a very similar picture.  **People have heard of bitcoin.**  And yes  13K is actually quite a lot for a poll. Most polls only sample \~1000 people to get statistically relevant results. 13K random samples on a population of 8 billion would give you a margin of error of just 1%
Now they "only" sampled 22 countries, those wouldnt even have 8 billion people, so for those countries, the margin would be below 1%. Im sure in certain other (poor, underdeveloped) countries the % of people that have heard of bitcoin will be lower than in the US or UK or the 22 countries they picked, but so will their literacy, internet availability and available income, so for this discussion, they are not very relevant. Its not the people in Yemen or Haiti that will pump bitcoin to 10x its current cap.
Anyway, I dont care if its 10% or 20% or 30% of the relevant population that hasnt heard of bitcoin yet. If you want to pretend most of those people have not heard of bitcoin yet, then you are simply in denial.

I heard it all now. You pay 100% tax on your income? I didnt think so either. So no, being able to write off  investments does not make it free at all. It just lowers your taxable income and thus lowers the cost by whatever tax rate you pay, assuming you would not plug it in so it doesnt generate any taxable income.  Better talk to your accountant again.
Before stopping this utterly unproductive discussion, please do indulge me here, and give me your best estimate for bitcoin difficulty or its growth over the next 6, 12 and 24 months. Im *really* curious what numbers you use for your financial projections. 
Ill give you mine: roughly 6-7% average difficulty increase until the next halving.  Possibly a little less in the coming months, a lot more by the end of the year when 7nm production ramps up. If you work out the math, I will not earn back the btc an antminer S17 costs today before the halving, even when its actually delivered by the end of august and even without having electricity costs.

It could succeed; but its not going to succeed without the opposition putting up *one hell of a fight*.

From where I sit, it certainly seems no worse than  Saudi Arabia. If Iranians want to change their regime, I will certainly support them, but  Foreign countries waging economic warfare (and thats exactly what it is), I will never support. It always hurts the population, not the regime.


You dont seriously believe that? Are you going to tell me Iran is fucking Lybia up as well?


Why should we? Am I right saying you dont know the first thing about bitcoin? The whole point of it is that its completely neutral and ungoverned. It doesnt matter who mines or sends or who receives. Bitcoin just follows its own mathematical rules and eliminates all centralised points of control. That means it removes governments ability to control it. If anything, you should be supportive of that idea; take power away from oppressive governments and put in the hands of ordinary citizens who will be free to own, earn and spend with no political strings attached.

When oil prices change by just 3% that causes panic. How do you think governments would  cope with bitcoins volatility?
More over, what are governments going to do with that BTC? You can use dollars to buy anything, but what is Iran going to pay for with BTC? Its not like Airbus or Siemens or wheat traders will accept it. And its not like they can sell it on an exchange.
There are probably also many more subtle problems; for instance,  bitcoin being irreversible, makes it far from trivial for a government to handle it. Who has the private keys? How do you prevent those people from running off with billions in BTC? How do they store it, what if they die, .. ? It may be possible to come up with solutions, but its not straight forward.
In the long run, trading oil for btc could perhaps become viable, but thats a very very long way off.  Mid term may be some permissioned blockchain solution, i remember reading Iran was actually looking in to that, but there again you need counterparties so you can actually use your tokens and those counterparties can not interface with dollar markets or they would be breaking sanctions. Fact remains, right now if you are under sanctions by the US government, its pretty darn tough to do any trade with anyone. US policies are undermining its dollar hegemony but it hasnt lost it yet.

Why do people always assume exponential growth continues indefinitely? One of the reasons early growth was exponential is because the number of people that knew about bitcoin grew exponentially. But we are near saturation there , most people have heard about it by now(\*).  Plot that on your chart and see what happens.
Now you could argue that the number of people who *understand* bitcoin is still small, and certainly the number of people who actually own it is small, but you would have to give me a reason why that would change. Why would someone who didnt care to learn about btc last year or the year before, or for whatever reason decided not to invest, why would he change his mind?
(\*) edit: for those who think most people havent heard of bitcoin yet, sorry to burst your bubble, but they have:

Keeping bitcoins in your own wallet doesnt necessarily means they are more secure. It just means you control them. But that also implies you are responsible for their security. So if you dont make backups or if you let your PC be infiltrated by malware or hackers, they are still gone. If the amount is small enough that a hardware wallet doesnt make sense, I would actually consider keeping them on an exchange unless your PC savvy enough to know your PC is safe or you are ok keeping them offline in a paper wallet for "hodling". If the amount is more significant, a hardware wallet is a no brainer.
As for fees and being forced to use exchanges; there is a much better way: **earn** some btc. Sell stuff, provide services do something to earn bitcoin.

Its great that BCH current dev isnt that dumb and thinks at some point maybe somehow it "will happen", but its not going to happen without Ver and Wu approving, and its not a credible scaling roadmap.  meanwhile, they activated a block size timebomb, not entirely unlike Ethereums difficulty timebomb. Its a stupid short sighted approach.
Also note he says its not going to be BCH that develops these solutions; so who will? Without segwit support, there is no known mechanism for it, nor is there demand for it, seeing blocks are barely 1% full and everyone working on scaling tech is targeting Segwit which is now supported by a ton of blockchains.

No one can force you to use sidechains or payment channels. You'll always have the choice to spend your coins directly on the blockchain for transactions where it makes sense.

That doesnt change my point.  It could go back to $1000 or even $100 if various supranational crypto taskforces decide to outlaw unregulated crypto currencies and cut bitcoin exchanges from the banking system.
The point is, your risk and reward is extremely closely tied to bitcoin price. Just like that of anyone investing in it directly. The major difference is that you are virtually guaranteed to earn less (or lose more).  Asic mining is just overpaying for your btc


LOL. Just to be clear, I  mined bitcoin probably 6 or 7 years before you heard of it. And Im not saying investing in bitcoin is a bad idea. Im saying investing in asic mining is (much) worse than investing in bitcoin. I can explain you why that is, as I have predicted this ever since the first bitcoin asic was announced and retired as a miner. I have been completely vindicated in my predictions and even in my prediction people would keep making the same mistake you are making now.
For now Im trying just to *demonstrate* it to you using your own numbers. If I cant get you to look at the correct numbers, Im not going to bother to explain the market mechanisms that virtually guarantee your btc denominated loss. Those mechanisms,  I am quite certain, you do not understand half as good as I do.


So you are holding the bitcoins you mine? That makes it even more silly to calculate your profits in fiat.  You can either buy bitcoin or you can mine them. Im pretty sure you are paying at least 25% more for your mined bitcoin vs buying them at market prices.

Its like selling without having to touch/move your bitcoins. Ive done it occasionally,  when bitcoin went ballistic, I would go short on  Kraken, but just a small amount, far less than i have bitcoins in cold storage. Its just less hassle than move my bitcoin from cold storage, transfer, sell, only to later buy back and move back to cold storage. If I lost the bet, I could still close my short position and then move the btc and actually sell them
instead of hedging, think of it as profit taking.

Ok,  I just  saw you are renting out your miners. So maybe you do actually understand the game  and you are just trying to sucker people in to accepting mining contracts like the hypothetical one I offered you: pay  dollars now, get btc in the future but less BTC than those dollars would buy today.
Let me give you a pro tip: it works even better without miners. Its called cloudmining scams.
When asics first appeared some people understood the math and game theory and rather then investing and mining for themselves, they starting selling cloud mining contracts. Let others put up the cash and eat the crypto denominated losses and just collect fees.  Their customers didnt even care, they calculated in dollars and thought they made profits.
Then cloud miners got smarter and figured, why **actually** lose those bitcoins and go through the trouble of mining when I can just pretend? Just offer cloud mining contracts, collect the dollars,  buy BTC with them,  pretend to mine, and slowly pay out a fraction of the BTC you bought. Just 50% would usually be enough to keep customers happy, they where counting dollars after all, and since bitcoin on average doubled every 6 months, they where happy.  Just like you are pretending to be happy. Or maybe actually are, its hard to tell.

Thats not how fiat works. Money isnt minted. Money is created based on debt. Lets go back to my example; what would i sell my house for? You dont have anything I want in return, but  I would sell you my house for a IOU that states you owe me 100 goats. Or if you like, an IOU for 100x500 coins since a goat was worth 500. That IOU becomes new money.  Thats how money gets created, its just IOUs. And that is completely fair.

Your fiat balance is fdic insured. Your BTC are not. Coinbase say their crypto hot wallet is also insured separately, but that is 2% of their entire crypto holdings and it would not be impossible for a hacker to slowly drain the exchange.
If your pc gets hacked, your coinbase balance is at risk; even if you have proper 2FA, someone could trick you into withdrawing to their own accounts. this is not easy, but not impossible either. If that happens, its neither insured nor recoverable.
With a hardware wallet, even if your pc is infected, it shouldnt matter provided you actually verify the addresses and amounts on the hardware wallet display. Funds also dont pass "via" your pc, you withdraw directly to an address controlled by the hardware wallets private keys.
Lastly, you should plan for the "if something happens to me" regardless. You can also do that with a hardware wallet. Put your seed in a safety deposit box, put it in your will, use shamir secret sharing to to create a number of shares and distribute those shares among loved/trusted people. You can chose how many of those shares are required to reconstruct the seed, so you could, say, shred the seed in 6 and configure it so 4 are required.

If the amount of btc on the drive justifies it, a data recovery center would be your only option. I understand your fear they might steal your coins, but not stealing customers data would be pretty important to any serious data recovery operation.

Sunk cost fallacy. That money was gone the moment you sold your btc.

Yeah because money printing would cause inflation and the rich have no money ? That makes complete sense.
Money printing isnt the issue BTW. Inflation still is low, and I dont subscribe to the view that controlled inflation is bad. If money was printed and put to good, productive use, it wouldnt be problem.

Opening and closing channels still has to happen on chain.  And if there is free space on chain, doing high value transactions would still be preferable to do on the blockchain and not on LN, so I dont think we would ever see empty blocks.
Even so, the reality is that we dont know how this will play out. Users can set their own fees, but miners are free to take or ignore low fee tx; the assumption is a free market will find an equilibrium, somehow.

I said I have a handful of KW of free electricity. I never said I had access to negatively priced energy. Consumers dont get that yet, and may never get that, those negative prices apply on the grid level to producers and distributors, possibly large industrial consumers. Energy may be negatively priced for them at times, but it still needs to be distributed before I get it, and distribution costs are about as high as energy costs here.
But even if I had negatively priced energy; why would I spend $1500 on a 1000W miner, when I can just use a $10 2500W space heater?   Same goes for my actual situation, obviously I use my free electricity to heat in winter and for airco in summer. I could use some miners rather than oil heaters, and put them elsewhere in summer, but that only makes sense if I have decent chance of mining more than these machines cost. And there is only a vanishingly small chance of that happening with current asic $/W prices. That will change though, and that is one of many things you dont understand and you dont understand the implications off. When miners get cheap enough per watt to use intermittently and will literally begin being used as space heaters, water heaters and dump loads, particularly by renewable energy producers.


Oh man. You cant predict future bitcoin price, which is of course is true. But you also cant predict future difficulty or even guesstimate a mid term trend either?  How the fuck do you plan your business, when you have no idea what you will earn? you just assume its going to make profit, despite having far higher energy and equipment costs than others, because "blockchain"? If you could, then everyone could and everyone would but that is impossible since the overall mining revenue is fixed.
If you understood the big picture I tried to paint to you, you would understand that even with large uncertainties in the above metrics, the reality is the opposite of always making profits;   in a mining world with rational actors trying to maximize their profits, you, as a price taker for btc, price taker for asics and price taker for energy, you will not make a crypto denominated profit.

What market demand do you think BCH addresses? Low cost/fast online payments can be done better by traditional solutions, or even alt coins like Ripple. Bitcoin doesnt currently address that market, it addresses the demand for a secure, censorship resistant distributed ledger, and has been wildly successful in that. 
BCH adopts the same name, but will gladly sacrifice Bitcoins single most important attribute and morph into yet another centralized permissioned solution like Ripple or Paypal, only MUCH less efficient, MUCH slower and in all likelyhood, much more expensive. 
The only real "market demand" it meets, is a coin with an exploitable PoW algorithm for Bitmain, so they can make money off their patented mining hack (let me guess, you dont know what Im talking about?). And the only reason BCH is valued at its current price, is that people havent caught on to this, manipulation, deception and the fact many people dont yet understand the compromises its making and the impact of those.  It can only hide those for so long though.

Big blocks means lots of unused space, which means low TX fees (for a while). The only way for BCH miners to fetch TX rewards similar to BTC today, is by the blocks to fill up entirely so a similar price competition starts between users to get their tx included. At that point, BCH will be just like BTC today, so what exactly did it accomplish? You only made it harder/more expensive to run a node,  less decentralised, and you made it incompatible with every currently proposed scaling solution. How is that better?

And yet, thats what they will do, or at least what the net effect will be: more solar and wind production.  
But the producers (miners or otherwise) will sell their solar and wind energy to the grid when demand from the grid is high enough, and thus prices high enough. They will only mine when there is surplus capacity and they can use that to mine and monetize their excess capacity, that rather than what they  currently do by giving it away or even paying customers to use energy.

First of all, multiply your storage cost with the number of users. If one day, 100 million users use bitcoin, your 1TB blockchain now costs $50B  in storage hardware alone, and possibly a high multiple of that in bandwidth costs (my node is connected to 100 users, and even my "unlimited" internet will be throttled long before I get anywhere close to a TB).
Secondly; the medium cost is trivial compared to its market value.  Permanently storing data in a public,  immutable blockchain has countless applications, far more than simply transmitting money. Especially if that storage is virtually free, it will be used and abused for anything from spam, to secure messaging to storing contracts, source code, identities, timestamps, medical data, heck, kiddie porn. Even if you only look at online payments,  its clear that no current decentralised blockchain can ever store and process a significant percentage of only those. You'd need gigabyte blocks to get close to paypal and visa. Thats what the author means by "unbounded". So it doesnt really matter how big you make the blocks, it will never be remotely big enough. But it can easily become (way) too big to be workable by end users with normal PCs and typical internet connections.
So if, like BCH, you dont allow for sidechain solutions (no segwit!), dont allow different methods for low value transactions or transactions between trusting users (LN and the like), then whatever blocksize limit you chose, it will be too small, and TX fees will ultimately still have to cap the number of transactions. And then despite gigantic blocks, your pizza payment will still not be able to compete with higher value transactions. So you sacrificed decentralisation, created a gigantic bloated blockchain, removed any chance of actually getting to a working scaling solution, so you  solved exactly nothing. But hey, you'll have a 1TB SSD that Im sure you can use for something else ;).

The reward is being able to verify your own transactions without needing to trust any third party. You are free to discard that 'reward', and instead put your trust in a third party saying you received X BTC. But then I have to wonder why you're using bitcoin in the first place? And doing so doesnt really put anyone else at risk, it mostly puts yourself at the mercy of your third party.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:52:19
First of all, diskspace used &gt;&gt; block size. You need to store indexes and what have you. Actual diskspace is significantly more than the theoretical blocksize. You're probably looking at closer to 1TB per year, which is already a problem. Also note that internet bandwidth usage is a high multiple of that, as you dont want to be connected to a single peer, or you are inserting trust again.
But my main beef with BCH is not 8MB blocks. If that where a one time block size increase, its probably survivable and I wouldnt oppose it too vehemently. The problem is that BCH wants to scale ONLY on chain. No segwit. No lightning network. No sidechains. That means that if BCH becomes successful, 8MB will be just as inadequate as 1MB, because to store a meaningful % of all online payment transactions alone (let alone all other usecases), you'd need blocks that are gigabytes in size. 
So at least one these must be true:
- either BCH will fail to obtain a meaningful % of online transactions or other application for storing data in a immutable decentralised ledger.
- AND/OR its 8MB blocks will get full and it will have the exact same problems as bitcoin today, only without hope of actually solving it (no segwit) and no hope of ever scaling back the blocksize.
- AND/OR blocks will become so big, only third party dedicated servers can process them, and you no longer have a trustless network.
The approach core chose is much more sane. In its current form, bitcoin can not obtain a meaningful % of online transactions, because the technology to do so in a decentralised ledger simply doesnt exist. Penetration is held back by free market fees, that still allow high value transactions to be processed but makes low value transaction economically unfeasible, keeping with technological reality.  But the high fees of the main chain create an incentive to develop offchain/sidechain/LN or other scaling technologies, and if or when those arrive, demand and thus TX fees on the main chain will drop and penetration rate can go up without having caused irreversible damage to its core principles of being trustless and permissionless. The one thing that sets (some) crypto apart from Paypal or visa.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:21:42
I admit my analogy is not great, but yours is just laughable. 
And whats does 8x "further" mean? 8x larger blocks does allow you to do ~8x more transactions, but thats still only a trivial % of the overall transaction market (and lets not mention other use cases). So if that blockchain becomes successful, and fees remain low, that 8x may translate in to less than a year.  Then what? 
Meanwhile, low TX fees and Bitcoin Jesus'  promise of keeping blocks large enough so they dont fill up, completely removes any incentive to work on alternatives. And by not supporting segwitt or any form of offchain offloading, there is not even a  proposed practical way to solve the problem.  8MB will become 16MB, which will become 32MB and before you know it, you reinvented Paypal, just using an orders of magnitude less efficient architecture.
Mind you, there is nothing magical about a 1MB block limit.  It could be higher, it could even have been  lower as far as Im concerned. But you do need a firm limit to mobilize market forces to provide a workable scaling solution, and thinking you can just solve scaling through large blocks is asinine.

Both. As always. I will never sell everything, no matter how fast or high it goes, but I will sell some on parabolic rises and buy some back some during crashes. Been doing that for a looong time, and though that sounds like a sure winner, obviously it isnt because you never know how high the peaks will be and how low the crashes, but my goal is not to trade perfectly,  just to lock in some profits and reduce my risk. Of course, on hindsight I always wish I sold more at the peak and bought more at the bottom, BTC  denominated my stash may well have decreased, but its good to have some certain profits no matter what, and not missing the boat no matter what.

Its "cheaper and faster" because virtually no one uses it. 99% of alt coins are even cheaper and/or faster. Often dramatically. If BCH would ever become as trusted, popular and widespread as bitcoin, it would quickly become just as slow and or expensive. But on top of that, it will not be able to implement scaling solutions like Lightning network (Jihan Wu doesnt want segwit, it breaks his PoW exploit), so it would lug along a massive and ever increasing blockchain, and as a result will stop being a trustless, decentralized ledger.  That is, if it doesnt stop working at all. Instead you'll need to trust third party validators so it would be more akin to a slow, horrendously inefficient Paypal. 
If you need fast or cheap, paypal and Visa have you covered. If you want decentralised, trustless and permissionless transactions, then until segwit based layered scaling solutions come online, there is a market price to pay.

Not just their own coins, also the coins of anyone conspiring with them. Or they can randomly undo transactions of anyone else just to sabotage the system. A single double spend attack is not all that bad, but if a group does it continually it really stops making the blockchain useable


If there is one. If you have another PoW algorithm ready it would mean producing and stocking a bazillion other asics.

No one ever claimed investing in fiat is going to make you rich.
Bitcoin may (or may not) be an awesome investment, however, Im completely unconvinced a deflationary *currency* is a good form of money. the function of money is to represent value and facilitate trading things of value. The amount of money should therefore reflect the amount of "things" and at least grow along with the economy. If the value of the money itself increases, at who's expense does it do that? At the expense of those that grow the economy by creating those things of value that money represents. That really doesnt make a lot of sense. Rich people would gain from other people's productive labor.
Just take a look at BOMB for an extreme example. How much economic activity do you expect to form around BOMB? None. No one is going to use it for anything other than hodl on for dear life. People would rather go hungry than pay for food.  No one is going to lend you BOMB to start a business. If BOMB became a global universal currency, the few who got in early would become richer and richer without lifting a finger, they wouldnt invest, they wouldnt take risks, they have no incentive to,  they would just sit on their pile of ever growing wealth while the rest would need to sell both their kidneys to get hold of anything at all.

Intermittent mining will eventually become the norm, because free or even [negatively priced]( energy will always be only intermittently available. Currently, difficulty is still too low and mining hardware depreciation costs still too high, so intermittent mining is probably not yet viable. The result is predictable, mining happens where there is abundant cheap renewable energy that is available 24/7. That would be hydro. 
In the future even hydro, which can be throttled unlike solar and wind,  will become too expensive, and only local/temporary excess production solar and wind energy that can not be sold to the grid (and is currently free or sold at negative prices) will be viable.
Either way, no one will mine with electricity derived from coal or gas, because no one gives coal or gas away for free. Let alone pays you for using it.

Sounds like you dont understand the evil bitcoin wants to fight. Its not the evil of  "money". Money, regardless of its form, isnt evil by itself, its just a representation of value of things in the real world. Its what we use to trade so we dont have to barter. It isnt by itself evil, no more than value is evil. You might think humans are evil for wanting it, or doing evil things for it, but if so the evil is greed, not money; and absent money, they would simply be greedy for goods and services and still act evil.
I doubt you care, but the evil that bitcoin wants to fight, is the power people have over the rules of money and its supply. The corruption that comes with it. Bitcoin wants to be perfectly neutral. Following math rather than obeying authority.  That elimates the chance of corruption, but does nothing to solve problems of wealth inequality (if Im honest, its going to make it worse).
The fact you seem to have financial problems, is not the fault of bitcoin and probably not even fiat. Even eliminating money would not solve it. Youd still need stuff, like food, and need stuff to barter for that stuff.  Neither fiat nor bitcoin can solve your problem.

No not everyone. But lets do some math here for fun to illustrate the point.
Let assume the amount of people who heard of bitcoin is an exponential function.  Lets assume at inception, 5 people knew about bitcoin. And today, 10 years later its 1 billion.
Feel free to change those assumptions, it makes virtually no difference. Those numbers imply a doubling time of \~4 months.  How many more of those do we have left? 3 more and we are at 8 billion, we dont even have that many people. 4 billion of literate people seems optimistic, and that is just 2 more doublings. or 8 months at historical rates. Its inevitable that growth will slow down very soon, and almost certainly already has all but stopped.
Now lets compare that with price, for fun. We will start the clock here in 2011 at $1. Eight years later its \~$10K. Thats a doubling time of 6 months. Pretty close if you ask me, and that indicates  a strong correlation between them.
So just from people learning about bitcoin, you might see a factor 2- 3 or so  increase. But not what that chart shows. You will need to come up with other arguments then just more people discovering it.
edit: afterthought. The number of bitcoins in circulation of course also went up significantly. So the price alone is not correct, perhaps market cap is a better measure. Since market cap grew faster than the price, the doubling time of the marketcap will be lower than my 6 month estimate. Too lazy to do the math, dont think it matters a whole lot, someone else be my guest.

The fact gold is somewhat useful for jewelry and industrial applications, makes it a less suitable store of value, because you"ll have fluctuating demand for those applications that have nothing to do with its function as a store of wealth. An ideal store of wealth doesnt have that, just like you dont want money to have intrinsic value or be useful or in demand for anything other than paying. If there are secondary use cases or intrinsic value, like when coins where worth more in metal than their nominal value, this only creates problems.
Besides, gold is only popular for jewelry because its so valuable, not the other way around. Jewelry would look just as good using other metals, AFAIK, no one can tell the difference between real gold and good fake, or between silver and white gold just gold by looking at it.

Your lack of understanding the difference between mining and validating nodes doesnt make the article "biased". The issue isnt "mining farms", its that almost no one can use a large block system without trust, because you will not be able to run a full node without installing a few dedicated rack servers.  And no amount of mining centralisation changes that; when running my own node, I do not need to trust miners,  because miners cant fake blocks and can not make fake bitcoins. A "trusted" third party validating node however, can trivially dupe you into accepting fake bitcoins.

It has pretty much \*never\* been worthwhile ever since asics hit the market, not for people who need to outbid all the other idiots and buy these asics at ridiculous prices. The miners who (think that they) profited are either people who are not good at math and denominated their P/L in dollar rather than bitcoin  and simply profited from the BTC price hike.  The kind of people who spent 5BTC on a machine that mined 2 BTC and claimed victory because a year later 2 BTC was worth more than the 5 BTC originally. Or the ones who have access to those asics at closer to production cost as well as to cheap electricity.
You will have to wait for asic prices to come down even further to the point where their purchase cost is inconsequential compared to the electricity cost it will consume over a 12-36 month period. Then, and assuming you have access to below market or free energy, like having your own solar panels that produce more than you can use, then it might make sense again. You'll never get rich from it, but it might be better than having to turn off your solar panels.

Very simple: dont.
If mining was an easy way to make money by turning on a machine, everyone would do it. And anyone already doing it would do more of it. And then use their profits to do even more. Since overall mining revenue is fixed by the blockreward, its pretty obvious its impossible for everyone to make a profit. In fact, its entirely possible for everyone to make a loss. Which is pretty much what it does for anyone that needs to buy his miners and pay for his electricity.
Here is what mining really does: you pay, say, $10700 (todays btc price) in hardware and electricity, and you will mine anywhere between 0.5 and 0.8 BTC over the next few years. And morons will claim that is profitable when in 2 years bitcoin is worth $25K.
I can do better for you; send me 10700 today, and I will give you 0.9 BTC spread over two years. Or even immediately if you want. Lets call it accelerated high yield mining.

8MB blocks dont really solve anything. If BCH where to become as popular, trusted and widespread as BTC, it would take like 6 or 12 months for those blocks to fill up. Then you have the same problem, but worse because you will suffer an 8x larger blockchain forever, and you disabled segwit which is needed for all current proposed future scaling solutions (payment channels/sidechains/whatever). 
Its a simple technological fact that capacity in a decentralised blockchain is far from infinite, and cant be big enough to accommodate every possible use case. It cant even be big enough to handle a decent percentage of all online payments, and there are so many more usecases than simple payments.  Its also an economical fact that there are numerous applications for recording stuff in a permanent immutable ledger that are far more valuable than recording your pizza payment transaction. 
So  either adoption is ultimately limited (hopefully temporarily) by high network fees, where high value transactions simply out-compete pizza payments; or its limited by a blockchain that permanently becomes so big it stops being decentralised and/or stops functioning.  One of these approaches is reversible, network fees can drop if/when technological scaling solutions are developed for low value transactions or for transactions where higher centralisation may be acceptable. The other approach is creating a permanent, probably insolvable problem and along the way sacrifices the one thing that made bitcoin unique: decentralisation.
To use an analogy: big blocks is like seeing a brick wall in the distance and hitting the accelerator. Small blocks and high fees is hitting the brakes while you search for a way around that wall.

I think libra is doing us all a favor by exposing the difference between "blockchain" and  (real, open, censorship resistant) blockchain. My guess (hope?) is that ppl may begin to understand there is a difference, and seeing that "blockchains" that are faster/cheaper/easier/whatever than bitcoin isnt hard, isnt new, isnt exciting. Being truly unstoppable and censorship resistant even to government pressure, that is hard, new and exciting.
The fact several governments seem willing to clamp down on libra, and are able to influence it or possibly even stop it,  and that despite the fact libra is based on fiat  and willing to accommodate government regulations, just reinforces the point.

You dont need accurate estimates of all the variables to know its pretty much always going to be a crypto denominated loss. Its quite simple; ASIC producers also mine. They will sell you some hardware for the highest price the market will bare, so prices set by the most optimistic miners bidding the highest, and retail miner have proven time and again they can not do math and do not understand difficulty growth, let alone, exponential growth.  Even in the unlikely scenario their optimistic projections turn out to be realistic (or better yet, pessimistic) and mining is indeed profitable, then it will be more profitable for asic producers who will simply bring much more hashrate online themselves, since they have access to cheaper hardware, and in most cases, cheaper electricity, increasing difficulty and stealing the profits away from retail miners.
When you are price taker for bitcoin (which all of us are), a price taker for  electricity (which most of us are), and a price taker for mining hardware (which only producers are not), the only way you are going to profit is when your sellers give you that profit, for no good reason.

No mention of segwit. If BCH was only about a one time increase in block size, I wouldnt be too opposed to it. While x8 is a bit drastic, we can probably get away with it, if only just. But BCH doesnt support segwit or any proposed off chain scaling solutions, THAT is what makes BCH such a braindead idea. Because if successful, its inevitable BCH will hit the exact same wall as BTC, and the 8Mb will very soon need to become 16, 32, 64, ..  assuming that would even still work, you have then just killed everything bitcoin stands for.

But it isnt nonsense. Bitcoin started out as a paypal alternative (better in some ways, worse in others),  until its own success caused it to become something more similar to digital gold. There are ways to get transaction costs back to reasonable levels and increase scalability, but none have been proposed that can ever scale to paypal or visa levels. Which is fine by me, keep bitcoin as a super secure settlement layer, not entirely unlike gold under the gold standard, and build various more scalable, (but less secure and less censorship resistant) payment solutions on top of it.

Dr Jones is clearly clueless about Neo, which he only discovered recently. Ive been following it for a wee bit longer. He's assuming everything in the white paper is correct and implemented. But he clearly hasnt looked at the code yet. Have you?
BTW, dBFT is basically what Ripple uses. The "improvement" is that Ripple's UNLs are replaced by bookkeepers that are supposedly elected instead of selected by Ripple. Except of course, that part doesnt work yet, and if you think about the concept for more than 3 seconds, anyone with any knowledge of the subject will see how their voting process can not produce a secure decentralised consensus.  A tiny percentage of voting shares can get you as many bookkeepers as you need to control the blockchain. When I pointed out this glaring flaw in their concept, someone else reported it on their github, and the reply it got from the lead dev was mark the issue as "to be fixed later". And Neo pushers pointed out its not really a problem, because Neo can always issue more shares to regain control of the network. Which is actually true. There is nothing in the protocol to prevent the devs from signing in to existence as many Neo tokens as they want. Imagine that. Decentralised ? ROFL

You miss my point, entirely. Its a race to the bottom because the block rewards are fixed (and decrease with time), so the more hashing power comes online to extract any profitability that may exist. the higher difficulty becomes and the less each and every miner earns.  The result is that mining CAN not remain profitable for anyone with mining costs (hardware and electricity) that are significantly above those with the lowest mining cost. And there are people with zero and even negative electricity cost (more on that later) and anyone who builds their own ASICs has much lower mining hardware cost.  They are the one's that set the bottom you are racing towards. And you wont win.


OMG. You really dont get it. If it truly is profitable for someone or anyone, why would that person or company not expand their mining and earn more? What happens when they do? Difficulty goes up. So of course most mining farms have ridiculously cheap energy, over time they will need to have free or even negatively priced electricity or it wont make sense to mine.


Sure, but the same principles apply. Possible more so, as ASICS for less popular algorithms are even a less mature and competitive market than SHA ASICs, and they may not be using the same state of the art technology meaning they get obsolete much faster. GPU mining is a different story, but anything that can be mined with GPUs can be better mined with ASICs. ASIC resistance is a myth, and trying to achieve it just means ASIC development will cost even more, or even be done in secret. Lastly, with GPUs you are competing with "free" GPUs of all gamers in the world who buy their GPUs not for mining but for their games, and thus dont have to factor in that cost. Can you get free GPUs?


They are selling limited amounts of hardware at market prices. That is the restriction, you are paying what the biggest fools are willing to pay, even preorder months in advance based on flawed logic and a perpetual underestimation of difficulty growth,  and at those prices, you stand virtually no chance of ever earning back your hardware investment, because bitmain can deploy as many miners as they want for a tiny fraction of that cost. Have you even looked at prices how they keep coming down? how difficulty keeps shooting up, regardless of what BTC price does? You think its gonna stop anytime soon? 


You are wrong. Not only is there free electricity, there is increasingly negatively priced electricity. In Europe, there are 100s of hours per year where there is so much surplus of solar and wind energy, producers will not just give it away, but *pay* consumers to use electricity and keep the grid stable. And not just a little bit, they pay about as much as consumers would pay during peak consumption hours:
Right now, it doesnt make sense yet to mine intermittently with only free or negative priced electricity, because your hardware deprecation cost is too high, and we done have enough excess green energy production. Both those things will change.


Like I said, miners do not understand exponential difficulty growth. If you havent earned back your hardware in ~6 months,  chances of making it  in 60 years are pretty much zero, even with free electricity.


Fiat denominated. You think you made a profit because BTC value exploded. Or you where extremely lucky getting some of the very few retails asics that actually earned more than they cost in BTC, like the avalons or earliest asciminer boards. But those are not the rule. And if you think for 2 minutes, they couldnt be. Why would anyone, who has the smarts, funds and infrastructure to actually produce these machines that cost millions and months if not years to develop, sell you a machine for 1 BTC that they know can generate 2 BTC ?  here is what they will do; they will sell it for 2 BTC, or even 3 or 4 if miners are stupid enough, then  build 2 more machines for themselves to mine with, ensuring you dont even get to mine your expected 2 BTC. That is how it works.


If only you had any idea lol. Im getting too old to try to talk sense in miners. Go ahead, see how it works. Ive seen it too often.

What makes you think increasing the block size would even achieve what you think it will? If transaction fees are low, there are countless applications for storing data in a super secure,  immutable public ledger. From spam to storing contracts, source code, identities, timestamps, asset management, secure messaging, provably fair gambling, whatever. Oh and yeah, transmitting value. Many of those will be (far) more valuable than processing a pizza payment, so no matter what blocksize you pick, your pizza payment will eventually be out competed by more valuable transactions.
The effect large blocks has on transaction fees is therefore only short term and will phase out if adoption increases. But the effect it has on blockchain size, and thus decentralisation and trustlessness is permanent (at least until sharding becomes an option).
No block size is ever big enough, but its easily too big. The only real solution to this is layered off-chain solutions, where you can selectively sacrifice some of bitcoin's traits (censorship resistance, trustlessness etc) for transactions that may not require it, but need to be cheap.
Also keep in mind you need an incentive to develop these solutions. As long as transactions are cheap and space in the blockchain plentyful, who wil care to develop and implement off chain scaling solution? Who would want to use it, when its less secure and less decentralised? We need high fees to create demand for alternative solutions.
So until then, use paypal for your pizza. Or alt coins. But please dont undermine the long term security of bitcoin.

Thats not how  Shamir Secret sharing works. You wouldnt have 8 seed words, unless you have 3 of the shares  (or however many you configure) you only have gibberish. The trick here is that any combination of 3 out 5 (or however many you configure) shares gives you everything. Less than 3 gives you nothing. So if your bank burns down or a family member disappears, you can still reconstruct your seed. You have redundancy without increasing the risk.
BTW, if an attacker would somehow obtain a few shares, say 2, but less than the required number 3 then he has nothing.  He can not even try to compute the missing part, its mathematically impossible even with infinite computing power. Its "information theoretic secure":

Logic Fail. Bitcoin mining consumption does not scale with transactions at all. It uses exactly the same amount of energy if no one does any transactions at all, or if blocks all are full and regardless of their size. And it uses exactly the same amount of energy if we do thousands of layer 2 or layer 3 transactions per second.
Bitcoin mining energy only scales with block reward. Which goes down by a factor of 2 every 4 years, in so far its not offset by a value increase.

A hardware wallet. 
Im using ledger nano's myself. I do not wholeheartedly endorse them though. I just bricked one doing a firmware update. I had a second one specifically for this reason and to easily test seeds or as backup if the first would fail for whatever other reason, but that one is out of date and some apps, including ethereum no longer work. You can imagine Im in no rush to update its firmware and risk losing (secure) access to my btc. Ledger support is dragging their feet.
So if you are going to buy a ledger, i would recommend you buy 2, or even a buy a trezor as well; unless you are fine not having access for a week or so if something goes wrong with the first. And yes, you could restore the seed in a software wallet, but that makes buying a hardware wallet pointless.
The second issue is not ledger's fault, but hardware wallet support in bitcoin core is still very very rough. Borderline unworkable (CLI only). So you are forced to use a light client (ledgers own software or electrum). You can run electrum + electrum personal server + bitcoin core, but what a hassle is that...

No you can not. 
I dont have satellites, and Ive never been in space to see the earth is round, but like you, I still believe it because I know enough physics to understand the underlying laws of motion, the model that explains a spherical earth makes complete sense to me, and there is no sane case to be made for nearly all scientists on the earth to conspire and lie about their findings. 
Thats also why I "believe" in modern medicine, despite having *no clue* how my drugs work, but the scientific method is the best way to get to knowledge, and when my doctors and lab researchers follow that method, I trust their findings. Even if in 5 years new  data and new theories may contradict their current best understanding. . And its not because you can find a few crackpots who will make the case for homeopathy, or against vaccines or for a flat earth that any reasonably person gets to say these things are not settled. 
But for some (rather obvious) reason, when it comes to the health of the planet, you seem fine to question the scientific method or concoct enormous conspiracy theory to explain why basically all of them are lying and falsifying data or you differ to a few crackpots with an agenda.
 


So when your cardiologist or oncologist makes a diagnosis and suggests an urgent treatment, are you going instead going to drink homeopathic water, or have someone pinch needles in your ear lobe, or pray for a cure from some god? Are you that insecure?


The fact you bring this up in 2019 tells me you havent done any serious research yourself and you are just reading and reiterating climate change denier bullshit. Just like you would expect from a flat earther that gets all his knowledge from flat earth forums. This story has been peddled and debunked since forever and just the briefest of google searches would have revealed that:


No, scientists are not exactly "quick" to brush anything aside. You are quick to brush 100s of  years of scientific method  and 100s of 1000s of  man years  of scientific research aside because its conclusion doesnt fit your narrative.


There is your real motivation. Hint: politicians will seize any opportunity. But when was the last time politicians managed to force scientists across the globe to falsify their findings for over 50 years?
More over, for combating climate change, "wealth redistribution" is absolutely not necessary.  Its not because taxing carbon is a good idea that you cant reduce taxes elsewhere.

But thats my point; you cant use bitcoin today as a trustless blockchain on an ipad. If you can not run a full node that does its own verification, then you have to rely on on external trusted third party to do it for you.  And that third party can trivially dupe you in to accepting invalid transactions as being valid (something miners cant).
And while that may be an acceptable compromise sometimes, Im not suggesting everyone needs to run a full node all the time, the larger you make the blockchain, the more you will make that happen, and the less bitcoin is a trustless network.
As for the bandwidth; try running bitcoind on a 3/4G connection. And because you care about trustlessness, make sure its connected to at least a few dozen other nodes, and not rely on just one. I hope you have generous data plan.

I think most will have cashed out some, enough to solidify big profits. What they do with it is no different as what they  would do with any other big windfall,  spend it, invest it, by gold,  by real estate. I dont think many will have cashed out entirely;  the only ones cashing out entirely are probably people who gambled fiat for short term fiat profits, and probably not enough to be life changing. You wouldnt gamble life changing amounts on something you dont fundamentally believe in, and if you do believe in it, you wouldnt cash out entirely - if at all.

Here is how I imagine most people discover bitcoin:
Phase 1: they learn about bitcoin. They dont really understand  all its nuances and details, but they get the gist somewhat. P2P money, no banks (moons and lambos).
Phase 2: Then they discover all those newer altcoins that promise to be more advanced/better/faster/cheaper/programmable/private/onchain governance/blah blah and they are persuaded that bitcoin is "old" and "obsolete" in comparison. And expensive and slow and power consuming.
Phase 3: they discover there are some seemingly small trade offs all those alts need to make in order to be "better", things that dont quite work yet, they begin to understand that a crypto currency that is governed by anything, anyone or any mechanism, whether its through voting or delegates, or staking or trustlines or simply its developers ruling,  means ALL its properties, anything from its censorship resistance to future inflation rates are subject to change and thus to manipulation and corruption.
Then they discover why bitcoin was created in the first place.
You are stuck in phase 2.

I would advice against investing if you do not understand enough to keep your private keys at least moderately secure. You can download bitcoin core and configure it for testnet. Then get some coins on a testnet faucet and play around with it. Read about it. Watch videos about it. Only after you understand it at least on some level, you can begin to make sensible choices about whether or not to invest money in it. Then do more research how to do that safely. If that turns out to be too hard, then maybe its not such a great investment?

I just explained why it is an issue for the network. You will not solve the fee problem and/or you will remove the incentive to actually solve the problem. And every increase in size will decrease the number of users willing or able to run full nodes. Considering most internet usage is on mobile devices today, and even in the realm of PCs its usually laptop and SSDs, so you could argue 140GB is already too much to run a trustless network. As long as the blockchain grows linearly, eventually device capacity and bandwidth will catch up, but quadrupling it now would be a bad idea.

Lets change your example a little. We live in a cave and our only possession is one goat each. They are worth 500 coins, which we both have. You dont do anything all day except count your coins and hmm, enjoy your goat. I go out and build 2 houses.  Now suddenly, your 500 coins represent the value of 1 goat and 1 entire house.  You did nothing, *I* did all the work. Why should your money that used to represent a goat, now suddenly allow you to buy a house I built?

Do you not see the contradiction in that sentence? As long as you are pricing bitcoin in dollar, the dollar can not have "ended"
@_date: 2019-06-14 07:41:33
\&gt; Block rewards might be fixed, but the value of those block rewards are not, at least not in 2019.
You \*have\* to denominate your revenue in bitcoin, because your machines produce bitcoin. Bitcoin value may go up or down, no one can predict that. However, I can predict with extremely high confidence that any amount  of bitcoin you invest in mining will over a few years, produce less bitcoin than you put in. No matter what bitcoin value does. This has been the case for the past 8 years, and is not about to change for retail miners.
\&gt;Also, your flawed reality exists under the notion that old machinery stays on the network, and it doesn't. As newer, more power, yet more efficient machines enter the network, they are simply replacing the older, less efficient units. There is always profit to be made.
Lol, what? What does one have to with the other lol?
\&gt; Conversely, if this were true, I'd abuse the shit out of the system and only operate when getting paid to operate or when it was free, and I"d literally pickup all the **FREE** ASICs being tossed in the trash around the world.
Oh you could. And you would literally earn HUNDREDS of satoshis per month. Recycling the metals probably earns you more though.
\&gt;  Why are you continuing to comment about free/negative cost electricity, which simply doesn't exist at scale today and isn't being used? Furthermore, why do you think it needs to be free for mining to make sense? I pay 5.3c/kwh and deeply profit every single day, my energy doesn't need to be free or negative.
Germany last year produced 80GWH of excess renewable energy that was either given for free (or negatively priced), or dumped in giant underground heatsinks. Thats not including the energy that was not produced because wind turbines where feathered to protect the grid. Over the next decade, this is expected to grow by a factor of 10x. At that time, Germany would produce about the same amount of \*free\* (excess) electricity as bitcoin uses currently. And if they dont actually feather their turbines, it would have enough excess capacity to power bitcoin at least 5x over with otherwise useless electricity. That is Germany alone. Pretty small on a world map. Using this sort of excess energy may seem far away, but its not.
The only reason today it may seem to make sense to mine with 5.3c/kwh is because state of the art efficient asics are still too expensive in $/W.  Yes, purchase cost per watt used.  Im sure that will sound like a stupid metric to you, but its a crucial one that determines how much of your costs are in energy, and how much in hardware depreciation.  The actual hashrate and resulting mining revenue is far less relevant in the big picture, because difficulty will compensate for that.
Once upon a time, a state of the art miner would cost $30K and use  1500W (BFL mini rig). You dont even need to know hashrate, difficulty or bitcoin price, its obvious electricity cost didnt matter at all, I would have burned single malt scotch in a generator to produce electricity just to keep it running 24/7, especially since the machine would be obsolete in \~6 month. Lets use your electricity cost for a laugh. $5.3c/kwh  \* 1.5 KW = \~$2 per day. Hardware depreciation was \~$166 per day or 80x more. No one cared about cheap energy. These machines got hosted in datacenters with UPS power supplies and diesel backup generators.
Today a 2200W antminer miner costs \~$1000, and that miner may stay usable for 12 months, maybe even more. Energy cost \~ $2.8 per day using your prices, hardware depreciation cost \~$2.7.  Funny that. So obviously electricity cost already matters today. That ratio today is  two orders of magnitude different from what it used to be, but we are no where near the bottom.
That $1000 miner  by my estimate costs \~$100 to produce (excluding PSUs), and once we hit 7nm, efficiency improvements will finally taper off and miners are likely to remain competitive for 3 to 5 years. Lets assume they cost bitmain $200 and they can write them off over 3 years. Now hardware depreciation for them is $0.18 per day. Your "low" energy cost alone is 15x more than that. So even if you could buy that machine at the same price as bitmain, your overall mining cost are 15x higher than someone with access to excess renewable energy.  Even if that is only available for a few hours per day, you can not compete. Difficulty will adjust to a level that is profitable for bitmain and miners with access to even cheaper or (intermittent) free electricity and you will be mining at a loss.
This transition will not happen overnight, but it will happen, its inevitable. And of course, you will not be able to buy those miners at the same price as bitmain, you will pay market prices set by the largest idiots bidding the most.
\&gt; This is inherently false and shows a total misunderstanding of how pools work.
Oh that is so ironic, I dont know how pools work? Dude, if only you knew. I was exploiting pool payout schemes by hopping prop pools and earned 2-300% PPS for myself and at one point a non trivial amount of the entire bitcoin mining hashrate, probably half a decade before you even heard of bitcoin. I know how pools work.
When i said you will not likely earn back your investment over 60 years if you do not do so in 6 months, I was referring to the exponentially growing difficulty.  Humans are not very good at understanding exponential growth. This is a fantastic video on the topic:
Retail miners are particularly hopeless. This is a fact through self selection, anyone who does understand the arithmetic doesnt buy an asic at current prices, even when they have free electricity available like I do.. Most miners dont even understand increase in difficulty at all. Using mining calculators that assume no change in difficulty. Those are the miners that generate demand for asics at current prices, which means people who can do math, and do understand the game theory, can not mine. I shut down my last miner when the first asics hit the network, I predicted pretty much exactly what would and did happen, and I will not resume mining for profit ever. I may do it for fun when finally asic prices allow to me to mine without a guaranteed substantial loss, but even with my few KW free electricity, its never going to earn more than marginally above zero which is pointless at that scale. Large scale mining for profit will be done by the renewable energy producers or even grid operators, probably right next to the wind turbines to eliminate transmission costs. Simply replacing todays dump loads. Or it may be done anywhere where electricity is used to produce heat. Mining revenue would just subsidize the heat production a little. Until that time, mining will be done by asic producers and their mathematically challenged customers who dont mind paying more for hardware then it will conceivably mine in their lifetimes..
Your other points I think I addressed in my post below.

BCH is the love child of a technologically ignorant ideologue millionnaire who may have good intentions but is chasing an illusion and a deceitful mega miner who wants to protect his asicboost exploit, helped by a few less than brilliant devs (remember Bitcoin unlimited?).

If by entry and exit points you mean exchanges, then those are not part of bitcoin. Yes, governments can control those, and those are the places they will obviously apply pressure to, especially if they can not apply pressure anywhere else as is the case with bitcoin (not so much with say eos or ripple). But that has no impact on the working on the protocol itself, and putting obstacles at fiat on/off ramps may in fact achieve the opposite of their goal by spurring adoption; if you cant sell your crypto   for fiat without jumping through hoops or sacrificing your first born, you will want to spend it, thereby creating more demand for goods/services you can buy with bitcoin. If you are company that earns some of its revenue in bitcoin, and its too difficult to convert in to fiat, you will want to pay your suppliers or even employees in bitcoin. The ecosystem may be too small now for that to be really feasible, but government attempts to control it may well have the exact opposite effect.

Sigh. I think m gonna cry. One last try: I have no clue what BTC will be worth in 12 months, but I can spend fiat today to buy btc, or I can buy a miner that mines btc. If bitcoin price collapses,  you are screwed either way when you denominate it in fiat, and if bitcoin goes to $100K you make monster fiat profits either way regardless. The outcome is tied to btc price you can not escape that. Therefore the only useful question is which of both yields me more btc (regardless of its price in 12 months).  


Are you *seriously* calculating that with a fixed difficulty for the next 12 month? *Really?*

No one has so far come up with a way to substantially improve transaction speed and volume, without compromising some other aspects, like security or censorship resistance . Secure, scalable, censorship resistent: pick two. Then consider "secure" and "scalable" are nothing new, and can be done with databases.  Censorship resistance cant. Thats the big innovation of bitcoin, so I tend to agree with: "why compromise " - on the key aspect that sets bitcoin apart from traditional finance ?

I read it again, this time slower. I understand it now, and its a crude but usable solution if you have one or two incorrect words (but the order would have to be correct!). It basically uses the ian coleman webpage with a few changes to generate addresses from your incorrect seed with random modifications until it finds the segwit bitcoin address you are looking for.
I would rather you do this yourself, but if need be, Ill be happy to change ian's code with the modifications provided in that link, and give it to you. You would only need to modify the bitcoin address you are looking for, and to ensure I am not scamming you, run the tool while disconnected from the internet.
but since the modifications are just copy/pastes and well documented, I think you'll manage.
Im not entirely sure yet how to configure ian's page, but if you used segwit,  you will need to select BIP141. I would recommend you test by generating a new seed on your ledger, generate a bitcoin segwit address and then try the tool to see if it works and generates the same address. If it does, try the seed recovery procedure and change one seed word and see if it finds it. If it does that, all thats left is trying with your actual seed and bitcoin address.
Good luck!

I dont think you understand how LN works, because keeping private keys online is absolutely inherent to the scheme, and not a "missing feature" of the software. Its how it works. There is a reason its not considered a universal or ideal solution, and is only suitable for small values.
Moreover, you didnt answer my question; even IF somehow the online keys could be solved, and even IF somehow no one would need to settle onchain, you still need to transfer btc to your LN wallet. How are tens or hundreds of millions of people (never mind billions) going to do that with 50kb blocks?

I was talking about the cumulative difficulty, ie the number of hash operations performed, which is a proxy for the amount of energy and capital needed to modify the blockchain. Yes, that is security. If you think otherwise, go ahead and fork bitcoin's latest code, mine it on your CPU and tell me its anywhere remotely as secure as BTC. 


You must be new. Miners dont have anything like the power you think they have. When a consortium of the largest exchanges, bitcoin service providers and bitcoin miners that owned 80% of the hashrate tried to change the consensus rules, they failed.
Mining is also perfectly sustainable, and if you're worried about the polar bears, bitcoin mining is going to be the best thing that could have happened for green energy.

You wont need to download the entire blockchain, just like you can use light wallets today. Having to maintain a balance in your LN channel isnt different from having some funds in a mobile spending wallet while keeping the rest in offline cold storage. That makes sense with or without LN.
You dont need to be online all the time in order to spend LN funds. You do need to be online the moment you spend or receive, which really, isnt all that different from now. If you go offline before the channel is closed, there is a chance your counterparty will drain the channel (this is actually by design, to incentivise users to keep the channel in a working state).  That can be mitigated by using "watchtowers", who will watch the channel for you even if you are offline and counter the theft. All this can be hidden completely from the user, and will end up being part of your LN wallet software.
Will this require some third party service providers ? For most ordinary users, probably. But in a way that has less impact than using a light wallet provider today. There may be charges, but given the low costs of maintaining such a service, and the choice to pick any one you like, they are likely trivial, if not zero. How much do you pay today to use Electrum wallet nodes?

The software has to evolve, sure. Second layer solutions need to evolve. But saying the base layer consensus algorithm must be changed is something quite different. Bitcoin was designed to resist changes, thats pretty much the definition of being "decentralised and trustless". When you change the rules, it means someone is able to decide on those new rules. That might be necessary one day, but just saying "it has to evolve" suggests you dont understand bitcoin or decentralisation.

Because in LN, your private keys are online and vulnerable to hacking. If you sell goods or services, sums will accumulate and you cant leave a month or a years worth of revenue in a hot wallet. And a spender will drain his LN wallet and will need to replenish, which requires onchain transactions.

Why? With point of sale payment, you cant wait around for days until your miner finds a block and then quickly attempt a double spend attack (and who would even attempt that, and risk losing a 12.5 BTC blockreward for a $50 restaurant bill?). If you disallow replace-by-fee, the chance of doing a double spend attack in a different way is virtually zero. Online purchases are different; you can patiently wait for days/weeks/months until you find a block and then do your attack in (micro) seconds. Thats why you dont accept zero conf transactions online, especially not for things that you "send out" or settle instantly.

The NYSE is a trusted third party sitting between the listed company and the shareholders. Shareholders can only claim ownership through the exchange. I dont see how thats fundamentally different from the exchange issuing  an IOU representing the company share. I dont know how that works legally, but however it works, you could do the exact same thing with crypto tokens. Absent a legal framework, you give ownership to the entity issuing the tokens (IOUs). And whatever legal framework applies to the exchange enforcing the rights of share/token holders, could over time be applied to the entity that issues the crypto tokens.

No. There hasnt been a single planned, backwards incompatible change to the consensus rules, ie hardfork, ever.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:19:42
You got it backwards. Difficulty adjusts to the network, not the other way around. Difficulty only goes up as long as more miners join, and more miners will only join if its profitable. Profitability depends on the reward, which is composed of block reward, BTC price and fees.

1MB per 10 minutes is 52GB per year. A bit more with segwit and to account for indices and overhead but it will take more than a few year to hit terrabytes. That said, yes, too big a blocksize is a problem. Pruning helps, but you still need full archive nodes to bootstrap new nodes, and for your own security, you should bootstrap and verify from the genesis block, and not download some pre-pruned torrent, so you need the bandwidth too.
BTW, you really want to put the blockchain on a SSD. At the very least as long as your are downloading and verifying historic blocks. Its WAY faster (and less noisy)

I think you missed an opportunity here; clean energy is the cheapest source of electricity (latest solar plant in dubai iirc cost 2.4 dollar cents/KWH). In order to transition to renewable energy, as a society we either need massive overcapacity to handle variation in demand and supply,  or we need to store electricity which is very hard and expensive. 
Once bitcoin mining cost shift from writing off the hardware in a few months, to primarily electricity, miners will find the cheapest sources, and cheapest of all is free electricity, even if its intermittent.  Bitcoin mining offers a perfect way to monetise local, seasonal or temporary excess electricity production.  Transportation is not a problem, since you can deploy miners in a compact container and put them right next to the source. This is vastly more efficient than storing electricity in a battery and I cant think of a better way to finance the construction of renewable energy overcapacity. Either we'll need tax money to support this, or crypto mining.

Why risk even a small stack when I already have (multiple) hardware wallet(s) ? I'll already have to put private keys online for an even smaller stack when I use LN. Im fine with that as a compromise, but for anything bigger, not being able to use a hardware wallet makes no sense. And sure, someone has to do it, if that takes time, so be it, but please stop telling me its a bad idea or not necessary.

Thats going to happen anyway if/when production capacity catches up with market demand.

We can guess, but if you are basing your assumptions on what blockchain.info estimates as transaction value, you could be off by orders of magnitude.
If you want to include the "change value", then you can use this:
Download as csv, add them all up. But then if I send you 1 satoshi from an address with a single 1BTC input, you'll record that as 1 BTC transaction. Which is well, not 100% incorrect, but that Im sending myself 0.999999..  btc change to a new address, may not be relevant.

My source is common sense and experience. I cant get LN wallets to work yet, and Ive been using bitcoin since 2012. Segwit has been production ready since last summer, and only now is it getting adopted in some volume. Adopting LN is orders of magnitude more impactful. Lastly, we dont even have a solution yet for LN **mass** adoption, which will need routing rather than broadcasting everything to everyone. We only have some ideas on how to do that.

Real keys tend to be extremely hackable. Physical keys are by definition a joke, and keyfobs and "keyless go" solutions tend to be vulnerable. They are also expensive, expect to pay $300-$500 for a replacement. Its not that the hardware is so expensive, part of it is ripping off the customer of course, but its also the administrative work of verifying ownership and managing the electronic keys. Really, this is a real problem that blockchains can help solve.
And its not only one. Think mileage and maintainance and ownership records. If you're buying a used car, if that information is stored in a blockchain, you be sure that no one has tampered with those things, without needing to rely on a dealer to provide that evidence. A dealer who could be fraudulent, can go out of business, and of course charges money for his services. Then there is paying for electric charging, etc, etc.

Its more nuanced than that. If you use a decent online "wallet" like blockchain.info, they will not store your private keys, those keys are stored in your browser, and encrypted with a password that you supply. This is not bullet proof of course, your PC could be hacked and the blockchain.info scripts replaced my malicious scripts. You can improve your security by using an old (non rooted) smartphone and install the blockchain or any other wallet on that. These devices are relatively secure (certainly compared to a windows PC), especially if you dont use them for anything else. But for anything more than a small sum, I would strongly recommend a hardware wallet.

A bitcoin transaction is trustless, despite running on a centralised and not-trustless internet. The same is true for LN transactions, even if one day they rely on centralised and potentially compromised routing nodes.
As for economic centralisation; LN provides a very strong incentive against it. In order to become a major LN hub, you would need to put a lot of funds in a vulnerable hot wallet. No one wants to do that, especially when there is nothing to be gained from that.

Honestly, Im a little surprised and dismayed the core client doesnt encrypt the wallet by default and doesnt even seem to prompt you to do so. I cant think of any reason why you would want to have an unencrypted wallet, and even if someone can think of a reason, that should be opt-in.
That said, wallet encryption doesnt help if your machine is hacked and someone installs a keylogger. A hardware wallet really is the way to go.

What no one else mentioned; simply increasing the blocksize would be backwards incompatible, and thus result in a hardfork. That comes with all kinds of risks, and people may not follow it. With segwitt, we accomplished an effective ~2-4x blocksize increase with a softfork, ie completely backwards compatible, even the original satoshi client is still compatible (though obviously it wont support segwitt, it will still work and see current blocks as valid blocks) .
One day, we probably will need a hardfork, but this is not a decision to be made lightly or under extreme time pressure, and will require a very broad consensus.

Whats with the whitepaper obsession? It doesnt mention encrypting wallet.dat either. Shouldnt we have added that to the client? 
Like I said, its important to distinguish evolving the software and second layer solutions, from "evolving" the consensus algorithm. Softforks are fine, no one is ever forced to follow them. Dont like segwitt? Dont use it. Dont like LN? Dont use it. But the consensus algorithm, which is the core of bitcoin, is not something that needs or even can just evolve. If ever we need to change it, that will be a major and probably highly problematic, contentious and dangerous event.

I dont get your point; it takes only 2 to use LN, but anyone could have started using segwit by himself since last summer.
Anyway, the idea that LN can go mainstream in less than a year seems ludicrous if you've followed the progress over the past few years, if you've tried the current LN wallet implementations, and consider all the things that arent done yet. 
And even if this gets rolled out much faster than I think, its not going to solve on chain transaction fees, because almost none of the transactions being conducted today, which tend to be large value, and a significant portion of which are intra exchange transactions,  would be suitable for LN. LN will enable new use cases, not replace a significant portion of current use cases. And LN will require more onchain transactions to fund and withdraw LN balances. 
In short: even if LN gets widespread adoption this year, it still seems inevitable on chain fees will go up again.

Production volume is no where near enough to satisfy demand yet. Hence preorders that sell out, waiting lists, enormous hardware margins, and the fact difficulty continues to go up exponentially regardless of what btc price does. No one is turning off their miners yet. This wont last forever. 
Eventually, bitmain may chose to mine themselves rather than sell hardware nearer marginal costs, but as long as difficulty doesnt stagnate and/or follow btc price, you can be sure there is a shortage of asics, and mining is still "too" profitable, and thus you have artificially inflated asic prices.

Chloe, no offense, but you need a clue (couldnt resist that pun). Spending electricity is the whole point of PoW mining. Proof of work. Work that is done by converting electricity in to provable math. Miners asking for more energy efficient solutions is just ridiculous, all that will do is make them require more hardware to spend the same amount of electricity. If they cant make a profit from mining, they should stop buying overpriced miners. If they cant make more from mining than they spend on electricity, they should unplug their devices, or find cheaper or  free (excess renewable) electricity. 
As for the overall power consumption of mining; believe it or not, that will turn out to be a good thing for the environment. See this post:

The reasons for not increasing the blocksize (for non segwitt transactions) has nothing to do with subsidizing miners. It has everything to do with the fact it requires a hardfork, which is something everyone with a clue wants to prevent for as long as possible, because hardforks are risky and potentially divisive. Bitcoin has not had a planned hardfork since its inception (Im ignoring some bug fixes that one might interpret as a hardfork). One day, we will have to, but that better be a very well tested fork, based on a very broad consensus, and its probably wise to take the occasion to fix more than just the blocksize limit.

How is this different from assets being traded on an exchange? Serious question, I dont know the answer. I assume the exchange "owns" the assets, and anyone buying stock on that exchange, only gets a claim to the exchange, correct? You could do something similar for crypto, a holding company that legally owns the stock and issues the tokens on a blockchain. Anyone buying the token gets a claim to that holding company. Over time, that holding company could become regulated to the point of becoming unnecessary, or it could be the issuer himself.

Sure, no one can be certain that bitcoin will remain the dominant CC.  Something better might come along and take its place. But then bitcoin will devalue and the other token will gain value. But thats not the point Schiff tries to make. He thinks any new crypto devalues/inflates bitcoin. Thats just not true. 


The supply of "superior" cryptos will always be limited. 
And miners dont mine bitcoin because they "believe", but because they follow their financial incentives. They will mine whatever makes them the most profit. That a majority mines bitcoin is because bitcoin is the most valuable token, generating the most mining revenue, and that in turn, makes it more secure, and thus valuable. And that is a network effect that is comparable to facebook. Facebook is only valuable because so many people use it. And many people use it because using a social network with hardly any users serves no purpose. Replacing facebook is therefore not a question of making a similar website, you will need something vastly more attractive to solve the chicken and egg problem. Just like any cc that wants to replace bitcoin.

That not the appeal I see. The main appeal I see is a trustless digital store of wealth and medium of exchange. Something that didnt exist before bitcoin came along. You can pay your online purchases with visa or paypal, they work fine. But they are not trustless and are IOUs. Bitcoin, exposing you to no counter party risk,  is a great hedge against a financial crisis and censorship by governments or corporations. Its like electronic gold, only much easier to store, move, spend, convert (and immune from future asteroid mining ;) ). And so much harder to counterfeit.
The value extends beyond that however; an ultra secure, immutable public ledger has a wide range of future applications, which will require tx fees, and thus bitcoins.

Either way, we'll continue to go down until people think its not worth it to recover some funds anymore and just give in.

This is not true. You can fork bitcoin, but it will be worthless as a store of value. Why? Because you'll be mining it on a single PC, and with my miners, I can rewrite your blockchain in an afternoon and claim all your cloned bitcoins. Bitcoin has value because it is unbelievably secure. No other fork can replicate that without also replicating the  billions in hardware and bazillion gigawatt hours of energy that went into creating the blockchain.

Yes, thats how it can get kickstarted. But thats only really true for PoW blockchains. And good luck making a "universally" better PoW blockchain than bitcoin. If anything is to replace bitcoin one day, I think its much more likely to be a radically new concept.
Besides, alternative PoW blockchains have another enormous disincentive. Any blockchain that only has a tiny fraction of bitcoin or ethereums hashrate, can easily by 51% attacked. So they are not just less secure because their absolute hashrate is lower, they are vulnerable simply because they are not dominant. TenX recently did a video on this, to explain why they do not accept BCH. They fear its far too easy for a large BTC pool to reverse a BCH transaction and do double spends.

LN, even if it becomes centralised (doesnt look like it on testnet so far), will still be trustless and no more centralised than the internet itself. Your bitcoin node already relies on centralised nodes, ISPs and routing tables to connect to other nodes. LN is no different in that regard. If anything, its less centralised, because your LN client can chose and determine whatever route to follow. Your bitcoin node can not, it can select the destination, but your ISP and backbone providers determine the route for you (and know the endpoints, unlike in LN). You can improve the issue with bitcoin nodes by running Tor. Which uses the exact same onion routing approach as LN, and uses directory servers to help you find a route to the end point; something we may need to scale up LN one day.  And it wont be a problem, unless you think using bitcoin on Tor is worse than not using tor.
@_date: 2018-07-11 12:19:24
You lack imagination, or knowledge. The point is not storing everything in bitcoins blockchain directly, the point is using its blockchain as a source of trust, similar to what RSK does, or Komodo. You can build scalable sidechains with high capacity/low latency that by themselves are not nearly as secure as bitcoin, but that gain trustlessness by storing snapshops in bitcoin once every x hours or days.

Its not the FUD. The FUD might be a trigger, but the underlying reason is that no one knows how to valuate crypto's. So as long as it goes up, people buy because it goes up, without paying much attention to absolute valuation. And when it goes down, people panic and/or start looking at absolute valuation again. It will continue to bounce between delusional ATHs and depressing panic ATLs until we come to some broad consensus what these things are actually worth.

I have a few KW of free electricity too, and I just cant justify the hardware expense of buying miners, as at retail prices, it seems extremely unlikely they will provide a positive ROI (measured in the crypto they mine, which is the only way to measure it. It can make a fiat denominated profit if crypto prices rise, but you can speculate on that cheaper by just buying those tokens).

The energy is free, the electricity usually isnt. But often times it is. Not just free, even negatively priced.  And that will become more and more common. Read the link I posted at the end of the post you replied to.


Exactly, which his why at times its free. And as we increasingly switch to renewable but intermittent sources like solar and wind, we will increasingly have periods with a large overcapacity that results in free or negatively priced electricity. Which is why POW mining will be such a boost to the environment, by monetizing excess capacity when grid demand is low, thereby making green energy development affordable and even adding more capacity to the grid to handle peak loads. Again see the link.

Not independent blockchains. You could consider sharding as being multiple blockchains, but those shards must be kept consistent with one another, and that consistency can be called the 'master' blockchain.

A social network with 1 user has zero value.A social network with 10K users has pretty much zero value. But a well connected LN hub has as much value as any other. More over, obtaining a user base that is just 0.1% of facebook to become even relevant is going to cost billions (and still be largely pointless). Setting up a LN node costs pretty much nothing.


You realize Binance is working on a decentralised exchange, right?  The current inconvenience largely stems from technological limitations, which are being worked on. Stable coins, atomic swaps, submarine swaps etc. Centralised exchanges will yield to decentralised ones, its just a matter of time.


You completely miss what trustless means in this context. Crypto is trustless in the sense that there is no requirement for a trusted intermediary, like a bank or a notary or exchange or payment provider, to manage a transaction ledger and "store your private keys". The blockchain is its own source of trust. You can have your own keys.
But this doesnt mean that with crypto you can not chose to use a trusted third party for when that adds value. If a retailer wants to offer escrow payments to induce trust with potential customers, they can and they should. If you use Bisq or localbitcoins, the bitcoins are held in escrow, because you are trading with an untrusted third party. Thats totally fine. But the escrow agent only needs to be trusted to make a fair decision when there is a conflict, and you are not trusting him with any funds. And its entirely optional, both parties are totally free to select any escrow agent they wish on any conditions they wish. 


Amazon wields so much power over credit card companies, they probably dont really have a problem. But ask yourself why they dont accept paypal and talk to third party resellers on amazon.  That said, dispute mediation for online trade of goods or services is not a problem that crypto claims to solve by itself. It can only offer similar solutions as with fiat when the parties do not trust each other.  But if you feel you can trust amazon, then why are you or they paying credit card fees?

Having a third of those people adopt LN software that clearly still is experimental, buggy, not very userfriendly and not very useful yet, is stunning and gives me so much hope.
Of course, in reality there probably are much more than 10K nodes, as I just discovered bitcoin core client by default doesnt enable uPnP forwarding, so most nodes are probably invisible. Mine was until a few weeks ago.

First of all, sorry for your loss.
Secondly, almost everyone posting so far assumes you have access to his bitcoins. I strongly suspect you do not, but have access to his exchange account, like coinbase, kraken, bitstamp,... but not his actual bitcoins.  Correct? Exchanges hold the bitcoins for the account holder, but are regulated and you should assume they will comply with IRS and other agency requests. So even though you could withdraw the bitcoins to an account of your own, and sell them if you want, doing so might be illegal and its certainly not anonymous. 
To do this legally, contact the exchange, ask them what to do. You will need paperwork like death certificate and something establishing you as his heir. You would better also declare this for taxes if thats applicable in the US.
If you actually have access to his bitcoin wallet, then its a slightly different story. Legally it may not be different, but it would be like finding a envelope full of cash in his house.

Opening/closing LN channels still requires on chain transactions. So if anything, if LN really ever takes off and becomes used by 100s of millions of users, we will have a problem of not having enough block space to accommodate opening/closing channels. We may need layer 3 solutions to solve that.
But even so high value transactions will still take place on chain, because LN transaction require the private keys to be online.

No. Whats unsolved is finding the **shortest** route in a mesh network without having the full map. This is the traveling salesman problem.
But salesmen arent out of a job and travel all the time. Likewise in LN, you dont need to find the shortest route, you need to find **a** viable route.

Thats not the point. The criticism of LN being centralised is that routing nodes (if/when they are ever implemented, they dont even exist yet) can be attacked. Which is as relevant as saying ISP routing tables can be attacked for bitcoin transactions. Both are true, neither have any impact on the security or trustlessness of transactions.  If anything an attack on ISP routers could selectively block or reroute transactions, because the information is all open and unencrypted. LN transactions are onion routed and encrypted, essentially blackboxes for anyone but the parties involved.

How are you going to validate a transaction and check the input address has sufficient balance if you do not know the amount being sent or the balance of the input address ?
As impossible as it sounds, it actually might be possible with some fancy cryptography called zkSNARKs. This is cutting edge, arguably insufficiently researched and proven at this point, but may find its way in to bitcoin later.
For now though, simply use a different receiving address for every transaction and/or use lightening network to increase your privacy. Transactions are public, but ownership of addresses are not.

Bitcoin is almost 10 years old (or young) and has reached  ~0% of visa. From there to visa levels of adoption in 2.4 years, thats just ridiculous wishful thinking. If we get 10% of visa in 10 years, I would consider that an astonishing success.

To create a blockchain as secure and immutable as bitcoin is going to cost you 10s of billions in hardware and energy with no guarantee of adoption. Forking the software is easy and free, creating the PoW is anything but.
By contrast, capturing and mining an asteroid with more gold and platinum than currently exists on earth, is probably significantly cheaper than that.  A caltech study suggests it would cost $2.6B to mine an asteroid that can have &gt;$50B worth of gold and platinum:
its ironic that the biggest objection is that doing so would crash the market price of gold and platinum. Because unlike bitcoin, those metals are not truly scarce, they are in fact extremely abundant. Its only a matter of time before its technically and economically feasible to bring them here. And that time is going to be measured in decades, not centuries. Gold may have a 4000 year history as store of value, it certainly doesnt have a 4000 year future. More like 40 years.

Its a step in the process. First they accept bitcoin from end users like us, and yes, most companies will convert to fiat, because their costs are in fiat, they buy their products with fiat, the pay their employees and taxes in fiat.  But as companies increasingly accept bitcoin from customers, they can also begin using some of their bitcoin revenue to pay for goods and services to other companies, maybe even some wages, in some jurisdictions even taxes,  and over time become less and less reliant on fiat conversions. This wont happen over night, but accepting crypto, even when its instantly converted, is a crucial first step.
Do they have to ? Of course not. But aside from potential savings compared to accepting paypal or visa, if there are sufficient number of bitcoin owners looking for ways to spend their coins, it would be in the interest of these companies to accept crypto before their competitors do.  Today that may not sway Amazon yet, or the hairdresser from the post below (true cypher punks dont get haircuts), but if I was a lambo dealer or a VPN provider, you bet I would accept crypto.

Blockchains allow the transfer of value, without third party intermediary. That sounds simple, but its actually difficult to understand and explain, especially when the "value" in question is money and you're talking to a "nocoiner" who can not yet grasp that money is not backed by something, and simply a ledger entry. 
So instead of trying to explain that, I use this example these days:
A really simple use case. A paper ownership document (Bill of laden, which represents the value of the goods on a container ship or the like) is replaced by a smartcontract that can be transferred over a blockchain instead the paper needing to be sent around the globe with a courier.  No trusted intermediary needed, much faster, more secure and billions of potential cost savings.
Why cant you use a database to transfer ownership? In theory you could. But shipping companies still use paper sent around with a courier instead of a database because there is no central party that would be trusted to manage the database by all trade partners all over the world. No one wants to be beholden to a party that falls under a foreign and potentially adversarial jurisdiction, or the potential for abuse and fraud. Its the same reason its still difficult to send money from say China to Iran to Taiwan. Its not like that is a difficult technological problem using banks databases, its a problem of trust and authority.  A decentralised, open blockchain solves those problems. its a database everyone can trust.

Did you think the Belgian Franc would always exist?
The euro is a single debt based fiat currency with a single interest rate and a single exchange rate for a variety of countries with their own very diverse fiscal policies, their own budgets and budget deficits,  bond markets, their own economies and their own needs. I dont believe that can work. Countries like Greece, Italy and Spain simply have too different needs than Germany, they cant afford a strong euro and the inevitable increasing interest rates. But Germans will revolt if the ECB would try to weaken it or when german tax payers have to cover italian debt.  Its not tenable and it will collapse.  We cant even agree who has to accept or pay for a few busses worth of refugees, which costs us next to nothing, but when it comes to sovereign debt, we are talking about trillions.
But even if Im wrong, if it is possible to have a transnational fiat currency with such diverse economies, then why stop at europe's borders? There is no reason then we couldnt have a global fiat currency, and so thats what we will get. an IMF coin.
Either way, the euro isnt here to stay. But thats not why Im betting on bitcoin.

Im not one of those who predicts bitcoin will replace fiat any time soon, if ever. Right now, it appeals in specific niches. Like gold, its a hedge against a financial collapse (I do not believe the euro is here to stay). Its a more private censorship resistant online payment solution, better than say, prepaid visa cards. 
But most of all I suspect bitcoin (or something like it) will work in the background, become an invisible settlement layer for other blockchains and layers built on top of it for a variety of use cases. Basically every time you have a database that contains records that directly or indirectly represent value, open blockchains provide a lot of opportunity. Why would we store house property titles or "bodem attesten", or marriage contracts or wills or diplomas or patents or company registrations and share ownership and all those things in fragile, hackable databases? Databases that need to be managed by a trusted third party which makes it an expensive, often monopolistic entity that needs to be regulated and requires oversight, when a blockchain can do it better? 
I think its only after we begin using open blockchains for all those things, when our cars pay for their own electricity and execute contracts with our solar panels and electricity meters,  our medical records and access to those records is managed by blockchains,  that the public at large may begin to trust these systems and realize their potential. If its good enough to store the ownership of a house, perhaps its good enough to store my bank account.

Have you read even the first thing about LN?


Sigh. Why would anyone have a LN balance? Because you need to have a balance in order to make a LN payment, and you get a balance whenever someone pays you through LN. But your balance can be used to route other payments between parties who do not have a direct connection.  A LN wallet is like a spending wallet. Yes, its less secure, its online, like a hot wallet, if your PC is vulnerable than your LN balance is vulnerable; its meant for small everyday purchases. Like the cash in your wallet which is more likely to be stolen than cash in a vault, but far easier to use for everyday stuff.

Not at all. For the foreseeable future, if I buy a house or a lambo with bitcoin, most sellers will  convert those bitcoins in to fiat via an exchange, where they become available for anyone to buy. As bitcoin becomes more common, the car dealership or the contractor that builds the house may want to keep some of those coins and not convert everything. Is he a whale now? Later on he may start paying his employees in bitcoin. 


Thats a nonsensical question. Before  bitcoin becomes even remotely as widespread as current representations of wealth like fiat, its value will have to skyrocket. Which will make people who got bitcoins at 1/10th or 1/100th or 1/1000th of the price suddenly rich. How many of those do you think will just sit on their coins expecting the rocket to climb forever, while living in a basement and driving a 15 year old trashed car? Not a single one.  Ive seen bitcoin go from $3 to $20000. As a result, I now have about ~10 percent of all the bitcoins I once had. Why? Because I had no crystal ball. I spent and sold bitcoin at $5, $50, $250, $1000, $5000 and $12000. And Ill spend more at 50K, 100K, .. wherever it goes. So will everyone but the most brave or most foolish hodlres.
What is true is that if bitcoin takes off like that, there will be a huge transfer of wealth, from nocoiners to early adopters, from bankers to cypherpunks. How is that bad? Why is the current distribution of wealth more honest?

Bitcoin mining cost are hardware depreciation + energy cost, and that sum scales with the value of the ledger multiplied by an ever decreasing block reward + tx fees. Increasing hashrate is just a side effect of technological innovation, that allows higher performance per watt, but its the cost, not the hashrate that matters.
That said, energy is also not an important measure. Energy can be free and energy doesnt pollute. An unused football field or similar sized forest or lake uses roughly 10KW of solar energy. Should we ban forests and lakes? What matters is pollution and carbon emissions. On that metric, PoW crypto mining will not just become carbon neutral, its actually gonna become carbon negative:
Thats never gonna happen with gold mining or fiat.

First of all, exchanges can still charge relatively high fees because its hard to become a trusted high volume exchange. Really frigging hard. The barrier to entry is utterly incomparable to setting up a LN node. Especially if factor in fiat trading pairs that require all sort of regulatory compliance. Last but not least, as unfortunate as I find it, many seem fine using exchanges as banks. Many seem quite willing to pay for the perceived security of not being in control of their own private keys...


None that are as convenient and as liquid as normal exchanges. Bisq has really low liquidity, doesnt allow you to purchase bitcoin if you dont already have bitcoin, greatly limits amounts, trades may take a week to clear and people may not trust the fiat transaction with an unknown third party who might be able to reverse it.
Over time all that may change, but fact is today most people are willing to pay extra for the premium service of a centralized exchange.  There isnt much premium service one LN node can offer over any other.


Because fiat transactions are reversible and fiat accounts custodial. LN is trustless, like bitcoin. Of course you may still need to trust the goods and services you want to buy, but thats not a fiat or crypto issue.

Try do the math on how large blocks would need to be for "the whole world" and how that would impact the blockchain size in another decade or so; you'll find out you couldnt possibly run a full node to transmit, store or verify those blocks on anything less than a Google or Visa sized datacenter. Not even sure that would do it.  Whatever you have then, is no longer a trustless P2P decentralised currency and more akin to the worlds least efficient financial database ever imagined.
Permanent storage space in an immutable, distributed P2P ledger replicated to and verified by every full node in the network, is simply too valuable to hold every single payment of everyone in the world ever. Its impossible, and frankly, daft.
You need sidechains and off chain payment channels that only occasionally settle on the blockchain.  At which point, block size becomes mostly a moot point.

That is quite literally impossible. The only way for "yet-another-fake-satoshi" to give credibility to his claims is the opposite: signing a message with his private keys, proving they are not lost. Even if somehow  YAFS can give credibility in other way, like by using his PGP key, him saying he lost the keys still proves absolutely nothing.
That said, Im sick and tired of reading this same nonsense for the 546546th time. Have another downvote, while I do another copy paste:
Aside from the obvious fact that without cryptographic evidence (signing a message with private key or PGP keys), every "I am satoshi" claim should be dismissed out of hand, this one in particular is sooo obviously not written by Satoshi. Its clearly written by someone who knows nothing thats not in the public domain and just rehashed a story thats been written a 1000 times based on sources like these emails: 
I googled a few keywords from paragraphs that seemed specific, and each time the above emails came up and everything in that paragraph could be read in those emails.
But the author clearly lacks a deep understanding of what he's writing about. Just the first sentence says it all: " I embedded in the coinbase of the first genesis block."
Anyone who understands anything about bitcoin knows there is only 1 genesis block. That its the first block is by definition. No way in hell satoshi would refer to the genesis block as the first genesis block.

 technically an internet ISP or cabal of ISPs could censor your transactions. And while that may represent an actual threat, that doesnt mean it makes sense to describe bitcoin as peer-to-isp-to-peer.
Bitcoin is all about incentives. As others have explained, a single miner can not censor anything, it would take all miners/pools to successfully censor a transaction. And even then at least in theory you could still buy or rent hashrate and mine your own transaction.
When we describe bitcoin as P2P, its not so much the censorship resistance, its about the custody. Miners at no point take custody of your private keys. Ownership of the tokens goes directly from the sender to the receiver.  Miners are needed to make that happen, but the same applies to an internet connection.

Stay VERY far away from investing in bitcoin mining 'opportunities'. This is nothing like buying gold mining stocks that correlate with gold price, because unlike gold, bitcoin mining is zero sum; you will almost certainly lose your money regardless of what bitcoin price does.
Do some research before you invest. If you're not willing to put in some research to understand what you're getting in to and how to use it, I strongly recommend you do not invest at all. 
but if you do, as others said, buy a hardware wallet (trezor or ledger nano S), open an account at an exchange, then transer your bitcoin to your own wallet.

You can valuate stocks based on the underlying assets, revenue and profits of the company.  If anyone found a reasonably objective and sensible way to do that for crypto assets, Im yet to read it. Moreover you can profit from holding stocks even without selling. You know, dividends. So no, its not the same thing. 
Anyway, given Buffets aversion for technology and his desire to invest in established blue chip companies based on long term fundamentals, its no surprise crypto isnt his thing. He avoided the entire internet bubble but also missed the post bubble internet explosion. His idea of finally investing in technology was buying IBM in 2011. Yeah, i could have told him that wasnt the best idea.
I just wish he was more honest and would say: "I dont invest in it, because I dont understand it". Or even "because I cant predict it". That would be an entirely reasonable and valid reason to stay clear.

As do I. But Im okay with the evolution. Let governments or banks make private blockchains that they maintain control over. As Andreas call its, intranets of money. Baby steps. That will just grow the entire ecosystem and get people and developers used to it. Open decentralised blockchains will always have the edge because they are open to innovation and truly incorruptible. Over time those private permissioned blockchains will be replaced or connected to other blockchains and pegged to open blockchains. They will basically become bitcoin sidechains.

No, they dont, neither of them. They dont represent value. In the case of fiat,   it gains value because  we have trust that most debtors will repay or at least service their debt. Thats why we are willing to exchange things of value for that debt. In the case of bitcoin, because we have faith others will want to own bitcoin. But that value is not what they represent; if we lose faith in a countries ability to service its debt, or we lose faith in demand for bitcoins, then their value collapses.

Thats no less silly than saying bitcoin is worthless. Both fiat money and bitcoin are basically accounting systems, they are just accounting for different things. 
Its also incorrect to say fiat is backed by government debt. Fiat money is a representation of debt. Fiat money IS debt. government, corporate, private debt.   Thats not bad or evil, its just like a double entry accounting system where debit always equals credit. When your company balance has nothing on the debit side, it has nothing on the credit side either and is worth nothing. Likewise,  without debt there is no fiat money, without money there is no debt. 
Bitcoin doesnt represent debt, what it does represent however, is arguably even less tangible. Numbers on a blockchain.

You can still buy (used) cars with cash from an individual, but when you buy from a dealer/company, you have to pay the bulk of the sum with a bank cheque or bank transfer or your credit/debit card. You can only pay a small percentage using cash. House purchase always needs to go through a notary and bank. Even when renting, the safety deposit needs to be in a special bank account. I also doubt its possible to pay taxes with cash, but I cant say I looked that up or tried.

No offense, but you dont, actually.


"Their money" is also just debt. Someone else's debt.  **Every** dollar/euro/yen is a representation of someone's debt.  Fiat money is created exclusively  from debt; based on loans or government bonds. And fiat is destroyed as loans get repaid. It IS debt. And as such, it represents the exact opposite of value. Value is all the actual stuff you can trade for money.

No, its not created from nothing. Banks create money based on the borrowers pledge to repay the debt.  And as the debt is repaid, the money is destroyed. You can do this yourself too btw. Just write a note that says you promise to repay the bearer X dollar/euro. Give the note to someone who trusts you,  as payment for whatever goods he is selling. There, you just "created money from nothing".  Fiat money is an IOU, and is nothing else than the representation of someone else's debt.

Some alt coins have merit and may have a bright future, but most wont, and everything is going up, even the most idiotic, old, pointless and defunct coins. Poloniex is a casino, with people gambling on coins instead of a color on a roulette table, and its a disaster waiting to happen. How that will impact BTC, is anyone's guess. It might greatly profit from it, if polonians convert to BTC and hold that, or it may tumble if they convert to fiat. Either way, pulling your money out of anything other than BTC, ether, and possibly maybe litecoin, is a good move.

Well, theirs is legal tender, ours isnt. But there has to be a difference for the system to work; how would you feel if you were obligated to accept any IOU issued by every Joe Doe?  
Banks formalize or replace the trust that would otherwise be needed between the issuer and every recipient of debt.

Nothing comes close to bitcoin when it comes to:
- Security (PoW, hashrate, conservative development)
- Merchant adoption and infrastructure
- Name recognition / trust
Will it ever go obsolete? Maybe, but not until someone comes up with a way to secure a blockchain that is as secure as PoW (PoS is not). For many applications, compromises to security may be acceptable and systems based on PoS or (d)BFT will prosper; bitcoin wont be the one coin that rules them all, but if it survives the next 6 months, it will probably continue to be the 'gold standard' for storing value.

its never from nothing. Its always based on a pledge to repay. That can be a pledge from an individual or a government, but when I sign a legally binding document that states that I owe you $1M, I hope you wouldnt say you got "nothing".

Its not really an explanation though. I didnt create all those addresses, or at least not knowingly. When pool mining, which I did, payments where sent to whatever single address I gave, a pool cant create addresses for me.

So to have just a 1% chance of double spending, you need ~1000 Antminer T17s, or over a million dollar worth of the latest unavailable hardware. You call that trivial?  If you have access to that kind of hash rate, are you really going to devote it to have a 1 percent chance on a free pizza? No one sane is worried about that, credit cards  probably have a higher overall fraud percentage than that and those are not restricted to people with a million worth of mining hardware.


AFAIK your counterparty has to be online, as you cant send LN offline. You may generate a tx offline that may be valid for a day or whatever, but then that means your and/or your counterparty hardware wallet has to connect every day, I cant call that a cold wallet. Its a hot spending wallet. Hardware would be better than software on PC, but its no panacea.

Deflation leads to ever increasing concentration of capital, as who-ever has the most money earns the most money even when doing nothing productive. This is basically a return to feudalism.
Deflation also is a dis-incentive for investment (why risk your wealth if you get even richer taking no risk), so it kills risk capital formation that innovation and startups depend on.
High wealth concentration has historically proven to be bad for the economy, for an efficient economy you need a more flat distribution of wealth, and the reason should be pretty obvious; the super rich never spend all their money, and the poor can not spend, even if they wanted to.
Taxes can be used to reduce the wealth gap, but of course the same people who say deflationary currency like bitcoin is better than controlled inflation, also say taxation is theft. And good luck collecting fair taxes when your capital is in anonymous crypto wallets.

They do it for a reason; the buyer might file a dispute and demand a chargeback and PP doesnt trust you will cover the expense if that happens. 
Everyone here loves to hate paypal, but the reality is that with bitcoin, we would need a similar system where funds are held in a 3 way multisig wallet with a third party arbiter, and only release the funds to the seller after the buyer waves his rights to dispute the purchase,  or the arbiter intervenes. And buyers may want buyer protection for 21 days or longer, so your bitcoins would be tied up just well.
The only inherent advantage of bitcoin here is that the buyer protection would be optional, so if you trust the seller, you could  chose to settle the payment instantly.  But why would a buyer even want to do that?

AFAIK most desalination is done through reverse osmosis or direct solar energy.
Distilling water just isnt going to be cost efficient, even if your heat is a by-product.
There are more viable ways to make mining eco friendly, and they will rise spontaneously once asic sales margins drop to close to zero. Then mining costs will be dominated by energy, rather than hardware depreciation, and it will make sense to mine part time with excess renewable energy during period of peak supply. At those times, energy cost is zero or even negative. Monetizing that is truly eco friendly, as it helps financing more renewable energy sources, and only uses the energy when there is no other demand for it.

I think its too early to say what bitcoins ultimate usecase will be. Or should be.  Not too mention, CAN be technically.
My best guess is that bitcoin will become a settlement base layer for almost anything else. Not just layer 2 payment solutions like LN, but even for other blockchains, including PoS blockchains that need some ultimate oracle or ability to save checkpoints for their own security. These other blockchains may end up better suited to pay pizza as those transactions wouldnt require all the security immutability etc of bitcoin onchain transactions.

Yes you will. Economies still need credit. You have capital, so you will lend it out. For a fee. But since the interest money is never created,  it has to come from someone else. And over time your piece of the pie will only grow.
people make the mistake of comparing bitcoin with gold when that was used as money, without realizing gold has always been inflationary, through mining and conquests. That may roughly have kept pace with population and economic growth, but the supply was never fixed. 
A better comparison is the feudal system where wealth was primarily stored in land. Colonization aside, you cant just create more land, land supply is fixed; the result was an incredible and pretty permanent concentration of wealth, with little to no mobility between have's and have nots. If you where born in a rich family, you, your kids and grand kids would die rich, without lifting a finger. If you where born in a poor family, same story.

When every asteroid doubles the gold supply, it will be worth it until gold price equals the cost of a single deorbit mission. Which is probably in the hundreds of millions, maybe billions. Compared to todays trillions. Besides, these asteroids contains lot of other valuable materials, the gold could just be there by accident, eg when you are going for a platinum rich asteroid.


These metals are valuable for industrial use, even when they are no longer useful to store wealth. Just like aluminium is valuable, you just dont buy it to put in your safe.
@_date: 2019-05-24 12:12:12


Because it doesnt change anything about the fact some people have money and everyone else will need money. And money costs money. If anything, it makes the problem bigger because fixed supply will inevitably lead to higher concentration of wealth.
Ignore personal credit for a second. Businesses need credit to grow, to start up, to build factories to finance inventory. Your solution is: they first should save for it, but that is just dumb, a waste of potential and further solidifying existing wealth distribution where large companies have reserves and means to invest, small companies cant and have no access to affordable credit.  How do you expect small companies to grow and compete with large ones?
Same for individuals, if credit is not available, how do you expect a poor person to start a business and ever get out of poverty?  Ah just save! Right. Polish shoes for 50 years, and then maybe you can start that revolutionary internet company? 
You can not have an efficient economy without access to credit. And the only way that works without ending up in feudal system, is either high taxes or inflation or both. The notion that a significant portion of the population could be rich and stay rich without being productive at all, and somehow, this would not affect others is just as ridiculous as the idea that you can make everyone rich by printing money. The only thing that matters is the relative distribution of money, and how this correlates with their productivity. The better that correlation, the better your economy. Being rich and staying rich for generations because your ancestors accumulated a large portion of a fixed supply commodity, doesnt give you that. Neither does hyper inflation, but thats probably at least somewhat better, allowing everyone to start more or less on equal footing.

Not quite. Like many other prediction sites, they just measure current hashrate and assume that will remain constant. THe first day of a new difficulty interval it will show pretty much +0% and only the last day or so it will show a correct estimate. Inbetween it will be way too conservative if hashrate is moving quickly.
This one is far more accurate, even on day one its almost always at least in the ball park:
Bitcoinwatch now says 360M, bitcoinwisdom 417M. Im willing to bet the latter will be much closer to the truth. It also started its estimate at 405M whereas bitcoinwatch and most others like blockexplorer would have started at 265M.
FWIW, my personal guess since day 1 has been 450M and Im still sticking to that.

The thing to understand here, unless there is near universal consent, that even a simple blocksize increase means a hardfork. No different then when BCH forked, and did so with, lets say, "less than unanimous consent". So you split the blockchain and cause all kinds mayhem and confusion about what is the real bitcoin, you get the risks of replay attacks etc etc. This is why there has never been a planned hardfork of bitcoin. The protocol has remained backwards compatible with (in theory) even the first satoshi client, and all upgrades have been done through optional softforks.
So there is no plan;  and its going to be very hard to make a plan that gets near universal support because bitcoin has no leader and no one can force a plan up on it.  Unlike some other blockchains that hardfork every few months because they are highly centralized or have a Messiah that everyone follows.. Its not impossible and we could have some user activated softfork that triggers a hardfork when we get some percentage or whatever, but its not trivial and its clear today such a proposal would not gain a clear majority support.
BTW this inability of bitcoin to change its protocol, is if anything, its greatest strength. Its proof of its immutability and decentralization. If that means we can no longer use bitcoin to pay for pizza, or not until we get workable second layer solutions, then so be it.

Fun fact: current network speed is estimated at 1700TH. Even if by some miracle, not a single new KnC, Bitfury,  BFL, avalon or asicminer rig is deployed over the next 2 weeks, next difficulty would still climb to ~240M

What  has "ALREADY HAPPENED " has nothing to do with zero conf. I think it was about creating blocks with a certain checksum that they stuffed with bogus tx to make it match that checksum. There is no cost and no risk involved for a miner, and the pay off is not only guaranteed, its also a little more substantial than an average 1% discount on his pizza.
To pull off a double spend as a miner requires withholding a block. And that implies two things:
\- first, you put 12.5+ BTC at risk as someone else may beat your withheld block and if you dont have a majority of the hash rate, you will never catch up. 12.5 BTC for a free pizza is something we havent seen in quite some time. More over, since pizza's are rarely delivered within 10 minutes, your scam will be discovered before you even get your pizza.
\- You can only pull off the scam immediately after finding a block. You dont know when you are going to find a block, so you may die from starvation before you can even attempt your free pizza scam.
It makes no sense.

Its very difficult to predict difficulty in january 2014. It will depend entirely on the ability of all those new (and old) asic vendors to deliver on their promises. 
BUt here is the fun part: it doesnt really matter if they deliver or not. Either they do deliver the 10+PH they already presold and promised for  December, and those preorders will be worthless due to the difficulty, or they dont deliver anything like they promised, and you end up with the BFL scenario of waiting 6 or 12 months for your hardware. Neither scenario  gives you a good return.
The only scenario were any of these products could be profitable, is if your vendor delivers your order mostly on time, while all the others are delayed. Statistically, thats a stupid bet.
So I didnt check your math, but the conclusion is the same: dont buy.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:23:35
Indeed, but thats tied to the scaling problem it will help solve.
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:08:26
Miner protection program is misnomer for an even less profitable preordering scheme. Sure, you "only" pay ~1/4 of the price per GH compared to the original order, but its delivered at the earliest 3 months later (and without any promise when it will be delivered). The network is more than doubling per month, it doesnt take advanced math to figure out that as long as that continues, paying 25% per GH for something that will yield only 12.5% per GH isnt an improvement. Its digging a deeper hole for yourself.

Honestly, I dont find it that impressive. Many sites accept 0 conf payments using bitpay and the like, and thats actually even faster than what you are showing. I know 0 conf has its limitations (but its good enough for physical goods that need to be shipped out, and thus requires hours or days anyway) and of course, onchain scaling has pretty significant limitations; but its the potential to break through these limitations that makes LN impressive to me. Not so much its speed.
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:53:38
Its usually irrelevant. If I buy some goods online, and payment shows as accepted the moment my tx hits the blockchain (with high enough fees, no RBF flag), but the seller will take hours or days to prepare and ship my goods, he actually will have plenty of confirmations before he takes a financial risk, and to me it looks no different than a LN transaction, its also instant. 
And even when the physical transaction is faster, like the home delivered food I order at least once a week and pay for with bitcoin, the risk that I would double spend a $25 pizza order is so remote, no sane merchant would care (its not even his risk, as he just gets fiat from bitpay). 
0 conf is obviously not "the solution" to bitcoins scaling or latency, but its perfectly acceptable for many use cases.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:57:07
Yeah bitcoin is clearly superior. Instead of losing that much value in 80 years, it can do that in 1 year :)
@_date: 2013-10-06 12:41:22
Actually I value their assets at close to IPO price. They didnt tape out either asic, so their production cost is about zero; they paid their main engineer all of 10BTC, and they probably paid TheSeven not much more than a similar token. so what could they have spent their money on? They still have it, thats not what investors should be worried about it.
What they should worry about is the likelyhood of scammers that lied about everything paying back honestly their loot.
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:15:16
You make some weird assumptions. Why would anyone turn off a mining rig that still earns more than it costs to run? Mining doesnt take any effort or time, and especially in winter, at least you would get "free" electrical heating even if it would consume far more than it would earn.  And when a miner will finally get to the point where its no longer operationally profitable, he will sell his miner to someone else, who has cheaper or "free" electricity. Besides, with current 28nm asics thats not gonna happen until difficulty is 10 billion or so, and any hopes of breaking even on an order placed today have long vanished.
@_date: 2013-10-06 13:33:02
Pretty decent reporting tbh.
@_date: 2013-10-06 14:56:37
From now on, yes, but it used to be different. We used to mine with equipment which price wasnt affected by bitcoin difficulty. GPU's and CPU's were priced for other applications, and therefore sold at a price that would seem a steal for a bitcoin miner. During that time, bitcoin mining was quite profitable for most as network difficulty continually lagged behind mining profitability.
But now we have a bitcoin specific asics which are sold solely for mining since they have no other purpose, and hence the price is determined solely by perceived future mining profits. Thats what makes this era completely different.
@_date: 2013-10-06 10:12:45
Its not like mining is difficult, or labor intensive, just plug the machine in. So who would sell this hardware for a price thats less than what it would most likely yield in mining profits?  Especially if you can do both, sell the first machines at the highest bidders, then mine with hardware at production cost.
Its pretty obvious none of these miners are likely to produce a positive ROI.  Asic vendors would be crazy to sell them at prices that would.
@_date: 2013-10-06 14:52:37
There is not even a need to deliberately delay and self mine.That may or may not happen, it doesnt change the overall picture. Even if asic companies are honest and ship as promised, miners stupid enough to buy them will still end up with a loss.
As for comparable economic models. The closest thing I can think off is a dollar auction. Its not much of a comparison except for the conclusion that the only way to avoid losing money is not to bid.
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:20:46

Very cool. I would only suggest instead of using hashrate, that you use difficulty. There can be no ambiguity then, hashrate is always a guestimate.
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:03:21
And how do you expect to buy mining equipment with dollars, without giving out your name, address and credit card information?
IF for some reason you cant or dont want to use a bitcoin exchange, you can still buy bitcoins using localbitcoins with cash, bank transfer, moneygram, western union or whatever the heck you want.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:22:51
Easy to calculate. Difficulty =~140x network hashrate in GH. 
10 PH would mean difficulty of 1.4 billion

First 7 minutes are well worth watching too.
@_date: 2013-10-06 10:24:50
Its surprising its not closer to zero yet. A labcoin share is worth no more than what you expect these scammers to refund you, divided by the number of shares. 
How much will they pay out? Quite likely zero, but Im willing to believe they will pay out 100BTC or so when closing shop, hoping to avoid legal action and claiming they tried but failed and reimburse "whats left". 100 BTC / 10000000 shares = 0.00001. Thats about the maximum price I could see as a reasonable but risky investment.
The current price implies an expectation labcoin will refund 1200 BTC. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:03:23
I do think it's likely miners will be selling less, because selling locks in the losses, whereas holding at least they might still have a chance to make a dollar denominated profit. But miners is only a fairly small percentage of the market, so I don't think it Wil make a big difference.
@_date: 2013-10-06 09:23:52
You should rejoice. If anything, 190M is a tad lower than most people would have expected. You have KnC's delay and slow shipping to thank for that. Even so, did you expect this chart:
to suddenly flatten? And would you expect that to happen in the months that those first 28nm chips are coming online? 
Save your tears for December and January.
@_date: 2013-10-06 09:40:15


Thats incorrect. Firstly you assume there is such a thing as "would be miners", people who are torn between buying hardware and buying coins and will do one or the other with a fixed amount of dollars, no matter expected profitability. Im not convinced this is the case. 
More importantly, even if this is true, you ignore the fact that difficulty/price  already is a result of those "would be miners" investing their money. They cant spend the same dollars twice. The fact miners have preordered tens of millions of dollars worth of mining hardware thats not yet delivered, is not exactly a good a argument to predict a price increase due to those same people hoarding coins as well. You seem to think an increase in difficulty (caused by miners investing) will also cause them to spend even more on bitcoins because they pushed up difficulty. Thats a double spend :)
If anything, miners overbought and will be losing dollars/bitcoins and have less money available to buy bitcoins. That profit went to asic providers, and its far from obvious they will hoard coins. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 08:27:37
Current (well, upcoming) 28nm asics are geared primarily towards performance per $, not so much performance per watt, since right now electricity cost is still pretty marginal for asics. 
That will change. Already bitmine.ch claims in "low power" mode, its chip  will achieves 0.35W/GH (2800MH/W)
So you are looking closer to an exahash at todays BTC exchange rate.
Of course hardware isnt free, so in reality it will be lower.  See here for some estimates and a spreadsheet to calculate the endgame:
@_date: 2013-10-06 17:45:47
yeah but Im looking for a chart that showed % increase for each difficulty change, not those sipa (always off-the-chart) charts ,)
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:01:08
No one has, and no one will receive any before december or january. And before ordering, Id urge you to read a bit, its extremely unlikely you will even come close to break even. There is a shitload of asics thats promised to be delivered over the next few months, could be as much as 10PH. Miners will either get screwed because all that hardwares does get delivered on time (causing difficulty to go ballistic), or they get screwed BFL style because they dont get delivered.  Pick your poison.
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:04:49
Indeed, its striking how precisely if follows its exponential growth curve, and that despite the fact almost all of this hashing power is achieved with "old" designs that have been around for a while (I dont think KnC's recent shipments have contributed significantly yet).
One way of explaining this, is reinvesting. If on average, all miners reinvest all their mining revenue in to new hardware, and the hardware is priced according to difficulty (ie, perceived profitability), this is pretty much what you'd expect to happen and continue to happen until mining revenue approaches marginal production costs.
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:43:57
Because that site just parses dot-bit and adds a chart from sipa and a banner ad for its own profit:

@_date: 2013-10-06 09:00:04


Nonsense. You always had to fight for it, and always will. Mining is a zero sum game, difficulty changes nothing, it only ensures mining remains a zero sum game.


No offense, but thats more nonsense. Reward halving slows the inflation, but its still inflation. Every block thats mined theoretically decreases the value of bitcoins, unless that inflation already priced in. And guess what, since bitcoin inflation is perfectly predictable, it already is priced in. The previous reward halving did nothing to the price, and neither will the next ones.
@_date: 2013-10-06 08:27:48
Then you are better off reselling the freebies too. Of course there is a catch; market price for these miners will plummet (is already plummeting) , if you cant resell them fast enough you risk holding a big bag full of useless USB miners.
@_date: 2013-10-06 08:05:07


More like: "Howard ports an opensource fpga design to a 180nm process, its worthless, never even tapes out. Labcoin makes grandiose claims and posts fake pictures. Howard does some work on a 130nm implementation, it never even tapes out. Labcoin posts fake pictures, claims its hashing at 2TH and will be at 50TH soon".
You call that "communication problems"? LOL.


As it should.
@_date: 2013-10-06 07:41:03
Shocking. Well, not really. Pretty much exactly as I speculated on bitcointalk, except it seems they didnt even make the 180nm chips as I assumed.
The funny thing is that some people are still buying labcoin. After it has been made very clear they have no chips, no prospects of ever getting one, the people involved are clearly serial liars and associated with serial a scammer, somehow some people still seem to think this fable might have a happy ending.
@_date: 2013-10-06 08:23:00
You mean there is profit to be had even if difficulty has already jumped to 1.6B by then, and no one else but you buys those cointerra's in February (or future batches in march, april, june, .), and no vendor will reduce their prices to keep selling their hardware. 
Yeah, under those circumstances it might be profitable, but there isnt a snowball's chance in hell of that happening. Difficulty wont taper off before we approach at least ~10B. As long as its below that, producing those asics is cheaper than their potential mining revenue. These vendors will therefore produce, and either sell if they can still find enough delusional miners,  or self mine if they cant.
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:43:58
LOL, they havent even finished all 2012 orders. For little singles they are now shipping January orders, so still a 9+ month backlog. If you order anything today, dont expect it this year. You'd be lucky to get it next spring. Or as Josh calls it "in 2 to 4 weeks".
You can follow it here:
Note that those minirig orders dated october, they mean october 2012. You cant make up shit like that.
@_date: 2013-10-06 07:30:22
Even then it seems many miners dont mind a bitcoin denominated loss, as they speculate on a future bitcoin price increase and for some reason dont invest in bitcoins directly.
The only reason bitcoin mining used to be (very) profitable in the cpu, gpu and even FPGA era was because the chips needed for it werent priced in function of their mining potential, their were priced for a much larger market.  Bitcoin asics have no other market, and they are priced accordingly.  Only the vendors are fairly sure to make a profit.
@_date: 2013-10-14 08:30:44
We are already at 2.4 PH. Id expect hashfast and KnC alone to hit 5PH this year. Factor in the rest, and 10PH may not be out of reach this year.
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:28:31
It only goes back to 2012. We have seen far more dramatic percentual increases (up to the maximum of 400%) in the earlier days. I saw a nice graph of that somewhere, but I cant find it. 
@_date: 2013-10-05 20:57:16
If one is not profitable, 10, 100 or 1000 wont be profitable either. (in fact, theoretically they become even less profitable, as you increasingly start competing with yourself).
Basically right now there is no mining hardware you can buy that has a decent chance of paying for itself.
@_date: 2013-10-06 13:09:34
This difficulty increase wouldnt have surprised anyone, its basically perfectly following the curve from the past 6 months. If anything, its a tad below what I and many others would have expected if KnC were able to ship and deploy in time.
The real bitching will only begin in December I think, if KnC can get its act together and Hashfast delivers on its word. Add to that some new avalons, asicminers and continued shipping by BFL, Bitfury and the rest,... thats going to get really "ouch".

Can someone explain how they got or could get to sellers? Its clear that buyers could be identified, they would have to have given their addresses to the sellers, and if the FBI compromised or confiscated the server, they should have been able to read the messages and grab some customers.
But how could they possibly id a seller? Its not like they would be stupid enough to put a valid return address on the package...
@_date: 2013-10-06 17:41:48
You solved it yourself:


Of course it will get cheaper. Not just a bit, but orders of magnitude cheaper 
Those asics are very expensive to develop, easily millions of dollars, but cost a few dollar to produce (variable production cost); they are now sold as if they are made from pure gold.  I did the math on Fashfast's published specs, and the asic itself would cost ~$30-$40 per chip (400GH) for wafer, processing and packaging. Prices per GH will come down *tremendously*.
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:10:09
Then use bitpay. Zero worries or risk.
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:00:40


Im not saying anything different. Im saying the current asics will drop in price dramatically until we reach a point where marginal production cost approaches mining profitability. Depending on electricity costs and some other factors, thats at least somewhere around 100-200PH with current technology and using todays prices. I dont foresee anything else anytime soon, if ever, but 28nm still has legs and the chips themselves are cheap as, well, chips.
As for mining profitability, for miners its dead and not likely to ever return.
@_date: 2013-10-06 12:50:24


Its actually even worse than that, you cant completely ignore the possibility of a sharp BTC fluctuation, but if that happens, it will mostly work against miners. If you think about it, if BTC goes x10 next year, the difficulty will increase far further than predicted now,  to match that increase, assuming ASIC vendors can keep up. I admit thats a big assumption, but even if the price rise is only partially offset by increased asic deployments, as a miner you wouldnt profit from that price rise nearly as much as someone holding BTC would.
If OTOH, bitcoin price drops to 1/10th, few if any of those asics will be turned off, since they would still cost less to run in electricity than they generate. So miners will pretty much see their (dollar) revenue drop by a factor of 10x with nothing to ease the pain.
IOW, since current mining gear prices are based on (hugely optimistic) expected dollar profitability, if the BTC goes up, so will the difficulty, offsetting most the gain,  if it goes down by a lot, only your revenue will be impacted noticeably because all those sales are locked in.
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:58:33
Indeed, I forgot about that. Well if they actually deliver (/deploy), as well as KnC, avalon and BFL and Bitfury dont fall asleep, end of october could get pretty ugly for miners I guess. But given almost eveyone's trackrecord, I still think the real bloodbath will begin a bit later.
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:55:29
Possibly. But then miners who preordered will be screwed by late deliveries, BFL style.  
Also keep in mind these 28nm asic's pack almost 10x the hashing power of those older gens and it only takes 1 supplier to get supply chain right. I lost count of how many there are, about to start delivering. BFL, Avalon next gen, Asicminer next gen, KNC, HashFast, Bitmine, ActiveMiner, Cointerra, some HK company who's name I forget. Black dragon or something? Then there is bitfury.  I wouldnt count on all of them delivering on their promises, but would you bet on none of them getting their act together?
