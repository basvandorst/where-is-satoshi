I wonder if they offer an option to receive interest payment in USD instead of btc
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:34:27
Buy more now
@_date: 2019-07-19 08:24:09
Yeah ic...and being such a new company it hasn't been stress tested yet.  I wonder if a big exchange was hacked if they could be exposed to losses through a hacked exchange.  Maybe not worth the 6%

Old white men will never understand it because they subconsciously realise their moment of reckoning is coming.
@_date: 2019-07-27 00:10:54
Huge thanks for this.  Do you know if the Celsius network is a similar bus model or completely different to blockfi.  I want to hedge risk across two choices and was thinking blockfi and celsius
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:06:34
Let's look at the data...
1,000 hodlers since 2011 ALL 1,000 up 3,600,000%
1,000 traders since 2011, 900 zero account balance lost it all, 80 cashed out at breakeven, 15 up 50%, 3 up 100%, 2 up 500%
Good luck with your crystal ball method.

Lol I love bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:17:05
Yeah but what if you don't sell the btc interest payment...and then sell at a later date for capital gain or loss.  Is your cost base what you received it at or FIFO with other earlier purchases?  Seems like an accounting nightmare.  Maybe similar to a stock dividend reinvestment programs.
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:58:16
Another normal day.  Nothing to see here.
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:49:56
Wtf happened lol...after bitcoin I don't think I invest in anything normal ever again.  
I love when normal people say my house went up 3.8% last year
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:03:27
Expensive piss
@_date: 2019-07-20 09:00:33
Cool thanks I'll check them out as well.  
Might be a too risky for me though...if you think about it we are taking a highly risky volatile investment and now lending it out for % int for more gains on top of that.  And who would be insane enough to borrow btc given its volatility.  Could owe 3x your loan next month from what you borrowed.
@_date: 2019-07-20 08:12:29
Yeah I think the trick is to only invest less than 10% of coins in case you lose entire amount.  
I just checked out Celius network as well.  Simple app but again similar risks to blockfi.
Someone should create a simliar business staking w interest eco system in the blockchain for btc.  So that you still hold the keys somehow.

Not BCD...the diamond in the rough haha
Supposedly we all have some but pain in the ass to access it to sell
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:57:57
I thought this was good news.  The less wall streets meddles with btc the better off we are in the long run.
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:12:26
Fascinating..I've done detailed analysis and determined at this exact point in time there were more sellers than buyers
@_date: 2018-09-25 10:18:23
Hopefully this time they don't get forced to shut down
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:02:12

Im using it now!

Spot on

Dont throw the wrapper out it has the seed
@_date: 2018-08-18 18:04:22
its when everyone predicts it's going lower that it turns around and goes higher..like now
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:13:57
Nice work.. it's a sucker's game trying to time the market unless your the blue whale

Sent transactions for 1 sat this morning and confirmed in 35min
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:25:16
Probably a good guess though...seems to be a very very very large trader, saw these orders as well all day today.
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:14:05
Spot on...its old school thinking.  We got this amazing new technology and we keep trying to force it into the old systems like ETF, futures, visa cards, atms, centralized exchanges etc.
An ETF will get approved next year and then the year after will probably get hacked into, inside job, and then everyone will realise it was a bad idea.
Work on the technology not an etf
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:10:58
Bitcoin will succeed massively with or without their approval...its irrelevant in the long run
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:42:19
Come later this year everyone will be complaining again why wont the price just go down so I can buy some cheap coins kicking themselves for not buying in 6000s
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:47:52
Not completely true...it cost them alot of money to get this done though with accountants lawyers traders etc.
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:17:04
Yep nobody cares about ETF declines China bans all old news priced in.  
Op say something intelligent next time
@_date: 2018-05-10 18:10:04
Seriously wtf just happened?
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:46:56
No...bitcoin is new money dont force it into the old system.  
Pls get rid of futures as well, has done no gòod at all except provide an avenue for the elite to try and control it.
Also need to get rid of usdt as well which is another story.
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:51:39
Yep we have officially bottomed out.  
FUD news all week yet price unchanged.. sign of a trend reversal 
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:28:31
I had a Bitwala card like this but then they had bank issues and had to cancel it.
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:40:44
Hyped up futures market listing didn't help much...none of this stuff helps improve the technology.
Like aa said we are always trying to treat new money like old money and centralise it now under an ETF.  Bitcoin isn't meant to be centralized in an ETF with insurers etc.  Not your keys not your coins!
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:39:05
Congrats  hodlers we've made it.  Onwards and upwards from here. 
Buying a bit more for good measure
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:33:49
The low for the year will be $5800...climbing up slowly at first from here
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:40:45
Bears have given up...big short squeeze up to 7k again happening later.this week
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:39:08
Yep it's coming very soon...can feel it.
I think this week or next we will have a final capitulation where price is crashed down hard with a very quick recovery to 8k
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:42:31
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:12:44
Buying more now... gotta love these cheap prices.  
@_date: 2018-08-25 05:13:46
Who cares...
Can we ban the word ETF on here so tired of hearing about this crap.

It's a nasty tax law but true.  
Best to keep your long term holdings untouched and if you want to play around with swing trades use cfd or option trading instruments.  Never use the high leverage they offer
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:46:47

@_date: 2019-02-19 01:09:14
Memorized.  
Very easy to do.  Setup a room with 12 or 24 objects.  Each object should  make you remember the seed word.  
Walk around the room looking at each object and  recalling the word.  Do it 20 or 30 times till it's burned into your brain.  Remember the objects in the room.  Create a song in order about the objects in the room.  Wait one week, see if you can recall it.  Wait one month see if you can recall it.  Wait 4 months see if you can recall it.  Destroy all written copies.  Done
@_date: 2019-02-23 22:35:34
Nah man fall is over....It's.when everyone is predicting and waiting for this next fall when it will never happen.  Opposite direction to amateur retail sentiment and news.
@_date: 2019-02-20 08:28:24
Trading is for suckers who haven't learned about commissions and cgt tax.  If you believe an asset will continue to grow in value seldom buy and sell strategy will outperform someone who just holds forever.  
It's hard to believe this is true especially when you think your super smart and time a bottom correctly.  You must think long term.  Over the next 15 years how much commission and capital gain tax will erode the size of your  investment vs how amazing you are at inconsistently timing bottoms and tops.  
It's hard on the ego though, people want to build their ego and show how smart they are by timing the market.  Let's face it buy and hold forever is so boring.  If you could only train your bra8n to do the boring thing we'd all be millionaires.
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:49:49
Paying taxes erodes the amount of capital you have to reposition back in.  Also you need to time you tops and bottoms correctly consistently again and again.  So if you get it wrong you have a tax bill plus buy higher and in the end have less of position.  
If you just hodl forever or until you really need the money you'd be way better off.

Delisting of btc futures markets manipulating the price
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:32:06
Smart seller...would be a stupid buyer to use bitcoin now.  In 2020  could buy the house for 2.5 btc
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:36:30
Bitcoin will be a stable currency when it levels off near $100,000.  It will have a daily volatility ATR of $300 at this time and will have similar ATR as say EUR/USD market % wise. 
Most people won't  spend money their bitcoins, the machines they own will spend it automatically.  Bitcoin is not meant to be used at the local corner shop.  Its programmable money which machines will spend for us.

Government fiat is failing and will continue to fail.  They will forever continue easing to create stock market bubbles that will one day implode when every realises the true value of the usd is zero.
@_date: 2018-12-27 10:20:43
Futures trading killed bitcoins price.  
Easy for banks this year to control the price now pushing around paper bets same thing they did with the gold price.  Never own the gold or bitcoin physical but control the price via massive derivative bets.

It's a pain when you switch phones if you have a lot of Google auth accounts.  
Yes you can store all those Google codes but then that's another issue where do you store those and is it safe to store those electronically or only offline
