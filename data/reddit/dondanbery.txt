First, there is no house.. Wtf are you talkin' about? It's decentralised. Buying when it's cheap is the exact reason why Warren Buffet became a fucking billionaire, and that's what any wise investor knows, can you argue with that?

That's right, "cash isn't used for illegal activities" right? ��

I think you didn't get the joke ��

I think it's too soon to be sure about 1m, but once Bakkt futures launches, its safe to make the bet on 100k+ within 2y. By the way, test phase is tomorrow, get ready :)
@_date: 2019-07-21 20:47:28
Well you haven't heard about what Bakkt is about to do.. The 100k is very close from now because of that

Pretty good for mass adoption

Yeah, some people don't know the fuck they are talking about. This is sad.

Actually, you're wrong :
If you pay attention, you'll see that what took time (yet only few secs) was the selection of the type of coffee &amp; getting back to portrait mode. 
Once the person clicked on the "pay" button, it was INSTANTLY taken care of. Seems way faster than an nfc card confirming a transaction w/ classic payment processor imo!

I'd sell for USDC and wait it drops ~50%/60% to rebuy and then hodl until 150k

Secure your funds.
 
Don't forget that your private key/seed/password mean ownership.
Continue to invest amounts you can afford, on a regular basis regardless of the price. That's DCA, and it's a clever approach. Buy dips when u can. 
Never panic when price swings! 
The timing is good, most people think the next 2 years are gonna be great for bitcoin. I think it's true because the past behavior of BTC  before and next to halvings seems to repeat itself, based on the small historical data we have.
The more you learn about bitcoin, the more you should teach people about it.

"Negative yielding debt is twice the value of all gold ever mined, and 115x the value of the entire bitcoin network.
That's a $17T bubble people bought into knowing they are guaranteed to lose money unless they sell it to a greater fool. 
The definition of a ponzi scheme."

According to the BBC, Norfolk police traced and seized £275,000 (USD $339K) worth of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, under Gunton’s control&gt;
Seized? How did they do that?
@_date: 2019-10-16 07:46:42
I really like the fact that there are more Bitcoin ATMs installed nowadays. Specially at airports, makes sense.
Even if it's great for adoption, the fees are too damn high for most of the people who want to try. 
&amp; I think it's too bad cause it also means that there's a risk they either abandon the idea of purchasing btc, or will choose to use their credit cards to buy some, which is not the best alternative for privacy reasons.
Trading cash or goods for bitcoins is imo the best choice. Anything that allows people to get btc while not having to deal with the KYC hassle &amp;/or traceable transactions, is great stuff that fulfills its purposes &amp; empowers people indirectly.

Great initiative! Tested it, looks pretty decent !
Just copied/pasted features for the lazy asses:
• Liquid support: Create a multisignature wallet now also on Liquid. Move Liquid Bitcoin and Issued Assets to and from exchanges in 2 minutes with finality. Trade seamlessly, and own your Bitcoin.
• Unmatched Security: Our innovative multisignature model uses dual private keys - one held by the user, and one by our servers. This allows us to enforce Two-Factor Authentication to protect your funds, while timelock smart contracts guarantee that users always retain full control of their coins.
• Hardware Wallet Support: Full integration with Trezor One and Ledger Nano S gets you the best of both worlds: cold storage of your private keys combined with Green’s full suite of features and multisignature security.
• Fee control: Transaction costs can be kept low with SegWit support and customizable fees. In times of high traffic, urgent transactions can be pushed through with replace-by-fee.
• Privacy: No documents, personal information, or KYC required.  An email address is needed for wallet recovery purposes only. Connections over Tor also supported.
• Two-Factor thresholds: Make it easier to spend small amounts by setting a Two-Factor threshold. Total payments up to the threshold can be completed without 2FA.
• Connect to your own node: Minimize trust by specifying a full node for SPV.
• Watch-only wallets: Keep an eye on your bitcoin balances while on the go, and receive payments from others, without needing to grant payment permissions to your device.

You might have not enough storage.. Blockchain is a very heavy file and based on your SD card capacity it could just fuck the process up
Also forwarding port 8333 might fail if not synced right after

Well imagine that Bezos, Gates, Buffett and some other guys on Forbes list have lost all of their money cause they lost their key.. Game changer for wealth distribution statistically

The "hashrate crash" isn't real. Long block intervals are vastly overrepresented in fixed-period sampling 
This is because the interval is long. A 18-minute block has approximately the same likelihood as a 2-minute block, but affects time-based sampling 9x more.

Absolutely. Now that i use Binance, i use their "anti-phishing code". Once you have set your anti-phishing code, all legitimate Binance emails that you receive will contain this exact code. That's a cool feature.

Yes lost private keys are certainly a big part of the dormant adresses. Some are dormant since 2011...

It's not a known measure, Poisson distribution of blocks sometimes causes variance in block intervals. If several slow blocks happen in a row, it makes estimates spike down.
