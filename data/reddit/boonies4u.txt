The difference is that the barrier to entry for bitcoin is much less than that of stocks, bonds, CDs, etc. Why do you say it is at the expense of others? No one is forcing them to buy them (except maybe ransomware). Speculation of Bitcoin is much less damaging than speculation of state-backed currencies, mostly because goods/services aren't pegged at Bitcoin prices.


As I said above, the price per Bitcoin doesn't really effect those who simply wish to use Bitcoin to transact between currencies or simply pay for goods or services.

I wouldn't call it a right, but there's plenty of reasons as a State you would want to. It would keep the unemployed healthy/happy, so that if there's a sudden demand for jobs or there's a draft you aren't forced to choose between the healthy and employed or the unhealthy and unemployed.
It allows for a more flexible work force, that way that if the economy collapses, the quality of life will only drop so much for those who are unemployed for long period of time. If the economy booms and there's sudden demand for work the unemployed can take up positions, without a mass exodus from one industry to another.
I'm not arguing in favor/against welfare, but it does play roles in the first world today.

You won't be proud, but you won't be living out on the street doing what you have to do to survive, potentially causing greater harm to the economy than simply being sustained by the state.


That implies I was born into freedom. I wasn't and likely you weren't either.


The cost of living in first world countries often makes certain work prohibitive in a global economy. The cost of living could drop in the first world, but that would depend on the willingness of land owners and property owners to build or let people build low-income housing. (not state sponsored, just lower quality households)
Or they could simply squat... oh wait that would infringe on property rights.


It's a symptom of the global economy in general. It allows governments on the other end of the globe to devastate the local economy. The embrace of the free market may make the situation worse, not necessarily better.

Germany was split in two after WWII. West Germany certainly had better living standards, I admit. But, it wasn't simply a switch from Capitalist to Socialist. It was a switch from National Socialist to Soviet Socialist along with punitive measures against the German people.


The boom of the economy correlates with the quality of life increases, I agree. As their economy slows down I hope they are prepared regardless of whatever path they choose in the future.


 There's also the Three Gorges Dam.


Actually they've already collapsed/ are in collapse due to the dependence on the oil industry. Looting is common. This was due in part due to dependence on the oil industry. I believe it is important that people are educated on self-sustainability in any form of government, it doesn't matter if you get your food from a queue or a grocery store, you will starve or fight to survive.

@_date: 2016-08-22 00:16:59
I believe it is equally important to educate people on what to do when social programs/economic collapse as well as have plans in place at some government level on what to do if there is one.
Full dependence on the State or the economy (or one part of it) to survive will end badly. Venezuela is a good example.

Just because MtGox was centralized does not mean that acquiring bitcoins was centralized. Much like YouTube and FaceBook and Nico Nico douga are centralized, no one is being forced to use them.

It is turning it into an industry, it only leads to centralization assuming no new miners appear. Few people in the world work with bitcoin and even fewer know that they could become bitcoin miners. If you have evidence that no new miners are appearing, then I would believe that it is a concern.


What is stopping another company from producing chips cheaper and with greater amounts? Just because ASIC manufacturers are going to be mining does not mean that there will be one massive mining-corp.
If anything I think that as miners will be using their own hardware the centralization of hardware will lessen.

It still incurs cost, and in the end someone has to pay for it. That is what I meant by "no free lunch". 
Just because an organization are not-for-profit or non-profit, does not mean that costs are not incurred. Your credit union offers refunds, like you said, the money for those refunds come from elsewhere, likely from interest from loans.

Bitcoin is in the hands of miners. They point their power to pools that will use the mining power to their own benefit. When a pool operator and the pool's policies are seen as a threat to the miner, they no longer use that pool.
When I mined I saw my machine(s) as a # of Gh/s that I could point to the pool that I believed was creating blocks I believed in.

Just because we may never live without fiat does not make it a pump and dump.  As long as you earn an income in a country that requires you to pay taxes in fiat you will have to purchase fiat. Not everyone agrees on "what we want", fyi. Because bitcoin is valuable you have to do something for someone else in order to get it.
Are you concerned about bitcoin because traders are making money from it? Every resource on the planet is open to speculation, which affects the prices of goods and services. Bitcoin is no different. My advice to you is that you use bitcoin to learn how to use it and and ways where it can save you money or do things that fiat cannot, that way you AND the traders benefit.
Edit: some people believe that bitcoin (the currency) will be mostly used by institutions to streamline the transfer of value and that end users won't actually (need to) know that bitcoin is powering the financial tools they are using. How this may affect the price of bitcoin is unknown atm.
There's also the belief that the use of sidechains (essentially bitcoin turned into a special currency that can represent something else) may outpace and be more valuable than vanilla bitcoin. 
There's so many things to do with/on top of bitcoin that no matter what happens I think it will be used long after we died.

Small blocks will eventually force those with a small amount of bitcoins off of the main chain. I don't want to disenfranchise the poorest of our community. Do we want to pander to the wealthy and the banked, or do we want to allow the unbanked and poor to publish transactions as well?

We expect transaction fees to raise over time. 3600 bitcoins get produced each day. That is 1.2 million dollars worth. I can see why you are concerned.
Miners would have to accept transactions fees users can afford. Since the block reward would have dropped significantly (assuming price doesn't climb), they won't have any choice but to lower minimum transaction fees since it would be their only source of income.
You do realize that transactions can include multiple inputs and outputs? This is what allows bitcoin fountain and dice sites to operate as cheaply as possible. In the future, I expect the mojority of bitcoin movement across the blockchain to be done by wallets like Coinbase and Blockchain.info. They won't be looking to pay anymore than needed for transactions and pooling inputs and outputs together is a good way of doing so.
It's a flaw to think that one transaction means one person sent money and one person received it. It could be one person moving his own money around, or it could be multiple bills/debts being settled at once.

To purchase many different kinds of products in bitcoin I have to pay someone like Bitpay, Coinbase, etc in bitcoin to then pay a merchant in USD to receive my product. I know these companies allow merchants to receive some/all of the purchase in bitcoin; I don't think we have the numbers to know what volume this actually is. When the bitcoin accepting businesses are inclined to receive less Fiat, we will then know that they are comfortable believing that they can purchase everything they need to maintain the business and possibly pay employees.

For those of you who don't know... the Bitcoincard is a short-range radio transmitter/receiver that also functions as a bitcoin wallet. IIRC it allows you to send transactions, receive transactions pertinent to your wallet, and sign messages.

It's great for permanently storing data for the world to see... but even I think this is unnecessary. I don't think blockchain bloating is a big concern and am against censorship methods, such as though by to block "data" transactions.
Because mining will not go away, the blockchain is open to the world to use as they wish. It is up to miners to decide what transactions to include and what a fair price is for such tansactions.
If you don't want to include dice txns mine with Eligius. When we start censoring bitcoin protocol wide to only be used for transferring money, we limit its short-term  potential. If a utility becomes popular and perhaps devs have funding and users are willing to put hashes specifically into it, it should be moved onto its own chain.
It may be convenient for the dev to implement this in the blockchain rather than one he creates, which might not be as secure given low hashing power.

This is a legitimate concern. Though it is blown out of proportion. The nature of the protocol and that a hard fork is required to change it protects the users.


I haven't seen any numbers that suggest that maintaining full nodes will be prohibitively expensive for the middle class. There have been discussions on how to incentivize running a full node, and I believe this is where alternatives to POW may shine.


This is the nature of a publicly traded asset. This is why merchants may not want to hold onto bitcoin an why companies like Bitpay are able to charge money to transfer it for them. We believe that as the volume an depth of market trades increase, it will stabilize. Several notable people in the bitcoin community as a whole warn people that bitcoin is still an risky investment. However there is still money to be made improving the protocol and building "killer apps" and services around it that should further stabilize prices.


The same can be said about other assets. Gold has had quite the history in the US. Companies like BitPay, Coinbase, and the Bitcoin Foundation (shudders) have been lobbying to promote common sense regulation of bitcoin in the US. I would personally like to see the Bitcoin Foundation replaced with a decentralized system. I believe a bounty has been placed to create said system.
Sadly, the most repressive and protectionist regimes will likely put up the most barriers for bitcoin, which limits the amount of uses it has in those areas.


Elaborate? What data are you talking about?


There isn't consumer protection against fraud and theft built in Fiat systems either. Bitcoin =/= PayPal. I believe that concerns about fraud and theft are the concerns of the courts and not the money itself.

Bitcoin isn't deflationary, it inflates at a predictable and limited amount.

It isn't 21 Million units. It is 2.1 Quadrillion. It is theoretically divisible beyond that.


No, but they have to go through bureaucracy.


Yes, and there wasn't an overnight price change or difficulty change when the reward halved for the first time


Yes, they are making bank. They could do this much cheaper, but they won't, because Bitcoin remittances have yet to reach the threshold to compete with them. Bitcoin remittance companies only need to cost marginally lower than Fiat remittances.


Correct, you may not have transaction fees imposed on you. However you (your savings) is being diluted by the constant inflating of your currency. We have to deal with this in bitcoin, but our inflation rates are predictable and will not continue ad nauseam. Banks also profit providing credit and investing deposited funds.

So would you rather Bitcoin be mined until the end of time, like Fiat?
Uncompetitive? How so? When the number of bitcoins mined each day drops extremely low, miners will be forced to compete with eachother even more to fight over transaction feed. Miners that cannot compete with either power or ability to require lowers feeds than competition will have to quit. This will drive the difficulty down, allowing for the remaining miners to get a better piece of the pie.
Bitcoin difficulty is scaleable for a reason. There is no difficulty floor that needs to be maintained in order to keep bitcoin stable. Bitcoin will allow for money to more seamlessly move across the globe, because it doesn't involve greasing it up as many times along the way as fiat through remittance companies.
Not everything has to be paid for nowadays. With the legacy system(s) you are paying for more than you think.

There is always the possibility of a hard fork. Banks can offer cheap transactions, because they are the ones who control your transactions. My banks tries to sell me their other products, which make them money, so they can continue to be convenient/cheap to people who don't use their premium financial products.
It's like freemium games.
edit: Bitpay runs under a similar scheme.


If they do recognize it, they will lower their prices. If they don't, they will lose business which will be picked up by Bitcoin Remittances. Either way the consumer wins.


As I said before, if they can can compete, great. If all Bitcoin does is create new methods of transferring money, internationally and locally, that force businesses to have to compete with new money. Great.
Bitcoin IMO uplifts the lowest common denominator, by allowing them more options. Bitcoin due to its nature cannot be stifled like other systems that tried to change the status quo.

I could see it happening if the network screeches to a hault due to the inability to afford transaction fees. This is a highly what-if scenario that will likely be visited in the future. If you have concerns about it, I advise promoting/developing whatever solutions/alternatives you believe will help alleviate this.


Not much more I can say other than I disagree. I believe that people are vested enough into Bitcoin for it to survive long term.


Retail isn't the end-all be-all of Bitcoin. I believe Bitcoin wasn't created to necessitate the removal of third parties or trust. I believe it was created to streamline the movement of money, while allowing people to control their money without the need of trust if that is what they so desired.

It would be nice to snag a TV or furniture at great discounts.

When there is a usage spike or DDOS  a big queue of transactions can form. Those who don't mind waiting will likely wait for the backlog to be taken care of, while those who can't afford to wait can bump their fees so their transactions are more likely to be included in the next block.
I don't think we are ready for this fee market, so I hope we get a max blocksize increase sooner rather than later.
Edit : in the next block, not I the next block
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:42:27
I believe that it is up to the mining pools and individual nodes to deem whether a legal (does not break any rules) transaction should *not* be relayed or included in a block. Limiting the maximum blocksize network wide in order to limit these types of transactions is essentially punishing the entire network.

This is also assuming that the price increase would only be caused by an increase in the buying volume at/approaching 1000$. The waning of selling volume between 200$-1000$ would lower the amount of capital needed to bring it back up to 1000$, correct?
Also, less people shorting bitcoin should also make the climb back up less capital-intensive, right?

I suppose we would have to see what chain(s) survived the hardfork. If they both survived, the distinction would be need to be made between the two. If they both survive, I don't think the name "Bitcoin" should refer to either network. In terms of conversation, promotion, and documentation things would get quite confusing.
The transactions would be easily distinguishable and would not result in the destruction of token on either chain.
So long as sending coins on one chain does not impact the ability to send them on the other, I don't see any side losing more than the other.

In all honesty, I think if Classic gets there fork, the only way to protect Bitcoin Core's 1MB chain is by switching it to another Proof Of Work. If there are still enough people that would be interested in using the 1MB chain, that would be the best way to do it. Otherwise, there would be a lot more hashpower on the other chain that could attack it. Doing this preemptively though would be insane.

Yes, hopefully those wallets won't need to have opt-in RBF as a default. If blocks get filled on a regular basis, opt-in RBF is a very useful tool and I would expect every consumer wallet to have it available easily and possibly set as default.
If we can keep blocks from regularly filling up in the short term (scalability improvements including blocksize increases) we can have a much smoother transition into RBF transactions as the coinbase transaction ( 25 btc miner reward) drops.

@_date: 2016-01-20 22:15:45


Which is why it would be more effective if it came with an increase in MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:15:25
Let me explain and a few points to the end.
There is a finite max blocksize on the bitcoin network. Highways can only handle a finite amount of vehicles entering it at any given time.
When these systems reach their peak capactities, a backlog forms. There are ways around this and ways to bundle transactions/commuters that change how people go about performing a transaction or getting to work.


I won't know exactly when I need to perform a transaction. I might need to do so during peak usage, and it working fast the rest of the time is no consolation.
If I create a transaction during peak usage, I have two options.
I can wait longer for my transaction to be confirmed, which is inconveniencing and affects me. This is comparable to getting on the highway as soon as possible and waiting through the backlog of vehicles which inconveniences me and affects me
I can pay a higher fee so my transaction is confirmed as if there wasn't a backlog, which inconveniences me and affects me. This is comparable to taking a toll road, passing through a given number of tolls, and then hopping onto the highway at the last possible exit, this inconveniences me and affects me.
No matter which choice I make, I am spending either more money or more time. This is what affects me.
Now those points I promised. No matter which choice I make, there will still be peak usage periods, since all transactions need to be reflected on the blockchain at some point. Limiting the max blocksize *unnecessarily* does nothing more than increase the need of more people to spend more money on transactions.
The traffic analogy only falls apart when RBF is involved and I did not see you mention it specifically, only that increasing fees helps transactions get confirmed faster.
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:11:09

@_date: 2016-01-23 06:47:50


Yes we have. Multiple times.


Paying more fees does not reduce the mempool. It is not a scaling solution... it's just a way of showing how fast people want their transactions confirmed.
Imagine being told that there is a really cool party going on and anyone can get in line to go in, but only so many people are allowed in every 10 minutes. Then people start to notice that the line is getting really long (like a 100+ minute wait) more often. Then some guy comes up to you and says, hey the line isn't at over capacity, you can just pay more money to cut in line.

Let's assume the bitcoin ecosystem (those saying "I want a bigger block size now!") believes that an increase to a 2MB MAX_BLOCK_SIZE has a negligible effect on decentralization, why would they choose to wait for SegWit, Lightning, IBLTs, and Weak Blocks?
One implementation could begin in one month while we won't see SegWit released until April.

So you are concerned that the discussion of a proposal to *steal* bitcoins would gain popular support someday? Interesting.
Like many others I'm not concerned about miners acting in their worst interest. If bitcoin were to be contentiously forked, the miners would be acting in their best interest. A successful contentious hard fork would leave the unforked chain to die or at least vastly weakened by the dwarfed hashing power. Bitcoin Core may very well be abandoned by the miners, but not at the cost of hashing power becoming worthless.

I was referring to this [roadmap]( The link to which can be found [here](


be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.
I'm seeing nothing that suggests a "moderate block size increase" in April 2016, only that an increase may be less controversial in the future. What roadmap are you referring to?

Assuming that they could accept eachother's transactions and blocks, then they would be the same currency, just using different software. Core's mined blocks and created transactions would look a little different than Classic's though, but as long as the blocks and transactions were compatible there would be no more problem.
It seems that Core will decide whether or not they will be relevant or not, by accepting or denying an increase to 2MB.

The merchant wallet isn't the one using RBF, it is the customer's wallet. The merchant wallet can only flag the transaction as opt-in RBF. Because bitcoin transactions are push, not pull there is nothing stopping a wallet from sending coins to any address that exists or could potentially exist. Both parties are stuck waiting for a confirmation. The only way a merchant has to refuse an opt-in RBF is by telling a customer beforehand or giving a refund after the fact.

So the average size of transactions determine the maximum blocksize? Would this mean that as the network gets congested and people are forced (by the fee market) to pool into larger transactions, that the max blocksize would grow in order to let people move bitcoin without bundling with others? and that when the size of transactions lowers that the max blocksize adjusts downwards?


Referring to mining pool operators?


No, but the blocksize could still be manipulated by those who are able to spam the blockchain until adjustments occur, while shifting the blocksize downwards or upwards.


I don't think that a fee market currently exists and that your proposition seems most appropriate when one does. It may also be abused or intended to force a fee market into existence... which would hopefully not be successful.

Were you saying that "No, capital controls are interfering with..." or "No, capital controls are not interfering with..."?
From wikipedia


Bitcoin in general allows anyone of any country move money freely to anyone anywhere in the world, in this case the winner. While the advised amount to send to winner is 1USD equivalent, the winner of one country is receiving a small fortune from people all over the globe... a single person who is in one country... which I believe to be if not in practice, but definitely the spirit of capital controls. (The movement of capital out of country)
They deserve attention more than you, because I have yet to see you present a project to reddit involving bitcoin... you also only submitted four posts here in 5 months and one post to 9 months ago. Congrats on setting up your mom a coinbase account though.

I've heard a few miners pumping the heat into their floors for radiant heating. It's really cool use of the waste heat.

@_date: 2016-02-24 04:10:49
I don't think anyone should have to pay 1$ to publish a normal transaction before we increase the MAX_BLOCKSIZE.
Every time theres is a halvening I realize that we are getting closer and closer to the point that miners will have to depend on fees in order to operate. Every ~4 years they bring in half as much in new coins. They can always choose to include less than the MAX_BLOCKSIZE,  so I don't expect them to mine unprofitably.

Most people don't know that merchants pay Credit Card companies fees. Most businesses that accept Credit Card payments as well as cash charge the same price no matter the payment method.
Whether most businesses will bother accepting bitcoin before Lightning is another story if we hit full blocks, because the consumers will realize what fees they are actually paying.
I'm not dissing Credit Cards, much as I wouldn't diss bitcoin even if we don't Hard Fork. Bitcoin will still have use cases at any average fee rate, but I think it will stifle its growth.


That doesn't seem to invalidate the point I'm trying to make. Which is that certain people aren't interested in protecting certain use cases of bitcoin, due to various reasons. Either by kicking the can down the road, with eventual signifcant capacity increases, or having faith in a system down the road that will enable these uses on a different layer.


see 's post above


I can't foresee every possible negative effect of blocks being full, I was merely pointing out who would be affected by a 2.5x jump in average fees. It won't spell the end of bitcoin and without volume and transaction number statistics from BitPay and/or Coinbase, I won't be able to guage how many people this will actually be.
But by claiming that such an event would only last a "short while" means you either have great faith in Lightning or can predict the future. I'm not saying it would be bad that Bitcoin would have a surge in popularity... I'm just saying that we can take real action **now** to prepare the network for any unseen surges in popularity that may happen before Lightning is released.

I read them. I just thought that you might have something more to say other than "what the Core Devs said."
You do know what the halvening is... right? Did you even go through the last one? 12.5 bitcoins will be generated per block instead of 25. I am confident that the next few halvenings will create a healthy fee market whether or not the MAX_BLOCKSIZE is held at 1MB.
I don't mind paying more in fees because the miners need them, but I don't want to pay more in fees because people feel that the blockchain space should remain scarce.
Edit: fee market,  not free market
@_date: 2016-02-10 00:25:42


Citation needed. See what I said below. If you can provide the statistics on what people are actually using their bitcoin for, by all means go ahead.




I'm not disagreeing that discounts can outweigh transaction fees. But I cannot predict what transaction fees will look like once blocks are full, or even what transaction fees will look like during any spike in usage during a time frame of the day. RBF wouldn't be proposed if there wasn't a concern for stuck transactions, specifically because a surge in usage during a short time frame can cause an initial calculated "flat fee" to not be sufficient in getting a transaction confirmed in the senders acceptable time-frame.


You're putting words in my mouth. I did not say "they don't know or really care about anything? I said "Most people don't know that merchants pay Credit Card companies fees."
Shoppers are fickle and can be easily swayed. I think they bring significant value to network, specifically because we have to compete with existing infrastructure to keep them.
If you don't think that they are worth competing for or don't think they provide significant value to the system, fine. Agree to disagree.


They can use Bitcoin without permission. They can use Bitcoin without credit history. They can use Bitcoin without a security deposit. They can use Bitcoin without paying a flat fee upfront to acquire a charge card. They can use Bitcoin without having access to banks. They can use Bitcoin while under bankruptcy proceedings.
Many things can lead to someone wanting to use Bitcoin, whether through a personal crisis or other events they can't control, I want a healthy Bitcoin to be there for them. When these people can use the bitcoin they acquire without needing to cash out, they will be more likely to be sticky users.


I never said that. I stated that if we increase the blocksize now we can prepare for a surge in popularity. You extrapolated that I was equaiting a surge in popularity with mass market application.
Bitcoin has a small number of users and even doubling it wouldn't bring us anywhere close to the users of Credit Card companies, which is why a simple increase in MAX_BLOCKSIZE can be an effective measure at this time. It is not the end-all be-all and I'm excited for Lightning, I just don't think it's an excuse to not think about the interim.
@_date: 2016-02-24 05:26:16


I don't deal in absolutes.


The "first" miners, including Satoshi himself did not make any money. When I first heard about bitcoin it was priced at 2$ per coin. Between then and now the USD reward per block has shifted a great deal.
When the price of bitcoin spiked, people had an incentive to start mining with their older hardware. They were trying to mine as many new coins as possible before the difficulty adjusted.
Imagine in 12 years that the bitcoin price is 500$ and 1 BTC is created per block. There are roughly 144 blocks mined daily. This means that daily all the miners in the world are competing for 72000 USD compared to the 1.5 Million USD today. Imagine that up until that point that the ASICs were have now are still in working condition AND/OR new ones have been developed.
The only situation that I could see someone mining with a GPU when existing, more efficient, and powerful hardware exists is where there is a lot of money to be made in fees.
Anyway, you are right that miners will adjust, but not in the way you think. Miners will constantly react to the fiat value of the bitcoin reward per block, the total fees they can safely bring in per block, and the bitcoin difficulty. When there is suddenly less money to be made the least efficient drop out. When there is suddenly more money to be made more efficient miners can join.
@_date: 2016-02-24 04:03:15
I don't want a hard fork every single time the blocks max out. That doesn't mean I don't want the blocksize to increase over time as needed. The mining reward drops over time, so I don't expect the actual blocksizes to over inflate. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:44:42


I don't see how having more blockspace makes it harder for people to use it for settlement. I do see how having less blockspace makes it harder and harder for people to use it as a payment network.


Miners shutting down does not necessarily mean a drop in difficulty. If the remaining miners buy the old hardware and are still in the process of buying more/better hardware it might not drop.
I never said that fees would ever reach 25 BTC per block. I was just saying that after every halvening the fees that are paid make a greater percentage of what the miners bring in. Besides, miners pay bills and hardware priced in fiat currencies, so there's no way to know what 25 BTC is worth in 12 years or what an acceptable transaction fee is.
@_date: 2016-02-24 03:57:27
I didn't expect the blocksize to be limited network wide in order to create and maintain a fee market. I assumed that miners would have the final say in how big their blocks would be and what valid (profitable) transactions to include.
@_date: 2016-02-23 03:15:14
If you want miners to make more money, pay more fees. No one is stopping you.
I don't think that the MAX_BLOCKSIZE should be limited because people who can afford to pay higher and higher fees don't care how many people can use bitcoin. I want bitcoin... the actual blockchain to serve the poor and underbanked. I want the most good for the most people. I don't want a different kind of money for the richest people and organizations, while the rest are stuck with Bank 2.0^TM .

You're right about the manipulability... But one must still consider the cost of running these nodes. It still has its costs just as mining does. If this is a conscious attack there will be a falter in Classic nodes in the near future, i'd say before the end of the month. I've heard about the 'fake' XT nodes, but I didn't witness them while actively following like I am now.
I hope those running publicly visible nodes realize that it can be a useful voting tool when not abused . Maybe when/if nodes become more expensive to maintain due to a larger blocksize it will be a less dilutable metric.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:06:29


Bitcoin wasn't made to be a settlement system. Have you read the white paper?. It started out being valued at nothing and served no one. Every use case is new and I think all should be respected so long as they pay the fees miners find acceptable.
Bitcoin has been used for payments for many years now. The first time I heard about it being used for settlement is when this scalability debate began.
By "not changing anything" we are in fact sticking to a temporary measure that was put in place to protect the network from DoS attacks. This inadvertently or purposefully, depending on who you ask, will increase the cost per payment transaction.
@_date: 2016-02-21 04:17:10
I believe that this roundtable consensus is much closer to a compromise than core's roadmap. It actually shows a commitment to working on a hardfork and gives a timeline of when the code should be ready.
I would have preferred that the hardfork be prioritized before SegWit, but this is better than what I expected from Core, even though Core hasn't officially comitted to this consensus.

Fees currently make up roughly .5 BTC per block. Miners currently get 25 new BTC per block. As more and more halvenings begin the fees will make up a larger part of the BTC they bring in.
If the blocks are allowed to rise, the miners have more control over how they choose to bring in those fees. They can choose to bring in fewer high-fee transactions or more low-fee transactions. I assume the choices made will depend on what types of transactions are in more demand (settlement vs. payments) and the orphan risk.
Keeping block size low skews the network to favor settlement transactions.

I think the best metric is comparing the number of Classic nodes to Core    0.12.0 nodes. The numbers can be seen [here]( under user agents as /Classic:0.11.2/ and /Satoshi:0.12.0/ respectively.
As of posting this there are 894 classic nodes and 169 core 0.12.0 nodes.

It would protect the Core's blockchain from an attack by the ASIC farms, but it would also leave them without the protection offered by them.

Sorry if that came off trollish. I probably should have approached this better.
I should have instead highlighted that Classic is the latest release of code that supported bigger blocks. There are xt nodes and unlimited nodes that are also active and show support for bigger blocks. Classic has also claimed Open-RBF will not be included in their 0.12.0 equivalence,  and I'm also interested in how it will compare to core 0.12.0.
I consider the popularity of latest releases when considering the situation and I understand if it's seen as populist and accept the criticism I receive because of it.
I wonder if those who support Core but won't be running 0.12.0 think that it was the best use of time and resources to develop... same could be said with any/all releases down the line though, so I won't use it to make and arguments.

Those who are performing a purchase of a good or service of 10$ or less are suffering. To get a "fast confirmation" for a 10$ purchase a 0.10$ fee is 1% and a fee of 0.25$ is 2.5%. That jump sure is big for "ants". Those who wish to control their bitcoins have to publish transactions to make purchases, it doesn't matter how small of a purchase it is. This would make bitcoin much less attractive to those who would like to use it for Point of Sale purchases at corner stores, restaurants, and cafés...
The fee bump would have little direct impact on those who are making large (3 digit plus) USD purchases, those who buy and sell bitcoin in large amounts, and those using it for settlement purposes. If these people needed a fast confirmation, the fee would be a very small percentage of the volume. My bet would be that more often than not, they wouldn't be in much of a rush as the guy who is looking to buy a dozen donuts.
This is an attack on the "ants" by those who wish to deem what bitcoin Is and Is Not.
I'm actually tempted now to go out and seek those who use bitcoin for small purchases and those who would be interested using bitcoin what they would think of a 2.5x increase in transactions fees for a 10-minute confirmation. 


It's a great long-term solution. I'm sure it will be popular once it's finally released. Should those wishing to use bitcoin to purchase goods and services be hung out to dry until then? What if bitcoin has a surge in popularity and daily use increases? Should they have to deal with a fee market and told to wait for Lightning?
A blocksize increase can serve those who wish to use bitcoin now, and provide a cushion in case we need it until Lightning is ready.

It isn't at no cost to them. Larger blocks are more likely to be orphaned. If a miner's blocks gets orphaned that means they lose the mining reward and all transaction fees.
It's a calculated risk. Those who make the best decisions will outcompete the other miners. Having more hashing power =/= faster network propagation. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 04:29:50
I believe the miners are the ones who should choose their own blocksize. It is up to them if they would rather choose to include ten 5$ fee transactions or a hundred .50$ fees.
Miners wouldn't want to inflate a block with transactions unless they believe that including them is worth the risk of it orphaning.
Those who wish to use bitcoin as a settlement system will be able to afford publishing transactions whether or not I can afford to use it to buy coffee. It will be those wishing to use it for payments that will have to compete with the fees of others wishing to use it for payments. When/if there is little demand for bitcoin to be used for payments the amount of money miners can make by including these tramsactions will drop. This means block sizes will drop.
I think alternatives should develop naturally,  not be forced because people think that bitcoin has to br a settlement system right now.

The internet speeds vary greatly between countries considered to be "first world", due to poor infrastructure and monopolies. I think that a bitcoin with more popular control will not lead to a situation where the resource demand of running a bitcoin node becomes too much for "an average user". You and I will probably be dead before the bitcoin network can handle VISA level transactions, perhaps some layer on top of bitcoin can before we're dead though. If bitcoin is only a settlement system for the layer on top, it's the layer that is handling the transactions, not bitcoin.
If we have to go down a path that is objectively right, we must also know what is the right outcome and end goal for bitcoin. I wouldn't be surprised that bitcoin scaling to VISA levels is determined to be "wrong". We must determine what level of increase, decrease, or no change at all is right for bitcoin's various properties/metrics... The overall Transaction Cost (Mining Costs, Full Node Costs, and Transaction Fees), Decentralization of Miners and Nodes, Bandwidth Requirements, Rate of Inflation*, Avg. Time Between Blocks, etc.
I don't think that a "right" path is compatible with a populist end goal and vice-versa. Bitcoin can take a "right" path to a "right" end goal, but I have no idea what this would look like and who would use it. However, I can more easily grasp what a populist bitcoin would look like. (claims of everyone running a full node and reaching VISA level transactions)
I am more concerned with the former path, due to the power it bestows on those who determine the correct path and end goal. I am less concerned with the populist camp, because at least then we won't have to worry about dictators. 
Overall I'm scared for the future of bitcoin every single day. Not because I'm afraid that it will break, but because when the popular idea is right, those with seniority or merit will say it is wrong. When those with seniority or merit put forward that an idea is right, popular opinion will say it is wrong.
We can only hope that those with merit and seniority do what is right, much as we can only hope that popular opinion is right. Determining what is right from that start will only prove those who determined so wrong. No matter which path bitcoin takes, there's going to be some harsh realizations and hurdles either way. Bitcoin isn't magic and we can't have our cake and eat it to.

I don't support those who wish to hold the blockchain back in order to force these alternatives into development. It's like inflating gas prices to increase demand and research of alternatively fueled vehicles.

I wouldn't say that The Classic camp as a whole is only concerned with the present, but many bitcoiners have flocked to them because they wish there was a change to help the present situation.
If there is a successful hard-fork and Core continues developing for the largest chain I would not feel a moral need to boycott them and their software.
There are plenty of great people working on scaling improvements (both short and long-term) and additional applications of the Bitcoin blockchain. I don't believe the proposed hardfork will "fire" these developer.
Sorry, not all of this was directed at you, but the general atmosphere I've seen in the recent past.

Do you think the economic situation may reach a point that a hardfork is needed/wanted "across the entire Bitcoin community"
I'm glad that code for the hardfork code will be ready in 2016 and that it will be available to everyone in case that it is needed sooner.
I believe that the roundtable consensus is much closer to a compromise than the bitcoin core scaling roadmap. An expected time and commitment to working on a hardfork code for both a MAX_BLOCKSIZE increase and cleaning up of SegWit is something I've been waiting to be see.
@_date: 2016-02-21 16:48:05
I completely agree with maaku, this roundtable consensus really sucks. I just think it sucks less than the Core Roadmap.
I'd rather have the option of kicking down the road so we have the time to work on real scaling solutions.
This is what an ugly compromise looks like.


It's far easier to get online and discuss bitcoin on reddit than it is to drive downtown... (I drove two towns over) to go to a local bitcoin meetup. IMO the bitcoin users who actually bother represent an even smaller slice of bitcoiners.
I would say that merchants, payment processors, wallet developers, and exchanges interact with the most bitcoin users. Eventually every bitcoiner will interact with one of these parties at some point. It provides a good opportunity for actually polling the community as a whole.

Ross committed illegal acts to provide and secure a market for people to sell and buy illegal goods. Whether or not this promotes or lead to "the betterment of society" has been highly debated. However, his actions allowed people to buy and sell these goods in pseuedoanonymity at a great distance which greatly reduced chances of violence to acquire and sell such goods.

I was just saying that receiving bitcoins through Bitwage or Cashila would be buying bitcoin... was saying that it is better to work for bitcoin than buying it.
Receiving bitcoins directly from my employer would be good enough for me. That way my bank doesn't know my employer and my employer doesn't know my bank info. I use direct deposit and both Lawnmower, Bitwage, and Cashila would lead to even more people knowing my bank info.
I have ways to buy bitcoin without revealing my bank info to more parties. The parties above allow for me to slowly purchase bitcoin over time, without going out of my way each pay period to do so, while reducing my spending habits. Bitwage and Bitwalla give me a percentage based on how much I earn, Lawnmower gives me the change from purchases I make.

As I said in another reply, that is essentially the same thing as buying bitcoin. The amount of bitcoin I buy from Bitwage and Cashila would be based on how much I earn. The amount of bitcoin I buy from Lawnmower would be based on the change I receive from purchases I make.


Lawnmower isn't about acquiring large amounts of bitcoin. Acquiring bitcoin for me is not a competition. If I wanted to acquire  significant amounts of bitcoin it would not be through any of the above mentioned parties. I wouldn't even want my day job employer involved or my daily use bank account.

I'm not doing that at all. Why do you feel that I am doing that? *Don't* project your own biases on me.


You're making quite a few assumptions... the largest being that he maintained The Silk Road for its entire existence, which has already been questioned by the Ulbricht defense. He however was running The Silk Road at the time of his arrest, that much is certain.
/rant If he cared about his family's opinion of him he should have taken better measures to not get caught. I wouldn't expect anyone in his shoes to put their image in their relative's eyes above what they are trying to do. They aren't victims and they don't deserve my pity. I think the same of families of people who commit suicide. Unless I know you personally "I'm sorry for your loss" is nothing but politeness. /endrant


If he wasn't running it for-profit then what should he have done with the bitcoins? Do you think charities would accept the bitcoins if they found out where they came from? What do you think would happen to said charities (if they were in the United States) if the feds found out that they were accepting donations from a criminal enterprise?

Since the post you replied to was deleted, I doubt you'll get an answer, but I think I have a fair understanding of what he meant.
In capitalism, only the most productive for themselves get to live comfortably and securely... not the most moral, cooperative, or productive for society. People try to build their own towers while convincing/teaching their children how to ensure the wealth remains in their hands. While it is technically possible to reach the wealth of Donald Trump in one lifetime, capitalism by far helps those who inherit their money more than someone who is starting off by scratch.
To have government programs that actually help out those who start off poor are moral socialist handicaps, which are either seen as good (because they raise the living standards of the poor) or bad (because they are unfair competition).

When you perform a transaction using the default bitcoin client you are spending coins from the balance of your wallet, rather than specific addresses.

I was not suggesting that someone "determines if it was stolen" and then confiscate and return the stolen funds. I was just saying that someone who has their coins stolen may likely ask for information about who they received their stolen coins from. They would be entirely reliant on the compliance and willingness of the party who had received the stolen bitcoins down the line.
I am not trying to attack the fungibility of such stolen coins or suggesting that anyone do so.

No, I never suggested such things. Nor do I think you should ask for such things from parties you are purchasing bitcoin from.
I was merely pointing out that if bitcoins were stolen from me and sent to an address associated with someone, I would likely ask that person who they received the coin from (or what little they do know). 
I would not take this to the police as it would be impossible for me to prove that the coins were in fact stolen. I would be entirely reliant on the person's willingness to give me information on who they received the coin from.
I repeat I would not go to the police or any other body that would harass you or try to convince you that it is your duty/obligation to reveal who you do business with.

I understand why people would mine on BTCGuild for PPS, but they charge fees for PPLNS which I don't understand at all.

That sounds like robot talk...

Bitcoin is only as anonymous as you want it to be. You can even sign messages with your bitcoin address to claim that you own it.

Except bitcoin "mining" won't stop. Miners just will no longer receive new bitcoins, they will just split up the transaction fees. Transactions will still need to be confirmed.

Just because you don't want to use Dropbox because of PRISM doesn't mean that they shouldn't accept bitcoin for those who don't mind.

My best guess is that it is a player/browser issue that other are complaining about.

Isn't this just an edit of a past video?

Not only that, attempting a double spend on the kinds of transactions that BitPay accept with zero confirmations is uneconomical.

I haven't had JWs ring my doorbell. Though I have been quite hospitable to Mormons. I even received a Book of Mormon from them and even went to a few Sunday Services. They seemed quite educated on their opinions about The Bible and The Book of Mormon.

Class action lawsuits empower the people who were screwed over on small amounts. However, it probably wasn't a "small amount" to them at the time. As cryptorific said, there will likely be more people joining in on this.

No, for gold coins they probably just go to the cops.
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:35:01
Still nothing, sorry.

Where do I go to find information on volunteering? I'm in the state and I would like to take a trip up there one weekend.

Gold is just stardust. Bitcoin is truly a substance of human design.

You're supposed to educate the uneducated, not stop them from listening to the other side just because you think you're right.

Expect news spots for bitcoin to cover black market activity until everyone and their dogs know about bitcoin.
It is easy to steal a wallet.dat and the passwords laypersons use for normal online activity are not sufficient to secure them
Bitcoin is highly speculative and volatile, it is important that people know this before diving in. Bitcoin is worth what people are willing to pay/sell for it
They're presenting these spots for people who don't know about it.

The better question is, will they accept bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:05:56
It means that bitcoin is inflating faster than expected. So yes, it is a "problem". Thankfully this won't cause anymore bitcoins to be created than intended or impact the predictability of the rate of creation.
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:29:44
Having a predictable rate at which bitcoins are created is one of the many points that makes bitcoin attractive for use as a currency.
The question is whether or not we (the network) mind that they're being created at a faster rate than expected.

However, under the federal Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA), 31 U.S.C.A. §§ 5311 et seq., financial institutions are required to report deposits of more than $10,000 in cash made by an individual in a single day.

I think they would be quite novel in bars/clubs. Perhaps on the bar, like those game-machines.
