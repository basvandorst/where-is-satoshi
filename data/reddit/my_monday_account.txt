But bro!  My currency that holds no real practical value, which has shown remarkable instability, that requires enormous hoops to jump through just to use it as a valid currency, and which becomes useless to everyone if there isn't an internet connection available, and which is only accepted by a very niche subsection of the world, is SO MUCH BETTER than your dumb paper currency that holds no real practical value but which is universally accepted and requires absolutely no perquisites to make use of instantly.

No it's not about that at all. It's about trying to justify your investment by carefully cherry-picking success stories from the past while ignoring the fact that statistically the system is very likely to crumble at some point.
No intelligent adult considers a currency that absolutely requires an internet connection just to even use to be a viable replacement for Fiat.  As soon as it becomes unprofitable to mine Bitcoin, all the investors will dump their shares and we'll see another big crash. The only thing that makes Bitcoin different from garlic or any other meme cryptocurrency is the fact that Bitcoin went viral first. It could have easily been Litecoin or any of the others but it was Bitcoin so now everybody's patting themselves on the back and assuring themselves that this is a smart investment.

It's easy to pick and choose  your success stories when you're trying to make a point but putting out completely bias nonsense like this isn't going to win anyone to your side.
