It's not "bias" when you call out an obvious attack with facts and sources. We need to take a stand for the real decentralized Bitcoin against those groups interested in undermining it for their own selfish interests.

Thank you for this post, this issue was what prompted me to stop being a lurker, open an account here and post for the first time a few days ago:






It is incredible how most people are missing this obvious plot by those bad actors seeking power and control without taking into account the damage they can do. We need to raise our voice and expose this attack for what it is.

I think that too, but let's not give this attack *any* chance. It's frustrating to see the large amount of companies still alowing their name to be displayed as supportive of this insanity.

We are badly dropping the ball regarding the coming S2X attack, please don't get complacent just because the previous attacks have failed, this one is different (it has many powerful Bitcoin companies and most miners behind it). Here's what to do:

I hope Barry, Ver, Jihan, Erik, etc. get the karma they deserve, eventually. They can't keep hiding behind the disguise of "good intentions" forever.

Nice, I'm using that next time. Or "you can poison a pitch of water with a drop of venom".

That's right, most of the volume now is the west panic selling. Hold on guys, no reason to sell your coins. All Chinese exchanges closing down should be priced-in already. Be ready, the bounce-up will be faster than the drop, and since mostly strong hands (Hodlers) will remain, Bitcoin will emerge stronger. It is good news that China is out of the game, no more FUD from them since they played their cards and they folded. Don't fold also, you have the winning cards in your hands (if you haven't sold).
