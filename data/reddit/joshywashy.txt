coinbase.com   
Verification is pretty simple and instantaneous if you log into your bank account.  Good thing about coinbase is that once you confirm your purchase,  you are locked in at the price you agreed upon.  You have to wait 1 week for the transaction to go through, but this is to prevent you from calling your bank and saying someone "hacked" your account, fucking over coinbase.    If you are not day trading bitcoins then waiting 1 week isn't that much of a problem.  
Also, idiots who are not careful get hacked.  Don't just download any program people tell you to download.  Do some goddamn research on what others tell you to download.  Scour forums and only get programs from a legitimate established site.  Watch our for phishing sites. 
In my personal opinion, blockchain is perfectly fine.  They have 2 step verification via text message or email.  Just remember your login information and you will be fine. 
Do NOT download bitcoin apps on your phone.  IF you use 2 factor text verification or email verification this is DANGEROUS, REMEMBER that if use a smart phone and someone steals your phone, and you just happen to be logged into your wallet, then guess where verification is sent?  Directly to your phone and email where the thief can verify they are you.

Bitcoins are a great idea for a unified currency that brings the power of money back to the hands of the people.  Bitcoins for the most part are unhackable.  It's the exchanges and wallet websites that are vulnerable to attacks and theft.

 If people decide to hoard bitcoins, that just means there's less bitcoins in circulation and the value will go up.  Whenever, bitcoins does reach its "stable" point years or decades from now, I think the market will automatically adjust itself to the right price such that it reflects the value people are willing trade for goods based on the value and scarcity of the coins at the time.  Yes, the hoarders can cash out their bitcoins in the future, but they will not all do it at the same time.   But who knows.

I am no stock expert, so everything I say is based on pure speculation and just things that I have observed over the months  :)
Let's say I am BFL and I have  10k BTC with bitcoins going for  $100/coin.  The Bid priced and volume  are spread out from $100 dollars all the way down to $0 in increasing volume (from high to low).  If BFL acquired these 10k BTC and wanted to pay a fabrication facility to create chips for them, they have to convert all these to 10k BTC to fiat.   Now there is no way they can find a handful of buyers to buy 10k coins @ $100/coin since the bid prices are spread out.  Instead they have to sell the coins from $100 to $90 so they can sell their 10k volume of coins, thus driving the price of bitcoins all the way down to $90/coin.    THe further decrease in price is probably attributed to the daily up and down of the market in addition to speculators panic selling in response.  So just because the price took a sudden dive doesn't necessarily mean there's someone dumping to manipulate the market.  There's just someone or group out there trying to cash out for whatever reason.  
But this is just me hoping that the price doesn't continue to take a dive, but I do think that 15k bitcoin volume is coming from 1 person/company trying to cash out for whatever reason, and not due to price manipulation.

If anything, this is not some gamble or cash out scheme by the twins.  They are going through the proper channels to somewhat legitimize bitcoins and I believe they are the ones to bring the proper hype to those still confused by what cryptocurrencies are.    Just imagine the trouble they would get in if they decided to sell all their coins and fuck thousands of people.     I don't think anyone is willing to dump millions into a business  without being 90% sure of what they are doing and not have a carefully thought out business plan.

Yes, our government is corrupt on many levels (eg, government servants getting double paid.)  On the plus side, if we do switch from fiat to bitcoins, the public would have a way to view all transactions done by the government.  If the government can spy on us, then we should be able to spy on the government.

This is why we have a tax system in the first place because we can't rely on people to donate money for roads and schools out of the goodness out of their own hearts.  Yes, there are services that we pay for that we don't want but this is the nature of the beast.  We do have a system in place that let's us vote for services we do and do not want.  Its fucking called voting.  We have to remember, there are a lot of idiots in the world (gun toting war hungry Americans) these people actually want to go to war to "serve" the country.

I think you fail to see why we even have bitcoin mining.  By design, bitcoin mining was meant to let people benefit from mining while securing the network (mutually beneficial).  If you gain nothing from mining, no one would mine.  Do you honestly think anyone would blow $400 a month in electricity on GPU mining for nothing?   
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:40:05
I came into bitcoins accepting the fact that I might lose 50% of my money and that's what happened today.   I also hoped i would double or triple up, which happened a few weeks ago.  You gain some you lose some, this is the market.  I will however, hold on to my bitcoins and not panic sell.  
Mt Gox has been through this DDOS nonsense a few times already and the market has rebounded and came back stronger than before.  Granted, the past attacks where only half as bad, i think it will be ok in the long run. 
To me, even though there's tens of thousands of people selling off their bitcoins in a mass panic or for profit, there's also tens of thousands of people waiting to buy those bitcoins from all over the world the very second Mt Gox comes back online.  Initially the price might drop to 40 because of the huge amounts of sell orders probably in line right now, but the demand will drive it back up to normal again.  Yes the price swing was 266 to 150 to 180 to 80, but we have to realize the bitcoin market has grown hugely in the span of a few weeks.   IN the span of 2 months I have seen bitcoins go from 40 to 266, far faster than what the bitcoin community can control.   Now we are seeing a growth from 40 to 90 in 2 months time, which to me is still pretty good to me.

It all depends on whether it is a buyer or seller's market. Lets say the current price of bitcoins is $100.   If demand is lower than supply, someone can post 1000 BTC @ $95.   Since demand is relatively low at that particular point in time, people will probably want to scoop up the coins at the lower price, thus driving the price down momentarily.   I suggest looking at the bid/ask graphs for reference. 
Thats my reasoning anyways.  Probably not correct lol

Anyone with a slightest technical background can agree that in order to hack and create a counterfeit bitcoin becomes harder over time.  WIth increase amount of miners to verify transactions and blocks, hackers would have to increase their computing power as well just to keep up.

@_date: 2013-04-24 17:53:50
Let me put this in perspective.  
CPU only mining gets you around 5 MH/s (Core i7 sandy  ghz for me). GPU mining gets you anywhere from 100 MH/s with a low end card (AMD 6670), to 2,000 MH/s on an expensive multi-GPU rig.  ASICS range from 5,000 MH/s (2 bitcoins a week @ the current difficulty) to 60,000 GH/s all the way to 1,500,000 MH/s.  
So compare 5 MH/s to 60,000 MH/s.  If you mine for a year on a CPU you are mining 12,000 times slower than the ASICscoming out.  
 you can plug in the numbers yourself.

While we reserve the right to handle refund requests on a case by case basis, pre-ordered products are non-refundable as is clearly stated at the time of purchase.  The reason for this is that pre-order funds are used in the build process which makes it impractical to reverse.  It's also been observed that some small number of customers have placed orders as part of a bitcoin price hedging strategy which involves multiple requests to cancel and then re-enstate their orders as market conditions change.  This has created an enormous customer service burden which is resolved by enforcing the all sales final policy.
Some customers have asked why we've given order cancellation refunds to others, but they can't get one.  The answer is that we had opted to process order cancellation requests during our long product development phase as a courtesy to those who endured the stress of the unknown.  However, once full production began, a notice was sent out advising that orders would be shipped as produced according to the order queue and that if anyone was unwilling to endure the wait, they had a final opportunity to cancel.  Customers were required to positively confirm their desire to remain in the order queue and accept the order terms.
Pre-Order terms for new orders were updated on the website on April 1, 2013.  The terms state, "I accept the terms of the sale and understand that all sales are final and there is a backlog of orders and production &amp; delivery of my order may take 2 months or longer."
As a Wyoming Corporation, we operate under the US Federal Trade Commission's business guide for mail or telephone ordered merchandise.  The relevant guideline suggests that if no delivery terms are stated or agreed to, then 30 days should be assumed.  In our case, we've gone to great length to ensure there is no ambiguity.  Customers are/were notified of the back order situation, the inability to cancel their order and the multi month wait to be expected. However, we have added a new feature to your account dashboard. You have the option of selling your order. There are more details and instructions on how to do so on our facebook page. 
Announcing a Pre-Order Marketplace
Butterfly Labs is excited to announce a platform that will help merge the needs of both parties. A seller will be able to announce the sale of their pre-order position in our classifieds forum. They will establish the terms of sale and make the deal on their own. Once a deal has been made, they will use the transfer system in their account Dashboard to transfer an order to a new owner. When both parties verify and agree to the terms, the order will be moved to the buyer's account.
The order transfer system was set in place September 10, 2013.Butterfly Labs will only provide the platform for the order transfer to take place. We are not responsible for any deals made between our customers. Use of the order transfer system is solely the risk of the parties making the order transfer deal. Buyer's must agree to the original terms of the sale, and specifically to the no refund policy.
Here is the relevant FTC guideline text:
"when you advertise merchandise, you must have a reasonable basis for stating or implying that you can ship within a certain time. If you make no shipment statement, you must have a reasonable basis for believing that you can ship within 30 days."
Kindest Regards,
Butterfly Labs

I dont think its mathematically impossible to counterfeit, but I may be wrong.  From my understanding, every time a new bitcion is created, it is based on a blockchain verified by thousands of miners who use great amounts of processing power to compute it.  In order to create a fake bitcoin, a hacker would have to have an equal or greater amount of computational power (hundreds if not thousands of terahashes) in order to change the block chain and convince all the miners who have hashed it, that this new bitcoin is legitimate.  Thus as more bitcoins and transactions increase in the network, the brute force mining power has to be increased to compensate and to duplicate bitcoins becomes ever so harder.

There is no good way to counter the botnet ddos attacks.  Before the botnet used lag and bruteforce attacks  to cause people to panic sell the price to oblivion.  
Now, the botnet operator is using Mt Gox' new and improved engine to execute his trades even faster by buying and selling and moving the price up and down as he pleases.  Mt Gox can limit the 0.001 bitcoin trades but the botnet operator just changes his buy/sell prices between 0.016 or 0.0138. Just look at Clarkmoody's bid/ask chart.   Just because you build a faster trading engine doesn't mean the botnet can't take advantage of it.
