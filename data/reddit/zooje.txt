The biggest and only real driver of long term sustainable price is usage. So yeah, if they provide a useful function and people want to use them, they will impact price.

All cloud mining is highly likely to be a scam. At worst they don't even have any real hardware and simply pay back a portion of your initial investment as mining rewards. At best they have hardware and have already calculated that its more profitable to them to rent it out than mine with it themselves, so you'll likely not break even.

Nonsense, theres nothing holding back bitcoin, its making incredible strides froward on a daily basis. If he's talking about what's holding back the bitcoin price then, 6 people who are all pushing their own digital currencies are probs the wrong crowd to ask, any economist can tell you, that the price is not being 'held back' it represents the cumulative market sentiment, which is exactly what it is supposed to do.

Chicken and egg problem here...If it fails due to storage requirements, there wont be much storage requirements.  If it becomes hugely successful, there will be alot of data to store... but by then failure is a moot point because.. its already hugely successfull

Bitcoin will finally expose the fact that the big banking interests run the government. In London 'The City' is essentially an independent city state within London, its history long pre-dates the current government status quo and even the Queen cant enter the square mile that is 'the city' without special permission.

Yes, your wrong. 
Mining pools don't own their hardware. So mining pools are in now way the same as a large miner with the equivalent hashpower.
There are no pools with a large enough chunk of the hashrate to be a significant problem, let alone any individual large miners.
Relax, Bitcoin is working exactly is it should. So...according to everything we know about technology trends and economics, we are still on course to free the world from financial tyranny and get a little wealthier in the process.
How did your btc investment go ? All in cold storage now ?

No chance, with independence comes sovereignty and that usually means firing up the printing presses and starting another debt based fiat currency fraud. No way the newly sovereign Scottish leaders are gonna give up the opportunity to print themselves rich by adopting bitcoin. Why would they ?
And why on earth would they be attracted to the euro either ??? No Chance, If they stay sterling the then vote and breakup is essentially meaningless anyway. Theyll end up going for something called the 'scottish pound' or similar, a totally new fiat currency that looks and feels like sterling, as a marketing gimmick.

Except that the payment mechanism and the currency unit are inseparable,  without the block reward you don't have a decentralised ledger.

Store value in a way that requires any number of co-operating parties to move/use it.

The likelihood of a single entitiy attempting this, out of so many with the available resources, is slim to nothing, and if multiple groups try to do it at the same time... well that benefits everyone, no ?
