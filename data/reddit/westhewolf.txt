If you had just bought Bitcoin and not tried to trade it on margin you would've been fine. 
Margin trading is for serious traders. Good ones. Not people that only half know what is going on. 
You got rekt due to inexperience, trading on money you couldn't afford to lose.

Give it a few months maybe. The dogecoin is still very much a puppy.
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:12:55
Can confirm. There are devout users that spend every day trying to make dogecoin happen. To thousands of people it is NOT a joke. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:08:04
It may be wise to diversify your crypto portfolio!
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:05:48
The fact that it's both a joke and not a joke is what makes it so powerful. It is the yin and yang of the crypto world. Balance is key.
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:22:01
K. Then good. At least you tried.

You misunderstand. He would only be a douchenozzle if he doesn't reach out to them and just comes online and talks trash. But, it looks like he did reach out and therefore he's not a douchenozzle.
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:53:05
You could write them a kind email explaining that you've been a member for two years and that whatnot... Kind of like you did here. See what a real person says. If they don't respond or are dicks, then yeah. Go find a different vendor. But until you try that, you really are just a self-entitled douchenozzle.
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:16:37
It's a joke to some, which makes it approachable. But, it's serious to others, which makes it viable (lots of development and infrastructure building going on).

What happened to unidan?
@_date: 2019-03-22 19:15:33
He's 7'6".... She's probably 5' or 4'11" or something. Crazy.
@_date: 2019-03-22 19:40:59
Damn. That's crazy. She's not even that small.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:16:51
Yup... They wait for the buys to start creeping up and then WHAM. First whale goes. Second follows. Third one freaks out and tries to catch the remaining buys, and next thing you know the price has dropped a couple hundred bucks and you see a huge buy wall go up at the lower price. Pretty pro.

Just not sure what Gemini is all about. Depends on if they allow trading right away.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:18:15
I'm completely in alts and am avoiding all of that business. The whales are gonna be out in full force and shit is gonna pump and dump and pump and dump super hard. Huge potential to make alot of money, but also huge potential to lose a bunch. 
I'll be holding Walton, LINK, Power Ledger, and Vericoin for the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:42:24
Hah. You willing to bet against me? Or you just wanna see a grown hairy wolf lick his fingered asshole?
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:01:46
Sick. Yeah, I went in hard this may/June and am up 28x working alts. I'm obsessed. Love it. Good luck to you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:37:15
You may know all that... but you still might not understand the blockchain, the blockchain ecosystem, smart contracts, digital assets, digital identites, and the internet of value being built by trustless and decentralized platforms which will revolutionize the way we do business in many sectors. 
BTW I think bitcoin sucks. But, it has first mover advantage and is the access point from fiat to the blockchain ecosystem mentioned above. That's where it's real value comes from. Everything else is hype. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:38:18
When it gets to $7450 per BTC. SELL. 
Then wait until after the fork selloff. Buy back at a comfortable spot. Maybe that's 7k. Maybe that 6.8k. Maybe see how low it goes and buy on the dead cat bounce at 5.8k. Or buy back at 4.8k. 
That's what I would do.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:50:02
I can't tell the future exactly, that's why I'm throwing out numbers.... but... if I were trading bitcoin I would sell at 7400, and then buy back a little at 6800 and 6500. 
I'm a conservative at shorting. Don't have the stomach to catch the bottom because usually it only bottoms for a minute before it gets bought back up. 
But either way, bitcoin will go down after the fork, not sure for how long, but it will go down. 100% guaranteed. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:10:33
Haha. Don't we all??
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:32:20
Not sure about A or B. C is a guaranteed no. The mempool will be sky high, and unless you have your coins on an exchange that is readily trading, you will likely miss the fun while you wait for the transaction. Especially in the case coinbase. I'm pretty sure last time they froze all in and out for at least 24 hours.

I don't disagree with the price sentiment, but I do disagree with usefulness. What I mentioned are elements of fundamental analysis, as opposed to technical analysis. And actually, those elements are specifically what makes the items useful or not. 
Other blockchain companies are doing amazing things, I don't want to shill anything here, but tokens and platforms like Ethereum (app platform), Power Ledger (energy trading), chainlink (oracles on smart contracts), Walton (integrated RFID platform for supply chain) are doing very interesting and ground breaking work. The way you would evaluate them from a price perspective is completely different than a stock because they are not designed like stocks and dont behave like stocks. 
The aforementioned platforms are not shares in a company, rather, they are tokens in a mini-economy that allow for the trustless transfer of value in ways that previously could not be exchanged on an open platform. The decentralized nature of these protocols will vastly reduce the barrier to entry into these economies, and will in some cases greatly reduce cost and increase efficiency of value exchange. 
Where will it all go? I don't know and no one knows because it's a whole different beast. Is bitcoin in a bubble? Definitely. Is crypto in a bubble? Not even close. The digital economy is just getting started and I firmly believe it will be valued in the 10's of trillions.

Algotrading is a thing. But it's pretty complicated, so not everyone could make a bot that works in all conditions. A bot that makes money under certain market conditions might lose lots of money under other conditions. Humans are better at adapting to these macro trends and making decision changes.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:49:02
Good. Yeah that's a good approach. Dollar cost average. Just be mentally prepared for it to be under 3500. 
Last time BTC hit a high without an imminent fork it went from 4k to 1.8k before coming back up again. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 21:10:00
It's more like history than horoscope. But ok.
@_date: 2019-04-05 21:10:45
Elliott Wave theory would give you reasonable probability of whether or not something is topping out or not.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:05:18
Definitely. I been following this for a bit. So much money is in bitcoin that proportionally would be in other crypto's, but people are buying up bitcoin for the fork. It will redistribute before it makes another run up. Redistribution to other cryptos = bitcoin going down. If it doesn't go below $6,800 I will finger my asshole and lick it. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:53:44
Holy shit. This. Thank you. That's what's so ridiculous about crypto taxation right now. They are applying old laws to new technology and it just isn't appropriate and will stifle innovation.
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:54:51
It's absurd.
@_date: 2017-09-17 09:12:30
This is actually a bill designed to DDOS Bitcoin and to overload the blockchain. It will encourage people to make small transactions for no reason, and therefore bog it down. 
It's a Trojan Horse. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:32:41
Interesting thought. I think that is possible, and logical, but politics would get in the way in alot of cases. Some countries will do it, but I can't possibly see that happening in U.S... we can't get healthcare figured out, so I'm much more pessimistic about figuring out money. But who knows!
I'm really interested in watching all of these new sectors and use cases develop. Things like record keeping, data management, digital assets, digitization of work/value. I think blockchain will create new ways of leveraging human potential that we haven't seen or had a way to value in the past. People will be able to incentivize behavior that was previously not rewardable under fiat system. Bringing out the popcorn for that one!
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:02:55
400x.... puts it at 28trillion.
Global supply of money in the world is in the ballpark of 80-90trillion.
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:21:04
I definitely do not think that bitcoin will be number one. In fact, I think there will be some major pains, and a flippening of sorts at some point in the not too distant future. 
My apologies, I was speaking to the global marketcap of all blockchain tech.
I agree with your analysis above. I'm a history and economics major, with masters in public admin, and work in the health field. I take a long view on everything and my valuation of 400x and comparisons to stocks is based on blockchain as an asset class, not bitcoin alone. Bitcoin alone is just a decentralized venmo. It's the smart contract functionality that is the game changer that is bringing real use value to businesses. I'm mainly holding WTC and LINK right now, and pretty much never fuck with BTC unless I have to. It will go the way of Netscape, Aol, and Yahoo. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:02:32
We don't know yet. But I'm damned sure people will figure it out, and there may be alot of growing pains in the process.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:34:18
BTC isn't known for its scalability. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 11:02:01
If you sold Walton chain at $44. You could buy... 38 WTC for every WTC sold.

They don't destroy them. That's for damned sure.
