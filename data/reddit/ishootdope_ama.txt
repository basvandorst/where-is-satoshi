That's not a requirement of UBI. It's just a popular proposal.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:49:11
Yes I'm picking up the BS from both of you.  How do you propose to keep businesses from grabbing what one was state controlled power?

Yeah you know it won't work out but you hope it does anyway, making you delusional.

True, but still having welfare doesn't make it not UBI.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:37:07
Wait, what?  Do either of you have an actual response?
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:55:57

Right.  But bitcoin's viability was proven on silk road.  Without it none of these big names would have jumped on.
@_date: 2014-10-03 15:11:35
I know it explains mine.
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:46:23
Duh, so I can cash my check at the bank. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 11:31:07
But there won't even be a billion of them.
@_date: 2014-10-03 13:54:47
If you think Silk Road didn't have a huge effect on bitcoin you are fucking cracked.
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:21:33
This attitude will surely help bitcoin adoption. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:18:49
I under stand that, but if I have a billion cents you would say I'm a billionaire.
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:25:14

Did you try a dvd or vm?  Maybe your is was corrupt?
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:15:03
No, I don't think that's the only solution though.  It's not all our nothing.  I'm not saying I like the way the system had been implemented, but I think there's a better way.  If you think if we deregulate now and the same people won't use that void to further consolidate their power and wealth, well I don't know what I can say.

I put Ross putting the hits out on the state. If operating SR wasn't illegal then he wouldn't have had to take such drastic measures to protect my safety.

What are you talking about? The foundation of bitcoin is a *public ledger*. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 13:34:19
Put your trezor in safe deposit box lol
@_date: 2015-04-26 21:14:55
Good point.  But why not keep the Trezor in a box at the bank? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:23:50
If you don't hold the private key, you don't hold the bitcoin. Leaving your btc on an exchange is antithetical to the idea of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:44:32
Ok, if you are stacked like that and that paranoid you should probably be strapped.

You might have noted on there that Bitcoin is money.  Like real money that you can spend and buy things.  Most people will think this is just some stupid flyer or some kind of scam.
I know we here are all for bitcoin and *we* know what it is and what it's uses are.  But *most* people haven't even *heard* of bitcoin and aren't going to do the research to find out what they've just discovered.
I also hope you saved the private keys, and if you didn't that you haven't left too many of these around town.  You are basically just throwing your money away.
