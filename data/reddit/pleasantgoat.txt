Technically you asked two questions. ;)
Question the First: is the point of bitcoin that it can be tumbled and made anonymous? My answer is that it is not the "point" of bitcoin. It is one of many features that bitcoin is claimed to possess. Frankly, the anonymous (really pseudonymous) nature of bitcoin is less interesting than other features.
In truth, I have my suspicions that the so-called anonymity of bitcoin is a trap. Sufficiently powerful traffic analysis and/or compromised tumblers could reveal the identity of the user. Three Letter Agencies have both the means and motive to invent an online currency that would appear anonymous, but actually be traceable.
Question the Second: what should be done if the identity of the thief is revealed? Presumably victims of the Gox theft would petition the jurisdiction where the thief currently lives to extradite him to Japan to face criminal charges and they would also file civil charges against the thief.

Why would they want to disrupt bitcoin? It's making a public pseudonymous record of all the transactions.
All they need to do is compromise a few of the remixers to get the full record. And compromising the remixers is a trivial task compared to matching the hashrate of the whole network.

I did not downvote you, but I think your post glosses over the inherent tendency for competitors to form cartels and erect barriers to entry for new competitors.  There is no reason to expect for-profit BTC processors to behave any differently than credit card companies. 
The barrier to entry will come from the user side. How many BTC processor apps do you want on your phone? Why doesn't Paypal have a real competitor despite its many many flaws? I think that the first company to establish themselves gets a real homefield advantage and can price themselves just low enough (or give kickbacks to important clients) to make dislodging them very difficult.

Is that a moral statement from some perceived paternalism? Is it based on any form of evidence?
What is good for the economy is predictability. When the Fed is actually following its mandate and targeting both "moderate" inflation and "full" employment, the system works remarkably well.
When a currency is unpredictable, no one knows what to expect. How do you plan an investment when you don't know what market conditions will be like 1, 2, 5, 10 years from now?

Liquid cash is not invested in the economy, so why would you expect a return on it? Stocks, bonds, and treasury notes have all not lost value over the long term.

In mBTC/g, the ratio has never been close to one.

Inflation helps people who hold debt: mortgages, edu loans, farmers who but seed and fuel on credit.
