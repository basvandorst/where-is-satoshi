Yes sure, just follow the link to changetip.com and then login by linking your reddit account.  Then you can easily tip others just include the amount and Just try not to be too spammy with tips.  Its good to tip people when you agree with their comment, or they are providing valuable content.  Try tipping people on youtube or twitter as well to introduce them to bitcoin.  If they don't accept your tip it will be returned to you in 7 days, or you can cancel it anytime.

Hmmm, I tend to agree.  I have been trying to stay open-minded to hear the risks and arguments against sidechains. But I am just not seeing much there.  My gut tells me sidechains are what we need and are really important for Bitcoin's future.  Any problems will be worked out by the market.
Sidechains seem like a really elegant and beautiful solution to so many problems.  The competition and innovation they could allow really resonates with the idea of free market capitalism.  I have a lot of trust in the market to find solutions to everything, and opening up sidechains for innovation is going to allow the market to operate much more efficiently, solving problems at a super fast rate. 
I want freedom and I want the market to have all the tools at its disposal to innovate and solve problems and make Bitcoin more robust.  It seems this is what sidechains offer.  Also many will claim Bitcoiners only want sidechains to boost Bitcoins value against alt-coins.  Well when something gets better, it increases its value and price, that is just the way it is.  We are striving to be better, and the value/price is just a side effect.  Also if sidechains are implemented and the price goes up, that is actually evidence that sidechains are better and we are succeeding.

Blockchain.info is a good web wallet. They allow hosted control of your private keys, so its better than other web wallets which require complete trust of a 3rd party. They have had a lot of bugs and downtime recently though.  Id prefer to download my own wallet like Electrum and have more control.

Its an interesting point that is brought up a lot.  However I think its probably wrong.  When merchants adopt bitcoin, it gives people more reason to hold onto bitcoin until they finally spend it.  It also incentivizes more people to buy bitcoin, because it gives it more utility and places to spend it.
The main reason for the price slump is 3600 new bitcoins are mined every day, and about 1.5 million BTC mined per year.  This amounts to over 10% inflation when not even considering many coins are lost or destroyed forever.
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:34:40
You can use Bitcoin to buy things at many places including Overstock.com, Dell, NewEgg, TigerDirect, Dish Network, Expedia, etc.. Some brick and mortar places are accepting it as payment as well.  To send or receive Bitcoin you need to find your receive addresses.  They almost always start with a 1, and are a long alpha-numeric string.  If you have a smart phone you can scan a QR code to import an address into your mobile wallet.
 There are many types of [wallets](  Changetip acts as a wallet for you once your link your reddit account. You should try out some other wallets too.  Try to choose a wallet where you don't have to trust anyone else with your private keys.  I suggest [electrum](  Just write down your 12 word seed for backup.
The advantage of [electrum]( or [multibit]( is you do not have to download the whole blockchain which can take 3 days as with [Bitcoin Core]( the original client.  Also for more security look into [cold storage]( and [paper wallets](  Also look into hardware wallets like [Trezor]( which keep your keys safe on an external device, but still allow you to spend from them.  [This]( wallet is pretty good for Android, and [bread wallet]( is good for i-phone.  Mycelium also seems widely recommended.  Hopefully some of these links will help.

But on the contrary you may be for preserving your wealth from FIAT collapses, banker bailouts, and bail-ins due to the Fed and central banks who are tripling the money supply, and pumping banks and the stock market with fake value.  Then you may want to invest in Bitcoin, as well as gold, silver and other sound monies.
@_date: 2014-11-18 00:17:24
I see, thanks its a little more clear now.  Its still a little hard to grasp for my puny brain.  This brings a few more thoughts up however.  Like there would still be fees collected on the original main chain as well as the sidechain.  Yet perhaps the sidechain would be much more profitable for miners due to a larger amount of transactions.  
So if miners joined the sidechain, then simultaneously attacked the main chain, wouldn't it still threaten their holdings? So how exactly do the incentives change? If they break the main chain, won't the sidechain fail also? Or will everyone switch to the sidechain and then that becomes the main chain?
If this is indeed a serious threat shouldn't there be some solutions? For example a different mining algorithm on the sidechain could prevent miners on the sidechain from attacking the main chain? 
Would this only be a threat if the sidechain gains significant popularity?  Is this only a problem when the block reward diminishes to 0?  There is a lot of uncertainty on what will happen when the block reward reaches 0 anyways.  If Bitcoin is so easily attacked when the reward reaches 0, could sidechains provide a solution? 
Also could there be a sidechain that issues increasing block rewards istead of relying on fees, but the only thing is if you transfer 1 BTC to the sidechain, and then over a year the sidechain coins have 10% inflation, so if you want to change back into the BTC chain you will only get 0.9 BTC?  
Hopefully I added some food for thought, if not, please disregard my incoherent ramblings ;)

Go ahead and order with your credit card, and give your private key to strangers and broadcast it over the web for [hackers]( to steal your identity.  Then make sure to get permission from your bank before you buy it.  Also dont buy anything governments don't like or you may be put on their list for investigation. 
Also don't deposit less than 10,000 dollars into your bank account, that is [structuring](  Also don't deposit more than 10,000 dollars into your bank account or they may file a [CTR](  If you deposit less than 10,000 you will be elligible for a [SAR]( as well.  
Go ahead and use a FIAT money system, where they give trillions of bailouts to banks, and [tripled]( the money supply since 2008.
But you are right the government is not dump, they are super smart, they got everything under control.

[Bitaddress]( seems to be the oldest, and most trusted.  If you use an untrusted wallet generator it can cause big problems.  They can use bad entropy or other tricks so that they can later steal your coins.  This happened with some brain wallet generators in the past. 
I am pretty sure many people have audited the code for the bitaddress website.  Also you can download the [bitaddress]( html.  Then you can use the file to load up the website without needing internet connection.  This along with a bootable ubuntu operating system is a secure way to make cold storage paper wallets.
@_date: 2014-11-13 22:43:44
Yes they will probably be adjusted.  In the past the fees were a lot larger than they are now.  Its not really a tax because the miners are providing a valuable service of securing the network.  I think there is a system to allow competition with fees now, but I am not sure exactly how it all works.

Maybe you have been using fake money your whole life, and bitcoin is the real money ;)
But really because its permissionless.  The government cant [seize]( and [steal]( your money.  You can send it to anyone you want across the globe for nothing.

It can't be printed out of thin air like the dollar which has tripled its money supply since 2008. To name a few.

No its easy.  Just download electrum wallet, and they will give you several receive addresses.  The receive addresses are alpha-numeric strings and always begin with a 1, unless they are multi-signature addresses which begin with a 3.  Copy one of your receive addresses from electrum and paste it into the send form on changetip.com.  Then type the amount and click send.  Sometimes changetip takes a while to verify withdrawals.
With changetip there are no fees right now for withdrawing.  But usually when you send bitcoin around there is a miners fee that you pay of usually 100 bits.  Its actually optional to provide the fee, but if you don't provide any fee there is a high chance you will have to wait several hours or a day before the miners will accept your transaction.  The fee gives them incentive to accept it faster in the next block.  Blocks are found by miners every 10 minutes on average.

I am really having trouble grasping the concept of how sidechains allow attacks on Bitcoin. I guess I don't understand exactly how the mining of sidechains work yet.

The attack is on sound money.  It could even possibly be an attempt to link Libertarianism to ISIS.  May sound crazy, but they would love to link the two and then use the Patriot Act against Libertarian and Constitutionalists for "domestic terrorism".  This is already happening with [FEMA]( teaching local police that the Christians and the Founding Fathers were terrorists.
Also the release of the [MIAC Homeland Security Rerport]( in Missouri listed constitutionalists, libertarians, and [Ron Paul supporters]( as possible terrorists.  Also includes anyone skeptical of the Federal Reserve.

Decentralization is very important.  But the world is more complex than just decentralization or centralization.  Its not just black or white.  Its good to have a market of competition between small centralized entities.  
Yes when examining the entities themself it looks like centralization.  But zoom out and you will see a bigger picture of many small centralized services competing with each other, and it starts to look more decentralized.  A free market with competition has many decentralized aspects.
Also tools like multi-signature can make it so we don't have to trust these central services quite as much.

No it cant wipe it, because those transactions are on the blockchain.  Electrum is an HD wallet, meaning you only back it up once, and all of the addresses are in a string related to each other.
If you want to wipe and have a new wallet, then delete your current wallet files after moving all bitcoin to a temporary wallet.  Then create a new wallet with a new seed and write down your new seed word-list.

If the side chain proposal gets worked into the core bitcoin protocol, then you will have more options and get-away plans.  With side chains, if bitcoin becomes corrupted we can just move our coins onto a side chain, which is secured by Bitcoin's giant hashing network, and the value of the bitcoin is maintained as well using the 2-way peg system.
Seems pretty important for the libertarian/decentralization crowd if they want to preserve freedom.  Andreas Antonopoulos talks about it in this video at the 43 min mark:  
Edit: This side chain proposal seems like it would enable huge amounts of innovation onto bitcoin, while boosting the price as well.  Bitcoin would become sort of like the reserve currency for all other crypto currencies.  Don't like Bitcoin's transparency or think the privacy is lacking?  Just switch your Bitcoins onto the privacy/anonymous chain, while still maintaining bitcoin's original value, and the ability to go back into the main Bitcoin chain by changing your coins back to bitcoin anytime. Its also a decentralized exchange mechanism. Having this escape plan also helps put things in check and changes the game theory so that co-opters will not want to try to co-opt bitcoin knowing we have an escape plan.

There are many options for [wallets]( some are similar to banks where you trust them to hold your coins.  But the beauty of Bitcoin, is it allows you to be your own bank if you want to. This way you don't have to trust anybody except yourself, and the trustless Bitcoin network. Use a wallet like [Bitcoin-qt/Bitcoin Core]( if you don't mind downloading the whole blockchain.  If you want a lighter weight client try [electrum]( or [multi-bit]( wallet.  You can also have mobile wallets like [bread wallet]( for I-phone, or the blockchain ap.  Also [this wallet]( is good for Android.

Those that say its not backed by anything just don't understand it, or just don't want to think deeply about it.

Its probably a bad idea.  There are so many rules and regulations, that anybody doing any business can be found to be doing something illegal.  Also Bitcoin is hated by regulators, governments, and banks.  So you will have an even bigger target on your back.  Its just not wise to have a business in America anymore.

Finally figured out how to install uTox on Ubuntu.  Couldn't get qTox to work.  Pretty sure this is what you need to install uTox.
* First go here  and download uTox 32 bit version.
* Then go to terminal and type:
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake checkinstall check git yasm
Hit enter, when asked [y/n] hit y and hit enter.
* Then go to terminal and do:   
git clone 
cd uTox
* Then after this go find the binaries file you downloaded before and extract it.  It will create a uTox icon.  Double click it to launch uTox.

They should legalize all drugs and end the drug war since the drug war is unconstitutional anyways.  The drug war causes vastly more problems in society than drugs do. The drug war is responsible for the vast majority of laundering money.  Its responsible for thousands of deaths and the highest incarceration rate on Earth.
If the law enforcement want to prevent money laundering why don't they go after the [banks]( who launder trillions and only get a slap on the wrist?  It shows there is no goal to stop money laundering.  The goal is to milk tax payers of as much as possible in the name of regulations, while the regulators are owned and operated by the big banks and the real criminals at the top of the pyramid.
If it was constitutional to ban substances, then why did they need a constitutional amendment for alcohol prohibition?

Yeah Liberty is a pretty complicated subject and it always exists in a constant struggle against tyranny.  Probably liberty always exists on a spectrum and there is never absolute liberty or absolute slavery either for that matter.  Because even a prisoner usually has the liberty to read inside his prison cell, or other liberties afforded to him.  There will always be limits on freedom, but its a balancing act. 
In my opinion the country is incredibly out of balance, and swinging towards tyranny in every way, shape, and form.  I will try my best to throw my weight in the other direction ;)

First of all the tweet you posted was by a woman.  Looks like she was just making a joke about Peter Todd's funny looking appearance.  
Women are great and the species could not go on without them. Women and men are equally important. But men and women have a lot of differences.  For example you don't see too many women programmers contributing to Bitcoin.  You don't see too many women heading up start-ups or starting new businesses. But when it comes to the regulation side of you see a much larger percent of women championing regulation and government.  As a feminist how would you explain this?

There is a privacy benefit in that your bank won't know your transaction details and won't share it with a third party, because they do not know about the transaction.  Also a privacy advantage is in that you do not have to give your credit card number to someone over the internet where it can be intercepted or used without your permission.  Also the transaction can't be declined because your credit card company is scared that someone hacked their lousy system and stole your data, or if the banks/government disapprove of what you are purchasing.

100 bits @_date: 2014-11-16 13:40:24
Bitcoin is more fair because no central bank can print the money to inflate the stock market.  No central bank can print money to give Banker bailouts like in 2008.  Right now manipulators can steal everything, claim they are going bankrupt when it goes wrong, then get bailed out by tax payers. 
You can get caught for manipulation in BTC, in fact everything is available to see right on the blockchain.   That is why the real manipulators that control billions don't like Bitcoin.  The real problem is people who get their money through government scams or can print money out of thin air.  Then they buy off regulators, and get away with market manipulation on a giant scale even when they are caught red handed. 
Ever hear of the [Libor Scandal](  Nobody even got in trouble, they got some minor fines only.  You think thats the only manipulation happening?  If you see one cockroach on the floor, that means there are about 100 more you didn't see behind the refridgerator and under the carpet.  Give us transparency on the blockchain and you can stop the real criminals manipulating markets with billions.  Stop worrying about the kid in his mom's basement playing pump and dump games on cryptsy.  There are a lot more powerful people that use the FIAT central bank debt system for the real manipulation of markets.

Personally I wouldn't bother with mining, as you have heard its unprofitable.  Also I have heard warnings about mining contracts, and some of the cloud mining services may be using fractional reserve techniques leading to a lot of risk.  There is a lot of trust involved, and many companies in this space have ran away with the money in the past, so beware and do your research.
I would suggest just buying and holding your coins really.  The price is much lower than the all time high and has a lot of upside potential in my opinion. 
But you should really check out a wallet where you can hold your own private keys instead of trusting coins.ph.  Probably its safe to trust them, but is probably good enough for you?  We have seen catastrophes like MtGox.  Bottom line is, if you don't own your own private keys you don't own bitcoins.  You only own a promise from someone else to pay you bitcoins.
You should really get yourself a real Bitcoin wallet where you control the private keys.  You can look at many of the existing wallets [here](  
I suggest downloading [electrum]( for a PC.  Just write down your 12 word seed for backup.
Another option is [multibit]( Also you can try [Bitcoin Core]( the original client but Bitcoin Core client can take up to 3 days to download the blockchain.  Electrum and multibit are lightweight clients and don't require that.
Also for more security look into [cold storage]( and [paper wallets](  Also find out about hardware wallets like [Trezor]( which keep your keys safe on an external device, but still allow you to spend from them.  
There are mobile wallets too. [This]( wallet is pretty good for Android, and [bread wallet]( is good for i-phone.  [Airbitz]( also seems like a cool new wallet.  It also  has a business directory.  [Mycelium]( also seems widely recommended, and I hear it has a local trader option as well to find people to buy and sell bitcoins in your area..  Hopefully some of these links will help you out.
You can also spend bitcoins at many places including Overstock.com, Dell.com, NewEgg, TigerDirect, Dish Network, Expedia, etc...  Also some brick and mortar establishments, and restaurants are accepting it.  You can also use the [gyft]( ap to buy gift cards with bitcoin and use them anywhere like Home Depot, Sears, Amazon, Burger King, etc..
You can also play [poker]( or other [casino games]( for bits.  Also since you are in the Philippines try out [BitStars](  You can tip others or receive tips for your selfie photos.  Also check out [Buyload.ph]( where you can buy mobile loads for Bitcoin online.  Also check out [Bills.ninja]( which is a website that allows you to pay bills with bitcoins in the Philippines.  Also [CashCashPinoy]( also accept Bitcoin payment.  Hopefully some of these links will help you out.
Also check out changetip, it allows you to tip Bitcoins on reddit, youtube, twitter, etc...

You may have misunderstood what the OP was trying to say.  I suggest watching [this video]( at the 43 minute mark.  Andreas Antonopoulos goes into the importance of sidechains.  You are correct with what you said about the beauty of the distributed system.  But sidechains take this decentralization and bring it to a whole new level.  It can protect Bitcoin from attacks from governments or centralization.  This is the "insurance" the OP is mentioning.  It can allow unlimited innovation.  You could have sidechains where you transform your bitcoin into a sidechain coin that has new features like anonymity, faster confirmations, micro transactions etc. (Also with a 2-way peg you can transform back into Bitcoin any time). If anyone tried to mess with Bitcion, it would give us an exit strategy that allows us to maintain the value of our Bitcoins while entering a sidechain.  The implications of this are very important for the future of Bitcoin and Freedom.  It would create a lot more confidence in the Bitcoin infrastructure, because it would make it much more robust against any kind of centralized attack.
Edit: added about 2-way peg

With mobile wallets, you can use the phones camera to scan a QR code and import the address.  Its much easier than manually punching it in.
Its not really a good idea to transfer a mobile wallet to a computer.  If you have the same wallet on 2 devices it can sometimes cause some errors. Which Android wallet are you using?  Most Android wallets use HD wallets, and the backup is often in the form of a 12 word seed list. It is this reason it probably won't work with a Bitcoin Core type of client.
If you want a PC wallet, you should download a new one and create new private keys, then send the coins from your mobile wallet to the PC wallet. Check out some of the different [wallets]( here.  
I suggest downloading [electrum]( for a PC.  Just write down your 12 word seed for backup.
The advantage of [electrum]( or [multibit]( is you do not have to download the whole blockchain which can take 3 days as with [Bitcoin Core]( the original client.

Sounds like a really cool idea.  Maybe it could be tweaked slightly here or there to have a better effect.  For example, I would suggest thinking about getting rid of the queen altogether, and have the adversary be not one figure.  Have the adversary be men in black masks with guns and black vehicles, or just a group of people who make up the state and blindly follow orders from an invisible entity. 
In your current version, I don't like that in the end, the queen is still in charge. It should end with the people in charge, the men in black masks throwing down their guns and revealing their human faces, to join humanity in Bitcoin freedom.

Well yes there are many security issues to think about with bitcoin.  Your level of security is up to you and probably depends on how many bitcoins you have.  It depends on how well you trust those sharing it with. You can encrypt the wallet with a password.  You can also look into paperwallets like at [bitaddress.org]( , and look into [cold storage](  Also there are hardware wallets like [trezor]( which allow you to spend from a small USB device with a screen and two buttons, and it keeps it safe from hackers.

Gavin is cool, but if the Bitcoin Foundation no longer existed, Gavin wouldn't disappear.  Organizations become corrupted over time.

My advice is you probably don't want to mine. Its a big mistake, most new people want to mine at first. Mining is an extremely competitive game these days and is not really profitable for small timers or beginners.  In the old days you could mine on your laptop and get 50 bitcoins easily.  Today the difficulty has risen and ASICs have been built which make it a bad idea to try to mine for small timers.  If you want to do it as merely a hobby I would say go for it though.

Of course they will try to ruin it, government ruins everything ;)  But at the end of the day they cant completely stop bitcoin, they can just make things inconvenient.  If they try to make it illegal for businesses to accept then yeah it would suck, but if we are loud enough we can stop it.  We the people still have some power to resist.  
Even if it is made totally illegal, bitcoin will continue.  There will be jurisdictions where it is allowed.  They made marijuana illegal and forbid businesses from selling it, but how successful were they?  When they made it illegal the price or marijauna soared to very high levels.  If they make bitcoin illegal, it still does not affect bitcoin's ability to be a store of wealth, safe-haven from government seizure, etc...  If they make it illegal, probably it will go down at first, then the price will go up same as drug prices go up when they become illegal.  They made eagle feathers illegal too, and now they sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars per feather.

21 million is an arbitrary number.  Satoshi Nakamoto once said something along the lines of "it seemed like a good number".  Its meant to be limited similar to gold or precious metals.  
Satoshi likened it to precious metals in this way because it is scarce:
"As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: boring grey in colour, not a good conductor of electricity, not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either, not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose, and one special, magical property: can be transported over a communications channel. If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it. Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you’ve suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it." -Satoshi Nakamoto, 2010

He means the block reward halving. When bitcoin started, the block reward was 50 BTC per block, or 50 BTC were produced every 10 minutes.  In 2012 that number halved to 25 BTC per 10 minutes.  In 2016 it will halve again and only 12.5 BTC will be issued per 10 minute block.  It will keep halving every 4 years until no more bitcoins are produced leaving the number less than 21 million BTC.
Edit: Also right now there are about 3,600 BTC mined per day, and about 1.3 million BTC being mined per year.  This means the annual inflation right now is about 10%.  We are still in the distribution phase of Bitcoin, which is likely why the price is still low.  People are scoopin as many coins as they can, because in the future that inflation rate will drop significantly.  Also when considering that probably many of the current 13 million BTC in existence have been lost or destroyed forever, the annual inflation is probably a lot higher than 10%.  This is keeping the price down temporarily.

I agree, but from my understanding sidechains will actually protect against centralization of Bitcoin.  Sidechains will provide a platform for innovation and competition in a decentralized free market.  So if the main Bitcoin chain becomes centralized people can exit into a sidechain, while preserving their bitcoin's value.  
In a way sidechains take Bitcoin's decentralization one order of magnitude larger.  What I mean by that is as it stands now we have decentralization between bitcoin and alt-coins.  But if sidechains were implemented, we would have further decentralization within Bitcoin itself. Sidechains seems like it will be checkmate to any regulators trying to stop Bitcoin.

Definitely a good warning I agree.  I probably wouldn't trust this bitcoinpaperwallet.com with significant amounts.  I don't think it has been around for very long.  If I had to choose, I would at least use bitaddress.org because they have been around longer.  Has really nobody audited the code properly at bitaddress either?  At least if there was a serious exploit like the brainwallet.org case then you would probably read some horror stories by now.


Could you elaborate on this?  What about using a Bitcoin-QT/Bitcoin Core client on a bootable ubuntu operating system?  Are the keys created with this RNG secure?  I know some smartphones had poor RNG or entropy in the past and people got some coins stolen.
Also what about Trezor?  Are we sure Trezor RNG and entropy is significantly secure?

It is all part of the distribution.  We are in the distribution phase for bitcoins, and the price peak and crash were both needed to get new users and investors to take the plunge into the system.
If $339 was an all time high, a lot of people would shy away, because nobody wants to buy at an all time high.  But since we hit $1200ish and now the price is much lower, it feels like a bargain to those newbies coming into the game.
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:14:12

Perhaps you have a point, and I am not ruling out the possibility that an alt-coin could replace Bitcoin.  Although this becomes much less likely with the implementation of [sidechains](  But the guy in the video along with others think that no decentralized currency will work.  They are also very rude and ignorant, as well as insulting to Bitcoiners.  They think the Blockchain will be adapted by FIAT currencies and governments.  However it is hard to see how the incentive system would work for a FIAT only blockchain. I can more easily see how it would work if a FIAT system was implemented on top of Bitcoin or another decentralized currency. Either way by completely ruling out Bitcoin the currency, it shows their small mindedness.

There are many types of [wallets](  Changetip acts as a wallet for you once your link your reddit account. You should try out some other wallets too.

The advantage of [electrum]( or [multibit]( is you do not have to download the whole blockchain which can take 3 days as with [Bitcoin Core]( the original client.  Also for more security look into [cold storage]( and [paper wallets](  Also look into hardware wallets like [Trezor]( which keep your keys safe on an external device, but still allow you to spend from them.  [This]( wallet is pretty good for Android, and [bread wallet]( is good for i-phone.  Mycelium also seems widely recommended.
To send coins around you will have to find one of your public key addresses.  They always begin with a 1, unless they are mutli-signature addresses.  Just go to one wallet type/paste the address of another wallet you control or service, and choose amount and click send.  Its as easy as that.

Ohh but to answer your question, you will go into the store, and when you pay they will probably have a QR code somewhere for you to scan.  You scan the code with your phone's camera to import the address, then you send the amount of bitcoin to the address.  They will confirm the payment and then its done.  Some places may make you wait for confirmations on the network to protect against double spends.
Also another popular way to buy things with bitcoin in retail stores is to use the [gyft]( ap.  You can use bitcoin to purchase gift cards at many places that don't normally accept Bitcoin, like Whole Foods, Home Depot, Burger King, etc.. I believe the gift card exists on your phone and the register person will scan the gift card at time of purchase.

What if government stopped enforcing traffic laws?  Do you think it would be chaos?  How can you know for sure?  Also, maybe there are free market solutions that can keep us safer than governments.  Imagine if roads were privately maintained.  There could be a market of competition in how to regulate roads and rules of the road.  If you don't like the way one road enforces their rules, use a different road.
Imagine all of the technology the private sector and free market produces.  None of it is allowed on the roadways.  You can't have smart cars that drive themself.  You can't have innovation and safety solutions provided by a free market.  The roads are not safer, there are huge accidents and deaths all of the time.  What if we had buck rogers technology and were allowed to innovate for roadways and vehicles?  That tech is here already, yet governments only slow it down and get in the way.

Its all part of the distribution phase of Bitcoins.  Some people criticize Bitcoin for having unfair distribution.  However an [MIT study]( showed that bitcoin is more likely to be spent than hoarded.  This is what is leading to the current high volatility.

I have seen countless threads recently about people claiming they got into it and got their first wallet because of recent tips.  So that right there is pretty strong evidence.
Yes a rising price will encourage faster adoption, but adoption also begets a price rise.  Imagine when Satoshi first was spreading bitcoins, the price was nothing at that time.  It took the user adoption of the currency to preceed the price rise.  So that is evidence right there that user adoption is first needed before a price rise. Then they both become feed back loops reinforcing each other.

Valid point, although its hard to judge how serious of a problem that is in a 9 seat cash ring game.  Also for Pot Limit Omaha this vulnerability is much worse than in Texas Holdem.  It may be not be worth it/not profitable to try this collusion tactic in Texas Holdem.
Also it is worth noting that this issue would not matter much for tournament games, especially larger tournaments.  Even single table tournament sit and go's would be very difficult to exploit with this method.  Double or Nothing tournaments would be more vulnerable.  But as more tables are added to a tournament, this issue becomes less worrisome.
Also there could be some sort of web of trust to keep players in check.  Even on the current sites, collusion is an issue, but many times it is the community in the 2 + 2 forums that catch the cheaters and colluders.

I see Bitcoin and crypto-currencies as very important for the future of humanity.  The reasons are so numerous, that it may be impossible to list them all without hours of thought.  For one it is permissionless.  As more and more prohibitions and capital controls are used to strangle the economy, people are going to adapt.  More and more things are being prohibited, and the rise of decentralized marketplaces like Open Bazaar and Bitcoin will allow people to more easily sell things like light bulbs that will soon be [prohibited and phased out](
With FIAT money your bank account can be shut down by banks, or by government pressure.  The [IRS is seizing]( people's money when they haven't even been accused of a crime.  Our bank accounts are not safe.  If you carry cash while driving down the highway [your are not safe]( from the police stealing your money even when you have not been accused of a crime.  Bitcoin allows you to keep your money encrypted and safe from government thieves.
The banker bailouts in 2008, and the bail-ins in places like Cyprus show how vulnerable the FIAT money system is.  It shows how corrupt and captured regulators are. The Fed has [tripled the money supply]( since 2008.  Bitcoin is a fair and honest system, and its only a matter of time before sound money is adopted.  Good money will chase out the bad.
The real story of Bitcoin's future as others have noted is "the other 6 billion'.  Most people in the world are unbanked and have no access to banking services.  This is a severe economic barrier.  But now we have the spread of cheap smartphones all over the world, and even in places with no running water you can find people with smartphones.  Bitcoin gives you the ability to put a bank on your phone, and we never had that before.  This is going to change things in ways we can't yet imagine.
One of the things that excites me about Bitcoin is that it neuters the state.  The state and the central banks get a lot of their power and ability to wage giant wars from their abilitty to print money out of thin air.  Now that we have Bitcoin and sound money options, it will require the state power and monopolies to shrink and be less powerful.  This smaller government will be a boon to economic freedom, production, and prosperity.

I think its a good time to buy.  We may go a bit lower to $250 temporarily.  If you are going to buy a significant amount of bitcoins, then you really need to secure them.  Keeping them in a hot or online wallet is a recipe for disaster.  This is how many people lost all of their coins, because they stupidly trusted MtGox with all their coins.  Don't trust anyone with your keys except yourself.  
Learn about the different types of [wallets](  The [Bitcoin Core]( wallet is the main wallet, but requires you to download the entire blockchain, which can take 3 days and take up significant space on your hard drive.  For a lightweight and easier experience I suggest [electrum]( wallet.  They will give you a 12 word seed phrase that can be used to backup your wallet.  Write it down and don't lose it or your coins are lost forever.
Learn about [cold storage](  Look into hardware wallets like [Trezor](  Or learn about paper wallets.

I think its wrong to do your measurements in dollars. The richest people also are not on the Forbes list, they know how to hide their wealth. You should be measuring actual wealth instead meaning physical assets, as well as purchasing power.  The whole idea is if Bitcoin truly succeeds it will not just be 100,000 or 1 million dollar per bitcoin.  The end result is dollar collapse similar to Zimbabwe dollars.  As it collapses the richest ones now will be exiting furiously from worthless dollars to real money such as Bitcoins.
Also it is not just wealth that is in existence right now that matters.  With dollars what really matters is the potential to create as much wealth as you want thru FIAT printing, and steal wealth from others in a hidden tax of inflation.  This is where the imbalance comes from.

I also wonder how much of the inflation is negated by VCs or big investors scooping up all of the freshly mined coins from mining pools/farms.  
Perhaps much of the inflation is already worked into the price since investors can buy up the coins before they even exist.

One risk is volatility risk.  The price of Bitcoin fluctuates greatly depending on market conditions.  This can be a good thing when its going up and bad when its going down.  Another risk is there is a non-zero chance of a catostrophic failure where Bitcoin dies.
Other risks are security risks, or mistakes made by the user.  For example when sending from a wallet, some users lost funds because they didn't understand [change addresses](  Beginners don't understand things like backing up your wallet, or keeping your private key secure.
Also if you are looking for security of your wallets, look into [cold storage]( or paper wallets.  Also there are hardware wallets like [Trezor]( which are designed to keep your bitcoin's safe as well as easily spendable.
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:54:01
Ohh nice, you must be using Bitcoin Core wallet.  That is the original wallet, but the downside is it takes so long to download the blockchain.  There are lighter weight versions like Electrum and Multibit, which don't require downloading the whole blockchain.
Make sure to back-up your wallet.  In Bitcoin Core to back it up you go to file and then go to "backup wallet".  Then save it to USB or some external device.  With Bitcoin Core you should backup your wallet frequently.  Generally 1 backup is good for 100 transactions I have heard.  With newer HD wallets, you only need to back it up once.  With electrum they give a 12-word seed that serves as your backup, and you only need to do it once.

I don't want to take the wealth away from those scammers either in a forceful way.  Give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.  But the transfer of wealth will happen voluntarily through the market.

Sidechains don't make alt-coins illegal.  Sidechains aren't being invented to kill altcoins.  Your post is hypocritical.  You accuse Bitcoiners of being a cartel who want to secure their investment by implementing sidechains to prevent alt-coins from competing.  Yet you admit you are an alt-coin investor, therefore you are trying to stop sidechains to protect your own investment.  Highly hypocritical.  In fact Bitcoiners aren't even doing what you accuse them of, but you are doing the exact same thing you accuse Bitcoiners of doing.

Those bitcoins coming on the market will have an effect.  But it won't be that much of an effect compared to the yearly inflation.  This year alone about 1.3 million coins will be produced.  I believe the Silk Road case is still holding about 175,000 BTC.  That amount gets mined ever 50 days.
However, many of the coins that will be mined in the future are already being locked up by VC's with contracts to buy them from the big mining firms.
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:53:30
Ok so it got hacked, but it didnt affect anything.  The bug was simply patched and things continued smoothly, and barely anyone noticed.  So even if Bitcoin gets hacked, the ledger will continue on and be unaffected.  So hacking the system is therefore not much threat to Bitcoin, good to know.
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:16:05
Bitcoin is a really complex and new technology.  There is no easy answer to your question and it can lead down a lot of different tangents.  Basically Bitcoin is a public ledger, and transactions are locked into that ledger about every 10 minutes on average. 
Bitcoin has a very intrictate incentive system that allows the system to work.  The miners secure the network and verify transactions and lock them into the ledger by finding blocks.  As the processing power increases on the network the difficulty adjusts so that blocks are found on average every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:06:55
Also with electrum, to back up your wallet write down the 12 word seed they give you and don't lose it.  Since it is an HD wallet, you only have to back it up one time.

There are many ways to get it.  You can receive tips here.  More and more people are doing work for bitcoin compensation, but this is usually development and programming work.  Some writers for Bitcoin media sites get paid in bitcoin also.  Some websites accept Bitcoin as payment, such as Overstock.com, dell.com, newegg, tigerdirect, Expedia, 1-800-flowers, etc..  
You can buy bitcoins in many places depending on your location.  In America, coinbase.com, and circle.com are two good places to buy and sell using a bank account.  You can use localbitcoins.com to find others to buy and sell bitcoins as well using a variety of methods.
To use bitcoin there are many options for [wallets]( and yes some are similar to banks.  But the beauty of Bitcoin, is it allows you to be your own bank if you want to. This way you don't have to trust anybody except yourself, and the trustless Bitcoin network. Use a wallet like [Bitcoin-qt/Bitcoin Core]( if you don't mind downloading the whole blockchain.  If you want a lighter weight client try [electrum]( or [multi-bit]( wallet.  You can also have mobile wallets like [bread wallet]( for I-phone, or the blockchain ap.  Also [this wallet]( is good for Android.

Don't expect regulation to ever fix anything.  The cause of all these problems was the regulation, and regulatory capture.

Yeah QR code on stage is the best thing I can think of.  One other possibility is if you and your band members need to decide on how to spend funds on new equipment and stuff.  For security and to avoid disputes and promote agreement, you could create a multi-signature wallet.  Then you will need 2 of 3, or 3 of 4, or 4 of 5 signatures in order to spend the funds.  Also you can have more accountability as all transactions can be viewed on the blockchain.
Edit:  One way to do multi-sig is with [bitaddress.org]( paper wallets using split wallet option.

Cool, I have seen recently people argue that sidechains would cause the blockchain to bloat to be too big in size.

I would have them even pose as business people or programmers looking to create a start-ups.  I would have my agents go on Localbitcoins.com and have them meetup to trade with Bitcoiners.

Yeah he basically says that Bitcoin will become centralized due to mining and Ghash controlling 51%.  I think he didn't address that miners can leave a mining pool anytime.

Seems like the word maximalism is made to make proponents of sidechains look bad and greedy.  I don't think sidechainers want a monopoly for Bitcoin at all. We don't want to reduce competition at all.  On the contrary we want increased competition and innovation.
Yet it seems Vitalik has a lot to gain by preventing sidechains on Bitcoin, as perhaps it would threaten the value of his Ethereum project.

When setting up electrum, you will generate a 12-word seed. All you have to do is write it down and don't lose it.  If you lose the seed your coins are gone forever.

Yeah I see your point. Perhaps there are many different types of centralized attack.  One that I can think of is by centralization of miners.  You may be correct that sidechains would offer no benefit against this attack.  Although I still wonder for example what if mining became centralized by giant ASIC operations?  Then what if a sidechain could implement a new algorithm that is ASIC resistant and people could switch to it? Could a sidechain ever become the main chain? I am not too sure how the mining of sidechains would work.
But the other centralized attack I can think of would be by the main developers of Bitcoin.  What if they got pressured and implemented things into the Bitcoin protocol that Libertarians or others didn't like? Instead of a fork which could really hurt the network, we could simply move to a sidechain instead, while preserving our bitcoin value. You could always move back to the main chain at any time, meaning the sidechain coins would have a minimum value of the bitcoin on the main chain.  Would sidechains protect against this type of centralized attack?  Or they still offer no benefit? 
Maybe stupid questions.  Sidechains on the surface seem to me to be incredibly important, trying to understand if I am overestimating their importace or not.

If you were using a hot wallet on your computer, you would want to atleast backup your wallet onto a USB or onto paper or another method.  It varies a lot depending on what kind of wallet you choose.  If you have a file with a private key you can always restore the coins to a new wallet.  With Bitcoin Core client its a little inconvenient to restore the wallet.dat backup file.  But with a client like Electrum which uses an HD seed, you can back-up your wallet with a simple 12 word seed list and transfer it to a new device easily. 
You can look at many of the existing wallets [here](  
I suggest downloading [electrum]( for a PC.  Just write down your 12 word seed for backup.
Another option is [multibit]( Also you can try [Bitcoin Core]( the original client but Bitcoin Core client can take up to 3 days to download the blockchain.  Electrum and multibit are lightweight clients and don't require that.
Also if you really want security of your Bitcoins then look into [cold storage]( and [paper wallets](  Also find out about hardware wallets like [Trezor]( which keep your keys safe on an external device, but still allow you to spend from them.  
You can check out some mobile wallets too. [This]( wallet is pretty good for Android, and [bread wallet]( is good for i-phone.  [Airbitz]( also seems like a cool new wallet.  It also  has a business directory.  [Mycelium]( also seems widely recommended, and I hear it has a local trader option as well to find people to buy and sell bitcoins in your area..

I like this idea.  If Bitcoin were adopted by a small country, then it would be considered legal tender by the IRS, thus more certainly not subject to capital gains taxes when spent.
Here is a [quote by the IRS]( remember this is only their guidance and "opinion" that Bitcoin is not currency and it may not hold up in court anyways:


Therefore if Bitcoin were adopted as legal tender in some country OR jurisdiction it would certainly be considered currency by IRS opinion.

I haven't used the android wallet.  But I believe its an HD wallet, meaning that it is backed up by a seed.  Usually the seed is in the form of a 12 or 24 word-list. To back-up your wallet just write down the words, and don't lose them. Although I think it can be saved in other forms like numerically, or a QR code.  
With HD wallet seeds, you only need to back-up your wallet one time.  Other wallets like Bitcoin Core, which doesn't use HD yet, result in having to back-up your wallet after every transaction (or 100 transactions).

Ok cool, yeah Bitcoin Core is great to use, as long as you don't mind the wait to download the whole blockchain.  Yes you will go to file and then click backup wallet, and save the wallet.dat to a secure location like USB flash drive.  Remember that with Bitcoin Core, you should back up your transactions repeatedly.  They say one backup is good for 100 transactions on Bitcoin Core I think, but I just back mine up after every transaction to be safe.  The wallet.dat contains all of your private keys for that wallet to date.  Every public address is associated with a different private key.
With newer HD wallets, it only requires one backup, called a seed, in which all of the public/private keys are derived from the same seed.

Mostly the price just went up so high because there was a little bit too much exuberance.  Large holders then sold off some of their stash to buy a new house, new car, new girlfriend, etc...The price went back down.  
This happened many times in the past.  It first spiked to 30 dollars then crashed down to like 1 or 2 dollars.  Then it went to 266 then crashes down to about 60 dollars.  This last bubble went to about 1100-1200 now it crashed down and reached 275 briefly at one point.  
Likely there will be another bubble in the next year or two where the price goes much higher, say 5,000 or 8,000.  Then it will crash back down to 3,000 or so.  Over time it will keep happening but the volatility will be reduced each time as large holders sell off some of their holdings. Once the Bitcoins are more evenly distributed and more widely accepted you will see the volatility go down and see it act more like a regular currency.

Another downside is that if you store it with them you don't have control over your own money.  They could lose it or get hacked, or their service goes down temporarily or permanently. They could lend the money out without you knowing. The government could shut them down and seize the money. 
In order to comply with regulations they may freeze your funds, and ask you a million questions and investigate you and invade your privacy. You may want to send funds, but can't because their site is getting DDoS'ed.  These are just some downsides that come to mind.
Although its a small amount now, remember at one time 1 Bitcoin traded for just 10 cents.  It peaked at $1200ish and now its at $328.

If we want to preserve the Libertarian ideals of bitcoin, and preserve freedom and promote innovation, it seems side-chains are what we need.  
It would create a decentralized exchange mechanism and allow us to change our bitcoins into side chains that allow new features like privacy, anonymity, micro transactions, faster confirmation times etc.  Also since there would be a 2-way peg you could easily switch back and forth into bitcoin, meaning your sidechain coins would not lose value, they would retain the same value as Bitcoin.  Bitcoin would essentially become the reserve currency for all other cryptos on the sidechains.  
The sidechains would be backed by not only Bitcoin's value, but also by Bitcoin's hashing network.  This would boost the price of bitcoin significantly as well.  It provides a way out, and an escape plan in case Bitcoin becomes co-opted.  I believe side-chains would also be important for helping Bitcoin to scale larger.
It seems like a good idea for the community to get behind this and have it implemented into the core protocol before its too late.  The longer we wait and the more Bitcoin matures, the harder it is to get revolutionary ideas like this implemented.

Welcome! We are still in the very early adopter phase in my humble opinion.
Bitpay and Coinbase provide useful services for merchants accepting Bitcoin.  But if you are only receiving a few payments you can just get yourself a secure wallet.  [Here]( you can check out the different wallets.  
Try to choose a wallet where you don't have to trust anyone to hold your private keys.  Always backup your wallet and try to keep any hot wallets on a secure device.  I suggest downloading [electrum]( for a PC.  Just write down your 12 word seed for backup.
Another option is [multibit]( Also you can try [Bitcoin Core]( the original client but Bitcoin Core client can take up to 3 days to download the blockchain.  Electrum and multibit are lightweight clients and don't require that.
Also for more security look into [cold storage]( and [paper wallets](  Also find out about hardware wallets like [Trezor]( which keep your keys safe on an external device, but still allow you to spend from them.  
There are mobile wallets too. [This]( wallet is pretty good for Android, and [bread wallet]( is good for i-phone.  [Mycelium]( also seems widely recommended, and I hear it has a local trader option as well to find people to buy and sell bitcoins in your area..  Hopefully some of these links will help you out.

Yes download your own wallet.  Don't trust web wallets or third parties to hold your coins very long.  Hold your own private keys as much as possible.  I suggest [electrum]( because it is lightweight and doesn't require to download the whole blockchain.  It will give you a 12 word seed phrase when you set it up.  Write down the seed and don't lose it.  If you lose the word list you lose your coins.

No thats not what change addresses are. [Change addresses]( are when say you have 1 bitcoin at address 14kmf9o4jUYHBKI03kdj083jJOL33.  Then you send 0.7 BTC to some new address here 1HaXAyCx1sVd4YVbxLd2dTc3kNBAy59Eos. Almost all wallets will create a new output address as well for the remaining 0.3 BTC called a change address.  And 0 will be left in the original address.
So you will be left with 3 address, the original with 0 BTC, and two new addresses with 0.7 and 0.3 respectively.

@_date: 2014-11-17 23:06:51
Not sure what happened, but you have a very small output of only 344 satoshis, so that likely has something to do with it.  Miners don't like to accept blocks with very small outputs, although usually when adding a fee I would think it would get accepted.  Perhaps the fee was not large enough, but I am really not sure.
Usually after time, I think if no miners accept the transaction it gets removed from the mempool, and the coins returned to you.  Then you can send a new transaction, try not to include any small outputs.  Perhaps send the entire contents of the address or raise the fee to ensure it gets into a block next time.
If you are in a hurry you can possibly extract the private key and then create a raw transaction to broadcast to the network with larger fee, or with no small outputs.  Basically it is a form of double spending.
@_date: 2014-11-15 02:26:38
I would worry about a snitch society where people are spying on their neighbors and reporting them similar to Nazi Germany.  This is already happening all over America with things like [InfraGard](

Many Bitcoiners don't "want something out of people" the way you buttcoiners do.  We have a vision for a better world that uses sound and honest money.  We want to educate and awaken others to the power of Bitcoin.  We want others to adopt sound money so they can stop getting scammed and stop living in debt and poverty because this affects everyone, including our children's futures.
Maybe since you have a public sector job you are more interested in tyranny and debt money, rather than freedom, prosperity, and sound money.  Since you so obviously have a mentality that "everyone wants something out of everyone else", it shows your character.  You are not interested in a better world, you are content to suck off of everyone else and get what you can.
The OP's father is the one making a claim that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme.  That is a very severe accusation and it better be backed up with proof.  I am happy to call the Federal Reserve FIAT system a scam system, and am ready to back it up on a moments notice with a giant list of facts and truths.

Its hard to trust a company to do this, because they could steal the private keys and then take the coins later.
Its best to do it on your own using [Bitaddress]( you can print paper wallets.  Move your mouse around to make an address.  Then select paper wallet option.  Then use the BIP 38 option to put a password on the wallets if you want.  The BIP 38 password encrypted wallets will be blue color, the regular ones are without password.  Try to do it on a secure computer or offline computer if possible.
I have noticed the paper wallets are a little small when I print them, so if anyone has suggestions on how to print them bigger i would like to know.

There are some scalability issues, but these will probably be solved when they actually become problems.  I heard Andreas Antonopoulos answer these questions before.

They said it would never play video, etc...But all these problems were solved in time.
With Moore's Law processing power, and storage are becoming easier and easier.  Our ability to store data is probably going to keep outpacing the growth of the blockchain size.
