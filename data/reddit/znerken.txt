look at  answer. It's not fees, but damn currency converting. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:48:14
It’s so hard to know anything these days about BTC, but I will fucking hodl. Hope it reaches McAffee’s theories. Damn Coinbase, I transferred more money days ago cause I wanted to invest more at the next dip, but Coinbase is slow as...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:50:25
Would you recommend using GDAX instead of Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:47:43
Today we will separate men from boys. Hodl!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:37:10
Ah, thanks for the correction. Buying bitcoins at night is probably best then.. Is it okay to be in the eur market, or should I try to switch?
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:59:26
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:27:22
To rephrase the question in a hunt for a serious discussion, why is the price increasing slower these last three days even though futures happened?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:12:16
What, I thought it was Sunday 00:01? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:55:48
This is my opinion as well.. On the other side, cold storing your own keys also gives certain risks? I feel people often don't mention the negative side of cold storing keys. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:48:27
I guess, I can turn it the other way if I ever want to sell? I can sell at those EUR spikes, and get more..?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:40:46
Any theories to why this insane dip is happening?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:30:31
&lt;3 thank you..
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:49:56
Any release date for lightning? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:06:52
Why is the price you get when you click BUY on Coinbase so much higher than the bitcoin price on the dashboard? WTF?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:30:48
Is there any place you can see the direct relationship between sells/purchases per hour/minute/seconds w/e?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:48:08
What's FOMO?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:43:14
Silly question, but if it drops to lower than 12k instantly, I will get the BTC price at that second, not the 12k I wrote? Say it would drop to 10k for 2 secs for example.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:09:17
To drive the price up? What an ass
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:39:42
Haha, touché. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:32:19
What is happening to Coinbase? Did a SEPA transfer like 21st of December, and still hasn’t arrived??
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:37:42
Yep, transfer the 1 BTC you lost :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:41
Parts of europe...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:30:48
_this_ is what I thought. But why does coinbase force you to deal in euro? That's just stupid. You introduce a second risk.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:34:24
Would people recommend other alternatives to coinbase, or are coinbase in fact an pretty OK service to use? I mean, long term.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:43:35
I want BTC to reach the sky!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:41:19
Hodling. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:28:38
If I click buy bitcoin now on Coinbase, as of this second, they say 13,542.51 at the homepage. When the buying page come up it says €14,125.14. What kind of scam is Coinbase pulling here?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:52:41
Would you care to explain this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:24:59
It says 7 EURO in fees, that still doesn't add up?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:48:35
I just want upward swings.. Take your downward swings elsewhere, sir!
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:58:01
Even with the futures?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:54:26
Ah, of course. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:51:22
I can't see a view of the relationship between how many.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:29:42
Ye, but why do they have one buying price, and one value price? Why is the buying price always way higher than the front page value price?? I was in a rush, the sweat was dripping... I had to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:52:06
Does BTC usually stabilize in the weekend like this weekend? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:52:03
Before people go berserk. The BTC is only 500 lower on the euro market than it was at yesterdays lowest point. RELAX! HODL
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:03:38
Is it really _that_ important storing your bitcoins in a wallet, instead of Gdax, Coinbase etc.? If so, why?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:40:31
I just wanted to confirm that I understand this graph.
The numbers on the vertical line represents number of orders, right? So according to the graph, more people are selling right now? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:27:09
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:00:21
You can use CB for now, imo.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:33:17
Am I the only one a little disappointed on how Futures affected BTC? That wasn't either the downfall or the up people talked about for weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:25:56
I know, so I should've made money in total.. Instead, when I check, I bought BTC at an higher price 5 hours ago, than they are now..  Also, I HATE coinbase for forcing me to use EURO. Who uses euro!?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:51:20
Are we ever going to see a dip below 10k again? I have invested a little, but I want to invest more... Can I wait for 10k, or should I just get in at 12-13k?
It’s so sad to calculate how much of a rise is needed to be one of those “I bought a car/house” people. Just owning 0.5 BTC is insane now, and for 0.5 BTC to be a lot of $, it has to raise insanely high. RIP bad decisions in the past...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:39:31
0.01 then...
