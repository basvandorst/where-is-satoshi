No, there can be nodes that are exchanges that pump liquidity back into the system. So you can Bitcoins from exchanges directly on the lightning network.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:23:54
Here's also a simulation of a Lightning Network with an "X" node at the bottom being an exchange that provides liquidity for the whole network:

Their slack channel is also nice if you want to talk directly to the devs: 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:37:44
The fee is paid by the person that initiated the channel (hence the customer)
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:41:51
These are single-funded channels. When the channels get closed the fee for the "closing transaction" will be paid by the customer.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:32:53
He thinks these lightning hubs will be like banks. I disagree. The main difference is that if you don't trust the hub, you can leave at anytime, to another hub (if hubs will even ever exist). This freedom of choice is exactly what decentralization gives us.

So much hype for a technology that will, in my opinion, totally under-~~promise~~deliver.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:40:39
One thing to note is that "recharging" an exhausted channel will be difficult because LN doesn't really work well for transferring lots of money. So you can only send as much as the routing allows - probably little since users will not want to route your huge recharge payment because it will then also exhaust their channels. Quite tricky.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:43:17
Can't we get the nice interface  to work for mainnet?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:23
But how can they relay stuff for me if I don't have channels open with these "watching nodes"?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:36:26
But that would require another $30 (in fee) bitcoin transaction :(
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:04:55
Well, theoretically if you open a channel with a node that is online all the time (say a big company), you never need to close the channel; you simply relay all your payments through that node. So that's a single transaction, for all your  payments in the future -- you only close the channel (hence another transaction) when someone misbehaves, but nobody ever will because they will lose all their money if they do so.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:14:33
Would it be possible to setup using a scenario where the number of nodes making payments will always outweigh the nodes receiving them? This seems like a more realistic scenario.
In other words, most payments in LN will go into specific nodes (say, Amazon or Ebay). The majority of payments we make are not towards our friends, but towards big entities that sell stuff.
My concern is that a route may be harder to find if the typology of the network pushes all the money towards these specific areas of the graph -- we might end up with not many routing possibilities because most channels in a route might be exhausted in that direction.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:22
But then I need to open a channel with someone that doesn't go offline. If they go offline I can't relay my payment. How will that work?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:47:42
The payment processor would have to have a huge quantity of coins locked up in order to accomodate such demand of opened channels.

The software used to run your moms dildo is open source and i contribute to it daily.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:55:29
The problem I'm talking about comes with routing, which requires, by definition, money to flow towards the destination of your payee. In Bitcoin there's no concept of finding routes and having all the hops exchange money with each other so this problem doesn't present itself.
I think we can sit here and discuss how this can work or not work all day. Since there's a simulator (which I don't know how to use) I was simply asking whether such scenario can be tested so we can see for ourselves how the network behaves in this scenario.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:33:12
Hi Jim, big fan of your work. May I ask why you guys decided to go for this "fee to developers" option? Don't you think developers do what they do because they love it, and not because of an economical retribution (at least that's why I do it)? Also, wouldn't developers of mainstream bitcoin wallets have a pretty easy time finding a really good paying job? Furthermore, may I ask what percentage of software, that you use daily, is open-source and free to use?
Sorry if these seem kind of provocative sort of questions but I promise I am just truly interested in knowing your rationale. I could imagine if you were competing in a software category (perhaps videogames, or operating systems) where you must charge for your software. However, the bitcoin software market is pretty much as free and open-source as it gets.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:24:55
No, no and no. Open-source is successful for the very reason that it doesn't pay developers. Adding money to it sort of poisons the entire community which is about doing stuff because they want to do it and not for some economical retribution. After all, if you're the head developer of a mainstream bitcoin wallet, easy cash shouldn't be an issue for you.

Satoshi also alluded to this in the paper: "Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.".  This essentially means that Satoshi didn't expect everyone to run full nodes.

How is knowledge in academia not decentralized? Sure there's bureaucracy and dullness, but it still provides solid infrastructure and is full of unorthodox scientists willing to push the envelope in whichever direction. It's true that if you have a good idea, you can do it outside of academia no problem. But if you're truly interested in the scientific part - experiments, theories, etc. - then the academic community will certainly do more good than harm!

Why is Bitcoin Magazine mentioning p2pool.org then? 
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:50:55
I think it's because mining P2Pool requires you to keep a copy of the entire blockchain. Mining centralized pools doesn't. This is a barrier to entry in my opinion. Miners want a plug-and-play solution. P2Pool doesn't really give you that if you need to download 20gb of data before you start mining.

That's a bad analogy in my opinion. It's more like trying to explain the invention of the Web saying that it could do a whole lot more than publishing documents. Sure it can, but you wouldn't be explaining the Web in the early 2000s as a technology for doing chat-communication. No, you would concentrate on the publishing documents part. Especially if it's someone that didn't understand what the Web was!
My idea is that we need to concentrate on the currency part because lots of people still don't even get that.

Great talk but if there's a flaw in ECDSA in Bitcoin ([26:46]( then everyone would lose their money.

This is only using Bitcoin for the domain registration part. The rest of the tool is unrelated to Bitcoin. It's essentially a web-browser, but instead of downloading the HTML of the site from a single HTTP server, it uses the BitTorrent protocol to download the HTML from a variety of different nodes. 
So it's like sharing an HTML file using BitTorrent, but the final download seamlessly downloads and renders the content just like a normal browser. Benefit is that there's no central server. The HTML comes from many different peers.

For people selling bitcoins this is an extremely simple solution which requires very little maintenance: no electricity, no internet required. You could simply load the machine with paper wallets containing specific amounts in bitcoins. Given the volatility you could adjust the content of the wallets since you have the private keys.
For people buying bitcoins, this is a quick solution to get your first coins. Also perhaps for people needing some quick bitcoins, given that these can be installed virtually anywhere, you could easily find them in many different places.
These are cheap and easy to install with low maintenance and less security issues since no software is needed. I'd love to see people experimenting with these sort of things. Perhaps building smaller version of this and having them go viral: installed near bus posts, chained against poles, near other typical vending machines.

While this is very cool, is there a wallet that uses multi-sig such as 2-of-3 where 2 keys are stored by me and the 3rd is stored by the wallet service?
Or even better, they keep the first one, they let me download the second, and they send me the third one via email. 
I'm wondering whether even more combinations have been tested where I don't even need to store the keys at all (regular users are bad at storing stuff). For example, a strategy where lots of file hosting services are utilized to store the keys so that I can always access my funds but they wouldn't be able to collude because they are (i) different companies and (ii) wouldn't know which keys are associated.

There's no issue here. There's no way of knowing the IP address of who generated a block. Blockchain.info might get a different IP from another node. So that IP is simply a node that is very well connected to Blockchain.info (if that's where you're getting this info from), and other nodes get some other IP. 
So in reality that IP only relayed the block, and didn't actually create it.

False. This is a common misconception as people think the branch with most blocks is accepted. Instead, the branch accepted by nodes is the one where most work was put into. Which means that as soon as a miner hits over 50%, they can decide which transactions to include in all the successive blocks. Along with all these other problems:

Given that Bitcoin is built around consensus, wouldn't it be possible to revert back to the blocks where this transaction is made? All we need is consensus for miners to do that.
Of course then all other future transactions would be invalidated. But I don't know, perhaps there's a way of reverting transactions given enough consensus, without touching future transactions.

The truth is that having a decentralized internet is slower unless you can find a way to send signals faster than fiber optic. Wireless mesh networks work in principle, but information just doesn't propagate as fast as fiber optic. And to build fiber optics you need organizations, institutions, and all that stuff.
Anyway, from a software point of view (not infrastructure), we're making things much more decentralized. For me the future is a decentralized Web (not internet). So it really won't matter who runs the infrastructure because they won't know what we'll be browsing. When that moment comes if countries/ISPs want to filter specific sites, they'll have to shut everything down because they won't be able to filter domains independently. The consequences for shutting down the entire Web for your country will probably be very negative.
Let them continue building the hard lines, and we'll find a way around it from the software side.

The problem with WebRTC is that you always need a server to get you connected to other peers, namely the website you're visiting. It's good for stuff live video/audio because the bandwidth doesn't have to reach the main server. But it's not really that good for decentralization.

It's crazy that so many altcoins think it does work. Why is that?
@_date: 2015-07-31 20:52:49
Depends. A web-browser offers a pretty secure sandbox for a website with many restrictions. In fact, the restrictions on a "tab" are far greater than what you have when you run an app on your computer. For example, the code running in such tab cannot access the data of anything other than what exists in such tab. In this sense, you'd be much safer if you'd open a malicious site rather than if you installed malicious software: they're both malicious but the one running on your computer could install trojans, key loggers, etc. The one in the browser cannot do this.
What is problematic, and perhaps the point you were trying to make, is that sensitive information must exist in the URL (such as the private key) for this concept to work. Therefore sending such information in clear text around the internet sounds like a way to lose bitcoins, I agree. 
edit: However there could be a way for a user to go an a specific URL (which doesn't contain sensitive info) and once the code on such page is loaded, it generates a priv-key, and then its public-key is somehow automatically sent to the person that gave you the earlier URL, which he can use to send bitcoins.

What's the point of this? Full nodes are useful because they allow you to independently verify the validity of the blockchain without having to trust anybody. 
If you want a lightweight alternative to access funds information and send transactions use an SPV client.

That's all really nice, but I mean, from a high-level point of view, we have a society that works because there are laws. As a democracy, which I think the US is, we've created laws and specifically even ones that people may find ridiculous. Personally there's a whole bunch of other people in jail for all kinds of reasons I think are stupid - but if my point of view would be the right one, then it wouldn't be a democracy, it would be a dictatorship.
So I think that Ross being in jail is ridiculous, but unfortunately, the majority of people don't (as the majority voted for that law). 
Fortunately the world is not all the same and we can move to different countries where the majority has voted for laws you may find more intelligent.

So you forget the passphrase, and all of this effort is worth nothing?

But what if these bodies eventually block Bitcoin's vision by stepping on its toes with various regulations and personal interests? 
To move freely into an innovative future, Bitcoin needs to remain an entire community effort. If you need promotion in the government, sure be my guest, build foundations. But the fact that the lead developer of Bitcoin is part of this lobbying doesn't really shine my day.

He is a mathematician. Some of his articles are outstandingly good. Of course not for the average joe I would say ;)

Then the attacker would only be able to double spend. They would need to continue hacking these pools in order for them to continue double-spending their own transactions. No other transactions can be touched.

I doubt it. As you can see they did it purposely to prove that their algorithm cannot easily be brute-forced. It takes a long time for each individual checkup. So even if you created a program that would check all the values described within those bounties, it would still take a very long time.

The thing you're missing is that Bitcoin is open-source. Anybody can see how it works. Since it's peer-reviewed, you can trust it for yourself. In fact, if you're a programmer, you can rebuild the system from scratch and at that point you'd only have to trust the people you're transacting with. But most non-programmers use software that is widely used and peer-reviewed that you can trust because other notable people trust it as well.

I agree. Translation would be great. I love chinese graphics!

yep you don't

Yep. Italy is probably one of the first in europe to need a system like Bitcoin. Their banks are the most corrupt in the EU

Just look at the Free Software Foundation (FSF). It's the same idea I believe. It's all about promoting our mission, the mission of Bitcoin.
