You should also understand that LN transactions ultimately will go on the blockchain whenever the LN account is closed.  The difference is multiple transactions will only be shown as one on the blockchain.  So miners still will collect fees at that time.  Think of it as hundreds of mini transactions on the LN network that get bundled in to 1 single on the main blockchain

The good news is there will be at minimum 3 full featured wallets from the get go (via ACINQ, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs).  It will take time but I could easily see it doing a decent chunk of transactions Q42018/Q22019  
Not sure what your concerns are with SPV wallets?  It is already easy as hell and definitely [usable for the average joe](  ), or no harder than any current wallet.  You could say its even more noob friendly since it has way better fee calculations

To be fair, it depends on a significant portion of current transactions to use LN.  This is why wallet adoption and education needs to be full force now.

Once again, I was talking about even before all this coffee talk.  There was once a time before all his crazy antics you know?  When all he was doing really was investing in critical infrastructure (remember bitinstant?  that service was the easiest method of getting anon BTC even today) and occasionally was interviewed on TV spreading the word.  
You don't have to vilify his entire existence just because he is batshit crazy now.  The original comment asked why people called him Bitcoin Jesus and there is a reason why literally everyone in the  community once had no issue with that.
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:38:51
If you don't remember a time when he was loved and one of the biggest proponents then you obviously have not been around long enough.  He used to be the biggest face on TV, he opened the first big store accepting only Bitcoin.  He invested heavily in infrastructure and many of the ecosystem such as blockchain.info early on.  
He has absolutely lost his way, doesn't mean we can't recognize he used to be a big and valuable voice back in the day.  His ego and need for power totally changed him.


Everything you mentioned are all well after his downfall began.

Meh, see on Gemini you just pay for your first Wire transfer then they pay the fee back and future transfers are free.  While you wait for the 3-4 days for it to go through officially they give you the amount right away you just can't move the coin out of the exchange until then.  
I do about $100 of orders once a week, paying almost %10 in fees each time is a deal breaker - more so than Segwit not yet being implemented.

My Chase account got closed a few months ago.  Previously I had been purchasing bitcoin via coinbase for about a year on a regular basis with zero issues.
The first time I had ever sold on coinbase I got a letter in the mail saying they were closing my account and would not tell me why.  It had to be the coinbase sell.
Anyways, went with my local credit union and am very happy with them.

maybe few days, maybe a week or maybe a month - there's no way to know  
but from past experience around a week or two, unless we are looking for a long term sell off like during the mtgox days - i'd say very low probability of that though.  
the market made a healthy and [steady long term climb]( to the 600 --&gt;800 level so it wouldn't be irrational to believe the final area would be around there after all is said and done.  
notice in the chart above on the right side around Jan 17 where the dip is?  there was support in the 800 area.  so again, would be rational to say we will see support around 800+ possibly 900.  
this is bitcoin we are talking about so you never know, you just have to take educated guess from knowledge you have learned from the past.  and I am not trying to act all cool and shit but I've been involved in bitcoin day trading since [late 2011/early 2012]( and have both lost and won during the many large dips over the years.  learn from your mistakes and move on.  and my gut is telling me right now is not a good time to buy unless you just want to buy and hold long term.  
I tell my friends who don't care to day trade or read charts all day to just set up an auto buy on coinbase or whatever  5-10% of your paycheck and never worry about price.  if you think bitcoin will succeed in the long run it wont matter 10 years from now what price you purchased at

You haven't seen nothin' yet.  Either you are new to the game or are living in a bubble but a correction is incoming.  
If you are new to bitcoin, please dont let posts like this lead you to go and buy more bitcoins than you could afford to lose.  The best way to invest in bitcoin is a small percentage of your paycheck each week.  Dont even look at the price.  
I guarantee we haven't seen the bottom yet

I have been trying to think up of a potential ecommerce website that only accepts bitcoins myself.  I think one thing to keep in mind is that currently bitcoin is mainly used by techy people.  techy people like games/servers/vpns/computer hardware etc.
i think that is where we should start.  i have a few ideas, maybe we could talk soon and bounce some ideas around?
i also don't want to necessarily make that much money.  I am more interested in making percentage per transaction and accumulate bitcoins over the next year or two in hopes that bitcoins/usd will be much higher in the future.

huh?  you go into walmart/cvs/gas station etc and buy the greendot/moneypak refillable cards with cash at the register.  this costs $5 to buy the card.  you go into IRC and give a trusted member (you can check WOT or just ask for recommended users) the scratch off code from the card you just purchased.  they put it onto their own visa card and they send you btc instantly.
paypal and moneypak/greendot have nothing to do with each other realy.  you are just able to use moneypak to submit funds onto paypal (i think ive never done that) and i could see this being free from the chance of a chargeback since someone has purchased the card already.

why not?  not *everyone* has malicious intent....
to the OP, the problem is nobody knows.  what type of trading strategy do you wish to use?  do you want to day/mid term(months)/long term(years) trade?
my 2c:
day traders should probably wait to see if it goes below 4.64, if it does price could hit $2 range.  if it goes above $7.2 then we could easily hit the double digits quickly.  as you can see this window is massive so everyone is a bit confused right now.
midterm trader: no idea, wait it out and see until you are comfortable to gamble.
long term trader: buy any time

thank you!  yea i went into bitcoin-otc asking about the 17yo thing.  i dont buy it.  its obviously an attempt to stay anonymous and my theory is the age of 17 is just another layer of security by being "underage." i am not too worried about it being a giant scam as im sure they are making some good money and it will only continue as more people start to learn about bitcoin. 
with that said,i am mainly interested in attempting to understand how it all works to see if i could potentially make any type of wise investment and get some returns.  so far none of this makes any real sense so i am staying far, far away for the time being.  
so far all i really know is that somehow this lets you invest some money and they give you "credit" to spend in order to make more money (leverage?) there are also different levels of leverage with different associated risks (how risky is 1:1 ?)  people can then setup specific buy/sell orders short/long term.  what i want to do is buy where i feel it is low and go long term (1-2 months) as i predict the price will eventually hit $8+ soon.

That's false, if a hacker has access to the actual app files it's trivial to replicate the same app on another device
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:41:52
It depends on the type of 2FA you are using, with GAuth yes he needs access but that's relatively trivial.  
Worse is with SMS based 2FA as its even easier to MiTM
2FA on your smartphone and even SMS based 2FA is infinity better than none at all - but if attack is a concern then a dedicated hardware based 2FA is the best option
When it comes to security anything on your daily internet connected cell phone is the worst idea ever.

i guess it comes down to this...would you say that there is price difference between buying from mtgox or mining + electric cost.  Assuming hardware was free.
I am interested in investing as much as comfortable and play around with it as if it were the stock market.  
Finally, do you know of any "bitcoin" market analysis people on the nets?  I feel like this whole system should be easy to predict if you have the knowledge.  Or am I way off here?
@_date: 2011-11-30 18:29:14
lets say you had 2 5770's for free, if you added up electricity cost of about $0.12 kwh could you potentially make money?  how would one go about calculating these things?  I have seen that you can even calculate to a certain degree how many BTC you can mine with a given card.

Source 1: 13.56 TWh/yr = $677 M/yr  
Source 2: 6.78 TWh/yr = $339 M/yr  
Median = 10.17 TWh/yr = $508 M/yr

10.17 TWh/yr .... I don't know about you but that number has no meaning to me.

"according to IEA statistics, the world's consumption of energy for year 2013 was 108,171 TWh/year."    
1)  
2)   
In the grand scheme of things - only 0.0012% of the world's consumption of energy goes to Bitcoin mining. Hopefully in the near future mankind can ultimately work together to find a true renewable form of energy. But even still we must also consider the insane amount of innovation and genuine disruptive technological advances Bitcoin gave to mankind (altcoins included).  
The statement that Bitcoin mining is wasteful implies an unwillingness to respect the value other than its price per BTC.   
Your assumption that bitcoin will use an exorbitant amount of electricity does not include the fact that in the future so will everything else.  Which is why we need to find a real answer for renewable energy at a global scale.   
If bitcoins consensus algorithm ever becomes uneconomical, then it could always change its algorithm.  Hyperledger and specifically Intel's[ PoETS algorithm]( i think has great promise, especially now that Linux and AMD have active projects to use Intel's SGX tech in to their chips.
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:59:38
Apply the same logic to literally everything else.  Don't you think in the future as population size increases and more 3rd world countries advance they will use more electricity?  
You are failing to realize that in the future the average person will be using more energy regardless of bitcoins future.  
This is why true renewable energy is a must and bitcoins energy usage is a moot point

Yes do a Google search on BitFinex it's all over the news 
TLDR no usd wires in or out, partially/likely a large reason for the price increase.  BitFinex has been the leading exch by volume for years so the market follows it.  Now that ppl cant pull fiat out they have to buy BTC to get it out, thus artificially increasing the price.  The spread has lowered the last few days but still, don't use BFX until it's all sorted.

This is what we created [CoinFunder]( for
Basicly you pledge an amount of bitcoins - once a certain amount has been pledged an email is sent to the company explaining what bitcoin is, how much has been pledged, and we help them implement coinbase/bitpay if they wish.  If they accept an email is sent out to all pledgers to send their coins.  We also try to negotiate some type of discount/voucher for anyone who pledged, if not the coins sent are just a "bribe" for a promise to accept bitcoin.

Yes I am still interested.  I think the new announcement about BFL chips is a huge gamechanger, especially if we can pull together a bunch of users that have the discount codes.  I just purchased 16 discount vouchers.  Minimum order must be 100 chips must be made.
1 Chip = 4GH  ($75)
100 Chips = 400GH
Price with no discount: $7500 (Potentially much lower with a bunch of vouchers)

A doctor, a lawyer,and an engineer are sentenced to death. Why is not important to the story...what's important is that the death sentence will be carried out in France - via guillotine.
The doctor is first. The executioner straps him down, hoists the glittering blade aloft, and lets it drop...whereupon it sticks about halfway down.
Now, it's a well-known tradition in capital punishment that if the execution apparatus fails for any reason, this is interpreted as a sign from God, and the death sentence is commuted. Accordingly, the doctor walks away, still very much alive.
The lawyer is next. The executioner straps him down, hoists the glittering blade aloft, and lets it drop...whereupon it sticks in the exact same spot.
Same rules apply...lawyer walks.
The engineer is last. The executioner straps him down, as he hoists the blade aloft, the engineer twists his neck around, peers up at the blade, and says: "You know, I think I see your trouble there..."

He got charged for hacking a German bank (some hackers say he never did this).  
AFAIK he never did any pump and dump - a long time ago he announced publicly online that he was going to buy a bunch of shares of an equivalent eBay EU website which caused stock prices to dramatically fluctuate yet he never followed through.
He got into NZ of a waived "good character" requirement.


EDIT: i reread his entire wiki and he is a badass who sticks it to the man every chance he gets.  there is no reason to not trust or support mega.

You have a few options which are not too hard once you set everything up. You can go with bitinstant which is extremely easy. Or you can verify your mtgox account and setup dwolla. Dwolla to gox takes about 3 days but only costs $0.25.
I too share your frustration about the lack of easily and instantly using a debit card to get bitcoins.  Hopefully this will be possible in the near future.  The recent reddit thread about setting up a btc bank in Panama sounds really interesting.

I'm assuming that extra 6% you are adding is the fees for buying on gox? You don't have to buy goxusd you can buy bitcoin directly. I purchased about $78 worth of goxusd for about 83 and change last week. I'll pay a 5-6$ fee for bitcoin in a matter of minutes. That CC site looked like it had a $12 fee. With that said.. Some might find being able to get btc without leaving home worth the price. If you are lucky enough you can become friends with people of the community who you gain trust with and are willing to send you coins or gox codes via bank deposit for little to no fees. I was once subscribed to 2 of the more popular analysis services and met a lot of really cool people - you can find non gougers in  as well.

There really needs to be an easier way for North American users to get funds into BitStamp.

I would be down to do this.  I would also be down to manage it.  I have generally cheap electricity $0.13kw/h and have a basement with exhaust fans already set up as well as a 50amp breaker connected to a 12 port conduit.
Id be willing to prove identity to an elected moderator.
I also have 64 avalon chips expected to come in mid Aug, perhaps we'd like to order more as a group?
EDIT: After thinking about this for a while I really would like to get this going.  I think we should form a dedicated subreddit and vote which company we would like.  After some maths an avalon group buy would not be cost effective unless we could find a cheaper option to put the chips together than what is being asked here: 
**Break down of a 504Gh/s Avalon build:** 








EDIT: am in preliminary talks with a respected member who may be able to drastically reduce assembly cost.   
if we can find someone to do the service for ~$5k it would be a great investment and likely be operational (~2-3 months) before BFL starts shipping these devices.

I'm not sure how coinbase.com implemented the 3minute instant verification system, or how costly it is but it is an extremely easy and secure way to make sure people are who they are. It basically pulls info from your credit history and asks you 5 or so questions such as past addresses, date of car purchases, family member names etc. I would definitely look into that if you guys want to be legitimate.

You have a point here.  Maybe an answer to this is to send the merchant a link/pdf to all people who pledge to buy their service/goods and the amount each person pledged.

1. Coinbase is pretty much what you are describing (assuming you are in the US) - Blockchain.info/wallet also in some way.
2. Not necessarily, people will know that X address has Y amount of bitcoins but it's not possible to single your wallet out AFAIK.
3.  Please do this right now :  
encrypt your wallet.dat with a very strong password you will remember  
back it up on a thumb drive, your email, google drive, drop box and any other place you can think of - as long as your encrypted wallet.dat file has a good password even posting a download link here would make it virtually impossible to steal its funds.

Dear Gox team - I know you guys have been taking a bunch of flack, you guys truly are the head of what is bitcoin in terms of a marketplace.  I don't think its fair for all the hate you guys have been getting when the problems are due to a very sophisticated coordinated attack.
My questions are:
* what are preliminary ideas to avoid this in the future?
* do you intend on setting up any kind of circuit kill switch like the stock market uses - [info](
* are you able to look at the history or orders and see what account(s) are perfect in timing large sell offs prior to the DDoSing and then near instant buys when trading resumes in order to get some type of an idea who is doing this?

[**Update: Endgame**](
With ASICMINER today announcing blades for as low as 3.5BTC, it appeared that Avalon chips that do not mine today are not going to break even any more. While those blades went already out of stock after some hours, the new price for mining rig is officially set. Essentially this means that if Avalon does not ship the remaining chips fully within the next two weeks, they become worth less than their shipping costs.
Driven by this event, today I was flooded with refund requests that built up a queue of ~2000 chips. I do not expect any takers for this and it is realistic to assume that there will be no further refunds.
I am sad to admit that I do not believe in a fast and complete delivery of the remaining batches. This stopped to be a game the moment this group-buy alone funneled $500k to Avalon. Although we have only a small set of 'no BS rules', we still have a written commitment to deliver in time as part of the ToS. With so many community members taking a loss directly or indirectly through Avalon failing to meet their schedule, we (together with other customers) need to consider taking serious actions to end this tragedy.
**At this stage our options are as follows:**  
















I personally will approach Avalon with options B and C for now and consider combining forces with other group-buy organizers for D if we do not hear back within a reasonable time-frame. If you have a different opinion you'd like to share, please do so either here or via PM.

No, you just want to make a quick buck.  You said so yourself.
EDIT: sorry, i'm probably coming off rude, been a long day.  My advice is this: go get a job as you have stated you are really only interested in fiat.  Invest 10% of your paycheck into bitcoin.  Hold on to the bitcoin until the price doubles and sell half.  Continue doing so every time the price doubles and continue investing with every paycheck.
Set up an account at [Coinbase]( (this is my referal link - you'll get 0.01 BTC for each 1 bitcoin you purchase free).  Register your bank info and setup the automatic buying option and calculate what 10% of your income is.

Bitcoin mining is turning into a full time job - not to mention a huge investment.  No longer can just anyone download a program and start mining with their video card.  Now people have to spend thousands of dollars on specialized miners called ASIC.
The video you watched is pretty old - but it does a good job at explaining bitcoin as a whole.  Bitcoin is ran by miners and it facilitates transactions.  If you want to make money, your best bet is to invest and hold (for years).  But only invest what you are willing to lose because none of this is guaranteed. 
We are all excited about bitcoin because it has a potential to be revolutionary - we also like the technology behind it.
Stop focusing on the mining aspect and look into the technical side.

True, but Avalon sells chips, which can be purchased in bulk and created into miners.
@_date: 2013-07-08 23:59:37


Before all of this merging talk I was a massive skeptic and fiercely thought it was a scam.  Now I think it is more along the lines of Ken just being really bad at PR and coming up with a business model.  The forum pretty much had to tell him how to set up this merger.
With that said I went from being 100% pessimist to 50%.

I sell them in person for about $20 the added cost is for shipping. For all the supplies (us products only) costs me about $14/bottle to make. in my experience US based ejuices average around this price. There is a VERY noticeable difference between US juices and China juices. And not to toot my own horn... i consider mine the best.
PS the other seller on bitmit charges a few more per bottle than i do.  
I may consider cutting shipping to about $3.75.

naming and pronunciation is one thing but I also think there should be some type of sliding representation of price in marketplaces.  say an item in dollars is 5.99 there should be some type of standard sliding denomination that closely reflects this number.  
so $5.99 would be represented as 5.99XXXX
i hope that makes sense. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:39:11
You are looking at bitcoin wrong, makes me sick how some (no, a lot) of people are only interested in bitcoin in order to make money.  Look at the TECHNOLOGY and become passionate about it.  If you are not passionate about what bitcoin truly is, things are going to end in tears when you buy some bitcoins and panic sell when price drops for a few months.
Listen - you wont make money mining unless you have $20k+ to GAMBLE on mining hardware which will become obsolete in less than 6 months.
Look at [charts]( - yes bitcoin has dramatically increased in price.  But from reading your comments you are into bitcoin for the wrong reasons.

im in the same boat.  i have pretty strong passwords but i really would like to have completely random ones and just rely on some software to safely store them.  must be accessable from my phone.
ive installed keepass and the keefox extension but it never seemed to be able to auto input the passwords.
ive heard about lastpass but AFAIK to use it on a mobile it costs money.
EDIT: screw it im paying for the premium its only $12 a year.

I did.  I mentioned both bitpay and coinbase using the exact argument that they never really have to "deal with bitcoins".
Here was the response from one individual:

i see.  again i really don't see much demand for this.  private trackers are not hard to come by and you can usually max your connection out even on public trackers.

I have my qualms with MtGox just as much as the next bitcoiner - but according to Tux they were being massively DDOSed (and also dwolla) so this seems to have been an intentional ploy to bring prices down..  At least you were able to place and cancel orders - even with a 5 minute lag.

I think Ken just lacks how to handle these type of things.  I think he is starting to learn.  All that really matters is he gets these Avalon chips online, the eASIC deal goes through and hopefully he starts selling a boatload of chips.
I talked to him on IRC and he said that his business model on (changing) pricing the miners will reflect a 3 month ROI which I think is a great idea.

Good point about the capitalization missing in places - it's a bad habit of mine.
Lost throughout the thread someone asked how to get bitcoins (a win?!) I listed about 4 or 5.  I also mentioned bitpay a few times as an alternative to coinbase.
As for explaining that they could manage the bitcoin conversion themselves, I felt that in this type of environment that would only cause problems so I left it out.

exactly this minus the scam artist opinion.  bitinstant just has no practical use anymore.
the only way i can see bitinstant becoming useful is if they start putting in bitcoin "giftcards" in all the stores - but thats an entirely different beast.
they need to come up with an entirely new business plan to be relevant again - or in the very least match service charges of coinbase.
