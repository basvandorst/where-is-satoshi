how was it "stolen"?

No, it's really not.
If I don't pay my bills, mortgage, etc and someone comes to foreclose that doesn't make it stealing. 
It's the same idea.

Why can we *only* assume this?

When you set up a bank account business or personal you agree to play by their rules. 
You agree/choose to be subjected to any fines, rules, laws, etc  that that account is subject to.

It is pretty well acknowledged that Mt.Gox either didn't file the correct paperwork or lied on said paperwork and that is what led to the **seizure** of their Wells Fargo assets.
Stolen would imply there was no wrong doing on MT.Gox's part and it was not in line with the law what the government did.

I'm sorry, but "stole"?

Well first of all you're about the 15th person to "come up with" with this exact theory and all of you have the same fatal flaw.
Assumption after assumption after assumption...
