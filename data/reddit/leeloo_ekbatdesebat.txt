Pretty sure it's [Bother]( by Stone Sour.

Fantastic reply, thanks.
I do have a couple of quick questions though...
Won't SegWit and Shnorr make transactions cheaper, but only from 'new' addresses? What about the older addresses? Or was your point that the advent of these improvements will alleviate demand, and thereby reduce fees, bringing these addresses in range of spending?

Sounds a hell of a lot like [Bother]( don't ya think? (I answered the question above, but you wouldn't have been notified, so just thought I'd answer yours as well :).)

The balance is less than the current average transaction fee. Once upon a time, these were called 'dust.' But as fees rise, they become not insignificant quantities of funds.

Ahhh, you're too bloody good! Thanks for the link/s.
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:51:16
Seriously??? This is what worries me. I gave some friends and family each about $500 worth of Bitcoin for Xmas and am now worried a time may come where they cannot spend it!

Ah damn. I suppose a mass-wide, coordinated consolidation effort to create a few Consolidated Transactions plus a benevolent miner to accept the far-below-average-fee-paying Consolidated Transaction is out of the question? :P

I wonder how high the rate of 'churn' in the network will be, which in this case will be the rate at which channels are opened and closed. The rate of churn would influence how often the "pulse" would need to be sent through the network along the channels.
I think you're algorithm is fantastic, and if it's not too premature to say, looks like it might go a long way to solving this notorious "routing problem" that FUDsters continue to promote. 
Have you shared it with anyone else, or looked into formalising it as a protocol (however rudimentary) that could be implemented in some fashion?

When I say 'recover', I mean "person in control of keys spend their Bitcoin." I worded that poorly, sorry.

Really? How so? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:25:52
Interesting! Thanks for taking the time to answer. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:41:43
I second this.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:41:37
Well said.

Good point. WBW is fantastic. A post exploring both big-block/small-block points of view written in the vein of a WBW post would be priceless.

I'll answer as best I can, but if others want to provide more technical answers, please feel free.


Theoretically, yes. This will make more sense once you read the answer to (2).


Bitcoin is whatever the community of users and hodlers deem it to be. Any fork still has some origin in the original (pre-forked) chain, but since forks can have new rules, the users may not deem a forked 'Bitcoin' to be abiding by those principles that make Bitcoin what it is... turning it into an 'altcoin'. 
Think of it like this... imagine you could duplicate yourself at this exact moment in time. I assume you are (for the most part) a law-abiding citizen, who upholds and abides by the principles of a functioning society. That is, you don't steal, you don't kill, and you treat people with respect. Now imagine the duplicate you decides these rules don't apply to him. If he wants something, he takes it. If someone disses him on reddit, he hunts him down and kills him. Is he still you? He shares all your history and memories, right up until the point at which he came into existence. But which 'you' would your friends and family consider the 'true' you? 
This is the same with a Bitcoin fork. A hard fork results in two coins, instead of one. One coin follows the rules of the original chain... the other follows new rules (the reason for the fork). If the community deems those new rules to be better, then that will become the new Bitcoin. However, the features that make Bitcoin so great - immutability, disintermediation, decentralisation - are a product of its rules. You change the rules, you break the features. 


If it survives, yes, it will become a separate currency. One altBitcoin might be worth 0.001 of one Bitcoin, for example. Anyone who has coins on the pre-forked chain (the shared history between the two coins) will actually have 'two' lots of those coins upon forking. One of those coins will likely fade away into oblivion, and the other will continue strong. Such is the (dangerous) beauty of forks.
Hope that clears things up somewhat.
