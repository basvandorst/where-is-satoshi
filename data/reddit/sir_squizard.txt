Why do people upvote this?  It's crazy theories level.

You misread, he wrote "until the mempool is empty".

I just ordered the screen and the hdd for my raspberry thanks to your guide.  The only thing I wish I could do left is the screws and acrylic stuff, could you provide some links?  I have absolutely no knowledge with that kind of DIY stuff... 
Also it seems that the screen is a touch screen, maybe you could have used that feature :)

Thanks for your reply, I'm nearly all-done buying the materials.  The only thing left is the screws kit, could it be [this one]( that you used ?
Was really impressed by the delivery speed of the PiDrive (well, it was a bit expensive too).

Didn't some miners use FPGAs in the past? Just curious

Melenchon uses Frexit as a threat so the EU listens to him. Let's not jump to conclusions here. I wouldn't be surprised if Lepen also uses it for votes and won't actually do anything. 
You're overreacting to this IMO. As far as I know the UK isn't in bankruptcy.

That title somehow reminded me of Runescape.

Are you saying that you transfered debian from the SD card to a USB stick for better read/write performance? 
I was confused about that because I usually left the system on the card on my other rpi. I understand that the blockchain has to be on the pidrive, though.

Small question, why did you use an USB drive ?  Couldn't you just stay on the SD card provided with the HDD ?

I followed your guide a week ago and here is the result!
  
I wish I had a better chart than this one but I can't find any that fits the screen. I've been thinking about switching it to tor but I don't see why yet. 
I got into a bit of trouble when setting up the screen but finally succeeded after some changes in raspi-config.

I'm getting tired of these posts, I get it that Segwit is a good thing but no need to upvote titles without even a reflexion on the subject.

Can confirm, it's running UASF right now  (even though it took me a few weeks to download the blockchain).  I'm considering using cryptowatch as a graph, it looks neat :) 
I heard rumors about Western Digital possibly ending their production of pidrive, let's hope they're unfounded.

What a dumb post. This sub is about bitcoin, why should we give a shit about those irrelevant haters?
