I'd be slightly embarrassed if I went into detail about just how far I went looking for those files.
Suffice to say... Nothing.
I'm pretty certain that they were on a hard drive that I've long since destroyed after it failed (again, as a high schooler I figured "hard drive failure? Let me take a hammer to it and see how much it can withstand!")

I thought the concept was super cool, and the idea of my computer printing enough money to buy a burger and video game over a few months really appealed to a teenage me lol
I mined a bunch in 2010-2011 but eventually lost interest and it seemed too hard to convert my $50 or so in Bitcoin to USD so I stopped and eventually forgot about it.
Oh how I regret not keeping track of where I put those wallet files ��

I just made a quick transaction to test this and it went through, so maybe despite what you believe, it's a problem with your payment method? I was having issues with cards I know worked earlier in the week, and was only able to purchase with my bank for a small period.
Beyond that, it's also a good idea to be signed up and verified on multiple exchanges for this reason alone. Coinbase is my preferred, with Kraken as my backup.

I'm going to sleep right now, but my ENTIRE day tomorrow is going to be dedicated to absolutely nothing but sifting through old hdds for my wallet.dat. I don't even know what to expect if I find it, but in the short time I'd mined, I was using a custom-built gaming computer and would mine all day on weekdays [and used it for gaming on the weekends]. I did it more out of curiosity &amp; interest than any ideas about financial gain, and stopped when I'd lost interest.
I really don't think I'll ever find the file, it may have been on a dead or reformatted hard drive...but the realization hit me just a few hours ago and now idk how I feel

I tried to open an account on Kraken over a week ago, and STILL haven't even been Tier 1 verified [despite doing everything up to Tier 3].
In the end, it was a blessing in disguise, and I ended up just using Coinbase to buy some Bitcoin which I transferred to Poloniex to make the exchange I wanted before depositing into personal wallet.
After I managed to get that all done, I was still kinda bummed about Kraken...until the horror stories started pouring in.
I'm really sorry about what's happening with your funds. At the end of the day, personally, I believe it will be resolved....eventually. Things are crazy right now with the MASSIVE influx of new people and the tremendous number of exchanges occurring now, I really don't think any of the major sites were prepared for this.
As it stands though, waiting is most likely your best option, as there are no doubt hundreds in the same position attempting to reach them.

If you're going to ask others, you gotta share your own story :p
But with me personally, I was really interested in cryptography and steganography, and one thing led to another until I eventually stumbled upon Bitcoin. This was late 2009/early 2010. I saw genuine potential in the IDEA, but I saw Bitcoin as more of a proof of concept at the time than anything. Late 2010, I become a bit more of a believer and started mining and wanted to invest, but got cold feet and pulled out at the last second [I kept mining for a few months, though, into a wallet I no longer have access to :| ]
I followed Bitcoin over the years, buying small and making TINY profits just for the hell of it, and happened to hop on the rocket just before reaching the moon a couple of months back.
Some of my biggest regrets in life are how I handled my Bitcoins early on -_-

I've done in total probably around $1000-$1200 on my credit card in total I believe. I switched banks and my funds were still transferring over, so I made the purchase on the card. I paid off the Coinbase balance after a few days, however, but I don't think that really affects the matter at hand.

I believe that it's impossible to know for sure the exact number, but it can be VERY roughly estimated by counting the number of Bitcoin Wallets in use.
Now this isn't really an accurate portrayal, as many people have multiple wallets, and once a wallet is opened, it remains open, even if the person sells all their Bitcoins and never once looks back, or say got into Bitcoin back in 2010 and never really did anything with it.
Currently, there are just under 14,000,000 Bitcoin wallets
[Anyone more knowledgeable, please correct me if I'm wrong]

I've been using Chase for my Coinbase purchases for weeks now, and I've made a transaction with them over a year ago, and I've had no issues whatsoever
I've used two different Chase Credit Cards, but I don't bank with them so idk if that changes things.

Tactics I use to TRY and make small profits during times like this are to set a limit on the total amount of money I'm willing to gamble with, and under absolutely no circumstances break that limit. That sets the absolute threshold for potential loss.
It's also good to understand a bit about market trends, as well as be familiar with the particular stock/coin you're investing in. It's no good to pick a random one and hop in. Ripple is what I've been playing with currently, as it's been fluctuating between the .20's and .30's all week, and is currently at .16.
You also must keep in mind conversion fees/transaction costs, as those can very easily eat into whatever potential profit you'll make if you're not careful.
Those are the three main things that come to mind - setting a limit, understanding what it is you're investing in as well as general market trends, and making sure that you have the self-control to not panic sell or buy at a high price.
I'm by no means an expert, for the record, and the profits I've made by day trading like this aren't huge [a few hundred dollars this week through Ripple and Ethereum specifically].
Also, it WILL be stressful depending on your financial situation.
DON'T try to absolutely maximize your profit on every trade, as it'll lead you to put more pressure on yourself and face more disappointment. Be happy with small gains, and understand that it's incredibly risk and there's always a chance that you'll lose everything you put in by the time you come out of it.
With that in mind, good luck! :)
