I think you should join the university board, they need some straight thinkers like you showing them how to handle things.
@_date: 2018-09-21 06:30:17
The university was charged.

Perhaps it is an attempt to grow the rate of adoption.

An ETF basically works like a stock. It's price is directly correlated to the assets it represents. The ETF thus holds the underlying assets it represents, and sells holders participation in the fund through a stock-like instrument, that can be bought or sold freely in the market. It's price fluctuates throughout the day just like that of a stock. In this case a bitcoin ETF would hold a certain amount of bitcoin. For every person buying in, the ETF will have to hold a certain amount of bitcoin. It can choose to sell 1 share at $100, thus holding 1 BTC for every 10 shares it issues for example.

@_date: 2018-10-30 12:55:01
The price is merely one factor of Bitcoin, Traditional Financial Markets Faltering is another.
@_date: 2018-10-24 12:26:52

This is an excerpt from the article, opening paragraph: "the Chinese government is tightening its anti-laundering and license inspections on exchanges. This coupled with some other economic indicators from China, brought demand for cryptocurrency down"

1. The point of the article is to present a more nuanced approach to assertions that the price of bitcoin was largely buoyed by demonetization in countries like India. 
2. Bitcoin is a great tool with a lot of attributes that give its users advantages especially in countries in which large swathes of the population lack access to banking services. Despite these attributes, it still has shortcomings. At a macro level, it is very unlikely to replace cash at the moment. It doesn't matter how broken the monetary system is, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies still lack the scalability necessary to become credible cash substitutes.
3. If you are in India or Venezuela, you better have cash with you. Bitcoin will not buy you groceries or any other basic products you might need on a daily basis. US Dollars or Euros will, even if the government has decided to demonetize the local currency.
So that is basically what the article is all about. The Bloomberg report just strengthens the point. Bitcoin is still too abstract to most people, and it doesn't have the degree of acceptance that cash does regardless of how poorly monetary systems might perform. Maybe in a few decades with some hard work, we can change that.

Based on  price ticker.

Hey Holographiks, please calm down.
The title 'clickbait' is merely playing on the common 'here is why Bitcoin prices dropped' article theme- websites saying this is why and how it happened.
In our article, we have listed reasons it may have happened- informing the community rather than just 'telling' them.
We were hoping you could appreciate our satire humor but we understand the misunderstanding. We ask that you check out our content to confirm that we do not post clickbait blog-spam. 
Have a good day, Holographiks.

On 22 May 2010, the first real-world Bitcoin transaction occurred by someone buying two pizzas in Jacksonville, Florida for 10,000 BTC. Back in 2010 10,000 BTC could buy two pizzas, today 2 BTC can buy 10,000 pizzas so in other words, lots of value. Lesson is: Buy Bitcoin now and in 7 years, you can get a lot more pizza.
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:15:28
Glad we could relieve your stress levels. ;)

The location in the above is actually Birds Of Eden, still very cool how far a small South African town has come to accepting Ethereum even. Lets pump up those numbers, the more accepted\- the merrier for more.
@_date: 2016-10-23 07:14:57
maybe...
