I think any of the javascript generation methods offline would be fine, you can click the button a thousand times and write down an address when you are confident that it's not phoning home. 
sure you could also disconnect or disable your network adapter too, but you could write your own javascript generator if you had any doubts whatsoever. 
bitaddress.org is an example, just download the page, run it offline, print the keys off, save to a flash drive, write them down on paper, whatever you like

Two key factors in fair elections are anonymity and ensuring that nobody can vote more than once.
How do we use blockchain to simultaneously protect people's identities AND restrict people to only one address?
edit: after a few minutes I think I realized that your written ballots are meant to account for limiting votes to one per person, but what's the strategy for processing that data? are humans doing it? if so, it's going to take them forever to do just one. If computers are doing it, then we run into the same old problems of regular electronic voting.

watch carefully when it gets down to $220 - if it keeps falling, just stay away until it gets down to $200 and watch carefully again. If it bounces at either price, you should buy in a little bit at a time, but beware the "dead cat bounce".

I agree, it's absolutely brutal when you are just getting started; but they are pretty good after you've used them for a bit.
why are they such a pain in the ass? for their own security mainly, and for your security secondly. I like Coinbase, but I hated them during my first month.

I have 4 BTC and have zero interest in spending them ever. I literally put a paper wallet in my safe with a note about Bitcoin for my kid when I die  ... I'm pretty sure that's bad news for Bitcoin - just the fact that this is how much I think of it.

I haven't used purse.io ... I just don't understand how they can just give you any discount you want, seems like there's a scam in there somewhere.
Well, your video exposed part of the scam, epic fees :)
I don't think your analysis of the 'bump' on the graph is as useful as you might think, the actual discount line on your graph is what you want to look at - just always ask for the maximum discount, that's your lowest price, end of story. The blip is interesting, but not useful.

what he's really trying to do is get people to click his coinbase referral link. He put the image as his post link and said to check the comments for his referral link since he can't link to both from the post title.
He's honest about it, he drew a nice picture, no complaints here just wish I thought to do it myself :)
Of course, I doubt he'll get much because he's preaching to the choir (how many users on this subreddit don't already have a wallet and a preferred exchange?).
@_date: 2015-08-22 21:44:06
well, I'm just expressing general pessimism. I live in the US. There is literally nothing in my daily life that is bitcoin related. The only time I hear anything about bitcoin is when I check this subreddit (or the other one that's similar but I don't think I'm allowed to mention for reasons I don't fully understand praise thermos).
I think the logic and nature of bitcoin in general are just absolutely brilliant. I do have this fantasy where bitcoin is actually a widely used currency. But people in this sub kind of have their heads up each other's asses if they think bitcoin is "catching on" or any such nonsense as that. It's catching on like the Internet was catching on in the 80s. Only a few geeks and nerds used the Internet. And if you think that somehow proves that Bitcoin will catch on like the web did - you've got yourself a logical fallacy that I'd have to look up to sound smarter but won't bother becuase you've all already judged me :)

@_date: 2015-08-03 00:49:25
I'm using it as my only bitcoin wallet. The experience is positive, no complaints other than mindless ones.. It's pretty needy on the personal information front (for your own good) and the limits on purchasing bitcoins were frustrating at first (not entirely sure why they have limits, just don't let me spend the money until it's actually cleared, idk).
But the website is great/responsive, easy to use, easy to buy/sell/spend, etc. Also seems like a reputable company from my own research a month ago when I got started.
The one thing you'll probably hear from people, and it's something I'm working on myself right now, is that YOU do not own the bitcoins in your coinbase account, Coinbase owns them and has control over them, so you should feel at least a little nervous about that - and if you believe the value of Bitcoin comes from private ownership and decentralization, you should be ideologically averse to allowing a 'bank' to 'secure' your money. I've not come to my own logical conclusion about this yet, but as my coinbase balance increases, I'm getting very close to moving some of my bitcoin to cold storage. I think it's a good place to make exchanges or to spend from, so only keep a working amount of money in there.
edit: bah, I forgot to mention the "vault" feature of coinbase where you actually can get "most" of your private keys and legitimately control your own money.
@_date: 2015-08-02 20:23:58
but why would I not want to just ask for the maximum discount, pay the maximum fee, and get the maximum actual discount (yes, it's lower than the 50% they say, but it's still the absolute lowest price)? 
I've not used purse.io yet, so I'm probably ignorant here as to why it would be bad to just slide that bar all the way to the right every time.

As somebody who unashamedly just wants to be a part of Bitcoin without getting my hands too dirty learning how the algorithm works; could somebody, for the love of god, give me a few bullet points about what all this drama means for the average bitcoin user?
* Will my bitcoin disappear?
* Will my bitcoin halve in value?
* Will my bitcoins become XT coins?
* Will my private keys change?
* Will my public keys change?
* Will fees change?
I'm so sick of all this blah blah blah about forking and blocks ... I'm too stupid to understand what that means for me, an end user. Thanks.

I have a cold storage wallet - I just have my private key - I don't have a clue - do I need to do anything? Based on other comments it sounds like I'll be fine.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:43:23
well that's easy to fix, just buy everything you'll ever need in your whole life and then sell it to yourself in bitcoin prices as you need it. Also don't live very long because the milk is going to get chewy.

thanks! bitaddress.org is helping me make sense of what's actually required to restore a wallet. The "seed" seems like a proprietary layer that I don't necessarily want or need.
Follow up question though, in Electrum when I created a wallet about a dozen public/private combos were created - whereas bitaddress.org just generates one public/private pair. It makes a lot more sense to me that I should just generate keys as I want/need them. Does it make sense to just write down my keys somewhere and skip this electrum "seed" stuff? 
What I've just done is create a wallet on bitaddress.org and simply paste the private key into electrum and that automatically made the public key show up in electrum ... indicating to me that all I really need is my private key. No software, nothing, just private key and everything is tied to that. I could write my private key down, shove it in a safety deposit box, and 20 years from now if bitcoin is worth anything I can whip out my private key and plug it into whatever software or hardware exists. Am I right?
The only reason I think I'm wrong is because people buy hardware things to put in safety deposit boxes. Why? What does the hardware do that a slip of paper can't do?

near the end he was cracking up laughing ... I assume because of all the rude and obnoxious noise being made by people rearranging the room during the fucking event.
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:47:36
Crazy hypothetical situation, though.
Say I have my seed in a safety deposit box 20 years from now and "Electrum" is for some reason or another ancient history. All I have is my Electrum seed. Can I restore my wallet without Electrum software? How?

sweet mother of shit
and so many people just lost/deleted their keys because it was worth pennies and they lacked the foresight to become fucking billionaires. 
It's hard to live with myself knowing that just a few years ago I sold ~5 btc thinking it was just a fad. I cannot imagine losing 700 btc.

Perhaps it's an experiment that we'll see written about shortly. Not that we don't already know, but maybe somebody is demonstrating how no matter how many transactions you make to try to distance yourself from one individual transaction, tracking it back to the original transaction is trivial.
Any significance to the relative spacing of transactions in this visualization? (i.e., the fact that the connected chain is encircling other, seemingly unrelated transactions)

this was my first thought when I saw them. All **common** storage technology that I'm aware of has a limited shelf life (by common I mean magnetic, optical, flash)

Make this easy for us idiots: what do I do with my bitcoin balance? Do I need a new wallet?

Thank you for that video, I feel quite enlightened.

I barely know anything about BTC and I already have 1.
This shit is exciting. I'm only on coinbase, but I know I have to do some reading and learning about managing my own wallet and writing things down on actual pieces of paper and maintaining encrypted physical backups of multiple copies of my wallets on twelve different planets at all times... I just find it all so overwhelming that i'm a bit paralyzed, hopefully coinbase is safe??

these one hundred dollar bills are stupid and useless because if I set them on fire then I can't spend them afterwards. Somebody needs to make one hundred dollar bills easier to not light on fire.
I know I'm not very funny, but my point is that with new stuff we always like to think we are so clever in pointing out what's wrong with it while completely ignoring the fact that the things that we take for granted as being pretty good have just as many problems, we've just learned how to avoid them and we've learned how to call people idiots when they don't avoid those problems very well.

the most annoying thing is that they make it to /all so often based on so little. For this reason, I've concluded that they are a meme arm of the film industry tasked with 'organic social media marketing'.
