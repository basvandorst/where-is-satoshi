You can't stop Bitcoin.

Hey fuck face since you are so dumb and don’t know how this shit works here... It's actually pretty simple. Usually when someone wants to short sell bitcoin they take on a substantial risk. But with a futures market they can buy futures as protection and short sell physical bitcoin. If they have deep pockets and access to a large pool of bitcoin to borrow they can sell, and sell, and sell. Each time they buy the same amount of bitcoin futures as protection against the shorting blowing up in their face. If it does and they get squeezed the increase in futures price offsets their loss in the shorts. They need lots of fiat to cover like this, perhaps on different trading platforms but the net effect is low risk suppression of price.
The way to fight this is to take your bitcoin off exchanges and put it in your own wallet where it cannot be loaned out and sold against you. That's one reason many will tell you to keep the keys to your bitcoin, along with the risk of them being hacked of course, or frozen, as we often hear about. Don't let them sell your own bitcoin against you.

Yes UK folks know too well... that being said if he is getting into it and moving out of traditional fiat currencies. Bitcoin he can't crash per say as a centralized issued currency hence the problem IMO of a decentralized currency that knows no borders. The Genie is out of the bottle and Georgie boy is playing catch up using his influence and $ to gain leverage. Using MSM to FUD the market. Using pawns like Jamie at JPM and other stooges to act as Scarecrows to keep the masses out and buy cheap. BTC is a game of accumulation. I know it, they know it and you should know it.

You are that obtuse and dumb. You buy and then short and bet against it - you are the stupid people I’m talking about who don’t get how it really works. Ever since futures came out that were not settled in BTC but usd it is and has been easy to short futures make money and buy BTC cheap. Fuck You moron do I have to teach you how this shit works.

All this talk of a crash from people on the Google machine but ya think these people at Bakkt or Fidelity or TD Ameritradelr IBM or Nasdaq are going to great lengths to set up this new digital financial payments rail, systems, and spend all this time and money to see it go to zero... man ya all got another thing coming.  
The new system is being set up so when the old system crashes and most of the sheep, serfs, and plebes  take the hit the smart money has an exit.
When you see the Rockefeller family via Venrock buying BTC when you see George Soros buying.  Yeah you tell me there are going to crash this.... 
More like they already have been driving prices down for the past year. When Bakkt settles future they will be in BTC not USD that means they have to have BTC on hand to settle each day....
So if you have to have it on hand prior to launch wouldn’t you want to get as much as you can as cheap as you can prior to launch then long the shit out of it....
