Being a decentralised currency is its basic function. The blockchain does that better than any other technology. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:51:08


From the beginning there has been alternatives. Just a matter of how people balance risk, reward and convenience. Not to mention half a dozen exchanges (including Coinbase) condemed MtG when it failed, plus BCT-e. So plenty of clearnet options.

Many crypto already have near instant free transactions. Bitcoin is catching up, not the other way around. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:11:16
Distributed ledgers have been around for a while. Basically a public key allows read only and a private key allows changes to be made. The private keys have been controlled by a central authority though. The breakthrough of bitcoin's blockchain is that it provides equal opportunity. Anyone with the knowledge and an internet (also not centralised) connection can use it. 
The blockchain alone is revolutionary but it was build as a core component of Bitcoin. A currency isn't only the most common application, it's the most liberating.  
If there is one central authority you rely on for money and it can send men with guns to your house to put you in chain and throw you in a cage; it is wage slavery. If the powers that be can dictate what you can and can't buy or consume with your own money, despite doing no harm to others; you do not have sovereignty over your own body. If you can not support an organisation that promotes the disclosure of documents pertaining to corruption and war crimes; you are under the thumb of a authoritarian regime.
That's what bitcoin is to me anyways. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:27:41
People *do* use crypto as a currency for the sole reason that they're decentralised.
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:47:12
Mt Gox had funds seized by the government, was sued for millions, had been hacked and people still used it...

It's popularity right now is a direct result of it being used as a decentralised currency. That's no longer bitcoin primary use because there are plenty of other options now.

I don't think people in North Korea or Zimbabwe or even China are bragging about their mad crypto gains on the socials. For them anonimity and decentralisation is the difference between life and death.  
It's also a fail safe against overreaching regulations or outright bans in the future. Governments aren't going to give up the influence they do have by forcing it underground.

Gold exists independently of humans. Forget belief, as long as the laws of physics have a basis in reality, gold has an intrinsic value.  
The price of bitcoin is determined when two or more parties agree it's worth something. If every human disappeared, bitcoin the currency would cease to exist. Just like philosophy, religion, politics, legal systems, moral codes... They're all collective fictions that only exist in our minds
Aliens could later find the tech and retrieve the ledger. They fully understand how and why we used it, but they themselves wouldn't *believe* in it. Even if one person was left to proselytize  the virtue of Bitcoin- it would be like convincing a cashier to accept sea shells as payment. The social contract governing the value of sea shells fell out of favour millennia ago. People lost faith. 
Gold on the other hand is literally universal. Like us the aliens will know that gold has 79 protons, the size and weight of its atom can be measured, certain spectrums of light are reflected by it...  
After scanning Earth they will see that relative to other terrestrial metals; it's highly efficient at transferring heat and electricity as well as having superior corrosion resistance. It's extremely malleable, ductile, biocompatable and displays unique properties at the nanoscale.  
All of these things are facts that any concious lifeform can verify. No faith needed.

Not necessarily. Central banks are creating money out of thin air and loaning it to other banks with interest. Meaning there will always be more debt than there is money in circulation. Hence the rat race. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:29:26


Nope, exploding stars do that. It has an atomic number of 79, any lifeforms in the universe can verify that is its value. If they are so inclined.

Mostly talking out my arse but I believe it's just a matter of getting the best encryption for the lowest cost. Say all your seed words are less than  five letters, words longer than that can be discarded. Then maybe log the first letter and discard all words that start with any other and so on.  As long as we have perameters to work with, we can quickly reduce the possibilities.  
Having a larger list wouldn't really improve security anyway since there are enough words to make brute forcing improbable. From memory it only needs the first few letter of each word, the rest is just for our benefit. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:40:36
The central bank is controlled by the government so both are correct. Organisations like the IMF have more control over the supply of wealth than individual governments. Basically a bank for banks. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 02:59:43


Central banks also *create* the currency they lend. That requires a trusted authority to prop up its value but it doesn't have to be a bank. A crowd fund or DAO could create and loan currency in the same way. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:11:53
Measurement = Value; Magnitude; Quantity
The rest is only needed to give bitcoin value since it is comprised of nothing more than 1s and 0s.

Seems comprehension isn't your strong suit. I'll try to go slow.  
Think about all the greedy tards who fall for the countless crypto scams out there. What do they do? Go to social media to bitch and moan because they know the coins are gone forever.
There's a bunch of mysterious concepts like *regulations, consumer protection* and *insurance*. I don't want you to get all confused again but rest assured, financial institutions know all about them. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:56:00
Visa has days or even weeks to clear funds so scaling will never be an issue. Who will parse venders to insure funds are where they should be?  
Banks are paid to keep customers money safe. Some people simply don't want that responsibility. Until crypto comes up with a way to autonomize some sort of central authority that protects against bad actors it'll never replace the current system. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:38:05
No idea why you're preaching the merits of crypto at me. Save your energy for the masses that don't know or care what a ledger is. Or just patiently wait until people smarter than us develop superior tech.  
I simply pointed out the fact that visa will never have scaling issues and delayed transactions allow more checks and balances.

If anyone else feels this way please don't, or at least push it deep down inside where the ouchey thoughts live. One of the reasons scammers are so prevalent is because many people are too ashamed to take action. Kudos to anyone that does.

Fiat isn't a bad idea it can just be abused by bad people. Like most things.  
If the state creates imaginary money for civil construction projects they're adding that value to the economy. The states wealth has increased by the value of the project.  
On the other hand if you simply convince people that your imaginary money is worth something, no real world wealth is being created.
Despite the expert opinion of many cryptokiddies; trial and error over thousands of years has built the current monetary system.  
Fiat doesn't fuck people, people controling fiat fucks people.

They probably had a deadline to come up with the cash. Also as soon as people start noticing the funds moving they might panic sell themselves driving down the price. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:39:50
They have actually covered all settlement costs with this recent liquidation. That's if they are ordered to pay victims at the price when Mt Gox went under. If Japan kicks it up to a civil reimberment case Gox will be expected to reimberse victims or pay the yen at the current price. Seems extremely unlikely they'll be able to do that.

Sorry that happened to you. Trial by popular opinion is a really shitty thing that happens far too often.
News and journalism are (read; were once) obligated to follow ethical standards such as the ["Canons of Journalism"]( At the very least they should be discredited if they don't, preferably have benifits or subsidies revoked by the tax payers.
Tabloids are treated differently. They are generally not claiming to report factual news so are held to a different standard. Some anthropologists actually think gossip was a vital part of our evolution. Regardless it's always been a common pastime. 
I agree people shouldn't presume guilt without a trial. Definitely shouldn't be voicing those presumptions publicly.  
I also completely agree that the US (or any single nation) playing world police is toxic to human development.  
It's just that the risks of stifling freedom of expression far outweigh the benefits. A robust justice system *should* garentee a fair trial and compensate innocent parties for any damages the judicial process did. 
That'd be ideal Anyways...

Sure, but it will generally retain naming rights if there's concensus, most importantly among miners.  
Etherium foundation broke their concencus rules after the DAO exploit. In that case the minority which followed the rules and supported immutability tagged Classic onto the name. The onus was on them because a general concensus was reached that rolling back the blockchain was the best compromise.

Neither gained consensus which is why we still have BTC and BCH. 


...Consensus decision-making is thus concerned with the process of deliberating and finalizing a decision, and the social, economic, legal, environmental and political effects of applying this process.
