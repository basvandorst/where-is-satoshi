Hasn't this guy given us a specific date for his projections every few months for the last 2 years?
Smart man, to be sure, but jeez... How many times can you be wrong and still expect people to think you're right?

While you're technically correct, I've struggled quite a bit to find a publicly available audit trail to prove that's enforced and the physical securities are really held by the futures contracts issuers (or that they have the means of production) for the bitcoin futures launched a year ago and haven't been able to find it.

In the case of a futures contract, profits and losses are recorded on a day to day basis when price is marked to market at end of day.  The problem is that when they build a cash-settled future like the CME bitcoin futures, they don't seem to be under obligation to demonstrate ANY possession of the underlying.  At close of day, the issuer and the contract holder exchange payments depending on where the closing price is versus the face value, but at expiry, whatever value the future should have is delivered in cash only.  I get your point that it's rational that they would have the actual bitcoin as a hedge, saying that no matter what happens, they have it and can deliver it to have some control over their exposure and losses, my problem is that there's no audit trail to demonstrate that this rational behavior is what they are actually doing.   
Also, regarding your second point, in practice you don't ever need to hold an underlying to hedge a derivative; you can create a derivative that's tied to anything as long as there's enough volume moving through the market so that the issuer can reasonably expect to be able to move the underlying in the small percentage of cases where a derivative is exercised and physically settled -- all that needs to happen is for the prospectus to convince the regulatory body that there is enough demand and volume to justify the issuance of the derivative.
