I'm an Argentine software developer working remotely for an American company and I get paid entirely in bitcoin.
Getting paid through an international bank wire would mean losing approximately 50% of the value of my salary, so Bitcoin is a great workaround.

I either sell on LocalBitcoins or directly to a broker, depending on the amounts. I do pay for most my services directly in bitcoin though, and also tend to use them instead of fiat whenever I get the chance.

Not any more accepting than Americans are, I'd say, and probably even less so as adoption of new technology is usually slower here.
I've seen other people use it as a means to move money into the country, but mostly in the tech sector.
As a store of value there was a spike of interest during the last bubble to $1000, after all Argentines are desperate to move their money into assets that can hold their value better than the peso, but interest has dwindled since.

They're either too dense to get that, or the most likely scenario, they don't care. So long as they can stay in power they'll go full populism while completely thrashing the economy.

"Dólar Blue" is what the black market dollar exchange rate is called in Argentina.
