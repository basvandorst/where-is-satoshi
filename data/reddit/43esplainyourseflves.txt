i donated too, feel duped now that i put the pieces together, posted this and pmd it, only real proof that site is owned by said person:




If he shows timestamp then its 100% proof but if not then 100% scam, wait and see.

Then why did you hide your domain information? Nothing you have shown proves you are who you say you are, having a bitpay account doesnt prove shit, you can setup a bitpay account for some fake ass business then use it for something else.
Show a timestamp with your site name written on a piece of paper next to your face as proof that this is legit and that you are who you say you are, otherwise i will be lodging a complaint with bitpay and paypal.
