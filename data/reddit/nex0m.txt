Do more research or your 2000 will be a small amount. Regardless of what you think, you aren't late and still have time. I'm bullish on bitcoin, but you need to know more about what you are wanting to buy.

Ask for 5% over fiat conversion of $USD. I think BTC will go nuts, but that is fair or less market right now. 
FYI, if you are spending $USD or fiat vs BTC right now it will probably be painful later.

The context of the conversation is gold, but this gives a great overview of the last 30-40 years of how we got to where we are. If you have read Saifedean Ammous, The Bitcoin Standard, it fits into the narrative with more detail.

As long as it's Bcash, I'm fine with it. Print more useless for everyone.

How do I send you my private keys? All kidding aside, that is awesome after the tilt.

Security, that's 99.99% of bitcoin as currency or store of value, etc. If it's not secure, bells and whistles are useless. Good news, is that is still  focus or considered for most development. No it's not perfect yet, but the most proven at this point.
