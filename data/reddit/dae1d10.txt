I completely agree, my dude. 
 
Golden were the days where trolling meant making someone do something dumb and funny through wits amd smarts, now it goes like that, someone pretends to be retarded, another person calls them out, "troller" says haha! I'm not retarded at all!
 
Still dude, all they're looking for is a reaction. So don't give them one :)
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:32:58
Keep telling yourself that
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:09:50
You're giving him what he wants, so he'll keep making himself look retarded, and actually piss off some people
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:19:51
You're going to fuck yourself so hard
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:32:13
Y'all are gonna lose all of your money you idiots..
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:17:41
.... The dude's account is 2 days long. Can you guys please check the to see if the account is an obvious troll before feeding it?
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:19:18
sure ya did
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:04:26
Right? I've been holding off on that one. What's next, you're going to spoil WW2?
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:08:55
And the afterlife, too. Also you'll be paying bitcoin taxes to Jesus
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:17:06
I don't have any currency, but I come into this sub for these kinds of shit, this is fucking hilarious
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:04:01
This is such a bait. Think about it guys, if this dude was really making money of this, he wouldn't tell this to us! He would say "BitCoin is crashing again! Guys sell while you can!".
 
But no. No no no no.
 
No no. No. What does say? He says "Guys, buy and don't look at the crashes". Now WHY would he say this?
 
You see, my dear redditors. It's because in fact, this dude KNOWS bitcoin is going to crash, so he's trying to make you all buy, incresing demand temporarely, giving him the perfect opportunitty to sell before the crash.
 
Hah. I got you, you trickster, you can't decieve me! 
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:36:09
Hahaha truth is, I actually want BC to crash, waiting for GPU prices to come back down so I can make a new build
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:34:40
Lmao, yea no, you're the one who's gonna delete this comment in shame. You fucking poor soul. Literally
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:32:26
No, just a great way to get fucked and lose money. By all means, keep doing that.
@_date: 2018-04-08 08:46:57
Oh yea, I'll totally remember that one guy (cuz you're totally the only one) on reddit that thinks crypto will rule the world. Forget the fact that you know nothing about economics, don't realize that bitcoin has pretty much the same problems that a gold based currency had (and we dropped that), and I'm totally gonna cry in 5 years because I didn't make/lose money on this random ass crpyto. Get real you moron..
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:20:36
Yes. I am a person, fellow human. Beep boop.
 
For real tho, no it's not fucking garanteed, since it's really about how many people trust in bitcoin. Trust goes down, usage goes down, price goes to shit. It's not even close to being mathematically garanteed lmao
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:16:18
Yeaaaa, no.
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:54:41
My dude, if I'm wasting my money I'd rather go gamble, at least that way I'll have fun. People looking at bitcoin thinking that they actually are gonna make money are making a wrong move.
 
Those who say it's certain... It's mathematically almost certain... I have no words /shrug
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:27:45
I don't make predictions, because it's all fucking random and unpredictable. People who legit think they can predict what's it gonna be like are delusional. 
 
The best thing you can do is buy after a big dip and sell after a small rise, that's the only way to consistently make money off of this shit
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:02:03
Oh yea, it's GUARANTEED to be worth more, right? People are fucking dumb
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:04:03
So do we use reddit comments as tips now?
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:03:53
If you think banks are lesa stable than bitcoin, you're fucking delusional to the point of ridiculousness
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:44:31
Idiots who saw fight club and thought "Yea! Banks going down would definitely solve all the worlds problems!". Like people haven't learned from the Great Depression of the 30's and the banking crash of 07
