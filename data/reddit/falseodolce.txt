Did you just ask Reddit if it was a good idea AFTER convincing your father it was a good idea?
I am guessing you're the one wearing silk slippers descending the stairs.

If you find a $100 bill on the street and put it into a stock that is worth $100.01 after 10 years, do you celebrate because you made an 'infinity' return? No because that's not being honest about the real return and your real performance.
Should you be any more careless or more careful with this $100?
Whether you ultimately pay back your dad or not is not important right now. What is important is that you get yourself in the right frame of mind and thinking like a real investor, not a punter.
Doesn't matter the source, you should always be accountable to yourself and take responsibility for understanding your investment decisions.

The price of BTC only changes against the fiat currency it is quoted against. As an example, lets say that the exchange rate as at 11:42AM is:
USD| GBP | JPY | BTC
1300 | 1000 | 150K | 1.0
For simplicity of illustration, lets assume no transaction costs and spreads are immaterial. This means that at 11:42AM you can freely exchange one currency for the prevailing value of another currency. Your USD 1300 can be quickly converted to GBP 1000, the GBP 1000 can be quickly converted to BTC 1 etc.
Suppose at 11:43AM there is some unexpected but extremely negative economic news coming from Japan. As a result, traders currently holding JPY currency will want to offload what they have and start offering to sell JPY 180K in return for USD 1300. Other traders see that and decide to get out of JPY before it drops further so they price it at JPY 190K, then JPY 200K, then JPY 210K. Now the exchange rate as at 11:43AM is:
USD| GBP | JPY | BTC
1300 | 1000 | 210K | 1.0
You will notice that none of the other currencies have shifted because the GBP holder could have still converted their GBP 1000 for USD 1300, and then used that USD 1300 to buy the JPY 210K.
In this example, you can see that the value of BTC has only changed against the JPY.

It's disappointing that none of the hacks ever result in transparent reporting of the ***cause*** of the hacks. 
What are the attack vectors and what could prevent this from occurring again? Lessons need to be learnt from these hacks but its seems like there is no knowledge sharing between the exchanges and their customers, nor between the exchanges themselves.

The answer is your first word.

Genuinely curious.
I've heard many recommendations for cryptosteel but one thing I cannot get comfortable with is how obvious it makes the content. There is no getting around the fact that the contents of a cryptosteel are seed words. You could jumble the order of them, but this can be solved with little enough effort.
Wouldn't it be safer to record the seed words in some other fireproof medium that doesn't advertise that it is for a cryptocurrency? e.g. cheap stainless bracelet, engraving on the inside, stored in a safe.

You can take a principled stance and mine if you want, but it doesn't change the fact that it is no longer an economically viable venture.
It is worth pointing this out so people are at least aware of what they're getting themselves into.
