Here's what I got from the news on TV:
The Korean government is going to pass a law (no dates yet) that will close all crypto exchanges operating in Korea.  Trading between individuals is still ok (owning Bitcoin still ok) but there are concerns about potential black markets.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:01:14
I live in Korea and I'm watching the news right now.  The government is closing the exchanges.

Adding a passphrase would give you peace of mind.
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:59:01
Does anyone else think he comes across as really likeable?  Very reasonable, nothing sensational and generally seems like a nice person.
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:48:34
Is Bitcoin really popular amongst white nationalist groups?!  12:21
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:37:46
Haha ok, yeah I thought so!
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:14:28
Good on him!
Is it normal in America to call your parents by their first name?
@_date: 2018-09-13 05:49:48
Thanks so much for the detailed reply!
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:57:43
Yeah I noticed that too.  Absolutely ridiculous statement to make.
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:57:34
Then the bystanders all clapped.
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:37:50
Let me guess, I bet he looked him dead in the eye and without missing a beat, he said that.
Obviously didn't happen.  I don't know what planet some people are on.
@_date: 2018-09-13 02:37:06
What's your take on the future of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-05 04:19:25
I feel like this is one aspect of Bitcoin that's a hard sell to sceptics.
Buy an expensive/fancy/cool-looking/highly recommended hardware wallet but at the end of the day it's down to you not to lose a bunch of words written down on a piece of paper.
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:21:22
Sadly I think you're probably right.
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:25:32
Haha yes my wording was a bit messed up.  Thanks for the link!

They're slang terms that refer to a game where someone holds coins in their fist and shakes them.  If the other person guesses the correct amount of coins they get to keep them.
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:58:16
Haha cool!  Where in Korea is this?
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:54:21
Can someone explain what this actually means in laymans terms..."Buy 167,222 @ 6754".
What happens during a liquidated short?
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:53:39
Maybe a stupid question but I've never been able to find the answer:  Are you able to lock the cryptosteel?
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:51:02
Same.  I've been really strict with myself; no buying until the ETF decision.
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:06:59
I wish they'd hurry up and sort out their issue with Paycash.
Deposits via SWIFT or SEPA still suspended for GBP (have been for over a month)!!
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:31:04
Completely agree with this and I'm surprised more people don't say it.
People act like buying a coffee or a beer with Bitcoin is simpler than paying with cash or card.  It really isn't.
I might be wrong but I get the impression that most average Joes like me only care about the price of Bitcoin and seeing it rise and rise and rise.  I don't want to stick it to the man or burn the governement to the ground.  Who cares.  Just let me see a good return on my investment.  
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:52:17
I didn't even realise they offered this!
Absolutely LOVE Korbit though.  Transferring money in happens instantly.  
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:58:08
That is has trapped me into not putting any effort into my career. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:42:10
The more I read about the fork the more confused I am!
From reading the Trezor blogs, it sounds like after the fork your amount of coins doubles?  Is that right?!!
So if I held 10 coins before the fork, I would have 20 coins after the fork (10 BTC and 10 BTU).  Surely not?  
Then replay attacks means spending coins on the BTC chain also spends them on the BTU chain.  But isn't that what should happen?  If not, then can't I just sell all my BTC coins and then all my BTU coins (potentially making more money than I could have done before the fork, depending on the market values of both coins).
I can't get my head around it :' (
@_date: 2019-11-30 08:38:52
Good work!
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:48:52
Presumably then, if you decide to sell, you can just choose to sell them as whichever coin has the highest listed price?  Is that right?
Assuming the private keys are your own (paper wallet, Trezor etc).
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:46:19
Which month was that?  I can't remember it being sub $1000 in 2017.
@_date: 2019-03-07 02:46:04
The beauty of Trezor is that you can add a "passphrase" which means if anybody gets hold of your seed words you're still completely safe!
Even if they could access the Trezor and enter the PIN, they'd still need your passphrase to access the wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-10 02:04:40
I really wish they had put a clearly visable Bitcoin logo on its body. 
Unless you're up on the "what Warren Buffet said about Bitcoin" news, you're not going to know what this is.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:31:40
Yes, also agree with this!  Thanks for the response.
I guess it just rubs me the wrong way when people arrogantly dismiss genuine interest or curiousity in Bitcoin with a smug "Jeez, have you even read the white paper". 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:17:54
Yes I completely agree and think that's very reasonable!
@_date: 2018-06-22 04:21:00
Thank you : )
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:06:55
I still don't understand what this is about.  Can anyone explain the time travel aspect of the story? 
@_date: 2018-06-21 04:42:28
I've read all the Twitter threads at least twice, plus SequaciousBower's comment and I still have no idea what's going on.
@_date: 2019-02-21 23:32:40
Very cool!
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:59:21
Old people are old but they're not stupid.  As long as you don't talk to him like he's a child I think he'll be fine!
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:35:37
Can someone explain why mining difficulty affects the price so much?  Has it always been this way because I can't remember anyone ever talking about it before (only in the past couple of months really).
@_date: 2019-02-07 00:21:28
It needs to get much much simpler.
The average person doesn't even know how to torrent something.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:09:35
As someone who sold all his BCH a while ago, I'm feeling pretty sick right now :' (
@_date: 2019-12-26 00:14:51
Hi Stephan, I really love listening to your podcasts; thanks for making so much good content!  Slowly making my way through the back catalogue, perfect for at my desk with a cup of coffee.
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:03:30
I've been binge listening to these recently and have found them to be very interesting, covering a wide range of topics.  He's had Plan B on three times!
@_date: 2017-04-24 01:50:48
I'd be interested to know how they're blocking you.
As far as I know the word "Bitcoin" never appears in a transaction (unless you include it in your reference ID for the transfer which is a bad idea and most exchanges specifically instruct you not to do this) so how does the bank know what you're doing?
I'd say use Bittylicious.  It's very quick and easy but be prepared to pay over the market price.
@_date: 2017-04-04 22:51:02
Yea bittylicious is definitely the easiest if you live in the UK.
Just a quick bank transfer and you get your bitcoins in a few minutes usually.
@_date: 2019-04-26 23:48:42
Hahahahaha :D
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:44:02
The arrogance of that presenter was really unfair I think.  Did he have to be such a smug prick about it?
@_date: 2018-11-19 02:44:00
This is a great thing to keep in mind during these shaky times.
@_date: 2018-11-03 00:02:15
Beautiful!  Hope I can buy some of your future work!
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:07:15
So all of the Bitcoin he's been selling to pay everyone off...where did it come from?  Mt Gox still has that much Bitcoin??
@_date: 2018-11-16 01:19:19
Haha this is gold.
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:35:43
"...that held the codes to his bitcoins..."
Hahahahaha :D
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:48:44
Are you living in Korea?
As far as I'm aware, Gopax is the only exchange that will allow foreigners to deposit and withdraw Korean Won (₩).
I used to use Korbit but since the rules changed I can no longer put fiat in or get it out there.  
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:49:28
I'm surprised nobody posted it when we hit $4k again haha.
@_date: 2018-11-04 12:42:30
Ok, will do!
@_date: 2018-11-08 22:39:54
Missing details:
He stopped, looked me dead in the eye and without missing a beat said "but they can't confiscate your bitcoin".
Everyone clapped.
@_date: 2018-07-10 09:18:16
Ooh not sure.  
I also thought that maybe those videos were copyrighted or something like that and his account was flagged.  Very strange!
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:02:40
Isn't this kind of thing a really strong argument for Bitcoin ETFs and custodial solutions?
None of this stress/worry/paranoia.
@_date: 2019-09-05 04:32:28
"Bags you actually want to hodl".
Genius haha!!

A glimmer of hope in a hopeless life of working a job you hate for no money to please people you don't like.

Every morning is Christmas day and you don't know if you're getting a lump of coal or a PlayStation!
@_date: 2018-07-19 03:51:19
Cool thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2018-07-10 08:55:17
Yeah I spotted this earlier too because I usually check his Twitter most days.
I noticed recently he has been posting short clips from the World Cup which I thought was very odd.  Could he have been hacked?
@_date: 2019-09-05 04:28:01
Yes he's definitely the best for general crypto news.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:25:46
I would love to do it but for me it feels too risky with all the transactions and institutions that are involved.
I'd expect the activity to be flagged pretty much immediately by my bank, if not the exchanges I use.  Then your coins or fiat could be stuck in limbo while they investigate and you're in danger of losing any potential profits and even risking having your accounts closed.   
@_date: 2017-07-07 01:24:15
"If anyone puts me up for an award or anything like that..."
@_date: 2019-05-06 09:56:04
Are you sure about that?
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:25:42
Yes this is correct.
If you want to do it you have to send fiat from one country to another at some point.  I'm certain that banks would flag this up if people were doing it over and over.
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:10:36
This is amazing!!
@_date: 2018-12-03 00:53:21
Took me a while before I realised this isn't actually Conan O'Brien hahahaha.
@_date: 2019-05-21 04:15:36
Yeah I do that too.  Definitely the safest option.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:36:11
Just imagine if someone with his kind of reach openly endorsed/discussed Bitcoin.  
Come to think of it, has there ever been any public figure (I mean Beyoncé level of fame) who has ever talked about Bitcoin?  I always wonder how people actually get into it outside of an introduction from a friend or a fleeting mention on the news.
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:53:36
I really enjoyed this podcast but I agree with you.
Often the host would, for some reason, try to summarise a point made by Andreas, only to get it completely wrong.  Andreas then has to explain again, or simplify it more for the benefit of the host. 
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:31:37
Thank you for the explanation.  Even though I'd heard of "60 minutes" I didn't realise it was divided into segments like that.  Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:04:53
I feel really sorry for the whole situation but why has the Bitcoin been sold?  That's a terrible deal for you and your ex (who could have been a multi millionaire in the future with that amount of BTC).
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:49:22
I can't believe there might actually be a chain split.  It's unthinkable.  The ground Bitcoin would lose is unfathomable.
I'd like to buy Bitcoin please.
Sure, legacy or BIP148?
Which do you want?
I just want to buy Bitcoin.  I saw it on the news last week.
Ah the chain recently split so now there are two.
Which one is best?
Maybe you should browse Reddit first.
What's Reddit?
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:24:13
His arguments against Bitcoin are reasonable I think.  His farm analogy makes it really clear why he doesn't like Bitcoin.
All you have to do is think about "when BTC reaches X price, I'll be a millionaire" .  Well yeah but to realise your millionaire status you would have to sell all of your BTC and be left with nothing (except the cash).  You can buy a farm, continually sell its produce but still be left with the farm at the end of the day.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:22:15
Greed is a really powerful feeling.  I'd bet that when the price starts going back up (even if it happens slowly) people who had planned on selling might hold their horses for a bit.
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:32:27
Thank you, I didn't know they have multiple segments per show.  Thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:43:54
This really is beautiful art.  A little bit out of my price range though : (
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:35:05
I can never get my head around why people spend their coins.  Why buy a Steam game using Bitcoin when you could easily just use fiat?  I genuinely don't understand why people do this.
Isn't it the same situation as the common "I had XXX bitcoins but lost my harddrive!!  I'm kicking myself!!"  You had bitcoins and now you don't.  But spending them is even worse because it's voluntary!
My outlook is simple; I won't get rid of an appreciating asset.
@_date: 2017-06-19 05:39:25
I really wish people would clarify what they mean when using the terms "fork" and "split".
I don't think a fork necessarily means a chain split, does it?
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:37:14
13 minutes?  I'm not American so does this mean the show actually filled an hour long slot?
@_date: 2019-05-10 01:43:12
When they realise they can't ban it the only other option they have is to buy it lol.
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:49:26
Completely agree.  Exciting times definitely.
