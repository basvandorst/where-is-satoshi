Yep I agree with all that. To sum up for OP, yes there are people who TRULY understand how bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:12:43
but actually yes, just happened.

You can believe in bitcoin without irrationally investing all of your money into a highly volatile market. I'm not saying the payoff wouldn't be great, but the risk right now probably outweighs the payoff. 
I just can't understand why someone wouldn't do a 3-month trial period with half their salary in bitcoin rather than all of it forever into the future. There are still a lot of issues to overcome and those aren't going to be solved any faster by people going 100% bitcoin overnight.

yes, there are plenty of people who understand exactly how bitcoin works, from mining to 51% attacks to UTXOs, its actually not that complicated. The important part is: bitcoin is a commodity and its value is determined by how much people are willing to pay for it. It takes around 4 hours (at most) to understand conceptually how bitcoin works.

GDAX and Coinbase are the same company (GDAX is the exchange operated by Coinbase). In both groups, they control the private keys not you, so there is no difference in safety of your bitcoin. Additionally, because they are actually owned by the same group, if one goes under (in a Mt. Gox scenario), then they both go under. 
In order to "trade" bitcoin you generally have to have it on an exchange. That means its in their account and not in your private account (ledger nano s or a trezor). Sending bitcoin generally takes a few minutes to an hour, so if you plan ~~of~~ on buying/selling during slight changes in the market, you need to keep your bitcoin on the exchange.
Most people recommend only keeping an amount on the exchange that you would be willing to lose entirely (in case something happens with the exchange). Then you use that ~~so~~ to buy/sell on the market. If you're actually cashing out or buying in (for long-term moves) it's generally better to [dollar-cost-average]( your position and so you won't be too concerned with the hour-long trends of the market anyway, just the day-week-month trends. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:19:30
but is it worth the risk when bitcoin regularly swings +10% in &lt;24 hours?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:11:15
Sell $2,000 worth and then keep the rest. Pay them back their investment and keep the rest. (To me at least) it seems kinda selfish to ask you to sell it all just because they're concerned about the volatility.

But the concept of how transactions work, how the block chain works and how to buy and sell goods, services, or bitcoin is extremely straightforward. You don’t need to know who created something in order to understand it. 
Even the cryptology aspect of bitcoin is easy to understand. I am making it sound easier than it truly is, but to say that most users don’t understand bitcoin is putting the technology on a pedestal that will only prevent further adoption, 
Edit: you don’t need to understand each step of a SHA256 to know that you can take a string of letters and numbers and irreversibly scramble it.

that was a pretty intense read for someone who is new to bitcoin. Here's a *highly* summarized version of difficulty:
When a miner is trying to mine a bitcoin block what they are actually doing is taking a bunch of inputs (all the transactions that they want to include in the block and all the meta data about the block) and they are **hashing** it. Hashing is a type of operation on input data that effectively scrambles the output data.
For a bitcoin block to be valid, the hash of the block must be smaller than some value, which we can think of as the **difficulty** for that block. The interesting idea about hashing is that even slightly changing any part of the input creates radically different outputs. Therefore, you can't know what input you need in order to create a certain output. Remember, that we want the output of our hash to be lower than the difficulty.
One part of the input data for bitcoin is a random parameter that the miners get to choose. The goal of the miner is to find a certain value for that parameter (all with all the other input data) such that the resulting hash is less than the difficulty level. This value is known as a **nonce**.
Another interesting aspect of the hash functions is that you can predict (probabilistically) how many random values of the nonce you are required to try before you will get a hash that is below a certain value. Therefore, if you know how fast you can do these calculations (hashes per second), then you can determine *how long* it will take to find a nonce who's hash is below the difficulty (remember this is the same thing as mining a block).
As mining power increases (more and more people trying to mine with faster and faster hardware), you would think that it would take less and less time to find a block (since we can show mathematically that with a certain hash rate it takes a certain amount of time to find a nonce who's hash is below the difficulty value). 
To account for the change in mining power on the network, as measured by time it takes to mine a block (which is the same as time it takes to find a nonce who's hash is below the difficulty), the **difficulty value** itself gets lowered (meaning it is **more difficult** to successfully mine a block). Therefore, even though the mining power has increased, the average time required to find a block will stay the same in the long run. The difficulty is updated by the network every 2016 blocks in order to make sure that the time required to mine a block stays relatively constant.

yes it is still worth investing. The odds that you will become a millionaire off any single investment is just ridiculously small and to be honest, not very rational. Investing in bitcoin is the same as any other type of investing. Do your research, figure out what returns should be expected (hint: nobody can predict the future), and only invest what you can afford to lose.
For reference, I was in your position three months ago and hadn't bought any bitcoin. I bought in at ~$3500 thinking it was "too late". My investment has now more than tripled. Since then I have bought two more times (at $7000 and again at $9100 during the dip after breaking 11k).
This isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. Those don't exist and anyone telling you otherwise is either a fool or trying to scam you.

you should [watch this video]( that actually gets into the explanation of how bitcoin addresses are created. 
To clarify, watch from the start of the link to 7:20. The bitcoin address for any wallet is the public key for that private/public key pair. Its also a little more complicated than that actually, in that there are checksums to make sure the address is valid, so its actually not possible to take a random address and successfully send bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:14:25
($13,000)/($2,000)*($50)=$325. But actually, he was right. You should really be able to figure that out on your own.

Assuming you're in the US, then if your bitcoin position was short term (your total time holding bitcoin prior to selling was less than one year), then you owe tax on it at your individual tax rate for this year (2017 tax year).
If it was a long-term position (you held your bitcoin for  more than 1 year prior to selling), then your tax on it is stepped. For a single filer (its doubled for married filers), if your taxable income (excluding the sale of bitcoin) is less than $37,950, you owe no tax on the sale of your bitcoin. If your taxable income (not including the sale of your bitcoin) is between $37,950 and $418,400, then you owe 15% of the value of your bitcoin sale in tax on that bitcoin sale (and normal amounts for your other income). If your taxable income is greater than $418,400, then you owe 20% of your bitcoin sale in tax on that bitcoin sale.
In reality, you likely held some of your bitcoin for more than a year and some for less than a year. You will have to calculate exactly how much each of your purchases netted you in value and whether they were short or long term in order to determine tax on them. Also, if you converted to cash on an exchange but didn't transfer to a bank, you *may* not owe tax on it because it wasn't a realized gain?
So for example, lets say you bought $100 6 months ago @ $2,000/bitcoin and you sold it for $10,000, then you sold it for $500 and therefore netted $400. You will owe your normal yearly tax on that $400. If you additionally bought in 2013 for $1,000 per bitcoin and sold at $10,000, then your $100 will have netted you $900. You only owe tax on that $900 if your taxable income is more than $38k, and then you only owe 15% of that $900.

that is something I hadn't considered. I wish I were in that financial position.

It is possible that someone is using a wallet with the same public/private key combination as the one you create for yourself.
There are 2^256 different address combinations, so the odds of this actually happening are extremely small. To put this in perspective, there are 1.15 * 10^77 different combinations of keys. The universe is only 10^17 seconds old.
That means there are a Quadrillion Quadrillion Quadrillion Quadrillion public/private key combinations for every second the universe has existed. Its is essentially impossible that someone else has the same keys that you do.

very exciting indeed, just not something I would recommend to the faint of heart. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:01:31
This is super risky, but there’s nothing incorrect about what you’ve said as far as I can tell. Whether bitcoin will be up after 45 days may as well be flipping a coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:41:31
I'm not opposed to investing heavily in bitcoin, but I just don't think this scenario is good for everyone. Each individual needs to consider their own financial situation and their own risk tolerance. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:22
Its based on the middle-market price of that exchange. People on coinbase are willing to buy at 18.89999k, and willing to sell at 18.90001k. While on coindesk, they're willing to buy at 16.49999k and sell at 16.50001k.
The two exchanges just have different people buying and selling. GDAX/Coinbase is basically crashing right now because everyone is panic buying/selling to try and get their position.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:38:27
You'll have to look up what the rules are for doing that with stocks since the US treats cryptos basically as commodities. If your normal stock brokerage counts that type of transaction as a realized gain then you will have to pay tax. If you have a stock brokerage account, then they probably have that information on their website.
You could also contact the exchange and ask them directly. They should know what the rules are.

you should google around and do some research about bitcoin addresses and keys, but the basic idea is that any matching private/public key is a valid address to which bitcoin can be sent (or sit forever).
In order to receive bitcoin you only need to provide someone with a valid public key. In order to send bitcoin out of an account/address you must have both the private and public keys (the public key is derived from the private key, so if you have the private key you automatically have the public key).
Coinbase, GDAX, Kraken, and all other major exchanges operate by hosting "your bitcoin". You send bitcoin (or fiat currency) to their address and they create an internal account that says you have "x" amount of bitcoin or fiat currency. In reality there is a bitcoin address that Coinbase owns. In this sense they are "like" a bank where they are the ones who have access to the money (bitcoin or fiat) and they've partitioned it out internally into different accounts for different people. 
If you actually want to "own" your bitcoin, you must be the only one with the private key, because if anyone else has the private key they can send your bitcoin away from that address. Therefore, Coinbase, GDAX, etc. are viewed as generally unsafe locations to store bitcoin because you don't own the keys to those accounts. If something happens to the Coinbase account, your bitcoin could be gone/stolen (read up on Mt. Gox, this has happened in the past). 
A "wallet" is just a program or piece of software the stores private/public keys all together and gives you some tools to access. If you have a way of generating a valid private/public key pair, you can send bitcoin to that public address and never have software deal with it at all (sometimes called a paper wallet).
General consensus on the sub seems to be that if you're serious about crypto, you should get a hardware wallet (ledger nano s, trezor, etc.) because they're as secure as a paper wallet, have methods of recovering if the device gets wiped/destroyed/stolen.
Never share your private key(s) with anyone ever. Don't put them in a place that can be found or hacked. But at the same time, try and keep more than one copy so that if one gets destroyed, you can still remember it. Most people can't remember 32 random bytes of info, so you'll inevitably have to "write it down" somewhere.

"Don't invest more than you can afford to lose"? If you can afford to lose it and be fine, then you're fine. If not, you'll be stressed until you sell it.

While that is one option for the use-case of bitcoin, most people today aren't doing that. People trade currencies in order to make money. Most people ~~are~~ aren't going to trade USD to GBP unless they're going to the UK for a while or they're trying to make money.
With bitcoin as volatile as it currently is, most people will feel bad about buying something and then having that amount of bitcoin be worth significantly more in some undetermined amount of time later. It doesn't help that the hype on this sub convinces newbies that their bitcoin will be worth huge amounts more in short weeks/months. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:54:53
I was able to buy at $9145 on coinbase. I missed the last drop after the $5,000 crash, I'm glad I got this one.
EDIT: [proof](

You seem to be making the assumption that bitcoin will become the dominant currency (or an equally dominant currency). In that scenario, yes, the scarcity of the coin will make its value rise. However, if everyone in the world just decides: "fuck it, I don't give a shit about bitcoin, I'll stick with GBP or USD" then the value of bitcoin is nil. 
Blockchain is different that value. Every bank in the world could switch to blockchain for every fiat currency and bitcoin could still be worthless. It sounds like you don't understand what a bubble is.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:09:48
Alright, we agree on all that. The problem I have with the original post is that it seems to state "if you think bitcoin is a bubble, then you don't understand the blockchain." That's simply not true.
