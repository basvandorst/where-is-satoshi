Not sure if this answers your question, but if it's in the form of an option (futures), then I don't see why not (buying a contract affecting BTC with BTC is OK). Otherwise to "short" you'd just sell BTC and buy back later at a (hopefully) lower price. You could also do margin trading, and use e.g. 1 BTC with 1:10 leverage, meaning, you would have 10 BTC to play with... I'm really (dangerously) oversimplifying it, but all of this you can research yourself, unless you have very specific questions... good luck!

If approved, price will increase in the short term as BTC will become a more valuable asset, given acceptance as an official exchange traded fund. Also, even more people buying to anticipate this (accelerating price increase). Expect spike.
Else, price will decrease in the short term as people follow herd-economics, they get scared and sell, because they perceive this as bad news, and also because everyone else is doing it. Expect dip, with a rise, the period in between being the risk factor of not HODL.
In the long term, BTC is going up regardless, and it really doesn't matter whether COIN will get approval or not.

Essentially. Also, you know that once you buy, e.g. -1btc for 1btc, with no leverage, pretty sure that, since the underlying is BTC (which will cause a profit if it goes down) doesn't affect the fact you purchased at the original price, which just happens to be the underlying in this case... But then again I might be getting mixed up with derivatives...

I have one too, I understand.

Nice, added.

All margin trading really is is borrowing money. But you knew that. Your confusion is with "pairs" (I used to FOREX haha), think about all the other things you can short --- the US dollar, stock, bits of paper that promise stuff... you are just buying (in whatever currency) a negative value of the instrument you're trying to short. You see now that if you shorted BTC with BTC, and at the same amount, you would net 0 (== selling all your BTC). Thus, the margin is necessary to allow for a profit on top of this. I hope I'm making some sort of sense...

HA! Thanks for making me actually smile.

Aaaand we just hit 1300...

I mean, yes, for loads of other use cases. Try and get a number setup in under 2 mins. Twilio, you can. Sendgrid? You tell me. Also tell me the price difference for using one number for a couple of days for both services. Etcetera.

Probably. *holds head in shame*

Always appreciate OS code, however...


Probably... only because announcement is tomorrow...


Should have used MailChimp or Twilio, and get users to enter their keys (cheap, easy, and guarantees an email/SMS). Gmail will reject most requests,  might help those who want to try... but even then... much hair will be pulled from much sockets. Pun intended in hindsight.
**Alternative** (only because it's fun):
    import vlc
    p = vlc.MediaPlayer("file:///path/to/really_loud_alarm.mp3")
    p.play()

Well obviously... oh, I didn't put that disclaimer... editing...

No idea what you're asking here...
