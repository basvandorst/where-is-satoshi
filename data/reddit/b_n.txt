Just curious, why would things get crazy? Media attention?

He uses British-English spelling which lends credence to him being from Australia, or at least not from the US.

The Sydney addresses linked in that forum for TF don't match the house that was just raided, if you were maybe expecting them to.

I was googling to see if anyone historically had questioned if Wright was Satoshi, and found Wright had answered this Quora question "Is Edward Snowden Satoshi Nakamoto?" from a year ago: 
Edit: He's also upvoted a number of Satoshi related answers, which is hilarious to me for some reason.

I guess Wired And Gizmodo received the docs and were on the same trail for weeks. Must've been devastating for the Gizmodo journalist when the Wired piece came out.

It's in Gordon. There's a media stake-out outside so there are pictures of the street on twitter.

Thanks. The reason it seemed important is that Leah used this quote by Arthur


as a central piece of evidence to her case, and I was wondering if this was taken out of context. If it was, she no doubt has taken Dorian's words out of context too.

Wasn't he replying to Leah's emails until she asked about Bitcoin? As well as commenting on Amazon and YouTube videos. This is getting too weird.

Or bitcom. Thanks Dorian.

Hi Arthur, both you and seem familiar with (and comfortable using) reddit. I'm curious about whether you knew of bitcoin before recent events? Were you at any point aware that your brother shared the same  name as the "creator"
Edit: I don't mean to be accusatory or invade your privacy further, I just wonder if clarifying this might help kill some of the attention you're family is getting.

Did he? Add me to the list of people who've misquoted him.

Why not both as Satoshi?
