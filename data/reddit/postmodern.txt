Exchanges have become defacto banks. As mining difficulty increased, exchanges became the primary entry point for new Bitcoin users. It's annoying to see all the negative patterns of Capitalism manifest themselves in Bitcoin (ex: scams, theft, middle men, market manipulation, government seizures, wealth concentration). Ideally, the Bitcoin protocol should have mechanisms to combat these.

Since bitcoin is p2p, they would have to subvert the services that users depend on for day-to-day convenience. For example, they could use trading bots to manipulate bitcoin's value. They could also push through laws regulating how businesses can use bitcoins; if the MPAA/RIAA can push through legislation so could Banking Institutions.
A more insidious end-game would be for the Banks to adopt bitcoin, create their own pool, create their own centralized client/protocol, require identities be associated with addresses and charge fees for everything. Much like how a majority of users stopped downloading music from p2p file sharing networks, once the iTunes store launched.
