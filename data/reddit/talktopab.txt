Thanks robertsieg. I live in Shanghai. I agree with what you say. I speak sort of ok Mandarin and open a bank account was kind of easy but as discussed here Shanghai is not the same as other cities. I have an account in BTC China but long time I do not use it (all RMB spent in BTC, no RMB right now). I had a Citibank account in Spain that has been cancelled for "suspicious transaction" (i.e. transfer money to bitstamp to buy BTC). I had Citibank because no charge on ATM withdrawn of RMB if in Citibank ATM. But now I can't anymore. I want to avoid passing through a ATM to convert Euro from my Spanish bank account to RMB in China and be charged x%. I have openned a INGdirect bank account but stop my Euro transfers to bitstamp or other BTC related BTC exchanges bank accounts. I have a couple of questions: 1 Do you know a international bank that would not ban transfers to BTC exchanges? (I know I can buy in local bitcoins) or perhaps, there are now BTC exchanges that work very close with fiat banks and to transfer to some of those should not be a problem, do you know any of those exchanges? 2 Can I liquidate my BTC in RMB into my bank account associated to my BTCchina account or this is not easy anymore? Thanks a lot!

I know people who has lost a lot of money in Neo&amp;Bee. The money seems lost forever but is there a way to make this idea work? With changes such as those proposed by Øystein Aaby, reducing dependancy on bitcoin price,... it can use what Neo&amp;Bee has built already. Would there be chances to do it? I would like to invest in such idea.
