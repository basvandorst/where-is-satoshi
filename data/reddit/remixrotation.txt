but if the EU decides to adopt Bitcoin: what are they gonna do with the Euro account balances -- erase them and set all that money to 0?
if ppl rush to buy your bitcoin with their Euros, and you do sell, what will you do with all these countless Euros that are not used anymore?
it is much more likely that the citizens who do have Euros and don't have Bitcoin, decide to "vote" for a new Euro++ with a conversion of 1:1; and then keep using E++ as that is what they have anyway.
what kind of a timeframe is involved?  
if fiat is predominant for another 100 years, then the entropy might work well enough, but if we "convert" in the next 25 &amp; there are still more fiat transactions taking place at the moment of conversion; then the conversion will be to a brand new crypto intended for that exact reason -- i mean, Europe did not transfer to the Lira or the Deutsche Mark: instead, they created a brand new thing, for that specific purpose.
of course, i could be totally wrong :))))

and it's not just a question of how long will it keep going up but also the question of competition. why isn't bitcoin worth 100k already today? because of all its competitors. 
but, the real competition is yet to show up to tango: sovereign cryptos financed &amp; backed by their respective govs.
edit: spelling

agree 100%: using today's cryptos would mean that those who were accidentally born earlier had an unfair economic advantage to hoard cryptos in existence right now.
