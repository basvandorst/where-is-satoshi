I've got almost an entire bitcoin stuck on a watch-only wallet and I've tried every thinkable way to recover it. It sucks diiiiiccckk.

The glorious peak of human thought.

Woah. I'm just saying that I nearly jumped on bitcoin far before a lot people heard about it. That's all.

I had the chance 5 years ago to pool some money together and get bitcoin for around $15-20. But back then I just didn't want to commit a couple hundred bucks. Oh god how I wish I'd have gone for it.

I think pure socialism and pure capitalism are both bad. Mixed economies would both allow natural growth while not pricing the poor out through government protections. That said, I sort of supported Venezuela's regime at first. But I can't anymore. Not with all the stories like this coming out of there. Best of luck to OP.

Nope. I have faith that bitcoin will become the new worldwide common currency eventually. So I'm just going to hold it until then.

Im still up 600% from when i bought in and I'm definitely not selling. Bitcoin is the future!

I bought in at $650. I'm hoping Starbucks starts accepting bitcoin.
