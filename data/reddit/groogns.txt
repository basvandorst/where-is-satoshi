You don't get to see the results unless you vote. The real lunatics are the majority of yes/no voters who really don't have a clue. Respect to people that can admit they aren't informed yet.

The value of a coin is determined by what the traders in the market have agreed to trade them for. The market cap is then calculated from that figure. You are right to say that the market cap has not factored in any coins that are permanently lost or coins that do not participate in the liquid markets though. 
When extra coins enter the market this will effect the tradeable value, due to simple supply and demand. Dont feel like I need to provide a source for this theory like the other poster requested however. :D

Honestly not experienced that before. If coinbase is giving you an est. delivery date then it must have been approved. Id chase up coinbase and like I said, call your bank to make sure the transaction has been given authorisation.

Even if 10k bitcoins were sold on gdax it'd drop the price to 4.5k usd.

DCA is for mitigating risk as well.

Banks are constantly blocking crypto transactions for 'fraud prevention', so call your bank to make sure.

That volume is made up of the same coins being bought and sold multiple times over that period. 10k new coins sold at once would certainly have serious long and short term effect.

Bitcoin is far too volatile to make such calculations

When the final block reward is given, it becomes a fee market. People will secure the network/update the ledger for the fees people pay to the network for transactions to be included in the next block.
