Did you seriously get this? You are literally gonna clean up all of our giveaways haha
Anyone reading this: I think starsoccer is the only entrant for our hashtag giveaways in our recent specials. Listen to them and tweet the hashtags so you can win Bitcoin, silver, and more. There's a hashtag in the audio-only version of this song too, on our website.

How about I fix that? ;) Thanks for sharing this!

Well, you're right. That's what I meant when I said the system was centralized, so really anyone could do anything or kill anyone. But technically, only certain people are supposed to be put on this specific list.

Again, I think I agree with you. One thing to remember though is that not just anyone could be assassinated. The idea is that only people who are responsible for the deaths of many other people and who are essentially above the law, like Obama, can be submitted for assassination. However, it is a centralized system so there's no guarantee that those restrictions will be obeyed.

There already is a Primecoin. Broke some records iirc.

Got a french press for 33% off :) good deal.

Very important distinction. However, if someone makes that argument, then probably no one on the list deserves to die because people like Obama do not personally commit the murders they are condemned for.
@_date: 2014-05-16 21:51:51
The argument is that it's not even murder. Supposedly it should save more lives than it takes by way of erasing governments which commit mass murders daily. Still not saying I really support it though.

I think I agree with all of that. The only thing might be if someone was clearly killing many other people, they might deserve to die. But that requires a justice system to determine who's doing what to who, and that system could be corrupt or make mistakes and kill people unjustly. On the show we basically said it MIGHT be okay, but there are almost always better alternatives and killing people like Obama really won't do much good.

I definitely agree that it could give Bitcoin a bad reputation, but I'd be interested to know why you think it's immoral.

Wasn't really ripping off his work. I never claimed it was mine (the copyright is still in the image) and I wasn't even the one to add the Bitcoin. I just saw it and thought it was a funny idea worth sharing.

If you wanna leave comments here, there's a good chance we'll find them and address them on air. :)

Just found yesterday's post: 
This is more or less a "nevermind" comment, but I'd still be interested to hear any thoughts if you have them.

Made a real quick and easy trade on Wall of Coins today. Great platform.

Right now it just shows our last live show. The page will be updated as I get set up for a new one.

Same for me, super fast.

I too was hacked. Lost 1.1 BTC. I'm in contact with Purse head honchos. We'll probably do a live show tonight.
