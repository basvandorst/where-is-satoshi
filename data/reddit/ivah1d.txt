Iranian here, the government's price for USD is 42000IRR (being used for important imports like Medicine..,etc) while on free market its 172000IRR and BTC is now legal to trade in iran with a price of 1,150,000,000 IRR so its the same price in every other place in the world in terms of USD

Less than 10% of my portfolio is Nano and it's really good technology, i own a little more LTC and BNB, the rest is BTC.
You guys are bad at assumptions, just like the way you jumped into conclusion on Jussie Smollet's and Covington Kids, Kavanagh and [Many many other ]( but you bamboozled into this way thinking that if someone doesn't have the same values as you or agree with you (just like your instance on Nano) there is something wrong with them. Like you always have this higher ground of morality.
Thanks for your concern though, but i guess you need more help than me.
PS: bought the nano in late 2018 in the rock bottom, averaged at 1.3~$. Thanks to coingate it had more real life utility than BTC for me, not saying that it better, you and i know it's no coin can compete with BTC's reputation. But it's good at what it is, which is being fast and feeless.

Pathetic clowns.
