I've read it. 
The financial and trading world experiences bubbles on a generational basis. Usually the participants are too young to have remembered the last major bubble (2000 dotcom anyone?). 
-  companies with zero profit history or path to profit being valued in the billions, because they were "dot com" 
- remember every 'normie' company adding ".com" to their name/business plan and quadrupling their value overnight, 
- remember everyone saying *"but this time it's different"*
   
- [Dogecoin Market Cap Hits $1 Billion, to Its Creator's Dismay.]( This is worse than *anything* we saw in the dotcom bubble.
- [drink company changes it's name to include 'blockchain, increases share price 200%](
- [Real currency is the bubble NOT Bitcoin, cryptocurrency professional warns](
