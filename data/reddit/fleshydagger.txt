That's only a reference to a principle. This was not applied in your case, since apparently you did not decline the request, but only challenged its validity. 
Is that true?

I read it several times and very carefully.
The NC found that:


There's an important difference between finding a certain administrative procedure to be legally unfounded, and declining to fulfill it. They had the right to ask the information, and you had the right to decline giving it out.

According to the NC's decision, you were asked to provide certain information. Instead of declining to provide it (citing self-incrimination), you challenged the right to ask that information. Your lawyer made a mistake here.

There's no "standard speed" because it has enough space to include all transactions in the next block. Even a full penny is overpaying it. The cheapest transactions included [in the latest block]( are $0,0073.
