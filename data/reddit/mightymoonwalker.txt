No, those weren't false flags, they certainly were not "proven" to be, and you are clearly an idiot of an almost hard to imagine magnitude. And trust me, I have no desire for you to debate with me, the rantings of an idiot are not something I want to spend a lot of time on. If you don't like providing evidence, people should give you the time and respect that is worth, which is zero, and we can all move on with our day. Us in the real world and you in your tinfoil hat factory.

It's not even in the top ten thousand.

There is no problem with that graph. That money is not in circulation. It's merely used to allow Interest on Reserve monetary policy, and it's a policy that has been an idea for decades and recommended by many Libertarian, free market economists. The actual money in circulation is stable. 
Here is the same chart with money in circulation separated out from Feb bank reserves.

And you have fun in your little bubble of self-delusion.

This is just a guy whose gotten sucked into a rabbit hole of nuttery. These websites that he reads claim every event that occurs is somehow a false flag operation by the US or our allies and never have any reasonable proof whatsoever, with the entire global media being complicit in pointless and insane crimes that would be ridiculously self-destructive. All while somehow praising the integrity of countries like Iran and Russia. It's just nonsense.
Russia has 20k troops and a full military deployment next to the Ukraine with multiple radar stations. If Ukrainian jets shot down the Malaysian airliner, Russia would absolutely know about it, which would make their silence a bit strange. The Donetsk rebels also tweeted about shooting down the plane then deleted it just minutes after doing it, and the BUK launcher is in multiple videos being moved to and from the scene.
Yes, the government is going to let people use social media, and no, it's not revolutionary to support a Free Palestine. Also, the US dollar is pretty damn healthy, and talk of its imminent demise is silly. In my experience, people talking about its demise usually rely on their own misunderstandings of the monetary system, which while ridiculous, isn't going to be replaced by some currency from Russia.

You mean they went to their inbox and searched for "bitcoin"?
@_date: 2014-08-01 13:56:15
There is logic to support that...let me try. If no one uses BTC, it has a value of zero. If people do use it, it will have a positive value. Ok then.

How the hell are you a "finance professor person" and you post that graph? You understand that's not money in circulation but bank reserves used to allow an IOR monetary policy, right? we haven;t seen an increase in prices because that's not spendable money.

You could fit every tiger on the planet in a high school gym. What's your point?

In both academia and in business, I have regularly spent a few k for a conference with great, honest organizations. A decent conference isn't cheap or easy, and bitcoin certainly should have them.

This is incredibly stupid.
@_date: 2014-08-12 23:15:41
Yes, the burden of proof is on you. Just like it would be on me if I said aliens did it. I do find your holier-than-thou attitude amusing though, especially when combined with your insistence on having no need to back up any of the wildly absurd claims you make. Have fun with that.

Most libertarian theories support competing currencies. maybe all of them. And the US had competing currencies for a long time until the state stopped it. This is just stupid.
@_date: 2014-08-01 13:53:51
Yeah, because the Earth is totally handling 7 billion people like a champ, right now. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 16:33:31
That's completely silly.

In fact, I'd be willing to bet that out of every single species that has gone extinct in our planet's history due to any reason whatsoever, every member of that species could fit on 10% of the Isle of Man, if not 1%. Species are a bit more then the 12 square inches they are standing on.
