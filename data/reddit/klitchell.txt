perhaps not to you or other people who are familiar with bitcoin. But to outsiders who already have a hesitant view of bitcoin an endorsement from someone who is at best eccentric and at worst one step from the nut house only deters progress IMO. 
Like it or not public opinion matters, and having someone that is at least perceived as crazy by the general public giving an endorsement doesn't really help.
@_date: 2016-04-09 13:31:00
just because the guy has a similar opinion that you do on something doesn't mean that he isn't crazy. Also McAfee hasn't always had good things to say about bitcoin so there's that too.
@_date: 2016-04-09 13:22:08
An endorsement from a crazy man is hardly an endorsement.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:36:12
Both, I have no problem doing that with my alts because they're really cheap and quick. But I'd rather not lose $60 in fees and I also don't want to wait 3-6 hours to get my coins. 
But that is definitely the way to go if you're nervous/concerned and are sending a large sum.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:46:32
1. Never said that we should take bitcoin away, so this overreaching narrative you're trying to make that correlates me to some nutcase that wants to get rid of something based on ineptitude doesn't work. 
2. As you can see by this thread I'm not the only one who thinks this.
3. PEOPLE FUCK THINGS UP, I guarantee that even the infallable has made an error on a simple task at some point in time.
  
I'm not making a case either way, this doesn't have to be adversarial but somehow you have made it out to be.
For the record I am invested in Bitcoin but it's failings need to be fixed and yes it needs to be much, much easier for the masses to adopt it or it will NEVER catch on mainstream as we want it to.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:18:37
yes, i know what I'm doing, but it's pretty easy to screw up a copy/paste operation. I haven't had a problem doing it, but I can definitely see that people would be apprehensive to do it when talking about sending sums of money.

They're the ones who would have a problem, but at some point if you change a large enough amount of coin into fiat they would definitely ask you where it came from, and if you weren't able to answer with evidence it could become a problem for you even if it wasn't nefarious.
If you're buying it legitimately you wouldn't have a problem most times, but don't be surprised when people do get asked.

it talks about the government knowing where your money comes from. Which to one side of the crypto world essentially means the end because if the government knows where the money comes from they'd be in trouble.
These are probably the same people who don't think we should pay taxes unless we want to.

The hero we don't deserve. The first I heard about Bitcoin was Andreas talking about it on Joe Rogan's podcast.

think of it from a perspective of long term, they've just demonstrated to you that they can completely manipulate their system and boost the price of an asset or decrease it at a moments notice, that's a pretty scary proposition if you're in it for the long haul.

Third time it's happened to my company in less than 2 years using the service. We occasionally have orders in excess of $40k most of our orders are in the $5-$15K range.
They won't tell me why. The resolution center is asking for invoice, PO, customer, and bank statement information. Basically it sound like they want to make sure we are a legitimate business.
It wouldn't be so frustrating except I've gone through this twice before. It's really annoying. I shouldn't have to show them proof that my business is legit, mostly because I've done it before.
I could understand if we were a brand new customer but having had a history it doesn't make sense that they would do this again.

I guess I'm not sure what you're getting at. Fully digital doesn't necessarily mean crypto (I think it will). For longer than we like it will probably be these other methods that are digital and not crypto.

Why shouldn't he/she be able to say that here? This doesn't need to be adversarial. If he/she made the wrong choice and BCH ends up low in price or dead has that helped you in some way?

because I used it for awhile before I got a hardware wallet and it worked well, they had good support, and it was an easy transition from being a newbie on coinbase to a different wallet. It's not the best wallet out there but it's safer than an exchange. it was like step 1.5 instead of going straight to 2 in evolution.
Edit: also because I couldn't get mycellium on IOS.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:26:28
No, coinbase or any exchange are NOT BANKS, they are NOT protected with FDIC like banks. If they get hacked or shut down or whatever your coins are lost.
If you can't get a hardware wallet download Bread or Mycellium and put your coins there. No matter what you do keep them off the exchange. Nothing good can come from it.

@_date: 2017-09-14 11:50:27
I think you're being idealistic and perhaps a little naive. In the case of Fire protection I'll give it to you that could potentially work. What about roads, water, police, garbage etc. 
There will be people that won't want to pay for these services and ultimately it will make prices for those that do go much much higher and eventually it could devolve into a scenario where too few people are paying and it won't be feasible to employ other people to do the jobs.
I know this can be looked at as the "worst case scenario" but trusting in the good of other people to pay there share on there own is a tricky thing and could go wrong.
I'm no fan of over taxation but I'm also not ready to trust that everyone would pay there share.

I think your concerns are warranted, I have a relatively small position in bitcoin so I'm definitely not in a worrisome position.
I think what we're seeing is growing pains.
There's definitively a divide on what people think Bitcoin is/can/should be.
In another thread a few days ago I had a long drawn out discussion/argument with people that want bitcoin to create a serious revolution where we live in a society that doesn't pay taxes but somehow still functions as it does today. Trying to wrap my head around that scenario gave me a headache.

Look, i get that you want bitcoin to be some revolution into a system where there is no tax and everyone lives happily somehow, tell me how exactly all of that plays out? Once taxation stops where do all of these things come from?
Social programs that are paid for by tax money benefit EVERYONE. An educated populace does more for the common good than you can imagine. For every dollar spent in the space program fourteen are returned to the economy, the space program is paid for by taxes it just doesn't happen. This isn't stealing, it was stealing before the American Revolution when we were taxed without representation. Now it is a social contract that you make with your government that they provide you with services:
Fire Department (not everywhere has volunteer fire departments, in fact most cities don't)
Garbage Pickup
Snow Removal
 
This is a small portion of services that you would have to bargain for on your own merits, which by the way you would most certainly be price gouged on.
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:57:18
I mean taxation helps pay for public roads, services, parks, etc. to claim that it's outright theft is wrong.

No way to host it yourself on the website to stream with btc payment? I don't know a ton about e-commerce but that feels like it would be pretty simple.
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:29:04
They're also asking how to get it, which honestly for me has been what's stopped me from jumping on the bandwagon. From my small amount of research I can tell that Bitcoin is clearly the future of currency and commerce, but there does not seem to be an easy way to get it where I feel secure that it won't be stolen.

It also needs better bank integration for buying coins, it only supports 16 banks
