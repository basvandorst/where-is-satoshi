As I describe, it just reveals the high degree of impotent rage
If that is what is intended, it does achieve it. Its cringeworthy, and im surprized none of you shills have woken up to this fact yet

I'm using a new account because my original account was shadowbanned from Reddit.
I was shadowbanned because the mods of coin sent a request to the Adkins; they were incensed at my expressed opinions and decided to censor dissent.
Fortunately I have infinite IPs, so they are powerless to stop me, beyond constantly banning my accounts

'Neckbeard is a pejorative term referring to unattractive, overweight and misogynistic internet users who wear a style of facial hair in which a majority of the growth is present on the chin and neck.'
'Fedora guy can be anyone with a really obvious and ridiculous affectation that makes him look more like the immature dork he is than the imaginary worldly and mature non-dork he sees himself as.'
The more you know!
Btw, sounds like you're of the fedora category
