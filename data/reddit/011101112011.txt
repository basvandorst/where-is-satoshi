The recommended fee at the time you made your tx was 100sat/byte. You paid 20. That's the reason it never cleared.
Whenever I do a tx I juts check what's in the mempool. Not sure how all the different wallets figure out the tx fee - but I've seen many that are too low and many that are too high.

LN with atomic swaps could support an arbitrary amount of cryptocurrencies. Pay with whatever coin you want. Receive in whatever coin you want. 
It makes no sense to think of it as LN-BTC vs LN-LTC. It's just LN(all).
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:57:16
It could happen, yes. LN is the meta medium of exchange that all segwit coins can use *and* it allows exchange between the coins.
So no need for centralized exchange anymore so long as it's crypto-to-crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:53:38
BTC remains the store of value. LN implementation performs the function of "medium of exchange". Any coins can be used as a medium of exchange, but not all coins are a stable store of value.
The more decentralized hashing power there is, the larger the store of value (meaning the most costly it is to attack that store of value). 
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:28:26
No need to predict anything - the price is the point at which a buyer and a seller agree to exchange at.
My price to sell my bitcoins, for example, is not a penny short of $100,000 each. So it means I might be waiting a while or even until 2019 to find buyers. No rush though.

Each input is 180 bytes (+1/-1), each output is 34 bytes, and each tx includes 10 bytes. For compressed pub keys it's 32 bytes less for the input.
AFAIK fees are not an output you have to pay for. Otherwise you would pay fees on top of fees.

So long as it is segwit enabled, with atomic swaps it can happen.
The thing is, that newly created coin needs to have a published conversion rate that is agreed upon, and in that case, it will be worthless. Sure you can mine a billion of them, but when 1 billion of them is only worth 2 satoshi, it means it is still worthless.

There is no such thing as intrinsic value when comparing a limited supply of one thing to potentially unlimited supply of another thing.
There are plenty of models you could use to calculate it - but it depends entirely on your models, and how sane they are.
If you look at Global GPD of developed countries on a large enough time scale, what you see is exponential growth. 
Technological advancement allows for growth - that is certain. The first great growths were all due to technological advancement in agriculture - before that the GDP was purely dependent on population and sunlight.
The sustainability of growth is simply dependent on the ability of technology to provide for a growing population. You may as well say we are in an economic and technological bubble, because we are able to artificially sustain a population that is higher than should be allowed if one took away technology. So long as we can have the technology to sustain population growth, there is no potential upper limit to growth.
So how do you value a resource that is finite, in the face of an economy that can continue growing, and can continue to add to its own GDP? Do you sell your 1BTC now for $15,000, or in 2 years for $100,000, or in 20 years for $20 million?
If something has an intrinsic value, then that value will not change. Maybe each BTC is worth 1/21millionth of global GPD across all human history as to include all potential future growth.

The buyer doesn't need to worry about any of it - neither does the merchant. Atomic swaps would happen at whatever the accepted published conversion rate it. In reality, the atomic swap is part of a function of incorporating exchanges - it's zero fee. The only thing is that there has to be a demand for it, but that shouldn't be an issue at all. 
The buyer doesn't have to be even aware of what currency the seller accepts - they can choose to pay with whatever currency they want, and the buyer inevitable receives that which they accept.

If they believed the product would bring them &amp; their shareholders a good return, they would invest, even if in the long run it would stifle growth.
Unfortunately, quarterly gains drive a large % of publicly traded companies.
I don't know the reality of how risk averse bankers and VC's really are - certainly VC's take on massive risks, as they tend to invest in a very wide array of startups knowing that undoubtedly at least *some* will pan out and give amazing returns while the rest just fail. Banks like to pretend they are risk averse when it comes to trifling matters such as customer loans, but the reality is that bank of all sorts are nothing short of branches of a larger system which sets the tolerable levels of risk according to the field... the banks themselves have little to nothing to do with any of it.
If we learned anything about the housing market crash is that investment companies value profit over all things - even to the point of dealing with levels of risk that no sane person would touch with ~~a 100 foot pole~~ 160.00 bananas.

No. You're missing the point completely.
It can be flooded all they want, with 100 million tx's @ 0 fee, but that will not matter if people are using LN to do instant tx's between LN users on LN channels.

If LN adoption, then bitcoin mempool / tx traffic = irrelevant, because LN users are not waiting on blockchain to confirm anything.
The only instance where it matters is in the opening / closing of channels. Apart from that the traffic on the blockchain has no bearing or effect on the LN.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:19:15
Bigger blocks are the equivalent of adding more roads to deal with traffic. Long term it never works, it's a short term fix.
Say we do 10mb blocks, and give an immediate 10x capacity. How long until that's not enough and we need 100mb blocks? 1gb?

Imagine a bunch of large payment processor hubs that all route stuff in between them. So like banks, credit card companies, etc.
Each user only really needs 1 channel - between them and *any* of the large hubs. Ideally a channel stays open indefinitely - although I can imagine some dystopian future where LN is ubiquitous and the hubs are all powerful, to the point of blacklisting users that are political activists, etc.... which means they are screwed because the tx to close a channel is more than what they can afford.
*IF* bitcoin becomes big enough, believe me it will be used as a tool against the common man. LN is enabling this - I think, but who knows, it could turn out well too.

Can be any. The lender can stipulate the period in advance, or can request to be paid with little to no notice. No one knows how it's all gonna work yet. In general though, with traditional markets, the lenders never force the positions to close, because they don't want to scare investors away, but those companies also have huge quantities of stocks available for shorting.
Likely at this point only exchanges will have the kind of bitcoin needed in order to allow shorting. I highly doubt that individuals will be allowed to lend for shorting on their own terms, but exchanges may set up pools for shorting from which individuals can partake in on the exchanges terms.
This means that even with prices rising, individuals will not be able to force shorters to close their positions - which of course would be beneficial for those lending out the bitcoin, but not those shorting it.
Likely it will inject more instability and uncertainty, and we will see some wild price spikes along the way.
It's also a possible scam, as bankrupt exchanges have a way now to essentially bail themselves out, at the expense of those who have funds on the exchanges.

I get it. I don't think the psychological barrier of 1BTC is beneficial, because you might be chasing it forever. Just buy what you can.
It's like saying the goal is to own 1 share of Berkshire Hathaway. The problem being that 1 share is worth $300,000 right now, and by the time you save up that amount, it might be worth twice that.
Then again, the vast majority of people cannot afford or will ever be able to afford to get a single share of Berkshire Hathaway - so that's why they also offer fractional shares.
The important thing is that the fractional shares also increase in value the same % as the full price shares - so if someone wants to, they can still benefit from the % increases without having to own a full share.
Is there prestige in saying you own X amount of shares in Berkshire Hathaway? Hell yeah. But that's an ego thing. 
My point is, looking at owning a full share of Berkshire Hathaway can be discouraging, as the goal posts are so far away and they keep moving. So it's simply not beneficial to chase that dream, but you can still benefit from the growth of the stock, by buying part shares.
Same deal with bitcoin. 
Buy what you can, and don't focus on how much bitcoin you have, but rather what it's worth.

The unconfirmed transactions screw up the temporary accounting.
Once they drop off the final balance will be 0.
It's pretty easy to do - send an amount with little or no fee, and then send it again with a higher fee. The higher fee one gets confirmed, but the lower fee one does not, but blockchain will see 2 spends which creates a negative balance, until the lower fee one gets rejected.

Lightning is one type of solution, yes. It has it's own potential issues still though.
Delaying the inevitable by increasing blocksize and hoping for future devs to solve a problem is not a long term solution.
VISA can do a theoretical max of 56,000 tx / second - that's 33.6 million tx every 10 minutes. For a block to hold that we would need around 13.5GB blocks. Every 10 minutes.
Currently VISA is averaging around 2000tx / second - that's 1.2 million tx every 10 minutes. For a block to hold that we would need around 600MB blocks.
I personally think the best solution is a 1mb block every 10 minutes that serves as a clearing house for sidechains / counterparties / etc.
Whatever it is that happens at this point with bitcoin has to remain extremely conservative - which means that fast moving new developmental ideas are in the real of altcoins.
What are some things altcoins do that achieve faster transaction times and lower transaction fees that can be used by bitcoin without negatively impacting the kind of security that the bitcoin blockchain provides?

Well, "bitcoin" cannot be trademarked, and the logo cannot be copyrighted. So whoever owns the domain can do whatever the hell the want.

It's the closest thing there is to an "official" site - although it does mention that there cannot technically be an official site, since it's all open source and decentralized anyway.
Bitcoin.**com** is owned by a shady fella using a numbered company incorporated in a tax haven, who made a bunch of different alt-coins that failed, and he is behind bitcoin-cash, which is now the 5th altcoin he has made.
He used to be involved with the real bitcoin in the past, but for a bunch of reasons he decided there was better money to be made by creating altcoins and basically pumping the hype behind them.

Basic income would need to be set up so that the system cannot be gamed - thus you would need to send X amount to each person, and not each address.
This means a centralized authority to oversee it using some other scheme, such as what countries use to itemize their citizens (Social Security Number, etc). *That* very concept is somewhat anti-blockchain, but realistically there is no reason why there cannot be varying levels of centralization within side chains.
Then you have to consider what is funding it?
Maybe in a system where some amount of government revenue was deposited into one bitcoin address, you could have a sidechain pegged to that address, that then pays out citizens on a monthly basis using that sidechained altcoin that is legislated to be legal in that country, in such a way as to take into account the relative value of bitcoin at the time of each payperiod. The bitcoin becomes a proof of fund or a reserve that backs the altcoin - so the total market cap of that altcoin is equal to the value of the bitcoin held in that reserve address.
Of course the coin off of which the side chain is used has to be hard pegged to the value of bitcoin, otherwise all sorts of issues with hyper inflation / hyper deflation can occur if suddenly the government decides that some sort of cryptographical quantitative easing is necessary because it needs X% inflation in order to spur growth or whatever.
That altcoin is used for all commerce, and is taxed, which goes back into a government owned altcoin address, from which it replenishes it's altcoin funds used for the guaranteed income.
So it can work, in theory, in a very broad way. Probably some major loopholes exist though, especially since you need a central authority, which means your altcoins are a fiat and not decentralized consensus driven.

Scaling by introducing larger blocksizes is always just fixing the immediate problem but not the underlying problem. It buys time, at a cost.
What happens when the blocks are 1GB in size? or 1TB? 
There is an upper limit at which things cannot function anymore, so you can buy time until then.
Obviously the solution is not to change max block size or block time.
Read the whitepaper. The idea is that other coins / sidechains can exist which fulfill some function.
Bitcoin remains the blockchain that back everything else.
You may be interested in things such as lightning network.
Anyway, solutions exist. B-cash is *not* a solution. It's an outright copy (fork) of bitcoin with 1 thing changed - blocksize, but offers nothing new - and eventually whatever blocksize they propose will either be found to be too small, or the size would grow to the point where the system is too bloated.

The same reason the average joe cannot run a full node is the same reason they wont run an LN (bandwidth costs - guaranteed uptime).
LN light clients is the only way it will reach adoption - otherwise the total nodes is hard limited to the total amount of people running full blockchain nodes.
Businesses will naturally be hubs - but well funded mega hubs will have an incentive - earning fees. Ordinary users are not going to set up dozens or hundreds of channels - simply due to costs, and really there is no need for them - one channel is enough. The very basic idea of LN leads to centralized mega hubs - the network theory / "6 degrees of separation" relies on hubs. 
There is incentive towards hubs. It's an element of self organization that prioritizes overall efficiency.
It's the same reasons we don't have an internet that is just each computer user haphazardly connected to each other user and instead we have a truncated pyramid of content delivery networks and servers serving other servers with dedicated oceanic channels.
Point is - centralization is inevitable.
Now the question is, what does centralization bring? 
Lets look for an example: what has centralization brought in bitcoin? How did things change between when people were all mining solo with their CPU's, to pools being set up to group mine, to companies pushing the cutting edge with asic chip manufacturing, to state sponsored energy rebate programs and dedicated mining?
It's brought in centralization of *profit*, and with it, more and more control of the direction of bitcoin, overall, to those who have the power to derive profit. Many legitimate altcoins are founded on the premise to undermine this, because they disagree with it, but that's another topic entirely.
The initially tiny fees of LN will give way to ever increasing fees as mega bugs figure out operating costs. So long as the fees stay below the fees needed to either close the channel or open a new one, users will have to begrudgingly accept the idea that maybe LN is charging them the equivalent to 300s/b *but* they would pay 350s/b if they were to push it to the blockchain.
It ends up being a trap then. Sure, you can close the channel and get control of your funds back, but then you would need to open *another* LN channel just to get back in the game - and surprise surprise, megahubs are the only player in town that has guaranteed uptime. Why connect to some unknown home user as your only channel into the LN network? Then you are placing yourself at their uptime mercy.
I could go on forever with potential future issues. I think LN is a great step - but for whatever reason no one ever seems to want to discuss any potential issues it may have. Too much utopian milk and honey at this point

Anyone that hold bitcoins benefits from forks... even though the alts are probably all doomed to fail and most are created for quick cash grab reasons to begin with.
Between bgold, bcash, and bitcore, anyone could have made instant 30% increase in their bitcoin holdings overnight - I sure did.
I found out about those from users on this sub - but I wish I would have known earlier, to get as much advantage as possible. Very relevant to bitcoin holders IMO.
2 new forks coming out soon  - diamond-b and super-b... have potential to once again increase BTC holdings. Maybe another 10% increase in holdings. Can't complain about that! It benefits literally anyone that holds bitcoins *and* holds their own keys. Only people who would be against that either have no bitcoins, or do not hold their own keys - so they can only blame themselves for missing out on the free BTC.

I can't seem to figure out what you are trying to ask.
I suggest you go and read the whitepaper. It's all laid out there nice and simple.
Those using LN are not effected by the tx fees on the blockchain, except in instances where they are opening or closing channels, but that would be about as common as how often people open / close chequing accounts with their bank.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:57:44
It's calculated as satoshis/byte. The overall fee is determined on the size of the transaction, and not the amount being transacted.
Thus if you send from a single address, the size is small. If you send from many addresses, the size is larger.

If lightning can do crosschain atomic swaps, and AFAIK they have done btc/ltc swap on testnets, then it's a game changer.
Users are free to spend whatever coin they want for goods / services, and retailers can request whatever coin they want as well, and everything works under the hood.
The issue then is going to be there is not going to be any real need for a bunch of alts that essentially do the same thing bitcoin already does, and the differences in features of the alts (block time, block size, etc etc...) are meaningless, because they exist outside the LN.
Ultimately though, the question will arise: which implementation of the blockchain is the best store of value? Or put another way, which coins blockchain has the most mining / hashing power behind it? That's gonna be king, because it will provide the most possible security to act as a proven reserve for LN.
Other alts that have other intended functions (smart contracts, etc), remain valid, because they have potential real world uses that focus on other areas of programmable money, but essentially LN with atomic swaps would fulfill the role of a MoE (medium of exchange) in such a way that all alts that try to be a competing store of value with bitcoin suddenly have no real purpose. That part is a numbers game. Largest hashing power = largest store of value, simply due to having the largest cost to attack that store of value (the cost of sustained 51% attack).
With atomic swaps, it only matters what the way to buy in (channel creation) is, as far as which coin you are using. 
Once inside the LN, the actual unit of currency is meaningless as transactions are ubiquitous irregardless of what the coin type the local wallet user thinks they are using, or what they used to open a channel.
So what that leads to is a scenario where you probably will have as many different altcoins as there are mining algorithms, simply because the role of the coins is delegated to being simply a store of value, and naturally those coins which demonstrate the best store of value are naturally safer than those that do not.

Asicboost is a method whereby 20% - 30% efficiency increases in sha256 occur by using a system to process that data before it is hashed, as well as by tweaking some things during hashing.
It was developed by a math / cryptography researcher Dr Timo Hanke (
Bitmain, hearing of this, integrated the ideas into their asic designs, and then submitted a patent for the exact same thing, in China. China's patent laws are a joke basically. Patents are something that the "west" does. China just takes what works without regard to red tape - and that is the norm for the most part.
Asicboost works on bitcoin, as well as bcash. The issue is that asicboost was not compatible with any of the recent bitcoin protocol soft forks, so there was massive pressure from bitmain the put those softforks in negative light. In this they succeeded by making sure there was not the consensus required for those soft forks.
Of course, bitmain is the largest asic manufacturer in the world. They also own the 2 largest bitcoin mining pools.

* "Size of blockchain is issue".
Not everyone needs to run full node. Light clients exist.
*  "Cannot scale". 
Segwit, LN. Solutions exist. The idea of it having to solve scaling solutions in the future was part of the design. "Sidechains". Read the white paper by Satoshi. He foresaw this in the beginning.
* "No help desk / fraud detection"
Decentralized trust does not need fraud detection - it's built in. Open source.  Exchanges, etc, need fraud protection / help desk - but *that* is not bitcoin - that's just another business.
* "Transaction delay"
LN, sidechains with different block times. Ways to solve this. The thing is, not *every* payment needs to be instant. If I'm paying my mortgage or phone bill, all that matters is that it gets there in some reasonable time before the deadline. Basically prioritizing payments means that I want to be able to pay for me coffee instantly, but for other things, 10 minutes, or 10 hours or even 1 day is no issue. Just depends on the payment type.
* "Willingness of miners will go down as block rewards decrease"
Hence fees making up a larger % of mining revenue over time. Again, this is by design. Obviously this "expert" has not even read the white paper.
* "Bitcoin is a wonderful technology waiting for someone to invent it's true killer application"
The true killer app is blockchaintech. No one has really figured out what to do with it just yet, on a truly global scale. If BTC becomes the reserve cryptocurrency, such as what LN has in mind, the true "killer app" will be the complete overhauling and revolution of the financial system, on a scale that has never existed before.

The question is how certain are you of the password - and how many possible combinations can there be.
There was a guy on here a few weeks ago that knew like 90% of his password that was bip38 encrypted. I wrote a quick and dirty script to output possible combinations - came up with around 1/2million possibilities. I mean, you could then rent amazon / google computational power to run all those bip38 tests. Anyway never heard back from him - maybe he remembered it after all.
Creating code to generate password combinations is very easy - but creating code to then bruteforce those is more complex.
Some of the bruteforce programs I know of... hashcat... johntheripper.... search google for those to find more. The issue, of course, is going to be how those programs can interface with whatever wallet you are working with.

I love how this chart has been posted daily online in various forums since the days when bitcoin was &gt;$1.
It might be right *eventually*, at which point all naysays can *finally* proclaim: "Aha! **I WAS RIGHT**."

Yup. Close to 50% of their nodes are hosted by one entity, likely bitmain. I think we know the reasoning behind that - purely because the bcash protocol supports asicboost, which bitmain is using illegally. But then again there are no real patent laws in china. Surprise surprise none of the soft forks that would get rid of asicboost have had any support.
At least another 20% are hosted on centralized amazon servers. I see google severs in the list as well, but I think it's a generous estimate to say that only 20% of the nodes are actually real decentralized nodes.
They have good propaganda, I will give them that. Reminds me of donald trump fanboys here on reddit - a massive echochamber. Like that image of bart simpson walking around banging a pot stating "I am so great, I am so great...."
At the end of the day though, all they got is market speculation fueled by hype, similar to many other alt-coins. 
The one thing they did different though than other alts is start a shit throwing contest. So there you go, the game has changed. Propaganda in crypto has become normalized.
One must wonder though, if they believe what they say, how come the NYSE, CBOE, and CME decided on bitcoin futures / eft's, and not bcash? If bcash is so much better why does coinbase and gdax suddenly have to institute new rules to treat bcash with kiddy gloves, pausing markets and such to stop sell offs? And how does that chime with their cult leaders idea that markets should not be regulated at all?
It's all gonna come out in the wash eventually.
Either it kills bitcoin, or makes it stronger. Which is a good thing. But bcash does not represent an actual threat nor an innovation, since it has false support.

Block size limit was introduced because of the discrepancy that certain miners may produce blocks larger than other miners may accept, and allow DDOS of the network, so essentially *some* limit had to be set. This was 1MB, and was set at a time where average blocks were nowhere near that point yet. Before this, there was no limit.
That size was set as a lower limit in order to maximize propagation speed, so that the average home miner / node runner could actually successfully help the network.
Full 8MB blocks, for example, require 15mbit minimum upstream to propagate seamlessly.
It was set to be able to be changed in the future, but for various reasons, it has not yet changed.

The patent seems to be an exchange that uses crypto / blockchain tech in order to run the exchange. I'm guessing they would run some in-house crypto &amp; blockchain specially designed to do this. It's basically just programmable side chains - nothing new.
The overly broad thing about it is that it describes simple concepts such as using processors and/or memory to do this, and, as far as I can tell, represents nothing new. 
Makes no sense why they would be awarded the patent, but then again american patent system is horribly broken.

Bcash's whole platform is the american politician methodology: try to gain favor by attacking others.
It's literally catering to those who are swayed by the most basic emotional manipulation and confusion. 
This sub has it's fair share of mania and reactionary trollism - it's always been here in fact. Probably will always remain. Back when bitcoinforums was the only game in town it was already over run by trolls - so it's not some "new phenomenon" that exists because of bcash or anything like that. Bitcoin had that in the very beginning, and likely will always have it. 
Most other altcoin subs have projects they work on, roadmaps for developers, testing bleeding edge new ideas, etc. Bcash sub has what? Them spinning their own hype, and the constant "we are the *real* bitcoin trope, but nothing of substance. 
Anyway, a few weeks or a few months, whatever it will take, it will die down, and join the ranks of b-gold, b-platinum, b*etc. Who knows, Roger &amp; Co may start yet another hardfork altcoin, which of course this time will be the *real* **real** bitcoin.

Sounds like your node is not properly configured. I'm guessing max peers set at 8. 
Should be around 50GB+ / day when properly configured.  
You are just receiving blocks but not doing anything to help the network. 
It's not just an issue with data caps, but with bandwidth available. I think many people don't have access. I have unlimited - $105 at 150up 15 down, but reading from reddit it seems that many people in the USA simply don't have that kind of access available. To them, LN is out of their reach.

Use "electron-cash" wallet from  and verify checksums from 
Import your BTC private keys into that wallet that used to hold the BTC - it will create a new tx that will redeem your bcash at a 1:1 ratio of what BTC you held when it forked. Make sure those priv keys do not hold anymore BTC - if they do, send them to a new, fresh BTC address first.
Then head on over to any of the exchanges that have bcash-BTC trading, sell, and withdraw your BTC from the exchange.

A wallet can control several addresses. Say you have 2 addresses with 1BTC each. Your wallet shows you have 2BTC. Now if you send 2BTC, then your transaction is using 2 addresses (private keys) to send that full amount, so the transaction is bigger, and you pay more fees.
Also, if you received lots of very small payments in the past to one address, and now you are sending a larger payment that is an aggregate of many smaller payment, the fee is again larger, because the data size of the transaction is also larger, because it needs to send many "small" payments, to make up one large payment.
In the future, when that person spends that larger payment that was a sum of your many small payments, their fees will be small - because they are just referencing one single payment that is being spent, but in your case, you are referencing many payments that are being spent.

One may consider what the end game or limit cases are of big block solutions.
Assume we want a system where everyone in the world has equal access to fast payments, such as what VISA allows for us here in the west.
Let's run some numbers:
    Average daily VISA tx/s: 2000tx
    % of tx types that are credit card: 20%
    # Of credit cards, globally: 2.1 Billion
    Mean credit cards / person: 3.7
    Global population: 7.6 billion
    Global % of people who have credit cards: 7.5%
    Average tx/s if everyone globally had credit cards: 27000tx
    Average bitcoin tx size: 500 bytes
    Average 10 minute block size if everyone had access to credit cards: 300mb
    Average 10 minute block size of everyone used blockchain for all tx types: 1.5GB
**So the thing to take away from this, is that if everyone globally was using a blockchain for all their transactions, we would need around 1.5GB blocks, every 10 minutes.**
At what point, between 1MB and 15GB blocks, does network latency / bandwidth availability have an effect? 
The larger the blocksize, the more centralization occurs, as the access to both mining and running a full node suddenly only remains accessible for less and less people. Only those that are well funded, have excellent access to bandwidth, cheap storage costs, and lowest latency, are able to maintain the network.
Even something modest such as 8mb block ends up cutting out the vast majority of people who *currently* have bandwidth access *if* the blocks were full. Running a fully saturated 8MB node:
    Requires minimum 40mbit connection
    Requires Minimum 12TB / month data plan
    8 times larger miner block send / receive latency
The larger miner latency means that, as block size grows, miners will work on empty blocks proportionally longer. Miners begin working on new blocks immediately after they have received a new block, but before they verify the full block.
This is why when you see two block quickly in a row, the second block is empty. The larger the block size allowed, the longer that window of time for another empty block to occur.
    
Bigger blocks are not a realistic solution, as they kick the can down the road and ultimately produce centralization.

The minimum cost of running LN is the same as all the associated costs with running a full bitcoin node + the tx fees to create channels.
Running bitcoin full node on a rpi is fine - because if you drop off the network it has no effect, but being a node in the LN with a rpi is stupid, because if/when you drop off due to hitting your data caps, or due to hardware failure, those that use you as their only access to the LN are also cut off.
Point being, there is a certain incentive to connect to types of nodes which will become the megahubs, which are those users who have: good hardware with backups in place, uncapped plans or commercial plans, and enough funding to be able to set up multiple channels.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:01:41
Each node can set its mempool limit. 
The default I believe is 300MB - but many users run a higher limit.
Means your tx will stay in their mempool and be rebroadcasted. When eventually those who run 300MB mempool have room, they too will include your tx and rebroadcast it as well.

Set up an electron cash wallet, not using your old seed. Just a brand new seed. This creates a brand new electron cash wallet.
Once you have that brand new wallet set up, you sweep (import) the individual private keys that hold (or held) bitcoin, using the private keys you exported from the electrm (bitcoin) wallet. When you do this it creates a transaction that sends the bitcoin cash into the new address you had made.

Honestly first step is securing at least $1M in startup funds so you can get the latest ASIC miners as they hit the market.
You can still mine at home using GPU's and such, so long as you mine alt-coins.
When I setup my first gpu mining home operation in 2012-2013 my all in cost was somewhere around $10,000. By end of 2014 I was pulling in less than $1 / day. This was on 16 7970's. The same hardware would net me around $0.02 in bitcoin a day nowadays. This was with free electricity in my 2 bedroom apartment, and the operation was running my 15 and 20 amp circuits at 80% load.
To combat the noise / heat issue, I converted the balcony to an outdoor data center.
In prettymuch all cases you are better off using the funds you would spend on setting up mining to just buy bitcoins directly. 
If you have a bunch of modern cards laying around you might want to check out  ... it will at least give you some idea of what mining is like. AFAIK gpu mining on pools is prettymuch dead nowadays for bitcoin at least.

They will issue tokens that they control that are at a 1:1 ratio with bitcoin. These tokens will see mass adoption across other banks and money transfer institutions such as visa, interac, etc. This will spur massive adoption with retailers.

Wanting to move around a small sum today to separate my btc from btc-cash... several hours now without confirmation.
Have fees @ 0.007BTC... right around $50USD. 
Honestly this is retarded.

Myself I download the latest version of a live bootable linux when I need it. Might not be bleeding edge up to date, but certainly recent enough. Of course, any major patches and such are usually included in whatever latest version of the distro, so there are no issues there.
You could also look into an actually hardened distros, or at least start running things in virtual machines, so even if you somehow get a targeted keylog attack via some malicious script specifically designed for you while browsing, it's in its own virtual container and can never infect your system.
Keeping things on separate partitions means it's no issue to do updates whenever you want.
Realistically, I think you would need to create different levels of security. You say you own all sorts of alt-coins, but I would think that securing your bitcoins would be the most important thing, right?
For those it's trivially easy to just paper wallet them - and I think with many alt coins that method would work too.

I get it. And that hardware houses a piece of software which does the actual work.
In that case, one may as well just store in paper wallets and use the software of their choosing when the want to spend, and not even need a hardware wallet.
In my mind it's a middle man that is not required and doesn't add any extra security but does pose extra potential problems.

Do you mean you sent 1 bitcoin or 1 "bitcoin cash"? Bitcoin cash (the alt-coin) did not yet exist in september 2017.
Did you send the bitcoin to a wallet / address you control?

Oh you are right I had it confused with bitcoin gold.
Do you have the latest firmware updated?

Anything that stores value has value, but only so long as it has something to store. Is the value a function of the contents, or a function of the storage? Can one exist without the other? No.
There is no difference between a store of value and a currency - they are interchangeable. Currencies are just traded stores of value.

Download bitaddress from github (
Next you want to run that on an offline computer that is safe - ideally you set up a linux live boot usb that also contains those bitaddress files you downloaded from github. 
You live boot into the linux, on a computer that is not connected to the internet, and when it's loaded (should take less than a minute even on an old system) you run the *bitaddress.org/html* file.
It will generate a paper wallet without ever connecting to the internet. Since you know you are in a clean system, and no network connection, there is no way anyone could know about the addresses you generate - unless there is a hidden camera or something behind you. All the address generation takes place on your computer. The file you run (the website) is just a script to generate it all.
What I usually do is hook up one of my old printers at this point and print out the addresses and QR codes I generated. 
Then disconnect the printer, shut down the linux live usb, and boot back into windows or whatever. There are no traces left of anything you had done.
For large sums, I have multiple copies of the same paper wallet, and some get stored in different locations, in case my house burns down or something.
Also, you can further encrypt your paper wallets  with BIP38 - so even if someone finds / steals you paper wallet, it's absolutely useless to them without the password.

You bitcoin cash would be associated with an address that held bitcoin at the end of october 2017. 
1. Send your bitcoin to a new bitcoin wallet. The bitcoin cash remains on the old wallet, and the bitcoin is now on a new wallet.
2. Using Electron cash, make a new default wallet.
3. Sweep your old wallet keys into electron cash. This will make a new transaction that sends your bitcoin cash into your electron cash wallet.
4. Sell on an exchange. I used Kraken and Bitfinex, but use whatever works.
Also, after this, your old wallet also contains bitcoin gold. You can do the same thing, but use a different wallet for that. I used coinomi to get my bitcoin gold.
Between bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold, you can easily increase your bitcoin holding by 20%, by selling those alt coins for bitcoin.

Get your private keys off the android device using the following:
or something like this:  (suggest running that site offline btw).
Once you have the private keys, download electron-cash ( generate a new wallet, and then select wallet:privatekeys:sweep, and sweep in the private keys you got off your phone.
Unfortunately, that bitcoin wallet is crap - does not show you your private keys.

Maybe they updated the firmware or whatever and it's no longer backwards compatible with the original seed, which OP says used to work.
Putting your trust in hardware is the same as you not holding your coins. 
For all the solutions hardware storage provides it introduces new methods of failure.

Even if you consider that you are taxed on the converted value of your BTC at the point of buying a product or selling your bitcoins, the issue is what exchange do you use to determine the actual FIAT worth for taxation purposes?
Unless each government that has set up a taxation policy sets an official exchange that can be used as a reference point, there is no way to get an exact number that everyone can agree on.
For taxation purposes, in Canada, you are taxed on 50% of the difference between your buy point and sell point, in such a way that it is added to your yearly income, and whatever tax bracket you fall into is how you are taxed.
The issue being, I can just say that the bitcoin I just sold for $6000 Canadian I had bought yesterday at an ATM, so I can say that I didn't actually make any money on it, and the was no gain.
The receipts these ATM's give out are the cheap heat activated paper type - they fade to nothing in a matter of a week (or even less if in direct sunlight), and you can buy / sell without anything more than a burner cell phone.

I just checked one of my first wallets, when I was mining with a 5850. 0.1BTC / day in 2013. I think I picked up that card for around $120.
By then end of 2014 / early 2015, I was making only 0.0035BTC / day - with 8 7950's, and 4 5850's. The 7950's were around $400 each.
Sold off the rest of the cards in 2015 - still have the original 5850 though.
I wonder how different things will be in another 5 years.
