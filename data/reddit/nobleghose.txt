Might be a late reply. But it's just a tool. Somebody's is good at using tools, while others are good at creating them. However, I would not recommend to buy this software using the link OP provided, as there are cheaper options to get this software.
This might answer some questions regarding "cheaper options":

GunBot is good, yet insanely overpriced. So unless you want to pay a full price and have absolutely no benefits from that - I'd recommend you to look for alternative ways to obtain this software.
We can offer GunBot  for just 0.04 BTC with few solid bonuses:
* All exchanges enabled
* Sjakil's GUI bundled for free (costs $75+);
* TradingView plugin enabled (v5+)
* New version updates included
