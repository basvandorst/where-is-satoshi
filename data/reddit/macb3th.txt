Yes, I agree. But if I find my BTC partner happens to be a lying Russian Mafioso, and I'm carrying cash. That's something to worry about.
Ok, nerds and geeks are not the type. But it doesn't take much for a scumbag to "involve" himself in a gentlemans transaction.

Is SEPA available in the UK though? I checked all my banks and there is no mention of it. Perhaps because it's all GBP. The free transfers are BACS (3 days) and InstantPay (sameday - so within 8 hours or so).
Having said that, even with the UK friendly exchanges that require passport and address verification, I have found localbitcoins seems to have much cheaper suppliers anyway than the other exchanges.
Mt.Gox. would cost me a SWIFT transfer as I don't see anyway to do a SEPA from my UK banks. Thats around £30. Then they charge an incoming transfer anyway of 1000 Yen (another £7). 
I am now worried that I have sent my passport and address to scammers.

When I was using 56kbps (actually 33kbps now I remember), we had a brilliant little app on the Amiga called Roxbox. You called it up any time and dialled a foreign, usually south american, 800 freephone international exchange. You had to time it right so that before the 800 operator answered you send a funny little "kerchink" tone into the handset which played with the old System X technology of the exchanges. Then Roxbox would have a list of all your favourite warez BBS's to hand and would dial them using internal exchange routing frequencies.
Result - thousands of hours of international UK to USA free calls and loads of warez trading. Fucking hell it was fun.
(And this was when the bastard telcos tried to rip everyone of with $2/minute international calls)

Yes, I am thinking of wiring over £1k over, and now I have to find out about this SEPA think and pay £50 or so, then should be good to go.
But my reasoning as an investor in crypto-currency is that it should be fluid. BTC is not at all fluid and has a high barrier to entry. This means it will not be taken up by the masses. Who on earth would pay £50 in charges when they only need £10 in BTC?. This will be the death of it, unless the bankers sort out a decent BTC exchange.
Believe me, I want an independant non-fiat currency like BTC or Gold to work. There just seems to be a massive barrier to entry. Also, is VAT or Sales Tax applied on BTC transactions? (I hope not. In fact I can't see how they could do it!). But the charges probably wipe out the tax advantage.

How is Mt.Gox a part of SEPA, it is a Japanese Company as far as I know.

But if you don't even take a phone, never mind a laptop, what kind of verification is there?
I guess meeting in a library means you can use their computers which seems fair enough.
It still all seems kind of seedy though.

Anyone carrying £10,000+ in cash is an instant easy mugging victim, and always was before bitcoin too. Believe me life is cheap to the vast majority of the planet. Think Scallies, Chavs, Pikies, Gypsies, etc.
I wouldn't dream of meeting a random stranger and handing over 10k large, unless I had at least two fucking hard mates with me.

Hehe.. My first acid experience was with a couple of (very fit) female friends of mine, one of which went on to be a GF.
The tabs were called MBS I think (something like Mind, Body, Soul).  It was quite mild but very enjoyable. I think we split 2 x £3 tabs between us somehow. It was hilarious laughing at all the police cars in town like they were noddy cars. I did have a mild reaction to the lights in the nightclub that strobed passed me - it seemed like they kept setting me on fire, and despite me knowing it was a hallucination, it did disconcert me for a fraction of a second every time it happened. Then I laughed.
In fact I laughed so much, my mate was telling me all the shittiest jokes ever until the sunrise. I was belly-ache laughing at kid jokes. I actually got a bit anxious about that too. I had creases like "The Joker" on my face the next day.
Best £2 I ever spent.
My next and last experience was an absolute disaster - I got a "triple-dipped" strawberry from some punk associate in college for £3. I left it in the fridge for weeks then I came home alone one night in winter and thought the darn thing was losing potency so I better take it now (I was totally fucking pissed). What could go wrong? I've done LSD before and it was total fun.
Oh my word... Never take LSD when you are pissed. Somehow the total out and out pissedness of my brain that normally overules everything went into a little box somewhere - as the LSD took over. I lost all the feeling in my feet and kept having to turn the fire on and off to keep warm/cool down - but 30 minutes after my feet were burning and my Doc Martins were going on fire. When the cold hit, the fireplace looked like it and me were 13 billion years old. I would finally snap out and put the fire on to stop freezing to death but would soon enough find my Doc Martins melting again... Those billions of years were real time in my mind. 
Of course I had to go for a piss to release all the pints of ale I drank that night. The bathroom had a perfectly shaped solid version of light coming out of it. Problem was I could not feel my piss coming out or see it at other than 3 fps. So I would strain. Then I would be in agony as I overstrained, so I stopped myself - but the pain kept building up after I stopped. All my senses were out of synch.
I retire to bed. You don't know the hell on earth sleeping is when your senses have a fucking 20,000ms latency. You pull the duvet over - don't feel it. 20 seconds later as you try to sleep your duvet suddenly covers you. Pillows, tossing and turning. Fuck it was agony.
I could go on, but I remember thinking I should book myself into A&amp;E but I was too fucked to do that even and rode out the storm. 
That bad trip lasted 3 days in all. I was so happy my GF turned up on the second day, except when she pointed her finger at me telling me off and it felt like she was going to kill me.
WTF. All I can say is take it in a comfortable environment with good friends and no or little alcohol. Do not take it when you come home alone at night from the club in the winter and totally fucking pissed out your head.

There's merchant wankers too. In cockney rhyming slang a Merchant is an onanist. I quite like Oil Tanker as well.

How does face to face (cash) transactions work. I just spotted someone who likes to meet in a local library. Do I have to take my laptop with me with the Bitcoin client installed. (And a bundle of notes). Then what about the delay in the transaction getting to me.
It all sounds seedy and like going to see my dealer. Fuck, I am not using BTC on SilkRoad, honest guvnor! ;)

So why has DWOLLA been prosecuted by the Murkins, and it looks like OKPay is scared of BTC too?
I reckon Paypal spend 2% of everything they skim off on the scumbags in  congress to keep their absurd monopoly going.

Ok, thanks for all the responses, from what I can gather localbitcoins seems the best for me to buy.
In the meantime, for science, would anyone be willing to send me a test transaction of the minimum bitcoin amount (according to my wallet that would be 0.01 BTC which I work out to 70 pence, though I am sure smaller denominations are available I don't know if they will show up in my Bitcoin wallet. Let me know date and time of xfer. In fact give me a return address so I can see the stuff going back out.
I just want to see this stuff working live and examine blockchain.info too. I find this really interesting.

But do you have to sit there both nervously making small talk waiting for the transaction to go through? I mean I understand a BTC transaction can take 10 mins to hours!. Yeah, 10 mins for a can of coke transaction, fine. Just bail right away. 2 hours for a £10,000 transfer. Kind of crazy. What do you guys talk about other than BTC? Also, do you all take protection with you? (guns or security partners)

You know, I live in Liverpool so it's quite a journey, but that conference looks like an interesting meeting. £50 to pay fiat bankers for insane charges, or £50 on petrol. I would rather pay for the petrol. I spent my teenage years and later on 6 months IT contracting in London and kind of miss the place. Might be worth a visit!
ETA: Just joking, it's full of investment wankers. £499 invitation only?. Oh well, I guess we need these people to make a currency worthwile?

"SEPA transfer" - what is this? My bank does free BACS and Instant Pay transfers for sameday to 3 day transfers. Then there is CHAPS for sameday but costs around £20-£30. I have heard of international transfers using something called SWIFT.
I think I need to google, but it looks like the SEPA transfer charges are going to be around £50. Seems a bit steep to me.

So where do you get all your BTCs, are you a miner? If so what equipment do you use - I see there are USB sticks that can mine at a much faster rate than GPUs, though they are expensive.
@_date: 2013-06-22 22:36:07
Cost of transaction. Time of transaction. Simple. Money should be fluid.
@_date: 2013-06-23 22:45:22
You clearly don't understand how expensive our petrol (gasoline) is - and how congested our motorway networks are. Then London - OMG - as soon as you enter you are hit with congestion charges, climate change taxes, and a privatised army of immigrants paid to find the flimsiest parking misdemeanour and slap you with £100+ fines, plus 24/7 bus lane and crosshatch cameras to do the same. I am so glad I do not live in London any more. I just don't understand the people who do and suffer the oppression of being a car driver?

Just popped in to my local ASDA. I walked of course. Unleaded is £1.319 so it looks like it's coming down. I also have an ASDA credit card that is paid in full by direct debit which lowers the price by another 1% or 2%. Every little helps. Just a shame the Chancer steals £1 a litre minimum.
@_date: 2013-06-23 22:51:39
Pretty much all of it. It's currently £1.35 per litre. The 35p is the cost of the petrol and includes all the costs of drilling the oil, distribution, distillation, and the relatively meagre profits for the retailers. the £1.00 is the VAT and Duty paid to the Chancer of the Exchequer.
I would say a taxation rate of 285% is totally fucking taking the piss.
@_date: 2013-06-22 22:34:14
Interesting. So it is cheaper to meet up in a cafe or coffee shop than use an exchange? This reminds me of the original Lloyds of London meeting up in the coffee shops to do shipping insurance deals, and of course the Rothschilds doing the same with stock market trading back in the 18th/19th century. Have we all turned backwards?
@_date: 2013-06-22 22:05:56
I guess its a glass is half full/half empty thing.
I do know when I finally crack this thing I will celebrate with some blotters from SilkRoad. I haven't had acid since 1994 and quite like the ordering over the internet thing. ;) Stick it to "the establishment".
NSA/GCHQ - I am only joking, I wouldn't dream of doing such a terrorist activity. I am a 42 year old square. Honest.
@_date: 2013-06-22 21:37:52
Thank you for this. It looks like they charge around 4% over the Mt.Gox price, and for smaller exchanges seems reasonable providing bank transfer charges are not imposed.
@_date: 2013-06-27 15:28:35
I just realised Bitcoin can display down to 0.00 uBTC so even an amount next to nothing should do! Thanks

Heh, my 1200/75 days - I set up my modem and BBC Micro at home to answer the phone in 75/1200 mode and present a fake P R E S T E L diamond - then send the ENQ character (I think it was ASCII 0x05) - I set my local libraries prestel terminal to dial my home phone number and sure enough I logged the id/password needed. Free Prestel!
Sadly it was a bag of shite as it didn't include Micronet. Anyway, the fun was in the hacking.
The good old pre-internet days of PSS, JANET, accessed through DEC PDP/8 routers, and home brew BBS's.
