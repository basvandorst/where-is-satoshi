I'll always love a proper car / bike. But well be using them on private tracks not on the road in 20 years. 
What the car did to horses, so the (self driving) EV will do to cars. 
And I'm ok with that.

Drop today looks like that yes.

Who cares what's on the front page? Do you even look at it?

Ooh hark at Abramovich over here with his box!

What would be the incentive for doing this?

The OS is, but it's harder for a PC to fall out of your pocket.

Blockchain is a word like network or database. It's a concept not an object. So you can say "the Bitcoin Blockchain",  or "a Blockchain". 
In the abstract way used un the link, I suppose it should be "Blockchaining" or "Blockchains"?

How what should work? The English language? I'm sorry, but I don't think you have that kind of authority.

Increasing blocksize alone just seems like kicking the can down the road to me. 
Sure 8MB will help now, but in 10 years assuming mass adoption? Nah. Will need to keep going up indefinitely and that is a hack not a fix. 
I do see the issues with SegWit as well though. 
The cool thing is, we have both so now the market can decide. This feels entirely in line with the original vision to me.

It's the beginning of the end of capitalism, and the western hegemony, but no one in power wants to admit it publicly. Privately they all accept it.

Monopoly was designed to illustrate the flaws in Capitalism. It's not meant to be subtle at all.

I'm no economist but this doesn't make sense to me. There are limits to the space we have,  the natural resources available to us and therefore the amount of people that the world could realistically support. 
If real growth is the market expanding rather than just inflation, at some point it must end no? (putting aside colonization of other planets for now)

Douglas Adams was always right.

No-one cut your dick off dude. 
I think they may have chopped a bit of your brain out without telling you though.
