Being beneficial and being viable are 2 different things. Are you aware of how many transactions per second a blockchain network can do? It’s about 5. Will it change? No, because a miner has to broadcast a verified transactions to all the other nodes on the internet, which will take time. The more you try to speed this up, provide fiber networks to some miners, you end up being a bank. I wouldn’t have cared to learn the internals of blockchain if people weren’t betting on it like gold. Do you know how much bitcoins a miner is awarded for any transaction block that it validates? It’s about 10. We are talking here of about 50,000$ per validated block. That’s the incentive for mining in bitcoin.
I understand your faith in the tech, but for now it feels like a fyre festival.

Blockchains are completely probabilistic. Cibil attacks, eclipse attacks, selfish mining and double spending are always possible. The more decentralisation you want, the more trust you would have to put in the miners. The more you try to reduce the attacks, you restrict the network.
Although I completely understand the mechanics , I feel that people have invested in something that is more of a gateway for the systems that can replace banks.

For all the people being so confident about bitcoin, do you guys know the complete mechanics behind bitcoin/blockchain? Is you confidence supported by an opinion that's well researched, or is it plain faith?

I agree with the scope of tech. Decentralisation is super hard and current block chains aren’t the most evolved decentralised systems. I feel that a substantial architectural change with faster network for the world would pave the way to what we are looking for. I don’t know why it’s felt that bitcoin is the crypto that will rule the world. Why is it 5000$ per coin? I mean I wouldn’t but the tickets to a an amusement park that is still in construction and has already announced it can serve 5 people per second. Yes, more and better amusement  parks will spring up, but does my ticket to the previous park purchased at 5000$ mean I have access to all parks?
