Its not a solution, because the only solution has always been layers on top of Bitcoin. 
Remember that the core of Bitcoin has its power from the miners and in the nodes of the network. 
If we do something to decrease those numbers, then Bitcoin becomes less decentralized. 
By utilizing layers on top of the protocol, we keep a system that gives us perfect security in terms of data storage and audit. 
The blockstream team seem to be parading their own solution, but keep in mind that they do not directly make anything out of the sidechain project. It is equally open source as Bitcoin. 
It does however allow us to experiment with forks that are perfectly intertwined into Bitcoin's mining power, without spamming the network with pointless transactions. 
If we on the other hand just increase the blockchain size and keep saying that the problem with solve itself via Moore's law or whatever other theory will save us from overburdening our HDD's/cables/modems, we are taking a risk on centralizing our network even further by putting more stress on nodes.

The funny thing is that if anyone else but the core dev's were to propose a blocksize of 20MB, it would become an altcoin instantly. 
When it is Gavin, it is the right thing to do? All hail Gavin our leader? Decentralize what?

So the solution is to scale this up to 20MB and then what? What happens when that is too little? We re-scale again to 40MB? 100MB? 1GB? Will nodes download 1GB every 10 minute? 
Think about what you are saying. This is not a solution, this is kicking the problem in front of us!

But we can still script our transactions and pay whatever fee we want, right?

Mike and Gavin is pretty much destroying Bitcoin with this XT fork. 
What most people fail to realize, is that neither Gavin nor Hearn are gods in this context, and they are prone to mistakes like everyone else. 
- They refuse to discuss BIP100 by Jeff Garzik and move ahead without considering anyone's opinion. 
Despite the fact that we 3 days ago had Jeff Garzik's BIP100 proposal debated and to some extend agreed by Gavin, that has now died off again, and Gavin/Mike are once again pushing ahead with 20MB blocks. 
- They keep hiding behind the scaling problem and that the ONLY solution is the increase blocksize. Increasing the blocksize 20x is simply insanity. Why Gavin is proposing this is beyond me. 
- They leverage their "star" status in Bitcoin and thus non-technically capable people are accepting their word as truth and the only solution. Please keep in mind Bitcoin is not about leadership, but about consensus. Dont follow blindly, make a calculated choice. 
If these two individuals gain consensus for XT, Bitcoin will pretty much be owned by them, and any future change will not even need a debate as we have now. TWO people to control Bitcoin's future. Think about this one more time before you throw your vote.

I would go further and say that it is complete madness what Gavin and Mike are doing at the moment. Without exaggerating, this could pretty much be the death of Bitcoin. 
It is almost as if Gavin and Mike are paid by someone to ensure the takedown of Bitcoin and this approach is the easiest way to ensure the start of that. 
REJECT XT OR BITCOIN WILL DIE! This cannot be said loud enough.

Try  they are pretty good
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:21:10
Why? 
@_date: 2015-05-31 12:05:15
Probably one of the best ideas proposed! With a bit modification this will scale quite well.

Ok so why 16? What I dont get is why you increase the blocksize so exponentially much in one big go? 
To my understanding the node drop-off is due to increased blockchain size. If you increase that size by 16x in one go, without waiting for technology to catch up to the stress of the added storage requirement, even more will drop off faster. 
Why not start out with 2, then increase it X% automatically up to the 20MB you want. That way you give everyone a chance to settle with the ever increasing sizes and planning for such as time progresses. 
EDIT: Increase it X% deterministic and automatically, not via continuous forks, but as a build in mechanism.

Will this be open source? Or will it be something in between B2B and open source?

It would be great if Blockstream would actually communicate something about their project. Right now it seems like Lightning and other alternatives are making leaps that could lead to sidechains before Blockstream.

Why 20MB? The reason for all the drama is the unpredictable outcome of a 20x increase in blocksize. Why dont we just raise this to 2MB and see the "catastrophe" playing out less wild, right? 
If you want to break something, you overdo it, thus, do not overdo it.

Even if Bitcoin becomes mayor in the next few years, hard forking it again wont be difficult. Why you ask? Well unless we in the meantime teach grandma to sync the chain via bitcoin-qt I dont see a problem. 
The people running the core will be the people understanding what that means and understanding when and how to select between forks. Grandma will use her HSBC powered SPV wallet. 
Fork it to 20MB and you knock out even more nodes. Great way to make what was once decentralized, a very centralized project. Not only do we have a handful of mining polls, we will have a handful of  nodes as well. 
20MB is overkill!
