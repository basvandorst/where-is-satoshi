i can feel myself becoming dumber for having read that, please never post again

seems intelligent
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:09:23
also card skimmers will be a big deal depending on location.  currently doesnt support any kind of qr scanner so the only way to dispense bitcoin is via printed private keys which can be stolen on your way home, also the fees will be beyond insane.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:46:11
Not at all actually, this is a really really terrible implementation.  It works through using just cash to integrate with i believe coinbase and then send the bitcoin to the purchaser so that means you have coinbase fees for purchase then fees for withdrawal then miner fee just cash's fee whatever that is then the atm manufacturers fee and then finally the atm operators fee.  i say coinbase and not gdax because just cash only offers app to app integration so i assume they are using coinbase.  basically this is going to be a huge bust and anyone who learns even a slight bit about crypto wont use them.
edit for clarity: whereas btc atm operators are all third party and its a free market fees will be driven down and the customer will benefit in the long run, supporting businesses like this attempt to enter crypto may seem great for "adoption" in the short term but i personally would rather companies like this are left out in the cold.

yes they are backwards compatible, old wallets are now known as legacy
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:07:38
you guys are fucking cold
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:14:50
most of that is questions for a lawyer not random people on the internet.  Just put a QR code on the stand, or set up a POS system should be pretty easy.  Also dont try to hold people for confirmations, if someone rips you off for $5 probably just gonna have to take that one in stride and remember who did it.
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:38:41
thanks, makes it easier to explain to others if i can put it that way and still be "correct"
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:12:25
yea seriously, quite clearly not qualified

tell him that bitcoin wont be paying for his retirement home then since its a ponzi scheme
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:35:50
one of the first things that most learn about bitcoin is it is open source.  Do a LOT more reading.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:08:33
better hurry up and get back to english class kid

not even remotely legal
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:02:37
is it possible to buy bitcoin with something that has your name printed on it and it not be traced back to you?  hmm i wonder...
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:22:12
if you cant answer those questions yourself you are lying to not only us but yourself as you have done nowhere near sufficient research.

@_date: 2017-09-11 20:36:46
having a brain for starters man, age doesnt last forever but wisdom does.  Do your own research, nobody wants you to make money but you.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:10:36
better would be to put it on gdax/bitfinex/another exchange in fiat via ach transfer from your bank.  less fees for buying, every 2 weeks or end of the month you could buy in or when you see a nice dip.  gives you a little more flexibility with your money
edit: make sure the exchange is fdic insured also
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:53:49
that is in present tense as in any exchange who from this date forward deals in icos etc etc.  just my interpretation

im split, i cant decide if we will hit insane resistance at 4k or if we break 3800 resistance if we go straight back up to 4300-4500 range

if 1000 is your life your ass shouldnt be investing at all.  in this case it obviously isnt his life so i say go for it kid.

@_date: 2017-09-09 19:18:22
think of it as "pot odds" if youve ever played poker.  if i have to risk 1000 to make 100000 better believe i and most others will take said bet.  Bitcoin and crypto are a massive risk, but it also could be the means of exchange of choice in 20-30 years.
@_date: 2017-09-24 23:39:02
how badly did you fail out of math?
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:38:55
open source means auditable, means logically an intelligent person would come to the conclusion that either a.  audit it yourself.  or b since 08 someone somewhere has already audited it for you and answered said concern many years ago.
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:31:49
however it wont be fractional lending as it will auditable.

@_date: 2017-09-09 19:02:53
yes and no, op dont invest every cent you have true.  but youre 16 man, put in as much as you can i absolutely promise your 20 year old self will fucking adore you for it.  If bitcoin dies and you lose everything?  oh well youre fucking 16 and have the rest of your life to make back the what, $1000 total youre going to put into it?  thats nothing in the long run, but over the next five years invested in bitcoin?  could be life changing.
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:26:58
this is what we call an "aging out" problem, and is one of the major issues i hear when i talk to people about the future.  For some reason they (not saying you just using it as an example) just dont consider that "grandma" is probably never going to exist she will be dead so long before it would even be a problem.  Same as if you consider a nursing home now, in 50 years it will be MASSIVELY different depending on the generation at that age.  Crypto isnt going to replace fiat, at least not in our lifetimes that much is known.  But it will be the "interstellar" currency moving forward, its just going to take humanity to age into it.
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:30:23
i mean you can, itll just cost you 10-15% for the convenience.  i forget the site name it was like paybills or something
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:51:13
yea, no.  fuck all that shit, educate yourself and DYOR are absolute core tenants of crypto.  A sharp wake up call to that reality that not everyone is your friend is far more welcome to a newcomer than "be nice".

precisely, many of us are here to help.  HOWEVER, you can never tell who is a friend so ALWAYS do your own research and make your own decisions.  Reddit is a good place to get a baseline but nothing more and THERES A HUGE FUCK OFF SIDEBAR RIGHT THERE WITH THE ANSWERS TO ALL YOUR QUESTIONS YOUVE BEEN ON REDDIT THREE FUCKING YEARS HOW HAVENT YOU FIGURED THIS OUT OP?!?
@_date: 2017-09-09 06:23:33
not for years and years
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:49:28
yes, sell.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:14:33
not at 4am
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:17:03
yes that is what happens when you try to outsmart a great number of people VASTLY more intelligent than you.
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:47:49
zero, because selling right now would be an incredibly stupid idea.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:10:15
i have a trezor not a ledger unfortunately so i wouldnt know.  segwit is just a different way of sending/receiving, legacy wallets will still exist and are still the majority but segwit is fully compatible with legacy transactions

please remove yourself from the gene pool

no, wont be sooner might even be later in fact.  Lightning network is another 1 1/2 years off at least

if ever you have another idea, just let it go
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:59:28
what a shit article
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:20:12
not entirely wrong, for worthy projects its just kickstarter for coins.  to be honest i think icos do have their place, imagine a new startup wanting to launch something and having to pitch to investors, this way they pitch to people who are already interested in what theyre going to talk about.  might be a necessary evil until awareness grows.
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:09:53
leave it to the brit to be a useless cunt
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:11:02
start by doing your own research, or are you going to trust strangers on the internet to make investment decisions for you?  Cause you know what we call people that do that right?  dumb cunts.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:47:51
better hurry up and sell before you lose more
@_date: 2017-09-24 04:05:03

ok, and no you don't
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:05:39
no theyre great, just for my own portfolio ledger currently supports more coins than my trezor does so a little bit of buyers regret there.  im entirely satisfied with it though beyond that one issue
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:29:00
yes, of random strangers on the internet.  How is that not extremely foolish?  DYOR, I concur with you the hard fork and getting BCH etc is confusing however there are a ton of resources out there a simple google search away that can provide those answers.  Do the research, find sources that are trusted by the community at large (not individual members or groups) and read what they have to say.  it may not seem like a big difference from posting on reddit but it is massive.
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:18:24
youre a fucking idiot
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:26:51
that is not such a great approach, and it sounds like mostly a waste of time for both parties.  If they are not willing to fully understand what they are about to invest in it would be disingenuous for you to take their money and also likely be a ton of headaches for you.  Bitcoin crashes, you get blamed, they hear some crappy fud article you get blamed so on and so forth ad infinitum.
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:39:51

Hey Mark,
Saw this and wanted to drop by, Mt Gox was before my time so my knowledge is somewhat limited however I wanted to ask you a question.  I recently have found myself in a not so great business situation, recently launched company met with a disaster and now in debt to a few investors/friends who tried to bail us out.  Obviously nothing at all compared to the stress you must have experience, I wanted to ask how did you deal with it?  Any advice or tips for getting through a day when the world is falling down around you?
