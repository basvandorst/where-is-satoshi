It requires some amount of space to put a transaction on a block, so the people mining blocks charge a fee to put your transactions onto the block. If you don't pay a fee they have 0 incentive to register your transaction.

Yeah, by charging fees to people who are less responsible.

And most people want a system that "just works." Why would a normal person swap from the dollar to bitcoin if they lose insurance?

The first argument is the basis for Bitcoin existing, though. If you trust a corporation to make reasonable decisions the whole premise is moot.

What percent of people actually understand proof of work as a concept? What percent of people understand it as implemented by each node? How many people are actually capable of looking over and verifying the authenticity of the claims made by bitcoin devs?
Most people are still trusting someone else to be doing what they claim: proof of work does nothing for them.

Blockchains by definition are more wasteful than centralized databases. The work that a centralized system does is a factor of redundancy times transactions per second. Redundancy is some constant that is whatever the database owner is comfortable with.
The work a blockchain does scales as a factor of nodes times transactions per second. Increasing the node count makes the system stronger in the face of attack, but it leads to dramatic increases in the total amount of work done by the network as a whole because it's typically *much* higher than whatever redundancy a centralized system has.

The issue isn't the technical feasibility, it's how you compete with AWS. It works in the show because they have a magical encryption algorithm that lets them run the same service at a substantially lower cost. 
In the real world, if everyone uses the same general technology, Amazon is so far ahead in terms of economies of scale that it's hard to believe anyone could perform the same task at a lower cost.

Then the question becomes why do you trust them more than the banks?

The point of a savings account isn't to let it grow. It's to save it in case of emergencies it you need it quickly. A better comparison is putting money into the stock market.

People who think it's worth something. Just like any other crypto-currency.

Adding nodes doesn't improve transactions per second. That's one of the core premises of the system. 
At some point it'll be reasonable to use Bitcoin as a replacement for normal currencies, but we're obviously not there yet.

To be honest you might want to think some more about this. Bitcoin is great for some things, but storing a significant portion of your money in it is pretty risky. If you've only got a few hundred pounds you might be in for some really rough times if the value temporarily drops.

The dude currently has less than $20, he has more important things to worry about than his investment portfolio.

Likely because when you don't have much wealth you value security and ease of access than theoretical gains. 
A 19 year old looking for financial advise might literally be living paycheck to paycheck, and moving money in and out of crypto to pay bills is insane.
Of course if the kid was some trust fund baby who was just bragging about his or her inheritance that doesn't apply, but that's probably their reasoning.
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:30:05
Oh, that's a case where I'd argue bitcoin is definitely something to at least look into. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:41:51
Theoretically it's trustless, but an average user doesn't want to have to spend the time it takes to really understand the system. They aren't going to look through the source to verify anything. 
They're going to trust that the people implementing it are doing it correctly.  They're going to trust that whoever manages their wallet is going to do it honestly.

That still doesn't make it perfect. Ethereum has had numerous software issues that have led to millions of dollars stolen. When Bitcoin goes down the line of off-chain solutions to scaling there will likely be smaller and smaller communities for each one. 
We can pretend that vulnerabilities in widely used, open source crypto libraries don't exist, but that would be foolish.
A system that people are expected to store significant amounts of their worth in either have to be perfectly secure (impossible) or offer recourse when issues arise. Until Bitcoin can offer that it requires a significant amount of trust in the system.

No, you just need to trust the people who are implementing each layer. I'm not willing to look through tens of thousands of lines of code to verify it's correctness.
