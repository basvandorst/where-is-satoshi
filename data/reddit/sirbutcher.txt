So a currency which backed by the most advanced army, used by billions, exists for two hundred years is only 1000-10.000x stronger than the currency which only backed by a technology alone, existing only for 9 years and you are laughing at it. I think this just proves how far the bitcoin come.

Come up with a solution where every hash is calculated from a captcha string.

Because this mathematical shit is what the bitcoin is. A bitcoin is not a piece of paper but a very special text which represents a result of a mathematical equation. As there is no way to find this special text so you have to use brute force (this is what mining is) and try every number. So to create a new bitcoin you have to find a result for this equation. So it is impossible to create one bitcoin by skipping the mathematical part. This is why it couldn't be created by forgery.

But you need 2.660.000.000 to calculate 1.00 USD worth of bitcoin per month (assuming everyone just a little slower than the guy who wrote the article and they can do 0.5 hash/day). And this assumes you don't pay anything to them at all, and you don't have to buy the pen, paper or anything else.  
  
Basically, if everyone in China started to work for you they would generate about 0.5 USD / month. And by everyone I mean the child who just born and the 100-year-old man as well.

If everyone in China would start to do it you will still have to wait a LOOONG time to find a valid block. Basically, it would be more likely to be rich if you pay everyone to buy a lottery ticket in every country.

Obviously, this isn't about the "Bitcoin is more widely used than VISA!" which is very clear and a well know fact (edit: I mean it is well know that bitcoin is far less used than visa). One of the biggest attack against bitcoin that the network can't handle the amount of money what the visa's servers can handle - which, as the statistics show, isn't true.

Assuming a huge USD crash won't come forward, or another, yet-unseen bubble won't burst, etc. I still have my grandpa's one billion trillion pengo (it is a Hungarian money after the WW2 - yes, that number was on a single bill) - they had to pay taxes as well. Didn't helped much the currency still plummeted. Inflatable money can lose its face value if they make too much of it. Yes, it is likely that it will never lose ALL of its value - but saying that other forms of traditional (or new type) of currencies are not worth anything because right now you can pay your taxes in it is kind of pointless.

BTC core recommended fee for an 8-hour confirmation is 0.00001 BTC which is around 0.079 USD right now. For 20 minutes it is 0.000055 which is 0.44 USD

Basically, nothing has value. Your fiat money all depends on trust and hope that the people (especially in the leadership) don't do a smaller or bigger fuck up (which happened already multiple times). So you don't have any good reason to trust USD either. At least bitcoin has a pretty strong protection against other people's fuck ups.

Except for one thing: the bitcoin network can't really "go down". Yes, the connection at the point of sale could be severed - but that affecting a single entity. Even if a miner or a group of miners go offline then the rest still can work. The miner network is pretty much works globally - even if a whole country goes offline the rest of the network works just fine. Connection toward the bitcoin network literally contains thousands of possible paths. Any of them down doesn't affect the network as a whole.

Extra info: Szabo is a very often used Hungarian surname - Hungarian naming style is the same as the Japanese - Surname and then Firstname.

Segwit already greatly reduced this amount, and LN can increase the output of about a thousand times as large as the VISA have it right now. Fees increase if the transactions pile up. If the blockchain (thanks to the Lightning Network) can handle millions of transaction (VISA can do around 20k transaction) per second this is very unlikely that will ever happen again.

BTC is a low-level system as it is now. Like the banks was some decade ago. A transaction between two banks, even today, is SLOW. It takes hours, the EU created the law several years ago to reduce this to a maximum of four hours! Well, except if you start the transaction after 5 PM because then the transaction can take as long as 10 hours.  
  
Bitcoin is currently in this phase. Every transaction is like a wire transfer between banks: it takes time (btw, much less than between banks). When you pay with your card it happens instantly because there is multiple layers of this low-level foundation and VISA, Mastercard, etc companies created a trusted layer. The payment itself still take time: when you buy a cafe a shop will get your money in 1-3 days. An online bankcard payment again one more abstraction layer on this wire transfer technology, adding ANOTHER company between you and the merchant - when you buy something online your information and money goes through around 4-6 companies - for example at our service provider it takes about three days. When you buy a parking ticket we have to wait 3 DAYS to get your money!  
  
Bitcoin already has the new networks (and second layers) under development which will act like VISA and others: they will hide this waiting time between you and the shopkeeper.

To say the truth it is kind of hard to believe that a Bitcoin exchange with a physical shop can make enough money to pay the rent alone, not only pay wages for the staff. I would rather think that this shop is just a front panel for a money laundering business.

No, we are saying to hold and only sell if you have no other chance or you will get back enough that no matter what else happens you are happy.  
  
For me if I could get out a million usd from it I wouldn't care if later I could get a billion - a million usd would set me for the rest of my life, more money wouldn't make me happier. Yeah, I could find a way to spend it, but I wouldn't be heartbroken at all. Getting 1k USD when two years later I could get 1 million would make me super angry at myself. Obviously, this rule gets overwritten if you must sell because of that or going to the street, but this is a different story.  
  
And off course don't just hold it, use some to actually buy stuff as we wish to have it as a useable money and if everyone just collects it then it doesn't really fulfil this role :) This year everyone getting their Christmas present bought from bitcoin :D (And refilling what I sent later).

I totally remember being "unplugged" and around bored human beings, no thank you. It was awful. I spent most of my summers bored out of my mind reading the same 50 books over and over again, without chance to learn unaccessible topics (without the internet I would never become a software developer - we didn't have money for the super expensive books), nor had friends from all around the world, nor have instant connection to my parents 1700km away.

Then next time open a text file and vomit your opinion there. It would be better for everyone. You would get it out from your system and we don't have to see it. It would be a win-win situation.

(If you register to coinbase, register to GDAX too, transfer the BTC to your GDAX account (free and instant) and transfer the BTC from your GDAX account to your hardware valet - this way the transfer will be totally free while transferring from coinbase cost several dollars.)

There was two very bad news/review against bitcoin and it didn't fall that much. it is very likely that it will increase again, and in the future, there will be drops again, yeah. The same happened in the past and it will happen in the future, too.

If you have money to do it (and you are willing to lose it). I do small investments but I simply can't risk much - I transfer part of the monthly extra to it, but that's all. If I would live alone or with my parents than I wouldn't care but I have a family behind my back.  
  
To win big you need to have bigger funds to start with.

Why should Core accept and give support for a hard-fork which they don't want to support nor the nodes support it?  
  
It is like you want to attack Linux for not accepting every available Windows and Apple driver and simply refusing to work with them (because Linux just should throw away half of their correct foundation and rewrite years of work why is it so hard, amirite?)  
  
If S2X want to follow this way, then have fun, but why they want to exploit other resources? I am not an important person I know, but I ran a full node on my dedicated server and I do not support S2X, and I do not wish to give my resources for a hard-fork which I do not support. S2X nodes hiding because they do want to exploit resources and the Core developers did the right choice to try to stop this.

Don't forget that NK didn't even allow mass communication into the country. They are the one and only country in the world where they don't build their industry on the current technology-level communication. (And they are a horrible hell-hole).  
  
Any other country (USA, Europe, China) whole industry is built on the current communication. If you want to stop Bitcoin, you have to stop the whole internet, basically. Shutting down the internet basically would immediately crash the given countries economy.

Yeah, the Hungarian Pengo hold this title thanks for the WW2. After they switched to Forint. (And to a Russian occupation)  
  
My granddad often told me that he got payment in a huge suitcase - and its lost half of its value by the time he arrived home. At the worst point the above money barely worth anything at all. Who could afford it (and not a lot of people) switched back to gold or old-style "I have a shoe and a lamp can I get a bread" style of trade.

Debit cards, however, aren't loans at all, just a way to accept your money what you already deposited - same true for the Netbanking (initiating wire transfer) - and prePaid cards are means that you already PAID for them (this is why they are PREpaid cards)
