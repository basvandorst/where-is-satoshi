Cant you just pay for it online? no need to withdraw cash if you are able to spend you money electronically.
As far as I understood the news, they only put a max to withdrawals, because they will run out of notes and people in greece are withdrawing them out of fear that the government will seize them in their accounts.

I like the current market, I get more bang for my bucks each dip.
@_date: 2018-05-18 20:25:52
Yeah, and I bought some at the time, thinking it would go lower.
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:07:17
True, Im waiting for it to hopefully hit 6000 .
Im buying in with 500$ a month regardless of price.
But if it hits 6000, Im Going all in.

Well i shared the statement video on my facebook just to annoy apple fanboys on my friend list
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:12:36
Thats not my point, I was merely implying that by keeping large quantities of bitcoins locked away in closed markets, while still making money off them, this could make incentive for others to do the same and cause a large demand for bitcoins in these markets.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:02:39
Why would you trade you BTC for cash?
@_date: 2014-04-13 16:41:00
Do I understand this correctly, they speculate in bitcoins in a closed market? 
Meaning they have a wallet with a certain amount of bitcoins, and then they let people buy shares of that?
@_date: 2014-04-20 08:29:22
Im using Vircurex and so far Im very happy with them, but they dont offer cashout as off yet, so Im actually looking for other services that can do the that without the Verification.
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:00:37
So this will have some sort of impact on the BTC market in terms of rising demand by more and more funds like this?
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:54:31
I just switched to p2p mining and i happy with it.
havent had a single share accepted for 4 days but still.

The reason its lower in Danmark,  is because we have Dankort, a debitcard with no fees when shopping with it. This card is for everybody above the age of 18.

I dont know why you are being downvoted for that comment, Its clearly satirical. upvote from me.
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:02:14
but also , they do not sell these Bitcoins out to the open market, they just have their own little fee party and drain the open market of bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:48:34
wow thx

Everyday I predict the price going up by all margins and to be safe I predict the price going down by all margins.
Now tell me I cant predict the future even though I also did it yesterday.
@_date: 2019-10-13 17:47:32
Perhaps, but that is not normal, it was this way yesterday to.

@_date: 2019-10-13 18:23:21
Well Ive been in this for quite some time.
Maybe not 11 years but around 6.
So the volume used to go up a bit over the years, drop a bit now and then but none the less a steady rise.
Not a 75% decline over two days length.
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:02:50
By the replys you give.
You seem to grasp what the things are but you have deemed mesh supirior.
LN is the scalability we should work for.
Mesh is just a sort of VPN anonymity tool, it wont hasten the adoption. 
Im not saying LN is the great solution, its just the best answer so far, as is bitcoin, who knows if bitcoin is around in 10 years.
go to github and read up on the stuff, even suggest something there if you feel like it.
@_date: 2019-10-14 11:40:56
Im watching a lot of exchanges, so not naive.
Not new nor dumb.
But my view of the matter has been demed dumb and or naive.
The thing is, I dont think anyone wants to be a part of a community, where everything is being looked down upon if I cant show 10 btc in my possesion or better.
@_date: 2019-10-13 17:36:34
Yeah thats a given, but why the massive drop?
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:48:13
My answer to this downwards trend is not as simple as I would like it to be.
I have seen this before and am reluctant to calling it.
A 75% decline in volume is not normal. 
The buy/sell wall is also not as large as it should be.
Meaning that some of the big players are either holding or selling of the markets.
Whatever the answer, mine could be just as wrong as anything else, I doubt 2020 will come around under 18 k bitcoins.
Quick edit: if bitcoin goes to zero, then it was a fun ride.
@_date: 2019-10-13 17:24:39
As an edit of such.
Please keep the price lower, Im not at my goal just yet.
@_date: 2019-10-06 20:38:25
I keeo seeing this being posted. Why so many posts?
Bitcoin trading volume is somewhat normal at the sites I follow.
What are you trying to tell us?

@_date: 2019-10-14 12:49:44
Sorry, I dident mean to be a dick.
Its just that a lot of peps here downplaying me and calling  me new or naive.
Ive just checked my first interaction with bitcoin, and that is a little more than 7 years ago. I joined reddit because of bitcoin 6 years 8 months ago.
This was the most helpfull and informative community back then other than github.
Its not like that anymore, the better than me attitude is gonna scare people away.

@_date: 2019-10-13 20:10:20
Well I have more than this one, this is just my go to.
Its fairly stable with a somewhat high volume day to day.
I do look at hitbtc and coinbase too.
But mostly I focus on this one.

the nigerian scam mails was badly worded and grammatically a mess, this is to weed out the smart ones, only stupid folks reply to said stupid mail and therefor is easier to manipulate.

Ive been investing small amounts since 2013 it all accumulates so before long I have a full bitcoin again.

In Denmark we have mobile pay and something called Swip.
Its instant money transfer with your phone, very usefull and I use it quite alot.
Even though I have been in the bitcoin community for a couple of years, it hasent quite gotten a hold in the Danish community yet.

@_date: 2015-02-05 16:38:01
I know, its just a minor thing with how i skim text to find things quickly, so when they treat version numbers like this I find myself stumbling over the words and have to read the whole thing from scratch to figure out what to choose.
TL:DR Im lazy.
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:27:47
Is that an error or do the version actually go from 0.9 to 0.10.
My first guess would be from 0.09 to 0.1 or from 0.9 to 1.0
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:41:05
Im not saying its not valid, I, just asking cause in my case Im not that familiar with the program, and if I needed to download the newest version I would just look at version numbers.
Not saying there is something wrong with the way software is numbered, just saying it can get quite confusing.

Today they announced new 1,5% 30 year bond loans in Denmark.
And I just refinanced my 3,5% to a 2%.
I really dont see the economic crash anywhere?
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:50:03
Im really not at the top of the bubble, I just have been luckywith the loans, they are 2% no matter what happends. So unless I die, I dont see any bad things about that.
