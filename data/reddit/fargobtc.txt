Libertyx.com works well
@_date: 2016-08-23 13:26:52
Good point. Be sure to check the reviews.
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:12:24
So why compare them?
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:21:04
Yeah, wait for your haircut.

So like the circle feature that has been out for years, and no one uses? I don't get why you'd want a messenger in a payment app, as if anyone would switch from texting/whatsapp.

Lol, no.

Windows is not safe. Stick to mobile.

Most likely flagged for structuring as the accounts probably have the same IP. I'm sure they'll clear it up for you.

How much?
@_date: 2016-04-04 18:32:44
 
:( really wanted to buy a OB sticker too.
@_date: 2016-04-03 06:42:39
Did you check if the coin was actually sent by searching your mycelium address on a block explorer like  ?
It could be that the transaction is "pending" on circle's end. They are a regulated company so sometimes manually review new accounts transactions.
@_date: 2016-04-20 19:11:18
What if no one ever posted they were having problems with iGot. Think of all the additional victims.
@_date: 2016-04-15 14:13:35
I think they're showing how you can destroy the device if you ever need to? They tweeted after this saying it cannot be put back together after.
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:00:33
40 aud over current market price?  -_-
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:08:02
Weird, your post didn't mention mpesa's new messenger app. I like the idea of sending money, just don't find a messenger useful.

blockchain.info was the cause last time.
@_date: 2016-04-22 02:37:31
Wow.. your right.. they edited every word "bitcoin" out. There was 6 when I ctrl + F'ed the first time.

Worked, thanks.

@_date: 2015-06-03 22:21:19
Is there a way to see all addresses in your wallet? The address auto changes after you receive bitcoin... that's a little weird. If someone send to one of my old addresses will it still show up?

You can buy as low as $50 with libertyx. Easiest option.

looks like the site barely does volume, and is ugly.

Is this a well known site? Looks a little low budget.

I love coinbase. Luckily I have not had a horror story like most people. But I have had a question I have been trying to ask for about a week now, and can't seem to catch live support online. I'm sure a multi million dollar company can afford some chat reps?
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:07:31
How does this companies spam always make it to the front page?
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:15:06
Either way 0.0083648 will always equal 0.0083648, no matter what some site is estimating it's conversion rate at. 0.0083648 right now is right around $2, so I'm assuming breadwattes exchange rate might have been a little screwy at the time.
@_date: 2015-06-25 12:20:14
I can help, PM me for more info. Do you have a domain/host already?

LibertyX.com if they have a store near you.

So 6 million a week? Geez, I'd like to see how that compares to sites like coinbase and circle.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:48:38
Oh, I thought they were advertising their own service once a week and using multiple account to upvote it, since the posts usually go commentless. I must be confused. Props to such an innovative product. MUCH different than just using LBC.

I don't get how people could complain about this. I for one think it's awesome to see the other side of the argument for once. Too many times we only see bashing with no response from the company. Coinbase is a huge company now with tons of investors it has to protect, expect them to do their due diligence on users. I have had an account for over 2 years, with orders as big as 7k, and never had as much as a delay with a deposit.

@_date: 2015-05-27 01:04:37
Your forum shows videos of the stream before paying? no
I do like your idea of discussion though. Streamium.directory is using wordpress so it would be easy to turn on comments (note to author)
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:55:00
Why do you just have the whole site inside of a iframe from a different domain. It should only take a few minutes to add an additional domain to your server.
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:36:45
Yeah who doesn't want to go through the hassle of obtaining a MSB to make a dollar per transaction.
Abra is essentially local bitcoin but for cash right? Seems pretty sketchy.

@_date: 2015-05-21 16:24:28
If you're considering bitquick, just use localbitcoin, there's no need to go to a bank and show them your ID, but you still pay whatever seller's premium. 
LibertyX on the other hand has no fees. And you don't have to upload a picture of your receipt each time.
@_date: 2015-05-22 13:33:58
Should try Libertyx.com if you have a location nearby it's super easy.

bitcoinstorestarter.com plugin doesn't make you signup for any 3rd parties, you just type your wallet address you want the coin to go to. I don't see a difference between this and bitpay/coinbase's woo commerce plugin.

You mean when bitquick got hacked but didn't actually lose any bitcoin, but was clearly lying since they had to shut down after.
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:06:28
What's so special about it?
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:47:02
You think the white paper is a spec sheet? 
The code is open source, meaning that its available for everybody to look at, scrutinize, and even modify. Anybody can change it, but this isn't an issue, as nobody will accept your changes if they're not beneficial to the community. Bitcoin is a fully democratic system. Bitcoin users themselves decide to accept or reject any changes made to the system, and naturally, they will not accept changes that are not in their best interests. There is a core team of developers who work on bitcoin, and if their changes are liked by the majority of the bitcoin users, then those changes will become adopted. 
That is how we got to where we are today. Not following a "spec sheet". I agree that the initial vision for bitcoin must be maintained, but to not improve on code and ideas since satoshi is no longer here 8 years later is insane. Should we just leave bitcoin where it is?
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:37:00

I know the feeling.
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:26:25


Probably the most important point here imo.
An important thing to remember is that the investors will be responsible for capital gain taxes. If that isn't motivation for a government entity... well idk what is.
@_date: 2016-03-23 17:54:42
Whether it is sustainable is irrelevant to the fact that the volume is extremely inflated because of it. I believe they have been fee free for years now.

Kraken is a pretty well respected company. I'm sure there can be some AML/KYC complications, or even fraud flags triggered with a brand new account wiring thousands of dollars right away. I'd give them a few more days to sort it out. Although, bitcoin companies tend to respond quicker when you post a rant on reddit.

It won't be used as a payment system, but will aid in bitcoin becoming a better one. The bigger bitcoin becomes, the less volatility involved. Right now, a large company could not move 20 million in, or out without causing massive waves in the market. I think this will help with that.

Oh okay, gotcha now. So you are saying the bank would file a SAR on you in (not for you, as you stated)this scenario, and you would know about it. This also speaks to your ignorance as it would violate 'tipping off' laws.


employees, and agents who, pursuant to any statutory or regulatory authority or on a voluntary
basis, report suspicious transactions to the government, may not notify any person involved in
the transaction that the transaction has been reported. Provided that no person involved in the
suspicious activity is notified, 31 CFR Chapter X clarifies that the following activity does not
constitute a prohibited disclosure: 
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:08:24
Wow! Big news.
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:56:38
I would have to agree. For bitcoinist, and bitcoin.com articles anyways.

What about my post history implies i'm lying? Every post in the r/btc subreddit is pro core. I literally posted proof of the tx. Regardless of if you think I'm lying about what the tx went for, you cannot deny it happened. This sub is quick to label anyone not posting a rollercoaster meme a troll.

First off, that is not "in detail". The response was geared toward someone with no technical background.
48 hrs to move from your cold to hot is pretty extreme though right? I have cold storage for my personal coin, takes about 3 minutes to sign a transaction with it, then broadcast. 
Although, knowing them, their cold storage is in some bank vault somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:45:47
I believe in core, and segwit. But this totally sucks. I used to always brag to him how bitcoin was way better than using a credit card. Bitcoin as a currency is 100% unusable as is.

You joking?
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:37:43
That's another problem... it did not. I wish breadwallet let me choose a slower fee. Might need to switch.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:17:33


A SAR is not related to $10k in volume. You're thinking of CTR. A SAR should be filed on all suspicious transactions over $2k. (As someone in the AML field, I have a feeling the guy you're responding to is talking out of his ass.)
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:58:26
If I had to guess, banking played a role. I know most big name Bitcoin companies in the US have had extreme trouble keeping banks. Even coinbase, with banks as investors has had to hop around.
The current Circle business model is probably 10x less "high risk" from .a banks perspective.
@_date: 2017-08-27 02:55:00
Impractical** then. - unless you're sending 100k to the Philippines, but nobody does that.

So debit card only? Interesting.

"because there is an infinite number of coins" .... seriously....?
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:24:37
Don't forget to file a SAR with FinCEN as the purpose of the transaction is to pay a ransom. Think most OTC provides would avoid this transaction for that reason alone. 
Then don't forget to beg your bank to keep your account open when they call you and ask why you just received a wire for 250k, and your response is "twas just helping someone pay a ransom with that darknet e-moneyz, bit coins".

Should be pretty easy for you to find a source that a "sar" is required for all transactions over 10k right?
Don't worry, i'll wait.
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:58:44
Where does it say you must SAR a person/transaction because it is over 10k on that page?  I was merely pointing out that the number 10k does not directly result in the need to file a SAR as the commenter implied.
I get how you can be confused as CFR guidelines state:


I assume you are confusing the word "report" there with a suspicious activity report.
One thing worth noting is you are quoting CFR guidelines. I hope that is not where you get your information, as the guidelines for MSBs are different in a few areas. The CFR guidelines state a suspicious activity of $5k + transactions should be reported. The FinCEN website also says that, but then includes specific guidance for MSBs:


transaction that requires reporting under the terms of 31 CFR Chapter X if the transaction is
conducted or attempted by, at, or through the financial institution and involves or aggregates at
least $5,000 ($2,000 for money services businesses, except as provided in Section 6 of this
document) and the financial institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that the
transaction or pattern of transactions of which the transaction is a part:

@_date: 2017-08-27 05:17:44
Yeah, this might be the last straw for me using breadwallet. They can put out BCH support in a week, but can't develop variable fees after years of customers requesting it. I would have happily waited an hour for the TX to confirm. Although, I still think $2.41 is insane for "a few blocks" which is is 0-12 blocks at the current time. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:01:27

Look at the fees for the first 10 transactions in the last block. All over that amount:

Lol last month? Happens twice a week
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:18:22
Actually the next 100 are around the same. I'm in favor of small blocks. Just pointing out that fact. As someone who when he sends btc needs it in the next block for business reasons, my fees are usually always around that.

How does one determine “no selective advantage” with 0 research into the underlying tech. The whole podcast seems like such BS, claiming none of the altcoin markets move due to the tech behind the coin.

@_date: 2015-08-12 15:38:15
Factom seems to have a lot of stuff they are working on. Good work guys!
@_date: 2015-07-22 20:37:39
What is magnr?
@_date: 2019-04-17 13:53:56
Anyone else have this issue? I really want to recommend it, but once typing a bitcoin amount the only way to close the number pad is to click the Recipient icon on the top left.
I've tried swiping down on the number pad or clicking anything else, the only thing that works is that icon -- even that took me minutes to figure out.
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:24:59
Sweet, I'll give it a listen. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:31:59
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:13:58
Yeah I love the new UI. Just figured someone would have run into this issue as well and was curious if it's just me.
@_date: 2017-04-23 23:16:55
Will update, thanks guys.
@_date: 2015-07-28 00:28:51
Factom is interesting.
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:08:06
Can someone explain the significance? 
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:21:37
I like that this convo is taking place, even though I do not know where I reside in my stance yet.
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:32:45
Do they have a iphone wallet that is user-friendly? or a mobile wallet at all?

Thank you!

Nice work.

One of the reasons coin.mx got shut down:

Not relevant to his point, but I agree.

Are there any libertyx.com locations there? 
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:27:32
Awesome work guys!
@_date: 2015-07-03 16:29:36
Cool idea. Not sure if I would ever use it though.
@_date: 2015-07-26 01:56:16

@_date: 2017-04-04 17:01:25
[LibertyX]( has always been great for me. If your in the US.
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:23:38




@_date: 2017-04-06 13:47:24
True, but "creating" is a little bit of a leap.

You are not, you are not.
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:51:52
This is a [ location right? The one near me has the same sticker.
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:31:15
I should download telegram and make an account, and search for the telegram group for the project or make a github account next time. Got it.
@_date: 2016-02-25 23:59:25
I can't imagine you get many USD orders either.
@_date: 2017-04-23 22:14:56
You think I should scrap the node count you mean? I had mixed feelings about including it.
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:51:49
Why don't the miners want it?   /s
@_date: 2017-04-23 20:07:37
Appreciate it!
@_date: 2016-09-02 17:16:19
Where did you find a number for them? I remember searching in the past and there is no number on their website.
Edit: just found it " Give us a ring at +1.800.398.7172 . Or send us a note."
@_date: 2016-09-19 01:06:55
It's happened to me before. Did not refund me the fee. Although you might have better luck with that since you made a reddit post.
@_date: 2016-09-20 13:52:08
Nice try Garza.
@_date: 2016-09-02 16:33:58
[LibertyX]( works good. With fees, you end up paying like 1% over coinbase so I only use them if I need the coin quickly and can't wait 4 days.
@_date: 2016-09-22 13:46:55
How does this compare with the "size" on blockchain.info's homepage? Every time I look they are all close to 1mb: 
@_date: 2016-09-23 03:47:05
@_date: 2016-09-17 02:21:25
Well... it's free for them to accept bitcoin. Not sure why they need bitpay.
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:15:24
Because it's not common for people to post issues or bugs with wallets on this subreddit? It's a discussion forum, you think it's a bad idea to engage in discussion on it?
Anyways, I love the new UI, and have ditched breadwallet due to its shitcoin overload. Just figured someone would have run into this issue as well and was curious if it's just me.

Sounds sketchy. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 14:21:12
Really? Didn't know they charge that much.
@_date: 2016-09-08 13:06:49
From what I've seen, this is true for early users, since it uses SMF's default encryption method.
@_date: 2016-09-17 16:30:00
Yeah.. took 5 business days to get usd into coinbase last week. I know that's prob not their fault, but circle is usually a lot easier.

@_date: 2016-09-15 18:35:44
FWIW I used them first in 2014. Not many bitcoin startups in the US are 2+ years old.

How long you been working there?
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:45:41
But core has segwit support built in already. Just not as easily as some would hope for. We'll see after the next update i guess.
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:20:49
Cool idea, theres a lot of fraud around ACHs now a days though. I think if you had really small one's it'd be less risky. If the batches were $1000+ you would get hammered.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:58:14
Oh okay, everything's fine then.
@_date: 2016-09-02 16:42:18
I think it depends on the store too though. I've seen some charge a little more, and some a little less.
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:21:37
A transaction between different coins without a middleman.

But that's why I come to the comments.
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:47:53
This, or any cash option really, like a ATM. But [LibertyX]( has been around for years and definitely supports under 18 purchases.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:11:09
Thanks Bash
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:31:41
Pointless. What about segwit?
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:53:03
You can do it manually with core though. I read it took about an hour of development work for one company to implement. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:52:09
Maybe can chime in? You guys seemed to implement it insanely fast (thank you btw)

Weird how wishy washy the no altcoin policy is here on . I just had a post deleted because it was about a company that did a ICO as well.
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:35:19
To figure out how to build your own bitcoin transactions in a piece of pre made software? Really? Don't think it's possible to do in an hour? Can any of the companies that have done it chime in?

it's an airdrop. Someone will find it.

Their wallet has improved a lot. Their explorer does sometimes lag 2 blocks behind the rest of the network which can be annoying but I see that happen like once a month now.

I don’t think dorian appreciates people using his face.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:21:03
Because they charge the fees to their customers 
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:35:25
Yeah all the reviews are 1 star and say it doesn't work so I figured it wasn't maintained.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:57:18
Well internal transactions are not on chain, so obv they wouldn’t make you pay a fee.
BUT, Coinbase does not pay network fees, i just tested. Even the email they send after, states it. Not sure about gdax, but i doubt they would pay it on gdax and not coinbase?
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:31:39
It's a good idea to test your seed at least once to make sure it works.
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:11:06

@_date: 2015-04-28 22:39:55
How does bitquick fit in? Seems like they just wanted to toot their own horn by posting this. You can buy bitcoin anywhere and use it on amazon with purse. 
For me, I would prefer a site that I can buy bitcoin without a bank, like LibertyX or LBC

Wow, so roger can just hop on the blockchain server and see who owns whatever address? Alarming. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 01:11:47
I just don't get it. When i think of unbanked I think of a kid in africa that the closest bank is 90 miles away.
What is the excuse for being "unbanked", when your going to a bank daily and showing them your identification/filling out paperwork anyway? I have free checking, and most banks offer the same so I would not say fees? I truly don't get the service. Then you have to take a picture of your receipt if I'm not mistaken? Fuck that, I can do a coinbase buy in 5 seconds.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:14:37
You just told a guy on the internet "get a grip" because he posted a shirt you don't like.
You sir, are a turd.

Giving your ID to a bank to buy bitcoin...... kind of seems like everything bitcoin is trying to stop.

Not often bruce makes sense. But here’s an upvote.
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:54:12
You still have to go to a bank to use the service right? At that point you might as well just make a bank account while your there, signup for coinbase and save the trip.
(unless i misunderstood the service and you do not need to visit a bank to buy the bitcoin then i apologize.)
@_date: 2016-10-23 06:03:46
Depends on the lender. I had a much different experience.
@_date: 2015-04-29 01:30:55
Connections? All you need is a bank account? Which is free, and your going to be at a bank anyways to use bitquick. My question is just why not do that? I truly don't get it.
I get the anonymity argument. But at the same time, I seen a user post that you have to show your ID to the bank.
@_date: 2016-10-31 20:52:17
Not sure if you can with mycelium. You can try. It will definitely work in electrum though. Either way first step is to get your private key from core using dumpprivkey as described here:

Good point. Just didn't think people in debt were buying tons of bitcoin

This is actually really nice. UI could use some work, but great start.
@_date: 2015-09-16 17:27:15
Is it weird to call yourself the "leading bitcoin platform"? Coinkite is a wallet right? I don't think any other wallets make their total of transactions public.. But I bet there are a few with a lot more than a quarter of a billion.
@_date: 2015-09-16 17:28:02
Would it not be weird to compare a bitcoin buying service to a wallet anyways?
@_date: 2016-10-17 19:04:41
When did low fees become something we are so willing to easily sacrifice. When I used to do my bitcoin pitch to friends, that would be one of top 2-3 things I'd mention. But I agree, segwit is a good step.

Does it run a full node? I would get it just for that?

Bitcoin forked because of a bug in the code. Not because a bunch of people lost money due to a company they invested in.

@_date: 2017-05-25 04:15:56
It was a flaw in something other than bitcoin's code, so we didn't reverse all of bitcoin. Which in my opinion is how a coin with a ledger claiming to be immutable should act.

The twin brothers are hoping the Securities and Exchange Commission approves their new fund, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, after a process that has already gone on for more than three years. In its latest filing, a seventh amendment to its original filing, the brothers said State Street, based in Boston, would serve as transfer agent, while San Francisco-based Burr Pilger Mayer will act as auditor.
The transfer agent acts as a fund’s administrator, responsible for recording ownership changes, calculating the daily net asset value, and maintaining records.
Burr Pilger Mayer, meanwhile, will conduct monthly “proof of control” exercises, essentially an audit to show that all the bitcoin reported as being held by the fund are legitimate. The exercise will be carried out by Gemini, the Winklevoss’s exchange and trust company that will act as the ETF’s custodian, and results will be verified by Burr Pilger Mayer. Related Coverage


A Bitcoin Fund Is Born, With Teething Pains (July 6, 2015)
With a Bitcoin ETF, Risk Isn’t Virtual (Sept. 7, 2014)


The price of bitcoin in its earlier days was wildly erratic, and indeed is still volatile. However, since a spike in late 2013 and crash in early 2014, it has been more stable. This year, it has generally been rising, and is up about 48%, trading recently at $635.
An SEC-approved ETF could attract more mainstream investors to the asset, but that isn’t a sure thing and it is unclear how the SEC will rule. There has been a fairly competitive race to get a bitcoin ETF out to the investing public, and it is seen as a key conduit for the digital currency to gain exposure to more mainstream investors.
There is already a bitcoin ETF on the market, the Bitcoin Investment Trust from Barry Silbert’s Grayscale Investments. It trades over the counter and hasn't been approved by the SEC. In addition, another offering from a firm called SolidX is awaiting SEC approval.

It's a shame, they denied it for weeks
The leaked emails are pretty alarming too:

Good point, I think adoption/transactions per day would be a better metric. Obviously coins with a huge premine, or initial ICO will have a irrelevant market cap.

You can not hold customers funds and still have to abide by kyc/aml laws. Check cashers for example, dealers in precious metals, someone buys a car from you with over 10k cash, etc. Although, I don't think it applies here with these small payments for service.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:12:35
Yes, this will ruin BitGo's flawless reputation.  /s

Coinbase if you have a bank and don't mind waiting a few days. LibertyX.com if you have a location nearby and want your coin instantly.

I just seen on the hastalk forum the brainwashed users are praising josh and saying its all made up so people can destroy this threat to bitcoin. It makes me sick. How can you be so foolish.

He was trying to get them off.. no need to be a jerk.
@_date: 2016-05-19 03:22:29
Hmm, I don't know if I trust them. They say they lost no user's funds, yet try to sell the company after? I can't imagine they would shut down the site for months if the hackers got nothing.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:16:01
We have a store at my local mall in the US, and there's a US website. Unfortunately only the UK site has the bitcoin option when I just tested at checkout. Was just curious.

Super sweet!
@_date: 2016-05-15 14:09:35
Cool site idea. I'd recommend going back and adding more detail on most of these. For example, there's a ton of details on relevant bitcointalk threads.

Your private key should be stored on the phone itself and not in any cloud.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:12:58
yeah.. not to mention there's already like 4-5 of these cards out there.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:59:27
Yeah but, it's on the checkout page of uk site. I tested.
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:37:56
Agreed, BUT that is how they have handled all downtime since 2011.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:09:37
That's correct.
You can find your seed if you slide out the menu on the left -&gt; settings -&gt; show recovery phrase.
It's a good idea to test the phrase before storing large amounts by deleting the wallet, reinstalling then typing the phrase in to recover the wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:28:58

Don't think that's right? Typically if you don't complete a send your money isn't taken from your balance. It is a site bug. But yes, give it another day or two.
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:40:57
Depends on how secure you want to get. A good mobile wallet like Green wallet is good enough for small amounts.

Also [LibertyX.com]( has low KYC for $200 purchases and under. Anything more I think you need an ID.

@_date: 2016-07-18 13:46:52
So what does the app do now that it doesn't offer the spare change feature? I tried checking the site, but I can't find a answer... Can you just buy bitcoin using your coinbase account? I don't see the point.

About once a week my electrum switches to watching only and i have to restore. Sucks.
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:00:17
Did it work once and switched to watch only?
Just click File -&gt; New / Restore -&gt; restore the wallet.
My electrum switches back to watch only like once a week for some reason as well.
If it has always been watch only, it's possible you used a master public key?
@_date: 2016-07-18 13:51:54

4.5% fee i believe plus about a 5% exchange rate markup from the receipts i’ve seen.
Personally i’ll just stick to coinatmradar.com or libertyx.com to save a few %.
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:59:20


more like 0.0001% if I'm being honest

Is that not the same for any traded commodity?

No, neither has majority of big exchanges excluding bitstamp. This guys an idiot. Sucks that it takes a reddit thread to solve support issues now a days.
