I just bought 100btc through coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:58:53
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:16:26
So youre going to sell $20k worth of btc for $18k
@_date: 2013-04-07 11:54:00
Did you mine a crap ton?
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:49:34
LOL this ride is crazy. It's almost back to $90 already.
@_date: 2013-03-28 18:24:24

@_date: 2013-02-15 03:36:26

@_date: 2013-03-31 05:44:37
Most recently I purchased reddit gold.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:27:09
Its going back up to $70
@_date: 2013-04-07 11:49:27
HOLY SHIT ITS GOING CRAZY
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:22:58
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:56:48
I dont know how to work the js util :( so I was manually spamming the button. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:08:32
I feel bad for people that sold.
@_date: 2013-03-27 06:22:24
No more money to buy more :(
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:52:16
Any guides for a computer illiterate person to set this up?
@_date: 2013-03-23 07:37:38
Whats wrong with that?
@_date: 2013-03-28 09:14:56
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:57:13
Sorry there was a bug earlier but it got fixed. Please let me know your address so I can send the btc back to you. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 08:03:16
thanks :D
@_date: 2013-03-24 07:20:21
I felt the same way after buying at $30, $40, and $50 but look where we are at now
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:47:02
It is not. There are many other sites like this. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:39:19
Its back up to $200. If you want to sell it in large quantities I suggest you sell it locally to people or check bitcointalk forums to see if anyone wants to buy large quantities.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:37:51
I was spooked, so I sold it. I have a lot more confidence in bitcoin now.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:52:22
Thank you! We are open to any suggestions you might have.
@_date: 2013-03-22 08:41:20
I just received my transaction back into my coinbase account
@_date: 2013-04-07 11:48:36
Man that must suck.
@_date: 2013-04-23 06:58:45
You need to email them to straighten this out. They gave me the same email but solved it after I emailed them.
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:04:04
Sorry for the hiccup. i need to test this out. real quick. I will refund you btc. which address would you like it sent back to?
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:22:01
10k buy wall at $92
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:41:06
There are huge buys currently. I am buying now.
@_date: 2013-04-16 09:45:43
GOOD LUCK FRIEND
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:07:26
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:38:03
I don't think so. What the governments did in Cyprus was they put fear in the banking system. I don't think the citizens are going to easily deposit more money in their banks from now on.
@_date: 2013-04-24 23:54:11
I pretty much got scared shitless when I received those emails. I thought someone hacked my account and was selling the bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:32:07
Here we go!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:39:00
coinbase.com if youre lucky
@_date: 2013-03-27 08:57:47
Keep trying. I was manually spamming buy and it worked. It takes constant spamming though.
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:25:25
If that buy wall stays, we will probably see $100 pretty soon
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:43:36
Where do you buy the raffle?
@_date: 2013-04-26 07:40:51
Email them.
@_date: 2013-03-21 02:53:59
I think dwolla to mtgox is the best way if you have your bank account attatched to dwolla. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 08:51:25
Same here. Still waiting
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:43:56
i was spamming my buy button. it works if you want it bad enough.
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:23:27
12k buy wall LOL
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:59:11
I bought more 
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:36:28
That's a $1.4 million dollar wall right there
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:51:06
I had this thread queued up!
@_date: 2013-03-27 05:52:46
I heard on the news that this beggar makes enough to support a family of 4.
@_date: 2013-03-20 00:31:54
wallet name
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:16:50
Is it called a bubble when it re inflates that fast.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:45:18
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:03:16
Its also super exciting.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:33:20
its lag
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:30:08
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:27:12
15k buy wall
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:11:17
I got a reply an hour ago from coinbase:
Sorry about that! We were doing performance improvements that caused some temporary delays (posted in the status updates section here:  and we are still working to regenerate some transactions that went unverified. You can expect a resolution in the next 24 hours if not sooner should your transaction still show "pending" or your balance not refreshing. Again, sorry for any undue stress caused!
Regards, 
Fred 
@_date: 2013-02-19 20:12:44
I just fixed the 0 balance issue by sending a bitcoin to my coinbase account and the balance appeared after that.
@_date: 2013-02-19 21:06:09
I fixed my 0 balance issue by sending my coinbase wallet 0.01 bitcoins and it went back to my original balance + 0.01 btc. It seems like its a display issue.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:28:49
Friend just tried to verify and he was in queue as over 11k
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:21:52
They give you the price of the btc when you sell it at the time. The time it takes for the USD to get to your bank is about 4-5 days though.
@_date: 2013-05-25 04:50:56
Just purchased with bitcoin. Can't wait to try the juices!
@_date: 2013-04-30 05:51:36
Ya I use their site all the time.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:50:26
It's exciting and dangerous.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:18:33
He should introduce them to them.
@_date: 2013-03-23 07:41:47
Y no faith?
@_date: 2013-03-23 07:34:25
CHEAP COINS PEOPLE!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:29:59
My mind is blown
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:43:59
$10,000 for 10 days ?
@_date: 2013-04-07 09:43:28
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:31:58
The minimum transaction is .01BTC so if it was lower than that then I don't think it goes through.
@_date: 2013-06-10 04:03:04
I miss these roller coaster rides.
@_date: 2013-03-15 06:39:34
How do I create the passcode? I check the enable passcode lock and then  try to change the passcode but there is no enter button? I have 4.2.2 JellyBean 
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:39:54
There is a huge buy wall of 4.5k bitcoins at $179
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:07:18
DDOS attack it seems.
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:35:49
No Idea. Probably password cracker.
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:02:59
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:12:05
Sorry Guys I have sent back your bets and reset the system. It should be working fine now.
@_date: 2013-03-24 05:21:38
Coinbase is easy to use if it actually works. Currently there is a lot of demand and its also still in beta so there are hiccups.
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:35:43
Sorry currently fixing it right now. There was a bug.
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:19:18
same here
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:49:12
Wow someone or ones sold 2k btc that second
@_date: 2013-04-27 22:03:37
Coinbase takes a long time to transfer sometimes. It took over 24 hours for a transaction to go through one time for me.
@_date: 2013-02-17 09:26:11
@_date: 2013-04-27 21:04:16
This is probably a good thing since governments are recognizing Bitcoin as actual currency.
@_date: 2013-06-18 23:21:58
@_date: 2013-03-25 06:24:43
They are currently under heavy load 
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:43:29
Very high demand. I kept trying and I finally got to buy some but it takes time.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:41:13
Looks good!
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:51:42
I kick myself every week for not buying the week before.
@_date: 2013-03-21 09:22:24
When i sold over 100 btc during that fork.
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:28:16
I am getting: Unable to generate a ZipZap account number for you. Please try again or contact Support. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:36:44
There are many like this. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:46:04
Just wait until the lag clears
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:38:21
Thank you
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:29:57
Android only
@_date: 2013-03-24 00:23:04
Thanks for the update
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:24:14
they put in a huge buy order. Must have a lot of money in gox.
@_date: 2013-03-30 06:45:10
They are now crying :(
