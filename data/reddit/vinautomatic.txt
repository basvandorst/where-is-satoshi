It's definitely about the vanity generating website - check comment links below.

The reasoning of my post was to comment to knock some sense into the commenters of that article because I don't have time to battle flamers all day. Was trying to utilize the power of redditers to knock some sense into these morons. 
Don't get why this was downvoted. Really don't.

I concur, it happened to me today, but I think it was all address from Vanitygen that got hacked. !(_

Yes - I got this as well. That makes sense about anything worth the tx fee.

That is sort of correct. It is decentralized, meaning, every miner is their own pool itself when they join. When you see the "unknown" on  - that's p2pool(s)

true that...

I've been on there trying to help as many people as I can for a few months! Right now I'm helping up a blind person using a screen reader configure his miners!!! Feels great to help.

Can't wait for this event. My good friends are in the biz/economics department and masters program at FAU too, I'll be coming down from Boca. 
So many people interested but the personal networking down here is still loose. That changes now.

 is where I generated my vanitygen address - BEWARE of this site..
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:42:00
Or take an address from it which gives you a key, which they are saving for later. New wallets created -_-

Nice site they designed/developed there. love the "no bullshit" clause on the guarantee. Damn I missed out I would have offered a better deal (I resell site5 off the planet).
