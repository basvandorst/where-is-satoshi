Wow, this is great! 
Thanks for your ideas, I was thinking along the same lines with comparing it to gold/silver but I also like major currencies (and as a unit of the global value/reserve currency). 
Definitely a lot to work off of what you wrote, thanks for taking the time to come up with the ideas.

Yes, we try to not speculate so we find it's best to analyze what's happened to help our subscribers make informed decisions.

What I mean by price analysis is we do our best to try to explain the price movement of the previous day.

Great suggestion, we do our best to not speculate but I do think we could do a better job incorporating more coverage of alt coins.

I agree they are awesome sites, would you add anything to them or do you think they have it pretty much covered?
