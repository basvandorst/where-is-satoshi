Soo...two billion, carefully trickled out? Not as good as Bill, Walton, or Warren, but still good enough for your own african country, population included...
But 'Satoshi' is an early adopter of a (relatively) low throughput, high yield asset of his own invention.  My key idea is that a hypothetical timetraveler has a limited number of high-yield investments given 20/20 hindsight.  Apple stock.  Amazon. Facebook. Bitcoin.  Google.  Tesla.  Registering [sex.com]( ancestry.com, shop.com.  BC is unique in that it follows the custom of stock highs and lows, comes with massive fluctuations to exploit automated buys that temporarily ignore market wash, all with anonymity and the lack of 8949's.  Back of the envelope gives me a 20,000% return, but I figure no better place to get the solid numbers than fantasy land itself...

See, you're assuming that future peaks exist that exceed the $2,200 peak or so from a couple years ago.  Downside is that major banks have invested heavily into mining hardware, leaving the layman priced out of competition; not to mention competing currencies that lack or add some of these disadvantages to their benefit.

Your uncle Larry.  Larry might blow up a lawnmower with M80's and gasoline 3 times a year, but he hasn't failed yet when it comes to investing in cleverly obfuscated ponzi schemes (pounding sand in the hopes that future investors will send you money via seniority based on your pounding ratio)!
