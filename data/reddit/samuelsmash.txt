Ok bro, you didn't even read the entire thing in detail. Now you're assuming that he tripled his mining equipment and just forgot to mention it. 
Also the images he shows that are ''his'' machines are S9s, also forgot about it. He later just changed to story to I know the owner when pressured about it so nvm.

Hell no, I'm from Maracaibo and we would consume 1500 kWh a month easily (having 3 12000 BTU AC running all day) and never paid anything significant. 
I'm trying really hard to find the price of the kwh in 2014. 
This peruvian article says that it was half a cent of USD: 
However were they using the many of official exchange rates or the black market exchange rate? 
Back in 2014 the official exchange rate was 6.3 BsF per USD, then 144 BsF simadi (another official exchange rate) and finally 70 BsF at the black market (11 times as much as the first official exchange rate). So either it is 0.005 USD per kwh 11 times less (0.00045 USD per kwh). 
A Spondoolies Sp20 draws 1.2 kW, 5 of them is 6 kW. Each day thats 144 kWh and a month is 4320 kWh. 
So at the official exchange rate is 21 USD or 1.9 USD at the black market exchange rate of electricity a month, of course in reality all calculations are done at the black market exchange rate. And well Im surprised that he actually would manage to consume over 1 USD a month, still way less than the 7 USD claimed.
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:59:45
And when did he say that he expanded to 15 of them?

Venezuelan here, I haven't read OP story in detail yet, I did noticed that he said that he paid something like 7 USD for electricity back then (which is too much, electricity has always been super cheap, like usually less than 1 usd a month). 


There are countless internet providers, the most common ones are cell phone providers, because getting internet by cable is almost impossible as the cables are stolen. I use Digitel and Movistar, they charge a little less than 1 USD for 1 GB of data. Speed is usually under 1 MB/s.


It does, thru DHL. I have used them. 
Although recently the US has forbidden flights from US to Venezuela, now idea if it is possible now. The amazon packages go thru Panama first, so maybe it is still possible. 
Either way, shipping directly from Amazon to Venezuela isn't that good idea, people mostly use Freight forwarders like LibertyExpress and Tealca, they will receive several packages and pack them all together and send them as one which reduces shipping cost a lot. Something that you can't do with Amazon most of the time as not all packages ship to Venezuela. They also offer the option to ship via ship which is super cheap, I imported 3 100W solar panels (for obvious reasons) for 50 USD.


How can you tell this btw?
Edit: Alright I have read it in detail. 
I'm not buying it. Way too dramatic for some mining equipment. Plus the 7 USD a month is too much.
Edit2: He also said that he was making 4k usd a month. Which is too much even for a doctor at that time.

0.35$ isn't a small fee for most venezuelans, the average venezuelan lives with less than 5$ a month! It would take a little over 2 days of full time work to cover the 0.35$ fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:54:45


That is completely false btw, nobody here is using bitcoin to buy things. 
Actually most people don't even know what bitcoin is. 
The very few that do, use it as a method to get USD. Venezuela is literary in a self imposed embargo, you can't trade BsF for any other currency at all, so one way to jump over the barrier is using bitcoin, the other is going to colombia for pesos.

Thanks for explaining me that's not fear, neither engineering.
Have a nice day (you really need one).

As Venezuelan, I really liked this comment, thank you.

Well depends on who you ask. Since maduro is in power the country is more divided than ever. 
I mean if you're a venezuelan who lives with minimum wage, well things aren't going well for you at all. Most people. Actually even if you live with twice the minimum wage you will still struggle to make it to the end of the month. 
On the other hand, if you're a venezuelan who receives income in foreign currencies, well things are going great for you, unless that income is less than 20$ a month. 


The very few that do, use it as a method to get USD, most of that people are merchants and miners, and most likely hold their btc on localbtc wallet instead of a safer one due to transfer fees. I personally had 0.007 BTC on nicehash wallet and lost it all since I was waiting for the transfer fee to be 2% of that money :( 
(And the last sentence makes sense with either sea or es, but es sounds better). 


Well recently someone on r/vzla complained about localbtc's fees, and several told him yo use BCH: 


You're fine, just small details: 
Te agradeceria* (use te instead of me, just for being a bit more more cordial) and pudieras instead of puedas, and hacer isn't needed in that phrase.

bitcoin took years to fill 1mb blocks. Why is people so afraid to even increase it to 2 mb? 
The cost per gigabyte of HDDs has dropped from over 0.1$ to 0.03$, and we are still stuck with 1 mb blocks.

My city (Maracaibo) used to be full of pigeons, they've recently disappeared, we usually joke that people are eating them, but the more I think about it, the more I think it's not just a joke. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:48:42


I do. I need it to survive (venezuelan) and the high fees don't help at all.  
I have to hold my bitcoins on an exchange so I can use other cryptos instead for transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:21:58


No they don't, maybe chavez, but maduro does not at all. 
Read this: 
Actually they have made several social programs even worse, for example with housing assistance they used to GIVE YOU a house, now with chavez and maduro they don't. that's right, THEY ALLOW YOU to live there, but the house is not yours. This is done to make sure you always vote for them.
Also they don't want to give you their oil wealth at all, were this remotely true there wouldn't be currency controls like there are here. 
More recently one of their ANC members was expelled because he criticized the fact that the ANC wasn't doing anything to solve the economy of the country, apparently the problems of this country are because of the US, so fuck off.  (Even though the ANC was promoted to fix economy problems). 
Maduro himself lowered taxes for high value transactions, any transaction over 2 million BsF pays 3% less taxes and any over 5 Million pays 5% less taxes, essentially the rich pay less taxes here! 
Also the supreme court (which is 100% partialized with members of maduros party) recently removed a law that limited the wage of high ranking officials. Mmmmmm. 
There's a long lesson for you.

Because that isn't happening with bitcoin right? 


Asic resistance is meant to deter asic development, not be Asic proof. And most would be scared of developing anything after a few PoW changes.
Also the incoming change of PoW just revealed a big issue with asic development, now that monero is changing its PoW a bunch of ASICs are for sale now: 
They didn't want to sell them before because they wanted the profit for themselves, now that those things are going to the trash they're selling them (we didn't even know of their existence)... Who knows what bitmain might actually be using right now. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:04:40


Nonesense the point of ASIC resistance is to make the coin minable by the average joe using average hardware. There's no need at all to have an ASIC. 


This is a free market, companies competing with others to sell **money machines** at a cheaper price than the other is completely delusional, they'll keep most of them for themselves and start price fixing their older hardware.


So why is Monero changing its PoW? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:48:41


That's july's salary, this month it increased to 136544 BsF. 
And both figures are ignoring the ''Cestaticket'' which is a food bonus currently worth 189000 BsF, both together make the minimum wage 325544 BsF.
Now the exchange rate is a mess: 
Notice how fast the BsF is devaluing, back then I mentioned 25000 BsF, now it is 28000 BsF. 
You can check it here: 
Also dicom now wont give you usd, just yuans and rupees. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:25:48


Is that a problem? 


Right now RAM companies are colluding and price fixing their chips, and those aren't **money machines**.
In what world would anybody compete to sell their money machines at a cheaper price than others? The best you can hope is them competing to sell (get rid of*) their obsolete money machines. In the end there will need to be external intervention, it will be either us or a government, And I would really prefer the first one.  
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:58:12


They did because those networks wont change their PoW. 
Bitcoin should do what Monero is doing, changing the PoW every now and then in order to deter Asic development.
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:29:19
I know of several people who live with *less* than the current minimum wage. Which is 12$ a month. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:18:02


Image if the US passes a law that sets the exchange rate to a fixed price of 1$ for 1 BTC, what do you think would happen? Everybody will just buy every BTC and exchange them somewhere else where it's got higher value. 
That is what's been happening to the venezuelan bolivar for more than 10 years now. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:34:19
It's not, most directly use the USD. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:43:01
Terrible, they're using something close to the dicom exchange rate, they give you 10.000 BsF for 0.00013 BTC (0.82 usd right now) when the actual exchange rate that everybody has access to (black market) gives you about 32000 BsF for 0.82 usd right now...
It's pretty easy to get BsF in exchange for other currencies, however getting other currencies with BsF at that exchange rate is impossible. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:47:37
Actually some places will weight the bills here instead of counting them. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:32:51
The minimun wage recently increase from 250000 BsF to 325000 BsF, however back when it was 250000 the exchange rate was 10000 BsF per USD, now it is 28000 BsF. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 08:08:52


Mmmmm: 
Venezuela has had free education, free health care, housing assistance, subsidized goods, almost free electricity water, gas and electricity decades before Chavez. 
And here you are, claiming that they did nothing in capital letters. 
Back in the year 2000 when chavez started, the minimum wage of a venezuelan was equivalent of 500 USD without any currency control, and now well, less than 30$ using the legal dicom exchange rate (it's actually about 4 times less using something everybody has access to).


Are you sure about that? recently they asked what everybody does for a living:
I don't anything close to a high class job. 


Let's see recently the minimum wage went from 150.000 to 300.000 BsF, while the usd went from 10.000 BsF to 42.000 BsF. mmmm something doesn't seem right. 
 
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:37:32
Since BTC has dropped in value, the currency has devaluated extremely wrt USD. 
In december it was 100K BsF per USD, now it is 600K BsF per USD.
