@_date: 2019-02-18 04:34:22
Was wondering if up or down,  now I know could be either thanks r/
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:04:02
What's wrong with bch? I understand the marketing practices are deceptive as all hell, but what's so terrible about the coin itself? It's still usable, so im not sure I'm ready to call it a scam til I know more.
@_date: 2019-02-16 07:38:20
Lol I hope that's is everyone's first thought
@_date: 2019-04-02 20:07:42
Yeah, I was there. Didn't know but April fools last year
@_date: 2019-04-15 20:00:56
Ya know what, this comment made me feel alright. I wasn't truly satisfied with what I've built and where I was headed looking back
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:19:12
It's as if I was already too late lol. Gon hodl like the fool I am.  Had it for years. Too attached
@_date: 2019-04-15 20:05:21
If you only knew about my alt infatuation lol
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:47:05
Could this really explain the boost? It would make sense that it all started from an April fools joke

I bet the farm at 10k, then promptly lost my job. I need this man
@_date: 2019-04-15 03:52:25
I know I know! Life was going great and my earnings were morethani everexpected when I invested.  I took it all for granite while I was living in the moment.
@_date: 2019-04-15 03:53:14
Yeah down
@_date: 2019-04-25 21:29:50
So... should I dump my bat now? It's the only one I have that is up for me.
@_date: 2019-04-15 20:01:49
Haha read the comment I was replying to
@_date: 2019-04-15 03:56:48
I have no plan,  but if she goes 20k I pray to God I have the strength to cash out. Been "retired" for too long
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:20:01
Hey bud. How's ur diet been? Getting enough fiber?
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:26:22
And then the drug abuse starts. Ahh feeling alive is all that's left to live for!  Time and security aren't real. We are all a firefly spark from death
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:15:03
Ya. Imagine that. Bet it feels like losing a decade of working towards your highest priority goal. You'd probably constantly dwell on where you'd be if you invested the energy elsewhere. Feel foolish because everyone else was right and I have nothing to say or do but start from the bottom again
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:27:27
Yep and I bought him 2 shots for every shot he bought me tonight.  I don't even like that fucken asshole

@_date: 2019-01-20 07:34:47

@_date: 2019-01-21 07:15:50

@_date: 2019-05-13 19:34:13
Good advice for every office on every personal topic. Sharing recipes is crossing the line if you ask me
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:13:10
Yup. That's called a proposition. It's a word that precedes a noun and relates to another clause
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:31:28
Reddit missed my beautiful setup into a confused definitions thread. Shits harder than starting the wave at a brewers game.
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:05:09
Not about feelings. It's about post visibility and how it relates to stealth marketing practices. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 09:31:23
I'm sick of your doubt.  There's a plan, but first we need. more. MUNEH!
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:11:48
God dammit don't you know when you invest, the price drops!? You've domed us all!
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:54:14
I'm just bitter bc I let the sewing circle get the best of me and left a great job bc of it
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:32:54
You are correct, dino. Anyone seeing this needs to be aware the accounts downvoting and attacking critical comments are controlled by the corporations that create the initial posts. Don't let anyone make you feel foolish for independent thought. 
Especially in dead threads on low effort posts!
