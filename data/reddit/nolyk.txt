Well you're a joy to be around aren't ya. lol
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:06:06
Oooo dang. Sorry to hear about that! A painful lesson to learn that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:27:46
Glad I could contribute. Haha
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:54:55
Haha I know........I know 
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:24:13
Haha true, true. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:26:20
Right on! You're doing it right. Haha. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:33:03
lol Awe shucks. But seriously, thanks. It was a sucky experience, but also sucky to share and be open about it. You guys have all been really supportive and encouraging though and it actually makes me feel better. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:02:36
This is great advice...thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:24:50
Haha well what the heck...you passed me over. ;) Nah, keep on doing that. I wish someone would have forced me to take more precautions...
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:16:17
Luckily I didn't. I'm new to crypto but not new to taking financial risks. I never put in personal cash that I can't afford to lose. Thanks for bringing that up...as I feel that anyone investing in crypto should have that mentality. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:50:47
Unfortunately, I did at the time. Again, this is my fault. Newbie mistakes all around. Have updated security and passwords all across the board now. You always think "that will never happen to me..."
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:04:33
Debated back and forth for awhile. But figured my story could only help people to not make the same mistakes. So far that seems to be the case. :) I was looking for the positive in all this. I guess this is it. :) 
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:42:02
Haha thanks. I'll take some sympathy. ;) I hope people do!
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:49:26
You are exactly right, and that's the best mindset to have. I've already re-invested. Smarter, and sharper now. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:31:47
Haha yeah...not this time unfortunately. "unsuccessful dropout"
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:05:41
Haha crazy. That's good advice. ����
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:29:57
Thanks. I do too every time I think about it. I'm almost over it thought. Just money. Still, nothing worse than logging into your account expecting to see a nice stack and instead seeing $100 and a withdrawal completed from and IP address in South America. lol
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:14:05
Haha true, I guess. I just should have been more careful - it could have been avoided is all I'm saying. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:04:45
Thank you. Sincerely, I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:12:07
Lmao I might have to look into that. Haha but nah, there are many failures that accompany any successful endeavor. I'm always happy to share the ups AND downs with my audience...and now this Reddit community (had no idea I would get a response like this!). 
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:33:16
Also bittrex.cam
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:40:40
Yeah, if you listen to the podcast I tell the whole story...but basically I wasn't paying attention and landed on a phishing site. They were in and out in 15 minutes or so. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:30:30
Glad I could contribute. The positive in all of this is other people learning from my mistake!
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:53:16
Haha hey thanks! Watch me turn this $1 into a million. ����
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:27:13
Thanks for the encouragement. Yeah, debated on whether or not to share originally. Decided it was best. I was looking for a positive in this situation and I guess this is it - other people learning from my mistakes! 
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:03:07
Dang straight lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:01:02
successfuldropout.com? Not a phishing site. Just a podcast I have. Just ignore the drop down opt-ins. :)
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:13:42
You're very welcome. Glad something positive could come from this by people just learning from my mistake. :)
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:25:37
Probably a good idea...although I think it is offline now. But hey, check out  lol
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:57:31
Yes! Lol Dance Gavin Dance all day long. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:06:55
Well take it from me. The inconvenience of 2fa is worth the extra protection. :)
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:25:10
Yeah they took it down as of this morning I noticed. But check out bittrex.cam
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:34:57
I probably listen to their old stuff more often. But Chucky vs the Giant Tortoise is my all time favorite song. Haha
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:56:22
Haven't heard of it...but sure!
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:30:56
Great advice!
