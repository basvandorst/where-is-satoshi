When did you woke?
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:55:24
Seems to be mentally unstable.

When the people storm his residence with pitchforks, I hope they remember not to destroy the precious art work that they have been hoarding. These will need to brought back into the public realm.
@_date: 2016-08-01 21:59:12
Do they pay you by the troll post?
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:29:24
He is a spiteful child it would seem. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:26:49
Dats a lot of unknown variables. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:25:02
So inside job?
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:46:15
The idea only came up about a year ago. I prefer they perform extensive testing; can't rush perfection.
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:57:13
Its like you have never even heard of segregated witness.
Moving the blocksize up an MB or two is a very temporary solution.
@_date: 2016-08-22 12:53:25
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:58:27
No he just wanted big blocks - why I just pointed out above is a very temporary solution.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:31:05
It doesn't solve anything. Bigger blocks will be spammed just like right now and we will back at square one, asking for even bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:05:52
Muh cryptokitties.
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:31:18
So is gold (also contains protons and neutrons).
@_date: 2016-06-08 07:24:27
not if crypto can pick up the slack simultaneously
@_date: 2016-06-08 05:20:19
These trolls aren't even trying anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:19:13
You're right. There is no such thing as shilling on reddit.
@_date: 2016-06-08 06:04:55
This is a smokescreen; the Fed is all about usury.
@_date: 2016-06-12 07:49:45
The 1st was really good. The second two were meh.
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:29:52
The FUD is not working as effectively anymore. Evidence of anti-fragility?

Why can't you be like the Winklevoss twins and STFU while letting experts do their job.
@_date: 2017-01-11 15:30:15
Sorry, the real reason is that the honey badger hired prostitutes to piss on fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-01-08 03:58:37
IS this guy part of the same Fed Reserve Schiff family?
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:36:48
Not before a capitulating dump to mid 800s. Last shake out before moon launch.
@_date: 2016-06-13 14:30:45
Well the moon is 237,000 miles away. So, let's say $237,000.
@_date: 2016-11-11 16:13:48
Or you know maybe have some actual ideas instead of putting a criminal up for candidacy and calling everybody else a racist, sexist, xenophobe.
@_date: 2016-12-03 02:37:29

Look at the Winklevoss twins; they just keep their mouth shut and get down to business.
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:25:55
No need - it's a ridiculous post. 
@_date: 2016-11-12 00:22:41
I stand corrected.
@_date: 2016-12-03 02:36:47
I can't stop laughing about that. It worked didn't it.
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:54:51
Price not unaffected; When Hearn quit, there was a significant drop.
Evidence of anti-fragility?
@_date: 2016-12-06 00:45:16
Thanks for being on troll watch.
@_date: 2016-11-29 19:40:56
Exactly the kind of nonsensical and outdated smearing tactics that cost Hillary the election. You are playing a mass manipulation game that doesn't work so well anymore. But carry on. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 04:57:00
Keep eating that shit the media feeds you.
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:42:04
Media is owned by people who have all the gold.
@_date: 2016-11-11 20:39:24
They just demonetized the 500 and 1000 rupee note - while introducing a 2000 rupee note, primarily to fight corruption (i.e. corrupt politicians storing ill gotten gains at home). The 2000 rupee notes can be detected via satellite and thus any large stashes of notes could be investigated for potentials indications of black money.
Everybody needs to chill.
@_date: 2016-12-05 17:45:46

Any guesses on when segwit is released? I'm happy for the testing process to take it's due course; I'm just excited is all.

This is a sexed up version of the same goofy powerpoint that Gavin put out about 18 months ago.

I'm voting Trump for the same reason I vote for Bitcoin:
Fuck the Federal Reserve.
@_date: 2016-10-13 18:22:00
It makes total sense.
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:55:46
- the Federal Reserve sub.
@_date: 2016-10-11 21:40:46
I like the cut of his jib.
@_date: 2016-05-28 20:13:57
Iz nonsense
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:52:22
For argument's sake, let's say it is the Chinese govt behind Bitmain and other chinese miners who can afford to waste billions in their ASIC (and free electricity) investment in order to force a chain split and 'fire' the core developers, with the long term goal of devaluing bitcoin. Is that a risk?
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:39:01
I don't think there is anything you can do about it. They are playing according to the rules. The good news is that I think redditors are starting to be able to critically think through the FUD imo.
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:33:12
2mb is a temporary solution - will you admit that? And one that introduces risks.
instead, Segwit enables LN which can potentially introduce millions of txs per sec and has been undergoing testing for 6 months.
It's that simple. But now I'll sit back and watch yourself shill about how we should increase to 2mB.
@_date: 2016-07-21 13:56:57
This should be a sticky on top of the Reddit front page.
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:37:26
I don't think there is anything you can do about it. They are playing according to the rules. The good news is that more redditors are learning to critically think through the FUD imo.
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:14:35
I check price at least once every 30 minutes.

What does the CEO of Reddit have to do with the CEO of Coinbase? Hmmm..
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:52:40
These guys thrive on manipulating information. Do you see the MSM? I just don't believe information integrity will ever exist - we just have to teach critical thinking from grade school onwards idk.
@_date: 2016-07-29 15:49:05
They both hate Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-29 23:16:08
No - it doesn't at all.

It will take a couple of weeks/months to do anything - just like the last halving. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:25:30
Toxic; radioactive; negative; clearly with the intent to divide and social engineer the community. If the Federal Reserve ran an anti-bitcoin sub, they couldn't have done a better job.
@_date: 2016-07-29 15:19:32
Yeah that really narrows it down. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:02:38
Found the concern troll.
