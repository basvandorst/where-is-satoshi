Isn't the Receive part the same thing Coinbase has done for a year or so now? Almost since I first heard about them they've offered a way to auto-sell any bitcoin sent to address X and at the end of the day deposit it to your bank account.

Pub 10 miles away. Bought 2 beers. They took my credit card in the beginning of the night to run a tab. Returned it without charging anything when I paid. They didn't have any tablet software, just a printed QR of their address. Asked me to leave my name and phone number in case the transaction didn't work. So, they don't totally "get it" yet.

Seems like one could have software create 50 lender accounts and 50 borrower accounts and have them transact with each other and leave positive feedback until they are all well trusted, then flip a switch and have your borrowers obtain larger amounts of BTC from other lenders and ride off into the sunset without paying them back.

I am Libertarian. I don't believe that is necessary or sufficient to use bitcoin. Some might use it as a political statement, some because it's edgy, some because it just makes sense financially, some because they prefer privacy - none of my business. Don't worry, my raving lunacy is not contagious. I will never try to force you to use bitcoin or become a Libertarian.

Anyone can set up a standalone wallet on his computer with no paperwork at all (i.e. not connected with any exchange). To get coins into it, the most likely answer is you send them, and they compensate by sending you gift card or whatever. (I'm not a lawyer, I don't know whether this makes you a "money transmitter" or not. If you listen to anything I say, that's your problem, not mine :-))  There's also CPU/GPU mining or faucets but those aren't going to generate any useful amount of coins.

Right now all the 'silver' change I get goes from my pocket into a bin, and a couple times a year that goes into a Coinstar machine at the grocery store, which generates Amazon gift card code, which I take home and enter on the computer. I can't see my cafeteria ever using this (their card swipe looks to be 40 years old) but it would be cool with me if they did. Instead of the silver just print a QR on the receipt (their receipt printers are probably too old to print bitmaps) that I can scan with my phone.

One time I read about kidnappers who demanded an amount of cash in unmarked bills with non-sequential serial numbers. *shrug*. In this case there was a demand made for bitcoin, which is the only reason the story was noticed by a web site which covers bitcoin. The story had no slant of "OMG bitcoin is evil because bad people use it". Nor was such a slant warranted. There's really nothing to see here. Move along.

I bought one 50GH unit, and it also took many months longer than it should have to be delivered. Whether I broke even/lost/profited depends on when you ask - I paid USD but haven't spent the BTC mined (still spending from the lot I bought on Gox, and transferred out of there quickly thank you very much). If I sold today it would be negative. So I won't. But yeah I agree with your assessment of them (even though my hardware worked perfectly).

It's a long shot but you could look at what letters are in this phrase but not in the other, working phrase(s), and concentrate on permutations there. Letter doubled, hit the key to the left of it, spelled "ei" instead of "ie", etc. Or figure out your personal common typos - for example one thing I do myself fairly frequently is spell "options" as "optinos". I assume you've already decided it isn't a case of out-clevering yourself, using "3" for "e" or the like.

It took more than a week but they did eventually get back to me. Once they did, they resolved the issue quickly. I'm not saying it took a week to verify me, I'm saying it took a week to answer an email. So I'm still not sure about them. Unlikely to know any more until I use them, if I ever do.

It's clearly possible that the Santa has a clipboard and a pen and apologetically tells you that you have to write down your information before you can toss change in the bucket. It will never be required because Salvation Army is an arm of a religious organization favored by many politicians. Organizations which are not so favored have to be more careful. (I'm not saying that SA does anything bad) Also they've been doing this a long time, since before government thought they had a need to know who was giving donations to who.

Beats me. I don't worry about it much because I think countries and religions with that "don't you dare mock our king/prophet" mindset are just too ridiculous to take seriously. But this could be useful for spreading information that governments try to restrict like the algorithm for undoing DVD encryption (isn't that what used to be on t-shirts?).

Anti Money Laundering laws are bullshit. The state has no _legitimate_ interest in how someone moves his money around. What they _do_ have a legitimate interest in is actions - if someone explodes a bomb in a shopping mall, you bet I want law enforcement looking into it. But it's not proper for them to be looking into who gave that perpetrator money, and certainly not into people who took no wrong actions but happened to move large sums of money around.
That said, I estimate the chances of rescinding AML at zero. We are going to have to continue to deal with it whenever we deal with fiat currency. So yeah, let's do as much as we can purely in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:01:40
So ... they convert bitcoin to fiat and add that fiat to your PayPal account? In that case I would not say that you can send bitcoins to PayPal accounts. Really only PayPal can let you do that. Nitpicking maybe.

Are cabbies still a common target for robbery because they carry cash? Seems like there was something on the news every night in the '80s. I suppose accepting bitcoin doesn't really help that situation until you accept *only* bitcoin, and advertise it ("driver carries no cash" sign on the car).

Looks to me like a bunch of investors, plus some lawyers, decided they wanted a piece of this action and filed a lawsuit to get it. It does not look like they ever had any intent to punish anyone or discourage anyone from doing this again in the future - they just wanted a payoff.
I'm not saying that I _like_ any of this but it sounds to me like we have no cause to be outraged at this settlement unless we're among the forex traders who lost money. We just want to see criminal charges brought and criminal punishments meted out against those lousy rotten bankers.

I guess I had the same experience as everyone else, buying something trivial at Radio Shack with cash and having my phone number demanded of me. I tried to point out that there was no legitimate need for it - I look back on it now and wonder what the heck I was thinking, you can't change anything by talking to a clerk. Embarrassing. Eventually of course I had to lie to them and make up a number just to get my resistors or whatever it was. This was so long ago that Radio Shack actually sold electronic parts rather than just cell phones and phone accessories.
Yeah, like everyone else is saying Bitcoin won't solve this kind of thing. Only thing that might help is taking your business elsewhere and telling someone at the company who can raise the issue to the level where they can do something about it why you are doing so. That's actually easier today since you can start an online petition or some social media movement and gather a significant number of irate customers quickly.

Unless they've got you locked up because they can see that you are one of those bitcoin-using criminals, because only criminals use bitcoin, and you can't buy a new Trezor from jail. They haven't stolen your bitcoins, so that's an improvement, but they've denied you access to them. Would be better if they didn't recognize the wallet in the first place.
Recent rulings suggest that if you have a phone which is unlocked by fingerprint you can be compelled by police to unlock the phone. Would this extend to a wallet unlocked by fingerprint? Are they then legally allowed to move those bitcoins? I don't know.
@_date: 2015-02-16 12:37:22
Make it a transparent safe - anyone can see how many coins are owned by address X. Also when the thief 'moves' your coins he leaves behind a note with the address of his safe - the movement is a transaction recorded in the public ledger, N coins from address X to address Y. That's why they will split the total into a hundred pieces and move each into a different safe, then move them again, etc., but that's beyond the original question.
