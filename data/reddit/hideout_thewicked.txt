I have a few thousand dollars somewhere from tips years ago and I can't seem to find it. Kind of sucks but what can you do?

Tipping service. I still have access to the account I just have no idea how to find out which service. I can't search my comment replies, just my comments and they were tips for comments.

Does the last 1,000 count based solely on time? I had some top level comments that were highly upvoted that I can't find. I will also take a look at work tomorrow and see if I can track anything down. I will check all the big tips bots. I appreciate your help with this. If we manage to track this down I will gladly hit you with some of whatever we find. I had all but given up on it.

I wonder if that only goes back so far? I only seem to have 4 and they only go back 3 years. I checked a few other accounts that I don't really use anymore and none of them have any.

I don't remember the comment. I thought one was a high up voted comment and tried looking one time but never found it. The other I know was a low rated comment and I'm pretty sure is buried too deep in my account to find. There are 2-3 plus comments I have got tips on before. Trust me, I have gone looking before when bitcoin hit 17k and I couldn't find anything.

Says no matching changetip for my account. Happen to know any others that would have been going around a few years back?
