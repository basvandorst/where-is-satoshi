:) So much hate. But only one thing. Most bitcoiners are good people, they care and they understand moral principles. If you feel that you must transfer your insecure and hate to someone please target me.

"They don't realize the sacrifices that have been made by other for years so that Dogecoin could even exist." - sorry btcveteran, can me explain your sacrifices? And for clarification, I'm old bitcoiner, maybe older than you, and I saw hate and lack of fundamental understanding in the past (and now) for bitcoin. And I'm tired now of all of this, but dogecoin community show me something that I forgot long time ago - that bitcoin is not about to became rich quickly but to change people thinking about their view of currency and true value.  And yes "Go read the posts, it's all out in the open." Have a nice day.

Sorry but what sacrifices? Can you give me just one example? Of course you can't. But this is not important. You are pissed about some donations, really? You are angry but I don't know why. I read bad things about bitcoin then and now. And I read bad things about dogecoin also. Old arguments, old mistakes. I don't want to argue with you because it doesn't make sense. And I apologize if I hurt your feelings. This is my favorite novel (sorry I can't find full version online)   I really wish you peace of mind. Good luck.

You are really sad person. So much hate. I hope you will feel better. Have a nice day.
