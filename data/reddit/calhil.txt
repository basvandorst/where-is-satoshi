Or satoshi is a group of people, only some of which knew about b-money previously.

Then why not just buy BTC instead of mining equipment? Unless you have free or very cheap electricity you wont make profit mining.

So exactly how much energy do you need to create 1 bitcoin? How much energy does one need to create an equivalent of 1 bitcoin in fiat currency?
Even at the current prices and costs of mining, bitcoin system is much cheaper.

I would rather write my own bittorrent client than pay for one.

Does anyone at coinbase know who Satoshi Nakamoto really is?

How do you want to assign someones id to a bitcoin address? Also how would you prove ownership of that address?

Why do you think the number of nodes would increase? So far the node number has decreased significantly (from ~10k in 2014 to less than 6k now). Running a full node with 50MB blocks would require a lot of storage, which is just unavailable for normal users because of the costs.

A lot of nodes are set up on small vps/kvm servers and while 250 or 500GB is not that expensive, larger hdd capacities can get pricey.
Not many people are willing to have a dedicated computer (or even their own desktop) running 24/7.

I wonder how many full nodes would remain if bitcoin processed 15 million tpd.

Trading volume on that exchange seems to be really low.

 - thats a polish bank owned by tmobile. They probably process all the payments in PLN/EUR/GBP/CHF themselves and dont need another bank to do it for them. 
Besides, in Poland (and probably everywhere else in eu) companies are forbidden to conduct larger payments in cash, they need to use a bank transfer.

Thats also not true. You can pay with cash (EUR/PLN) in tmobile retail stores. You can actually pay using euro everywhere in EU.
@_date: 2015-03-11 14:27:29
This is actually not true. Tmobile doesnt accept bitcoin, they just cooperate with a payment processor company - inpay.pl
Nevertheless, 20% more is quite nice ;]

How do you determine which nodes were the first to broadcast the transaction? You would probably need another separate blockchain for that.
