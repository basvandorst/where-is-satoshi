If you're not a lawyer then you're not subject to the rules of professional conduct governing lawyers and their ethics. The law says ignorance of the law is no excuse.  So if you're not a lawyer then you're not giving legal advice and these people are responsible for themselves. (I'm assuming US in my answer.) 
Also - NOT LEGAL ADVICE. FOR INFO PURPOSES ONLY. ;)

Be prepared for the principal to side with the teacher. But don't go on the defensive. The kid can and should write whatever he wants so long as his argument is sound. It's the teacher who, as the proponent of a statement, has the burden of proof for that statement. Don't make your child go to her level and disprove a statement with no logical basis. Similarly with the principal should they side with the teacher.  This is a great learning opportunity for him to not lose confidence in himself when faced with disagreement without proof.

I think this is a great idea.  Imagine having a distributed worldwide lottery.  Depending on how you set it up, the odds could be extremely small, but the payout could make someone a billionaire.  What if that winner was in a small village in Africa?  All of the sudden that village has access capital they've never seen before.  Then a percent could go to transparent and reviewed charities and the charities could also be under a smaller lottery system so the same charity doesn't always win.

That's not necessarily libertarianism so much as it is voluntaryism.  Ask yourself, if you did not have significant portion of your income taken from you, would you be more inclined to donate to causes you find worthy?  Would you donate to charities who are not transparent or doing business with others you don't want to support?  The free market would permit only those businesses or groups which are most efficient and honest to survive.  
Placing an attribute on an another person or group often reflects an inner mentality.  Maybe your 'people' wouldn't donate, but I and the people in my life would if we had more freedom to choose and more knowledge about who we were donating to.

Sorry I've been absent from my own post - been in meetings all morning.. I did some more digging, and apparently this article was posted a couple days ago on r/law, which I wasn't subscribed to. I spend way too much time with bitcoin ;).
Anyways, this [guy]( had a good write-up analyzing the article.  Be warned his post is mostly a rant but there is some good legal info.   
This person links to an order the article was referring to.  *However*, DickWhiskey has a quote from [the order]( which could conceivably be pertinent to bitcoin:  




It is further ordered that to the extent that data on the iOS device is encrypted, Apple may provide a copy of the encrypted data to law enforcement but Apple is not required to attempt to decrypt, or otherwise enable law enforcement's attempts to access encrypted data.
However, the Order he supposedly got this from does *not* contain the language he quotes.  I don't know where he got this language.   As I read the Order, I saw there was one case which could have implications in a person being required to hand over their private keys when encrypted or otherwise protected.  (This hypothetical should be contrasted from situations like Silk Road 2.0 where the keys were accessible on the computer without encryption.)  
A ruling in [*United States v. Fricosu*, 841 F. Supp. 2d 1232, 1238 (D. Colo. 2012)]( found that under the All Writs law and doctrines, the one discussed in the article (which have been reviewed by the Supreme Court as recently as 2002), a person can be required under warrant to provide the password to encrypted computers or files.  Please note, these rulings have nothing to do with bitcoin, seizure of assets, takings, etc.  But the legal argument could be made on some remote level that a person could be required to give up a password to their private keys.  
*BIG fat disclaimer.  I am a civil, NOT a criminal, attorney and this post is in no way legal advice.*

Often when I hear this argument I think it's an issue people are having with bitcoin being deflationary and the 21m hard limit.  This automatically creates a problem for people who think government or some other central authority should pay for social programs, warfare, etc. That can't be done with a deflationary currency without everyone who owns some of the currency chipping into the effort voluntarily. Inflationary currencies on the other hand don't really have that problem because the currency can be endlessly divided.  Add that to fiat where a government says 1 dollar equals 1 dollar by law and the division of the currency doesn't mean much (at first). 
The blockchain (Bitcoin big b) can and has been forked hundreds of times already and some of those forks have created inflationary (no hard limit) cryptos with varying forms of centralization/decentralization (proof of stake, dpos, etc).  So I think when people say little b bitcoin is bad I think on some level they disagree with its inability to inflate. Also possibly the centralization issue but I think the inflation one is more fundamental than that in this case. 
Edit- at work so I didn't watch the youtube video you linked so I may not be in the ballpark. apologies if that's the case

This is a bit beyond my technical know how. I just started reading about meshnets recently. From what I understand servers and all that still exist but on much smaller scales - so no monster centralized server farms and the blockchain can be used for micro payments to incentivize operating and for secure data transfer. Or I think something like storj cloud storage would work where small nodes with spare memory could store pieces of all internet data. Again micro payments could incentivize this. Ideally there would be many copies of this data so nodes could come and go on the network with no effect to others.  So I think the answer is that clusters of nodes would act as the ISP. And there would be many many clusters.

She definitely tips the regulatory hand at just how closely they are watching the news and how well FinCEN and the other bodies 'get it.'  It seems they get it pretty well.

@_date: 2014-11-19 03:53:27
In all seriousness though do you think these entities are that nimble and coordinated to pull something like this in secret? Bitcoin is such a novel concept that 2014 has in large part been the first year we've seen any glimmer of understanding of the technology from institutions, and that's of bitcoin circa 2009.  I agree with you that this threat is not to be taken lightly but I often question just how effective the governments are such that they could pull something like this off while doing all their other 'projects'.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:59:07
OpenBazaar is a decentralized market place that only accepts bitcoin (for now).  So you download a bittorrent-like client and access the openbazaar network.  Each client can be it's own store front.  So instead of everyone going into amazon's marketplace to set up a storefront, there is no central market place to shut down.  Once inside the openbazaar client, most everything is encrypted so an outsider can't tell what exactly the transaction is (AFAIK).  In order to shut down the openbazaar network, you'd have to shut down every client running the software.  Just like bittorrent and bitcoin.

Well honestly I thought that I was getting that message because I never had backed up my account or eveneven seen my seed, and when I went to backup the account those would be included.  After reading kommstar below I see what I did wrong. I misunderstood that the seed is just for an account not the whole wallet. I figured that *all* addresses (single or no), accounts and keys in the whole wallet were derived from the seed. I backed up one account but not the other addresses I had generated ooutsideutside the account. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 22:16:38
Honestly that's exactly what I was going to do because I know that process the best and then was like nah this is what the seed is for.. sweet.

Sorry PiGuy i tried everything I could think of but electrum won't accept my seed (phrasing!).  I can't enter it when creating a new wallet and the 'next' button won't enable when I try to do the recovery option.  
@_date: 2015-05-03 00:25:34
Yeah I guess that's just what I've been used to - using single addresses without HD deriving - so I stuck with it despite the 'hey guy like seriously stick with what's easy' warnings haha. 
I'm not blaming mycellium at all.  They have a great product. I definitely hadn't taken the time to fully understand the differences in 2.0   and rarely used the wallet. It was my fault for not thinking through it. Lesson learned though.
I do appreciate your taking the time to respond to all this. Really helped me understand it better. To answer your earlier question I think a quick pop up when you install mycellium that simply defines the differences between HD accounts, single addresses, and how each is backed up would be very helpful. So like "an HD account is... Its backed up by writing the seed. An individually generated address is... And is backed up by...". Just a thought. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 18:55:15
Traded it in and got some money for it (not half a btc worth haha). But I watched the guys wipe it unfortunately.  And I didn't realize that about the 2.0. Most likely all my addresses were from the old version. Thanks for clarifying.

@_date: 2017-08-17 13:52:25
I was not complaining about the private company acting privately.  I fully agree that a private company has rights and can choose to do or not do business with whomever they want.  In this case apple is acting as an intermediary for that business transaction.  But they are determining that one party to the transaction is 'disreputable' and censoring their ability to do the transaction with the other party.  
Yes - while the party has agreed to apple's TOS and presumably to the risk of being censored, the problem is that our society relies so heavily on these third parties as intermediaries to conduct business.  Same thing with banks.  What happens when banks won't cash your checks and close your accounts because you associate with the wrong people?  Economic censorship by third parties creates a massive problem for free speech.
Bitcoin is absolutely a hack around the issue and that is why it is so important an invention. It mathematically guarantees economic free speech across borders.

@_date: 2017-08-17 13:58:41
I've seen some of the idea that LN reintroduces centralization.  Although I don't know the technical details well enough to gauge the amount of centralization.  I doubt, however, that LN will ever be centralized to the extent that Apple Pay is centralized.  Decentralization --&gt; Centralization is shades of grey, not binary.  Bitcoin on chain transactions are certainly the most decentralized, but if you are willing to risk more centralization for the convenience of faster transactions, then that is an economic choice.  
Yes, I suppose it is possible that transactions could be censored. But I imagine it would be a long time before we see the moral/political censorship that is described in the link.  Increasing the difficulty of censorship is the goal.  LN doesn't return us to full centralization and full risk of censorship.  So I'm not too worried about it.
