 I was wondering, what if the people who issue these ETF's KNOW they will fail and just capitalize on the panic every time it gets denied?
​Why do we suddenly even care so much about it? All you can hear is ETF this ETF that, how are we so easy to control.

The people who bought because they thought it would get them rich qucik are being filtered out, like every cycle. This explains the massive drops, it's human psychology: People hear the succes, they want to get in, they see it goes downhill and they panic. 
But out of these there is a legitimate growth (the people who learn about blockchain) that's why we have these new bases. I think it's not crazy to say that this cycle will repeat itself again and again untill we actually do reach mass adoption (replacement of FIAT) which is definately not the case. 
Just look around and ask who is invested in cryptocurrency at this time, there is a growing interest for sure, but it's still so small for what is aims to be. That's why I don't think we have reached this ceiling yet and I don't even think we will reach it until it either replaces FIAT or if it actually fails and plummets to the ground.
The fact is there has been a patern for the last years, the question is when will the pattern break.

I'm not saying it IS going going to happen because it happened 4 times already, I'm saying the pattern now is EXACTLY the same has back in 2014 (check the 1 Month view) so there is a POSSIBILITY that it will happen. 
Also there has to be general opinion of "The golden days are over" because otherwise it would never happen. It's always the minority that got it right with these huge gains because there has to be a majority of losers. (again not saying it WILL happen)
As a last point, 1000% increase may be very optimistic, but it doesn't have to be that much. I think if you buy at 4k (if it ever gets there) there is a good chance it will bring good profit. (in my opinion)
To add to this last point: Does anyone know for certain what is going to happen? No. So I think the potential gain Versus the potential risk at this moment looks promising for the first time since mid 2015.

I understand where you are coming from. Nothing is certain, especially not in this market. 
All I am saying is that the pattern is there and until this point it hasn't failed even once. We will see what the future will bring, if the pattern breaks or if it repeats itself. We will know very soon. Might even have this same discussion in 5 years if the pattern holds or might have a totally different conversation if the pattern breaks.
Can I ask what do you think is the most likely thing that will happen and is happening at the moment?

I was thinking about this, what if we see the exact same thing happening? Bitcoin price will drop to 3000-4000 usd and after maybe 1-2 years it will rise to 400.000 usd.
That means the it would be a golden opportunity to invest in the coming months.
Anyway, nothing is certain but I think there is a decent chance it will happen.

I'm shocked by the fact that you can even say things like there is no possibilty, if everything was so self explanatory in this market then why are people condtantly being surprised by the movement of crypto. 
If you even assumed a price increase of 100% back in 2014 people would call you crazy and give numerous so called reasons why it is impossible. Yet again and again people let them surprise themselves. 
Why would it be different this time? Because again it is impossible? Like all other times back in the day where all sort of experts called it impossible? 
Again I want to emphisize that I'm not saying it will happen but if you just look at it without emotion (just as a graph) then it's safe yo say that thete IS a possibility that it could happen. Maybe for reasons that are not clear to us today but will be after the event happens.

I think selling now would be the absolute worst thing to do, and it's true that many people think (including me) that in the future, bitcoin or a cryptocurrency will replace FIAT, but the question is will it happen in our lifetime?

Can you explain please, I'm not sure what this tells besides that Bitcoin has a growing interest that will eventually surpass dollar on search terms. 
Which is logic because you need to search bitcoin on the internet to be able to buy it.
