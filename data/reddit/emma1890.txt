 bitcoin is five years time in my opinion there will be a lot of hard forks from the original bitcoin blockchain and the value of bitcoin would increase by 300 percent today's price. if transaction's speed and price remains the same, bitcoin's not improving and maybe the price wont grow that much

 First of all: stop using the disk... Any sector that has been overwritten is more or less lost... I've heared about 3 letter agencies that can potentially recover an overwritten sector, but for a normal guy on a normal budget, you should consider sectors that have been overwritten as lost...

There's a lot more verbage involved, but that's the short-form basic information you need.  I suspect state and local income taxes (where applicable) have to follow the IRS rulings on the subject.

 Of course it does, because somehow when people knew about that banks do accept it then they would try to interact with it and there will be more volume inside the crypto space.

  Some believe that Bitcoin is for making money quickly changing the mind of people from negative to positive is difficult since Bitcoin is not accepted by everyone, we can explain about the advantages and disadvantages to the people and make them aware of Bitcoin .

I'm not too far along but what I love about it is that it doesn't get into Bitcoin right away. He first talks about why all other forms of money/trade are outdated (I agree). why would you direct people to another project. Cause you may not prefer bitcoin (you have to respect the people it has working on it), it’s going to be the standard on any future crypto project.

It looks like 2018 will be a landmark year when it comes to the IRS and taxing cryptocurrency gains. The IRS treats cryptocurrency as property, so there are capital gain implications. The best way to minimize is to buy and hold for more than a year.Let's look at specific crypto transactions and their tax implications:
* **Trading cryptocurrencies** produces capital gains or losses, with the latter being able to offset gains and reduce tax.
* **Exchanging** one token for another — for example, using Ethereum to purchase an altcoin — creates a taxable event. The token is treated as being sold, thus generating capital gains or losses.
* **Receiving payments in crypto** in exchange for products or services or as salary is treated as ordinary income at the fair market value of the coin at the time of receipt.
* **Spending crypto** is a tax event and may generate capital gains or losses, which can be short-term or long-term. For example, say you bought one coin for $100. If that coin was then worth $200 and you bought a $200 gift card, there is a $100 taxable gain. Depending on the holding period, it could be a short- or long-term capital gain subject to different rates.
* **Converting a cryptocurrency** to U.S. dollars or another currency at a gain is a taxable event, as it is treated as being sold, thus generating capital gains.
* **Air drops** are considered ordinary income on the day of the air drop. That value will become the basis of the coin. When it's sold, exchanged, etc., there will be a capital gain.
* **Mining coins** is considered ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the coin the day it was successfully mined.
* **Initial coin offerings** do not fall under the IRS's tax-free treatment for raising capital. Thus, they produce ordinary income to individuals and businesses alike.
