Whenever anybody raises obvious problems like this, there are people that roll in and start listing all the standard solutions that no normal person is ever going to go through the trouble with, and blame btc losses on stupidity.  
Not only is there a problem with security but more important, the people involved in creating solutions apparently have no idea how normal people think or what they want.  They keep trying to cram this square peg in a round hole and getting angry at the hole for not cooperating.

This has been my only, but serious problem with BCH, the insistence in creating confusion with the public by hijacking r/btc on reddit and using every opportunity to do the same wherever possible.  I used to respect Roger Ver and take him seriously but his role in this convinced me that he's not an honest player in the space. He was accused of acting in bad faith in the past but I ignored all that as gossip and bad blood but not anymore. 
 I pretty much dropped out of the subs because they all became so toxic but every once in a while I drop in to see what people are talking about and while I'd like to see multiple coins succeed, including bch I just don't trust what a lot of certain high profile people say anymore.
The best thing that bitcoin cash people could do is embrace their unique name and symbol and let everybody move forward without the constant sniping.

Thanks to the btc community for confirming my decision to step away months ago.  As much as I love the technology, I have never found myself around as large a group of tantrum throwing babies.

But the problem is that people keep trying to invent the 7 wheeled car.  Sure, a 7 wheeled car would probably have a superior turning radius as well as exceptional handling and other benefits that can't even be imagined right now.  And if you introduced one with all those benefits, but had 3 different steering wheels that had to be operated simultaneously, people simply would refuse to adopt because they wouldn't have the intelligence to pick it up or the patience to even try.  
You can create a clearly superior technology with all the potential benefits in the world, but if normal people, children and grandmas, can't use it with relative ease, then normal people won't.  
I'm on my 4th week of trying to guide my aged mother through using a new smartphone.  Hopefully I'll finally get her to understand how to use email and all of that but she sure as hell would never be able to use bitcoin as it currently exist.  She'd lose everything.  
So when you talk about idiots, you have to consider who's really responsible for bringing the masses and the technology together.  When you use that perspective, it makes you rethink who the real idiots are.

The topic is not even about fresh new people being taken advantage of.  It's about entire companies springing up, collecting a lot of wealth and then dropping off the map.  The issue is about everybody having a careful look at any company before using it or praising it's products.  And about the community self policing.  
Yes, we all have responsibilities but if what you are saying is true, that people only buy lies, then we might as well shut down bitcoin now.  Why even try if everybody is too stupid to use it?

Gox has been notorious for major failures for a long time and only remained in the spotlight because of the huge share of the market it had gained and its ability to be the one exchange always cited by the media when it talked about bitcoin.  To suggest that people weren't aware or talking about the troubles at Gox is to simply show a lack of awareness of the community.  I've advised friends for months to avoid Gox at all costs.  
If you know very much about bitcoin then you know how wrong the media constantly gets it and so doesn't it make sense that they'd get Gox wrong as well?

How they managed to get payments has nothing to do with the fact that the community is crawling with scammers and the community seems to be flailing about waiting for the next bogus company to pop up, make amazing promises and take people's money (in whatever manner they choose) and then disappear or announce that they were hacked.

I'm a big believer in micropayment, especially for internet services so if Changtip ended up more involved with that then it would be fine.  But I hate this tipping thing.  It creates oddly uncomfortable situations where people feel they have to say thank you for some stranger tossing them the equivalent of a penny.

When I said cannot be duplicated I meant cannot be counterfeited.  The main goal would be to be able to say "Person A gave Person B document 1001 and we know with confidence that B now owns that specific document (1001).  If Person C comes along and says "I have document 1001." then the system would establish whether that is true or not by the blockchain and a system that proves it is not a counterfeit.
This prevents person B from sending along a copy posing as the original etc.

I'm not sure I understand how retail usage provides more stability than remittance.  Remittance is retail I suppose so it's part of the mix anyway.  And in currency transfers, there will be larger volume of bitcoins on average than individual small transactions for consumer goods.  
And as far as volatility affecting value, in an international remittance, the conversion from local fiat to btc to local fiat could be done so quickly that any volatility would be practically insignificant.  Volatility actually creates a much more difficult situation when dealing in retail sales since returns have a very real issue with customers potentially using them to play with changing values.  I don't know of any bitcoin retailer that offers returns of goods bought with bitcoin.  Most tell you upfront that any bitcoin purchased items are only able to be exchanged.
More importantly, right now, as of today, if I buy anything with bitcoin online etc. the advantage for me or the retailer is practically nil beyond the novelty.  But thousands of people can realize huge savings that actually have an impact on their lives with the use of bitcoin to send their wealth from one country to another.

Yes we have moved forward, and we've finally started getting rid of some of the dead weight that was burdening bitcoin.  And if you're grading by how it was a year ago, then yeah, it's changed a lot.  But not enough. 
There is still a long way to go before it is ready for the mainstream and by the way, telling the general public that if they lose a large sum of bitcoin it is because they are idiots, well that's not going to fly.  It will simply kill bitcoin or set it back even more.  
"Oh, you've got to try out bitcoin, it's the future and will change your life!"
then 
"You had 50 bitcoin stolen?  You must have done something wrong dummy."
That is not a conversation that is acceptable with the general public.

Another equal problem is that there are also bitcoin fanatics who call you a troll if you don't jump on whatever bandwagon happens to be rolling down the street at that particular moment.  Any expression of doubt about a particular company or the viability of bitcoin as a consumer product at this particular moment in its development is met with howls of rage from those that absolutely will not allow another opinion.  
My involvement in btc related forums has been reduced to a trickle because as much as I believe in it, I want to always look at it through clear eyes and as rationally as possible.  I have no interest in bitcoin as a political movement or religion.  I am strictly interested in its capabilities as a new payment system and the future applications of the blockchain.  All of that excites me and the rest bores me to tears.
I've even stopped listening to podcasts I used to regularly follow because I realized that any bozo that was selling whatever ridiculous product could be sure to get some promo with absolutely no critical eye towards them by putting themselves out there for interviews.  They don't even have to have ever actually accepted bitcoin.  Just create a wallet and send out emails. 
The bitcoin community is extremely immature and although I don't understand the haters that like to waste their time bashing btc (they really must have very boring lives), it's even more difficult for me to deal with a great deal of bitcoin enthusiasts.

Not even sure what the point of that is but just because others are corrupt or incompetent, doesn't mean that bitcoin businesses shouldn't be called out for their problems.

I understand your point and it's a good one.  I'm simply making another one. That is that even with better paper wallets, bitcoin is still not user friendly for normal people.  
Better paper wallets would be awesome but there are much greater problems that need to be solved as well.  And so the onus is on bitcoin developers as well as proponents and 3rd parties to create a safe and secure system that if not eliminates paper wallets, at least makes the rare or never needed.

Repeatedly claim that bitcoin is going to destroy the existing system.  Claim that bitcoin is beyond the controls of power.  Refuse to make any effort to work with authority to address legitimate concerns, or call those that do various names.  
Ridicule and rebut investors that want to bring bitcoin into the mainstream.  Try to politicize bitcoin and claim that it serves a particular political philosophy.  Decry efforts to make bitcoin more user friendly.

People that worry about early adopters being rewarded are missing the entire point of bitcoin.  People gain from bitcoin in the benefits of usage.  If I use $100 of bitcoin in transactions, it doesn't matter to me how much a bitcoin is worth, what matters is that I am able to exchange my funds using the technology.  If I want to send $1,000 back to my village on the other side of the world, my family in the village will get $1,000 worth of bitcoin as long as the price of btc has remained stable whether btc is $500 or $10,000.

Well, there are 95 different points to go through.  I'm not even sure what  means but how about 2?  "Markets consist of human beings, not demographic sectors."
We have never had any moment in human history in which demographics have been more important to markets than today.  To use the most simple example, watch how networks follow their ratings.  Today the number people pay most attention to is the preferred demographic, not the total number.  
Markets are all about demographics.

I know heads will explode over this but comments on this thread make me wonder if there ever was a consideration to reference the quantity of bitcoin by value in fiat currencies?  I agree that name changes for things arbitrarily for marketing purposes can come across as scammy but perhaps there should be serious consideration for doing so in order to remove understandable confusion because of similar names for different things in this world.  Something as simple as changing the unit to "BTC" would probably help.  "I bought $50 in btc." or "I bought 10,000 satoshis of btc."  
This shouldn't be approached as a way to market btc but as a way to solve a clear problem that was mistakenly created during the development of Bitcoin.
The whole idea that if I start a sentence with "Bitcoin" could be confusing because the reader now is not sure if I'm referencing the units or protocol is crazy.

this has been my theory about the evolution of bitcoin for a while, certain people have a number of coins and when the price reaches a certain set number, they'll cash out (bitcoin is $5,000? I'm a millionaire!) causing a dip in the price.   But I would expect that during a price rise.  
The greater opportunity to buy from retailers is the interesting development because I can't remember anybody anticipating that reducing the price but instead it's always said to be one step closer to the moon.  
I'm in btc for the long run so these things don't bother me so much as make me curious.

The whole tipping thing is a bit weird to me in a lot of ways.  I mean, in no other situation would it seem normal for one person to randomly pull out some money and give to another because they either appreciate their insight or are just doing it randomly.  In fact in most situations it would be considered rude.  
Bill and Ted are part of a group of people in conversation.
"Bill, I like the point you just made and here's a nickel for rising to the occasion."
"What?  Are you kidding me?  Fuck you and your nickel."
or 
"That's a good point Bill, here's $5."
Now bill has actually received something of real value.  He can appreciate it or be offended as before, but what's definitely changed if he accepts is his position in the relationship.  Now Bill has accepted Ted's largesse and Bill is compromised.  His opinion toward Ted and his points in any debate are forever compromised.  
I get that there are much more noble reasons for tipping but I think they really do complicate what should be very simple relationships and not for the better.

It's going to be a great day when the bitcoin community stops blaming people for not getting into bitcoin and realize that any problems that exist with bitcoins are directly related to the inability of the community to make btc user friendly and easy to understand by normal people.  
The way btc enthusiasts like to disparage ppl who stumble or have problems after trying to get involved with bitcoin is ridiculous.  The public doesn't owe bitcoin anything.  The public doesn't have to step up their game or put in an effort to learn about bitcoin.  The public can and will make their choices based on what's most comfortable and easy.  
It's bitcoin and its developers that are failing here.  For all the brainpower involved, bitcoin is simply not ready for prime time and it would be best to just stop trying to push it on people at this time.  Develop it more and get it ready, then launch.

Crappy article but there is something to be said about some of the cultish behavior in the btc community.  As soon as you start believing things are "inevitable", you stop thinking rationally.  Nothing is inevitable.  Everything is subject to chance.  
Bitcoin isn't immune to the same random events in the world and life that have unexpected consequences at moments that nobody could predict.  
But what concerns me most about some in the bitcoin community is the attempt to assign a political philosophy to bitcoin.  I don't belong to a political party and my political beliefs don't fit a single label.  So I'm certainly not interested in my money being political. Maybe there will be political consequences of its usage but as soon as I feel like using bitcoin assigns me to any political group, I'm outta here. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:23:02
Agreed.  I got caught up in seeing patterns early on and while I think there is a general pattern that can be detected after the fact, rapid increase, dramatic drop, stabilization period, it can't be predicted beforehand.  And that's the problem for people that look for patterns.  When and why can't be predicted.

I was reading this great, simple explanation of bitcoin  and it started with the metaphor of an apple.  That made me wonder if the protocol could be applied to other digital files.  I know the capabilities are being developed for contracts, notaries etc are being developed but it made me wonder about this.  
I don't even know the practical application I'm thinking about.  Just whether People could create a digital file of which there is only one legitimate copy that could be transferred from one person to the next and everything is recorded and confirmed as authentic just as bitcoin is.  
The blockchain makes it impossible to double spend a bitcoin so why not any other digital file?
@_date: 2014-04-30 02:53:24
Yes, weaknesses need to be revealed and fixed now before bitcoin is more widely used.  I certainly agree with that.  My concern is that too many weaknesses remain while bitcoin is being promoted to the mainstream.

Wallets have to develop in a much greater way than they do currently for bitcoin to become mainstream.  "Uneducated and lazy", or "normal" users have no time or interest in creating paper wallets with extremely long passwords that if compromised put their entire store of wealth at risk.  Bitcoin experts can preach and harangue and generally try to convince people that they must go through all the necessary steps (including the ridiculous like using a printer that has never touched the internet) all they want but the reality is that normal people will not bother if something is that convoluted and difficult.  The problem lies with current wallets, the end. 
What is needed is something that allows probably 3 stages of security in, ideally, one wallet.  Stage one is fully liquid.  If I need to spend my btc, then I can do it immediately with little to no friction.  This serves the function of the fiat the wallet in my back pocket.  If I lose that, I'm just sol.  So only a limited amount of funds, the amount I feel comfortable with that low level of security, is available. 
Stage 2 is access to a larger sum, up to a limit the user has placed.  It requires a significant password and perhaps two factor authentication.  This would allow access to the kind of money needed for travel, large purchases etc.  Basically replaces the functions of bank and credit cards.  
Stage 3 is for the largest pool of funds that need to have ultimate security.  Access to these funds require enough effort that it's basically impossible to be lost or stolen.  I assume this requires a third party to provide that extra level of security and would introduce a necessary time lag in accessing the funds.  Maybe a whole hour or something.  But the point is that the user can feel as secure as they do with money currently residing in a bank without worrying that they've made some mistake along the way.  
Until that kind of wallet is commonplace, I don't think bitcoin will ever be mainstream.
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:54:04

I like your list except for number 4.  If board members are prohibited from owning "profit interests" in bitcoin, does that mean they can't own bitcoin at all?  Or is that limited to interest in Bitcoin related companies?
While I understand the motive to keep board members from having a conflict of interest, this could create a situation where you have an entire board of people that have NO interest in bitcoin.  
Seems that anybody on the board need to have interest in bitcoin because of their own involvement in order to ensure they care and want to do what is best for everybody.

I've come to the conclusion that the rush to get vendors to accept bitcoin could be detrimental in bitcoin's growth.  The technology is simply not ready for mainstream yet and there's a very good chance that the most open minded retailers are going to end up feeling burned because they made an effort that only ended in tears.  
Instead of pushing to create a world where we can buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin, maybe the effort should be focused on areas where bitcoin provides immediate and clear advantages like international money transfers.

But people also want convenience and btc simply isn't convenient right now.  People can make all the arguments they want about how awesome btc is and how convenient it is and how anybody who expresses a doubt is a troll but real people don't care about any of that.  They care about their experience.  And they care about their money.  And as long as btc endangers either or both, it will remain an experiment.  
And before I get labeled a troll, I'm a big believer in bitcoin and have been involved for a couple of years now.  But I've come to realize that all of the efforts to mainstream it ahead of it being ready for the mainstream are ill advised and often, if not usually, end in tears.  
Round peg, square hole and all of that.

I guess where we disagree is the word "accept".  I think a system of openness, non governance etc. absolutely demands that participants police others in various ways.  One way would be to loudly and frequently call out bad actors and make it clear that their activities are unacceptable.  
One of the reasons that government controls are so readily embraced is this lack of internal policing.  This goes back to childhood.  There's always some jerk who's going to ruin it for everybody else because they just can't act like a decent human being.  
If people truly want to see bitcoin develop with minimal government interference then the users and developers of bitcoin have to develop zero tolerance for improper behavior.  If you don't want the government involved you have to have a system that is safe and enjoyable for everybody.
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:35:43
I don't think that word means what you think it does.  
I understand the potential for bitcoin and am more interested in the technology than the payments side.  But I also see the necessity to make bitcoin simple and easy enough for everybody to use before it is ever going to be able to go mainstream.  And it will never become stable and usable until enough developers, assisted in a lot of ways by Vcs etc, make that possible.  
Just because you want something to be a certain way doesn't mean it will.  
@_date: 2014-01-25 03:03:29
Thanks for the comments.  Yes, I understand supply/demand etc. but was looking for other thoughts on what is currently driving the price.

@_date: 2014-01-28 11:45:03
While I'm sympathetic to some of your concerns, your cures are a lot worse.  I'm assuming that you are calling for these things to be implemented by force and if that's the case, count me out and count me out of any system that embraces it.  Bitcoin interests me because of the promise of minimal interference by central authority and anything that threatens that makes bitcoin less interesting to me.  
There are solutions to the problems though and that is increased competition to provide lower fees and demands by users for companies to better serve their customers.  Apple didn't become the gigantic retailer it is through government intervention.  They made better store experience and products and practically took over the world.  
Bitcoin has a lot of areas it needs improving on but those improvements are going to come from developers and companies that see a need and fill it the old fashioned way.

I'm a huge fan of the network and all the hugely transformational things that it can do but the reality is that there is already a debate going on between those that want to focus on the network capabilities and those that want to focus on bitcoins.  
The network does need miners and miners need rewards.  When somebody says that miners were doing it in the past without compensation, well that was a bunch of enthusiasts working with a much smaller blockchain.  As Bitcoin stands right now, if the value of bitcoins dropped to nothing, well without any prospect of future earnings, I think mining was pretty much be back to enthusiasts and that certainly wouldn't be enough to support a viable blockchain for commercial applications.
In any case, 99% of the people on these threads are most interested in price.  And 100% of the drama I'm complaining about is about price.

@_date: 2014-11-15 09:40:59
And this is another great example of how btc enthusiasts are the worst thing for bitcoin.  I've been in bitcoin for a bit over two years now and while I love the technology and the promise of the future, I'm less and less interested in being part of any bitcoin community.  So many people involved are just unpleasant to interact with.  
I still believe in the tech, people can't convince me otherwise, but man, some of the people are just...odd.  
Maybe this in the end with be the best thing for bitcoin.  If it can survive this current period we are in, where so many people behave like jackasses and demand new users step up their game rather than the technology be improved for the masses, then maybe it can survive anything.

First thing to know is that a whole lot of the comments are by people who live for drama and freak out at every opportunity.  Panic is what they live for.  Conspiracy Theories abound.  
And incompetence reigns at Mt. Gox.  It was the dominant exchange in bitcoin for years but has managed to singlehandedly create havoc in the btc world on multiple occasions because of the utter failure to operate professionally or respond to problems in any sort of logical manner.  Their demise has been inevitable and a price drop would naturally accompany it.  But people some people in bitcoin have to FREAK OUT even though any logical thinking person saw this coming.

I'm beginning to think that as William Goldman said about the movie business, "Nobody knows anything." as far at the future of the price of bitcoin.  There are so many working parts and unexpected reactions to each action that so far I've found nobody who's really had much of a track record in predicting it.  The smarter ones seem to be those that don't even try.  
Sure, if every human being on the planet bought $10 worth of bitcoin, the price would go up.  Way up.  But each of these incremental developments sort of create results that nobody really anticipates.

This is an issue I've long wondered about so I'll be following to see if a decent solution is found.  The problem I think is that there is no solution that doesn't either have the retailer holding onto btc or the buyer accepting that once they spend btc, it is gone forever and they have to accept reimbursements in fiat.  
And as mentioned there are lots of opportunities for bad actors on both sides to play the system for their own gain.  How many times would Amazon go through such a situation before they'd throw their hands up, say "screw it" and walk away from bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:05:11
Wow, people here seem to think a suggestion or option is all or nothing.  An employer can make bitcoin an option.  they can offer a percentage chosen by the employee.  It can be a great option for people who want to get bitcoin without the hassle of exchanges etc.  
While discussing these issues it's important to think creatively and about how to offer options that people will want.  If my employer offered me such an option I would jump at getting at least 10% in bitcoin.  It would be a great savings option and a way to be able to easily have bitcoin on hand to spend when I want.

I've been involved with bitcoin for a couple of years but more and more I really want little to nothing to do with the community because… there are so many dicks.  
I've never been involved in anything where people are as judgmental and absolutely heartless when commenting on anybody's mistake.  almost always it is decided that whatever happened was the user's fault because…math.  
This is a technology that is constantly ridiculed and condemned and the people who claim to have the greatest interest in seeing it succeed seem to do everything to achieve the opposite.  
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:05:36
The thing is, nobody is going to trust anybody in this environment.  That includes bitsoftrust.com.  Not commenting on that site because I don't know who they are or how trustful they are.  
Some industry leaders need to understand how important something like this is and either throw their support behind the above site or get something better going.  Thank god that Gox is gone but the community needs to come out of this stronger and able to ensure that similar debacles don't happen again.  
Nobody with any common sense would have directed anybody to MtGox in the past 6 months.  That kind of commonly known information should be very well known to anybody who dips their toes into bitcoin.  
BTW, bitsoftrust.com still has mtgox listed as "not yet ranked".  I don't think I'll put my trust in that site.

It does nothing of the sort.  There's no implication except the clear one that an antagonistic approach is self defeating.  You don't have to embrace and welcome a central authority to have a civil discussion with authority.  
If you want to ensure that every effort will be made to slow or stop the development of bitcoin then pick a fight with everybody.  
This is not just ill advised and counter productive, it's immature and amateurish.

No they don't.  This isn't the politburo.  There are plenty of examples that anybody with common sense and maybe a day of time on this and other subreddits can easily see.  Your response is exactly what people are talking about.  You can't even bring yourself to comprehend that anything like this is taking place even though there are plenty of people who are invested in bitcoin saying it repeatedly.  
Look, I'm sorry that some of you dumped a whole bunch of money in bitcoin when it was at $1,200 with dreams of mansions, yachts and private islands.  That was probably not the best move.  But bouncing off the walls will do nothing to help you get whole again.  It will probably be years before bitcoin is ready for the general public and you'll just have to put your champagne room dreams on hold until then.  
As for myself, I really want to see bitcoin develop and become mainstream.  I believe in the technology.  But I think those that are most critical of the failures of the developers (and boy have they been failing) have to come from the proponents of btc.  We have to demand the highest standards long before we expect or push for mainstreaming.

@_date: 2014-04-14 12:47:09
Of course it doesn't but the goal, at least the goal that I understood when I got involved with bitcoin over a year ago, is to take it mainstream.  Companies involved in bitcoin have enjoyed an outpouring of acceptance for subpar service, even incompetence and criminality, with bitcoin users making excuses and allowances because they want to see bitcoin grow.  But it is having an opposite effect.  
Every single time yet another scam artist absconds with a few thousand bitcoins or a few million dollars or whatever, it sets back the adoption of bitcoin days, months, probably years. We all know that our protections are limited to zero as thing stand today so we should be even more vigilant in policing the companies in the community.  And demanding that they prove they're legit before they get a single satoshi from anybody.

Wanting more freedom from government interference or regulation in no way requires anybody to lose their basic humanity or concern for others.  I have no interest in my elderly mother having to fend for herself in a world of parasites and others who see her as an easy mark.  And frankly I don't want to live in a world where my mother has to constantly be on guard for every jackass that crosses her path.  
And I don't want a world like that for anybody.  
And in the current state of the bitcoin community, I don't want her involved in any way.  Because not only are there way too many creeps out there trying everything they can to steal money from those who may be naive or careless or maybe not very bright, there are others who some how think that its a dog eat dog bitcoin world and if you get ripped off, the fault lies absolutely with you.  I have no interest in a world like that.
Human decency, compassion and honesty are traits that are valued by most people for a reason.  
Bitcoin enthusiasts that demonstrate no appreciation for those common values do nothing for bitcoin and pretty much demonstrate their total lack of understanding of humanity.

Yes, people should take responsibility when using bitcoin but that line is getting old really fast and if things continue as they have been, with people losing large amounts of money because they didn't get a computer and printer that have never touched the internet and blah, blah, blah create paper wallets and blah, blah, blah, then bitcoin will never be adopted by much more than a bunch of computer nerds.

I think Andreas has a troubling habit of making bold pronouncements that are backed more by his instinct than evidence but your criticism here is not only unwarranted but deceptive.  Andreas has been very vocal in his criticism of Gox for a while now.

I feel this way more every day.  Every time somebody talks about the "philosophy" of bitcoin I want to throw up.  Every time somebody blames some "idiot" for having all their bitcoins stolen, I know we are years away from bitcoin ever becoming mainstream.  Every time somebody tries to lay out their super duper method for predicting the future value of bitcoin, I know they are either delusional or lying.  
I was always turned off by the ads I'd hear on the radio for buying gold. Just the style of the ads gave the impression that they were mainly targeting the survivalist living in a cabin in Idaho.  I certainly don't think gold is exclusive to those people but those people are just as certainly very passionate about their gold.  And bitcoin is getting that same image.  I hope it does finally develop to the point that normal people can and want to use it.  As of now most of them are creeped out by bitcoin just from those that are most promoting it.

you totally screwed up your joke by using the very word you're suggesting as the rhyme.  In fact it was so poorly done that it doesn't even work as a joke.  A better version would be "It starts with P and rhymes with Fonzi." or even better, give your audience credit and totally drop the "it starts with P" and go with "It rhymes with Fonzi." and now everybody makes that extra step themselves and it's a little funnier.  
Maybe you can work on your delivery for a while and drop back into one of these threads and see how it goes over.  But in the end it doesn't really work at all because the punchline is so cliched and overused that it'll probably result in more eye rolling than laughs.

For the people who keep insisting that bitcoin will succeed purely on the basis of being superior, try looking up betamax and how that worked out for them.  
Short version, beta beat VHS in every category.  Every single feature in Beta was superior to VHS and so everybody expected for beta to become the dominant format.  EXCEPT, vhs recorded longer and Sony was tighter about licensing.  And so VHS stomped beta because no matter the superior stats on beta's side, people wanted VHS.  
The best thing about google wallet (and I think it could be huge) is that hopefully it will be enough of an incentive to get bitcoin entrepreneurs to step up their game and get out of this creative and technological slump.

Yeah, after reading more here, I think as things are now, the only option is to very clearly state that bitcoin is a one way method of payment and any refunds will be in fiat at the value paid, the end full stop.  Any other scenario is simply unworkable at this time.  
You could provide refunds in btc for the customer's convenience but still follow the guidelines above.  
I think at this moment in time, bitcoin users have to accept that once they spend btc, they are necessarily entering the world of fiat and any further dealings will be with that.

Discounts are great and should be expected if for nothing else but to realize the savings the store gets over credit cards.  But the best way to get people to use bitcoin is to create a system that is hyper secure, hyper convenient and hyper easy.  
It needs to be practically as easy as reaching into your pocket and pulling out cash.  
I just realized the other day that if I die, my family will not have access to my bitcoin located with one company.  They would either have to have my computer or phone and I live in a different country.  
But it's secure.  Yep, it's secure and I guess it'll stay there forever.  
The bitcoin world is very experimental at this point with many real world problems that have to be solved.  I think solving every one of these is a lot more important right now than convincing people to use btc.  
@_date: 2014-09-21 01:38:01
but when people talk about buying bitcoin, they are always talking about the units.  The confusion is very easy to understand as demonstrated by how many times people say "Bitcoin and bitcoins are different things...".

I'm a bit fan of Andreas but he's been going off a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  He's spoken before about the ideology of bitcoin and frankly if bitcoin is an ideology then my interest plummets.  It's math.  
This latest outburst is equally disturbing.  Bitcoin is going to be mainstream only when it becomes interesting and valuable to the mainstream.  There may be a lot of people at these conferences preaching to the choir about what they're going to do but they aren't going to do much until bitcoin is developed further and that's going to involve a lot of the people Andreas is dismissing today.  And bitcoin's usefulness is going to be accompanied by a more stable price, whatever it is.  people are not going to trust their life savings in something that can lose 50% overnight.  
That is the kind of thing Andreas sees as liberating for those in countries such as Argentina.  
So while I still think of him as one of the smartest guys in the community, I think his passion gets the best of him sometimes.

I've been in bitcoin for over a year now and frankly I've become bored by the conversation here.  There's a lot of self generated drama that reminds me of pre-teens looking to give meaning to their lives.  Most people grow out of that phase and I just don't need any more of that kind of silliness.  
I'm also bored by those that seem to have lodged their political philosophy into bitcoin as if bitcoin is political.  As soon as bitcoin requires a loyalty oath, I'll cash out and wait for a real alternative to come along.  
The reality, despite what some really smart people say, is that being belligerent with talk of tearing down the system will only create difficulties in the adoption of bitcoin.  And for those that continue to insist that bitcoin is unstoppable, well that's just delusional.  A single company with less than a $1 billion in btc hammered the reputation and viability of bitcoin by doing very little more than stealing or losing the coins.  Imagine what a coordinated government effort with 10 times or more in funds could accomplish.

I've never been to the other forum and probably never will because as I see it, the btc community has a lot of people that don't do a very good job of communicating.  My interest in the conversation if pretty low so although I am still subscribed, I only check in periodically and rarely comment.

I'm not accusing them of this, but I stopped listening to Let's Talk Bitcoin when I got tired of what appeared to be uncritical coverage of anybody willing to give them interviews.  That's how I heard a dominatrix talk about how she accepts bitcoin but actually she's never actually accepted bitcoin but she sure would if somebody ever offered it to her.  
Several pieces followed the same pattern of having a guest who was basically getting free publicity without actually doing anything or really being challenged in their assertions.  
But then, as much as I believe in the tech, I've gotten burned out by the constant reports of scams and schemes in the bitcoin space.  It's exhausting after a while.
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:00:04
I think there's a lot of impatience in the btc world with many of us wanting bitcoin to be used in ways that it simply isn't yet ready.  It's cool to see various stop gap measures to make it possible to spend bitcoin but most that are for broad use are actually some sort of convoluted process that converts btc in some way between the buyer and seller.  The benefits of a fully mature bitcoin transaction of the future are not being realized today.  
Security is horrible with people terrified they're going to somehow miss a critical stage and lose everything and then be called stupid by everybody else.
Wallets have a long way to go.  
Plus the interface is not really ready for mainstream usage.  To me it is all still in a proof of concept stage and people need to relax, be more patient and let it develop naturally.  
I say this as somebody who has gotten plenty anxious over what I thought was the too-slow growth of bitcoin until I decided I needed to chill a little.

Actually there is a very simple answer to why btc was trading higher, you couldn't get your fiat out for weeks, sometimes months without paying a 5% fee.  Prices were higher because nobody would want to sell on Gox except for that premium.  
I don't mean to be insulting but your knowledge of Mt. Gox is very limited if you're not aware of that situation.  You should probably try to do some research on Gox a bit.  If you're really interested then there is a lot to learn.

I've been involved in btc for about 4 years.  I'm not a tech guy but was excited about the possibilities of the technology.  I was excited about the concept of currency free of central control but even more about the application of the blockchain for various uses.
Since then I've watched the community be roiled by scandal after scandal, claims that btc has a particular philosophy and just a whole lot of immature sniping.  If you haven't witnessed the same thing then you're not paying attention.
You can assert whatever motivations to me that you like and that's fine because that doesn't matter.  
I like though your explanation that this is a situation where experts are arguing over what direction to take for the future.  The promise of bitcoin was that we wouldn't be subject to the whims of a select few.  That's exactly what is happening.  How is that any better than the feds making similar decisions.
But most striking about your comment is how beautifully it illustrates how every conversation seems to go here.  Very few seem to know how to discuss or debate the issues but instead attack others for motivations they have no way of actually know to be true.  Thanks for making my point better than i ever could myself.

While sympathetic to the arguments, they're not very effective when thinking about your personal future.  Who's going to go to the trouble to find somebody who will sell real estate for bitcoin?  I think we all have to accept the very real risks that are going to continue, along with volatility, as long as btc is of such limited use in the real world.  
I'm a believer but it's not there yet and has a long way to go.

"Requires a criminal conviction before forfeiture of property. Police can still take your property if they suspect it’s tied to criminal activity, but if you’re not convicted of a crime they have to give it back."
State agencies need to pay a fee for money they have to return in order to make them think twice about confiscation.  If they risk a 10% or so hit Everytime they wrongly take property, confiscation will plummet.

It would certainly be nice to look at this case objectively without investigators making money off it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:15:55
I'm not saying he's innocent.  I'm saying the case is so tainted that it should be retried to ensure the evidence and case weren't corrupted in the process by clearly corrupted investigators.

Why not use r/bch or create another sub?  The only reason to use r/btc is to sow confusion.  I don't care how many times Roger Ver or anybody else proclaims that bch is the real bitcoin, i's unethical to run a sub with a name that does not reflect the actual content. And it taints everything on the sub.

I never supported him during the trial because of the charges.  But since his conviction we've learned that more that one agent embezzled btc during the investigation.  They had every reason to fix the case.  That is a glaring red flag that should at least warrant a retrial.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:00:17
I wasn't a defender of his during the trial after hearing the charges of murder-for-hire but when you find out the investigators were embezzling (wasn't another agent also charged), there's no way to think the investigation was legitimate.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:41:47
Ah, missed that.  Still, it seems like a federal agent should get a lot more punishment for such a crime.   AND, Ulbricht should at least get a retrial!
@_date: 2019-02-15 17:10:32
I unsubscribed because it is nothing but a bch promoting, btc trashing circle jerk.  I'm fine with legit criticism of btc and I do my share but r/btc is filled with people who genuinely want btc to fail and do everything they can to make that happen.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:52:19
Ross Ulbricht sits in prison with a life sentence because of this tainted investigation and this guy gets 2 years?  Ulbricht's sentence should have been thrown out.  I've been scratching my head about the thinking in that case.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:35:49
we don't, or shouldn't, send people to prison for life because it was "more likely".  Whether Ulbricht is innocent or guilty, the system suffered a failure egregious enough to warrant another trial.  If you are convinced he is guilty, you should want another trial because his conviction should not be so shaky.
@_date: 2016-02-15 22:22:10
Exactly this.  The btc community seems to be filled with people who imagine a world where people will flock to a technology that demands they invest a lot more of their time and attention than the vast majority of people ever will.  
As long as this opinion continues, btc will never go anywhere.
@_date: 2017-04-26 12:08:32
I don't understand this.  When I use purse, I pay btc into escrow and then another person purchases my item on Amazon. After I receive the item, purse releases my btc to the other person.  I don't buy anything directly from Amazon.
One thing I've noticed that gives me pause about purse is that the ppl doing the purchasing from Amazon are not just ordering an item and having it shipped to me.  Instead they have it shipped to themselves first and then ship to me.  I don't understand the logic of this and that is one reason I'm hesitating from using purse anymore.  There seems to be something skeezy going on and I don't want to have any problems arise because I used a service that was doing something illicit. 
So when you say the cards were purchased directly from Amazon and Amazon shipped out fake cards, that simply doesn't sound logical.  If Amazon was shipping fake cards that would be a huge problem for them.  They would be subject to criminal charges.  
It just seems more likely that somebody in the chain between you and Amazon introduced the fake cards.  Purse returning your money kind of confirms that to me.  
Maybe I'm missing something here.
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:43:46
I was toying with the idea of using gyft but didn't like their terms.  This makes it clear though that I won't use them.  Clearly they're trafficking something less than legitimate.

I just recently bought something that arrived in packaging NOT from Amazon and without the info Amazon provides for gifts.  It certainly isn't the way I want to do it and as I said, I'm not planning to use purse anymore because of this.  I did receive the item I ordered though so I'm not sure how I could be doing anything wrong.  
Btw, this has happened at least two times to me.  It wasn't until the second package that I started feeling bothered by it.

I understand the issue being addressed here but does this have any effect on any btc currently held?  Sorry for the ignorance.
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:51:33
not to defend amazon but if you buy gift cards that are not legit, that isn't amazon's problem.  You may have paid for a card but that apparently doesn't mean you paid for a real one.
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:47:58
I've used purse a few times and always got my items but for some reason the items are reshipped to me instead of directly.  This means shipping takes twice as long.  There's something sketchy about it because they also don't include the info that you need for returns so you have to go back to them and request it etc.  It just feels like there's something sketchy going on and I'm paying legit btc so I don't want to get caught in some illegal activity.
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:01:36
Exactly.  Why do ANYTHING that could create confusion if you believe in your product.  Creating confusion seems to be what you do when you have no faith in the value of what you're doing.

@_date: 2019-01-18 14:59:40
That's fair and I can understand the point.  But if your sub is dedicated to discussing bch then it should be r/bch, not r/btc.  It's very simple.  Just because you think r/bitcoin behaved badly doesn't mean you can mislead other people.  
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:44:12
Also, I'm just appalled that they took over the r/btc sub.  I go on these subs so rarely that I'm not familiar with all the accusations of censorship etc but the fact is that anybody going to that sub is looking for conversation about btc, not bch.  To hijack that sub and pretend that it somehow belongs to you and bch is incredibly obnoxious.
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:20:08
Argue all you want about what is the "one true bitcoin" but bch is not btc.  It's as simple as that.

This is what has been driving me crazy since the split.  I ended up with both so I want both to succeed but it seems that the bch people are determined to wage a scorched earth campaign to burn everything down.

Sorry you had to go through this but honestly, the btc community is filled with immature jerks.  I got involved 6 or so years ago and was really enthusiastic about the technology but once I started reading Reddit threads I realized I don't want to hang out with these people.  
The ongoing battle over BTC and Bitcoin cash is a perfect example.  People have lost their minds over a technology. Whatever works will work.  Stop wasting your breath and time over trashing the competition. 
The absolute worst thing about Bitcoin is the crowd that has gathered around it.  Normal people are repulsed by this behavior.
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:47:32
This is why I never understood why people advertise their bitcoin on license plates etc.  That's how you end up being tortured in your living room.

@_date: 2017-05-23 23:48:57
An important point to remember in all this is how corrupted the FBI agents involved became.  I forget how many but 3 or 4 turned out to have stolen millions in bitcoin.  His conviction was obtained through the work of very dirty agents.  
I never defended the guy because murder is about as bad as you can get, but after learning about all the embezzlement involved, I can't believe he's not out of prison.  If nothing else, he should get another trial. 
To be clear, there are plenty of reasons to doubt the truth of the charges.  The agents had every reason to railroad him and the government needs to prove they didn't.
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:00:15
I was very skeptical about btc when first introduced to it a few years ago.  Now I am skeptical for different reasons having more to do with the volatile personalities involved in it. 
But the answers to your questions about source of value etc are all out there and have probably been provided to you already by the links provided.  
The interesting thing for me in trying to understand bitcoin was learning more about what sort of real intrinsic value fiat money has or something like gold.  that's the big eye opener.
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:45:05
As long as btc advocates keep making lame arguments like this, the technology will remain little more than a great idea.
Had a friend lose 50 btc because of a stupid mistake.  You can easily argue it was his fault, but it would be a lot harder for him to accidently lose $40k.  Btc apps etc need to make it just as difficult to lose btc as dollars.  
Enough with excuses.
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:19:48
If you think normal ppl are going to bother with btc education or reading forums then you have a extreme expectation of normal ppl.  
As long as this remains the case, btc remains a curiosity for 99.9% of the planet.

I take predictions with a grain of salt because nobody knows anything about the future but I hope you're correct. Having said that, hodling has been good to me.  I have a friend that sold out at $1,200 and still considers himself a wiser bitcoin investor than me.
My greatest concern for bitcoin is community surrounding it and its penchant for infighting and shooting itself it the foot on a regular basis.  That does more to damage its reputation and hinder its acceptance than anything.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:58:22
I say stupid because whenever I mention this example to people in a btc thread, they always jump to the stupid part.  Of course that isn't what's important.  Btc has to work for everybody, not just hobbyists and programmers.

Stupid mistake.  He wanted to log into coinbase and did Google search for coinbase.  Clicked on first choice and went to fake site.

Again, the answer always defaults to user error.  I don't know of any other product in history with so many problems that were dismissed as a result of user error.

Im not sure but think when he input his user name and password, they were inputting the same data into the real site.  That triggered the code and when they asked for it, he input it and they transferred that.  
He had 2Fa on and they beat it pretty easily.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:35:49
Another example of why bitcoin is far from ready for the mainstream.  Never has there been a technology where potential users were told they were too stupid to use it.  
"Oh, but the stupid ones can have it explained to them." Yeah, and they can put their money in banks and use credit cards.  Without being insulted.  
The incompetence of btc developers in mainstreaming this is amazing.  Here we are at unprecedented highs and nobody knows how to provide easy-to-understand-answers for legitimate questions.

In early March I bought my first bitcoin for $32.  Right now, after this dramatic drop, it is only worth $305.  The long  month recovery you talk about left me with only about a 900% increase.  Excuse me while I go cry in my coffee.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:56:05
INteresting you use this example because from the piece about Mercedes it says...
*Karl and Bertha Benz
German engineer Karl Benz (1844–1929) studied Otto's work and determined to do better. After building a simpler gasoline engine of his own, he fixed it to a three-wheeled carriage and made the world's first practical gas-powered car in 1885. No-one took much notice—until Benz's feisty wife Bertha and their two young sons "borrowed" the car one day without asking and set off for a 100-km (65-mile) journey to see grandma. They bought fuel at drug stores (chemist's shops), because gas stations had yet to be invented, and the boys had to get out every so often to push the car up hills. Bertha even had to stop a couple of times to make repairs with her hair pin and garter belt. News of this intrepid early test-drive caught the public's imagination; Benz couldn't have dreamed up a better publicity stunt if he'd tried. He took his wife's advice and added gears for uphill driving. Soon he was developing successful four-wheel cars and, by the start of the 20th century, was the world's leading car maker.*
So basically the guy's wife and kids headed out on a distant trip without any tech support or mechanic to fall back on.  Just her hairpins.  Let's see btc be that intuitive and i'll be happy.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:28:22
Kudos to you for being involved in and committing to the technology.  Sure, a lot of people are getting in just for promises of riches and I'd be lying if I said I'm not looking forward to the next upswing, but I think most have no idea what the potential of this technology is.  And for those that would berate you for making your own choices based on your own decisions, well I'm sure their words aren't bothering you at all.  You're doing well.

Have a friend who introduced me to bitcoin.  He's a tech guy and has been deeply involved for several year.  And a nice guy in general.  But once I became interested and bought a few (after much pushing by him), he responded to my various questions and comments as if I'm a complete idiot.  He dragged me into this party and then seems offended that I'm here.  
I get the same impression from some bitcoin people on Reddit.  They furiously promote bitcoin (because of course it has to go mainstream to be successful) but are disgusted by the unwashed masses when they finally get on board.  
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:03:01
That sounds like a personal problem.
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:29:34
You are correct about the difficulty of btc right now for average users and that has to be corrected very soon.  Hopefully some new apps etc will come online that really makes things a lot more user friendly.
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:08:16
Agreed.  There is a tendency for people in the bitcoin community to scoff at and ridicule people who make what to them appear to be stupid mistakes.  That's fine for when you're hanging out with your bitcoin buddies or whatever but if you actually have any hope of bitcoin going mainstream then you better hope it becomes user friendly for everybody.  Until that moment arrives it will remain a curiosity of no use to the majority of people in the world.  
The growing mantra I see is that bitcoin is for the other 6 1/2 billion.  Well, the other 6 1/2 billion will never put their wealth at risk as bitcoin exists today.  
I'm a big believer in the technology but there is a huge gap that exists today that stops it from actually becoming truly functional.  Here's hoping 2014 changes all of that.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:56:40
Thats a common reaction in the btc community, blame the user.  When it happened, my immediate question was about 2fa because I thought it protected you.  Turns out no, it gives a false sense of security.  
My friend knows he made a dumb mistake.  He accepted it.  But he'll never touch btc again because it's too risky for him.  
Btc people can say whatever they want but these are the kinds of stories that scare the mainstream away.  If you truly want btc to be viable, btc has to appeal to the mainstream.  No amount of ridicule etc will do it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:15:08
Seems to me that a lot of people are so dedicated to their preconceptions of what bitcoin is that they refuse to consider what bitcoin is becoming.  I don't think any of us can predict that.  What I mean is that I think bitcoin will go through many permutations over the years before finally settling on its final form.  
My fear over the past few weeks has been that btc was getting ahead of itself with so many buyers pushing the price up before it becomes actually useful to everyday people.  I'm a big believer in the technology but it's just not there yet.  So we had all these people who, without really taking the time to understand it, bought in with dreams of riches.  And of course the rising price reinforced that belief.  So a lot of holders were involved without any awareness or really care about the underlying technology and when the price started slipping, they bailed because the one thing they cared about was no longer there.  
Of course I'm bummed about the price fall just because it made it more fun to look at the total value of my little collection but I'm holding because I really do believe in the future functionality and value.  
Anyway, I really hope that a lot of the new improvements that are needed will come online soon so that when the next wave of new interest hits (soon I think), there will be a lot more security options and capability to trade for goods available as well.
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:54:12
What's hilarious is that I'm into bitcoin and I post a tiny fraction of things about it while you apparently do nothing but post about bitcoin.  What's the obsession with something you have such anger towards?  Did an angel of the lord appear to you and say to go on Reddit and downvote?
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:55:14
Glad to see this and hope his change of mind is the start of a wave.  I read, talked about and debated bitcoin for about 4 months before I finally bought my first one so I understand the difficulty to comprehend the concept.  I'm going to cut him slack now that he seems to have softened his view.
@_date: 2013-11-02 10:01:52
I think this is an important next step for btc for all of the reasons already stated.  We need to be able to easily reference fractions of btc in terms that make sense for our typical usage.  If I were to buy a hamburger at a place where they take btc, I want the guy to tell me I owe 25 milibits vs. .025 btc.  The whole decimal issue is a huge problem anyway.  And as mentioned, this will probably have to be altered as the value rises to accommodate such changes.

I don't understand the concept of removing the UDS from the picture.  Every currency is valued according to other currencies.  That's how they work.  There may be some philosophical reason to want to move beyond this but it isn't practical and I can't imagine it will every happen.  Anything of value will always have that value expressed in terms of currencies.

Trying to wrap my head around what you guys are doing.  I've heard about you in the past but hadn't really checked it out.  
This might sound like a dumb question, but is there going to be an independent testing of your product by leaders in the community to give their yay or nay?   I'm not a coder and get befuddled when people start talking about the blockchain etc. but there are people I listen to regularly and respect.  
In order to turn over my btc to a new company, I really want to have some sort of confidence that outsiders have evaluated and passed Dark Wallet (or anything in this field).  Is there any plan to provide such assurances?

@_date: 2013-12-12 00:47:52
Yeah, I think a lot of the believers are so devoted to "to the moon!" that they ignore the current limitations.  I'm really hoping that the current influx of VC will result in a lot of meetings with something like "Um, we really don't believe things will happen because we wish it to be true.  We need to make this as simple as using a credit card and twice as secure.  That's the first step."
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:09:46

I have that app and the first day was showing it to a friend.  While sort of walking through it, I wanted to simulate how to buy a bitcoin and accidentally did.  I was totally taken aback because there was no sort of second confirmation screen.  So, if you have it and also have little kids, don't leave it signed in with them around or you may end up with a big surprise.  
Luckily it was at $200 so I'm up but still didn't like that.
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:44:47
I think that's true.  A lot of speculators have no faith in the future of bitcoin and so panic sell when it dips and then decide to get back in after it regains its value.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:30:40
As I read this, basically they are saying that bitcoin can be traded but not used for purchasing items.  Am I reading that correctly?
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:04:16
That would be a disaster.  The next day, the price of a bitcoin crashes and then people want to reestablish that name to a bitcoin again.  Just determine names and stick with them.

Name them.  They're trying to play both angles.  Enjoy the convenience and savings of bitcoin but without any risk.  Total BS.  Nobody would side with them in such a dispute.  It's their responsibility to vigilantly convert to fiat asap if that is their goal.  
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:32:13
This is why I think that wallet security is the  issue with bitcoin at the moment.  Forget vendors accepting it as payment.  Until people can feel comfortable with having a substantial amount of funds sitting in bitcoin, it will never go mainstream.  
I got into btc because of a tech friend who managed to explain it enough to cause me to research more.  But when we talked about creating paper wallets etc., he always just left my head spinning.  Because he is deeply involved in technology, he couldn't understand why all of the many steps involved were in any way complicated or daunting for the average person.  It's a huge issue and needs to be addressed asap.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:24:33
That's the way to do it.  people that try to proselytize have the opposite of the intended effect.  They just annoy people for various reasons.  But if you present it in a way that involves future value that doesn't require any brainpower, then it's similar to giving stocks of a company you think will be huge one day.   
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:55:15
I only look at prices of what I can get today and mtgox stopped being a part of that equation a long time ago.  Actually I never liked them for various reasons but I don't understand why anybody would consider theirs a legitimate measure of the worth of their bitcoin.

The only thing I can say with certainty about the subject has been said before by somebody else "Nobody knows anything."  There's going to be a price point I think where people will cash in if not all, then certainly portions of their holdings.  That will recirculate btcs and possibly cause further dips in price.  
I just think if you have a guy living on a goat farm with 1,000 btc he diligently mined over the years, he's going to be thinking that once btc hits $1,000, he's a millionaire and BAM! he's out.  Others will have other math that will be their moment to bail.  
This isn't a criticism of btc and more of a guess than anything but I have a feeling a lot of people who've been involved with BTC since the beginning are not necessarily the most wealthy or sophisticated when it comes to finances, and when they feel like they can retire, that'll be enough.  And so BTC will eventually end up with people that are a bit more wiley about how they hold and use them.  
Like I said, this is all conjecture but isn't that how things work out with gold and precious stones?  They're mined and sold by laborers for a pittance of what their ultimate value actually is.
Open to push back on this idea.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:36:30
A more specific news thread would be of interest to me.  Like something that focused on analysis or developments coming down the pipeline.  How bitcoin developers are creating apps etc that make it more user friendly etc.  The news about the price, which seems to dominate, is fun but not really informative about bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:49:05
Thailand didn't ban bitcoin.  A board basically said they needed to look into it more following a presentation by a bitcoin company trying to set up in Thailand.  The headline about banning was wrong and repeated all over the world.  There is not a law in Thailand making bitcoin illegal.

I think what is going to emerge in the end for normal btc users will be a 3rd party service that provides some sort of secure wallet holding service that allows you to access and remove funds as you like with something very much like a credit card.  The fee will be nominal and your funds will be divided into different wallets to minimize the loss in the case of a stolen wallet etc.  
There's a good chance that some people will take on all these security precautions but I think they will be very, very rare.  This is where good old capitalism steps in.

That's exactly what I am finding.  A lot of people I know who have bought in couldn't tell you much beyond the percentage of returns over the past 6 months.  They really know next to nothing about it.

Had a conversation with an FBI agent who said he was involved in the SR case.  He was very clear that he didn't consider BTC as anything improper.  I was relieved to see that.

Isn't it awesome that a ragtag band of rebels has the technology to build a time machine and comes up with a way to murder billions across the planet, but somehow can't figure out how to make btc holders spend their wealth on stuff?

This seems to be an incomplete story.  If the money was stolen then how was it placed in your account?  How was it tracked?  This doesn't seem to be an issue to do with bitcoin but with stolen fiat.  
I recently heard about a guy who ended up with stolen bills after doing a deal on localbitcoins.com.  Seems there are some kinks that need to be worked out.

Understand about it not having much use as a currency at the current time but the price has dropped because people perceive its value as less than they did a month ago when its use as a currency was even less.
I see BTC as a long term investment based on my belief in the technology and its place in the future.  I don't really watch the prices very much anymore as I've taken this long term approach but I am always curious about where it is at and the reasons behind it.

I get the idea and all but there is a very simple reason for a coin image and that is to make it understandable for the general public.  I think if you put this image in front of 90% of people and tried to explain how it better illustrated the network of bitcoin etc, their eyes would glaze over and they'd lose interest in a couple of minutes.  
The challenge for bitcoin, beyond security etc, it to be made understandable to everybody from a child to an 80 year old who's never turned on a computer.  At least that what I think if anybody hopes for it to ever become mainstream.  Most people don't give a damn about the technical issues and just want to use it for what it's supposed to be there for.  
To steal from Steve Jobs, the goal of bitcoin development needs to be to be able to say "It just works."

The interface and security isn't there.  It will take time.  One of the big problems in my mind is the belief by people who live, eat and breath bitcoin, that people who don't understand exactly all the steps needed to secure their coins etc are idiots.  That's not only untrue, it's a potentially fatal (to the protocol's future) misconception.  
People can argue about whether bitcoin is a currency or store of value or whatever but right now it is a product.  And it is a product that has to appeal to the public, not the other way around.  Nobody is sitting around hoping for some technology to come along and make their life more difficult.  Unfortunately bitcoin, as it currently exists, does.  Bitcoin has to become what people want and it isn't that yet.  
Better apps, better wallets, better integration.

You can walk into walmart and a gazillion other stores today and buy a burner for a lot less including a month of unlimited calls.  All anonymously.  Why would anybody want to pay this price for the same thing?

This is exactly on point.  Every time I go home, I have to "fix" my mother's TV/DVD/VHS setup.  Yes, she still uses VHS.  
Anyway, she gets befuddled by the connections etc on a regular basis so I know before I get there that I'll be dealing with it in some way.  But she can spend money or use a credit card like a champ.  
So until bitcoin is as simple to use as fiat or credit cards, the failure is in bitcoin.  People need to accept that and work to improve it rather than calling others idiots for not understanding something normal people have to study for hours to comprehend.

I had a friend in the 90s who became a day trader and made a lot of money, basically quitting her job and deciding that she would do that the rest of her life.  She was so good at it that there was no reason to work.  
Then the bubble popped and she found out that it wasn't her brilliance but the market.  Anybody could make money in that market.  But she couldn't anymore.   Cold slap in her face.

I've been down on MTGox since before the big runup a few months ago.  The current situation only confirms my suspicion that it's being run by a bunch of bozos.

Yes, when that day comes, it will be a great one.  But that day is probably long into the future.  There is nothing out there at this point that is user friendly for a typical consumer.  There is nothing that is as straight forward and intuitive as Amazon etc.  I had a friend miss a decimal point and basically send 10 times more than intended.  Decimals can be devastating.

I've never had a problem with coinbase but then I get the impression that a lot of people involved in bitcoin are just waiting for the NEXT AWESOME/AWFUL THING.  It's like there's never just something of concern that maybe should be dealt with.  It's always EXTREMELY EMERGENCYEEE!

In spite of what many here say, security is the biggest problem with bitcoin at this moment.  The very nature of it makes it more vulnerable and if we want to see it go mainstream, it's going to have to secured so easily that your grandmother could do it.  
I'm not a tech guy but I'm really surprised that nobody has come out with a solution to this growing problem.  The higher the value rises, the more thieves are motivated to steal.  One too many high profile thefts and nobody's going to want to deal with them.

The phrase used over and over by people I respect in the bitcoin community is "Only invest what you can afford to lose."  That is said over and over again.  But for a lot of people, that's been lost.  
Somebody buys one bitcoin at $100, it rises to $1,000, they suddenly think they're a brilliant investor and decide to go all in and they tell their friends and family to put everything they have in bitcoin.  The price crashes and they get angry at bitcoin.  
So once again "Only invest what you can afford to lose."  That shouldn't be hard to remember.

We should all be doing the same to many different websites to encourage them to accept bitcoins.  It will increase their international reach and help in the continuing acceptance of the currency.

Hi Guys,
I am living outside my country and it is not convenient to make payments in the manner you have set up. When you start accepting bit coins then that will change.
Good luck.

This is how some long timers come across: 
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:12:33
If I am reading this correctly, bitcoin can still be used to buy products in China but the recent announcement squashed the growing excitement there about bitcoin and made it less interesting for people in China to use.  So although people can still do certain things with it, the momentum was lost and most simply don't want to.  
Is that a fair reading?

When I got into bitcoin, the common phrase everybody used was something like "Only invest as much as you can afford to lose."  That's what I did.  
Now I keep reading about people that are putting their entire life savings in or something equivalent and as the price rises, they are seen as brilliant.  And when it crashes people act like it's all a big surprise.  
But the reality is that bitcoin is still in its infancy and people still need to keep in mind the reality that this can all crash down at any moment.  
Having said that, a little over a month ago, btc was worth less than $200.  people that are screaming disaster now are delusional.  We've enjoyed a tremendous rise even with this crash.  
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:58:45
I think one issue that is sort of glossed over and seriously needs to be addressed is the fact that btc is still in beta.  There are many issues involving usability, gui, security etc. that hopefully will be addressed by 3rd parties or the bitcoin development team.  But until that time comes, I don't see it as becoming mainstream, even if it was adopted by ever retailer in the world.  I'm a big believer in the technology but I think a lot of people don't realize that it still has a long way to go.

jeez, on friday some friends and I went out for drinks to celebrate passing 300. Today it sounds like its the end of the world because it crashed and right now I read it at 303.  We have a long, long ways to fall before we are even close to being behind.  I was waiting for a crash but if this is it then thank god.
