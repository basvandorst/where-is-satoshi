Thank you so much  :D  I was just about to ask if someone could do the math for me!  So does that mean that [one of these]( mining BitCoins could pay itself off in ~32 days (because that would be a worthwhile loan)?  That's what that dustcoin says, but it seems too good to be true

Well... I couldn't think of anything more lucrative to invest in... I've applied for literally every scholarship available for my particular college, taken out two loans to help pay for the first year, and been saving up about 90% of the money I've made since I was eleven (by dumping it all into a CD that barely pays 0.9%)  And I'm going to apply for nearly every job available (it's not very close to where I live, so I'll need a new one).  I've also purchased a bus pass and learned to like Ramen noodles.  Do you have any other ideas?

$0.88 per month?  I don't know if I'll live long enough to break even on a bank of these things  :)  Thanks for your reply  :D  Is there an alternative that you would recommend?

Dang... you'd think that a company that can literally print money would be able to invest in top of the line manufacturing.  So if I were to take out a gigantic loan (or series of loans) and order one of these, it may be two years or so before it actually arrives (and I'd be paying the loan the entire time)? I'd love to be able to order one and wait to be charged until it's ready to ship...

Wow... so the profit from bitcoin mining continually goes down exponentially? How does anyone make any money?

I have to say that BackTrack 9 has everything you could ever want  :)

Thanks for being real  :) I'll look through the site and see if I can learn anything before I get an account.  That's a lot of really good advice

Thanks fr your reply!  I'm actually living in a house which is entirely solar powered  :) It's too bad it won't work.  I wonder if it would be legal to have a bank of FPGA chips working in a dorm...

Sorry about that  :P  I thought it would be breaking news because it was on the BBC...  Good to know the devs are on top of it.  Speaking of which, how do devs work?  Doesn't their existence mean that they have the power to control and do what they wish with nearly three billion dollars in BitCoins if they wanted to?  Do they have limitless control?

That's exactly what I wanted to know and didn't want to hear  :) / :(  Thanks

Could this be done in vending-machine style?
