Still hate myself for selling at 12000, waiting for a dip -&gt; bought back at 14500 this morning...
It all happened so quick &gt;.&lt;

I also saw this article, and got worried as I have Nordea, and became afraid of never getting my wallet money back...
But then I heard about the BitPay card that VISA created! ( 
Maybe order it to your dad for christmas, then he can go shop in Netto with BTC lol 
(I'm a bitcoin noob, so don't judge...)

Have you tried Coinbase? 
Dunno if it is accessable in your country, but it works very easy and smooth.

Will it maybe begin to drop at $13K? It seemed that was what happened earlier...dropped and then rise in few mins. Maybe some bots selling at $13K milestone? Though about waiting to see if it reaches this milestone, and then look if it drops, and then strike!
