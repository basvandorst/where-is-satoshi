If guys like this are coming around on Bitcoin, I think there's a fat crash coming within a month or two

I mean, the brokers are basically the exchanges. All these investors keep gambling with different coins, and the exchanges are making a fortune skimming the fees. They don't care if investors cash out, make money, lose money, anything. They just want transaction fees.
Some people will win and some people will lose in the crypto game, but exchanges are the safest earners right now. Miners too I suppose
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:02:56
Yeah Bitcoin prides itself on being immune to attack, blah blah blah
If one big exchange wants to jam up the entire currency, it can. And it can profit through mining/alts in the meantime. And if this story gets big, Coinbase insiders could move all their alts to BTC and then unclog the transactions.
Decentralization is difficult
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:14:18
For Bitcoin maybe. Other crypto is still really useful for black market deals. And as far as mass media is concerned, Bitcoin is all crypto and all crypto is bitcoin

@_date: 2018-01-09 18:07:35
A cryptocoin's title is basically first come first serve. Bitcoin cash has a lot in common with Bitcoin and it might be Bitcoin in description but it can't be Bitcoin in title, because that's already taken

If the government doesn't like cryptocurrency, it is very easy to slap the terrorist label on it. Just make a fake report that ISIS uses crypto to secretly move money around, and now it's a tool of the enemy or some shit.
I'm surprised the mainstream media isn't slamming crypto for being widely used in illegal drug deals. The fact that they aren't suggests to me that the government or at least rich people love bitcoin because they're making tons of money on it
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:06:24
Eventually could be a long ways away. there's a lot of inertia keeping Coinbase popular, and there's tons of insider gain to be had if they want in the short term

This is a legitimate fear, I could see the US government making its own centralized network to exchange crypto, and then they could tax/regulate/monitor all transactions on their network.
They'll label all non-regulated crypto exchanges "black market" and associate it with drugs/crime, and then you've covered "think of the children" and "anti-terror", so they can crack down on non-centralized currency
It's not that much of a stretch

what's the deal with @_date: 2017-12-07 23:50:53
Bitcoin can theoretically overtake any/all currencies, by virtue of decentralization, international stability, privacy, and convenience. There is value to that. I don't believe that in 1000 years the world still has a hundred different currencies, look what Europe has done with the Euro. Bitcoin can be the world's Euro

Both this subreddit and are so childish and petty. If you believe in one over the other, speak with your wallet and shut up already. Bashing on each other both ways just makes everyone seem so insecure about their money, like they desperately need to tear the other one down because they're so threatened by it.
BTC is the OG, but fees are shit right now. Maybe they'll fix it, maybe they won't.
BCH is a BTC ripoff, but if it avoids the shitty fees then it's a lot more usable.
There's merit to both, but to denounce one another so fervently just looks weak
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:34:57
If BCH isn't a ripoff of BTC, why are they so insistent on co-opting the name Bitcoin? It's cute to say it's in the spirit of Bitcoin's original vision, but it's obviously a marketing ploy. And good on Roger I guess, but it's slimy
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:56:02
The trouble is, when Bitcoin is seeking widespread awareness/adoption, these exchange's problems become Bitcoin's problems, because you can't expect the general public to do 30 minutes of blockchain research. You're lucky if someone reads past the headline. Exchange security might as well be Bitcoin security at a glance, that's all I mean.

Why can't you compare them? They're both unorthodox, speculative assets that saw unlikely and astronomical growth. 
The tulips turned out to be a historic bubble, and Bitcoin has the potential to be the same. Regardless of what hype you believe here, Bitcoin is not a sure thing. It has seen a lot of success but there are a dozen scenarios in which the floor falls out and all the "Tulip" naysayers can be proven right
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:47:51
I mean, what about Mt Gox, what about NiceHash?
When it comes to asset value, confidence/trust is extremely important. The vast majority of people have confidence/trust in banking. How many people are going to trust Bitcoin the same way when they can't fully understand it and online exchanges have proven vulnerable?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:29:20
Idk if that's feasible, plus if it's already gained enough traction they have far more to gain by just taxing it
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:45:04
Your massive bias is showing, and your wall of text just confirms what the above poster said about desperation and fear. If you really thought BCH was no threat at all, you wouldn't speak on it at all. It has merit, it has its place in the marketplace, and time will tell if it has staying power.
That said, Roger Ver is a cockroach

Yo so I'm finally hopping aboard this bitcoin train right?
Signed up for coinbase yesterday, but it won't let me buy any bitcoins. 
Questions: Am I restricted because of the fork?
Did I fuck up buying right after the fork instead of before it?
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:48:33
It's a speculative gamble. 
Worst case: It goes to zero, this could easily happen any day for several reasons (nations outlaw it for some reason, a security flaw is discovered)
Best case: It's sophisticated design and early popularity make it the true global currency of the future, and the bitcoin really has no ceiling in terms of potential.
Past results are not indicative of future performance, but Bitcoin has been a hell of a ride. Feel free to gamble with us, but I wouldn't go all-in
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:46:24
Lol he didn't mean a speculative investment, he meant guaranteed small interest rate growth over years.
How is this relevant to Bitcoin at all?
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:17:23
They're marketing it as a global exchange, so they want to show foreigners

People speculate that Bitcoin may be the future of global currency (mainly due to its sophisticated design), and with it's limited supply, it could someday be tremendously valuable to have even 1 bitcoin. 
Many are skeptical, and of course there's risk involved, but it's been a huge success over the past several years
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:12:20
You probably spend a lot more time learning Bitcoin instead, based on your post history
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:02:18
First off I believe in bitcoin and think it's reasonable to see it at a massive future value. Now that that's out of the way:
I think it's dangerous to call Bitcoin an investment, as it's not true in a financial sense. Buying a home that you plan to rent out is an investment, in that there's guaranteed value and return.
Because bitcoin has no intrinsic value, no dividends, no guaranteed returns, it's just a currency. People say they "invest" in currency but the proper term is speculation. Buying 1000 Pesos and holding them for years isn't investing, it's speculating. It's gambling on a slightly more sophisticated level.
I know what people mean when they say "I'm investing in bitcoin", I'm not trying to just be pedantic. But when you say "one gains value", that's very presumptuous and misleading

The first sentence on the sidebar: "Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money."
It's a currency.

You don't sound delusional, just arrogant and self-assured about bitcoin of all things

This is not sound financial reasoning
There's a reason that the mantra exists: "past performance is not indicative of future results"

It's speculating, not investing. An investment is something with less risk and less reward. Bitcoin could bottom out tomorrow, or go to the moon. Bitcoin delivers no specific value and no guaranteed returns/dividends.
