This is not what I meant. I was trying to say that capitalist governments have financial regulations as well. And also that banks shouldn't be blamed for this. I personally believe there should be less restrictions for ordinary people.

This is a governmental regulation. Banks must follow the rules. South Korea implemented capital control as well.  Even the most libertarian countries have some kind of financial regulation.

It is NOT "insanely difficult and expensive" to move money out of China legally! All you need are 1. Tax certificates (ask your employer or get it yourself from your local tax bureau) and 2. your work contract. Take those documents to your bank and you will be able to exchange up to 100% of your legally earned RMB to a foreign currency. That's it!
You can then initiate a transfer (online or offline). Fees are not high: ~120 RMB fixed fee + max 0.1% of total amount.
Using bitcoin might be easier if you know what you are doing, but btc price in China might be higher, total fees might be higher + you risk having your bank account getting frozen (why do you think sellers ask you not to use btc keywords when initiating alipay, wechatpay or bank transfers?)
Good luck!. I hope you are legally employed and your employer pays taxes!

Copied from Wikipedia: "*2001, Schmitz bought €375,000 worth of shares of the nearly bankrupt company Letsbuyit.com (de) and subsequently announced his intention to invest €50 million in the company.[34] The announcement caused the share value of Letsbuyit.com to jump[35] and Schmitz cashed out, making a profit of €1.5 million. One commentator suggested that Schmitz may have been ignorant of the legal ramifications of what he had done, since insider trading was not made a crime in Germany until 1995,[32] and until 2002 prosecutors also had to prove the accused had criminal intent*"
