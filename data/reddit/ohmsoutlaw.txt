Sorry bro, if you don’t have the private keys it isn’t your bitcoin. Do you mind telling us how much you lost??
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:06:19
Do you want to loose clients? Because this is how you loose clients.

1. Canada is awesome
2. I’m from Canada and it was not hard to invest
3. Canada is awesome
4. Get ledger nano s. Yes it’s expensive but it is in my opinion the only way to go
5. Get out of Canada if you think it sucks
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:59:00
I’m in the same ��‍♂️ 
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:39:57
You are correct
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:26:51
Now is a good time. Fees are really low!
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:21:41
Depending on how much you are sending I highly recommend buying a ledger nano s. Most likely the exchange will charge you a flat fee for sending the transaction but for future transactions you can look up the recommended satoshis per byte here. Https:\\bitcoinfees.earn.com. Also make sure you copy and paste the address you are sending to. Re-read it afterwards because you could have a virus that changes it after you paste! Re-read it a couple times! Good luck and welcome to the future!

That fee is extremely cheap compared to what they pay. I recently transferred some BTC off of their exchange and they paid nearly $750 USD to have it out on the next block. They do not make money off of this that I guarantee.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:08:22
Take a look at my previous history because I also posted on here.

NEWSFLASH!!!! Drug dealers accept USD!!! USD is directly funding drug lords!!!! Everyone must stop using it!!!!!
Sounds dumb right? They are saying the same thing. Just a stupid scare tactic for the weak minded.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:26:03
I use Kraken and sent two wire transfers 1 took 9 days and the other 10. I’d say give it a little more time. Also IMO Kraken is really good. Use the beta tool that shows current trades, it’s awesome. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:28:54
A lot of people trash Kraken, I use it and love it. Their beta tracker is awesome 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:11:03
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:29:49
This is a bad idea, to get someone else to invest money they need for retirement. You could single handedly destroy your grandparents lives
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:34:38
How much were you paid to troll us like this? Come on mods get ride of trash like this!
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:52:28
Update, If anyone actually cares lol it took Kraken about 36 hours to take the hold off. Thank you Kraken
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:44:40
I’ve sent a couple transfers to Kraken, it took at 10 days to reach my account. Give it a bit more time. I know it makes you nervous and makes you want to puke but it’ll probably show up.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:22:12
I use Kraken and would highly recommend. Also their beta is awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:31:27
Yea different but to get to that point I still had to wait.  They are probably getting bombarded with so much right now. Waiting suck but give it a week. Let me know how it turns out
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:33:40
This is the link. It’s awesome

Who is this guy and why the f would I care what he thinks?

Where are the mods? Delete these lies!!!
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:24:29
Thank you for the stats!

Just like they say never try to catch a falling knife. Wait until it hits the kitchen floor then pick it up.

.05% on binance if you use their coin for fees

Welcome to BTC, that’s exactly what I feel like right now
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:01:33
Don’t listen to this guy. I’d definitely accept btc if I was selling my house. I was just watching a realtor show based out of California and the realtor says more and more customers are asking to purchase/sell using BTC! I like some other people’s posts saying to just asking your realtor to list that you will accept BTC or other Cryptocurrencies and if you happen to get a buyer then your lawyer will know what to do. Good luck!
Might have been Florida can’t remember...

I’ve used Kracken and have only had good experiences 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:45:32
Yes agreed, she is bought and paid for by globalists 
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:31:31
Sounds like you know what you want so don’t get an advisor, just get you money on an exchange and send it to a wallet. I’d highly recommend getting a ledger nano s! I have one and it in my opinion is the best way to keep your money secure. Your bitcoin can stay on the exchange until your nano arrives. Don’t buy a nano from a sketchy source. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:16:29
If you do it this way it’s like free money because you’ll never have to pay it back!!! OP can you give some references for sharks that we can use???
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:28:08
Yea unfortunately, if I were you I’d panic sell 
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:31:02
Please tell us more...
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:50:52
“Advisors” a week ago were saying bitcoin was dropping to 1k a week ago, now it’s almost 11k usd. They have no idea what they are talking about 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:48:30
+2 but a lot less people. More like 100
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:38:43
Sounds like you need a NEO dapp
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:18:47
Don’t use an advisor, depending where you live use an exchange to get your money in. Buy btc the second it arrives in the exchange. Don’t try and time the market you will lose trying to do that. Then send your money to Binance and you can buy some alts if you’d like. I’d recommend maybe a quarter in NEO and maybe 15% in something a little more risky like Icon and keep the rest in btc. If you are planning on holding long term then send all of those to your wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:33:12
I was thinking the same thing
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:27:08
K this sounds like fun. I’m doing it in CAD feel free to take 80% of it if you want it in USD
March 15 - $14,386
April 15 - 18,951
May 15 - 15,436
But Neo by May 15 I’m guessing will be $257
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:55:47
I didn’t use them to trade a lot. Just sent my $$ then bought btc and sent it to my wallet. Went smooth other then the 10 day wait to transfer the cash but I don’t think that is their fault for the 10 day wait
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:05:10
If it’s that risky and bad, what I’d do is sell what you have in btc and borrow the rest like lprepCoins said. You might only have to come up with a couple thousand then. Running and hiding is a good way to end up tied to a chair like in bond casino royal. Nobody wants their balls whipped!
