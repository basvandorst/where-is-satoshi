And a few posts down I guess he tries to falsely accuse the customer of posting from a 2nd account by quoting the customer's post with a random user name inserted as written by instead...
Then someone else comes on and says they refreshed the thread a lot and never saw any 2nd account post and then delete.
Hmm... there's no way to know for certain, but still, LOL.
Oh wait, there's more. The user actually admits to having the sock puppet account and apologizes for it, but it's unclear whether or not he actually means it, as he is required to say those exact things in order to keep his pre-order intact and not refunded.
