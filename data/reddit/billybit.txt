Don't say you'll give him half a bitcoin, say you will give him $200's worth of bitcoin otherwise he'll be banging on your door if the price skyrockets.

What you denote the value of something in has nothing to do with value, it is to do with familiarity with the measure. A dollar is an arbitrary measuring stick of value (as is a bitcoin), but it is an arbitrary measure whose value people are familiar with, i.e they know how many eggs a dollar buys.
In Kyrgyzstan, eggs are priced in Som, not because they are more valuable than dollars, but because they are a more familiar measure of value for the people that live there.

Also bitcoin is opt-in and can be easily cloned. No one is going to "opt-in" to a system that restricts them when they can just use a clone that is 1/100th of the cost. Then users move across to the clone as it has less friction and the "settlement network" dies anyway (because it's value is not decreed like fiat but derived from consensus, i.e it no longer is agreed upon as the de facto crypto for payments and therefore no longer any good as a storage of wealth).

The mining network is only as large as it is because of the monetary incentive of the block reward. The block reward is only an incentive because of the price of bitcoin which is caused by large demand (relative to other cryptos) from the user base. Make transactions expensive, holders and more importantly people speculating on the future growth of bitcoin jump ship and the price plummets, killing incentive to mine, switching off miners, destroying the only reason (security) to use bitcoin over any other crypto.
The network effect of bitcoin is only currently strong because from the end users perspective it is comparing like with like. I can use bitcoin or I can use litecoin, they are essentially the same, so there is no reason to use the smaller network (less connectivity) over the larger. Any one familiar with game theory will know this as the strategy "use Litecoin", being strongly dominated by the strategy "use Bitcoin". If Bitcoin becomes expensive this is no longer true, people will have a legitimate reason to quickly and easily (aided by the natural frictionless property of cryptos) move to another cryptocurrency that does everything they need, but for 1/100 of the cost.

If bitcoin is to be successful in the future it will have to increase in value in order to meet the demand of the increased user base. Having a bitcoin is like having a share in the bitcoin network. If you think it's going to be successful, you should be stockpiling bitcoin.

Personally I prefer the electrum method, not necessarily for multi-sig but just because of the ease of use you get with a "reusable" seed. It's more like a password that a layman is used to understanding the significance of keeping secret. Spending from the cold wallet, change addresses etc the HD wallet is a lot more intuitive to use as a novice compared to sweeping paper wallets. Just make sure they understand the concept of cold vs hot wallets
