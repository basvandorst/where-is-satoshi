This is not a stock market.

That wasn't the question :)

If you paid 1 btc, you should get 1 btc back, not the dollar value of it.

So Walmart can start hoarding all the bitcoin too? Nah

Yes, but you apparently do not.

If you live in constant fear and regret, you likely have poor risk management skills.

What are you talking about? This happens way often when money gets transferred into the wrong bank accounts / bankers make clerical errors. It could even happen in person if you were to accidentally give somebody a 5 dollar bill instead of a 1 dollar bill.

Fair point.

That is kinda the point of bitcoin though. It is a decentralized currency that is unforgiving. I myself lost thousands of coins because they were worth pennies at the time and I formatted my drive without giving it a second thought. I have no one to blame but myself in a situation like that.

Lets face it, a not insignificant number of people would have kept the coins. Applauding good morals isn't a thing to dismiss.

No. Don't twist my response to fit your narrative. Try again.

You can't just skip the laws of thermodynamics and gravity like that either

HAHA OH MY GOD YOU BETTER SELL THAT STUFF NOW
