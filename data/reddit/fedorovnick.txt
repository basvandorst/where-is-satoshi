@_date: 2019-08-09 17:36:14

@_date: 2019-08-16 19:23:04
first half of next year
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:26:04
dude don’t sell..it will go back up that’s how investing in the market is
@_date: 2019-10-04 04:45:56
I hope to wake up to BTC down around 6k so I can buy a bunch more coin
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:13:16
no cus BTC was really hoping crypto takes off and it would have mooned if Libra made it, but it’s getting a bit delayed
@_date: 2019-08-23 04:51:39
I think we wake up tmrw and BTC gonna be 10.6
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:28:36
How low y’all think bitcoin gonna drop? I have about $950 to spend
@_date: 2019-10-12 14:55:53
If say buy small amounts at a time....or if bitcoin is down a lot in one day maybe buy a good chunk but it’s really up to u
@_date: 2019-08-09 17:26:44
It feels bitcoin has been stuck at 11.700 for a week now
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:22:57
it’s just one piece of news dude....it’s not gonna double off this
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:16:11
Lol I like how mark cuban was trashing bitcoin a couple weeks ago and today announced they are the second team in the NBA to now accept bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:08:07
Yikes apparently ppl giving up hope on libra, not too good for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:22:33
Wooo this gonna jump bitcoin to 12k
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:47:48
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:28:17
just keep buying the dip if you have money to spend...it’s gonna be worth it
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:19:48
honestly tho what just happened?
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:19:13
I started selling my BTC at 10.55 today and bought again at 10.41....not bad made a little extra profit in the long haul
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:39:19
I’ve bought about 2 percent more of bitcoin since this flash crash....every dip o try to buy up a bit more
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:50:02
Yes I get that but I’m investing in bitcoin with cash...so if I sell my bitcoin investment I’m left with just cash
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:49:19
Cus I have robinhood and I’m putting cash into bitcoin...so if I cash out then I’m left with cash not bitcoin, get what I’m saying?? Cash cud be obsolete in the future but if I invest with cash I’ll be left with cash
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:27:42
Will the launch of bakkt tmrw help bitcoin go higher in price?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:13:54
Buy the dip ppl...it’ll help u get richer in the long run
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:57:53
So how do I actually buy bitcoin without cash?
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:46:27
Why we tanking?
