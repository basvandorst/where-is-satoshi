Since nobody wanted to reply, I guess I will. The majority of major billionaires in the world don't have their value in liquidity, but instead in company ownership, stocks, options, and broad portfolios and/or real estate. Jeff Bezos, for example, doesn't have $100B+ liquidity, but *could* have it if he wanted to by selling his massive positions. This is why you see such fluctuation in their values.
Let's use Jeff as an example, though. I'm sure he has a security team, but let's say you could kidnap him. You can force him to give you some cash, but he probably has it distributed across many avenues. You can force him to sell his stock, but how does that help you?
Satoshi, on the other hand, isn't nearly as rich as Jeff Bezos, but has BTC in a form deemed readily liquid, and which can be distributed to you directly through a series of hot/cold wallets and you can disappear relatively quickly, albeit it would be a complex process to do so completely with the volume. Comparatively, good luck somehow benefiting off of multi-bil in stock sales versus multi-bil in cold storage crypto.
Let's compare it to someone else, who at one point in time, was the 7th richest person in the world: Pablo Escobar. He had quite a bit in liquidity, as we all know. And he was hunted like a dog in his later life and his organization was shattered. I'm sure Satoshi can't amass a security team like Pablo Escobar, which didn't even end up saving him.
TLDR: Liquid cash or crypto is much easier to yank and get away with than someone who owns billions only in stock positions.
