In this case, you 'burn' them by sending them on purpose to a completely invalid address that no-one can use.   
The more common way is simply losing the private key to a wallet, while the coins still exist, no-one can use them and they are 'lost'.  
These include most, if not all, of the coins attributed to Satoshi himself - if it doesn't, *someone* has access to roughly 1,1 million bitcoins (a theoretical worth of $23 billion at the recent ATH) and could at any moment flood the market and completely devalue bitcoin.

What would be a suitable shortening for that though?   
Maybe BitCHcoin, BCH?

No.  
I don't know how long it takes (two weeks comes to mind?) but eventually, it either goes through or gets returned. How your wallet software handles the return differs though, with some you need to force a resync.

Right, I got misled by the first having "Unable to decode output address 0 BTC 1111111111111111111114oLvT2"

It's worse than no backup as you do stupid shit like swap HDDs and resize partitions trusting nothing can go wrong...

Had to fit the lipsync on the dubbing.  
"it's over nine thousand" is almost like three words. "It's over eight thousand" needs the space or it sounds more like "it's over a thousand".

Not really, but you should make sure [those tubular pin tumbler locks are very good quality before deployment.](
