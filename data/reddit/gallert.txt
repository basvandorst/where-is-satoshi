Since this turns up when you try to find out whether mcxNow is trustworthy, i guess some comment should clarify:
* **OP has lost Bitcoins himself** due to buying assets when they were valued very high and selling them when they were traded very low. Had he kept them and recently sold them he would have Increased his BTC net by about 25%.
* There were some currency pairs disabled for quite some time, most of which have been resumed by now, one new beeing added. Required updates and security considerations are a **valid reason to change the exchange pair roster at any time**, and one should keep in mind that deposit and withdraw was never paused for more than small maintenance windows, unlike what mtGOX is doing at the time i wrote this - they keep the trading enabled and disable withdraw.
* mcxFEE are not shares in any company, its an indivisible internal currency guaranteeing you a fixed (0.001%) share of fee incomes of the exchange. **mcxFEE did exactly what they were avertised as all the time**, not a single payout is missing, there is no reason to believe the fixed ratio hasnt been met apart from obvious precision loss due to payouts paid in currencys supporting 8 digits max.
* RealSolid is receiving his own share of the fees in the very same manner his users are - meaning **all users can see how much exactly RealSolid is is profiting** from the exchange.
* **RealSolid has no personal interest in "noobs"** (people unfamiliar with technical details of cryptocurrencies or people unwilling to research before buying things and then complain) trading on his platform (he expressed this multiple times in potentially offensive manner)
* **RealSolid has** (as opposed to OP reporting) **bought back considerable amounts of mcxFEEs** after pausing many currrency pairs (reducing the income generated from these).
 * OP is blaming the wrong guy for his losses
 * mcxNow has never outright scammed people
 * mcxNow is a platform for intelligent and experienced traders only
 * mcxNow redistributed generated income highly transparently
 * research before buying anything
 * so not sell anything reacting panicked to things you would have foreseen if doing the first
 * distribute your money amongst potentially untrusted parties
