I do my very best :-)
- in 1995 the newsweek published an article about how the internet will fail, because no webshop will replace a sales-man without any personal interaction, no cd-rom &amp; no book will be replaced, and no online databse can replace a newspaper
- today, all these things happened and we're using the internet every single minute in our lives by looking in our smartphones
- bitcoin has been called dead over 300 times because of several 'problems' like scaling, but hey, it's still alive :-)
- nobody can ban bitcoin from a country, you can only ban your country from bitcoin (quote from Andreas Antonopolous)
- some people think bitcoin won't stay because we're used to have one single currency for a country, but this could be a paradigm shift and maybe in a few years there are many different cryptocurrencies next to euro, dollar yen...
- so why don't let people decide to use their favourite currency in different situations? -&gt; power to the people
- yes the internet took a long time to be here today, but this could also happen to bitcoin and it could be a greater chance than a it will be a thread
- it could change the world to be a better place, so let's work on it for a more fair future...

thanks for your answer! does monero offer only multisig transactions or is there a possibility to use a monero multisig wallet where let's say 3 or more parties can use one wallet without any trust issues?

„The open and transparent nature of the Bitcoin blockchain makes it possible for states to mark certain bitcoins as being “tainted” by their use in proscribed activities. Although Bitcoin’s censorship resistance at the protocol level allows these bitcoins to be transmitted, if regulations were to appear that banned the use of such tainted bitcoins by exchanges or merchants, they could become largely worthless. Bitcoin would then lose one of the critical properties of a monetary good: fungibility.
To ameliorate Bitcoin’s fungibility, improvements will need to be made at the protocol level to improve the privacy of transactions. While there are new developments in this regard, pioneered in digital currencies such as Monero and Zcash, there are major technological tradeoffs to be made between the efficiency and complexity of Bitcoin and its privacy. It remains an open question whether privacy-enhancing features can be added to Bitcoin in a way that doesn’t compromise its usefulness as money in other ways.“

Before that happens, I will buy all coins at 1$, and I guess I am not alone with that plan ��
