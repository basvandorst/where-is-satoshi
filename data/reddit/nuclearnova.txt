Unfortunately the USPS was quoting me $58 for a flat rate international box, 12 pounds is quite expensive and I don't know of any other options :(

While this is great I still like racking up airline miles for my deposits. Now are they planning on letting us withdraw funds in BTC, because that would certainly be better than having some strange Canadian corporation fedex me a check that my bank charges me extra to deposit along with waiting several weeks for it to clear

I'm from Meadville, PA, south of Erie 30 minutes. Here is what I found -

Thanks for the tip, I've made sure to tape the caps pretty good and the 3-4 packages I shipped last month came in alright. I'd be afraid of glass breaking, but I guess if it's packed right it should be fine. Thanks for the post about the dark stuff, I agree completely and so do my local customers!

Maple sap is 97-99% water so we do not sell it, though if you buy syrup and water it down it's almost back to the sap state

Yah for real, I mean seriously fuck people with different opinions than us, if we want to preach to the choir let us do it in peace!
@_date: 2014-04-26 14:13:24
Awesome, I've visited VT and NH several times and I love that area, it would be amazing to have a maple farm there
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:13:12
Thats what I ending up doing and everything has been flawless since getting a plastic card

EDIT: Coffee definitely didn't kick in yet this morning when I made this comment, I mixed up Gyft with eGifter in my morning stupor. While I have used Gyft in the past and have had a smooth experience with them, my comment on the CEO of sending me a personalized message with a 9x points code because I bought several thousand dollars of certificates with them was actually eGifter, which I can 100% recommend!
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:35:38
Thanks for letting me know, I will try to fix that tonight!

Made in NW Pennsylvania I forgot to mention

Hello everyone, long time lurker first time poster. I am the maker of this syrup, feel free to ask me any questions you may have!
@_date: 2014-04-26 03:49:09
Unfortunately I don't think I can ship internationally, I've tried several quotes and everything is way more than the value of the syrup, sorry!
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:01:24
Post says shipping included to USA only, I don't think its practical to send it to Europe unfortunately :(

I'm using Coinbase so I have the option to convert it to USD right away and get direct deposits for a small fee, but as someone who already has a collection of bitcoins I'm just adding them to my collection and hoping they go up in value over the long term
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:17:04
Thanks but I get an error clicking the link - The requested URL /biz/4909/ was not found on this server.
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:03:56
Wow the internet is a small place isn't it Tim! Hopefully I'll be up there next month, I'm actually figuring out a date to visit tomorrow when I see some of my old roommates. EDIT : I guess you didn't just randomly stumble into this since I linked to it on Facebook haha
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:25:41
Correct, you can set it up to be a fixed amount in bitcoin as an option too
@_date: 2016-03-02 00:38:42
Awesome, definitely getting one of these
@_date: 2016-03-02 00:39:42
Yes I agree
@_date: 2015-07-11 13:46:45
Yah thats what I got him actually, the HD version. He had a little trouble getting it working, I almost recommended Coinbase instead but I'm not up to date with security and didn't want to recommend him something stored online in case it was hacked/lost/bankrupted

If you're ever in northwest PA let me know, I love to give tours, though right now things are a bit of a mess since I haven't had enough time to organize
@_date: 2016-02-14 14:56:00
First USPS batch going out tomorrow, I'm having lots of fun right now trying to print labels (usps website is acting up, two other sites are too confusing, and stamps.com put a hold on my account to verify my usage on the first dozen labels!)
@_date: 2016-02-13 19:41:21
They redid the grading system this year, now grade B has been replaced with grade a amber / grade a dark, so this is a little lighter than what you're use to but not the golden grade
@_date: 2016-02-14 23:28:11
Still haven't got a fully functional store page yet, check the blog post here for Coinbase links - 
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:18:59
Thanks, my first changetip!
@_date: 2016-02-13 19:42:03
The bottom two links should work. Sorry unfortunately its uneconomical to ship to canada, but fortunately you do have lots of other good sources up there!
@_date: 2016-02-14 14:54:23
I definitely want to get a variety, but with this new equipment it's actually harder to make dark syrup! I'll see what I can do once the sap runs again, probably next weekend. I have to say this amber batch has a really good maple flavor (though what producer wouldn't say good things about their syrup haha)
@_date: 2015-07-11 13:45:40
Just steel, up in Northwest PA
@_date: 2016-02-26 23:09:06
Update in case anyone doesn't have Bitcoin but would like an Amazon link, here they are. Thanks again!
@_date: 2016-02-13 19:43:01
Sorry unfortunately its uneconomical to ship to canada, but fortunately you do have lots of other good sources up there. If that was you that send payment from Toronto I'll refund the order tonight or see if I can find and alternate way to get it up there, I haven't checked international shipping in two years so maybe it's changed
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:42:31
Shipment  Ready to go, we ran out of mailing supplies before syrup but already have more on order! Thanks everyone for the support!
@_date: 2015-03-23 11:32:27
Looking into it as we speak, thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-23 11:35:30
As an engineer I totally agree with you, but last year I sold some 750ml and 100ml containers and they didn't go nearly as fast as the imperial sizes, which everyone uses around here. I love all of the untapped markets for Maple, when I visited Brazil last year nobody had any clue what it was and it made great gifts.
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:28:23
Hey guys I tried posting this here last year and it worked out great, and I want to thank the bitcoin community for your support. It's great being able to combine two of my favorite hobbies! Feel free to ask any questions, or check out the previous year's comments - 
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:43:34
Yes but shipping isn't included, and Quebec is the maple capital of the world with their own OPEC of syrup!
@_date: 2015-03-22 23:07:29
Thanks, I'm sure you'll love it. I'll have it out tomorrow morning, I have a decent stockpile built up now so the first set of orders should ship the next day.
