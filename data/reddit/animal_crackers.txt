It's a little early to do something so drastic.  This is just a misunderstanding.  This kid's 12-14, he needs to tell his parents what happened, all of them need to have a meeting and this thing will get sorted out.

You're the man

Dude..I'm speechless.  Thank you.

Another fine piece of content from the Circle marketing team.

You're right, banks are planting schills in our nation's middle schools.  It's the perfect conspiracy.  
Are you retarded?

Trying to discredit someone onby calling them a skeptical thinker?  First rule of marketing: Know your audience.

How jaded are you?  The principal isn't some evil corporate banking illuminati member living to fuck over kids, they just thought the money was obtained in a way that's against school policy. All he needs to do is tell his parents, or even just another teacher.  
Go to the police?  All they'd do is set up a meeting between the parents and the principal.  This wouldn't be some frontpage story.

Biggest concern I would say is regulation.  The government could end this whole thing tomorrow if they wanted to.

No, I think you wrote it...as part of a general marketing effort by Circle to spread FUD about the competition.

Will do, thanks BashCo.

I'll take one.  If you're offering.

Well, email came out in 1972, and wasn't prevalent until the 1990's.  The future in 20 years is clearer than it is in 10 or 5, it's hard to say what the timing is on huge macro shifts like this.
