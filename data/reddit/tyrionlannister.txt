If everyone corrected other people's spelling errors when they found them, the quality of internet communication would be monumentally improved.
Just throwing that one out there while we're proselytizing...

That doesn't even make sense.

I don't post much, but I've been on reddit for over 7 years.    To date, I've collected 149 link karma and 2,641 comment karma, which isn't much at all.  
I doubt I'll be posting any original or new content soon, but if I did, would I be allowed?

You guys might be the monkey on someone else's back, but I'm standing on their shoulders.

Not so awesome, really.  He's only giving it back if the guy can find him on reddit.  Because fuck 'em.

Here's the direct quote:


I can see how the extremely long run-on sentence could lead to confusion.  However, he is making multiple statements here.  The advice he took was not credited to anyone specifically.  It could be the aforementioned 'relevant authorities', or it could be his cat.

That sounds like a better investment.  Link?

*Bitcoin* is the main sponsor?  That's like saying "Today's event is sponsored by trees."
Bitcoin is a thing, an object, not a company.

I don't understand what you're worried about.  You don't have a bitcoin client installed on your computer?  Or you believe your computer is compromised and therefore don't want to generate a private key on it?  Or maybe you're worried about being unable to securely delete the private key from your hard drive in a way that makes it unrecoverable in the future by malevolent actors?
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:54:25
Nothing against you, since I don't know you, and I am sorry, but it has to be asked:  Did *you* take the coins?  
This could all be a smokescreen to show your clueless noob friend that you're doing everything possible to figure out what happened.

How is this response optimistic?
Sure, it uses positive phrases, but it pretty much boils down to "I've forwarded this to some other department, don't expect to hear back".

I found them to be very quick in processing the domestic wire transfer.  I initiated the wire transfer at maybe 9:45am and my itBit account was credited a little after 1pm.  The withholding does kind of suck, but I guess they are protecting themselves somewhat..
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:43:45
Yeah, seriously, why be realistic?  You're opening a bitcoin center after all..
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:10:22
Except that they didn't build it.  They opened an office, put out some advertisements, and solicited capital.  The products they were planning to offer were never released.

Cool, someone likes my charts :)  
It's still a work in progress, and that's still hosted on my dev box, but I figured I'd make it visible while I worked on it.

I brought it back up with functionality for BTC-TC while I work on getting the other exchanges online :)
@_date: 2013-02-21 16:50:27
What do you guys think of BTCJam?  I'm kind of new there, but I went through most of the verification stuff.  I wonder if they'd let us link reddit accounts to it at some point...  
@_date: 2013-02-24 15:07:18
The requirement of identity is for a bank transfer...  this is required in order to do business with a bank.  It's part of what stops identity thieves from just requesting data from a bank by randomly choosing account numbers to pull the money out of.  
No exchange will pull from a bank account without verifying identity.  If you need great anonymity, you should look at alternative options for buying your bitcoins --  BitInstant (though they ask for your name and phone number on the website, the phone is not called and not all of the Moneygram locations where you provide funds will ask for id, so you could lie..  not recommended), the bitcointalk forums, the bitcoin-otc channel...  You can use a local service to buy bitcoins for cash as well, if there is someone near you selling them.

Hey! It should be back up soon. I'm migrating to host it on amazon instead of on a dev server, so it should run a bit better and update more regularly. It might take a couple of days.
@_date: 2013-05-29 21:25:15
Thanks for the referral, I'm glad you like them.
The site is still in the early stage, so there should be some improvements coming.  I hadn't even meant to launch it so early, but people liked the charts..

It's a P2P lending site for bitcoin.  I just put this up to confirm my reddit account to my investors.

I would like to see this, too, except for the fact that I've already bought Minecraft.
Rather than just telling our favorite online shopkeepers to accept bitcoin, I think maybe we should do some research ourselves into payment processors which accept bitcoin and provide them with a detailed list with the pros and cons. 
We could create the list as a reddit discussion thread and link to that thread to show ourselves as their fans and bitcoin proponents rather than agents of the payment processors who are attempting to get their business.
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:02:47
That makes sense.  I wish there was a way to hold people more accountable for their investments, such as linking to other accounts.  For example, before I mentioned linking a reddit account.  I like my reddit account and would associate my identity here.  
I like that they added the Bitcoin OTC there, which helps to show previous ratings, but I don't think it is working since it seems to fail every time I try to add my OTC account..

If you take a look at the [MPEX charts]( too, you'll see that more than 1/8th of the volume for the month was traded in the 24 hours before the announcement.

You could try bitinstant.com and pay locally with cash.   You could use btcquick.com with a credit card (hopefully they are in stock and will last for a while..  they're the only place that accepts credit cards due to the high risk of chargebacks involved),  or if you have a SecondLife account you could convert your SLL to BTC at [VirWoX](

By the way, I changed the domain to coinflow.co, though fnords will still work.
