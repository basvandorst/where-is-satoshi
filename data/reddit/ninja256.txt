Is anyone working on a decentralized operating system for everyday use? I think we need an operating system that is open and based as much as possible on decentralized solutions that fall back to centralized solutions in order to bridge the gap.
Such an OS would resolve Namecoin and DNS addresses out of the box. 
This is not the same as an open source operating system based on centralized systems that can be customized by the user to use decentralized systems. 
Sure it would take a while to catch on, but I bet there are a few in this community that would use such an OS.

Thanks gary_rowe. Now that I've taken a deeper look at coloured coins and I think I understand how they work in concept it seems very close to what I'm looking for, except for one thing. It looks like I would need to know how many coins of a certain color I want to create upfront. Is this true?
I'm looking for a way to track total points contributed to a project as well as individual contributors totals. The total points for a project goes up as individuals contribute.
For example a project could start with a single contributor.
Peter contributes 1,000 points to ProjectX
ProjectX total points 1,000
If ProjectX receives a 1BTC donation, Peter gets it all.
Paul joins the project.
Paul contributes 500 points to ProjectX
ProjectX total points 1,500
If ProjectX now receives a 1BTC donation, Paul gets 0.33333333 and Peter gets 0.66666667.
This is fair, because after Paul's contribution, Peter's contribution makes up a smaller percentage of the total contributions.
As you can see, I don't want a fixed number of points. There might be a way to do this with coloured coins, but I don't see it.

Care to explain? My feeling is that it will get more resilient over time. Bitcoin is a network of people more than a network of machines. Decentralized decision making by a network of people is what makes this so resilient.
The Internet is a good example of many people keeping a system running. I think it becomes less and less likely for the Internet to turn off or to be turned off as time goes on, because the people have more to gain from it staying on. I would also argue that the Internet is far more resilient than anything that's ever been maintained by a central authority.

I agree. It's a reflection of most people's ignorance about the monetary system.
I just had a conversation last night about Bitcoin with someone who's never heard of it. Their first question was, "So, do you just buy it with real money?"
The next question was, "Can I turn it back into real money after it goes up?"
This was followed by a long conversation about how the current system works so we could have a foundation for a discussion about Bitcoin. I think most Bitcoin newcomers need a bit of foundation before they can be expected to understand. Maybe [Khan Academy]( is a good starting point.

Bitcoin has a carbon footprint because like every other piece of tech on the planet it requires energy and our sources of energy today aren't ideal. I do love how Bitcoin provides an incredible increasing economic incentive to find cheaper and cheaper (read more and more abundant) sources of power. I think it could significantly drive advancements in solar and other abundant sources of power.
Other examples of huge computing platforms with significant carbon footprints:
Google says that it emits 1.5m tonnes of carbon annually but claims that its data centres consume 50% less energy than the industry average.

I think we will see more and more merchants accepting bitcoins. I also believe that Bitcoin will be as disruptive as the Internet or more, but it won't replace fiat, not soon anyway. The Internet has definitely marginalized libraries, snail mail, fax machines, newspapers, bookstores, and more, but hasn't replaced them.

What if one looked at the costs divided by market cap? Anyway... I could be wrong, but I think we will see energy costs for mining diminish with the primary cost of mining becoming capital expenditure on hardware.

There are sooooo many holes in this.
Before suggesting Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme a short visit to Wikipedia might be what people are forgetting to do.


Bitcoin isn't a fraudulent investment, but an effective store of value that can't be debased, with a built-in mechanism for transferring any amount of this wealth to any other person or institution and almost zero cost instantly. 


Earnings within the system are paid to miners for securing the network (today miners share a total reward of 25 BTC every 10 minutes or so). In addition, miners may be paid a fee tied to a specific transaction as an incentive to include it. Typically less than 0.005 BTC. There are also zero commitments to make payments to any investors. **So no, the system is not destined to collapse.**


I haven't seen this with Bitcoin. Gavin Andresen, lead developer of the Bitcoin project, did have this to say: [Gavin: Only invest time/money into Bitcoin you can afford to lose.](
I could go on...

I'm very excited about this project. Congrats! I think good hardware wallets remove a significant barrier to adoption. 
Are you using entropy from thermal noise in the chip to seed a PRNG or generating all bits from the TRNG? How many bits / second is the TRNG? Have you tested it with something such as the [NIST RNG toolkit]( Is there a way for someone to get such a stream out of the Titan so they can verify should they decide to purchase?
I'd pay $100-$300 for a good hardware wallet that is:
1. reliable
2. has excellent TRNG
3. easy to use
4. able to display PKeys for manual import into wallet
5. nice form factor (V1 doesn't have to be small)

Is there a way to add to the protocol a way to include a miners fee in a transaction that can only be accepted by miners who commit a portion to alternative energy research?

You're right, there are two forms of inflation: price inflation and monetary inflation. When the term inflation is used it often refers to price inflation.
Bitcoin's purchasing power is increasing: price deflation.
Bitcoin's supply is increasing at a decreasing rate: monetary inflation. 
One could argue that the supply isn't really inflating, due to people saving bitcoins. This isn't a bad thing, it's capital, and will be spent or invested when the return is expected to be greater than the return on savings unlike a currency who's supply is inflating and creating price inflation. Those dollars are often spent foolishly because the return just has to be less negative than what savings would yield (in terms of purchasing power).

Seems to me that adoption of Bitcoin will continue to drive prices up for quite some time. 
5 years from now 80% of the bitcoins that will ever exist will be in circulation. I doubt however that 80% of the people that will ever be interested in bitcoin will have adopted it by then. Therefore, I would expect demand to continue to outpace supply.
25 years from now 95% of the bitcoins will be in circulation. Will demand continue to outpace supply at this point?
Stablization of supply is taken care of... Perhaps what I'm struggling with is trying to wrap my head around what eventually causes demand to stablize. Does it stablize when it gets to the point where it flows around quickly enough that many many hands touch the same BTC every week/month/year? The demand for BTC cannot be directly proportional to the number of people in the economy can it? It must be proportional to the amount of money in savings and in transit. Am I close?
At the moment I'm imagining even 10-20 years from now that prices and salaries will still be dropping (in BTC terms) quickly enough to make it difficult to "know" what a loaf of bread should be going for.

I don't think it's bad that Bitcoin looks aesthetically bad. I think it's a sign of the stage we're at. 
In the early 90s the web looked like exactly the way you describe Bitcoin. The aesthetics didn't come first there either. The early days of the web and the early days of Bitcoin are similar in that it's open, and anyone can slap something together. The only barrier is understanding what it is and how it works. The earliest of early adopters "get it", but seem to be clueless about aesthetics. **It's not the aesthetics that has the current wave of adopters excited.**
However, it is a requirement for some, and we will need some aesthetically talented people to "get it" and contribute their talents. It'll happen.

I believe with Bitcoin demand is driven by two things:
* awareness - price is one of the major drivers of awareness because the media likes to write about "stocks" that are going up. Increased demand drives up price. Therefore, I believe this positive feedback loop is what will continue to drive the price up. There will be bumps however.
* It is superior to alternatives - There is a delayed response due to the time it takes to really understand this, but this drives demand -&gt; price -&gt; awareness as well.

People often think about this only in terms of the US, which is odd. If each country were to look at it globally through the eyes of game theory. 
I'm not a game theory expert by any means. If you are, chime in please. 
I'd say the first country to adopt it officially would know the price would go up and have the ability to buy in frist having a huge advantage over other countries who would adopt later. Modelling countries adoption or rejection of Bitcoin as a prisoner's dilemma seems to indicate that adopting first strictly dominates not adopting first because adopting first provides a better payoff regardless of what the other countries do.
If there are holes in this, I'd love a game theory lesson.

I get it. I see that coming too, or at least the potential for it. Sure, it's a risk I suppose, but something tells me Bitcoin represents a fundamental change that will run its course. How long it will take is anyone's guess, so I suppose time horizon is an important consideration when swapping fiat for BTC.

I usually send a small amount first, then a large amount to follow. When testing to be sure you've got the address right, nothing beats an actual transfer.

I'd say a statement was made without much thought behind it. I have a few questions:
How do you compute gains on a purchase? 
Which exchange does CRA consider authoritative? 
Capital losses ok?
If I convert Bitcoin to a virtual currency with no exchange what's the value?
If I invest BTC in a stock traded only in BTC, how do I compute gains or losses? What if I mined the BTC I invested?
Best of all... How do I compute gains on mined coins? I keep getting a divide by zero. :-)
Taxes pay for important things like health care, so I'm all game. Misappropriation of funds is a separate issue, so I'll leave that alone.
What not reform to income (payroll) and or consumption tax? It would be far easier to enforce and just as effective by narrowing the field to employers and merchants.
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:49:23
Exactly. To those unfamiliar with Bitcoin and/or the current monetary system it just seems too scary, risky, dangerous, confusing, etc. All of these emotions lead to saying no thanks. This would slow adoption, but I doubt it would do much more than that. 
This can be counteracted somewhat with positive publicity. For example Bitcoin being used to feed homeless in Pensacola, FL.
@_date: 2013-03-24 15:34:22
Easier for who though? I bet less than 90% of the people on could (or would) use a Linux LiveCD to generate a paper wallet.
I want to build something that the guy next door can use to create a cold storage wallet, scan the address with his android, hit send, and his BTC is safe.
I definitely hear you. Why would anyone trust the black box to use enough entropy? On that same note, why would anyone trust a LiveCD to use enough entropy?
One way to address this might be to have the device accept an SD Card that would allow you to download and/or verify the software on the card.

There are a few options for hardware random number generators. Unfortunately most are fairly expensive. I'm going to start by looking into using a library written for the Arduino/ATtiny85 that may be able to serve as a good source of entropy. 
The author of the library says it "uses the jitter associated with the watch dog timer and timer one on an arduino to generate truly random numbers."
See [Beta testers needed for a new library that generates true random numbers](
I plan to use [Dieharder]( (and anything else people recommend) to ensure high entropy. I will make plans, source, and large samples of random numbers available to have their randomness independently verified.

Would hardware wallets be suitable for long-term cold storage? I'd have to put a lot of trust into the hardware esp. if it's the the only means of access to that BTC.
I can definitely see value in charging a h/w wallet up with spending BTCs and carrying it with me.

Your wallet stores your private/public key pairs.
An address is just another name for the public key. This can be safely shared. For example if you want someone to send you BTC you give them this public address/key.
Your wallet balance is just the sum of all balances of all addresses it contains.
The blockchain, which as you correctly noted, is public and that is where the record of the balance of every address is stored.
You don't *add* the private key, but rather bitcoin-qt signs your transactions with it (without sharing the actual private key with anyone) allowing BTC to be transfered from that address. Think of the private key as the key that unlocks your ability to transfer the BTC out of it's corresponding public address. So anyone with access to that private key can therefore spend BTC out of that address.
The bitcoin-qt client keeps the private key hidden from your view, but it is stored in it's wallet.dat file, which you should backup. If you lose the private key(s) you lose the ability to access the BTC stored in those addresses.
When you send BTC bitcoin-qt gathers up the required amount out of any number of addresses you have access to automatically, so don't worry about consolidating them. Don't worry about the number of addresses. There is no limit to the number of addresses you can have.
A paper wallet is just a printout of a public/private key pair. People use paper wallets so that the private key is not stored on their computer. This makes it less susceptible to theft. When you want to spend out of that address you import the key.
Hope this helps. If it's still not clear. Ask more questions.

Two options exist if you want to mine Bitcoin for more that fun:
* FPGAs if you want to start today
* ASICs if you want to pre-order/cross your fingers for hardware to show up in 4+ months. I pre-ordered ASICs from BFL last June and I'm still waiting.
FPGAs and ASICs are self-contained devices that you plug into a PC with USB.
On your PC you will run mining software (BFGminer or CGminer) that can join a pool. See: 
Where to buy FPGAs:
Butterfly labs used to sell FPGAs, but no longer...
* 
* 
(I'm sure there are more)
Where to buy ASICs:
* 
* 
Figure out how profitable you're going to be:
* 
* 
Keep in mind when ASICs start shipping the difficult will go way up, so the amount of BTC you can expect to generate will go way down. How much is anyone's guess.
Pools: 
It's pretty simple to join a pool. Just create an account and configure your mining software to use the right pool and account.
Hope that helps.

Agreed. I would leave determination of the value of a contribution to a project administrator as you say. Either negotiated up front or as part of a pull request. It's an exciting area that could be a good fit for Bitcoin. It's a bit before it's time I think, but that's okay.
@_date: 2013-03-08 06:08:57
If I didn't already know what Bitcoin was this just wouldn't get my attention. I guess it depends who your target audience is. Is it those of us that already get it, or people who have no idea what Bitcoin is?
"Bitcoin is a currency, a prtosomething, and a nerd fest that... wtf is a peer to peer transaction?" click...
I get it. You get it. But our neighbours would be lost.
My suggestion would be to consider who makes up the largest part of the audience (maybe I'm wrong about who the audience is) and make it interesting to them. Maybe pull some of the copy from the individuals page to the home page, and push some of the tech stuff down into the developers page. I kind of like "Bitcoin is the simplest way to exchange money at very low cost." - It could be improved, but I think it's a good start and it will probably be more interesting to newcomers because they can more easily identify with it.
Most people I know don't know what a peer to peer whatever you said is, nor do they care. They might care about the implications of this technology, and what it can do for them. What Bitcoin has to offer is huge, but exactly how it works isn't what most will be interested in.

This doesn't answer the question about how to verify the private key. This just ensures that the public key is valid. 
I have the same question. How can I be sure that the private key on a paper wallet will allow me to spend the balance without first using the private key? I'd like the private key to remain completely offline, but still be sure it will work in 10 years when I want to access the bitcoins.

I agree. 4 cents seems reasonable for most transactions. It is high if you're moving 10 cents or less, however can't you opt to pay no transaction fee if you aren't in a rush? I may have misunderstood, but thought that transaction fees were entirely voluntary and just increased the chances of being processed sooner.

Yes. One private key for each address.
A paper wallet is more like a paper address. It's just one public/private pair. You could create a paper wallet and transfer 10, 25, 50, 100 BTC or whatever you want to that one address. You can transfer it all at once or little by little, accumulating it at that address.

I think the value in this services is in tracking relative contribution to a project in a non-reversible way and allocation revenue accordingly. Potentially also publicly or semi-publicly displaying allocation of proceeds to increase trust level between potential contributors and project owners.

I'm trying to accumulate as much BTC as I can, but not because I view it as an investment. I just expect fiat currency supply to inflate considerably and don't think it will retain its value as well as Bitcoin. I exchange fiat for BTC on one of the many exchanges. I have never turned BTC back into fiat and don't plan to. I have purchased mining hardware, magazines, vpn, and use BTC to tip others on reddit. I'm not interested in satoshi dice, silk road, tax evasion, or any of the supposed reasons everyone is so interested in Bitcoin. I'm moderately interested in Bitcoin's anonymity, but because it's none of your business, not because I wish to hide illicit activity. There are many legal, perfectly normal things in my life that are also none of your business.
I trust it because its value fluctuates based on (a predictable) supply and demand in a free market, not because a central planning authority can issue as much as it likes.
I've enjoyed learning more about money and Bitcoin and I'm looking forward to the day when I can do all online (which now includes mobile) purchases using bitcoins.

1. I'm not saying they wouldn't be pressured into providing such a list later. The gov't may perceive a benefit. But doubt this was ever part of the ASIC mining company's plans.
2. "knew"? Some speculate that the gov't is interested in such. Soem don't. Some believe they would succeed. Some don't. But nobody knows. So... do certain ASIC mining company's believe the gov't will try and succeed? Maybe. However, if they really are intelligent enough to understand Bitcoin I don't think they would would be so certain.
