Yep. Iambic pentameter.




If it were "close up the wall" it wouldn't scan properly:
or **close** up **the** &lt;-- we don't usually stress "the," so this would sound out of place.

I don't actually think it's that regrettable. This is Bitcoin's antifragility in action. Don't delude yourself-- F2Pool didn't *want* to make this change.
Bitcoin.com is trying to throw their weight around but they will eventually give in. If what they were doing was profitable, all the pools would be doing it... but it's not. Those transactions, and the fees to go with them, just get mined by another pool. That's money *they* could be making.

That's a fair argument, but I disagree. The worst thing to happen to free speech is centralisation. Steem is a platform on which free speech *flourishes*. You literally cannot be silenced.
Look at what has happened to Reddit. Reddit's own political interests have caused hundreds to be silenced here. Are most of those people arseholes? Most likely. It doesn't mean they shouldn't have a voice. Words are harmless. Censorship is unforgivable.
On Steem you always have a voice. If people don't like what you say they are free to flag you, which lowers your rewards. But they can't take what you've said off the blockchain. 
If you check out some of my posts and comments there (same name as here), you'll see I don't "discuss for cash" either. I don't make even close to enough to live on. However, the rewards I generate are those that the community feels I deserve.
There are plenty of bad actors who are just in it for the money. They will be flushed out in the end. Bad behaviour is incentivised in the short term but is unsustainable in the long term, especially if it grows to be such a problem that those with high stake start taking more action.

I know what you are saying with "actual real-life applications." I, too, am pretty sure 99% of these "infrastructure!!!!" chains will crash and burn, because in the end, they're built on absolutely nothing of real value.
Have a look at Steem. Blog-centric social network. You know this comment you just spent your time creating? I just upvoted you, but you don't get anything for that. Not even a cent. Reddit gets to monetise all the value you just generated, for free.
If we were having this conversation on Steem, you would have just gotten 10 cents when I upvoted your comment. Doesn't sound like a lot, sure. Will it make you a living? Probably not. But it sure as hell beats throwing that value in the garbage.

That's not a scam site; it's the Internet's oldest Bitcoin discussion forum. I think they have some troubles with people using VPNs and/or Tor in order to do "evil" (apparently we can express evil in precise _units_ now, heh heh).
do you have any plans to accept LN payments for this soon? I'm running into the same issues, and with payment amounts best expressed in sats... this is like, the _perfect_ use case for LN (tiny amounts, would benefit from instantaneous payments).
