Even if it is noise, people still need secure banking.

That's what holds crypto back, there is no one for the creeps to work for, so it's never in their favor to force us to use it, or make it easy for us to use it.

What kind of sandwich is that?

It might help to list the kind of phone you have. Often times an app problem will be just limited to android, iOs, or other operating systems.

You get to switch, but you shouldn't have to switch.

Aren't encoded zip archives pretty weakly encoded? I remember back in the "warez" days of software piracy there were programs that could reach into a ZIPed file and lift out the password in a few minutes on an early 2000's computer.

That's a good looking piece of work. I'm sure it was well received!

Would someone be able to make a token donation to a rotating address, then see where that address sent the BTC next, then keep track of whatever is coming into that presumed destination address?

These kinds of articles universally fall into two different camps.
1) Top 5 products/services that kicked the author a few bucks to be in the list
2) Top 5 products/services that come up at the top of google/yahoo/bing/dogpile when the author did a search, desperate for easy content
If you have to try 5 different wallets then something is wrong.

Is this a regular thing on CNBC? Does Bloomberg or FoxBusiness do the same?

You've succeeded in showing BTC dominating, but you've failed to make it look appealing.

Nicer, but in a way that's not as nice?

I'd be interested in seeing this information charted over time. I know the block number in the bottom left-hand corner gives a sense of how fast bit is being mined but I'd like to see the volume over time, presumably, the thin slice that Slush had in July 2017 was way bigger than the huge wedge that they had in 2012, for instance.

The dollar has an inflation target, so they are purposefully bleeding the value out of it. It serves as a tax on everyone who owns dollars, and it's paid to the central bank member banks as the interest on reserve deposits.

Thank you. This is useful information. There is a coin star an hour drive from me apparently. 
It’s a bit frustrating to see half this sub dedicated to people talking about how everyone should be doing crypto and the post and most of the replies are blaming me or telling me I’m not ready for crypto.

I just need 80 cents US worth. The options I've found have fallen into two categories. Not convenient, not cheap and not anonymous OR Not convenient, yes cheap, not anonymous. I spent four and a half hours tonight trying to get less than a dollar worth of bitcoin. If I weren't bald I'd be pulling my hair out.
Edit: I'm not even worried about anonymity, I'm looking to download a file with express written permission of the originator of that file. I just want something that seems reliably safe.

The internet wasn’t a household name in the 80’s. I remember the mid 90’s internet vividly. That was just as it was getting to be a household name, it seemed much less sketchy than this all does.

Thank you, that is what I used. 
Gonna cost me more in gas than to actually get the btc.

It's been 10 years. Bitcoin became a household name 5 years ago. How long is it going to be early days? Is it ever going to be available through a reputable online marketplace like Amazon or Ebay?
Edit: this isn't the early days of E-commerce. I can buy physical gold and physical US currency far more easily than I can buy btc online. If everyone is rushing into the market to make money, why don't they spend some of that money polishing their platforms once they get started? Most of the websites I found had frontends that looked like they were made for hundreds of dollars why not hire a web developer to make it look like a professional website for 0.125 btc?
