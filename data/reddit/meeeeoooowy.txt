You may want to remove bitfinex....

Do you have a better video to show a normal person an introduction/usefulness of the blockchain?

I think you missed my point. In this scenario I'm not restricted by any licenses because how are you going to prove anything without seeing my source code? It's hard to enforce, and with a little marketing (which is usually not a devs forte) then I can easily do well, especially if I've added my own spin on it to make it better.
No amount of laws or regulations will prevent you from driving through an intersection with a stop sign without stopping. If no one is there to see you, you won't get caught.
There are plenty of immoral people.

In reality it does mean you can copy and resale.
I'm not a mobile dev. But if I had the source code I could easily spend a week re-skinning it and moving shit around to make it look custom, especially because there are no servers.
I could then put ads in and it would totally be different enough where no one would think they are the same. Just a new competitor.

+1 for details. I'm considering the pros and cons of open sourcing one of my projects as well. 
If you are first to market with a fairly unique idea, open source will make it 100 times faster for someone to steal a huge chunk of market share.

 &gt;With this project, it is a glorified cryptocurrency wallet
Isn't it just a tracker? It just watches public addresses.
And your enterprise version can still do whatever the hell it wants to do. Basically you are doing a shit ton of work for nothing.
Edit: I'm not arguing that open source isn't a good thing or should ever be used...just don't see a good reason for this app.

They didn't say they know how it works, just that they figured enough out how to use it.
Same with Wireshark. You just need to follow directions enough to use it for a specific purpose. It's not that hard even if it still seems like magic.

What happens if the wallet dies and you can't get the cash out?
I need to go back and read if that's even possible.
Personally, I think I'd need to see the cash in my wallet first.
Oh, and I'm not chastising you either...just curious.
@_date: 2016-03-31 17:45:01
Interesting. I'd assume you would take it, and transfer the money first, and then hand over keys? Or just swap keys/wallet?

Would you accept this as payment for a car?

This has nothing to do with paying to view content. Simply a machine paying another machine for a service.

As solar becomes more popular I wonder if the price of computing will be correlated with how sunny it is in your area.

Ads take up a massive amount of resources, especially on mobile. Just throwing that out there.

The machine is paying like 3 cents for an API call.

I mean it should bug you, but that doesn't change the fact what they say usually isn't what they actually believe.

I can't wait to see what will happen to bitcoin in a financial crisis.
My bet is it goes up, but who knows... 
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:09:25
Patience is everything. I don't have to buy any bitcoin right now, why try to catch a falling knife?
I'd prob bite if it falls below 2k or when it evens out at some point.

I didn't argue anything... 
It's all about where people put their money. If the dollar is inflating and the economy really takes a shit one of the biggest issues is people pulling money out of the banks which is why we can have so much fdic insured.
Bitcoin is a much more convenient alternative to holding cash. Especially if it goes up in value vs the dollar which steadily goes down.
Personally I'm not sure what I'd do, but I'd probably keep a little chunk in Bitcoin. I think it would have to be a pretty drastic economic disaster though.

I usually buy when there are newsworthy massive dips. Doesn't happen very often but I've made a decent amount of money because of that.
Still haven't bought any on this dip yet...

Uh, bitcoin is WAY more volatile. Compare the forex charts if you'd like.

How does JavaScript ever execute an exe?

What is your definition of FU money? When my job got shitty I decided to quit and take a couple months off. I'm not even close to 1 million.

How does that first _5380.exe ever get executed though?
