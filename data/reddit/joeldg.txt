So, if you keep getting stuck there, you might want to try on an AWS instance maybe. 
It will run fine on the free tier of servers. 
You could even use AWS ECS as the docker container is built to use in AWS. I develop on a Mac and mostly use AWS for my servers.
I would just set up a free AWS instance and do it there.  For windows I think you can use Putty or one of the other console apps.

GDAX/Coinbase have been my nemesis through this whole thing.. they used to be good.
let me know if you need anything, I have been walking people through setup, even with Docker (you would be surprised) and making sure they can use the library. I need more feedback

I mean, I had a little script I wrote, before I wrote bowhead, that was faster and easier to use. It ended up, on my benchmarks, a better bet.. And, all it was was a simple straddler trying to catch dips and swings.
In Gekko, this would not have been possible, at least then..  Though, again. I like your project and support it..  
Bowhead is a different idea.. 
It is about teaching people to code their own bots, and show them how to do it, and then giving them binary libraries to do it, so it is easy.
There is no competition..  Gekko is a bot, plain and simple and calls itself a bot ... Bowhead is a bot making factory ...

The second article has an entire section about testing and literally benchmarking the twenty strategies on 10 different Forex pairs to see what works and what does not.
Gekko, I know and I understand, and I have ran it on my servers for a while.. It was not what I needed at the end, which is part of the reason I wrote bowhead.
edit:I don't want to sound dismissive of your efforts, I like Gekko, I do.. I ran it.. And I don't run shit, not unless I trust it..  I audited what you did and at the end I had a simple script that beat it which is not good..  That script became a generalized program, that program got slapped into a Lumen project, and then I decided to the open source it because that is how I am.. So.. in a way, you helped start this.

Hi, I am the author and we have set this up as a REST API to work in ANY language now. 
This new article provided new automated traders with 20 fully working strategies they can test and work with. And 12 signals, including a full signals library that does composites of these. It also provides a skeleton for a GDAX straddle bot and Forex straddles.    
If you want to learn about programming automated trading and have a quick start, this is it
I am looking for people interested in helping out with contributions as well.

as an employer, I am glad you are doing this on your own time  :)
If you need any help with anything, hit me up on Github

OP is the author of the Bowhead library and the article here. I use this daily and released it with the encouragement of the community.  I'm pretty responsive about code issues and any questions. There will also be some YouTube screencasts showing more advanced usage.

You can if you use Docker or run it on an AWS instance.
