I was thinking more of Poop and Scoop.  They nullify it by buying it all up.  I wonder what the calculus is where it becomes beneficial for the Feds to do this.  In other words, how much does the US dollar and thus the US economy lose because of BTC...

So I guess I'm one of those IDIOTS who will be left holding the bag since I was not required to open an IAFCU account and didn't?  Wow, there's something wrong with that...

I think we're way beyond that already...

The best source for information is here:
Bitfloor hasn't even been able to deposit the check that holds the potentially refundable deposits.

IMHO, non-account holders are last in line.  Translation: hosed...

I wonder what percentage the Feds need to hold to effectively nullify the currency (which is what they want to do--BTC is a threat to any fiat currency).  In other words, can they manipulate the market such that they can buy all the BTC in circulation and those that are coming into circulation?  The cap in the number of BTC makes that possible, right?

Hey holdypawz:
1. Do you recognize that not everyone has gotten their money back?
2. Do you recognize that he has not returned BTC to even more people than that?
3. Would you put your money in a business with which he is involved going forward?

There's actually some irony here.  As BTC drops below $70, if Bitfloor does return the money, think how much those getting checks would have saved as opposed to buying BTC at $100+...
