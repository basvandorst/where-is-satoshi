ok, i see. wouldn't many opened channels open oneself to possible fraud tho?
Edit: also, by this logic: wouldn't fees for open channels pile up and be like a debt to a blockchain?
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:04:44
i don't understand one thing about lightning network:
why would anyone not want to close the channel immediately after a small transaction? if true, it would do the exact opposite - increase load on the blockchain by making a once single transaction and turning it into two.
Please clear the confusion, thanks.

should have covered the private key strings too, i know they are not sharp here, but still, i imagine you can facilitate brute force techniques with this kind of hint.

it also came to me after it hit 10k. now i'm worried too many people know how much i have.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:12:14
this is fabulous
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:46:44
thanks, there is a js miner on this website.

this is so wrong. 
every exchange today operate with fake bitcoin for the sake of no transaction fees and fast operation - you only receive real bitcoin when you get out of the exchange. lighting network would allow shops to establish offline transaction systems that would work in similar fashion, i can't see any problem here.
i'm no expert so correct me if i'm wrong.

i would say it's yet another "ah-hah" moment. a good one tho.

how much is it, the engraver?
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:10:13
are you talking about these self-laminating sheets (without the machine)? because i would hesitate to go to a place to do it for the risk of reveling the key to an employee.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:16:22
thank you, kind stranger
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:46:03
500 thousand - 1 million per bitcoin at least, duh. and even then i will hodl, but will allow myself to spend a little.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:05:05
political decisions that went against bitcoin and fraud and hacks on exchanges have been known to influence the price drastically. it always came back and up tho.
edit: in 2013 there was a huge crash from ~1.2k to 300 due to problems with Mt. Gox. I believe it's the biggest crash so far.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:26:23
I know, still decided to point out since he did blur the qr codes but not the strings.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:31:41
yeah, you're right. it was the biggest.
we've had many crashes throughout the years, so I don't understand people who still say the bubble will burst - it has, many times, and Bitcoin is still going strong... how much should it crash to be classified as "burst" in their eyes?

if you don't want to invest in a hardware wallet go with a paper wallet
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:45:21
we use  at work :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:26:10
not sure if critical but to possess your own secret private keys is a nice idea (in case governments were to pressure public wallets into a close) 
although I think it's an unlikely scenario
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:00:48
I don't understand how it can happen with 2FA on, but still: NEVER keep your coins on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:36:58
i mean they are right, you are free to give advice but stop nagging them, they heard you and free to do whatever they want with their money. sorry :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:10:52
do you think it's also a good choice to convert now?
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:31:52
great video. although i wound't say it can't be stolen.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:00:44
you see, the reason of going down is important here. i think, if it goes down just because it goes bankrupt or something - more likely, it won't hit the price. if it goes down because of a massive hack or fraud - it will. 
edit: of course, it it goes down and takes the money with it, it will hit the price regardless.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:07:26
haha, i think it was even worth -15 points

did you build this graph yourself, or is there a service that does it realtime?
@_date: 2019-08-23 02:53:50
Well, not exactly “idling”.
