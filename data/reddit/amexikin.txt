For the gov to say that bitcoin is strong enough to pose a threat to nacional security is like saying the dollar is too weak!
Now they'll try to stop it.

That's a lower high. Very much doubt it'll make a higher high.

Yup, there are many ways the marketing could playa out, it has played the hype card form so long that it's no longer effective.
Price has to follow adoption otherwise it's a bubble.

If/when we hit 15/20k ppl that bought at that price and/or smart money will sell poping the bubble once again.

All they need is a user friendly payment system.

Eliot wave theory sugests that We will test 3k again, before that We will hit either 15k or 20k.choose Your entry point carefully.

Btc can't scale, FB is about copy n' crush not about adopting.

Needs to support a billion users in less than 1 second confirmation time, be near free to transact, the wallet has to be so easy and fun to use.

Thank You, sure, one of my biggest worries has been losing my funds. I guess creating different paper wallets and storing them safetly is the route to go for me. 
 
So, running a live USB Ubuntu drive to generate  the paper wallet be OK? And do I encrypt the wallet at the time I create it or do I do that in a separated session?

How can I make sure I won't be hacked?

Btc is also becoming centralised, part of that article is about that and how is becoming more susceptible to the 51% attack due to centralization of ASCI miners and the reduced network's hash power. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 14:18:35
Ok, got it. Thank You.
@_date: 2019-01-18 20:17:57
I want to start doing the same, how can I make sure that wallet is safe from hackers?

There are coins that can do certain things better IMHO. Store of value? Stable coins can do it better, anonymity? Privacy coins can do it better, smart contracts and utility? There are plenty blockchains out there, the only thing that btc has going is it's network but even it's hash power it's decling due to out going hashwars.
@_date: 2019-01-13 15:45:10
Your point of view is why I believe  people are setting themselves up for some pain! 
The hash wars are irrelevant to btc? Well, it takes money to fund any war, and the actors  are forks of btc. (Hint: they control keys on both networks) what do You think they are going to sell first to fund their ego's? Certainly not their network's coins. Love won't save Us.

Fractional reserve banking is fraud if being Judged by similar standards.... Liquidity crisis? WTF?

 Dude, the government  cracking down on illegal transactions, the blockchain is a public record that one can see. Those that thought using bitcoin to do illegal transactions was an excellent idea are dumb. That's why they're asking for ID. They'll link that identity and follow the bitcoin.
