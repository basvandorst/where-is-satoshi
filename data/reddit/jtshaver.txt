That's very odd, I've never heard of that, but it must be preapproved by the buyer. Are you allowed to specify any amount at all? Or is 15% a limit?

I was looking into it strictly as an investor.
What rate do you deal with PayPal chargebacks? Does the incidence rate of chargebacks increase if you lend higher amounts?
Do they have tools to mitigate chargeback risks? If so, how could you do so?
Have you run into any issues with PayPal wanting to close your account?

That's all good to hear, but does it actually work? I've sold millions worth of digital files and other things through PayPal, and they seem to reverse charges or not based on things outside of my control, regardless of any evidence I send.

How are you able to capture 15% more than the buyer (borrower) agreed to pay?

Also, I'm a bit unclear on why this is "lending" rather than the borrower "buying" the Bitcoin from me. They pay money, I send Bitcoin, sounds like buying.
Borrowing/lending implies that they can send the Bitcoin back to me, and get cash back. The FAQ page also mentions "Can give bitcoin back" as a difference between xcoins.io and an exchange.
So can the borrower send the bitcoins back to me at any time for money back? How does that work?

Interesting, I thought there have been articles saying stuff like this for the past couple of weeks. Is this trying to imply that there will be a complete ban on Bitcoin apart from investing in its value like a stock?

Thanks! Let me know how your experience is if you decide to grab anything with Bitcoins :)

I was surprised how easy it was to understand. Obviously it takes practice to see trends more quickly and accurately, but with some practice it can definitely help us make more informed decisions.

I was so excited to see a bitpay invoice email this morning! I'm assuming everything worked well for you?
If so, I think its time to promote this on Monday. :)

So would you say it's worth buying today, waiting a couple weeks, or splitting it up between now and then?

Thanks for the insight. The module is Uc_bitcoin for drupal/ubercart. I'm not sure if you can specify the number of confirmations required. I'll test the module tomorrow. Would that be a module thing or a bitcoin thing?
I'd definitely do 0 confirmations if possible, because like you said, they are not super valuable items and are digital goods.
Sounds like the best benefits would be the hype and fact that bitcoiners simply like paying in bitcoin.
Do you think its worth offering 25% off to people who pay in bitcoin to get them to do it? Or maybe a 5% markup for people paying in bitcoin instead? Neither?

A lot of times people get a huge discount for advertising, so although the asking price is $2/listing, people negotiate down to $1 or even $.50/listing.
If you offer something special like $.70/listing if they pay in Bitcoin, you're still earning the same amount, but also benefiting from the Bitcoin economy, and not having to deal with buying/selling Bitcoin with fiat.

Gotcha, thanks. I figured as much and should have checked about r/coinbase first

In my quest to become more informed about bitcoin, I've been reading more on reading not just candlestick chart basics, but seeing trends as well.
I thought this was a great introduction and thought others might be interested in reading it as well.

Design Panoply now accepts bitcoin through Bitpay for graphic design resources.
To get the ball rolling, everything is 25% off when paying with bitcoin!
I'd love to hear any thoughts on the checkout process or products if you decide to pick something up.
Special thanks to u/captaingraviton for testing things out with me.

Interesting, thanks for the insight :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:28:35
Ah, I must've missed that or not known what it meant at the time. 
You're right in the other stuff. Thanks again :)
I'd bitcoin tip you burn my first order hasn't gone through yet.

To create a cohesive brand, you can't do something like this to the Bitcoin logo.
The only Bitcoin logos that should be used are these: 
Even then, I'd highly suggest stopping before you get to "Euro Style", as everything after that is branded completely differently, and confusing to people who aren't familiar with Bitcoin.
The "Gold Style" is alright, but teetering on the edge of acceptable, like a creepy uncle that nobody likes, except sometimes he'll give an awesome birthday present so he is accepted as one of the family on rare occasions.

I didn't know r/coinbase existed, so I'm assuming it's related to this: 
Although no one has mentioned the same error that I see.

Gotcha, just emailed you. Thanks :)
