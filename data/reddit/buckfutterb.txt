Let's wait till all the major exchanges and wallets support it before we go nuts.

It's only lead to bickering and BTC forks being more relevant than BTC itself.  When we hit sub 10-second transactions for under a penny I'll climb back onboard.  Until then, I value speed and transaction cost in my portfolio above all else.  Just a decision I've made, as a consumer I have no interest in using BTC in its current state and I can't see it getting functionally up to speed before the critical masses have already been educated and bought into the other coins that run circles around it.  Time has passed it by IMO and it will be too late to recover.  BTC is basically the Blackberry of crypto and we're in the very early days of ios and android at the moment.  In the end Blackberry had a thoroughly competitive OS, but it was far, far too late.

It has no real world application?
The tokens are being used in banking trials, sure banks can license the ripple platform and implement their own tokens but that's not the way things are headed.  You don't follow much do you?
It has infinitely more real world use as of today than BTC has ever had.

I bought into BTC 3 years ago for $300, gambled most of it away and still had 5 BTC in my wallet 3 months ago.  I'm not a noob, but I'm fairly new to investing, and despite the tremendous accidental value my BTC has grown to I feel zero attachment to a coin that doesn't work, and despite what you say has taken forever to implement a solution to making it usable again.  Public interest in crypto is at an all time high yet everyone and their uncle is being told to buy into Ethereum and not BTC so they can trade it.  That's literally the first piece of advice you'll hear anyone getting.  BTC's missing its opportunity to assert dominance as no business in their right mind would setup shop to accept a coin that takes hours to arrive and costs more than $2 per transaction.  The alt coins are making the most of this opportunity.  BTC won't see the $1,000,000 mark, sorry bruh.  And yes, Monero and XRP do have a lot of real world traction already, I imagine Verge will overtake Monero on the dark web and other online retail channels once wraith takes flight.  BTC will be on the sidelines holding its dick saying don't worry guys, I'm somehow better than these coins for no reason at all.

Umm, the upgraded SWIFT road map is about as advanced as Blockbuster deciding to go into DVD mail delivery while Netflix was already in full-streaming mode.  Their plans don't address the superior competitive advantage of the blockchain - XRP and XLM will prevail.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:19:59
How is it better?  Comparing one extremely volatile, easily manipulated crypto to another doesn't really tell us anything concrete.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:10:46
We'll see how XRP pans out.  I do think XLM's future is insanely bright and that they're going in exactly the right direction with it.  I'm no longer buying XRP (I started under a quarter and stopped at .80).  I think XLM is the better value with an equally bright future at this point.  Cheers to our Lumens!

You need to get off your high BTC horse.  In terms of actual use, it's BTC that's the shitcoin.  It brings nothing to the table that the other 99 of the top 100 don't, yet it costs exponentially more in time and money to transfer than any other coin and any solutions being implemented are nowhere in sight as its own community of supporters gets more and more fragmented.  If you can't see the writing on the wall for that sinking ship of a shitcoin then I feel sorry for you.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:23:16
I'm not here to get rich either but as a hobby with very high rewards I'm certainly trying to do as well as a hodler possibly can.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:37:31
It's a safer gamble than putting all my eggs into an overvalued, technically inferior crypto with no actual real world use case other than storing funds (and it even does that poorly). I'll take the diversified portfolio with coins that actually have a promising road map and real world use case Alex. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:43:14
Unless they take your etransfer deposit and ignore your emails and support tickets for four days while erasing any trace of the funds you sent them from their site. Just grand. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:06:22
That "worthless shit" has a pending coinbase addition to deal with along with a massive financial institution investment surge coming Tuesday. It will probably grow another 50% this week alone, meanwhile bitcoin plummets. Probably should have waited a week or so... just saying. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:11:46
And yet it grew more than your BTC since... good job. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:12:44
Buying low would be waiting for 12K again... in a week you'll see how dumb that move was.

TDIL I am smarter than Brian Armstrong.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:31:56
So all that XRP I bought at 25 cents and is now worth a few year's salary to me is just me getting duped?
What intrinsic value does bitcoin have that Ripple doesn't? Nothing.. it doesn't even have a clear roadmap into mainstream use, ironically bcash does though. Congrats on owning your 80s era microwave and putting all your eggs into that basket. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:29:32
XRP will probably dominate financial markets but XLM is setup to be the  solution and looks to be gaining more traction in consumer oriented markets as it is.  Having IBM back it is a huge boon and if it's truly powering the upcoming  exchange/platform then it's an easy 3-5x in value.  It might look a bit boring now compared to some of the other coins that are popping off, but it's setup for a large surge and I think Ripple's success is going to have a lot of investors looking towards XLM which will only help its value too.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:39:14
Marketcap is swinging dramatically in favour of the alt-coins.  Bitcoin's "dominance" is dwindling.  It will get pumped and dumped as it always does, just as every other coin does, but XRP will surpass it in 2018, which in turn will probably get passed over at some point later down the line.  Having a somewhat stable fiat currency as a measuring stick makes far more sense.  The cyrpto world no longer revolves around that shitcoin anyway.  Kids getting into crypto in 5 years will wonder what the hell a satoshi is only to see it references some coin that used to be on top, but they'll already understand the concept of USD.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:03:18
USD is a better standard IMO. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:55:44
But why do you care how many sats they're worth when you're cashing out into USD?  You're not buying that lambo with your BTC (at this rate you never will, maybe they'll accept Monero or Verge though and that's my point).
You only get token X in relation to a coin itself that is volatile and manipulated and by no means the gold standard.  It tells us nothing in the end of our actual wealth or portfolio value.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:20:28
The back-end systems are ancient and extremely costly.
Ripple is literally aiming to replace those systems with their own platform (controlled) which may or may not be powered by the XRP currency (not-controlled other than the monthly escrow releases which is really no different than mining).
You nailed one of the reasons why Ripple is so valuable trying to be clever.  Bitcoin adds nothing to the equation, Ripple adds a tremendous amount of value.  On the banking side it's setting up as a replacement to SWIFT.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:31:31
So the value of my portfolio relative to bitcoin means nothing, it's value relative to USD means something.  I'm not new, been around long enough to realize Bitcoin is nearing supernova status, it's time to move on.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:10:14
You realize it doesn't work like that at all right? XRP reserves are in escrow and the amounts released are pre-determined. It sounds silly but the lack of mining is far better for the planet and its resources too. The BTC community is spreading a hilarious amount of FUD when they should probably be welcoming a third blue chip coin to the game and diversifying like any smart investor would. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:53:11
If devs were responding in a timely manner why is every other crypto out there quicker and cheaper to transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:25:36
Or pretty much any top 50 alt.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:38:10
~~months~~ years.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:11:51
Don't care, it works.  Bitcoin doesn't work.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:43:11
Better for both.  If you watch alt movement it's easy to see sometimes it's clearly coordinated with BTC and ETH, sometimes one and not the other, sometimes there's no correlation at all.  Having other alt coins as measuring sticks doesn't really tell us how one coin in particular is doing in terms of its value.  It's not like BTC is the gold standard, it's too an extremely volatile, easily manipulated coin.  USD not so much.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:29:03
That will be like getting hit in the head with a cotton ball.  Not too worried.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:12:12
I agree, I'm a grown man who's bought a Nintendo Switch and a PSVR recently with my own money and the other half just kinda smiled at what a kid I am not caring that I spent so much money on toys that keep me away from things she wants me to do lol
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:33:08
Why wouldn't they want to carry the  crypto?
People are coming into crypto in droves looking to exclusively buy Ripple and are finding non-Coinbase solutions to do so. Also the companies are a stones throw away and there's already been leaks of Ripple being beta tested on Coinbase.  It's a slam-dunk.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:39:02
They can always transfer it from Coinbase -&gt; GDAX -&gt; Binance to avoid fees but explaining that to someone who's new and thinks blockfolio actually stores their coins is a bit hard.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:34:48
~~I dumped a third of my btc into XRP at 25 cents (and all of my litecoin) and I've just dumped another third of it into XLM. I can always buy back the bitcoin, it's not going to double in value by February. XRP might be 20x by then since my original investment and XLM 3-4x. I'm just a dummy though.~~
*edit: was replying on mobile, just realized I replied to the wrong comment whoops*
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:11:37
I got my Ripple in at 24 cents thank you (and again at 48).  It's pretty much the only coin with a real-word application (other than storing cash) today.  The banking partnerships have a lot more to do with this pump than coinbase.  If you followed the coin you'd know all the interest (and buyers) was coming out of Japan and Korea because of the banks over there.  But thanks for playing.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:13:37
Fair points, as everything is mostly speculative at this point these coins could turn out to be fantastic innovations but ... only be worth a fraction of what we think they're worth so yeah... something's going to give at some point, at least for a lot of them.
Don't worry about my 5 BTC, I put the better half of 4 of them into XRP (mostly at 25 cents) so if I wasn't a greedy pig I could easily cash out its original value by now or put it back into BTC and just have a mountain of XRP to show for it.  But there's no fun in that.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:24:41
Once the coins have been deployed there's nothing centralized or pre-mined about it.
And if BTC has a scaling solution why is it virtually useless as a transnational currency?  Is it always going to lag behind every single other coin and then take forever to catch up?  Sounds like the US auto manufacturers in the 1980's to me... good plan.
