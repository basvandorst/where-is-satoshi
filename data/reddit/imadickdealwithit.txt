Herpa derp derp 


A new blockchain is generated around every ten minutes and then shared throughout the network. This means it's constantly growing as completed "blocks" are made and added to the public ledger.

Exactly and it looks like bitcoin is compromised  
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:41:13
Or Gavin and co will turn bitcoin into AOL and some other coin will take over like Google. Who the fuck knows but I'm keeping my ears to the ground.

Oh come on it's funny

You need to buy a miner. An ASIC. Basically a machine that is designed to do nothing else but to hash using SHA256. At this time, you need to do at least a 200 GH/s to get anywhere. And by anywhere i mean ear .01 BTC in like a week! 
If you want a bitcoin, just go buy a bitcoin! the mining train left the station a long.. looong time ago.

Yes! Same as why sql is sooooo much more expensive than Oracle right ?

QA? I'm mean the community will look at the finished model and say, "yeaaaa... um.. that's not what we asked you to make"  and thank to "oracles" and multi-sig they won't get their payment since the product didn't match the specs.  Just spit-balling here.

We won't have peace in the middle-east. DAOs can't stop occupation now can they? at least for now.

I'm not saying anything about "dark derp". All I'm saying is that the open-source community was able to synchronize around the world and create software that we use every fucking day and some argue it's better written than some of it's closed-source competitors. Take Apache and IIS for example. Now, with the advent of the blockchain, cooperation between the open-source community will get even stronger, because now they can raise money (light house) and vote (consensuses mechanisms) and pay for some factory in china to fab what they need fabbed. Am I making my point across?

@_date: 2015-02-17 16:32:44
I get that. This whole open source thing has been working without the benefit of the blockchain technology. You add blockchain, DAOs,DAPs etc and we'll do Linux for hardware.
