None of my cards even do a soft pull for an increase. They look at my history and all have determined or asked if Id like one. All from amex to store card I have never had an issue with hurting my credit score.

You can literally look up charting figures for SNAP. You had to of lied on your application to receive more than what is set.
The max pell grant is less than 6k and can only have one out at a time over a 12 month period for an individual school. So again stop spewing bullshit because unless you're going to a community college that isn't going to cover an entire tuition, fees, books etc... of any bachelor program anywhere.
When you qualify for Medicaid you're also give resources for a list of people who accept it. You can't just go into some random doctors office and ask for service just because you have it. That 1 dollar copay is also bullshit. Just visit medicaid.gov and make yourself look like a complete spunkmouth. You have absolutely no clue what you are talking about.
Just because I was fortunate enough to not have to use these items doesn't mean I can't educate myself on them. I also don't need to lie on the internet to try and make it seem like the US is just handing out free shit everywhere.

Your post just screams ignorance. I assume you're talking about section 8 housing which a voucher is given and you pay a certain % based on your income. You also don't go anywhere near 1k a month for a family of 4 in food stamps/SNAP. You barely reach 700. Please show me where any kid gets free college within the US on a mass scale.....medical care is also based on income and a tax credit is given for that. You also have to pay a certain deductible before it will cover most things.
There are also mental health hospitals all over america the only issue is they still cost money from insurance and it has to come from somewhere.
