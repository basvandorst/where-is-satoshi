So what will happen to the users bitcoin account for lack of a better word when the Bitcoin ban is implemented. Will the person in some way or another be able to retrieve his/her money after the ban?

When do CBOE global markets open, what time and what time zone?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:51:22
Okay so theoretically what would happen if all 21 million Bitcoins are mined, what happens then and how far are we from it?

Looks like people really aren't reacting well to the potential idea of CBOE global markets opening futures trading of Bitcoin on 10 December 2017 @ 18;00 pm Eastern Time. Oh boy!

Talking about the LOTTO though in most countries playing 1 line of Lotto gives you a 1 in 12 million chance to win it due to the usually 49 numbers, in my country the chances of wining is 1 to 20,358,520 due to 52 numbers option. Anyway that's crazy, rather play Bitcoin it's better after all! :D

Yeah with our luck, on our way to Mars we will probably over shoot and aim for Jupiter..... Or the astroid belt.

I am hoping for the damn dip people!
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:24:03

I strongly suspect Bitcoin to dip mid January 2018. It's one of the most difficult months of the year. Especially after holiday season in the Southern hemisphere. Don't known about you guys up North though. Well Remind Me! 50 days!

Yes I think it be going down to 10K easily and maybe even below that as the day go on, but don't know what to expect from CBOE global markets and CME group.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:55:20
Honesty won't be surprised, if this happens.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:25:10
Yeah definitely!

[STRAWPOLL: What will happen when CBOE global markets starts futures trading Bitcoin on 10 December 2017?](
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:39:05
Interesting how the first HODL comment was made on 18 December 2013 and CME group will commence Bitcoin futures trading on 18 December 2017. LOL
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:42:19
But I think the reason its going down is the fact that [South Korea government announced banning futures on Bitcoin]( Apparently there is a sizeable market in South Korea. So yeah anyway.

CBOE global markets are opening this Sunday 10 December 2017 and CME group are opening 18 December 2017, On November 1, 2017 CME announced they will begin trading in Bitcoin futures by the end of 2017, pending regulatory approval. Bitcoin price surged immediately breaking above $7000 benchmark. CME group traded as NASDAQ. The Nasdaq Stock Market is an American stock exchange. It is the second-largest exchange in the world by market capitalization, behind only the New York Stock Exchange located in the same city. As well as The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, often abbreviated as the S&amp;P 500, or just the S&amp;P, which is an American stock market index based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ. The big players are coming out to play ball. You know people don't invest in things they don't feel confident about as all of you already know. The value if Bitcoin is gonna rocket big time.

Imagine CBOE global markets open and for some odd reason1 BTC = 1 Dollar.....1 Zimbabwean Dollar!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:57
This is gonna go up until CBOE global markets opens future trades on 10 December 2017! Expect 1 BTC = 28 000 US$ on Saturday.

This morning I woke up and said to myself fuck this shit I am gonna buy some Bitcoin for the very first time. Went online and did it.
Anyway I am still kicking myself to this very day for not buying back in 2013 when I heard it for the very first time trading at R1500 or approximately the equivalent of 10 US$. Oh well so that's that.
