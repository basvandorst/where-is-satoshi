Genie Genie on the wall how generous is bitcoin millionaire after all?

Yeah, in his pictures he put the december 1st 35% drop. That was sheep going down. the only way for him to cash out is to sell them in person. Im sure the cartels will get to him/them first tho :)
I think the drop off when it spiked to 1k was when people who were inflating the price by selling small amounts of coin for alot of money, stopped at 1k a coin and then cashed out their 25k coin stash. The MASSIVE amount of exposure it has gotten since then has shown that it has only increased in value since. Only being affected by scammers or hackers. 
The biggest drop was when silkroad bitcoins were completely removed from the system. I believe that if the USA starts selling them there could be a significant drop.
However, as long as more people are spending bitcoins and more bitcoins get mined it will go up in value. I believe bitcoin is a solid investment especially companies like bitpay.com making it so easy for stores to accept bitcoin and cash out the same day, week or month and get the value that they expected from them at the time.
When bitcoin atms(EASY access to coins), stores accepting bitcoin are more common place. It will not be long for the value to double and beyond. Eventually everyone will want a piece of the pie. There is actually very little risk in buying/spending of bitcoin.
Right now the biggest problem is to get people to acquire bitcoins EASIER and have more places they can SPEND them.
I cant wait to see what happens in the next few years. Trying to get my boss to accept bitcoin at our computer repair shop :P

Can someone explain this to someone who doesnt really understand bitcoins fully? Is this a good  or bad thing? Will the value of a bitcoin go up? Ive never been able to understand bit coin mining and such fully x.x

Do realize that december first is when 95 000 bitcoins were stollen on sheep market place. Massive cash-outs can cause a drop too.

Thank you for this link. But boy do I feel sick now.
One more reason to use bitcoin.

Yep, big cashouts are good. Theyll get redistributed slowly to more people and the value will surpass what it was once before. I don't think they're will be exponential growth for a while, but a slow steady increase.
