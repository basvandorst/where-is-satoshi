Thank you! Your e-mail has been sent.  
   
I just told them I wouldn't buy from them again until they accepted bitcoins, then deleted all my credit cards.
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:18:50
Aaaand that's how the world get fucked. By giving bankers the keys to their money. Bitcoin gives us one chance to re-educate people, let's not screw it up.

Yes! Those are the best kind of news.  
Banks not being able to mess with bitcoin ... it's ... beautiful.
@_date: 2014-03-21 11:57:41
Yes, I was definitely making it harder on myself, but for good reasons:    
1) I was persuaded that I would be able to find all the info in one place, it just makes sense (I have European bank accounts and they have it all in one long number, the IBAN)   
2) then to prove my point (i.e. that they suck)  
3) also, having to make a call to get such trivial information is madness

You are such a troll anyway, just like any good american kid :)

The fact that they do not even acknowledge your messages is a shame. Go public. Fuck them. If you don't, more people will get screwed on the long term. It's your responsibility to let the people know about those exploits. Such dishonest and incompetent businesses are bad for bitcoin and should not be allowed to strive. So sooner they go down the better.
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:22:06
I always say that bitcoins should be traded in person, for cash or something, then that's a real peer-to-peer transaction! You're done in a minute and you don't feed the banks or the shady exchanges. Find people at meetups or on specialized websites.
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:52:59
Already got an answer. Pretty standard stuff but i'm much impressed anyway.   
Hopefully they'll get enough requests to change their mind.
Hello, 
I understand that you'd like to use bitcoins for your online purchases. 
Don't worry, I immediately forwarded your suggestion regarding with the use of bitcoins to our Payments Department. Rest assured that this will be looked into as we're looking for improvements for our website. 
Thanks again for your suggestion. We look forward in seeing you again soon.
Best regards,

Indeed, as long are people remain uneducated they will always be fucked. But Bitcoin gives you a chance as someone educated to fight back. You can't really fight back with gold, it's too inconvenient.

France banking system integrated bitcoin ? wtf
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:18:44
Yes, you should. It's always nice to report a bug that they probably haven't identified.  
If you want to see your 8.00 BTCs show up just transfer everything to a new paper wallet. It's was probably just a one-off.
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:45:26
Would it break their balls to translate their own news ?   
Because they do have an English version of the website...

You guys have no idea what a 7 years old kid can do with a computer.   
Mining BTC is actually easy compared to the complex systems they are able to manage (i.e. I've seen an 8 year old doing this:

Are you guys already trusting the same website and source of information that betrayed you minutes ago ? First news was posted to push the price down, why wouldn't this one simply be used to push the price up ? That's how whales make money...

Is the deal off if BRK invests massively in bitcoin ?

Good thing. My point was to not jump back on the train too quickly (and potentially being fooled twice).

Problem is with all the startups, they want guidance.    
I also believe that the bitcoin community has more influence now than it will ever have once the big banks and other lobbies heavily get involved.

I like companies who refuse to deal with US customers, it shows they are extra careful.

You can also send your bitcoins to another address. That's the first thing I did after getting the KYC request.

Never tell a kid that he is smart. Tell him to keep up the good work. Otherwise he will think he was born smart and thus always will be, which leads him to become a lazy ass :)

For 100% security he should also destroy the paperwallets.

bitcoin + kiteboarding on front page... looks like both have come a long way! it's nice to see.  
Great explanation btw.
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:17:43
It is true that Bitcoin is not the low level protocol that internet is. All coins can be treated as companies and in that aspect they can fail or be replaced by superior technology. However, as we can see, the internet evolved but was never replaced, it still stands on it's old foundations, despite the many alternatives and superior ways to achieve the same function. I believe Bitcoin will benefit from being the first mover, like the internet. That is, unless Bitcoin is more like ARPANET, then we will just have to be quick to move our coins.
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:33:05
Coinbase has only four software engineers working for them. None of them being qualified to develop websites of this scale. I am pretty sure that most of the development is outsourced in India or somewhere. Thus it is not a surprise that coinbase's usability and security is... well, shit. Not to mention that their support sucks, that they do not check their bounty program email address, that they take weeks to fix anything, etc.
  
I strongly advise anyone to avoid coinbase like the plague.
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:23:49
You just proved my point. Thank you.

This guys will dump bitcoins on the exchange right before the bet ends and simultaneously buy tons of BRK. People with 300 BTCs to lose can certainly do this.

When looking for a bank, don't focus on the facade but rather focus on the people and the company behind it. A good design and user experience does not means they are honest and competent.

Sorry but I have better things to do than remember my bank account number + my bank's address + their routing number + all this kind of shit.
But mostly, I only recently opened the account so I didn't have it somewhere in one document (which I now do of course).

You said it.  
Don't leave this to chance. And there is praising and praising...   
If he succeeds at something and you say "you're smart" he will think he succeeded because he is smart. Which is untrue. You should instead comment on what really happened, that is, he did a good job, so you say "good job".   
Anyway, I guess they need a bit of both worlds and that's why we have mothers and fathers :)

The sender is a large company which does not work with PayPal.  
I didn't miss this chance to recommend them to consider bitcoin/coinbase.  
Also, I've used PayPal in the past and it's a crappy/evil service/corporate monster.
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:14:00
Exactly. People tend to assimilate bitcoin to a company it seems.
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:39:35
Oh and it's been a month, which is a perfectly reasonable delay. Also, don't think you are the only who know about this exploit...
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:39:45
You realize that you have to pay your debts with inflated money, right ?
Unless your salary increases faster than inflation (i.e. &gt;8%), you are being screwed.
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:11:20
True that. But pretty much every French person knows about them, so it's still great news.
@_date: 2014-04-21 21:06:06
You just said this:


So why did you argue above that debt is diminished by inflation ?


Are you a troll ? Because I think you are.
Regarding the inflation rate, read the comment above about the GDP and my answer to it mentioning the CPI. Now if you want to argue that the CPI is realistic, go ahead, but don't expect any answers from me, just do your own research (i.e. write down the price of everything you buy and come back in a year).

Did he have to answer all questions to get back the money he just transferred ?
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:29:53
I put my money in bitcoin, not in the companies building on top of it.
That would be like buying "internets".  
EDIT: [Vespera]( is right, I should have said "crypto-currencies" instead of "bitcoin". And [danielravennest]( advice to diversify your portfolio by buying altcoins is very sound.

Give him some love. We are here to argue and this could be a legitimate argument, no matter how weak it is.

I didn't know about the rent thing but I'm not even surprised. It's like the CPI that doesn't include energy and food for some reason.
These guys are past the arguing point btw, they directly teach all their bullshit to kids in schools and universities nowadays.
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:35:43


  
I never thought about it this way, but you are right indeed. One way to understand this is to imagine a kid who believes that he is stupid... that would be terrible. Thanks for enlightening me on this point :)

Yahoo! on Google Trends: 
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:45:01
Agreed. I was only mentioning this insecure backup system because he was talking about 0.3 BTC only.   
Most people don't get much of anything indeed but the good thing is that other smarter people will take care of the complex things for them. One day Bitcoin will be even simpler to deal with than the current banking system. Have some hope :)

It seems stupid but it works because most thieves are quite dumb and in a hurry as well as under a lot of stress.  
I used to live in an area with very frequent house robberies (at gun point) and having fake purses and wallets was a very effective way to get robbers out quickly. We also had more than one safe.
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:29:35
Good point. But crypto lasts usually longer than functioning and honest governments.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:34:53
I tried Armory and it was very unstable.
So far all the wallets I tried were unstable or lacked the most basic features anyway.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:46:27
Why not keep the name bitcoin ?
There would be "old bitcoin" and "new bitcoin", the later gradually becoming "bitcoin". That's what happened to the franc and it worked.
@_date: 2014-03-17 03:43:40
How does one monitors an address and get alerts ?
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:53:06
They think they do. But they don't.  
If I want to use crypto or gold, I can.   
Anyway, we don't even need banks anymore. They're nothing but glorious exchanges like bitstamp or btc-e, with much heavier regulations and some additional services. They too, keep your money on secured servers in the form of bits.
@_date: 2014-04-05 00:27:38
unfortunately people don't understand that, like they don't understand why you shouldn't trust a bank with your dollars.
@_date: 2014-03-15 06:55:43
You know very well what I mean when I say "internet", I'm talking about the TCP/IP protocol, 'cause that's what it is.

The other lesson he should learn: Always backup your wallets! Had he had a backup he wouldn't give a fuck and could laugh at the principal's stupid face!   
In this case, taking a picture with his phone, copying the priv key on another paper, etc, would have been enough.
@_date: 2014-03-17 05:27:14
Thanks, I didn't know they provided this service!
@_date: 2014-03-17 03:41:51
exactly my thought.  
the good thing is that in a few years even the smallest amount we own now will be worthwhile!  
anyway, you can easily trick this (smart) malware by hiding your encrypted wallets and only having open ones visible. steganography is the way to go.
@_date: 2014-04-29 06:06:05
I told them to just send the money back.
Here is their answer:
thank you for your cooperation.
However, in order to fully satisfy our additional KYC procedure, wekindly ask you to please send us any financial documentation which can confirm the origin of your sent funds, such as savings account statement, salary pay slip, tax revenue statement or similar.
We require a passport as part of our standard additional KYC procedure which requires that we obtain additional ID verification documents (preferably international passport) and providing some additional information on your activities on your Bitstamp account.
Should you require any additional assistance during this time, please feel free to ask.
Best regards,
