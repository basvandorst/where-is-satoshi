Correct me if I am wrong but how is their daily volume only 5 million $?  Wouldn't that be less than 10,000 btc trades a day at current prices? 
Also, you are not including the other cryptos they have which would be ETH, LTC and now ETC which also have a fair chunk of trading volume.

Not even an address in their contact page. Sounds legit..

So bitcoin buying is now compared to investing in blackjack... 
That sounds reassuring to new prospective buyers or its future as a currency! :)

The reversal would have been interesting if the price of btc had fluctuated a lot before the reversal. 
Not sure how someone who sold their btc and got reverse traded would feel if their btc prices had fallen and they would have otherwise sold it in such a situation.
