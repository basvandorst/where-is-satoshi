"Bits" is a terrible name. I support pretty much any alternative such as "ubits", "mubits", "xbits", "microbits", etc. Shortening "microbitcoins" to just "bits" is as stupid of an idea as shorting "kilometer" to "meter".

Bearwhale confirmed


During the analysis for between March and when we ultimately filed, there was activity on that in the exchanges. 
For example, it essentially looked like someone could essentially be doing something [manipulating bitcoin price]. It triggered flags on our system to advise us to look out, look at this behavior which we did. 
We made the phone call, spoke to the technology personnel and also spoke to the underlying controllers of the account. They said no. We know these players. There is nobody moving the market. There is no wash trade. 
We have that information at our disposal, so we can constantly monitor it.

You just can't do this. You can't shorten 'kilometer' to 'meter', you can't shorten 'milliliter' to 'liter'. It is unnecessarily confusing and causes paradoxical situations such as having 'millibit' represent a value greater than a 'bit'. Use 'ubit' or 'uBTC' or 'µbit' or 'µBTC' or 'microbit'. Anything really except 'bit'.

No. We can actually choose a name that does not cause confusion. 'Bit' is the only suggestion that conflicts with current usage. 'µbit' for example does cause any confusion in any way. It is perfectly clear exactly what it means just by looking at it.


And that is why we shouldn't shorten 'ubit' or 'µbit' to just 'bit'. It would make much more sense to write them as either 'uB' or 'µB' and could be shortened in speech to just 'yous' or 'mews' respectively. Either of these proposal has all of the same benefits of 'bit', i.e. short and memorable, without any of the conflicts and without pissing off and alienating the sizable portion of the community that is very much against 'bit' for all of the reasons you just gave.

How about the people wanting 'bits', tell us which of the many very good suggestions, that wouldn't cause confusion with commonly used bitcoin nomenclature, they like best. "Bits" is a non-starter. If you think 'bits' is a good idea, then why don't you send me 10 millibits (=0.010 BTC) and I'll send you back 10 millibits (=1 Satoshi)? Fair trade?
Why not 'ubits'? Pronounced 'you-bit'? Not only would this eliminate all possible confusion, but it fits perfectly in line with the already commonly used uBTC = microbit = ubit.

I think 'bits' is an absolutely horrible idea. We already use the root word 'bits' as in 'millibits' to mean 0.001BTC. We already call 0.000001BTC a 'microbit'. To now change the meaning of the root 'bit' in regards to bitcoin usage is beyond stupid.
Does this community so completely lack creativity that it can't come up with a better name than 'bits'?

Last I checked cryptography is not 'very far removed' from bitcoin. And the fact is, if it wasn't for the pioneering contributions of Turing and others, we wouldn't be having this discussion right now.
Satoshi is already used for the smallest unit of bitcoin. I don't care to change anything and will continue to use millibits and microbits as I have for the last year+. I just don't want to see 'bits' adopted as I think it is as stupid of an idea as calling kilometers, 'meters'. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:53:16


It is insane. We already use 'bit' to be short for bitcoin, as in 'millibit' to mean a milli-bitcoin. We can't now start using 'bit' to mean a 'microbit'.
@_date: 2014-05-03 15:21:40


Ok, then call it something else. We don't call kilograms "grams", we don't call millimeters "meters", and we shouldn't call microbits "bits".
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:11:00


Me for one, I used to work at NIST.


I'm not saying that we shouldn't use micro-bitcoins as the base unit. My point is that you can't call it a 'bit' without creating confusion. Call it something other than 'bit' because we already use the root word 'bit' in reference to bitcoin value and it has a different meaning that 0.000001BTC. If fact, when we say 'millibit', we are implying that 'bit' is short for 'bitcoin'. 


I'm not exactly sure what you mean here as I don't see how it would be any more difficult to explain since we are only talking about the name being different, i.e. 'ubit' vs 'bit' to mean 0.000001BTC. What I want to know is, if we adopt 'bit', how are you going to explain that 0.000001BTC is called a 'bit' and 0.001BTC is commonly called a 'millibit'.

I'm not arguing about anything but the name. I don't care if people want to use 10^-6 BTC as a new base unit. I'm cool with that. My issue is with the name 'bit', specifically. It is a silly and confusing name which adds zero benefit and seriously conflicts with already used conventions, namely, 'microbits' and 'millibits'. 
Call them 'ubits' (pronounced 'you-bit'), or 'µbit' (pronounced 'mew-bit), or anything else. Just don't call them 'bits' because otherwise we'll have to explain to new users that a 'millibit' is actually larger than a 'bit', defying any sense of logic.

They won't need to use 'millibit' to be confused, they will only need to see it in writing on the internet or overhear it once.


The fact that the 'bit' supporters think that a poll on bitcointalk has any say in this is what is funny. It is a cesspool. Might as well hold the vote on 4chan. They also seem to think that reddit upvotes/downvotes should decide this. Do you really think that just because someone has 10 alt accounts on this website they should have 10x the votes that I do? And you do realize that less than 1% of the bitcoin community is participating in this discussion? And yet I keep hearing that a 'majority' support this proposal. That is not democracy. If you want to make it fair, and insure that only those with skin in the game have a say in this, voting on the blockchain is the only solution. You can't give each address it's own vote because each person could have as many addresses as they wish. A vote by holdings, a "proof of stake" is the only fair way.
If you want to talk about inefficiency, choosing 'bit', which is the only one of the proposals that conflicts with current usage is incredibly inefficient. We've already wasted far more time discussing it than such a terrible idea ever merited.

You would say "twenty two thousand mews" or "twenty two thousand mew-bits" or "twenty two em-bits" since 22000 µbit = 22 mbit.
I disagree that people will naturally shorten 'mew-bit' to 'bit'. It would make much more sense to shorten it to just 'mew'. Then we can shorten 'mbit' from 'em-bit' to 'ems'.

I think 'µBTC', 'µbit', 'ubit' and 'uBTC' are equally good. They accurately convey their meaning to the listener without the confusion that 'bit' can cause.

Not true. 10 millibit could mean either 0.010BTC or 1 satoshi. If you would like to send me 10 millibits (=0.010BTC), I will send you back 10 millibits to demonstrate.

Oh, it should be? According to you? Nonsense. Please show me an academic paper published in a reputable peer reviewed journal that contains data showing that government spending shouldn't be included in GDP, or even more preposterously, that it removes from GDP. You won't find any because there is plenty of data which shows the opposite, that most types of government spending in first world countries have an economic multiplier greater than 1, as is the case in the US. In fact, the only types of government spending that are consistently measured with a multiplier less than 1, are tax cuts, much to the dismay of libertarians/republicans.

How much is a millibit?
Currently this means 0.001 BTC. If we now start calling the microbit 'bit', then a millibit would mean 0.001 bit, or 0.1 Satoshi. This is real confusion, not in the least bit 'contrived'.
Call it something else that will not create confusion with the currently used conventions.
@_date: 2014-05-03 10:16:01


Let's rename them 'liters'.


rename these 'meters'


rename these 'grams'
Wow, this is easier. I've changed my mind, renaming 'microbits' to 'bits' is a great idea!
@_date: 2014-05-03 18:04:45


You can't just assume that people will stop using millibit. I certainly won't, it's a great name that means exactly what it sounds like it does, i.e. it is one thousandths of a bitcoin. Now, how will we explain to new users that a 'millibit' is 1000 times bigger than a 'bit'? 
millibit &gt; bit is completely counter-intuitive.


No clue, but I wish they would join the discussion rather than downvoting anything they don't agree with.
@_date: 2014-04-25 23:23:54
It is already very common for people to refer to 0.001BTC as a 'millibit'. You can't now decide that you are going to call a microbitcoin a 'bit'. This would create confusion because now a 'millibit' could refer to either 0.001BTC or 0.000000001BTC.
This is an incredibly stupid and shortsighted idea. Call it something else if you feel that the metric system is too complicated for you and you believe that uBTC needs a nickname.

Yes, which is why people need to stop using 'bits'. It conflicts with the already in frequent use conventions that we have. We can't have a system where people use 'millibit' to mean a value that is 1000x greater than 'bit'. This is so mind bendingly stupid, I'm fearful my head might explode.

There are 120,000 people subscribed to this subreddit, and you continue to make generalizations based on a handful of people. Your posts are full of insults and trolling, and you then complain that you receive trolling/insulting replies and downvotes in return. An embarrassingly large number of your posts involve calling someone 'kid', 'child', 'boy', '14 year old', etc. Seriously, get a new schtick and at least show a little creativity in your trolling. You are voluntarily sitting at the kids table, acting like a child, and all the while complaining that you are surrounded by kids.
And btw, most people here are not kids. Check any of the survey results that have been done over the years. Most people here are adults with above average education and technical knowledge. They just choose not to engage in conversation with you.

You will never get everyone to agree on 'bits'. Personally, I will never refer to a microbitcoin as a 'bit'. I know there are others that feel the same way and they have posted in this thread and the other dozen we've had over the last week to that effect. Now, I am willing to compromise on 'ubit', because it actually makes sense and is a logical choice. I will never agree to call them 'bits'. If the 'bit' supporters aren't willing to compromise, then fuck them for choosing a name that would essentially force the rest of us to change.

A soft fork is when previously-valid blocks become invalid.
I don't believe this is correct. In the second case, this could still cause the blockchain to fork as the previous versions would create blocks not accepted by the newer version. The miners using the previous version would still try to build on this chain, which would not be recognized by the rest of the network. I think anything that changes the validity of blocks constitutes a hard fork.

You will still get the coins at the price you paid. They just hold them to make sure you can't issue a chargeback immediately after receiving the coins.

I did my phd in theoretical physics and my research has application in quantum information and quantum computing, and I'm well versed on the subject. No one has a true universal quantum computer. The technology is at least 10 years away, being very optimistic. The only computer which is at all quantum in nature is an adiabatic quantum computer which is made by the company D-Wave. Their quantum computer can not break cryptography and is completely worthless on such problems. This is fundamental to their design. Their computer is good at optimization problems like the traveling salesman problem or protein folding.
And even when we do have universal quantum computers, they won't be able to crack bitcoin's encryption UNLESS an address has already been used once and thus the private key has already been used to sign a transaction. So when universal quantum computers do come out, don't reuse addresses until the bitcoin protocol is hardened against quantum computing.

Whenever bitcoin starts to rise exponentially, litecoin takes a massive dive as people pull their money out and get it back into btc.

Litecoin is massively overpriced at the moment. It was under $2 about 3 weeks ago. It is now over $30. It made this rise on absolutely no news, no new adoption, nothing. I would wait until it crashes back to $5-10 before considering buying any litecoin.
Bitcoin seems pretty stable at 850-900. I think this is a fair price considering all of the positive press it has received in the last month. I don't know if the next growth spurt will start before New Years, but I suspect it will be sooner than most people expect.

Although it may seem the network mines bitcoins "out of thin air", what the miners are actually doing is securing a ledger which contains every bitcoin transaction that has ever occurred. The mining process is a very clever way in which the network can reach consensus on a single history of transactions. It is a essentially a race to find a needle in a haystack and the winner of each round gets to write the next block of transactions into the ledger. The winner of each round is awarded a prize of bitcoin (currently 25 bitcoins and this number is reduced by half every 4 years). This prize is incentive for the miners to secure the ledger (which is called the blockchain) and to verify that the transactions are valid. This is all done with some very complex cryptography.
Mining bitcoins is highly competitive and the people that mine spend thousands of dollars on specialized computers to do so. It's not like it's free money. Many people actually lose money trying to mine bitcoin because it's so competitive these days.
