I agree with you. This “compromise” stuff in marriages is just weird. I’m not married but if my wife is making decisions then something is wrong with me. My wife doesn’t decide what I spend money on if I think its a good idea

Was there any fee besides the miners fee?

The private keys would be based on social security number and name. If the system becomes popular enough people could vote to have a different system of registry. I would set the system up with legal names and social security numbers only as a way to make sure nobody has 2 votes while other people have 1. This can be migrated away from later, or if I come up with a better idea, but this one would work perfectly. The social security number wouldn't have any real value, but nobody in the US has 2 different numbers corresponding to 1 name, so it'd be a good way to stop illegitimate registration.

Right! 10000 bitcoin used to buy 1 pizza &amp; now 10000 can buy you an island haha. Bitcoin is a new technology, it has no limits! It can easily go up that much again

Did you read my first paragraph? 
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:24:53
This is not communism. This is the complete opposite of communism. The only similarity is the idea of it being "for the people". There is no distribution of wealth whatsoever.

Is it effective? How do they sift through the possible spam?

If the system is decided to require a 2/3 vote for any law to be passed then thats what will be implemented. I am only providing a baseline to start with. Afterwards the system will go wherever people want it to go.

Read the first paragraph that I wrote. It's like 2 sentences long.

Everyone allowed to vote has a SS#

Yeah it was the wrong way to say it. I called it communism referring to the idea of it being "for the people", but nothing else would be the same you are right. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:29:31
Exactly. The whole point of it is to give 100% control to the people.

Like I pointed out this system would be entirely customizable. I haven't thought much about how certain things would be implemented but I have thought of your point about too many laws being proposed. I could create an AI that finds key words in many different proposals and brings them together in a way that doesn't get rid of anything in each specific proposal, but joins excess words that are just different ways of saying something already proposed by many people. When you make a proposal, the system would then give you a pop up prompt that connects your idea to another unifying idea already proposed, and if the prompt it came up with is exactly what you said but just stated in a different way, you'd sign off on it and ask it to add your proposal into the already established proposal that unifies the different semantics of different people. This AI would only get more accurate over time as well, and I'm sure an AI like this already exists anyway. The proposals stated the most would be put on the top of a list, with diminishing popularity as the list goes down. In this way, literally every single citizen would have a part in exactly what gets put into law. As for enforcement of things like raising taxes, the blockchain would very easily remedy this, in an even better way than the IRS can. You are aware of the public ledger on Bitcoin so here's how I would propose it works. Don't get stuck up on the exact things I'm saying. Like I said, any idea I'm putting forward could be changed, or certain parts could be omitted, like giving your social security number or something. Here's one idea. Every single citizen puts in their full, legal name, their social security number, and then a random string of 30 characters. You can just spam your keyboard with characters, it doesn't matter. The system then hashes all 3 of these data points into a private key. Every person with the same name would have a different key because of the social security number input and 30 random characters, but even without inputting social security numbers, the 30 random characters would make decrypting of the individual keys into names very difficult (I wouldn't say impossible because you never know). The social security part is only to make sure everyone signing up corresponds to 1 person. The 30 random characters would act as the determinstic value to arrive at your private key, so even if someone got your private key, you could just change it with the 30 character string. Adding social security numbers would add extra security to the system because you would need the 30 characters and your social security number to have control over your private key. Ok, now that I pointed that out, this is how a law such as raising taxes would be enforced. All the public keys would be shown on the blockchain, and all income would be sent to your public key. Once the time for collecting taxes came along, every individual would remove the amount of taxes owed from their wallet. If someone paid less than they owe, this would be clear because the amount of income received would show. If the person refuses to pay, this public key would become sort of an outlaw, and if you are employing this public key user, you would see that they did not pay their taxes, and do whatever you want with that information. In essence, through some mechanism, your public and private keys would be private, so the way to pay someone would be through the way you pay them now: their name and social security number. The only purpose of the public key would be to have transparent elections and transparent laws. The issue of people's income being public knowledge can be easily circumvented. If you wanted a graduated income tax like there is in the US, you could just weigh all values in each bracket the same, and make sure someone is paying the correct percentage of their income, not the correct value. If you wanted flat income tax, it would be even easier because each person would just output the correct percentage of their income, without any reason to know their bracket. Income bracket is already basically public knowledge because you can see each persons material possessions. I don't know how private cryptos like Monero work but the mechanism used by them could also be implemented to have complete privacy, as well as a trust that each person is only voting 1 time.

US Citizens are. I'm trying to think of a way every person could only vote once.

If thats what the people want. Yeah I would create a template, try to start an ecosystem where people can hold stake in it so it has some weight to begin with, and additionally hold an offline replica of the online version in case it gets taken down at any point, and then I'd just re upload the replica version. I want to create something called a "developer box", where I put myself in the developer box, and then ask for tokens of this specific blockchain in order to run it, so that I can make a living while I code it. If people don't want me to create it, they can just stop paying me. The person in the developer position would have direct access to the root of the code, and nodes that hold a stake would be receive a prompt to update their node if they like the code I put forward, but I would only have control in the sense that the developer box is decided by the majority to exist. If they cut it out, there's nothing I can do, and I would set up a replica version if people liked my version of it more than the majorities. The only thing I would do is hold a save of it so I can re upload a version in case the public version is corrupted. I'll allow people to recreate their own version in any way they want.

The blockchain would get rid of the need for a government.

An AI algorithm that unifies redundant points made by different people.
@_date: 2019-01-05 05:29:23
True, but another aspect of my system would be to allow everyone to propose laws, and then using AI laws that are worded different would be conglomerated into 1 unifying law, and this would be done for all suggestions that anyone suggests.
