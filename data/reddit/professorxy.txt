I like impersonation of the state as a shark. It is defiantly and boldly

When I sell an apple colored coin what happens to the coin when the apple is eaten? Does the time-stamp just act like a receipt?

OMG! How many unnecessary things they do. Waiting for good times when it won't take much time to pay.

Sure, it would be nice if a future bitcoin sidechain or treechain had faster confirmations for everyday purchases but this image develops its humor by misleading the audience.

This is a joke! 
But I think it is strange joke

Again! People don't believe in BTC as they are scared about it. There is no symptom to tell that it is likely to be short-lived.

There's nothing amazing here that volatility is going down. This trend we can see cause of the market's growing.

Great news! For me this discount is a surprise also, but I like it.

NOW I NEED TO DO THE SAME THING! It's the same thing as if they ask not to look down when you're are climbing up

Additionally, there re many other ways to confirm without having to wait 7-10 minutes with BTC. A coinbase to coinbase transaction or a circle to circle transaction is instantly confirmed as fraud is prevented through KYC.

I'm a farmer and have 100 apples. Am i correct in that I can issue 100 shares for my apples?

How much does the Fed charge for freshly minted coins?
Pretty sure it's nothing above face value... not sure why bitcoins would be different.

Sign! That's the best post I've read this month. I don't like to read bad articles about BTC but still it's better to have bad pr than nothing.

Well, it seems to be more commercial than just supporting of bitcoins. Though that's better to read than "Cash only"

That isn't what he is arguing...maybe watch the video?
