You can try twitter, but chances are they'll just tell you to email support.  It'd be nice to know when people who are getting credited sent their initial support request so we have a better guess at how long until they get to us.

If you check 50btc.com, Top 10 MH/S under user's, you'll see BFL. Feel good knowing when you get your miner it'll probably be used. Realized it today after my shares rate dropped by significantly maybe 2 days ago.

At this point, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt until the end of Monday. I could have written a program in an hour that would have scanned the support emails for trigger words, verified that they purchased between x-y, made the adjustments. I'm assuming that the glitch left them with no indication of who got screwed, so they're doing it all manually via the support emails. At the end of the day though, they should have sandboxed this 'feature' before trying it.

If he got them the 11th, theres a good chance he ordered monday. So he would have gotten them at the bottom of the drop. Basically if he bought 1 bitcoin monday it would have been maybe $190, instead received the same amount he ordered at the previous price. The same problem everyone is having right now. We didn't get the future price even though we opted in.

I contacted them ~17 hours ago, still waiting for any kind of response back. You'd think they'd take 4 minutes and make a blog post about the issue since they took the time to say 'hey we hired somebody.' 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:22:10
yeah I went ahead and screen capped what their little lightbox form "How much bitcoin will I recieve?" in case they miraculously decide to change it. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:29:49
It's back up, may only show up when they're 'out' of btc to sell or are currently holding. Still waiting to get a response. Guessing they must have gotten majorly backlogged after that 'glitch' 
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:58:47
I just looked and they removed it completely. Are they still showing one for you? [heres my screen cap]( for future reference. In another thread, someone says they got a recalculated BTC when BTC went up [here check MockingJ's]( post here.
  
Also OP [here]( says he got an email saying it was pegged not at the amount but the exchange rate of the transaction (future date).
  
Hopefully we can get the references all together in one thread. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:09:08
Same boat, clearly says that its pegged at the USD for market value at the time they make the transaction. Sent an email, no response. Blew $200+ on a $99 coin that was intended to be used for a transaction, can't even make the purchase now until they get their shit together.

Just got mine, you should be getting cleared up soon (if you havent)
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:04:38
Yer, I suspect their inbox blew up from people sending multiple emails. This apparently became a problem on Wednesday, so that means a full 24 hours of complaints.
  
In the future, I'd imagine a better tactic to curb this would be a priority system done by creating support categories for the email forms. That way you can just sort out general questions (lower priority) and deal with the major issues. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:51:15
Any chance you can get a screen cap of that e-mail (ms paint out any personal information) for some of us who have also been bad-touched by coinbase? 
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:12:40
Same as Hemingway, ~41 hours now since I emailed about it Friday. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:56:11
chips, chips everywhere!
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:14:29
guessing you have to contact, at the 48 mark after emailing and still haven't been credited. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:42:45
Keep us updated, if you hear anything. Going to be trolling this thread all night and a few others. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:25:27
yeah, at this point I'd rather just deal with p2p purchases from people I trust rather than dealing with this. If coinbase is having issues coding something as simple as this, I really don't trust them being attached to my bank account. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:01:10
Basically if it's in their favor to sell to you at a given price, they will, else 'you're high risk.'
