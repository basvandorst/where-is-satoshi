I disagree. There's a lot of support at the 5500 level, and we've bounced off it quite clearly. I think the correction is over, now it's consolidation and then onto a new high.

ITT: Republicans vs democrats. The pushover democrats are saying that it's "toxic" to fight against oppressors and they just want to move on so that we can continue to be attacked year after year by these same clowns, and the republicans are pushing for repercussions. There's no escaping the two party politics, not even in Bitcoin.

This isn't something people want, it isn't something people need and it's already been done years ago -- it's called PoS. The fact that Bitcoin costs so much energy to create is a part of the reason it is so valuable. Take that away and it becomes a gimmick.

I think it'd be wiser to better optimize the wallet apps so they can all fit. My main gripes are software related, not hardware related, and most of them just come down to poor design decisions (the seed phrase confirmation especially). If they fixed their software and design decisions the device would be amazing.

This is the Ethereum pumper guy. Ethereum has far more political problems than Bitcoin does, for example the constant bickering about hard forking to recover lost funds by third party companies who can't write secure smart contracts because Solidity is a terrible language.

They're VERY wealthy, all they need to do is throw money at COMPETENT developers. The problem is all of their existing developers suck balls. They need to restructure and hire people with a brain. The platform was obviously built on terrible foundations, and probably needs a mostly-rewrite. They could also consider reaching out to good exchanges like Gemini and Bitfinex and asking them for help, because both of those exchanges can handle extremely high loads.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:04:33
You're either an absolute drop-dead naive and gullible moron, or you're involved with them. They called it off because not only was it their intent to profit from insider trading, but it was obvious that it was going to fail. It had no support.

Not sure how that conveys that? "Choose a variable length PIN" would have done the job. I suspect it's actually to backspace (for the X) and an alternative to hitting both buttons at the same time to go next (for the tick). Limitations of the small screen size and only two buttons can make things like that tricky, understandably.

Miners, what's the counter argument here?
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:13:45
Thanks for addressing my points.
In regard to point 1 and 2, my complaints were unfounded given how the device works and I think it's fine (provided that it's impossible for anyone to install malicious firmware on the device successfully).


I'm well aware, and I did so, but it's trivial for you guys to throw in an extra card and it's something that your customers would appreciate. I'm sure you want to make a good first impression, little things matter.


The problem is that it's trivial to reverse engineer the pin with only a microphone if it is not scrambled, so to say it's more secure is not factual. It's more secure at one thing but not the other.


Well it should either specify that the following check is inadequate or it should go over every word. The problem is that currently it is worded so that you think it's going to guide you through a process to check you have written down the correct words but then only partially does it. This is something that should be easy for you to fix in many ways, either through clearer wording, or by changing the process. Thanks for the tool link though.


Fair enough, that actually makes a lot of sense. I'll retract that complaint too then.


That's subjective. If you're a day trader who frequently deals with lots of altcoins it's not a minor hassle at all, it's a major hassle. Good to hear that you're fixing it though.

This should be the default setting and non-changeable. Why are they allowing people to compromise their own security? Good to know though, thank you.


That's cool. I didn't mean to sound so negative, but I was quite frustrated with how the experience ended up (in part because my experiences with the Trezor were so smooth). Lots of little things that shouldn't be happening and it just makes me ask why, seems like lost potential. I was really hoping it would be on point because of the things I've heard about the chip security and the fact it supports more coins, but was left disappointed. I think both companies could learn a lot from each other, it's a shame they don't seem to be working together or learning lessons.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:39:37
Yeah, all this is going to lead to is a PoW change and maybe a change to the difficulty adjustment algorithm. Miners are shafting themselves without even realizing it, it's hilarious.

The hardware isn't great, it can't store a sufficient number of apps (pretty ironic for something shaped like a USB flash drive) and the software is horrible. Buggy, unintuitive mess. Their secure element is good, but that's about it. Worth the price? That's subjective.

The mempool is being spammed, increasing the blocksize will solve nothing because they'll just spam it harder. What we really need is an alternative technical solution. Lightning Network is one of them, but it's still a while away. That's why I'm interested in projects like IOTA, their approach is vastly different and so they have no fees and no scaling issues, they also don't have miners so miner centralization is not a problem either. Unfortunately for Bitcoin it's too much of a radical change to adopt the technology used in IOTA, but perhaps there's a middleground the Bitcoin devs could look at.

I'm not shilling anything, I'm making a comparison of an inferior product to a better one. It's useful for people who are considering buying a hardware wallet, especially considering that Ledger just don't even tell you that you're only going to be able to use about 3 of their wallets at a time. Very relevant information for someone who trades or diversifies across a lot of altcoins.


No, they don't.

Also:  -- No magic is required to survey people, and no magic is required to correlate social media account information. There's also this thing called google that collects this sort of information and correlates it to search queries and referrals.

@_date: 2017-09-25 12:01:33
This is a misconception that is constantly repeated in here: "If nobody purchases anything with bitcoin, bitcoin will become worthless." -- It's simply not true, because people are *constantly* purchasing things with Bitcoin, and that is fiat. And fiat holders are purchasing Bitcoin. This is a closed loop and it's enough to sustain the system, no external purchases are necessary at all.
It does however increase the value of the coin faster than it would otherwise if people use it to purchase things because then vendors will be more likely to accept it, which means more people see it as a payment option, which means that it spreads awareness and advertising of the currency. Without advertising, the growth would be slower, but over time it'd even out.

The only reason the chart spiked was because Ver was spamming the network trying to push BCH and 2x. The fees are currently at 2.5 avg:  -- Chart looks perfectly reasonable when the network isn't being attacked. It was also before SegWit, which had a positive effect on the fees. If anthing the charts prove that solutions will be found in time before we see even close to $20 fees. There's a 100% success rate at the moment, so I'm not sure why you're so confident in something that has never been demonstrated.
You're also making assumptions that reasonable solutions won't be found. Once lightning network wallets are finished (we've already seen beta clients) and they're in widespread use the fees will drop even further because thousands of off-chain transactions will equate to a single on-chain transaction, displacing the effect you're speaking of.

Thanks miners, I didn't realize you were in this for the good of Bitcoin. I thought for some odd reason that you mined coins to make a profit. I guess I've been wrong all this time! Thanks for donating your hashpower, you philanthropic saints!

Personally I'd rather just wait for them to fork and dump their coins on the market when I get them for free money. If I didn't hold Bitcoin then I'd agree though. I don't think Core should be helping these scum sabotage Bitcoin. Let the scumbags put out terrible software, no one will use it, they'll exterminate themselves.

No one that matters. The whales already know what this is all about. The whole point of 2x is to make a killing off noobs through fear tactics and speculators through marketing. It's already an obvious failure already because these clownhats can't execute for shit. No one with any significant stake is taking it seriously. Not even the people behind it are taking it seriously.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:30:15


They don't need to if nodes are cheap and easy to run. It can be a philanthropic service and function just fine. If they become expensive that possibility diminishes rapidly.


How long is a piece of string?


What makes you think transaction fees will ever be $20? You're predicting something that is yet to happen, and probably never will happen. It's not a great argument.

You're the dumb one in this conversation. Willing to throw all your money away on a whim and live a non-materialistic life IS a non-materialistic endeavor. If he strikes it rich then he can change that later, if not then it doesn't matter, he's already living a non-materialistic lifestyle and it works fine for him and his family. He's instilling the values that there is much more to life than money, and taking big risks in life is what makes it worth living. You on the other hand seem to idolize being a pussy. That's your choice, but don't call other people out just because you lack testicles.

They have good security and honest staff, but I must admit it's awfully slow and frustrating to use. Only stick around because I feel I can trust them though, and their business relies on that. If they were shit to deal with or untrustworthy I gaurantee not even a single person would use Kraken.

They won't be "owning" anything, even if they do it. Just because they mine it doesn't mean people will use it or buy it.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:35:50
This will always remain a hurdle for adoption, the "I need a full coin" misunderstanding. Hell, even for the people who know they don't need to buy a full coin they still have this as a psychological barrier because "what's the point if you can't even have a full coin". We need to move to a new unit of accounting, but it's been said a million times and to coordinate it, it will probably never happen.

@_date: 2017-09-25 11:50:04
It is. Doesn't matter, Bitcoin will never go anywhere, it will be like gold, gold is no longer the barter currency but it's still incredibly valuable and has other niche uses. It will probably be used for really big purchases like housing and cars too though, because it can be done easily over the internet. Bitcoin is the modern gold. 
It could be embraced on a society level on a global scale as a 'master currency' but it would be very experimental to attempt this form of governance for such an important purpose. It's largely untested, and if someone bad finds a way to infiltrate it through political measures then it could have massive repercussions on a society. 
We know how dirty the federal reserve is, but these people (the economist et al) are bankers, they have no problem with the federal reserve and think they're doing a fine job. So it's not surprising to see them push for a privately controlled blockchain. I think it boils down to politics and older less-risk averse and already in power people failing to embrace it. If the people embrace it though, it may not even matter in the end. If Bitcoin proves to be a great candidate for it then it will happen through the natural order of things, even if those in power resist it. It may be a bumpy ride though.

Not only are you stupid, but you're terrible at math too. If only 10% of the community is pro-2x then they're definitely not maintaining a 1-to-1 ratio. I feel like I'm educating a toddler. Typical 2x supporter I guess.
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:07:25
This is how the Bitcoin vs 2x battle is going to go.
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:57:31


History repeats itself. This is how the world works, you should know this by now. Boycotts are nothing new, and if you think predicting a boycott over 2x support is unrealistic then I'd argue that you're not paying attention to the current state of the community. It's an easy to predict and very likely outcome, and if I'm doing it then others will be too, because I'm a moderate and there are a LOT of extremists in this community.


Yeah, but they don't have money. The Saudi's are wealthy and already have all the money, the crypto businesses WANT money. Besides, this statement is wrong anyway, the Saudi's have a ton of rep from the people who put them in positions of power and wealth. They're the only people that matter in the eyes of the Saudi's, not the "common folk".

I know a guy who did this and is now a multi-millionaire. Only jealous people say "this is stupid". Just because you didn't have the balls to put it all on the line doesn't mean someone else's decision is dumb. At the end of the day, money is money, and there is more to life than it, so losing it all is not the end of the world.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:51:31
If you think you're going to get coins for 3-4k you're dreaming. The 2x fork is actually bullish because people want to duplicate their coins. It's also bullish because we already know it's going to be a failure, and so you're already buying coins on the cheap from the people who are "scared". I won't be selling any time soon, and all other whales won't be either. Agree on the rest of what you said though.

@_date: 2017-10-29 22:29:48
Pretty high that it won't dip. If anything it'll go up as people want to double their coins, and then people will dump their 2x for Bitcoin pushing it up even further.

You'd know it to be true if you left your mothers basement and spoke to people in the real world. People keep stating it because it happens, obviously. It's not a matter of not understanding fractional values, it's a matter of not understanding that Bitcoin supports them.

You realize that by making it public you have zero chance of profiting off it right? That's if it even yields any useful results. I'm inclined to believe it won't, considering this has been done countless times before with unimpressive results:

That's not Bitcoin's biggest advantage at all... That's not even slightly important. People buy and hold Bitcoin more than they sell it, or the price wouldn't go up. Bitcoin's killer use case is a digital store of value, and every altcoin will severely struggle to displace that because it is largely a result of first mover advantage. There's a reason gold wasn't replaced by platinum.

Nah, it's good, the more retarded copycats there are the less steam they have.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:26:50
Sure. It's actually quite easy. First thing you want to do is move all of your Bitcoins to a new Bitcoin wallet. This is a security precaution in case there's any dodgy happenings with the BCH client, if they manage to steal your private key somehow (unlikely, but still), then your Bitcoins wont be affected. 
Then you need to download Electron Cash ( Then you need to restore your old Bitcoin wallets private keys (not your new wallet) into Electron Cash. The private keys you import will be from the wallet that was holding your Bitcoins at the time of the fork a few weeks back or whenever it was.
Once you've imported your priv key it's just a matter of sending the BCH to an exchange and selling it.
As for importing the private key, how you do that depends on what Bitcoin client you currently use. That's probably the hardest part of it all. Would need to know your client first before I could elaborate further on this part, there are probably lots of guides online too.
The way to visualize what's happening here is: You had Bitcoin, a forked network was created, so now your private key that holds your Bitcoin also works on the BitcoinCash network and has an equivalent value of BitcoinCash. You move your Bitcoins to a new Bitcoin wallet, but on the BitcoinCash network nothing has moved, so now your old wallet (at the time of the fork) still holds your BCH on the BCH network, and your new wallet holds your Bitcoin. You've now separated them securely. Hope that makes sense.
Shitty diagram I made to help illustrate: 
As you can see, moving coins from the original wallet (wallet 1) to a new wallet (wallet 2) on the Bitcoin fork does not affect the BCH fork.
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:08:12
You'd think that, but it's not the case. 8/10 people I've talked to about Bitcoin don't realize they can buy a fraction. It's because of the "coin" part, you can't divide a coin in half. (Well, you can, but it wouldn't be a very good coin anymore).
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:52:11

No. That would be guesswork. You have no idea if hardware is going to become cheaper over time forever, and if you're referring to Moore's Law it's already been demonstrated to be dead.


It's called balance. When the network isn't being spammed and attacked by the same group of retards trying to attack Bitcoin with 2x the fees are perfectly reasonable.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:24:00

Forks are things you eat your dinner with.
Serious though: There's an upcoming fork, you don't need to do anything, just hold your coins and you'll be fine. If the fork maintains value you may even get some free coins out of it.

I don't think you know what inferring means. I'm not making stuff up, I'm speaking on my behalf and on the behalf of people who have already said the same thing before. If you don't have the same internal motives then good for you? BTW, if you think boycotts don't work then look at Sea World's stock lmfao. Just having a good product is not necessarily enough to keep you afloat, especially when products are easily replaced by competition since you can't patent a website idea.
