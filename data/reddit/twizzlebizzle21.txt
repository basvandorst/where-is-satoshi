I've had nothing but issues.  I bought some with my debit card the other day.  The payment failed, so I tried again and it failed.
  
Next morning my bank is missing the money and I have the bitcoins.  I bought twice as much from 2 "failed" transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-26 19:57:20
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:46:16
If I remember my username and password but that app stops working on the Airbitz goes down, how do I retrieve my BTC?
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:37:16
Especially at this time.
@_date: 2016-06-28 13:52:56
I just mean there's a bug and the app physically won't let me buy anything.
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:00:07
Do I have to backup the seed each time the balance changes or once it's backed up it updates automatically from the blockchain?
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:00:34
Thank you.
I might just message you!  I'm at work at the moment.  
  
The security is something I want to worry about when I start purchasing more and more.
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:18:47
Authy is the bomb.
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:02:45
Jesus.  I've just bought my first $10 and was happy. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 21:37:06
How much we talking?
@_date: 2016-06-20 12:10:30
If I'm moving transactions from 1 address to another for personal reasons and time isn't of the essence.  What's the lowest fee that will still eventually be included?
@_date: 2016-06-29 06:23:43
No that's fine, just seems a bit deceitful.  I only noticed cos I was buying a rounded figure.
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:07:15
I've been thinking about what you said and looking at these paperwallets.  
  
How secure is Coinbase?  I am buying small amounts but planning on transferring 1BTC to a paperwallet each time I aquire one.  Is this acceptable practise and is coinbase safe enough to hoard by BTC while it's sub 1BTC?  I have 2Factor Auth and a strong password.
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:10:11
Thanks dude! I appreciate it!
Enjoy your day!
@_date: 2016-06-28 14:38:30
I thought they made there money on just putting their rates higher and not then putting them up again when you buy?
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:11:48
Which app? /Widget?
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:50:34
Well after a fair amount of research once I reach each full bitcoin i'm going to transfer to a paper wallet.  I've also found an android app that allows you to have the private keys and back them up (AirBitz).  
  
Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:56:57
They can maybe crack Bitcoin...
@_date: 2016-06-28 14:28:27
The app shows the price on the left as the Bitcoin price. Then the price on the right is the price they are trying to sell me at.  Why doesn't it match their market price when it's a fee free service?  
  
Edit: the lower rate on the left is already higher than most other markets.
@_date: 2016-06-23 09:55:31
Will buy this.
How often does it update?
@_date: 2016-06-20 11:59:25
What happened at the last halvening?  How did the miners deal with the reduced reward?
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:25:06
I did the same.  Luckily not a huge amount 
@_date: 2016-06-23 09:53:29
Mines okay but it's been very slow update transactions yesterday.
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:10:26
Doesn't work at my place unfortunately.  Huge place that processes tons of salaries.
@_date: 2016-06-19 18:54:28
@_date: 2016-06-28 21:56:14
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:33:58
Im confused now. Cheers!
@_date: 2016-06-20 11:55:59
Newbie here.  Why is the block size an issue?  I see it mentioned a lot.  
  
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:16:45
Can someone explain why circle is better?
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:06:09
Ahh makes sense!
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:33:23
If you buy and sell keep it in one.
I wanted to sell earlier and by the time I got 4 confirmations with Circle the price was a fair bit worse so I've held off.
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:55:41
I bought my first BTC last night....  already lost £60. Nice.
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:17:35
Worth having some just incase?
@_date: 2016-06-23 22:26:23
Interesting.  That's a lot of BTC. Do we know if it's a single bidder?
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:34:18
Late reply but.  I'm fairly new.  I have a small amount on CoinBase, how am I supposed to back this up?  Can this be done with CoinBase itself?
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:37:53
I'd sell enough to recoup initial investment and hold the rest til after the halving.
@_date: 2016-06-23 09:54:05
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:46:43
Yeah I like that.  
  
Whenever I want to look at the data I want it up to date!  Maybe make a tutorial or something so people know to double click refresh...
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:05:19
This happened to me today...
  
  
Normally circle transactions are the next block.  It took hours today.
@_date: 2016-06-20 12:55:10
So to scale we need bigger blocks or faster block release?
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:39:21
I bought some Eth at the low.  Going to transfer them to BTC when BTC is down and Eth is up!
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:22:41
I'm not worried.  Was kidding around.
@_date: 2016-06-28 13:59:36
Will they really though?
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:59:37
So if I transfer my BTC from coinbase to there and backup the seed that would be better than just leaving them on coinbase?
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:41:12
Sync frequency of the widget would be nice?
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:55:20
Not sure how or what this guy did but I'd move them to a new wallet just incase.
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:08:32
Circle.  The app actually works and they don't charge fees.
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:51:04
U wot
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:10:29
Any good Android App Wallet thats designed well/functional and importantly I control the keys?  
  
Currently using CoinBase.
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:38:40
Get your coins in your own wallet boys.
@_date: 2016-06-21 17:27:24
Use Circle, i'd also take them out of Circle and into your own wallet where you hold the private keys.  
  
Circle is great for buying bitcoin, not so much storing it.
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:23:50
Do you mean a physical paper wallet?
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:56:57
For $100 worth of Bitcoin?  Probably better just generating some paper wallets if he wants to hang onto it.
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:00:19


@_date: 2016-06-21 11:00:08
Sell and buy when it goes down further?
@_date: 2016-06-19 21:16:29
I'm hoping for a drop just after so I can drop many monies then a sharp rise.
@_date: 2016-06-27 21:16:03
I can't even buy.
It stays in USD and then doesn't update and actually let me buy anything...
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:00:15
I'd rather wait for a full release.  Looks good though!  
@_date: 2016-06-21 21:23:11
I have 0.000008 in my coinbase...
@_date: 2016-06-26 19:56:06
Any idea on a release?
@_date: 2016-06-19 19:50:23
We wish.
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:28:46
Appropriate backup procedures?  Downloaded Airbitz.
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:58:06
I'm waiting for sub £400 before I take a big punt.
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:21:17
Probably 3-4 for me.
@_date: 2016-06-17 08:45:38
Okay thanks for the write up!  I'll look into it!  Is keeping it in coinbase etc really not that safe?   
  
@_date: 2016-06-20 12:32:43
So every transaction being included in that 10 mins will fit into a 1mb file?  
  
  
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:36:35
It's a market.  Sellers set their own price.  
  
If you're higher risk they can get away setting a lower price as people have less options.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:26:35
I've used it numerous times and I always pick the high feedback sellers.
  
You might be okay without ID verification but you'll be subjecting yourself to more risk and a worse exchange rate.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:55:47
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:51:43
Not in the UK for bank transfers.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:20:41
Breadwallet is shit on android.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:14:51
I once clicked through the list of bitcoin private keys and found one that had 3BTC spent this year.
  
I wouldn't call that cracked.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:32:03
Who cares.  Both do different jobs and have value in different areas.  Multiple currency can coexist.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:30:26
I bought at $1850.  Nice...
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:33:43
I knew about it from the very early days.  I never mined early on as it had no value at all. I never bought in early on because A) I was poor and B) it's a currency, I don't hold lots of USD just incase its value increases.  I've bought bitcoin numerous times to use (I bought 1BTC to fund a Usenet server).  
  
Now I hold a small amount as I'm more wealthy, understand the technology more and understand the implications.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:32:27
Shrodingers bitcoin.  
 
  
Any point in the past seemed both too late and not early enough.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:38:50
I keep it stored on Google drive, encrypted and printed wallet file with a password.  
  
I then have the password on my password manager which is covered by my Google password, 2 factor and then the passworddatabase decryption password.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:22:16
But bitcoin is higher than its ever been...
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:17:02
I went to sell some LTC and buy ETH through them and the buy and sell fee was wild.  
 Much cheaper to.use shapeshift.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:41:30
It's only bad because you've backed the wrong horse it seems.  
  
I hold both for this reason.  I believe in BTC more but the way it's held back isn't exactly a positive.
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:37:56
I've not bought today but last week it was cheaper than coinbase...
  
It must be due to the recent price drop, it's not always that big of a differential.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:48:06
I've used localbitcoins three times with no problems at all.  Just choose reputable sellers.
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:07:37
Few safer options without getting into hardware wallets imo.  
  
Decent phone app where you have the seed to restore the wallet.  
  
Paper wallet stored somewhere very safe.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:43:56
A few years ago I used a bar in London that accepted BTC for beer.  
  
Transaction fee would be more than the beer now.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:54:20
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:41:38
Don't buy at Ath, how we supposed to know bro.
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:05:32
  
Not a direct answer but very interesting.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:26:39
You still have 1/25 of a bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:00:10
I asked my mum and she replied "shut up, what do you want for tea?"
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:29:44
I did that.  The amount I have invested I can easily afford to lose but I'm a little obsessed.
  
I'm well up and since I moved to paper wallets I've chilled more
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:52:41
I don't hate anyone, that's a bit silly over this.  
  
I just feel that Ethereum currently has a brighter future, more prospects (for different reasons).  Eth might cause BTC to crash and it might be the other way round.  
  
You got to adapt to survive.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:57:21
The fact these threads keep popping up on here, suggests it's the other way around.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:48:10
Yes but you have to lock away value...   You're still spending.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:53:57
Can I ask why you think that?  
  
You're still locking value away into the system to be able to confirm transactions.  Also locking value away will also have a deflation effect?
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:40:04
I had an eth wallet in my attic that I swept ages ago...  £9 with 5Ether on it...
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:49:56
Local bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-07-04 09:48:41
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:08:21
A bad thing for who though?
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:42:41
Is it secure?
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:03:53
Not in the UK :(
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:14:39
Do you expect some of the gold share to move into crypto?
@_date: 2016-07-17 20:02:43
I bought in at a point where £510 makes me break even!  Feels good that it's £516 right now in haha.
@_date: 2016-07-06 10:56:16
Whenever I've moved from circle to my AirBitz wallet I've paid no fee from my balance.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:14:34
Kind of.  
  
Not my main savings but I tend to keep 10% in Bitcoin, still using standard affairs for my majority savings.
@_date: 2016-07-11 22:08:14
Any idea when a full release is coming?  
  
I'd like to move some more funds than just playing about with it! Looks great thanks!
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:13:36
Steam sales &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2016-07-07 19:37:42
Mines a couple of months and limited to 0.38... BTC via debit card.  I've requested and increase.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:36:29
Crap reviews, questionable security, not updated often, poor features.  
  
Use mycelium imo.
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:25:44
At the moment I buy small amounts on Circle and move them to AirBitz.  I have the seed backed up offline for my AirBitz wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:05:38
Difficulty has gone up dramatically since then so it's not really comparable.
@_date: 2016-07-14 08:32:43
My first through steam was instant but I do have 180 games so maybe I'm trustworthy?
@_date: 2016-07-04 21:53:57
Nice video.  
  
I'm on android and using AirBitz.  I'm liking it but how do I know what's best out of all the options?  (Copay, AirBitz, coinbase, circle, bresdwallet, mycelium) etc .
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:26:24
I fear that it's very easy for someone to get bitcoins onto an exchange wallet but not securely back them up in offline/secure wallets.  
  
This is going to be a problem if adoption does increase.
@_date: 2016-07-08 10:21:42
I predict a 33% drop in the price in the days after the havening.  Then it will slowly rise as normal.
@_date: 2016-07-10 09:04:23
Have you got the transaction ID?  
  
Some issues I've had with circle is.  When sending money to circle it needs 4 confirmations and when sending out they sometimes use a low fee.
@_date: 2016-07-11 20:46:19
What!  Really &gt;_&gt;.  Damn.
@_date: 2016-07-06 09:37:28
I'll buy it if you use an escrow type service or an eBay listing?  
  
Inbox me.
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:57:06
It's literally minutes after....
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:41:37
According to Coinwarz calculator you'll make $22k profit a year.
@_date: 2016-07-06 10:53:40
Why would they need to?
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:31:46
The day the Schrödinger bitcoins are accessible is the day bitcoins are zero.
@_date: 2016-07-02 12:43:37
Im actually using Google Sheets.  I forget i'm not using Excel!  
  
Edit, what are we calling pocket change?
@_date: 2016-07-04 07:01:47
The idea is 10x now. I won't need to cash out....
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:20:14
Seems a reasonable extrapolation.
@_date: 2016-07-04 14:35:58
The more lost the more you're are worth...
@_date: 2016-07-04 14:37:01
Nope. I never win anything anyway!
@_date: 2016-07-09 09:46:27
Not sure why I'd celebrate the value going down...
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:42:53
Thoughts on paper wallets?  I'm thinking of creating a paper wallet per each BTC I buy.
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:13:48
What are the miners actually solving?  What is the work done?
@_date: 2016-07-09 15:19:08
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:28:07
Why not just pay from the exchange to bitpay?
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:31:19
Thanks for the help mate!  I found a few different routes, based off your message!
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:09:44
If I'm using AirBitz with the seed backed up, 2FA and a strong password.  
  
Is it safe to say my BTC are fairly secure?
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:38:35
How long did it take to go from 100 mil to 10 bil?
@_date: 2016-07-06 10:26:57
I'd probably make a new wallet and transfer it over.  Start fresh.
@_date: 2016-07-09 21:17:52
So you want to buy bitcoins without transferring money...  
  
Look on local bitcoins, might find a cash buyer.
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:29:23
Currently in AirBitz mobile app.  
  
I have the seed backed up and encrypted with the encryption key stored in my firearms safe.  
  
Ideally I can access my BTC if I lose my phone or lose my home.  
  
EDIT:  Even if somebody found the random string in my safe they'd have little clue what it actually is, let alone where the file is stored.
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:08:48
That's like £25 above circles and coinbase price.
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:48:17
I had 1 when they were like £5.  Sold it.  
  
I have lots of savings for a new house but not got big enough balls to invest a serious amount in 1 go.  Doing £100 a month atm.
@_date: 2016-07-09 08:23:16
Not sure how that's worked out?  Bitcoin dropped and gained massive amounts over the last month.  The GBP predictably dropped 10%.
@_date: 2016-07-04 21:16:35
I literally posted this yesterday and it made the front page.
  
  
Jesus man. Calm down with them reposts.
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:53:37
I love the design of that!  Any idea on a timeframe and any proof it's secure?
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:40:14
Like a soaked up sponge.
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:23:51
Personally i've been encrypting the seed and uploading to google drive.
  
I then keep that encryption key stored in 2 places with no description.  It's not the most secure but if you found one or the other you'd have no clue what it's for.
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:48:09
As someone with a small amount of bitcoin who's been out of the game for a while. 
  
What's happened and what do I need to do?
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:01:06
Bitcoin could be the alt...
@_date: 2016-07-15 21:38:44
I buy £50 every pay day.  If there's a healthy drop I buy some extra.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:22:58
Yeah it's painful to see that shit.  People constantly trying to persuade other people to buy and sell.  It's so transparent.
@_date: 2016-07-10 19:43:25
Because the dollar will drop?
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:48:46
AirBitz and Bread wallet are my recommendations.  
  
Bread wallet is in beta on android.  
  
I wish AirBitz could import a paper wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:40:53
Make sense.  How does the 25BTC reward get split after each block?
@_date: 2016-07-15 20:21:11
I normally track USD/BTC and GBP/BTC.  Since the £ has dropped against the dollar the BTC price had changed almost perfectly with it.
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:08:32
I sent £30 with £1.50 fee.  1input, 1output.  
  
It was picked up next block.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:55:14
Isn't it for Eth mining and other crypto?  
  
I thought btc was well out of GPU range.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:14:33
I hope so! I cashed out at £2300
@_date: 2016-07-04 17:00:11
Could someone with a extremely low hashrate get it?
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:58:51
I only have 10 coins so didn't want to yet.
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:18:48
Just use giftoff.
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:06:46
Been wanting to switch to a paper wallet.
  
  
Guess this is my push now.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:56:50
Is the price meant to.drop?
@_date: 2016-07-05 22:17:44
I was under the impression that it there could be smaller denominations if needed.
@_date: 2016-07-11 22:29:10
Is the security of AirBitz acceptable?  The fact it stores the wallet online worries me.  I might wait for a full breadwallet release.
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:07:43
What's the next block like?
@_date: 2016-07-16 01:33:02
