This sounds very promising. Experience?

Thanks, but I already looked there. Most of these ATMs are marked as down except one, which I mentioned in the OP.

Have you travelled with them? There are quite a lot of reviews saying they're making a lot of mistakes, not necessarily ripping customers off but things like wrong dates, not notifying about cancelled trips, etc.

I'm in Europe. American Airlines doesn't offer enough flights here.
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:39:42
Any experience or just googled?

Any experience with them? Seems to be the same guy behind them as ABitSky. I suppose it could be a small entrepreneur, but I'm a bit scared of arriving at the airport gate with an invalid ticket.

It doesn't show Bitcoin as payment option for any flight. Any idea? I think I'll contact their support.

Alright, maybe you're right. Many of these are too far outside town that I'd try and find them as a tourist, especially because I don't want to waste my time just looking for money. I'll try Welcome News and Fuckoffee and report back. Thanks!

Sadly, Gyft is not available in Germany. [How would you explain these bad reviews here?](
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:48:32
Well, I still have two unconfirmed transactions from yesterday, one with and one without fee.
@_date: 2015-09-30 18:48:40
Ah, points. I don't know, but after all that'd be just a bonus, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2015-09-30 18:34:40
When I used them, they worked fine and I believe they even offered European cards as well.

This idea has been done a lot I think, but yeah, I wanted to do one too. I hope my design is at least kind of unique (I haven't looked at many cards) and I didn't accidentally recreate someone's idea. Sorry if I did.
I tried to stay simple and because I don't even know how you'd use the card to pay to it, from it, or whatever you want to do, I just made a simple design with what might be enough: the address, place for a QR Code and the name of who it belongs to.
Now if anyone might explain how you use the codes to pay and withdraw and pay to them or whatever, I might be able to improve this one. And also design suggestions, tried to stay simple with it though.
Edit: Forgot to explain what my though process looked like while creating this:
Top picture is the front, simple, doesn't have to show much, just has to be obvious what it is. A Bitcoin card, so the logo is on it.
Bottom picture is the back, obviously, the QR Code to scan and a code right next to it for maybe some kind of awesome device that is able to scan small addresses from the card. You hold it under some scanner and bam, got your address, for whatever. And then, a readable version too.
Another Edit: Here, the files for you to change and whatever you like to do with it: [PSD File]( (Unfortunately my Dropbox is full and I don't know any good sites for file upload. Suggestions for that too?)

I agree with you. I think I just forgot to change the font after searching for an appropriate one. Well, thanks.
[Does this look better?](
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:59:13
Wow, thank you!

Sell them on Bitmit or If they have appropriate prices they'll be bought fast. (Right now most of them are about  twice the price they're worth there.)

Awesome! I didn't finish ANY books yet, but that motivates me. I'll do what you said! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:14:32
I'd like to sell books in German. Will that be possible sometime in the future?
