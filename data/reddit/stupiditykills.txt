Hi, it's been 10 days and the only update I got was that the ticket was closed due to inactivity yet again. When can I get an answer to my case?

My email shows them explicitly saying their bank account changed without them knowing?

I've messaged your account, thanks for responding. As a new user though, at no point in the whole process would one be made aware of this change unless they followed your social media or blog, which most people don't have a need for. Even an email notification or something would have worked because otherwise how are users supposed to know without intentionally checking for this?

So under 1k?

I was speaking about charting generally, switch that scale to normal then and it tells a different story, you get my point. I'm not against TA, I use it myself too, but still you can have conformation bias when charting oneself, are you really going deny that generally speaking? And funny you say people are getting rich using it. What percent of people trading from home do you think are even broke-even, much less rich? Just take a stroll through the charts people publish on tradingview, at least every other forecast turns out completely wrong.

The top rated charters there still have pretty shit stats, definitely less than 50% of their calls which you might as well toss a coin then. Again, I'm not discrediting all TA or the ability for some to profit using it. I think that trend line is likely to hold as well, but what more can you say than that? That was my point originally because OP appeared to be a novice, just that you should take any TA with a huge shovel of salt.

How is 50% decent? That means I would have done just as well if I toss a coin and long/short based on head/tails, in the long run average. Aside from that, I agree with the rest of what you said, I get trading and TA too. But still the well documented fact in academia is that on average and in aggregate, people do not sustainably earn abnormal risk-adjusted returns. Individual stories about some people who made a killing in x years don't mean much.

Facts of those price points on those days yes, but evidence of what? It's confirmation that bias as in selective data point picking. Conveniently omits the all time high which in on a day that doesn't fit, ignores the high point on the start of the solid red line, the bottom line can be drawn slightly differently, change the scale to log and it's a completely different picture. Coincidences are everywhere, and you can make a chart tell any story you want with how you draw.
