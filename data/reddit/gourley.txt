Let me rephrase it, doesn't seem like some of y'all are getting it...
I'll use the low end even though the bulk of the transaction was at a much greater price...
$238 is the difference between 14,107 &amp; 13,869... Let's put all the fees in there, $36, you get $202... I still bought nearly $1,300 worth at a $202 less price than I started with and got LESS BTC.

You have 25 BTC to spare? 8-/
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:47:37
Same deliema for me, I'm at $1,200 off LTC just since last night. It's real money, but going for more. I see $500 LTC coming.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:59
Hell no

Same question I ask myself everyday. I've made around $2k trading but at the rate it's going up I would of made more if I had just held.
Currently on the sidelines waiting for my buy back in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:19:10
Waited on a dip 3 weeks, bought back in yesterday before the huge gain. No dip is coming. Makes the 9k dip a month ago look like a dumb move for not buying. LOL
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:30:37
What program/exchange do you use for a stop loss? How do you spend your BTC? Hardly anywhere accepts it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:24:27
Going all in aye?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:20
Someone better get 18k memes ready lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:11:02
accurate asf.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:34:26
Account history but it's the same immediate receipt that pops up.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:23:59
They gave you $1 worth of BTC when you signed up. Signed up in 2015 and I went back and looked the other day and that $1 is worth $33 now. Pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:03:16
LOL it was a dream. I've noticed the price is pretty sideways most of the day here in America and if you go to sleep you can miss 2k+ increases.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:24:49
If you sent it via the BITTREX exchange you need to find your email and confirm it, then it'll go through.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:54:10
For amounts that low I would just setup a coinbase account. Real easy and simple for everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:20:57
It can be fixed to extend more than 8 decimal places.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:14:17
Little late there.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:09:35
You can buy in Bovada.LV gaming website and transfer it into BTC, takes 24 hours. It doesn't lock the price however.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:21:19
I made $1k in my sleep.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:48
Moon was $10k. We're about to pass Mars.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:39:33
Sent you a PM.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:30:50
I understand the math. I'm just wondering why I bought $1,300 more BTC at a $200 less price (being conservative) and ended up with less.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:10:52
Bought .28 worth, made $1k since yesterday. Hop on the train!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:54
When to sell
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:42:03
The big boys are only going to accept BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:21:52
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:44:26
It's ok you bought at $20,000 buddy...We're here for you. Maybe one day you'll break even.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:05:35
Tip him .000001 , be worth about $100 in a few years.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:21:29
Do you even crypto bro? LTC or ETH only similar that has real potential, IMO.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:02:51
Worth $19 today, just for signing up!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:27:43
I hate how my post gets down voted for a legit question and discussion. LOL.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:52:51
Usually 1 day and very reliable.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:30:25
Been waiting 3 weeks for a dip to re-buy back in. Couldn't sit on the sidelines any longer, bought back in last night...already up $400 profit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:36:39
Since BTC is traded 24/7, what happens when we go to sleep and wake up and it's $1k again? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:28:21
It's skyrocketing out of control IMO.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:37:35
Recent bitcoin investor, had $2k invested in the 3 major ones. Just sold this morning while I'm still ahead. Will get back in when I see an upward trend.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:48:24
Definitely see both sides. However, why wouldn't you sell now (or yesterday as I did) and buy back now (or later it appears) at a better price? The fees should be the last thing you're worried about when it comes to hundreds or thousands of dollars. You will recoup those fees if you buy back at the right price and it rises eventually.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:01:26
$4300 &amp; Litcoin at $70 club :(
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:08:24
and because they also accept regular tips I assume. Also, it kinda lays the joke out...it's a tip jar.
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:52:23
Up $.10+ since I posted.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:10:10
How much BTC do you own to be that secure with it? Asking for a friend.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:05:44
Not sure why I get down voted asking a legit question. Wow.
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:08:45
Can you buy on there then transfer them to your Coinbase or Bittrex? Sounds like you can, just wanting to confirm.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:33:12
he set himself up for zero pussy.
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:33:22
Honest question looking for an honest answer; how do you feel not selling above $15k per BTC ? The people saying "BTC will be worth a million each some day"... do you have any idea how much money it would take for it to reach those prices?
