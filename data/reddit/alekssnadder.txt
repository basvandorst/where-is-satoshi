How is this market manipulation? Low volume = market manipulation? Enlighten me.

Is it though? To me it's just a sign that interest is low. I also notice that there has been a huge decline in articles about crypto in the big papers here in Norway, for example. Crypto is just boring atm, but I'm still pretty sure that we are in an early phase. Think it'll be a boring summer and we'll hopefully see a similar rise as last year.
Sorry for my English.

Yep. It's gotten a bit annoying, cause you can always tell that people like this don't know how anything works. Price manipulation probably happens, but this guy doesn't know how, when, where, who or why.

Yes, buy. Spread the word.

Well, at some point it needs to go up or down with this low volume. It just feels like regular people are careful with their money atm and that it's bots buying/selling. Then someone with a lot of money dumps or pumps the price. The pumps/dumps are so sudden that it can't be organic imo. But then again, I don't know shit.

Here we go again...

What was absorbed? To me it looks like we're going lower. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:39:02
I don't get it.

No, that is not true. That was Alex Jones.
He clearly doesn't know shit about bitcoin, but that's not the point here either. Think 100 mill+ downloads/listens/views a month for his show..

You're probably right, but I hope not. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:54:49
And btc takes a shit again
