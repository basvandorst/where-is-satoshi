Said the delusional Bitcoin holders

This is so ridiculously off, I sincerely hope you're joking.
Sadly a lot of noobs I've seen/met recently in this space have similar lines of thinking.
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:08:09
You’re absolutely nuts. $33k by the end of the month? No.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:17:35
that's what you get for buying at all time highs.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:26:03
Yes I take all of my crypto advice from chefs

If you're only investing in Bitcoin, then you're not investing in revolutionary tech anymore. In fact, you're investing in outdated, expensive, and environmentally harmful tech. 
Bitcoin WAS revolutionary - there are now new coins/projects that are actually revolutionary tech.
Bring on the downvotes.

I do agree. We are definitely in the middle of a crazy mania phase/pseudo bubble, but it still doesn't change my overall above statement. Because I still think we haven't seen even half of the total money that will be poured into crypto over the next 2-3 years.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:16:57
Yeahhhh that’s a big no for me dogg. Maybe if you stopped at the 3rd pic.

Good lord you Bitcoin enthusiasts/newbies are slightly depresssing to watch. I sincerely wish you the best of luck.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:21:29
Haha, how could you POSSIBLY bother to actually use, trade, or send Bitcoin somewhere? What were you thinking trying to use a currency for anything rather than just letting it fester somewhere? What a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:35:59
We've hit peak fuckery.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:32:18
so you're saying you only made money because you switched it OUT of Bitcoin. Got it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:20:31
overnight tonight and tomorrow. 
Or maybe never.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:28:11
anywhere from 2k-13k. No one knows.

No way! That's crazy man. Thanks for sharing this story. /s

Bitcoin's market dominance is consistently dropping as more people see how unscalable and devoid of actual utility it is.... When other coins are much much faster and much much cheaper, it's only a matter of time as the market share dominance just keeps plummeting. The only ones in complete denial of those are those holding large amounts of BTC.
I'd be willing to bet a ton that Bitcoin isn't the top coin by the end of 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:52:07
Hey man we all have our goals. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:17:02
you're just making it worse bro
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:44:38
I feel bad for anyone who bought at 17+
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:34:14
not necessarily.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:03:27
So it will take them hours to get paid, along with a huge fee on top it. Sounds about right for Vegas.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:59:25
The mass public had some serious FOMO on Bitcoin, and are now trying to dump into smaller/cheaper alts, hoping for a similar explosion and payday.

@_date: 2019-01-01 08:04:51
It never will be 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:13:19
I'll go one further and say that it never gets back to $20k ever again.
@_date: 2019-01-02 03:17:58
Lol keep parroting that, been hearing that shit for almost two years
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:06:08
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:58:27
no you didn't.
