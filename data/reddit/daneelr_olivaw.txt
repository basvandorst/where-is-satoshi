Considering the market cap, national debt at current BTC prices is almost 200 times higher than the amount of BTC mined.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:16:55
Or the difference between the market cap and the total showing on the NYC Debt Clock.

What the fuck is going on, is it about to crash hard? Is that the futures pumping the price?
Ah, the futures have been delayed...
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:10:19
If you have spare time in the evenings, you can basically trade through Limit Sell / Limit Buy, but you always risk losing profit if the value just keeps rising like the past week. We are also due a correction, so definitely don't just buy and wait, check in every few hours and if you see a downward movement, it's probably a good idea to consider selling since you could be at a loss otherwise (you bought at &gt;$12k price).
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:23:03
I'm at work, can't focus on anything. What a mental week! Bubbly!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:41
I've said it before:
**B**ullish Year.
**T**errific Month.
**C**razy Week.
Hopefully not **B**ut **T**hen **C**rash...
I wouldn't be surprised if we saw $17k on GDAX today as it's already trading this high elsewhere.
EDIT. I get it, **B**lench **T**acky **C**ringe
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:16:41
EUR 14.7k.... That's unprecedented. It's definitely going to rise to 16k today on GDAX easily, probably even 16.8k....
And this is all before futures trading, but I fear it's the financial sector inflating before a significant shorting that'll drive the price. I really don't want to sound negative, I know that BTC will reach maturity at 30x current price in the future, but it just really seems like it's a bubble...
15.6k Wtf, time to make another thread in 15 minutes... 17k in 10h... At this rate we'll see 20k on 15th and 25k by the end of the year. Jesus.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:32:22
Isn't Bitcoin becoming more and more centralized due to the sheer power and energy requirement to keep it going?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:32
Yeah, price in EUR (where I'm trading) was holding at ~14.5k so it was definitely artificially inflated, it's probably going to settle at $16k by the end of the day, which is the price at Bitstamp.net.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:51:45
Oops, sorry, I know nothing, I've said nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:18
70% in one week.
This is either going to be an amazing or a painful month...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:50:49
You can always cash out a portion (on GDAX) and buy ETH/LTC with it, or just wait for  the dip / daily trade.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:57:02
Are you calling me a cunt, mate?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:21:18
10th/18th are going to be cruicial.
If I held more than I do, I'd still sell at least 1% every milestone (every 1000 BTC reaches). Just to avoid the feeling of regret if it crashes to under $10k. Ultimately if it doesn't drop, I'd still be in the green and I'd have surplus of cash to spend on other cryptos, on charity or just on ~~myself~~ my wife obviously :P
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:35:34
Also, buy as Limit Buy. No fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:14:15
Guys who're hodling - not a terrible idea to sell 2.5 - 5% of BTCs.
The rest is still skyrocketing, and if there's a correction, you'll have some spare cash for nice presents (or to buy the dip).
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:30
It's 502 for me...
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:49:18
If they pull it, they will cause a crash first, banking our money. And then there will be ban... I mean these people killed Qaddafi over gold backed currency, this is far worse...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:24
Scratch that, $19.4k
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:16:14
Ok, thanks for sharing, your opinion is as valuable as BCASH to me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:34:28
As tiny as my dick I'm afraid :/
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:51
Once it reaches $0.5m you're going to look at this comment and laugh...
RemindMe! 2 years
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:10
It fucking just hit $19k...
What the fuck!
This is going to hurt.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:25:52
Either way, it's 10:25am GMT/UTC here... I suppose 16k by lunch... Fucking mental!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:39
GDAX crashed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:49:17


That's what I meant by shorting and inflating first.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:18:55
Definitely. It was trading at EUR 14.9k , that's USD 17.5k . The price's now dropped to EUR 14.3k, but that's still almost 17k.
~~Wild week. Crazy month. Mental year.~~
**B**ullish year. **T**errific month. **C**razy week.
That's BTC for you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:05:10
Same here, my investment is tiny though. I never had too much in savings, barely moved to UK 2 years ago from Poland, so you can imagine. I will definitely invest more once the correction happens at some point. Unless we suddenly develop an actual quantum computer (upwards of 10k qubits), I don't anticipate BTC's encryption algorithm to be broken (and this rendering the whole currency useless)...
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:30:12
I've done it too many times in WoW with Enchanting supplies.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:09:44
What the flying fuck! It's 15k on GDAX... And 14.7k Euro, so there's definitely something fucky going on...
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:21:37
Out of curiosity, are you investing in other cryptos at the moment? Which of the more obscure ones are you particularly interested in?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:40:02
With the state of how things are:
Big Trouble Coming.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:31
It went from $16k to $16.9k within 40 minutes on GDAX.
31% daily change.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:33:19
Futures trading.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:41:07
You jest but if they banned it in China, they might as well do it in the US soon enough.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:09
I suppose we'll either see $4k or $40k once Futures kick in.... Crazy fucking market.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:08
Lmao, time to prepare for a $18000 thread...
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:32:33
I meant that the website literally crashed for 15 minutes when BTC was trading there for $19,900
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:25
Well, most likely, the question is if it crashes at $20k or $200k...
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:31:01
Your honour. I have 194,387g in Stardew Valley!
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:28:47
Have two wallets.
One with 0.01 BTC that you know the words to.
One with... what? No... I only have one wallet, honestly..
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:43:40
Thing is, we actually do want to have fiat cash around. Do you really want your every single transaction fully traceable?
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:31:47
You mentioned that you can't pay out from the wallet though? So if I earn with GDAX I have to transfer to a different site?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:15:16
Yeah, I was thinking of using CoinBase and then GDAX for training (which I've been monitoring for the past few weeks after I failed to buy at 1900). So you're saying my regular visa debit card will not be enough to buy there in GBP or am I being daft and missing something?
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:58:19
Which platform would you recommend to buy with (esp for UK)?
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:03:57
London's Metro is 3 times the size of Rome (15'000km^^2 ), Berlin's Metropolitan area is 30'000km^^2, so it's 6 times that of Rome (5,300 km ^^2 ).
@_date: 2018-06-03 12:28:37
[Rome's metropolitan area is 4,357,041.](
[Berlin's metropolitan area is 6,004,857.](
[London's metropolitan area is 14,040,163.](
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:19:00
Almost $11k today, I wonder when the correction comes, it seems the price is only inflating...
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:24:29
If you're driving at 1000mph and you're wobbling, you're bound to crash.
BTC's extremely volatile with daily price variations reaching 15% at times (the wobbling). Current price, while historic, is definitely artificially inflated and there will be a correction (we've seen it happen in the past). Obviously the question is how severe it will be, the demand is ever rising.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:51:31
Well, it's definitely going to dip so I say sell some at 10k and buy at the dip + get yourself a nice meal because this is a tremendous milestone, you f\*\*\*ing cheap b\*\*\*\*rd.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:03:57
you were joking you fucking bastard, that video is so fucking gory, omg, that's definitely enough reddit for today...
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:33:41
I don't condone cannibalism, but perhaps we should at least expect him to stream himself eating bull's testicles.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:34:37
Or just sell some now, wait for it to dip and buy at a lower price?
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:49:23
Paging @_date: 2017-11-26 18:59:12
He just won't do it. I don't want him to, frankly, but as I said in a different thread, I would definitely like him to eat bull's testicles.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:19:12
$9,475... is fucked :D
EDIT. Down to $9269.99. Last 45 minutes, what a crazy roller coaster, perhaps is safe for now...
EDIT. Back to $9400. Crazy day.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:15:05
It's possible, $10k is psychological, then it'll probably settle at $8k for a week or two only to start creeping up to $10k again.
Eitber way, it's a truly bumpy ride:
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:21:26
Yeah, I mean we're definitely due for a global crisis anyway, all indexes are far above their levels of '08...
@_date: 2019-12-25 22:15:57
I see many coins that EUR replaced :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:14:11
Just eat a bull's testicle, man.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:20:30
If there's a pullback, it's going to be short lived - many people want in now and are waiting for a dip.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:08:52
Fucking hell, not sure if you're joking or not...
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:41:22
Just the way Mike Tyson pronounces the plural of hat.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:38:04
Yep, managed to sell at EUR 7500 and bought back at EUR 5700. It's not a huge gain, but it's not terrible.
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:44:27
And call them BitCats.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:58:43
BTC is back to ~$4000, I wouldn't be surprised if it went to $5000+ within the next two weeks.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:35:55
Whatever it followed, it ended up losing almost 80% value and the trend continues.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:46:40
Yeah, it seems it should be possible to increase your BTC investment by 0.5%-1% daily (given all the volatility). Depending on how much you actually invested, it could rival the day job as you stated yourself.

@_date: 2017-10-12 11:34:03
How do you sell your BTC once you bought it through Coinbase?
I read many stories that coinbase freezes/closes accounts and people lose access to them...

War. War never changes.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:50:31
Yep. Imagine starting a new crypto coin and Satoshi telling you it's going to end up like BCash.
