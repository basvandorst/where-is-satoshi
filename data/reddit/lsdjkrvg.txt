No problem I just need a raspberry pi, feature phone and a 200k usd electronic billboard.

Forgive my callus hostiliy but twats like you are a dime a dozen. Aside from wise-ass meta discussions you havn't contributed much of substance so I see no reason not to lump you with the bcash crowd.
And if Trump has 1,000,000 ideas I'm not going to listen to all of them to find the one idea that isn't shit and I'm most definetely not going to listen to the same 5 ideas over and over while pretending it's a discussion to let him repeat them.
But you're not trump and I'm actually reading what you write. This is your chance to contriube something. Is there something you can contribute that isn't a rehash of the same 5 things that other asshats have repeated since 2015?

Funny how you always choose to respond to the irrelevant parts of my post. Here I'll bring you back on track:


Hallmark of a disingenuous concern troll.

Because when we open the doors for Ver and his sock puppets all I have to do is ignore one or two posts. Right? Are you new here? Because from what your writing it seems you're the ignoramus. If you want to read 120 Egon_1 threads per day you can visit him on rbtc.

I probably have more negative karma on rbtc across all my accounts than anyone else but lets be real:






Somehow I doubt that lol

You get called a troll when the questions you ask return 500 pages of results when typed into the reddit search bar. Now stfu and go back to rbtc you concern troll.

Is your idea of a "discussion", repeating the same thing over and over until you get your way or what? Name a single argument that hasn't been brought forward by the bcash crowd a fucking million times in the last 4 years. We are sick of hearing the same shit over and over. Bitcoin has moved on bcashers should too.

PM me your address. I'll come over, bring a megaphone and scream how the moon landing is a hoax, the earth is flat and how your brain has become liquified by chemtrails because you refuse to wear the same tin foil hat as I do. Once the police proceed to forcefully remove me I'll be kicking and screaming how you are a pathetic weakling that doesn't tollerate different opinions. I'll continue screeching how if you cut out a mans tongue you just fear what he has to say and how being censored is proof that Im  right.

Removing: Autistic screechers that rage on about how SW is insecure because it's an anyone can spend output while ignoring that the same can be said for p2sh. Retards whining about how SW breaks the chain of signatures and how this is not just wrong to do so but also illegal. Imbecils crying about RBF breaking Bitcoin. Conspirtards going on about how Axa/Bilderberg/Rothschild funded Blockstream captured Bitcoin development.
YEARS after the debate has been settled. For the sole reason of continuing to bitch and moan. I call that moderating the loonies. You are free to call it what ever else you want.

Os-nonbinary here tending towards pan-gnu/demi-unix but windows users should be abolished as they are enablers of the systemic oppression exerted by the Microsoftiarchy.

I could tell you but you wouldn't understand because you have been influenced by the axa blockstream satelite radio waves. Put on a tinfoil hat and come over to r/btc if you want to learn the "truth". lol

When purchasing miners your time frame for ROI is precisely never. Miners are obsolete the day they are announced your only hope for ROI has always been an appreciating Bitcoin.
Any form of collusion on what is hailed the safest blockchain in existence will destroy its entire value proposition. They way I see it. If miners colluded to reorg the blockchain even a single block. Bitcoin wouldn't lose 20, 50 or 70 % of it's value. It would instantly lose 100% 8k USD -&gt; 0USD.  Might as well use Ripple or Fiat at that point.

Is now a meme for retards that try hard to be purposefully obtuse.
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:31:39


Miners colluding to reorg the chain is precisely not "exactly the same" as blocks being orphaned. BCH obviously had miners collude. Comparing that to a random reorg without intent to alter consensus rules is disingenuous.
