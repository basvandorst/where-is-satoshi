Up 1000% on my investment made in may. I won't say how much I invested but it wasn't chump change and it wasn't a ton. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:05:15
Were you saying that last tiny drop as well?

Free market is Darwinism in society. The smart get rich. The illiterate don't get shit because of their terrible decisions. Such is life.

The us dollar inflationary rate is 2.2% and look how that's doing for us. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:07:27
I wouldn't doubt that this is the work of shareblue. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:52:51
Indeed. 1090% profit since then.

Buy gift cards from gyft and live off that. No taxes. And very simple. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:51:06
I'd buy so much.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:56:09
Early 2013 was 10$? I remember that being the 400$ or so era.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:04:39
There's an app for that. It's called gyft. 25 cent fees

God. I can't wait to get a call about it from my middle aged mother...
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:36:45
Lol. Makes perfect sense given what CNN is. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:18:46
I tried buying something and bitcoin isn't an option.
Correction: I just tried now and I see bitcoin as an option. Weird.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:35:40
Bch is pulling back, btc is going up. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:45:47
Hopefully he does, but I doubt it.
Even still, he's not our ally quite yet. He's simply a bystander who refuses to intervene.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:31:26
It's the wild west. There are no morals. Everything is permitted. If they wanted a "get rich quick" scheme, the knew what they signed up for.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:32:42
Buy now. Price is rebounding now.
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:58:53
What txn fees? 2$?
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:44:29
Eth is not deflationary.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:37:57
Completely agree. It can get hectic. But all in all, it's the wild west. 
I'm not sitting on a portfolio worth diversifying imo. I mean, to most, it is. But to me, I'm not quite there yet. I probably should, but I don't really send btc back and forth as it's always sitting on the exchange, or sitting in CLAM safe and sound.(the man had control of nearly 50k btc that belonged to the sites users and didn't run off when he could have easily).
Plus, I feel the need to amass as much btc as quickly as possible because it will only get more difficult as the price rises. So it's a race against the clock for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:04:11
Okay. Now I remember it more clearly. I thought it was 2012 because I remember it being a new year when I sold. I guess a lot happened to me in the first half of 2014... 
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:14:03
I see you also read Wikileaks. ;)
He's the DNC's cock holster.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:40:42
Perhaps. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:50:06
How have people not noticed you're trolling?
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:29:20
Meh... I'd say that if costs are doubled, I'd say wages have increased 50%. Either way, it's far more difficult to achieve financial success now than it was 10 years ago.
Well to be fair, not necessarily 10 years ago as we were in a recession, but like, late 90's- early 2000's.

You could always buy a pizza store GC and then have it on the ready for when you do want to buy pizza
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:24:56
But he believes gold is true money... 
What's the difference between gold and bitcoin? He doesn't believe in bitcoin. 
Sorry. Gave the wrong link at first.
If you're not with bitcoin, you're kind of against it as a politician I suppose. He just wants the government to stay out of it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:21:31
I don't like this sentiment. Why shut out the little people?
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:51:54
I mean every trade back and forth from an exchange is gunna cost you a lot of money in the long run
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:55:48
This is what I don't understand.
People thought mining for .2 wasn't worth it  for a week 4/5 years ago. Now, if they did that for a year, they now have a shit ton more money than what they spent on electricity.
So long as price keeps increasing, mining will still be profitable no matter how little hash power one has.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:57:42
That is stupid. I've sent the majority of my btc in the olden days directly from there to just dice. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:37:33
This will be me diverting conversation away from my future endeavours. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:00:06
That's not what the_donald users say. It's more of a leftist ideology to call for the death of people they don't like. 
Ie: countless democrat assassination attempts on republican senators and citizens, virtue signalling celebrities calling for trump's death. Antifa. Etc..
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:37:36
How funny. All those nations are experiencing a severe migrant crises and sexual assault is through the roof. Probably because they don't let women offer their opinions in public polls in Muslim nations. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:49:30
Except it's not an asset til he liquifies it I think. So the second he sells its both of theirs maybe?
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:15:48
Calling 7200 to 6900 a correction... Recently it went from 7k to 6.3k and bounced back. Were you saying that that was a correction as well? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:21:34
Think of it this way, 1 btc is one btc. You can't get more with it. Now you means to grow past it. You'll eventually amass 1 btc again and continue to make profits. It'll be worth in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:31:31
Couldn't anyone on this forum literally just steal the bitcoins on that address right now?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:22:37
I'm pretty sure national statistics don't lie. Sweden is 6 months away from being swedenstan and their sexual assault rate has gone through the roof. 
Let's bring up the UKs rampant migrant crime rate as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:05:23
I think I met the guy who ran that on just dice once or twice.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:06:22
Yeah I think it's stupid that coinbase is telling you that you cant gamble using YOUR bitcoin. What does it matter to them what you use your decentralised currency for?!?! It's like they don't understand the meaning of bitcoin! I currently use an exchange as my wallet, not very safe(I know), but it saves me on constant fees bringing it back and forth whenever I want to make a trade, and they were good with the BCH split.
Did coinbase hijack your coins you had on there or did they let you get them out?
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:06:30
Can't remember the more recent one. He had it on his Facebook.
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:47:18
Ya fooled me. I thought you were an undercover /btc shill.
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:01:50
Seems like he's running a downvote bot on this post. Everyone needs to upvote this.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:25:19
Nah. What's sad is that no pizza place directly accepts btc or bch. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:07:58
Welp. I was responding to this individual who said this is what the_donald users say. 
I mean, i haven't seen a majority enforce and impose their beliefs on a counter culture while utilizing violence to do so. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:03:09
Except ron Paul came out against bitcoin not too long ago.   -___-
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:43:12
Shouldn't you have gotten your money back already to your wallet? It's been 3 days.   
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:33:04
Forgive my skepticism, but is that a common occurrence?!? Who are they to say what you do with your bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:14:26
What's your address?!?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:44:27
Easy, give the guy the BTC, then $1. Write that as the sales price. = Profit
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:51:05
I'm talking like 2 weeks ago recent. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:41:54
If you call being under the thumb of a tyrannical deep state great living standards, that's you man. 
The fact of the matter is that the fed reserve extorts the American people. Things 10 years ago cost nearly twice as much as they used to. Education prices for example, have gone through the roof. It's not living in a hut, but financially, we're all screwed with the dollar.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:28:16
Ah okay. Gotcha. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:31:06
Yes. But he doesn't support it. He supports gold. Not bitcoin. We need politicians who push for it to overthrow the federal reserve. 
But we've seen how that's gone with every person in a position of political power in the last two centuries.
He's even recently come out in support of cash as he claims it's untraceable and the government wants to eliminate it. But the correct response is to move to a decentralized currency entirely. Not play by the feds rules at all.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:21:29
Sorry. Check the last 7 days... 7.6k to 7.2k and back again. You can't call 200$ a correction when we have bigger swings than that everyday.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:47:50
I mean, I can say with honesty I feel more safe when I exchange my btc for some other coin and hold that coin on a certain website of a very highly trusted crypto individual rather than keeping it on the exchange. 
The risk exists, but it exists everywhere. Who knows if the waiting time of 3-5 confirmations will end up costing you nearly 150% profit on a trade? Bitcoin doesn't do you any good sitting in your wallet. Like people say, one bitcoin is worth one bitcoin. 
Had I not used the exchange as my wallet, I'd have X now. Since I traded correctly over time, I'm worth 3x because of good timing on the exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:43:11
Not banned yet ;)
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:05:17
Oh okay. Thanks for explaining it to me. :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:31:56
You can buy gc with cash/BTC. Whoops. I misread.
You can't sell the GC for fiat or BTC there.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:27:18
Yeah, see, I like having my money there on call, and not being hit with a 6$ fee each time. Need to be there on a moment's notice to take advantage of the dips. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:40:39
I can't believe they're that deluded... 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:13:44
Would you say that one who does not prey on the weak, but enjoys natural selection putting people into their rightful place is a psychopathic tendency?
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:31:28
Same as me!!!
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:42:33
What? It makes perfect sense. Make it seem like everyone is in overwhelming support of bch rather than btc by using bots, pump the price, watch the fools buy in, then crash it and cash out. 
It's Alinsky tactics 101 really. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:56:50
I bought at .47 regretting not buying at .11 and cashing in on the 4x btc... Sold at .51 minutes before the crash, got lucky
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:07:05
Shareblue? The company notorious for botting Reddit stories to the front page and downvoting things that go against their agenda? Very real. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:54:05
Then why did they stop accepting btc on their website?!?!
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:24:25
It has a 50% chance of success on the gambling site they take your bitcoin to. Yeah. They'll double it. But that doesn't mean you'll get it back
