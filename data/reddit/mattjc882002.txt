To have an account get a loan you need to prove I.d, address, mobile number, proof of earnings by pictures so cannot see that happening buddy.
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:53:32
Sorry I meant im surprised it isnt higher
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:00:41
It was up earlier nada came down around 4-5 hours ago. Been within .05 cent

Used myself several times and recommend
@_date: 2014-10-10 08:01:29
My fears exactly. As my plan is to keep my coins for a long time I thought this would be a great idea to earn something with them. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:31:26
I see. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:54:21
surprised to not see it on here already. Surely a huge game changer as it will help those not keen on paper wallets
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:05:28
Just think people are holding coins and now want some profit so sell. If theres more sell pressure than buy price goes down my friend.
@_date: 2014-12-23 01:53:00
Its cool to see a post like this make it on here. Being from the UK it brings home how btc is everywhere not just US! Make sure to post this in r/bitcoinuk if not already
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:36:42
Always gd to hear gd news about btc in UK. However I set up an account with payasugym for the gym I work in and no gym openly advertises they are on there listings. Gyms want people to join/pay directly to the gym, this website is just lead generation

I get your point but you really telling me something that could shift the price isnt relevant to being on here ....

What exchange you use buddy as I am guessing you from UK as well
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:23:37
The idea is say a coin I have I sell it for current price on bitstamp plus $50. Then when completed I buy from an exchange a new coin for the current rate ending $50 up. 
Redo the process until no longer want to
@_date: 2014-09-21 16:15:40
I have used them as well. If you do bank transfer in believe bitty is cheaper commission wise .... I think 
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:16:24
I'm from UK as well. Highly recommend you use Bittylicious if you do invest. Can pay in gbp and it's a uk based exchange
@_date: 2014-12-18 00:29:08
Step 1 - Move into area free in space around you step 2 - Proceed to pull your head out of your arse step 3 - stop posting here if you clearly think such bad of btc I.e. stop trolling
@_date: 2014-11-13 08:49:19
A month ago or so there was a post to do with thwir lawyer saying its absolutely miles off. The bit licence will be the next big news but the EFT is a while off
@_date: 2014-10-10 08:03:45
How have they done this? Are they doing it to paper wallets or just any other wallet I.e. Ona. Phone/pc
@_date: 2014-11-01 22:05:12
Just mad when you see some the comments people put. It's almost as if a homeless person on the road has said
"Hey! You heard about btc? Should buy right now with all your savings as it will be 10,000 per btc by tomorrow"
Granted everyone latches onto the fact btc drops on gd news but the gd news has been great news. People like paypal, dell not small time people at all ... 
@_date: 2014-11-29 09:44:39
I did wonder but then I also wondered if this could be someone who wanted to buy after black Friday

I do agree and I wonder how many ppl holding btc are doing it as an investment. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:34:18
Only ever used bittylious or bitbargain doing bank transfers. Never ever had a problem. Both are heavy on the usual id documents as use them to restrict how much you can buy. Both very gd tho
@_date: 2014-09-12 10:28:58
Will do. Sent a small fee to one waiting for it to be confirmed. When done I will sweep and destroy that wallet. Planning on splitting my balance over several wallets. That blog really does make understanding everything so much easier as I've read so many and got lost somewhere down the line.
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:36:53
Annoys me the comment about Laundering and crime ... its a stigma just following btc around
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:53:10
100% hold buddy dont sell until silver goes $21+
@_date: 2014-09-11 18:23:58
Well I know I want to be buying anymore coins before you do lol. Surely that will jump the price a little?
@_date: 2014-11-14 12:47:18
Depends what price you buy the silver at? At it's highest lately silver has been $21-22
@_date: 2014-11-02 08:13:49
Gives indication of the market confidence. Hence what happened the other week with the wall at it being taken down.
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:27:27
Very good article. Surprised it didnt include the fact that russia is constantly increasing its gold storage especially by accepting gold for oil
@_date: 2014-10-24 08:32:48
Giving to the fact that I was reporting on facts as that's what is on the order book at the time and not adding any guess work to it, you sir ... are the ass
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:46:43
Another 0.5 purchased until payday. Expecting the same price point come Friday hopefully to make a full coin!
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:36:44
Agreed however there is many people new to btc who prob don't even know about order books and the other subchats. It was from this forum I learnt about them myself
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:18:35
If you are referring to the other latest posts this is different to the sell wall as it's at different price points 
@_date: 2014-11-02 08:12:54
It actually can if you have a 3rd party look after the bet funds, so if you are trying to say it's a negative of bitcoin that you can't do it then your wrong buddy as there's examples of it on reddit 
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:03:18
Think of it this way using everyone whos involved in btc.
Everyone = 100%
For a price rise you need:
51%+ buying
49% and less selling
For no change
50% buying
50% selling
For price decrease
49% or less buying
51%+ selling 
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:18:48
Is this bit lending club you are on about?
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:08:37
This is my biggest concern as every fu*ker in the world whos holding (inc me) is going to dump coins on exchanges. This I feel/wonder what long term damage this could do to btc
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:05:19
Disagree a bit there buddy. I think btc is so early so new that perception isnt a part of it. Its the constant change from bull market or bear market that has got the price to its place today. If we all decided to sell and no one buy btc would drop until the point everyone stopped selling. Exactly the same for a price rise.
@_date: 2014-11-29 09:11:53
I see what you are saving and I expected someone to say that btc would be on its way to becoming a full blown currency for a country. My issue would be is at those prices you are relying on everyone else not selling in mass ... 
@_date: 2014-11-27 10:37:51
Well done
@_date: 2014-11-14 12:43:52
I use bittylious and bit bargain who act as a third party. With both you transfer funds to the websites whilst they take coins from potential sellers. Once both parties have done both parts you get your coins and the funds go to the sellers bank account.
There is a slight markup on the cost of btc though using these sites.
@_date: 2014-09-12 09:57:47
Much appreciated sending that link. Created 3 wallets and encrypted them all as well. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:49:10
To me this looks like they have set up an investment arm to pump money into btc companies in turn hoping to make their coins worth more. Anyone agree?
@_date: 2014-10-15 05:52:39
Go for it!
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:43:48
What exchange you use as I guess you are from UK as well
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:28:41
Cheers buddy!
@_date: 2014-09-09 04:32:31
Thank you. Wanted a full coin but due to exchange restrictions couldn't manage it in one go
@_date: 2014-11-01 22:17:39
Agree. However people will see that as being the btc community being 'we are right everyone is wrong we can only say things that please them'

Make a passage .... TO THE MOONNNNNNNNNN 
@_date: 2014-09-18 10:44:29
I have decided my goal is to get to 10 btc. Along the road I will update here when I make a new purchase getting closer to my goal. If not interesting to anyone else it can be a diary for me! 
I am now sitting at 3 btc all in cold storage with bip38 protection across several wallets.
I look forward to what the future holds!
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:40:05
Sorry question from a newbie. If miners stopped what impact you think this will have on price? 
@_date: 2014-09-12 23:02:28
Just now tried to sweep my paper wallet for the first time and I'm getting the message cannot recognise input. I expected when I scanned the private key it would ask me for the password. Is that not how it works?
@_date: 2014-11-29 09:10:23
If you actually hold btc then what do you forsee the price reaching one day? For me if google, apple, ebay/paypal took on btc fully I see no reason why it could get upto 5k. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:03:47
Very gd point! 
Many talk about the security of a btc wallet vs a credit/debit card but having someone's security number on the back of their bank card is seen as perfectly normal?
Therefore why/how can anyone have a objection to paper wallet/card btc wallets 
@_date: 2014-10-15 08:41:05
For EU I believe you can use any of the big names (circle etc). There is another site I personally use which is bittylious. They act as a third party so take the coins from the seller and take the money from you and they perform the transaction. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:59:50
No im not stupid. ... the news didn't create those changes it was the simple fact of more people selling vs buying quote simple. The news may be what kick starts peoples decision but ultimately its the buying to selling ratio
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:12:01
Cheers buddy
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:00:37
I never implied that it happened more yesterday especially. What I'm saying is using any chart displaying daily transactions shouldn't be used as a key metric as it's not saying how many coins for instance have been bought in a day but anytime any coin has moved from an A to a B.
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:35:37
Right now Russia and China are trying to get $ off of Oil. That's just the starting point potentially. £ was once the used currency

.... and the full coin has arrived, now the proud owner of 1.09 btc
@_date: 2014-11-21 12:38:26
Personally I would say no Gold is. Russia is accepting it as the only payment for oil and gas, china uses gild to buy from Russia. All a long taking gold from the West. Soon the gold paper market will fall and cause gold to skyrocket. Putin is a clever man and is going a cold war by markets.
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:36:25
Could it mean futures markets go and end with people not shorting btc anymore?
@_date: 2014-11-28 09:36:03
Controversial but use loan sites like bitjam or blc. You can buy btc then lend out at your choosen interest rate or if you jump through the hoops can register to get loans and reinvest them so you keep the interest. Im not praising it as you need to be on the ball and have luck but so far im close to being 20% up on my initak btc holdings after 2 months. You can however get people not pay you back to which you have to debt chase
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:24:54
If want to buy online go for bittylious or bit bargain if you are happy to do in person then zip zap is the way to go as it's the cheapest in most occasions. I've used both the online companies tho and both been great.
@_date: 2014-09-22 07:05:42
Some other gd UK exchanges is Bittylious and bit bargain as can buy in gbp so you don't get stung with the 'not gbp fee' from the bank
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:22:43
BOOM .... with the price drop just purchased my next coin now sitting at 5 half way to my goal of 10

Dont think you have to for btc due ti what its considered as

Hopefully others will pick up on it and look to issue elsewhere 
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:06:51
Am I the only one thinking it would be good if it didnt go well? If it had price would drop then comes negative media. Whereas with stability we have no bad media?
@_date: 2014-11-01 23:45:58
The fact is by that point people will already hold the bits beyond the 300 so therefore making value go up due to demand I.e. Not enough supple available for demand
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:16:28
1) only checked price with coindesk 2) they only quote those saying negative things that don't mention anything about the fact of how much is invested in infrastructure 3) happy to mention price was $1,200 but not what the price was last year before the rise .... 
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:36:02

Can look at peer-to-peer lending like bitlendingclub 
@_date: 2014-09-22 09:04:33
I think this losses credibility as soon as you see 'MT gox chart' you really can't be using something that no longer exists to base a future prediction. If you do use it then you are saying btc will go as a whole the same way.
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:46:22
For me safety first so all on cold storage and have paper wallets encrypted and balance spread over a couple of wallets. Just need to make sure you are aware which btc wallets for your phone can decrypt encrypted paper wallets as not all can.
@_date: 2014-12-13 00:46:13
What im getting at is it to people to react to the news. The news outright didnt do anything. The news doesnt buy or sell the coins the news influences people who then decide
@_date: 2014-11-29 09:18:51
If you buy real estate though you are still selling your stake granted for brick and mortar and not fiat however the seller may sell your coins. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:20:35
From UK and in my area there is only 1-2 people within 1 hour drive. Sorry my plan isnt to short its simply to make money. Localbitcoin has a great markup vs exchanges so has a bigger margin. Otherwise for the time you put into it its not worth it.
The advice is much appreciated everyone! 
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:53:39
What is meant is someone could have 10 wallets and transfer something between them all day everyday. Multiply this by 1m people and those figures become incorrect and not a true reflection

... Closely followed by a 465btc movement

@_date: 2014-09-19 18:51:45
Would that not disrupt those buying coins as would be less available therefore push up price?

The wall is back. $1.1m at 360.69 per btc. Order is for 3100 btcs
@_date: 2014-11-13 08:35:36
I was using that as a made up example to say why you shouldn't use it. Every time any coins move its 1 transaction. Everyday people will move coins between wallets not just people buying them. That therefore fluctuates the figure.
@_date: 2014-09-22 07:03:57
Just bear in mind that if you encrypt your paper wallet you require a phone app that is comparable to unlock it, not all do but mycelium is the best I have found

Bitlendingclub is a good us based version of this and requires those seeking a loan to give a lot of information to get rid of fraud. I have personally used it myself for a week and so long as your good and still to guidelines you set out you shouldnt have problem with someone not paying

@_date: 2014-12-12 18:35:58
Agreed. 
Those books though that you can see is just like reading a website saying Microsoft are taking btc.
It all boils down to how many coins are bought vs sold
@_date: 2014-10-21 11:17:00
The comment I think about using card details on a pc vs a private key is a massive plus point, one that should be jumped upon. Just think the amount in $ that online fraud is from viruses picking up card details

@_date: 2014-09-22 17:58:15
Use a very small amount first to trial it out. I used 3$ worth 2-3 times before I then moved everything. Have a wallet on your phone - buy btc on exchange and send to phone address - from phone address send a little to paper wallet - sweep cold storage (I.e. Take coins back from paper wallet) to phone - if comfortable with process send all to paper wallet or do another small run
@_date: 2014-09-12 10:31:33

@_date: 2014-09-11 18:19:07

Fair dues. I would be jumping for joy if I got in that early. For me I just think theres too much infrastructure in btc for it too disappear. I think this might be a "wipe the slate clean" time
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:18:15
Remember there is no fees on bitstamp at the mo whereas they are well known normally for high ones. That will get them more volume/bigger share of the market
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:14:28
Or zigzag which can use at local corner shops
@_date: 2015-01-17 23:34:04
Should post this in the BitcoinUk subreddit as I think it will be useful for everyone to see (im uk myself)
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:38:36
Granted bitstamp hasnt helped it but its certain not damaged as much as Mt Gox because it shows lessons learnt. Bitstamp can and will survive this so others can learn and build upon it etc. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:33:21
What gd does posting a pic of btc crashing do on here? It doesnt bring about much people are not already aware of. I believe some even call it trolling
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:37:35
For me yes. It has its issues but I think cyrpocurrency will be like search engines. Anyone could try to make a competitor but Google will always trump them
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:47:09
This has already been posted about 10 times from different sources buddy 
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:41:30
Did you sell any at 1100?
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:36:29
What site was this? I have been following the order book at bitstamp and its besn constantly changing but the volume of orders are low vs normal
@_date: 2015-01-01 12:09:32
Its good to finally see this being put in news rather than on chatrooms 
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:13:58
Or bitbargain
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:31:15
Do bear in mind that its customers cpins so they need to keep x amount in hot wallet and the fact Bitstamp is seen as one of the biggest exchanges hence targeting them. Cannot compare to Mt Gox tho as they have in the 100,000btc on cold storage. They did the correct thing in taking time to publish a statement as they wanted to ensure the attack was done and report correctly the damage
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:11:32
Use Bitbargain or Bittylious pal. Both require ID documents tho. Im UK myself and used both
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:05:40
Out of interest do you see this as an investment and if so whats your "sell" price?
@_date: 2014-12-21 12:04:47
I believe his wallet wasn't encrypted
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:41:14
Did you write this? If so have you had to collect a late loan?
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:39:13
LocalBitcoin is the very quickest. After than UK exchanges but you need to be verified to get decent amount. LocalBitcoin will be above the market rate at the moment tho
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:58:31
Used this yourself?
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:10:42
No one knows as price is back under 200 now
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:06:47
Bad as dumps coins back on market. For market to stay the same the person who has bought goods with btc needs to replenish their coins
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:07:49
Means its swt for 40% increase next year at least ;)
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:24:09
Why bother going to the effort to actually post this?
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:13:52
Seems to be an in between address almost in that no coins stay there longer than a day its straight in then straight out
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:43:47
Russia is small fish for btc a block wont achieve much. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 07:18:06
Cheers for the tip buddy. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:48:25
For me this has more relevance than half the trolling posts on here
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:55:01
No worries pal
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:13:53
A lot of rumours they are very mt gox like create fake coins to be on the market which in turn manipulates the market
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:02:23
They are also mass buying gold
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:40:13
Or you could sell on LocalBitcoin. You are able to charge a premium as you dont need ID documents to buy/sell
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:07:21
Next gold standard currency if any will be Russia. Wouldnt say $ is gold standard though buddy they trade in opposite ways for starters
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:47:01
Its a ticking timebomb with its debt and its policy makers happy to go a printing run ...
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:59:52
Still something bigger and better than speculation buddy 
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:43:52
Skynews is first major news outlet ive seen report last couple of days
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:42:15
That was linked to a phishing site not long ago
@_date: 2017-01-17 09:20:01
Thank you.
Wondering if their is any correlation between volume and price i.e. price is always x of volume in bubbles
@_date: 2017-01-17 09:16:41
You do however need to upload ID to be able to buy more btc. You start with restrictions on account
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:09:21
Bittylious or coinbase
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:21:09
Got the btc now!
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:21:53
Im in same sitaution in that I sent money from my GBP coinbase wallet to my BTC coinbase wallet.
Shows pending but following rhe blockchain its been at that address I sent it to but by blockchain not their anymore.
Its gone onto another account but my coinbase BTC wallet shows no further transaction
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:28:39
My belief was that from my GBP wallet if you transfer the funds into BTC wallet with them they auto transfer those funds into btc.
Looking at account history that side of it happened which blockchain showing it with 50+ confirmations that the address of my BTC wallet got the coins.
Coinbase shows the btc deposit into my btc wallet as pending.
My alarm bells went tho when I saw the BTC had moved onto that other account I didnt know/seen before
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:25:59
Im in same situation except I transferred funds from my Coinbase GBP wallet to my coinbase BTC wallet.
Blockchain shows it happened and when reached my btc wallet moved onto another wallet.
That "moved onto another wallet" doesnt show on my btc wallet transactions and on coinbase website in history it shows as pending
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:28:00
Its on the trading book. Its not one trade its several around same price of 297-300 so looks a big wall 
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:12:44
The fact they are going to stop using the $ for trades I.e. im no longer going to buy $100m worth of oil from Russia but instead use another currency. If that became widely adopted US losses its global currency power. Therefore investors will move money from $ to say the yen 
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:48:07
Interested? 
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:01:38
Given how btc is widely quoted in $ and this is talking about weakening of the $ I think it has enough relevance
@_date: 2015-02-16 12:17:47
If you bothered to read the article pal its nothing to do with btc
