I guess my question is what's the difference between Coinbase &amp; Coinbase Pro? Other than the fees and the layout?
@_date: 2018-09-21 07:32:28
That's awesome. You're awesome. Thank you for your help :) 
@_date: 2018-09-25 01:01:34
And you aren't hit with the 1.4% fee?
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:29:03
Got Coinbase pro. I have a question: why is cheaper? Am I missing something, I feel there has to be a catch?
@_date: 2018-09-21 07:14:13
Really? Coinbase's FAQ said you can't do that, that's why I started looking for other options.  
How do you buy and sell on a paper wallet? What website do you use? 
Thanks for the help! 
@_date: 2018-09-25 01:13:43
Really? Cause I can't make my Coinbase app see my Pro account. I'm so confused 
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:39:18
Beautiful. Thank you :)

I don't mind the small fees. My main problem is as the market keeps moving in 3% up/down from 6200 to 6500 it makes the 1.4% fee from Coinbase a hinderance to buy and sell as it goes up down. That's basically what I'm trying to work around. How do you trade right now? Or is everyone just in full hodl?

Hu, would you look at that! So I guess my next question is how do sell off your paper wallet? 
@_date: 2018-09-25 02:47:51
Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-09-25 00:38:26
So there is an app for Pro? Not regular Coinbase, but the pro version?
@_date: 2018-10-05 05:36:58
Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-10-01 16:01:12
Could you post a link? I found like 8 ticket apps. Please &amp; thank you

I'm getting better at it. All things with time and research. I've taught myself much more complicated things than this. I have faith that I learn a lot and THEN go totally broke haha.
Besides, it's fun. When you catch a candle up it makes you get a boner like you wouldn't believe. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 05:24:16
Oh I suck at it! I keep losing money!!! Hahah. But not as much if I wasn't selling when I think it's going to bottom and buying back in, which, is why I wanna short. I'm basically shorting anyway, just the stupid way atm. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 04:51:36
My shorting it has nothing to do with it crashing. It's crashing on its own. Why not make your Bitcoin into more Bitcoin on the way down. I'm shorting to strengthen my hodl position down the road. 
I believe in Bitcoin as tool to destroy the banks, etc. but holding it as it plummets doesn't help anyone, especially my faith in Bitcoin. It will rally. The bulls will be back. But it's a bear now and I want to double my holdings as it bottoms and buy more when it's done busting. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 05:55:17
Ah, yes. Thank you. Same thing as longing while the price tanks I suppose. Though with a short gone bad theoretically you could lose more money than you have. Do I have that right? 
@_date: 2018-11-17 06:13:34
You sound like you don't even like Cyrpto? Haha.
I have been long on no leverage. I've basically been buying the lows and selling the highs which is why I'm now interested in shorting because I'm sort of shorting, just backward. Seems easier and better to call the top and ride it down then call the bottom and ride it up, especially since this market has way more bottom to go before it rallies. I don't see even one bullish indicator. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 05:30:04
What do you mean don't short if you can't long?
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:49:59
Yay!!! You have to pay for that VPN though, it seems?
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:02:44
Oh, yeah. But that's the fun. Catch them falling knives like a sword swallower from hades :) 
 
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:08:29
Hahahahaha.... you're a funny clever one. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:48:46
Omg please tell more or send a link. And is that legal? Does everyone do that? 
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:55:25
Which VPN do you use? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:10:11
Fun! I love those!!!
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:07:33


is that legal? If you get caught, what happens?
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:54:29
The free version doesn't let you change your location. I'm fucking with Kraken and it seems to be okay. Smaller leverage amounts but that seems like a good thing. 25x leverage is insane. Do you know anything about Kraken? It seems solid, just less features and less leverage options 
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:00:49
Rough waters? You mean in crypto in general or Kraken specifically?
