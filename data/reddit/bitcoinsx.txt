last you hear because the media wants to black it out - this is big news buddy! SWIFT is the whole financial system software and it has a security vulnerability. That is not good.

lol - please don't put my on the same level as drudge - I simply like his website layout :) and in this day of age it is hard to keep it simple which is what I am trying to do here. simple and effective. break through all the clutter news and give you a good resource for your daily bitcoin digest, ya know?
@_date: 2016-04-25 19:46:44
wow this is big news!

he is an opinionated character to say the least

yes don't do either of those - very risky. just buy it from coinbase, move it to your phone and hold it in your phone wallet like bread. boom you are invested.

take away the logo on on big news media sites and can you tell them apart? now look at the latter... that is my reason why I think this design layout is so effective. same thing w bitcoin, take away the logo and colors, do you know if you are looking at coindesk, coinreport, cryptocoinnews, bitcoinist, newsbtc, etc.. thats why I formatted it this way... it's also simple html and hand edited each day, I am trying to only include relevant, and good articles... I wanted to wake up each morning and goto a site like this to get my own info and instead ended up creating one and sharing it with my friends and now, thanks to reddit, a lot more people :)

Cool thanks

Of course I do?! Why would I have to do that? I don't think you understand how the addresses work exactly. You can use one address and accept unlimited payments to it. You don't need to change it every time. Hope that clears it up for you and others with that misunderstanding. And thanks for reading my article.

wow can't believe he said that about his own company... very strange

just scan the qr code into bread where it says import wallet
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:53:37
it doesn't matter which application made the keys, any wallet should be able to import your private key and fund you new wallet. try bread wallet and import the private key. let me know
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:09:09
coinbase \- or inside breadwallet \- use glidera
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:06:20
im scared to check my account &amp; they have had a warning up in the admin for a long long time... not like i keep anything in there... just saying to all the people w frozen accounts \- they let you know its been coming for a long time...

This watch is actually pretty cool with private key backup and public key on the face
