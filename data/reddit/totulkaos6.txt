The FBI supposedly auctioned those coins from Silk Road didn't they?

I'm part of the 99%, are you saying I'm not experiencing inflation?
A can of soup was $1.50 like 2-3 years ago. They're $3 bucks now.  And I live in a state and work for a state government where there's been a freeze on our yearly pay increments for almost 4 years now...I haven't had a raise in 4 years!
So soup prices have gone up tremendously and my salary has stayed the same....the inflation is real for me, fuck all the bullshit economic models and stats that even "experts" don't understand and just bullshit acting like they know what they talk about.  
In reality I'm being fucked by inflation.  Im poorer now than when I was first hired at my job 7 years ago.  You'd think you're lot in life would
Improve as you work and get older, nope.  Not in my reality.

Yeah seriously the people who have sold at a loss and are trying to justify it....I mean you have just made the  most cliche mistake you can possibly make in investing....you fucked up.
The market is 100% going to recover, probably stronger than before....do you seriously think cyrpto is gonna crash to $0....do you all seriously think this crash means the end of cyrpto....cause that's the only way you can possibly justify selling and attempting to salvage what you can.
I mean god it's so obvious it's going to recover, who knows how long it'll take, a week?  A month?  A year?  Who knows, but cyrpto is def going no where  at least not now, and the market will 100% recover from this...
If you bought high and sold low you fucked up, oldest mistake in the book.

Best interviewers ask the tough questions.
I'd rather see real discussion and debate than a bunch of fluff like a sports post game press conference

Yes, and that's the most likely scenario with satoshi.  He's dead and didn't pass along his keys or he lost the keys and cannot access.
No one knows for sure but it's pretty unbelievable that none of his 1 million btc has ever moved.  In the early days sure, believable he woulda held.  But I simply can't believe there is anybody who could sit on 15-16 billion dollars and not do something with at least a small portion of them.

Not nearly as many as you would think or what a lot of the claims on these crypto subs would have you think.

Hahahah man this is disgusting.  The judge talks about being narrow minded?  Could she be any more naive and narrow minded herself?  The fucking U.S. governments stance on drugs is the reason places like Afghanistan and Mexico are fucking rampant, not fucking Silk Road you fucking government crony bitch.

The overwhelming majority of people who are rich and or successful owe the overwhelming majority of that wealth and success to luck. 
There are very, very....very few people in history who deserve a lot of credit for their accomplishments. For the most part peoples' accomplishments are owed to variables outside their control.  Circumstance.
The old, right place right time.

I mean doesn’t it get to a point where all these mysterious “whales” simply accumulate too much and essentially defeat themselves by making it it worth nothing cause nobody owns it but them...?

It's just because Bitcoin was first.  It was first and essentially fortified it's brand well.
Litecoin for instance is essentially Bitcoin but better in every way.   It's adopted new technology before Bitcoin every step of the way.
It's just litecoin isn't as well known as Bitcoin.

I mean aren't we pretty much there?
I know theres people who have at least 1 full Bitcoin but I honestly don't know anyone in real life that does.  All the people I know own fractions of a coin, and maybe they have positions in some other cyrptos, but yeah I don't know anyone is real life that owns even 1 full coin.
1 coin is already so expensive it's out of reach for probably 90% of people can't afford to buy a whole coin.
And as the price get higher and higher obtaining a full coin only becomes more and more out of reach.

Well crypto has a long way to go then considering the  dot-com crash saw like roughly 2 trillion disappear...
The total crypto market cap isn’t 1 trillion yet, what’s it at now?  Like 500 billion...?

Well I’m not a usaa member, but my buddy is.  
I hadn’t heard of this, pretty sure my buddy hasn’t either.
So I’ve been informed, and I’ll probably inform my friend...
Gain some perspective.  You’re experience isn’t everyone’s.

So what happening later or within next few days??  Futures contracts closing or something???
Some sort of manipulation, that’s obvious, we’ll be back to 6500 by the end of the week if not much sooner

The person is either dead or lost the coins.  Those are the most likely scenarios.

Hahaha damn $30k into an investment that’s been on the decline for a year and been in an absolute nose dive for a month with little to no signs of a turn around anytime soon.....amazing 
I’m not saying crypto won’t rebound at some point and go to new ATH, maybe it will, but goddamn you should of bought in slowly over time...not $30k all at fucking once in the midst of free fall....your investment is gonna be worth $15k in a week and no guarantee, far from it actually, that it’s ever gonna moon again....
Just don’t understand how someone can claim to spend 80% of their free time for a year researching this shit and still make such risky wreckless move....
