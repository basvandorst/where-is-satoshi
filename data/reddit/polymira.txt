I sold over 120 just before this started =(
@_date: 2011-10-20 03:37:24
ACH? This was a cash deposit into a bank account... I've emailed customer service and they say they are looking into it, they asked for a scan of the deposit slip ... but you don't get to keep a copy once you hand it over to the teller. I wish I could go back and take a photo of the thing. Crossing my fingers. This is supposed to be a "up to 1 business day, and in the future, one hour" type of transaction as per the website. It's been well over a business day. In the US, and in Hong Kong.
@_date: 2011-10-20 00:18:30
I deposited $210 via chase bank 29 hours ago and it's still not in my account. Starting to get reaaaallly worried.
@_date: 2011-10-21 20:34:29
Wow man, betting you wish you would have sold a bunch in June/July?
@_date: 2011-10-20 04:52:19
We'll see, the guy that's looking into it for me didn't leave me hopeless. He says they are waiting on a bulk transaction for the past few days from Chase and I'll get my credit then. I gave a photo of my reciept, time, dollar amount, and date of the transaction.
@_date: 2013-08-21 21:09:14
I'm hoping any others can weigh in on this that haven't received their refunds to date. I'm 90% sure I provided information regarding my savings account, which I'm afraid could be the issue. So if anyone else can provide some input, that may be helpful when I email bitfloor support again next week.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:59:40
It doesn't sound like he ever got coins. Just some refunds that were less then he sent them.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:25:07
I only sent anything over there today is because there are no fee's until tomorrow night. Figured i'd trade around a bit since I never had.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:44:08
Maybe, but if you log in you still get the message. It'll be down until tonight.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:00:14
Who do they owe BTC to ?
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:02:07
Or to transfer the funds back to your bank account and eat the fee you paid to deposit. And them wire transfer to mtgox.
Just buy BTC on bitfloor when you like the price you see.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:34:12
Do you happen to have a sell order open? That will put your BTC on hold
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:10:03
Since the $1.25 days, I bought hundreds but spent them the same day.
I have .89 left over in my wallet right now.
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:15:58
No, no one has.
They still haven't even found a bank that will open an account for them. It doesn't help that Roman (founder/owner) is couch surfing on the west coast. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:59:55
Only reason I moved some coin from Bitfloor over to gox today, so i can play around and not worry too much.
@_date: 2013-08-22 01:36:48
I agree. But there has to be a reason for the hold up. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:15:50
Yeah, I did mine an hour ago. I literally had the funds in my bitfloor account within 5min. I was blown away. The last time I've done a cash deposit into an exchance was chase bank into mt gox over a year ago, and that took 3-5 days.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:45:08
Nope, still down..
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:52:54
$400 for $20 worth of BTC?
Am I reading the correctly? Lol.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:05:56
.10 on a very lucky pool.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:50:36
I thought a check was already issued?
I'm just hoping I get my $1000+ back before the end of June... If ever.
@_date: 2013-08-21 17:24:25
Op – did you set up your direct deposit into a checking account or savings?  Trying to figure out why the few of us are different than the majority. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:41:50
I think the big uptick in 1 year+ days destroyed would be BTC spiking at such a high price. Those people made a shit ton of money, and wanted to get cash before today happened.
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:26:18
Shit, I had a $98 sell order that went through automatically an hour or so ago.
I have a bit over $1000 in there right now... I'm worried.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:21:43
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:23:26
It's possible with MtGox getting DDOS'd and lagging severely, this could be affecting transfers.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:32:29
This has been posted at least 25 times in the past day. We know.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:41:48
I believe someone started today. I'm on mobile so I'm not sure if I got it right.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:13:56
No, you'll have USD in your account and can place BTC orders at will.
@_date: 2013-09-30 03:47:04
Negative. Nothing beyond AudenX's emails. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:22:29
Sure you can.
A scam, a Trojan on a pc with an unencrypted wallet, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:37:35
I have 0.89, leftovers from when I was buying .. things ... with bitcoin a bit over a year ago.
It's absolutely disgusting to think I had 330BTC in my wallet when the price was under $2USD.
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:27:46
I'm still waiting on a bit over 1k. The best part is, the amount no longer shows up in my bitfloor account, but I don't have it.
Bitfloor support email did respond to me on this the other day, saying that if I don't have it in 2 weeks to email them again..
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:42:40
Same here.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:31:14
Yeah, $30 to $1, i bought at $1.80 ... spent them at $2 .... all 300 some off of them.
I have regrets.
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:37:48
Could it? Sure. Could it drop back to $1? Sure.
No one knows.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:43:26
Sign up at bitfloor, setup a deposit, go to a local bank of america branch and make a deposit. It'll be in your account before you get home.
@_date: 2013-08-01 19:48:52
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:50:39
Was likely told a check was being issues, and them told it wasn't. It can happen.
The lack of updates sucks for those of us who would like our money though.
@_date: 2013-08-16 06:30:37
Thanks Auden, I emailed support earlier today, and I suppose I'll keep emailing them every couple of days until I get something solid back. I'm glad I messaged you the amount previously, as I didn't have it logged anywhere else down to the penny.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:05:43
Still is telling me that trading is suspended.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:21:27
With a high of $266 this morning.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:49:35
I get more than that on one 7970, what Mhash are you getting? I get about 650 on one card.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:39:24
I missed out because I was dumb, had $1,000 in my bitfloor account when BTC was steady at $70, but I kept expecting it to drop back down to 50 or so.
Not dumb actually, just careful.
@_date: 2013-08-13 02:32:04
Same here, crossing my fingers to have my cash this week!
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:15:31
I'm buying up 75 coins as much as I can right now.
It'll go back up.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:14:45
Did this today for the first time, seriously had my funds by the time I got to my car in the bank parking lot. Blew me away. 
You DO need to verify yourself (well, attach a photo ID) to transfer USD out to a bank account with bitfloor, but you could always transfer the BTC to another exchange to cash out I suppose.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:33:21
Why not just have an offline wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:39:49
Except the go to Mt Gox which is closed today. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 02:33:51
Tweet at bit floor and Romans personal account.  I'm on  mobile,  but I think it's  or something similar. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:05:02
I just deposited money into bitfloor at a local Bank of America branch. I had the confirmation email before I got back to my car.
@_date: 2013-09-20 15:54:02
I'm in the exact same boat as you.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:30:09
I feel like I'm becoming a shill for bitfloor on this sub today...
But yeah, bitfloor, good experience, $1,000 deposited and was in my account by the time i left bank of america. $16 fee.
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:16:29
Nothing so far, just a note on their website saying they have our money and are figuring out how to get it to us...
No emails, no further updates. I really could use that money right now.
I really wish they could just post some real information.... "Working on getting a new direct deposit solution going with a new bank!" ... or "We will be working with Dwolla to get your money back in your hands" ... fucking anything really.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:38:42
Sent some to bitfloor from mtgox today, a bit over an hour.
@_date: 2013-08-15 23:04:19
As of right now I show a $0.00 balance in my bitfloor account (I'm owed a bit over $1,000), however I still haven't received a refund.
I think something went wrong, and I haven't a clue who to talk to for help. Bitfloor twitter told me to email support, but i haven't really heard good things about hearing back from the support email.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:44:39
It's bouncing around pretty hectic like. I wouldn't freak out in either direction at the moment. Anything can happen over the next few hours.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:39:38
@_date: 2013-06-11 02:10:45
Not in the Bay Area, but close enough that I just may! (I'm in Chico)
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:41:24
All of those people who spent a few hundred on blow when BTC was $1USD are kicking themselves in the ass.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:16:56
No, this morning at $266USD would have literally been the worst time to buy.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:25:44
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:40:52
No, no they aren't.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:31:56
Have you received an electricity bill yet?
@_date: 2013-09-30 03:19:09
Got mine in the mail (paper check) over the weekend.
Blew my mind.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:46:02
I'm only seeing options at bitinstant to go directly to MtGox, no option to send to a wallet address.... I believe they removed that recently.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:41:53
Trading has stopped indefinitely.
I would get in line and get your USD while it remains possible.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:19:53
I'm not worried, I haven't bought bitcoin since it was $2 or so, so this thing is profit regardless. Was just hoping to get from .89 to a cool 1BTC tonight.
I'm gonna put some actual cash in and buy some real coin tomorrow (I tried to get in tonight through cash deposit, but going from one bank after work to pull out funds and then go to the other bank to deposit, got there 2min after closing).
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:56:35
I bought in the 90s, 80's, and 70's today.
I regret nothing.
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:53:36
That's just not possible. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:55:19
Thank you audenx! When I get my funds back, I'll be tipping the shit out of you.
Do you know when you'll have another communication with the lawyer?
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:43:44
email support .... but expect a delay, I'm sure that inbox is going batshit.
@_date: 2013-07-06 19:41:13
Thank you so so so so much AudenX. I really believe that this wouldn't have happened without the pressure, research, and suggestions that came directly from you.
Once we get our money back, we really need to set something up for northern california redditors to take you out for drinks.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:47:08
Log into MtGox, click on "Funding Options" on the left, and then select Bitcoins from the drop down. This will give you the bitcoin address to send to, copy this.
From coinbase help:




@_date: 2013-04-12 20:45:26
Were they on hold right off the bat, or do you have a limit order that hasn't been filled?
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:14:35
I'm getting ready to go out for the night, was planning on putting a sell through before I leave...
I don't know how I feel about having $500 in BTC hanging out on mtgox overnight this weekend =/
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:59:40
No, it gives you the info to write on the deposit slip 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:37:39
Ouch. MtGox's support tickets take a while to get back to you, especially if you're in the US due to timezone issues.
When they took Chase Bank deposits, I had a deposit that wasn't showing after a week, in the hundreds. I was upset and it took days for a response.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:34:45
I sent to bitfloor earlier...
Was there at 6 confirmations, immediately. Time to give mtgox a rest until/if they get their shit together.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:40:13
A lot.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:45:02
You don't need an account.
But yeah, sorry, timezones are a bitch :)
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:12:27
I just pm'd you as well!
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:54:05
Wow, this sucks. I was seriously hoping to have my money before this time next month...
I think we will be lucky to have anything by Autumn from the way things seem to be going.
I can't even get a new phone until this is all resolved as I have two factor auth turned on, and there's no way to turn it off...
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:11:26
You login to your bitfloor account, click on deposit, put in the deposit amount, and it will give you the account information and exact amount to write on the deposit slip. Go to bank, fill out slip, hand over money, and you're ready to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:06:44
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:58:05
No. There's plenty of money in overpriced cocaine and MDMA.
@_date: 2013-08-16 23:11:00
I recieved the following response, hoping I don't have to wait two weeks to follow up on this with them. "We will look into your refund request and see if the funds were not returned correctly. If you do not see your refund within two weeks, please follow up again." 
@_date: 2013-08-13 19:13:55
Dang,  still nothing here. 
I think I put my savings account information in when submitting to bitfloor instead of checking ...  Hoping that isn't what's holding it up. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:06:16
Cash or wire transfer, PayPal and credit card transactions can be reversed, while bitcoin transactions can't.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:09:48
Shitty thing, I was trying to sell .89 bitcoin an hour ago on bitfloor ... but my transfer from my wallet to them is taking forever .... first 4 confirmations took 15min, now an hour later I have 5 as I watch the price plummet.
@_date: 2013-06-10 20:40:11
I"m fine with providing whoever my information that needs it to get my money (over $1k) back...
Do you think they may actually be able to start issuing refunds in the coming weeks? Or is that completely speculative at this point? I submitted for ACH verification after Bitfloor went down, but it's been in the never-ending "pending" status since.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:26:16
This would be worth the many thousands in cost to have a professional data recovery company try to pull data from those platters.
@_date: 2013-08-21 15:30:54
Same, waiting on just over $1000. My funds don't even show up in my bitfloor account anymore. I emailed support, and was told to contact them again in two weeks if I don't still have my money. This was last week.
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:13:36
I didn't realize you could do verification without withdrawing at the same time. I would have verified a week ago.
I submitted a copy of my ID and my bank account info today. If I get my money it'll likely take a couple of weeks minimum considering how long the line is.
And to think, I was excited for a minute that my sale for $98 a pop went though, as it put me ahead.
@_date: 2013-07-26 17:52:32
Has any of the under $3,000 people recieved their refunds? I'm only hearing about the IAFCU ones at this point.
Still waiting on my $1,000.
@_date: 2013-06-10 21:07:52
Thank you audenx!
I don't have any BTC right now, but if you have a paypal, I would love to send you a donation. You've done so much for so many of us.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:57:39
Appreciate the response! I doubt we will have anything by Friday, considering that Roman is couch surfing in the bay area for the rest of the month.
