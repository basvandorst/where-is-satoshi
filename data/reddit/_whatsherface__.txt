I love everyone here too.. everyone is generally respectful and doesn’t get irritated when others blurt out the price ...  I even get to pm someone here in this sub that doesn’t say “so what” when I say what the price is... lol.... I refresh, check the prices and set way to many alerts.  Lol

I had a little of my coin in my vault at the time on coinbase..  I been having it since 2012 does that still count and will I  still receive btc when they release it? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:00:35
 here is something I think will help..  
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:12:27
Hi.   I saw this article on this blog. 
Below is some of that article..
“Customers with bitcoin balances stored on Coinbase at the time of the fork will have access to bitcoin on both blockchains. There is no action required from customers and bitcoin can be securely stored on Coinbase before, during, and after the fork. After the fork, we will enable access when we have determined each blockchain is secure and stable. We expect this to happen within a few days after the fork, but it may take longer if additional risks emerge.”
