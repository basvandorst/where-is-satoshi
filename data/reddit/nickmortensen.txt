“If you can’t explain something clearly, it means you don’t understand it.”
Definitely not wrong about that, which is why he should spend the $12 for a domain name. Maybe I am too old school, but  I tend to not take anyone seriously about anything tech or presentation related when they base their content at a domain with "Wordpress" or "blogspot" inside.  It is like having a ".biz" top level domain.  You might as well write it in a 'zine  and  thumbtack it on the cork board of your local laundromat next to the "We Buy Houses" flyers.
This is relevant because it calls into question his legitimacy as an author rather than acknowledge the merit of the content the author writes. Lack of a dedicated domain name is damaging to his ability to explain something clearly.    Which, of course, speaks to his point.  Remove the obstacles if you want to be understood. 
Not saying Wordpress is a lousy place to host your blog. Just saying $12 a year for your own domain name set to your Wordpress blog is the way to go if you want to be a thought leader.

It'd probably be smarter for these large companies to buy heavily into an existing crypto that doesn't have the value of BTC and subsequently announce their acceptance of that crypto.   
I may not be thinking it all the way through, but if they bought up a couple million Worldcoin (Has some value, decent PR team built in) and announced they would accept it as payment, it'd easily double current market value.  If they went the same route with BTC, it'd only see a rise of  a few percent.

I always thought God Shamgod would've been the one from that Providence squad to play ten years in the NBA. Austin Croshere owes him a debt of gratitude.

I've wondered that myself. The best answer I can come up with is the massive difference in volume between the two exchanges.  That doesn't account for why CampBX is always the lower of the two, though.

I thought that was a killer save of his dog.   I like that guy.

I felt that John Woo's analysis lacked in substance, but had style for days.  I especially enjoyed how he was able to deploy his signature slow-motion doves and double-fisted shooting of 9mm guns.  I felt it was a little ham-fisted that he managed to shoehorn a cameo from Chow Yun-Fat into his Bitcoin analysis, but I suppose you have to dance with who brought you and his loyalty is admirable.

Sorry to hear it.  Should be a good warning to not take delivery at one's residence or not run the rig at the place where you take delivery.  If you are running a rig, beef up your insurance package and your security.  Having your residence robbed is a super demoralizing experience.

I have used Dwolla in the past.  More of my friends use it than know what Bicoin is, but that owes itself to it starting in Iowa and us living in Wisconsin. I think it got marketed to college students in Wisconsin fairly early on.  I wish people would use it instead of Paypal.  It is nuts that they don't

That teacher is out of line.   I doubt it is about you, so take the "back away slowly" approach.   Do whatever it takes to get as far away from her as possible.  Confronting these people only forces them to dig in.  Even if you were able to show her how wrong she is for not being clear about what she wanted - she'll just move the goalposts on you like she already has.   
You can always tell the people that have very little power in the world by how frequently they feel the need to inform people exactly what that power is.

I'm in the exact boat you are in.  I have mostly lost hope of seeing my $1k again, but this thread has given me some hope.  I'll look at the safe return of my deposit as found money.

I recognized the template as well.  What do you wanna bet Atlantis didn't pay for the commercial license?  
I hope this doesn't gain traction.  It won't help Bitcoin if it is thought to facilitate illegal transactions.

The Obverse to this hostility is the idea that Apple accepting an app or two friendly to a different crypto currency would have a much more significant  impact on the value of that coin.  
I imagine someone with a lot of early coins would have to grease a few palms for this to happen.  Maybe Sunny King would have to materialize.  When does Charles Lee's exit clause for not working with Apple end?  
Oh yeah, Ripple.   This deal is probably all but announced.  
Apple doesn't make any stupid moves when it comes to money.   They've already got 500 million of our recently updated credit card information.   Bitcoin hostility is because they wouldn't make any percent of the transfer.  No doubt they have a competitor in the hopper as part of their currently useless passport app.  Find out what it is and figure out how you can make some loot from it.    Money is changing.

Downloaded.  I like it. My only suggestion is to use .SVG for the graphics - but that's only because I looked at it on an iPad and magnified it to reveal pixelation. Hardly a criticism and not a particularly fair one at that. 
How did you decide on the bulldog graphic? I see the obvious "watch" aspect, but was wondering whether there was any other significance.

They are readying it for a sale.   Any buyer doing due diligence would want to determine the value of Dwolla (or their parent entity) apart from Bitcoin in terms of how much revenue it generates.  That is how they would determine whether it was worth purchasing.   
I'd say dimes to dollars the buyer is one of those Bitcoin exchanges that is either new to market or soon to open and has deep pockets on account of their Venture Capitalists.    You'd have a competitive advantage if you were the only Bitcoin exchange that people were able to utilize Dwolla with.

Told the guys in my Fantasy Football League  that I'd set them up with a trading account on BTC-E and transfer Bitcoin  or Litecoin into it for 20% less than the previous day's low  price on BTC-E - up to $500 USD.   Told them they could send the money via PayPal, I'd show them how to set up ACH transfers from any online trading account and  they could  decide to use or they could immediately sell the crypto at market value and transfer the USD out and I wouldn't get mad.   Also told them I'd personally guarantee whatever loss either crypto takes in the next 6 months if they decide to leave it in or trade with it -meaning if the value of their holding went down to $0, I'd cover it.   Also told them I was open to any arrangement that required them to shell out their money initially so that they'd pay attention moreso than if I just gave it to them.   
So far, the only one who has expressed any interest is the guy that writes critically acclaimed novels and also wrote a couple of episodes for the F/X show "The Bridge"  -Pat Somerville.   I hope he pulls the trigger.   He has the kind of juice to write something about the experiment in any number of fairly high end national publications and the kind of talent to explain crypto in a way the influential readers that would likely read his work would understand.     I love that I went to high school with that dude.   
No word from the other ten guys in my league yet, but I will either be happy to turn them on to crypto in the most painless way imaginable or lustily enjoy tormenting them with the theoretical returns they could have gotten on a zero risk investment for the rest of my days.

Definitely a barrier for entry, but I've had a good experience with CampBX.

Get a domain name and I'll check it out.  Nothing that has Wordpress in the domain name adds any legitimacy to anything.

One friend did take me up on it.  Gave him 125 litecoin  on November 5 for (10) post-dated checks for 2014 @ 40 each.  He sold them at $44 a couple days ago after at least two weeks of me bribing him not to ("I'll give you any losses you take if LTC doesn't hit $50 by the end of the month!).   The decline from $50 sent him into a panic, but how can you argue with that sort of growth in 3 weeks? 
He now wants to send me the $400 back, but I think I will have him pass it along to someone of his choosing.   To me, this is the only real way to convince people about Bitcoin - it sounds too much like a fever dream or a scam otherwise.  Honestly, rightfully so. The last few weeks have been a wet dream.

Perhaps check Alibaba for hologram stickers. US prices aren't that great comparatively and the ones with a 2-3 week lead time are just resellers of the places you'll find on Alibaba anyhow.

I started in May 2013, using a primer from one of the Gawker blogs about getting into Bitcoin.   I had my bank wire $1000 from my tax return to Bitfloor - which promptly closed and took my money with it.  
It was an inauspicious beginning for me, but I decided to keep trying with Dwolla and CampBX and I am glad I did. 
I mostly lost money until I read they busted Silk Road and took 30,000 Bitcoin as evidence.   I figured that taking 30,000 BTC out of play meant the ones that were in play would become worth more.   A rare good call in BTC for me and things have been smooth sailing ever since.  Fun to be able to make hay while the sun is shining.   Ever aware that this cannot possibly last, but happy to ride it out while it does.

You are truly a legend. For at least two oft friends, your story is the only thing they know about Bitcoin.   Glad it worked out for you.

Transaction fees are a bear for any business with an accounts receivable department.  I work for a custom sign manufacturer and we actually will give a discount to not pay us with a credit card. 
That is your in point anywhere.  Also, just saying you accept Bitcoin as a payment is enough to get a blurb in the local newspaper.

Howard Dean and the CNBC anchors kept referring to it as "Bitcoins".  That speaks to a certain lack of comprehension on the subject.  
They discussed the prospect of the Koch Bros using it to further skirt the election campaign contribution rules. That can't be bad for the prospect of Bitcoin values increasing.

That's cool to know.  I'm always fascinated by the decisions and meanings behind app choices.  Are you on Github? I'm not quite to the developer stage in my education, but I am able to look in on other people's code and understand.

Used Bitfloor before them.  Still waiting on the money Bitfloor owes me with no real expectation it will come (I am hopeful).  CampBX has been great to me,  they solved the slowness issue fairly well and with decent swiftness.   To know it is a 1-2 person show makes it a pretty impressive operation. 
Co- office situations are pretty common in the world of business - especially for smaller operations.    Sorry OP has difficulty with bluster in the business world, it can be traumatic and cause for disillusionment  but I've been in it long enough to know that perception matters much more than almost anything else.  I'd call the Regus rental smart marketing.  
Keep trying.  You'll be fine.   These are honest people.

Pitch perfect what I thought, that and admitting to being a day trader.  That's a hobby, not a profession.
