Of course they are 100&amp; backed. This is how it works:
1) Put 10 million USD in the bank.
2) Issue 10 million Tether.
3) Buy BTC with the Tether you issued.
4) Sell BTC for 10 million USD.
5) Go to 1.

So, are you suggesting a merchant should contact other well established nodes and ask them for opening channels towards his node?
Isnt there a way to send btc over the lightning network and receive them back on-chain and then create new channels and iterate till you have a well connected node? 
It would be nice, if there was a service like that.
