Think the probability that tether has full reserves is higher than most think. It would be very natural for them to keep a low profile regarding where they keep the reserves. The bank holding the cash is probably unaware of what they are used for. After what happened with finex corresponding banks before they would be very carefull about keeping a low profile with banks now to avoid beeing cut off again just for being involved in bitcoin.

Yes, two months ago! How do this work? One would think that they already have had time to get the info and that if something was wrong, bitfinex would have been raided. If everything was in order-business as usual like now!?

Would be interesting to know know the spread they will apply and who the market maker is. Normally "no commission" means huge spread... Which is less transparent, always prefer upfront fee with low spread

I had trouble depositing USD ( I am European) due to the corresponding bank needing AMA/KYC to let the money through. Got the money into the account today but with several days delay. Have not had this problem before. Kraken support was helpful but could not do much until the corresponding bank let the wire through. It was a higher amount than usual but seems like US banks are becoming more aggressive.

In a regulated market, he would have sold and not told anyone else -that's the way the equities market work. He would have made money if true but price discovery would take longer. The reason why Charlie Lee might have affected the market on the margin is that he has creditability if he scammed, the market will not listen to him the next time(no matter the subject). Best to let the market handle creditability and price discovery rather than regulators. Regulations impose an enormous cost on market/society and can´t touch insiders anyhow. It´s like the war on drugs, the problem can´t be regulated away and only gets worse with regulation.
