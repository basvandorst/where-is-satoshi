These emails from that Robocoin CEO sound EXACTLY like josh garza...

really sorry op that you had to deal with all this crap, i really hope you didn't needed that money badly to pay for rent/food etc.
 fk robocoin
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:56:43
you can also tip 10 cents worth of bitcoin so thats not a argument at all.
Litecon, Vertcoin all these subreddits keep tiping alot and yes, you could call that real money too - because if you want, you can just exchange all of them into $,€ or whatever.
Thanks for taking so much time to answer my question!
And just for example, i woulda tiped you just right now if i would had bitcoins.
In most cases its not about the value of the tiping, its about sending a "thank you" to the opponent
@_date: 2014-10-18 23:00:36

yea keep following me mr. stalker
1/10 = 1% ?! ..guess you guys have no universitys at your home town.
And about Bitcoins future growth potential: 
I wasn´t talking about that altcoins lowered the growth potential, i said that alot of money went away from bitcoin and got invested in altcoins.. and as you said thats nearly 1/10 of bitcoins marketcap - so whats wrong ?!
 I said that there will be not such a big hype again as it was last year when everyone started covering bitcoin on their tv shows.
You think posting an article about reserve currencys from wikipedia.shit makes you look smart? 
He was talking about "important fiat currencys" and in this case, The dollar is indeed not important at all if you think about it. 
"A reserve currency (or anchor currency) is a currency that is held in significant quantities by governments and institutions "
So ofc there´s a shit load of Dollar, the US prints it like crazy with their QE´s.. 
now i´m done with ya.. go rest in peace mr. stalker

but having over 350k USD in it just doesnt make sense for a private investor in my opinion.
Cash some of them out and enjoy your life.

I´m here since 2 years and recieved like 4 tips so far. And all of them in the 1 figure cent range, it´s a joke.
Tipping is really not a big deal here and it´s really sad.
Happy to see that some people actually see that tiping as itself has great potential to spread the word and get new users attached to bitcoin.

Don´t understand what you mean? You even wrote it yourself.
""If you choose not to verify to Tier 3 and submit an ID selfie, we can refund your deposit back to the sending bank.""
Not too hard to understand, so not sure why you´re sceptic
And believe me, i have better shit to do then bitching online about a BTC Exchange..
They didn´t wanted to give me chargeback on my deposit when i said i don´t want to verify for tier 3 without sending them a id selfie. So i did that + verified for tier 3. And still my deposit is getting kept on hold and kraken.com refuses to give me a chargeback on my deposit or let me use my deposit for purchasing bitcoins.
Is that clearer to understand for you?

I don´t know the whole situation but people, **please calm down**
You can´t just tell him to kill himself and all this sort of stuff!
 That´s the wrong way and also fires up a dark light over the whole Bitcoin/Crypto Community.
So please, take a deep breath and relax for a second because no matter what OP did to you, he clearly doesn´t deserve to be threaded like this and **never ever** wish someone on the Internet dead/cancer
 or tell him to hang/kill himself.
Because **you never know in what bad shape the guy on the other side of the screen might allready be**
Do you want to be responsible for someone else suicide? i hope not.
Please stay focused and calm

@_date: 2014-12-06 08:55:38
Ok so first of all.
You do realize that High BTC Payouts with Zenpool can not get payed out to infinity as difficuilty
 keeps rising right?!
That´s the struggle everyone has to go through if you´re mining cryptos, 
not to mention Zenpoll is still the most profitable pool in the world.
Second one is, that prime Hashlet that you coulda bought for 16.95$ is now worth over 50$ 
on the market, and it could be 70$-90$ if you upgrade them which you can do FOR FREE.
Noone is forcing anyone to mine Hashpoints and to get on the PayCoin train. 
You can just sell your miners and you would still get your investment back and most likely more then that.
Third is if you bought too many Hashstakers after their release just to be one 
of the first ones to get a Top 300 Legendary, that´s your own fault.
Anyways if you don´t like them, you can get a full refund for them as Josh mentioned
 a few times allready after their release.

It was written in english, that´s a original Quote from the Support ticket replay.
They refused to give me a chargeback or give me access to my deposit through their exchange when i refused to verify myself for tier 3 without giving them my id selfie.
I did that in the meantime, verified for tier 3 incl. ID Selfie and they still  refuse to give me a chargeback or to allow me access to my deposit via their exchange.
Could be that i did understand it wrong, but either way. They don´t grant me access or chargeback with id selfie and tier 3 or without, doesn´t matter.
You guys focus too much on this missunderstanding as you call it so.
 It´s not about private data, it´s about them holding  money  back which is not their property and they do not have the right to do so, it´s illegal.
Let me explain it in a easier way how Kraken.com is working with their Money: 
Let´s say i own Amazon.com, and i want to buy Youtube.com for let´s say 400€.. but i do not have these 400€ for this type of investment.
So Customer 1 wants to buy a playstation from me for exactly 400€
He deposits the Money and will wait atleast 5 days before starting complaining right. 
so in the meanwhile i own 400€, which is not my money!
So i give those 400€ to Youtube.com to buy the Company instead of giving customer 1 his deposit and in the Meanwhile Customer 2 shows up, 
and wants to buy a Xbox one from me, for the same amount - 400€
So i take the money from Customer 2 ( 400€ ) buy a playstation from sony and first deliever it to Customer 1, because he is waiting since 5 days for this right? Then Customer 3 comes in and wants to buy a Wii U for 400€.. he deposits the money and is in "queue" So i take the Money from Customer 3 to pay Customer 2...and so on and so on...
Got it?
This way they get access to HUGE Amounts of Money which they can Invest, Speculate with but which is NOT THEIRS! this is Illegal!
@_date: 2014-12-12 09:37:39
For me 200k would be actually this. if your´re smart you don´t need more then that to.

All this Bullshit about your Company beeing new, having some technical problems here and there.. Who gives a shit? You have a product that you want me to buy - fine, i´ll give you money and you give me the product. 
Where you get the product from or what thoothbrush you use in the Morning i simply don´t give a fuck.
just give them their money back and a little extra so these young boys can move along.. No Matter whos responsible for all this, just do it.. or your reputation is ass and will be maybe forever.
If i was them, i woulda jumped in the car after a max. waiting time of 4 Weeks, drove to your House, and beat the shit out of you. Not joking...like, 25 gran...

MY LITTLE PONY SUB??? WAT?
@_date: 2014-12-06 12:54:38
the difficulty decreased by .7x% for the first time since like 25 months..
Mining reward payouts in generel have nothing to do with the price of Bitcoin.
I don´t think you got all that "higher diff = lower payout if your mh/gh stays the same" thingy did you?!
 click on performance, 
it´s not just one pool has decreased payouts over time, no..
it´s everyone due to rising difficulty. 
So why do you blame them?

A good reputation is pretty much EVERYTHING in the Bitcoin Community, when it 
comes down to Startups and smaller Companys.
A good reputation is everything, i repeat, **every-fucking-thing** you need
 to run a successfull Business Model like that.. 
But you guys just shoot yourselfes in da face.
Will not be suprised if a post comes up in a few months that Robocoin goes Bankcrupt. And then we will all gonna remember that it all started right here gentlemen.

was not even shipped yet and was still in delievery...lmfao

I only read your Topic cuz i just woke up..
I want to respond to the "Bitcoin can't be killed" part
Yesterday we had a News that CEX.IO is shutting down one of the biggest if not the biggest Cloud Mining Service due to BTC's low price.
So there you have it, if price &lt; costs = Bitcoin Network gets weaker and weaker cuz more and more miners will shut down their mining operations.
No more Halleluja Bitcoin Bullshit please.. Everyone who entered the game 2014
 is sitting on a horrible loss or sold / got scammed with a loss.
I am Pro Bitcoin, long and strong. But People keep forgetting that Bitcoin is actually killable.

Great quote, isn't this literally what all Cryptocurrencys are?
For me Bitcoin has no longterm value, it's the Blockchain technology behind it that holds some.
Doesn't mean you can't make money with Bitcoin if you're smart.. just don't think it will be a thing in 10+ Years.
Blockchain Technology will however.
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:52:55
Look i'm sure it will still be around but this is about the actual technology behind it.
Bitcoin doesn't hold any value other then people are pumping it up beeing the next gold and rarity/limiting factor. That is all.
You pay over 3000$ right now for something you can't even see or hold in your hands. 
If you fuck up and send it to the wrong adress by accident, the coins are lost forever. 
There's no consumer protection at all. No chargebacks or anything. This can be a good thing but in most cases is quite bad.
Wallet services go offline, some even scam or leave a Bitcoin mining software running without you even noticing it.
Exchanges scam, go bankrupt or get hacked.
Now Bitcoin got split, and suddenly Pools that were made with the idea of decentralization have direct influence on the outcome and could manipulate.
There's so many posts on weekly basis about people with big cash in btc  100k+$ getting stuck at exchanges, Accounts getting frozen without any support for months or people straight up getting scammed by exchanges and lose everything overnight.
For BTC to work longterm as a actual currency there HAS to be some sort of regulation and consumer protection, like it or not. 
I've been here for a few years now and seen all the ups and downs. Bitcoin isn't the "next big thing"..
It's the Blockchain.
Doesn't mean that you can't make money out of Bitcoin if you're smart.
@_date: 2018-10-29 10:15:31
The Question that actually scares me the most is that some entity out there owns 1/21~ or roughly 980000BTC of all Bitcoins that will ever exist and nobody knows who he/she/they are, aka Satoshi.
Imagine what potential damage this entity could do in the financial world with this huge ammount of BTC and there's nothing that could stop him and will only get worse the higher bitcoin rises.

The problem with you people is that you're in for making quick money while the rest of us old pals is in for the technology and a fundemantel change to paymentsystems for the first time in like 200 years.
I really miss this sub 3 years ago when people had good discussions about new protocols, adoption and talks about bitcoins future.
These days it feels like a bunch of 15 year olds throwing all their money at it for 2-3 months to make a quick buck and cash out. 
If yall would spent half the time trying to think forward how to help and grow bitcoin, adoption and this community as you spent on talking about price fluctuations then we'd all be chilling at the moon already.

Well food and stuff that you need to pay for life are still the same cost  but when it comes down to electronics, computerparts, smartphones and what not, we feel the difference allready and they are alot more expensive now then they used to be.
Just as a quick comparison, CPU's usually tend to get cheaper over time after their release, due to the weak euro an Intel i7 4790k was worth 278€ last years july, if you want to buy the very same cpu today you gotta pay 336€
and those prices are based on geizhals.de ( it searches you the cheapest retailer )
