Been like this for a few days, and i tried contacting their phone support today but troubleshooting isn’t available atm.
I’m just tryna move funds from coinbase to coinbase pro, all while the price slowly climbs while I wait

Yes, but that’s just because of supply and demand. Bitcoin is a good like gold: if people are buying it, prices rise.


I can kinda tell your not familiar with the concept of how blocks and mining work. Im not a great teacher so I won’t explain it myself, but I definitely recommend looking into that. Here are a few links that might be helpful:

I’m trying to transfer $150 worth of funds from coinbase to coinbase pro (“fast and free”).  They were added a few days back from my bank account so I guess they might be on hold. No clue where the 25 is from, probably part of an earlier transaction?
Idk I just found it funny that I have negative money available to deposit lmao

Yup, bout a week ago. No clue where the negative came from tho

That’s a fucking absurd amount of money

I used the other banks method actually. However, still planning to delete coinbase as soon as I find another good low fee exchange. Gemini maybe?

How do you buy instantly without getting hit with coinbase regular fees? I use both as well (and buy on coinbase pro weekly, and regular coinbase when there’s a large drop I don’t want to miss) but there’s no way to have coinbase pro’s lower fees if you buy instantly.

Cause I fucking work construction lmao I bought as much as I reasonably could between 6k-now, doesn’t mean I wouldn’t like to accumulate more

Thanks a ton, saving me money on the big dips ��

Sad that I get this

Those things are a lot harder to steal and a lot easier to insure than bitcoin. I agree that the members of this sub are a lil paranoid, but your analogy is totally off the mark.

The fact that “famously tweeted” is a totally sensible term blows my mind

It just keeps coming this shit is crazy. Wish I had more invested and wasn’t a casual lmao

As someone who followed this for a while and successfully stopped an orgasm many times during sex—it’s not worth it. Just jerk off earlier in the day and go hard af when it matters.

Definitely how I’m feeling rn. Got a few litecoin lying around and now I’m just waiting till the ratio goes back up to .013 to exchange it for bitcoin. Figure that’s a good move?
