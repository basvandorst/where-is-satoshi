Up until they stop being rewarded. Then what?
Because I can assure you, if your answer is "fees", Bitcoin will eventually be surpassed by any crytocurrency that doesn't require them.
Pools and large mining operations are a cancer that will eventually need to be treated, and the only way to do that is by going back to solo mining en-mass.
Satoshi was wrong.

People get it. The technical limitation needs to be dealt with. Not built around.
If there was no such limitation, everyone could mine at a low hash rate and create a safe and decentralised system. They would not pay any significant electricity or bandwidth bill above what they already do, and the storage space would be negligible with block pruning. That is the ideal scenario of bitcoin, and we should all be aiming for that.

0.0001 is a massive fee when talking about a global currency.
If you consider the world economy to be worth $4trillion, which is the most easily available figure, one of the 21m bitcoins has a theoretical value of $200k. If all future transactions require a $20 fee to be placed in a block, that is quite damning.
Edit: Yeah, so I had a brainfart and made a stupid assumption about this fee range staying consistent as time goes on. 0.0001 is still a huge transaction fee in the grand scheme of things.

A better option would be to stop centralisation of miners and instead lower the individual cost of mining by spreading the hash rate across hundreds of millions of bitcoin users. That way, everyone is incentivised to maintain the value of their own money without having to be taxed to use it. It is way more in-line with the decentralised backbone of bitcoin.

Levelling the playing field of cryptos doesn't involve just letting it happen. The more you sit around, the more businesses get involved in centralising bitcoin through large mining operations.
If you want bitcoin to really fix a disparity in wealth, you need to get the little people mining again. You need to get people back into the mindset of mining for the good of the ecosystem. All we have right now is a bunch of greedy businesses looking to make money off mining rewards. If anyone ever asks "is it worth mining?", the answer they get is unanimously, "NO!", because mining is seen as nothing more than a way to make money. It is the most damaging thing for bitcoin.

The current roadmap and potential roads to list on it are all weak.
SegWit is a bandaid, Lightning Network is a bandaid, blocksize increase is a bandaid, and even the "BlockTorrent" concept is only a means to speed up data propagation. None of these solve the underlying issue of the blockchain being unable to handle global transaction volume.
The only thing on the roadmap right now should be to focus on tearing apart the bitcoin architecture, by whatever means necessary, to increase transaction throughput at the base level. That does not mean increasing blocksize, because increased blocksize makes it increasingly more difficult to propagate transactions with the currently weak worldwide internet architecture and availability of said architecture.
Bitcoin's raison d'etre is DECENTRALISED SECURITY. The Bitcoin network is *nothing* without a decentralised userbase to verify validity. If Bitcoin is, and cannot easily be run by all of its users, then it cannot ever hope to be what it set out to be.

I completely agree.
There needs to be more talk about the greed of miners to be honest. It's gotten to the point where ASIC mining is no longer beneficial to the growth of bitcoin (if it ever was). Miners are literally just banksters right now, looking to make money out of money, without doing any real work. Among other terrible things, they push up the difficulty factor to the point where little people may as well not even bother mining out of good will, because they will never solve a block.
It's one thing to mine your fair share of bitcoin before worldwide adoption drives other currencies into the dirt, but taking more than that is just immoral.
People constantly talk about business miners as if they're the most valuable thing we have, but they're really not. There should never be a point where people looking to get into mining are told, "it's not worth mining". It directly contradicts what we're all trying to achieve here with a currency network built on the security of decentralisation.
So fuck you, business miners. You may have support right now, but as people wake up, you're going to be as hated as the banks people are desperately trying to get away from.

Given that inflation is purely an attempt to cover up debt that can never be paid off, the true future value of bitcoin will be nowhere close to the total USD in circulation. Once the tipping point is reached and confidence in the USD tanks, trading between BTC and USD will practically cease. The debt-based inflationary money still in circulation will effectively vanish. It will never convert into bitcoin value. Those who don't have bitcoin prior to USD tanking will bear the weight of the world debt.
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:00:31
Sorry for the slow reply, but I don't think it's possible to know. If it were so predictable, it'd already be happening. Such a change would purely be down to enough people losing confidence in fiat and starting a chain reaction.
You have to realise that bitcoin is a response to an absolute disaster that's been waiting to happen, and has been postponed for as long as possible. Whether a central bank declares itself bankrupt, or enough people wake up to the fact that central banks are already bankrupt, when enough people no longer believe in the value of their currency, its value will tank, while bitcoin's will surge. Eventually, when more people realise they're on a sinking ship, their money will already be effectively worthless, and they won't be able to find anyone willing to trade bitcoin for their pieces of paper. And of course, when the value of bitcoin soars, and other countries understand why, they will also scramble aboard, just like what we're seeing right now with China.
Ultimately, the more people that know about bitcoin, and know just how bad the global financial issues are right now, is what determines just when the change will happen.

Surely if the entire world were to adopt bitcoin as a primary currency, the value of a single satoshi would skyrocket. If the world economy (m0) is worth somewhere in the region of $4trillion, each of the 21 million total bitcoins should have a theoretical value of $190k. At that point, transactions today will make transactions in the future look like a billionaires club. Madness is the fact that you trivialise people spending $200 or more in future value on a coffee right now.
@_date: 2016-02-26 08:09:21
If you bought your bitcoin, you paid whatever you did because you thought it was worth that much.
In the future, the vast majority of people may not think your bitcoin is worth half of what you paid, so you will have lost money. On the other hand, it might be worth a lot to them. You cannot know these things.
Alternatively, if you bought an apple for $1 today, and tomorrow the demand for apples increases, you could sell your apple for more than you paid because people are willing to outbid eachother in order to get your apple. Conversely, people could not like apples anymore and not think your apple is worth anything.
@_date: 2016-02-26 03:11:37
Except it's not a middle-man, but middle-men. And none of them have any relationship to one-another. They all attempt to verify the same transactions, and they all cross-reference the validity of them. It is entirely different to the off-chain LN, where you can only obtain truly decentralised trust by pushing it back onto the overloaded blockchain.
The lightning network is a bandaid to a critical flaw in bitcoin. You cannot have capacity and the safety of decentralisation. Bitcoin is failing to achieve anything other than to re-invent the dollar. Or rather, create an even more complex dollar.
And don't misunderstand - I think Bitcoin and LN are very clever, and there are great minds behind them. But at this point, they're making sacrifices to ideology in order to prevent the whole system from failing. The current architecture is not up to the task it was set out to do.

As someone with experience at McDonalds, it really comes down to training. Most places don't accept them because they honestly have no idea how to recognise a fake note, whether it be £5 or £50. They simply don't want employees to be handing out large volumes of genuine cash in exchange for fake notes. At the lower end, the loss is minimal, but a loss of close to £50 is massive.
I'd say, if anything, they need to push out more £50 notes so that consumers can get used to handling them. After all, I think most people would be able to recognise if they'd been given a dodgy £20 note because they've seen a lot of them. With £50, they'd have no clue. Some people have probably never seen one at all.
From my own experience, they are used primarily by travellers of all distinctions.
@_date: 2016-02-26 03:29:48
You have to push your LN usage to the blockchain in order to verify that any of it is even remotely accurate. But the blockchain cannot handle that. Not because blocks are too small, or that blocks are too big, but because the process of decentralisation is too complex and too time-consuming with the infrastructure available to the millions of unique entities who safeguard the system.
Lightning Network is a means to keep this burning train hurtling down the tracks. It's clever, and I appreciate the effort gone into theorizing it, but it's a bandaid... and it might not solve anything.

I think you'll find that bitcoin is actually the blue pill. Most of what bitcoin does can be achieved in the real world if we just dealt with bad actors (government, middle-men, thieves, etc) and went back to trading intrinsic value.
While bitcoin is great for allowing worldwide financial transfers with ease, it's ultimately very similar to nerds being forced off the playground by the jocks, and taking up refuge in the library instead. Everyone should really just focus on creating a good environment on the playground instead of acknowledging the power of the bad actors.

It's harmful in that it minimizes decentralisation. Instead of a few thousand people crunching numbers in the background for zero investment and minimal electrical cost, a single entity is centralising the process.
Similarly, instead of a few thousand people voting on software changes, a single entity is making it extraordinarily difficult for them to have a say because they have created a pay wall for entry and continued presence.

Block size isn't a valid discussion. The infrastructure available to everyday spenders is not cheap or efficient enough to run a decentralised system with the high network volume of larger blocks.
Fundamentally, bitcoin needs to change the process of decentralisation to enable low-bandwidth transaction propagation. Without doing so, you have to centralise, and that makes the whole operation a complete waste of time as opposed to just investing in physical goods with intrinsic value.

They have a say in fees, which ultimately control the entire system under a limited block size.
Even with an unlimited block capacity, the idea that people are looking to, and are profiting from controlling a decentralised system is very unsettling to me. Instead of moving away from a system where third-parties profit from money transfers, we're just changing the manner in which the transfer fees are acquired.

@_date: 2016-02-26 12:56:27
You have to realise that in the long-term, changing block size is just delaying the inevitable.
Trust me, I want millions of miners mining from home, subsidizing the electricity cost of the network evenly across the whole userbase, but you have to understand that increasing the block size will make it impossible to propagate larger blocks around the network when not everyone has high-speed internet and unlimited data allowance. Some places simply don't have that infrastructure, and some that do charge a lot of money for it. The current block size is already problematic for individuals with lacklustre internet, and doubling it only stands to make that worse. To handle the kind of traffic volume that existing payment systems handle, the block size would have to be completely out-of-reach of the ordinary person. Doing so will make fees absolutely essential, as someone has to pay to do the work you can't.
What we need are intelligent coders to come forward and either make the transmission of data more bandwidth efficient, or to completely overhaul how the blockchain works, maybe even scrapping it in favour of a system that can handle worldwide traffic.

Core has planned to HF for a long time, but they preferred to release SW first and then rewrite it into a fully-integrated HF update at a later date when it is proven and the infrastructure is there for much larger block support. Because SW essentially raises the block size to 2MB, upping it to actually be 2MB will make blocks ~4MB.

I think you'll find that you can. Social ostracism is a very powerful tool.
Let me give you an example that explores a real-world scenario that the blockchain already deals with:
If you see someone robbing a store, what can you do? Ignore it, or step in to deal with the thief? Bitcoin handles bad-actors by using consensus among honest users. Because the honest users want to maintain the overall health of the network, they prove that an attempt to transfer someone else's funds is not right. In the real world, a person might step in to stop a theft because they know it is harmful to the store, and harmful to their community as a whole. Nothing is done to that person on the blockchain, but in real-life, there are consequences for causing harm, incentivizing people to play nice.
Competing with other miners via hashing power is harmful to decentralisation - the foundation and absolute most important part of the bitcoin network. There needs to be equal social consequences for doing so as there are to people causing damage to society as a whole.
@_date: 2016-02-20 12:05:17

They sought to create their own society without the restrictions imposed upon them by their rulers. It's not too dissimilar from trying to escape a hostage situation. You are not in the wrong for attempting to secure your freedom, but having the means to do so can be difficult and requires organisation.
Encryption is almost comparable to the ocean that prevented the consensus rules of Britain from being enforced in the US. The difficulty of persecuting those who dared defy rule, using the ocean and consensus to their advantage, led to them getting their freedom.
Eventually, though, the ocean becomes problematic for things such as trade, and comparably to bitcoin, the cost of using encryption on such a large scale is prohibitive too. So while bitcoin may succeed in giving us all a way to subvert our rulers, eventually it would just be more convenient to not use bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2016-02-26 12:40:08
Which is why there should really be some kind of social stigma or in-built punishment for doing so. The centralisation of mining power is a huge issue that needs to be talked about.
If you were handing out free pens and someone was taking more than their fair share, causing other people to lose out, you would step up and tell them they were being greedy. They would be shamed and you would maybe even ask them to leave. Bitcoin doesn't do that. But Bitcoin really needs to do that. It is essential.

Duh, because it's not really a scaling solution, but a bandaid on top of another bandaid.
Bitcoin was touted as a decentralised, zero-trust, digital currency with no fees. You cannot tell me this has not how bitcoin has generally been sold up until now. LN is only one of those - digital currency. By disconnecting from the blockchain, you are requiring trust, you are centralising payments, and you will be creating fees by routing payments through the same middle-men bitcoin was trying to escape from in the first place.
Please, tell me how the future of bitcoin, as envisioned right now, is even remotely close to the original vision.

@_date: 2016-02-22 09:42:28
Just invest in bitcoin instead. It really isn't worth mining right now. Maybe in the future when bitcoin stops being about climbing over your competitors for the coinbase reward and starts truly being a payment system, you could get into mining for fun. Right now, unless you're on the forefront of ASIC advancements and have a lot of money to blow on electricity, it's just not worth the gamble.
Eventually we're either going to see miners desperately trying to earn money from transfer fees, or the difficulty dropped through the floor so millions of users can CPU mine on their PCs and phones.
@_date: 2016-02-25 00:45:02
Ultimately, as far as I'm aware, all cryptos will suffer from the same fate of being unable to handle millions of transactions at the blockchain level. There is a very real possibility that we'll all have to use multiple altcoins just to get around that issue, but it's not a good solution because it emphasizes the weakness in the blockchain technology at the base level.
There is hashing power required and present for every altcoin, and ability to transact there without the need of mining fees. This is most definitely an opportunity for each altcoin to grow in economic value, but should that have to occur in the first place? If that hashing power is present across multiple cryptos, there should be a means of pooling it all together to create liquidity on a single currency network without centralising it under small mining groups. After all, altcoins are a form of decentralisation, and that shows us that there is the possibility to solve our liquidity and transaction-limit problem by decentralising miners. The issue is making it happen on a single network from the ground up.

If the cost of hashing goes down, hashing will go up. Then difficulty will go up too. 
I'm struggling to see how bitcoin can survive without going back to low-hash CPU mining en-mass and having the userbase foot the electricity bill evenly. If there are security issues with that, then bitcoin is dead in the water. We can't keep throwing money at this thing forever, and excessive taxes are going to really disadvantage the currency when compared with the reliable old precious metals.
@_date: 2016-02-24 05:23:17
Basically this.
I don't want to pay fees to some company whose only desire is to make a profit on transfers. That's exactly the kind of thing a lot of users are trying to escape from. If that means I have to run a miner for a full 60 minutes at a reasonable hash rate alongside making a transaction, then so be it. I don't want my funds to be locked away behind a feewall because some big mining corporations are pushing up the hashrate and locking out the little people. That is the kind of fucked up shit that will kill bitcoin.
If the options were 100million users doing 50-100h/s at all times versus paying fees to unlock my funds, and the former couldn't happen for whatever reason, I'd rather not use bitcoin at all.

I agree with what this guy says. The mentality shift bitcoin has seen is dangerous. "incentivized people to be corrupt".
The only reason I'm even bringing this up is because I think we seriously need to discuss the matter of decentralisation because it's core to what made bitcoin what it is. Unfortunately, decentralisation alone won't solve the limitations of the blockchain.
Right now, I honestly think coins running on Cryptonote will be far more successful than Bitcoin in the long run, because they help to force an even playing field. There are already systems in place to easily mine and smart-mine between them, allowing everyday users to maintain 8+ networks without any input with just a single CPU core. Every coin on Cryptonote could easily share the same pooled value and be swapped with one another to get around block size limitations on one of the networks. It's not clean, but it's better than what Bitcoin offers at the moment. Way better.

Because currency is directly related to what you can purchase with it.
If $1 buys you an apple, $1 worth of BTC will also buy you an apple. Whether $1 of BTC is 36,000 whole coins or 0.00000100 satoshi, if that's what the value of an apple is perceived as, that's what you will use.
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:34:58
I'm not going to disagree that perceived value exists, but the ultimate factor for a currency to be valuable, is being able to exchange it for goods and services that are valuable to you. The value of bitcoin is thus equal to the good or service you use it for.
The more people buy little things with bitcoin, the more widespread support for taking payment in bitcoin becomes. As small sales pick up, retail confidence does too. Bigger ticket items start being commonly sold for bitcoin, and then bigger still, until eventually you're at the point where supply of coin is lower than what is being demanded, and the value of smaller denominations begin to be perceived as more valuable.

If any disaster was to occur and the internet suffered heavily, low-speed mesh networks would be the only thing capable of maintaining the bitcoin network. If we scale bitcoin to be so heavy that a mesh network wouldn't be good enough to maintain it, bitcoin would completely collapse.

1 node can service millions of users. The best node. 100% trustworthy - you can trust me! 50GB blocks! Dude, it must be so safe. If we all support the centralization, it becomes c o m p l e t e l y decentralized.

Any non-segwit blocks are ignored by UASF nodes. Nodes that accept current blocks will continue chaining segwit and current blocks together because segwit blocks can function as current blocks, while UASF nodes will only chain segwit blocks.
Because new blocks rely on the validity of the previous block when chaining them together, this results in 2 different chains existing simultaneously - a chain where both current+segwit blocks are deemed valid, and a chain where only segwit blocks are deemed valid.
But there's a caveat in that seemingly nobody wants to continue chaining current+segwit blocks, which is where "bitcoin cash" comes in.
So there are 3 potential chains after this point:
* No change chain [this will not be supported in any way]
* SegWit (UASF) soft-fork [it will function with the majority of existing node software and thus you don't need to do anything to be on this chain]
* "Bitcoin cash" fork [requires a new node client]

Or we could just double-up the existing bitcoin architecture with zero added coinage instead of adding in a completely different coin with different valuation, different PoW and additional coin supply.
The whole thing is ridiculous though because it neglects to address the additional computation and energy required to run a global currency twice. Bitcoin's power consumption alone will already be a massive issue in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:06:05
Just remember that the ultimate valuation of bitcoin is based off the losses of those who fail to invest in time. As bitcoin starts getting to the $100k range, no one will want dollars, and exchanging your bitcoins for them would be insane. Anyone without bitcoin at that point is SoL unless their employer was smart enough to convert in time.
If you're hoarding millions of dollars worth of future coin, you best be prepared to do the moral thing and help out those who will suffer severely from such a change. Don't criticize the existing millionaires for having gross amounts of money if you're going to do the same thing when placed in that situation.

In the real world, the one with the most utility and ease of use will take over entirely. In the bitcoin world, the same will happen.
Legacy chain might survive a while, but you have to be deluded to believe increasing block size is sustainable for a decentralized currency. The internet infrastructure in my area of the UK has not improved in at least 10 years. People in my position and worse could never keep up with the inevitable further block increases, and absolutely could not handle BU. Making it even more difficult for the average user to support the system will only benefit the existing centralized power structure that bitcoin was created to eliminate.

The only thing those against BIP148 have is FUD. They know that legacy chain will die from re-orgs if the new chain gets decent support, so all they can do is try to scare as many people out of mining on the segwit side as possible.
Whether they like it or not, it is too risky for them not to endorse BIP148.

The premise of your argument is incorrect. Bitcoin has value because people believe it can undermine the world banking system. It is only usable because they do, and because they power the sytem to achieve that goal. The moment they no longer believe it has a future as a currency that can replace big bank bucks, it's as dead as when it started. If it doesn't scale, that's what will happen.
The only people who view bitcoin as an asset are big bank-entangled governments.

For the untrained eye, people just want to know the software they're downloading is safe. Core, as a team, has a reputation that other coders do not. The whole team can disagree on the network effects a client poses, but if you really want to sit on the fence and be unbiased, you surely wouldn't want the reputation of bitcoin to be soured by some rogue group putting out node software with malicious code. Even if it has to be behind a paywall to ensure you all get paid for looking over it, it would be nice to get some assurance from a respected group over what software is safe to use.

Circumstantial evidence at best.
Yes, they could track that you bought some. Yes, they could track the coin ownership, assuming you didn't mix them, but how do they prove you own the private keys to the address they ended up on? You could quite easily have been spending them and no longer own any. How do they prove your guilt and how do you prove your innocence? It's impossible. Even a lie detector test is not absolute proof. They could try remote viewing, but if any remote viewer is good enough to find your seed or whatever, then bitcoin is dead - doesn't even require quantum computing, because anyone can theoretically remote view.

The biggest issue that will forever plague bitcoin is that no one wants to/will mine from home because it's expensive and requires an education in itself. Bitcoin was set up to be decentralized and run by everyone to ensure consensus rules were in effect, but the hash rate required to be of any use to the network is so high that it's simply not worth your time, even just to police the code. Thus, it will inevitably become centralized unless we get plug-and-play mining units that require no technical knowledge, and somehow become far more energy-efficient or utilize solar.
The next most likely issue to kill bitcoin is fiat failing and taking down the electrical grid and internet during the period of mass confusion over who is paying for those services and how they're being paid. Alternatively, the internet could be crippled by an attack on the cables across the sea floor and elsewhere. A combined effort to disconnect isolated countries from the internet wouldn't be out of the question.
These are frankly the least talked about points of failure somehow.

The only reason Bitcoin has value at this point is due to speculation of future value. If Bitcoin is guaranteed to remain stagnant, it will lose significant value and perhaps become obselete - not be digital gold. There are way better means of storing value to the average person than complex code they will never be able to comprehend beyond "this stuff lets me buy things?".
