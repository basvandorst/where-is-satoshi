Right now decent ASIC miners are starting to reach the 5 digit price range.   Who has 10k to risk on a KNC Neptune to stay competitive in mining services?

The pile of Java vulns which allows malware to escape its VM that seem to be a mainstay of exploit kits.  
       
I know, not exactly the same (Java VM vs x86 emulation) but VM and sandbox escapes do occur.

Some non technical considerations:   
How many 500+ years old currencies are still in use?   
How have the few 500+ year old currencies still in use changed over time?   
How many 500+ year old currencies (not made of precious metals) have any usable value today outside of collectors' curiosity?

TIL: engaging in rhetoric means you're crazy.   
    
If throwaway-o exceeds your thresholds, you may want to avoid watching or listening to the proceedings of the eu parliament or reading any Winston Churchill quotes.  The nasty, bullying rhetoric and stealthy conversational jabs would cause high anxiety and the onset of the vapors.

As mining becomes unprofitable for everyone except those who can build datacenters and eat losses for a while (Eg, banks), this is how bitcoin would be regulated.   
      
"Sorry, your BoA Bwallet^TM can not accept funds from unregistered wallets.  The transaction has been rejected by the mining department." (and all the other large financial miners as well)
     
Yes you can work outside the system, but it would be like the current Facebook use problem.

If you have a tax problem work with an accountant to figure out how much you should be donating to charities.   
     
(US centric) Suggestions for privacy and avoiding restrictions on technology:  
-EFF  
-EPIC  
-ACLU  
     
Donations to troll power consolidators (some tax deductible, some not):  
-Wikileaks  
-Firearms Policy Coalition  
-Pirate Party  
     
Get yourself a house, insulate the shit out of it and put solar on the roof so you can mine the sun while you mine coins (or just be more power self sufficient).  I think there are tax advantages to home improvements above a certain dollar amount.

This was aired out during the late '12 closed door ITU "let's censor and spy on the internet" meeting.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a link to the then posted logical system diagram this evening.  From my memory the diagram had backbone devices with databases hanging off of them and individual packets had auth info attached to them. The devices would block stuff which didn't auth.  My thoughts were "huh, this looks like performance ignoring pie in the sky wishing".

Which is a shame since printers are a great resource for attackers to compromise.  Ever since clever college students coopting the i960 print job rendering processors with custom postscript "print jobs" to number crunch because it was more powerful then their own workstations, printer misuse has been largely ignored.

If you could be (technologically) banned from the internet then bitcoins would be much harder to use.   Disturbingly enough, the ITU is working on implementing this capability.

Reality4you is a troll, but here he's got a point.  Less/no regulation means more research is necessary.   Look at how wallstreet solves (and fails to solve) these sorts of problems and make that into a service.  
     
Even with the piles of .gov red tape, Burnie Madoffs still happen and investors are left with a fraction or nothing.

One of the more interesting bitcoin popularity effects is the "(re?)discovery" of security for many users.   Application security auditing and penetration testing are fairly mature services and the top vendors (and high profile people they employ) are known.  
     
Here on reddit there are good places to go for knowledge (for starters).
