I had 6 bitcoins at one point.  Forgot all about it.  Company went under.  It does kind of suck.
I tried to get them back last year.  What can you do

I am kind of a newb to bitcoin but have used it. 
I thought the system was supposed to protect itself.  For example, with the US dollar, there is the possibility of manipulation from governments or private banks or what have you.    I thought bitcoin was immune from that because, it was more difficult to track down the bitcoins.
Now, we are saying the process is flawed?   Well, it wouldn't make much use to then get the US government involved, you might as well use the dollar.

I wonder what that OReilly book is

Then what is the author talking about, where are the security issues?

In the US, aren't most debit cards/credit cards tied to a social security number.  Even prepaid cards? How will they remain anonymous.

Linode is THE host if you want affordable virtual hosting.  If a couple of systems were comprised, they probably have tens of thousands of sites.  They probably didn't want to cause great panic.  If a couple of sites were comprised, maybe that isn't a time to send to the entire linode community.

ELI5:  So, does that mean they could have hacked those accounts?  Easily?  Why didn't they?
I was also curious, if you have a large wallet, wouldn't you want to unload it pretty fast.  You shouldn't treat it as a bank account?
Another thought.  I never really understood the bitcoin mining but instead of mining, couldn't you just bitcoin steal?  Because of the anonymity of the system, isn't stealing free game?  If you can find a large wallet/address why NOT steal from it, use it?  
It is almost like, you can live any random spot in the Universe but you can't have any locks on your doors, there is NO security.  So if you get robbed, there is nothing that can be done.  The robbers have free reign if they find you.

Couldn't this be done through http wallet pages?
Why the need for the bitcoin scheme?

What is a bitcoin client.  I just bought some bitcoins, added them via instawallet.
What does a client do?

Let's say this is not a Fox hit piece. I saw this article.

Not for me, I still can't get over the transfer of said products.
I don't trust our current couriers.

Why?  Once you start associating your person with the bitcoin transactions then the government has control over those transactions.  They might start to wonder where they came from?  What was the purchase for?  If you are selling drugs through bitcoin transactions, maybe we need to get the DEA involved.
If you want to give back to the government, that is on you but I don't see a need to do it through bitcoin.

I was searching bitcoin and taxes.  I was hoping that the community was absolutely against the idea of taxing bitcoin transactions.  Why?  Because once you start associating bitcoin transactions with organizations then it defeats the purpose.
Anyway, it seems to me that the technology is designed to operate without government tracking bitcoin transactions.    As long bitcoins operates in a way that it can't be shutdown, then it can't be outlawed.
... 
Also, is there any valid reason to tax bitcoin transactions?  Once you register a bitcoin purchase/transaction with the government, you have already kind of defeated the purpose of the anonymous, decentralized, cyrpto secure nature of the system.  
I am not getting user's want to start taxing.

I think you would have to detect it first.  
It seems to me that beauty of bitcoin is that it exists but doesn't exist.

That is where the human element comes into play.   If he has a bad lawyer, couldn't he just answer truthfully, "where are all of you bitcoins?"
@_date: 2013-08-15 05:10:42
Because bitcoin is decentralized, is it possible that bitcoin usage is protected?  For example, bitcoin operations can continue because the government can't stop those services that are running?
The client and the server are protected?

That is not the sole purpose, tax evasion.  But I think you lose a lot of those items you listed when the government(s) gets involved.  You probably have to identify yourself with your transactions.  Then the government will get involved in what the transactions are for.
It seems like the creator of bitcoin designed the system so that large entities (like government) can't get involved in how bitcoin operates.  Once you throw in taxes, they are immediately involved and will start to control how things work.

From my brief use of bitcoin, 
You have to have a location for your bitcoins?  E.g. like a text file, note file.
How would he keep track of all of those wallets?
