"remember what Mike said publicly?" What did he mean?

His actions were immoral. Trust me, I am going to alert the authorities.

Andreas is smart person but some of those names are poison to the Bitcoin community. Especially Peter Todd. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 11:44:39
Someone please report Peter Todd to the law.
@_date: 2016-01-11 03:45:47
How is this practical if it takes many attempts? You lose money each time.
@_date: 2016-01-11 23:55:38
I will be informing the law about his posts. The guy needs to stop acting like a child.
@_date: 2016-01-12 00:31:48
I will word it in a manner that will help them understand.
@_date: 2016-01-15 00:51:01
Thank you!

The majority believe that the world is round. A minority don't.

To call it the decentralist perspective is a misnomer. Other decentralists believe that small blocks will harm decentralisation.

There is less need for the LN is transactions are already happening on the Blockchain.
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:23:49
You tell me how it can succeed if there were big enough blocks.
Smaller blocks means transactions forced away from blockchain. More money for Blockstream guys.
@_date: 2015-09-04 18:41:05
Andreas is actually in favor of block size increases.

Payment channels are not what the financial institutions are looking at.
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:00:15
You misunderstood him. He is talking about payment channels, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-07 12:55:12
Why does Facebook need crypto? They just need a centralised database.
@_date: 2015-09-07 11:54:27
I have a lot of respect for Andreas. He is a very smart man, but this is one area where he is completely wrong.
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:49:33
Great post.

Adam Back is a troll.
@_date: 2015-09-11 18:44:05
You can't say things like this, it isn't professional. This isn't a school yard.

This reddit will survive. It will just change to allow more open discussions.
The real loser in all this is Theymos.

Greg Maxwell speaks too much.
@_date: 2015-10-30 15:31:46
He sure doesn't seem so humble on Twitter. I guess the Internet reveals the truth about people.
@_date: 2015-10-06 18:53:42
This time we don't have Mt Gox fabricating a bull run.
@_date: 2015-09-02 17:39:30
Great question.
@_date: 2015-10-02 21:21:25
Why is this not off-topic? All those other threads got removed?
