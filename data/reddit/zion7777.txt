Im more cautious when media gets the hype of showing how Bitcoin goes up vs the stocks plunding, just like how every bank will tell you theyr doing well when theyr not and every government tell you lies about economic growth when clearly ee see signs of hyper inflation and unemployment Every media is paid to deliver something. Anyway be safe and watchful guys

Looks like everything is staged properly... Banks were bullish and BTC went down with classical alibis of hacking... now BAKKT is back for september enticing us to be bullish and what do you know can happen.. we might be playing along with their games ladies and gentlemen..
