I still can't witdraw my bitcoins at Bittrex. I asked the support when they are going to support new address but they are just ignoring my tickets.
Am I supposed to send my bitcoins to an old wallet or exchanges and then to my wallet? Im not willing to pay tax or multiple transactions fees I just want to witdraw my bitcoins which have been withhold for months!

Not the full truth. Native segwit addresses must be bech32 because the old ones cannot encode native segwit addresses. They are of course different things but are inherently tied together.

It still doesn't work. Segwit was 8 months ago... 5 months ago I made this post and today Bittrex is still not able to send the bitcoins to my wallet.

The Bittrex support after I wrote on the 5 months old ticket and told them I still can't **withdraw** my bitcoins:
"You will need to generate a BTC address by logging into your bittrex account, clicking "wallets" and the searching for BTC. Then next to BTC click the green circle and arrow. A box will appear where you are given the option to generate a address. Also a link below on how to withdraw your coins."
"I have generated a address for you BTC"
Even if you use the word **withdraw** in every single sentence they won't understand you.

After many months they finally sent me an answer to my ticket
"At this time we are not anticipating any changes to the BTC wallet format. We will continue to operate with Base58 addresses until otherwise stated. If Bittrex ever chooses to incorporate new address formats for any coins, we will make it know to our users in a public manner."
