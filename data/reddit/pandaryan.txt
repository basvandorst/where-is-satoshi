I’m stuck on BTC, ETH and DOGE. They work the best of all the coins I’ve used. BTC I’m still waiting for segwit and lightening network, but eth and doge are fast and simple with low fees.

Start with small transactions before going big. Very important lesson.

Asked a friend how to mine back in 2013, he sent me a few whole coins. Keys are definitely gone. Sigh. Next time.

Technology more than profits!
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:52:31
Good person you are!
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:08:45
Make sure to always send and confirm small amounts of money before sending amounts like 3,000 in a coin valued above .50¢
I hope this gets resolved for you. Freewallet was fine for me, but I’ve heard more good than bad.

I think of it as, the child is young and therefore ignorant (by nature), but since he paid money for his college already. It was a little poke joke about the child not knowing much (obviously) haha.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:29:51
Well holy shit. If you really did this with no fee then I'm ordering one of these yesterday! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:27:45
Oooooohhhhhh! This is really cool! I thought to myself, "If i were a bitcoin millionaire i'd custom order one as a holographic trading card with some stats that would be bitcoins current price, the year and increase since 2009!" Alas... I am not. So I can't. But I really appreciate this!

Hello fellow panda. Please remember to allow ample time for studies! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:41:58
i meannnnnn. You could transfer it out no?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:53
Depends on when you want to buy. I missed out on a large sum of money because of that damned wait time. Then again, I deposited cash instead of buying Bitcoin at the price it was at.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:53:50
Wait for the dip! If it ever happens.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:22:26
If you're certain you copied the address perfectly then just sit tight, it can be scary. 
NOTE: You're ledger should generate a new address after each transaction, I usually copy the most recent. HOWEVER. The previous generated ones are still valid so it wouldn't matter if you didn't use the newest one.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:33:00
And you can confirm no fees? Because some guy ordered a couple of beers that totaled 60$ with fees.
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:44:22
Can't that just be tracked back also?
@_date: 2019-06-21 06:15:41
Jesus. No they were legitimately disassociated for a brief moment and it caught me off guard. They corrected and are now back to following BTC. What’s your problem?
@_date: 2019-06-02 06:44:14
How would one do this on the ledger? I am trying to generate a QR code that I can use on a daily basis for personal use only.
@_date: 2019-06-17 06:06:32
WoW Gold.
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:21:48
Thank you!

Coinbase Commerce is free.

@_date: 2019-06-03 08:24:37
Thank you. I understand now.
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:21:05
Depositing from my phone to my cold storage is difficult without having the cold storage with me at all times to generate a new QR. I am considering making one of the generated QR codes into a permanent key to reuse easily.
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:40:41
Well I have thought about it. That’s why I’m asking here. Trying to gain insight I don’t have. My best guess is that it’s a push to 10,000 to try and gain more confidence, but if that’s true then it might come back down if it fails to hold or break.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:44:20
I've never heard this. This is so nice.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:46:12
You came off so aggressive though. Maybe you could've made an informative post to educate instead of insult.
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:19:47
So if the addresses were linked to a Trezor cold storage it would be even better than an online address correct?
Also, thank you!
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:57:01
Hah. Thanks for the chuckle. But yeah I guess so... haven’t found a better explanation yet.

Not the guys who mined millions before the early adopters had a handful?
@_date: 2019-06-02 05:22:04
Thank you, this helps!
@_date: 2019-06-02 06:43:37
I was just using trezor as an example. The person I am trying to help uses a ledger nano. Does the same process still apply / do you know how to create a master public key on their application / platform? I appreciate the help, you seem to know a lot about this.
I am trying to either have the character/ number string or (and) the QR code.
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:42:24
I just meant the general community idea that stands behind the technology and not the price. Also the general friendliness I’ve seen.
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:54:15
You’re calling the work that people have done on similar technology in order to try and create a better future, speculative noise and not worth looking into... that’s not the BTC spirit. I never tried to argue that BTC didn’t have value.
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:40:03
Hm. Interesting.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:45:04
First person to comment with something helpful. I appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:23:03
into bitcoin? 
1. You'd be an adopter of a global currency that has been thoroughly tested and proven to work throughout the years
2. You would be supporting its use
3. Its a technology that allows people financial freedom and for the most part, anonymity. 
4. Supporting a society who's financial foundation would be based on mathematics, technology, and science would be a step in the right direction towards a more educated future.
5. I can't speak for the financial gain part of it as much as i'm sure you would like to hear that... While yes, if its adoption becomes global and common, its price would soar and so too your life savings. But honestly, I would really encourage you to put it in simply because its a futuristic technology that would benefit billions, not because you you're gambling on it. 
Good luck!

Only if someone found the address correct? And even then unless someone knew me they wouldn't know who the address belongs to right? I don't honestly know the answers to these questions. Everyone stresses privacy, but there would still need to be further gathered information than just my wallet address.
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:45:19
.... well yes, okay. But beyond that the valuations were incredibly similar throughout the years and suddenly it does this? I guess that’s not suspicious for you.
@_date: 2019-06-03 08:20:20
I won't be spending from this address is the thing. Thats why I said deposits specifically.
