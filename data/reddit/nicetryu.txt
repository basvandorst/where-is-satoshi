Patience is learned.  Do you think it's a good idea to sell your stack at the bottom?  You think you can time the market, but what if you're wrong?  What if all you have to tell yourself that this might be the bottom was that feeling of having your nutsack/ovaries retreat so far into your body you can feel it in your throat?  That feeling of panic that causes cold sweats and a fight or flight response to your exchange where you decide you're willing to take a loss just to make that feeling stop.  If you've ever been over-invested in a volatile asset that's taken a dip, temporary or otherwise, you know this feeling.
Knowing yourself well enough to avoid making a short sighted decision based on fear is a skill.

Anyone who's ever invested a penny in anything has bought into an overpriced position.  Some people realize early and get out with little to no harm.  Others have the patience to see it through.  A few feel resentment and self loathing for having made a badly informed decision that cost them money.  Those few learn from their mistake by questioning why their entry price was unreasonable.  They question the asset.  If they realize that the asset was not at fault, that they were at fault, they come back.

As far as I have found, they do not batch anything.  I started noticing this inefficiency over the last few months while using Gdax alongside other exchanges that had implemented batching.  Inefficiency in block-chain usage from major exchanges is a known issue and I'm glad it's getting more attention from the community.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:05:41
Efficient transactions with almost unlimited outputs have been available in Bitcoin for a while and miners were the first groups to make use of them.   Some smaller exchanges followed because they have slimmer profit margins.  The largest exchanges make so much money that they can afford to waste some of it on transaction fees and pass the cost onto the network.  This seems like a standard Tragedy of the Commons scenario.  I'm not sure if this is intentional but it's become very clear that Coinbase, possibly because of it's early association with certain toxic investors, has a vested interest in harming Bitcoin in favor of other assets.  I try to recommend other exchanges when possible.

If there's only a small correlation between the security of the network and new transactions on the network, then the total cost of security should also be represented as having the same small correlation to the cost of new transactions on the network.

0-conf describes a transaction that has made it into the mempool (distributed across nodes) but hasn't been confirmed yet in a block. Each block inclusion is considered a confirmation. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash both suggest 6 confirmations for large critical transactions.  Most exchanges will give you access to funds after 2-3 confirmations.  
In the past some argued that 0-conf was fine for small, real world transactions like coffee or groceries but that tune has changed recently, mostly because neither bitcoin nor bitcoin cash currently have the bandwidth for mass adoption scale real world usage.
@_date: 2018-05-31 12:44:07


I wish this were even possible.  Nobody ever considers their entire energy footprint.
Mining costs don't just enable transactions, they enable the security of the entire system.  When merchants choose financial services, they typically pick the banks that offer the highest advertised security at the lowest cost to them. Most merchants have no considerations beyond that.  Any request for a bank's energy footprint would probably be considered a security incursion, so I wouldn't suggest trying it.


The average Bitcoin transaction value is $46,719 and the median is $483.03.  Try asking your bank for a $0.30 bank transfer and see how that goes.  10 minutes is the average time between blocks. The average electricity cost per transaction is about $0.75.

@_date: 2018-10-28 13:25:27
Ok, but you're making a case for "zero" utility so you're missing something.  The "real" price of Bitcoin is not near $0.00 and consistent average demand reflects a "utility" value that's much higher than a "real" price near $0.00 so your penny stock analogy doesn't quite work.  There's demand for Bitcoin as a stably priced asset that's currently restricted by block capacity.  That transactional demand is currently baked into the equilibrium price reflecting the utility of the asset, like you said, but that's changing with the growth of off-chain payment processors that are positioned to capture profit from transactional exchange and are doing a better job of negotiating fees and exchange rates than individuals with short time preferences.
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:24:52
I understood your meaning. Most of it was very clear. I'm just saying that penny stocks aren't a good comparison because they don't have same associated cost or the demand/liquidity.  There are no penny stocks trading an average of $3.5B in volume daily.
@_date: 2018-10-28 01:53:37
You're describing "equilibrium price" and not "final" or "zero" price.  It's also not just cost of production but also a pretty steady demand for bitcoin at $6400. If the demand was lower the price would have equalize lower along with the cost of production.

Not every definition of community implies ideological alignment.  Tools usually don't care why you want to use them.  The Bitcoin community is only aligned as much it derives value from Bitcoin.

You're right, short term buyers that get burnt usually have a hard time seeing the long-term potential of the network.  Those that do see the potential and utility of the network will continue buying above 12000.   The important thing is to avoid sellers remorse when you sell at 12000.  If you do buy back at 12500 or 16000 you're going to drive up demand and contribute to it's price inflation.

People keep expecting the price to shoot up the way it did in November and December within a week.   I don't think anyone should have delusions of 60-100% in a month right now.  The smart money comes in from people that see the long term value of the network in 2-20 years, when it's as mature as the Internet is now.  Anyone investing long term has been calculating a rate of acquisition based on how cheap/expensive they think the price is and buying or selling based on those calculations.
Short term money doesn't show up until later.

Subsidization doesn't bother me because reducing costs per client is how all  industries profit.  Nobody is going to build Netflix, study Medicine or develop an effective life saving drug just for you. You're already receiving the benefits of subsidization and would like to continue to receive those benefits.  You just want to exclude some segment of the population and reap what you perceive to be the benefits of their exclusion.  Defining a segment of the population as medically "uninsurable" is only a few short steps away from Eugenics. Your perceptions about the benefits of exclusion are probably as questionable as your arguments against subsidization.  In the case of Netflix, a very profitable private company disagrees with your conclusion.
Here's another example for you, some people think the subsidization of farmers is a waste of money.  Specifically, they believe small farms that haven't consolidated into more efficient operations should all be excluded from receiving government subsidies.  They believe tax breaks and handouts are hiding inefficiencies and slowing the pace of innovation.  That the subsidies currently in place are antiquated.  Do you agree or disagree?  I'm on the fence about this one.  Farmers are making a killing with the "organic" craze and farm to table operations.  Why do they need handouts?
Disclaimer: I don't subscribe to Netflix and think business should be able to maximize profits by choosing their customer base as long as they don't have monopolistic control over vital social services.
