Blockchain.info does not directly sell BTC, it uses coinify, however blockchain also verifies your identity, probably for coinify
So basically I’m asking the minimum age for coinify. I should’ve made that more clear. My bad

I think this guy must be a troll. I checked his comment history and they are all very similar.

That’s my exact plan. I’m going to setup a buy order for £20-£30 for the end of every month and just keep transferring it into a software wallet.
Do you recommend me setting up a maker order in coinbase pro ready for if BTC drops?

So does running your own node mean that you can get your own transactions confirmed a lot quicker? I send coins around very often

Thank you for the link! I can't wait to have a read! I should say, I'm not a complete noob when it comes to bitcoin and I intend to hodl. I've had a lot of bitcoin over the years, the most being £900, but I sold it because I needed cash, and then the price spiked to the highest ever! That was a real bummer, but I've learnt from my mistake.
I intend to continue to buy a lot more bitcoin and I want to look into some more in-depth trading methods, but for now I'm just buying and hodling, and watching BTC rise to the heavens!

Excellent, thank you. Any idea what payment method I can definitely use?

Looks like I’m going to be using coinbase, thank you
