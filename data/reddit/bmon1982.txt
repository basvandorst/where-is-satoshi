Send bitcoin to your friends with dropbit app. They will get prompted to set up a wallet. It uses your contacts on your phone. U can also send bitcoin to your friends on Twitter.

I’ve used abra for awhile now. No issues. It’s legit
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:33:55
Cashapp. Check it out. Instant.

Wow shocker.

I use HODL, it’s great. Open source, btc only, connect to your own node, full bech 32 support also with legacy address. Looks nice. Works good. It is a clone of breadwallet but for btc only. Which I like.

There’s plenty of Segwit wallets. Edge, blue, Coinomi even I think..
@_date: 2018-10-15 02:08:05
Yes they do.
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:48:00
Cashapp homie. Great for buy/sell. They give you a visa to load. It is custodial so not great for storing. Get a wallet that gives you keys for that. Otherwise cashapp will solve your issues.
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:21:01
Dam. Nice man. Hopefully soon everyone can. Still can’t on mine..

This ☝️credited almost immediately

Just download the app an sign up

After the casa software update, the resync bitcoin from casa button was added. I did that and everything works good now. The button is in the manage bitcoin section. Hopefully that helps you. Casa has also started their own reddit r/casanode. U could reach them there. Or try help Good luck.

It’s called To the moon. With keiser

Coinbase Are the baddies. Cash app good. Then withdraw to whatever wallet you want. Or abra is good too.
@_date: 2019-02-17 14:34:04
HODL wallet
@_date: 2019-06-15 04:47:45
Really? I can’t make deposits..
@_date: 2019-02-10 02:04:23
HODL wallet is great
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:40:22
Everyone charges a mark-up. Cashapp and abra seem to be ok. With cashapp it’s not your keys tho.
@_date: 2019-02-16 16:47:53
HODL mobile app if you want that kind although it’s btc only. (Which I like) or trezor if you want hardware wallet offline. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 10:48:53
@_date: 2019-02-05 09:27:25
Second that. HODL wallet is great. I’ve tried many wallets and really like what HODL offers. I am sort of a btc maximalist also. I recommend it as well
@_date: 2019-06-23 01:23:32
If you are trying to use a segwit address I don’t think cashapp supports those yet..
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:58:38
Fees aren’t bad. There is no fee sending out to your bank account. There is a premium built in when you buy, it’s not bad tho. Check them out. DYOR. Cheers !

Good luck. Hope it works out. It’s my go to. Never had any issues
@_date: 2019-04-30 12:02:56
HODL wallet. iOS.
@_date: 2019-01-06 06:53:19
It’s pre-synced. When I got it hooked up it was only behind about 3000 blocks. It just needs to sync those..
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:57:55
Good luck with casa support. They haven’t replied to my emails I sent their support yet from a week ago. Ive had my node plugged in for 9 days and it says it’s syncing but it’s not far as I can tell. Neither bitcoin or lightning has synced at all. It’s not suppose to take this long. Idk what’s wrong and they don’t reply to me. When I called them out on Twitter they then sent me a dm asking what’s wrong, I told them and haven’t heard anything back. That was 3 days ago. They only responded to my public post to look good I think.,
@_date: 2019-01-06 08:57:19
Tried that. Didn’t help. Thanks tho
@_date: 2019-01-07 05:28:10
That is all correct too
@_date: 2019-01-06 07:24:36
Buy from cashapp but then store in a wallet like edge where you will have the keys or even better, a hardware wallet like trezor or something like that.
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:48:51
@_date: 2019-01-08 08:58:27
So the market cap going from 69 billion to 70 billion.. probably just a little effect on price.. now if we could only get that cap back up in the 800 billions like it was.. who knows
@_date: 2019-01-07 05:28:18
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:35:39
And hopefully you actually have BTC and not bcash.
@_date: 2019-05-01 11:02:59
I’m not sure what you mean but I’ve had no issues with HODL wallet or the send and receiving from bech32..
@_date: 2018-12-26 13:05:46
You pay someone premiums anyway. Tho 150$ seems a little heavy. Coinbase and even square cashapp upcharges. Depending on how much you wanna buy
