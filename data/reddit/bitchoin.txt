This is actually... bad news

It's on now

I see. But the problem with changing to an altcoin is that the current bitcoins would be worthless so current bitcoin owners would not be interested. Other problems would be that not much mining equipment exists and that much software that works with Bitcoin should be changed to work with the new altcoin. I was trying to think of a solution for this but maybe I was not clear enough.

Get on with it!

I read this before but me and my buddies put bitcoins on MtGox and withdrawn them without verification. Weird.

100 bits
My first tip.

So there are 4 scenarios. Mark knows what scenario is true and is asshole for not communicating it in detail. And regulation or not, you can't just steal stuff from people, whether it's money, cars, bitcoins or whatever.

Most people don't want to have offline computers running specialized software to handle their money. I know I don't. I want it easy and safe and maybe even some protection/refund if my account is hacked like a normal bank account.
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:56:14
I don't think so. This random guy will be hassled for a week at most and then everybody will move on.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:02:43
Thanks. This is all I need.
@_date: 2014-10-20 20:06:34
Yes it does, thanks! One last question if you don't mind. The difficulty of guessing the number is that it must be a correct hash and begin with a certain number of binary zeros, right?
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:56:32
They are dead indeed. If they reopen, who is gonna sell their bitcoins cheap there? Nobody. Everybody will try to get them out to other exchanges and probably not sell there also. People will hold and wait for the price to recover.

I think your right. But you can keep your bitcoins safe on a 3rd party service, like blockchain:  They can't confiscate your wallet.

and we are of to the moon! Thanks Warren!

You've been on reddit for two years and didn't read a single MtGox warning?
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:47:21
Good call, nh
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:11:05
I didn't work either today.
@_date: 2014-03-03 12:05:03
It should, some of the people who lost coins would want to buy new ones I would guess. I wonder what will happen to price if the coins are found and send back to the rightful owners. Price would probably tumble right?
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:27:58
Thanks for your reply. So you don't consider the multi-sig wallets safe for  significant amounts? The theory is that even if they are hacked your money is still save.

"When a product is scarce, consumers are faced with conducting their own cost-benefit analysis, since a product in high demand but low supply will likely be expensive."

I read this on  "Mining is actually a poor name for the process taking place, but caught on due to the hope of completing a block and winning the attached Bitcoin reward." When it says winning the reward, is there some chance factor? If someone completes a block doesn't he automatically get the reward?
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:08:51
Bitcoin will never become mainstream if it is not possible to store bitcoins safely online.
@_date: 2014-10-20 19:42:42
How is it that the chances of 'winning the lottery' are proportional to the ratio of individual hashing power relative to the overall network hashing power? I thought more hashing power means just better chances to complete a block?

Bitcoins can't disappear, but the private keys can be lost.

I don't wanna be a bank.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:02:04
Fiat withdrawels or bitcoin? Bitcoins could be withdrawn without verification right?
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:41:00
Thanks for the tip. How does it work? You boot from USB and then go online to do transactions? What if the USB key is lost (in a fire or so), do you have a backup for the private keys?

@_date: 2014-03-03 12:17:00
Of course it does. Why do you think the price went from 0 to what it is now?
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:04:39
Without arguments his opinion indeed does not matter.
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:52:54
I just ordered something! This is great!
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:07:29
Verification? I didn't need to send that. Maybe only when you wanted to get US dollars out?
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:15:41
Genious video! But seriously, loved it, but please fix the bad spelling as someone noticed.

Gooooood morning Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-03-02 09:09:23
Why did you leave from public view?
@_date: 2014-10-20 21:09:57
I get it. Good stuff. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-12 10:41:42
Why isn't the creation of bitcoins linear? Did Satoshi do it this way in order to keep the price down in the early years?
@_date: 2015-03-03 11:14:20
This could be gentlemen.
