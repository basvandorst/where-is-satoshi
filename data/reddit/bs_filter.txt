Seems likely. I can't guess what other reasons he'd give them up. Then again, maybe they just found his private keys somehow during their theft of all his shit.
I bet a lot of people will begrudge him (irrationally) if he did choose to give them up. Once you're in a situation like that, its not like you can make any "bad" choices. Once someone is threatening to lock him in a box for life with a good chance of shower rape any choice he makes is no longer about morality or utility. It's just about trying to minimize the harm which our bullshit society deems appropriate.

The answer is the graph is a moving average, so it lag indicates the increase in hash rate. That's why each peak for longer moving averages is on the right. It lag indicates the jump in hashrate which occurs at the difficulty increase.

Even if we throw out the state, there will still be private groups that will collect debts, resolve grevences, and investigate theft or other property violations. So if someone outright steals your BTC (or NXT in this case), there's always going to be an avenue for you to try and get it back.

Monetary policy and government intervention has dramatically manipulated the price of bitcoin. 
The first rise to 260 was following Cyprus.
When the Gov Shutdown ended Oct 16th, and the debt ceiling was effectively suspended, that corresponded with the start of a strong bull market.
This bull market continued when Congress began their hearing on bitcoin.
The first time bitcoin bounced off 430 USD, that marks the day that Ben Bernanke said bitcoin may hold promise. That price continued to be a strong floor in the months that followed.
The Fed taper may partially explain the decline in recent months, though Mt. Gox will take the brunt of that one. Also, China.
Yesterday bitcoin had a very timely response to Draghi's speech.

Weeks, months, years... If someone were really malicious, they would shock the market by simply moving the funds around, make people think he was dumping, and then "legitimately" buy NXT for cheap to arbitrage when it rebounded.

I think the liquidity problem exists. Selling this wouldn't be "easy", but it's not an insurmountable problem and there would be some advantage to having a large share of the currency.
There may not be an incentive to rush. Because of POS, this hacker would earn NXT simply by holding it and validating transactions.
Simply shifting around large volumes of a cryptocurrency can spook the market into a selling frenzy. A malicious actor could make it appear that they would dump and then buy NXT to arbitrage when the price recovered.
The other argument that "NXT might block those coins" is more compelling, but it represents a big risk for NXT as well. If the hacker had decided not to make a deal, our discussion today might be about something else very controversial.

Supposing they arbitrarily double your jail time for refusing to cooperate (label you a terrorist or some nonsense) it almost doesn't matter what you do. There are no good choices.

Even though people are optimizing their power consumption to get the most out of their equipment, this is not related to the current difficulty of the bitcoin network.

It's a personal decision. No one has to impose higher fees on everyone else, but if anyone wants a transaction prioritized then it makes sense to tip the miners.
If miners are self interested, then all miners would include a transaction with a generous tip in their transaction list, and it would end up in the next block published to the network. The bigger the tip, the better your chances. Personally, I'm happy to pay a small fee and wait patiently.

I understand. For myself, I want the seed to be rarely used, and only for emergencies because anyone who knows it gains access to everything. If I'm constantly using that seed then anywhere I use it can become a single point of absolute failure.
In most cases, from day to day, I want spending limits on my account which are enforced using 2 of 3 or 4 of 5 multisig. To spend small amounts, I sign and the online service or my second device co-signs. For large amounts, I need any two of those and my two backup keys (held offline). 
The seed allows me to reconstruct my wallet in the event that the company disappears or becomes malicious, and since that company only holds 1 key, they cannot steal any funds.
At least, this is how I would like use multisig, multiple devices, and deterministic wallets.

The price we pay for the protection you describe costs everyone billions each year. All of those protections are necessary only because the payment and banking systems are badly broken.

When people have no incentive to fix shit, guess what happens... Nothing gets fixed. Profit gives people an incentive to obtain *value* which they can freely exchange for things they actually want.


What we have today is far closer to socialism than freedom, and the results are obvious. Democracy gives "leaders" the power to decide what you can do, and they sell that power to the highest bidder. It's regulatory capture. As long as people have a government to bribe in exchange for preferential treatment you'll be footing the bill.

The arbiter "layer" allows for inflows and outflows of fiat. This layer also allows people to speculate on BTC without actually holding it (which some will prefer). Those with BTC can directly exchange cryptographic smart CFD's, but if they want to cash out in fiat they can use any arbiter (or any other way people sell their BTC).
The advantage of using separate layers is that if any one arbiter fails none of the customers who used them to get BTC will be exposed. Accounts held in fiat will be at risk, but arbiters will be vetted by reputation (as we see on LBC) and the overall risk to people using such a platform will be lower since many arbiters will compete to provide services. There are, no doubt other measures that arbiters can offer to attract customers who may want to open fiat accounts with arbiters, like security deposits that settle in BTC to the customers wallet (or something).

Bitcoin is digital property. The transaction fee you pay incentives miners to include your transaction in their blocks.


Fiat/crypto exchange rates (fees) are a separate topic. If no one is willing to pay 10%, then companies won't make any money. If other companies (or people) can offer a better rate, then companies will compete to see who makes money.
Exchanging fiat for Bitcoin is a huge hassle for some people in some places. Not everyone and not everywhere, and this is an important area for improvement.

If OP can come back with a signed message that proves he controls a bitcoin address which sent 100BTC to an address which was swept to Johoe's, and then if OP can sign a message that proves he controls a blockchain.info wallet with 100 BTC recently sent to it, then it won't matter how old his reddit account is.

The actual increase came with the difficulty increase, but the moving average lag indicates that increase.

Using bitcoin is a huge advantage for as long as most other people do not understand it. It's still useful beyond this point, but at that point we no longer have an economic advantage over other people.
The fact that we know something other people don't puts us a step ahead. That step ahead goes away when everyone starts on the same level.
The longer people take to learn about bitcoin, the better off I'm going to be.
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:47:37


Yeah, this is true. There are two other big problems we can discuss.
If the delivery company fails to deliver the product, there doesn't appear to be a way for the customer to collect their 3BTC, and they're at an economic disadvantage compared with the person who only put up 2BTC. Here again, extortion becomes GTO strategy. This seems to me like a critical problem since merchants are asking customers to take on significantly more risk when buying their products.
Even if the problem of sending can be resolved, retrieving your BTC after the transaction has problems. Once both parties have funds stored, there can still be a negotiation where either party can hold the other ransom for extra funds. If I can wait you out, and you cannot then it becomes GTO for me to pressure you to give me more BTC.
This second problem can be solved. One would need to use a smart contract where the spend value is defined before any money is sent making it cryptographically impossible to settle the holding account in any other way.
Bitcoin already has code which solves the "who goes first" problem. Basically one can create a transaction which doesn't send until a predefined sum of BTC is ready to send. In your example, the sum would be 4BTC. Using this function, sending can be trust-less even though it isn't simultaneous. A similar feature might be employed to fix this second problem.

I'm in no position to recommend the services of others. There are many out there and each have their benefits and risks. My preference is to use several services and spread out my risk.
A paper wallet is basically a sheet of paper with a bitcoin public/private key pair on it. You can find open source software that generates them offline. It's probably the most common way of storing bitcoin "offline".
Lets say you generate a paper wallet on a device that's not connected to the internet. Then you print out the paper wallet. You can send bitcoin to the PUBLIC address, and they'll be stored. To spend, you use the PRIVATE address.
It's always important to do your homework because if ANYONE has your private key they can spend your coins. Or in the case of multisig, they need enough private keys to spend. Done properly, your bitcoin can be more secure than any digital property before bitcoin.

This clears things up. What you said before is a classic responses to people who confuse correlation and causation, which I didn't do, and so it made sense for me to ask.
Moving on, correlations can be statistically significant and conceptually important even if they don't cause one another. Sometimes they're caused by a 3rd variable.
In any case, when things "go together" that's a good place to start when you want to understand what might cause one or the other.
Also, there's an ordering effect. We know those companies offered digital content before accepting bitcoin. So if there is a causal relationship, we know it only goes in one direction.
I don't see why you're minimizing the issue here. When something happens that we expect, that's just as useful as something we don't expect. They're both useful information. 
We can still ask, for example, *is there anything different about similar companies which don't accept bitcoin that might be useful to us?* We can still ask *if our expectations about this are correct, are we more likely to be right in similar areas?* I could go on and on.

If there were some discussion about Proof-of-work in this document, then the situation is more interesting. Proof-of-work makes bitcoin's issuance resource intensive, and it's a step along the path to creating a ledger which uses that busywork to verify the transactions.
Anyone who was very seriously contemplating digital cash would have highlighted a number of issues which bitcoin has solved, in particular because solving those problems is a kind of requirement for digital cash in the first place. So we shouldn't be surprised to find a number of similar sounding things in the NSA document. This doesn't mean the NSA didn't make Bitcoin. I'm just saying it doesn't prove they did.

You'd need 3 components. First, the user runs some opensource software on their own computer and inputs their phone number. The software encrypts the number and produces a hash that's sent to Backslash. Second, Backslash would use the hash to generate a unique shared secret which Backslash can match to the unique hash value. Third, the user runs opensource software which generates valid codes using the shared secret and which dials their number to send those codes. Input the code as normal, and Backslash has provable unique phone numbers without ever needing to know what it is.
The second component is tricky, but my impression here is that cryptographers already have a solution that would make sure users can't simply take the valid codes from the client-side software and submit them without using their phone.

The current banking system uses pull transactions. To send you money I have to give your bank my personal information, which they use to pull money from my account. That's not consumer protection. It's a vulnerability which frequently leads to fraud.
The moment someone has your personal information they can give a bank the authority to draw money from your account. To cope with this huge security flaw, banks have been granted the authority to reverse transactions. This solution is expensive, and costs me personally 100's of dollars a year as a consumer. Price hikes and bank fees.
Bitcoin uses push transactions. Like sending an email. Consumers are protected because their personal information is not required in order to send money. This is consumer protection.

You might be right. There's another option though. We might also find a responsible and widely accepted way to do this kind of "crowd-sale" thing.
Lots of people have freely given BTC for pre-sales, and that's a sign of "success" but lots of other people say "no way, this format doesn't work for me." So there's a direct incentive to find a better format than the one people seem to have adopted today because a better format will actually earn them more investors.
The argument that they're raising free money I think falls flat. People are taking a risk and those who invest do so with the belief that their risk will pay off. There's always some probability that they will lose. They can also be wrong in their assessment, and perhaps the risks are far too high to justify an investment (which is basically my view here). 
Thing is, millions of businesses have received outside funding to get started in just this sort of way, this still goes on today, and the problems we're identifying here are not new problems.
The real issue in my mind is that we aren't quite at a stage where there are ready-made decentralized solutions to those age old problems so, for instance people can't easily spew money that was intended to fund a real project.

I think this too remains an assumption. It's harder for me to come up with simple arguments, but lets try.
How about the centralization of personal freedoms. Under communist rule, I don't think North Korea has become very profitable. Kim Jun Un is the ruller of this crazy place, and I doubt very much that he's generating a lot more of profit by centralizing personal freedom. We might have the same observations when looking at Cuba.
Countries that do not centralize personal freedoms as much (take your pick) en-mass generate far more profit, and the President also has a lot more money available to spend.
Protecting a centralized solution is also very expensive. A decentralized solution doesn't need to be protected from being co-opted, but a centralized solution requires someone, either through obfuscation or force.

It is the moving average. There's a really simple way you can tell. Larger samples have peaks all shifted to the right.
If the average were calculating in both directions (divided up), then the peaks for 1008 and 2016 would overlap. Instead we see the peaks for 1008 and 2016 are shifted to the right because they lag farther behind the underlying data.
Also, if it were calculating in both directions, you wouldn't see a moving average for the last periods because we cannot predict the future.

Badly broken.
Banking uses a pull protocol. When I send you money I must authorize your bank to pull money from my account. This creates counterparty risk. Your bank needs details about who I am so my bank will authorize that transaction and so we need KYC and AML requirements. This creates all kinds of scenarios where people abuse this authority resulting in theft, fraud, and high fees.
Bitcoin uses a push protocol. When I send you money I do not need to tell you anything about me. You don't need my identity. Settlement is near-instant, and there's no need for trusted 3rd parties.
Insurance doesn't disappear when money improves, but it changes. Also, go fuck yourself.

I think the simple answer is "no one is exactly sure," at least in part because many laws need to draw on real world data to be applied. As an example, consider a last will. Coding one up and defining how your digital assets will be allocated is relatively straight forward. What's not straight forward is the matter of proving that someone IS dead.
There are some contenders for dealing with the problem of giving a blockchain knowledge of "things that happened in the world." One proposal is a [SchellingCoin]( by Vitalik Buterin. These data feeds can be used to inform higher level operations that depend on real world data (like a last will).

When you suggest that i am "a retarded fool" then now we've got a problem.
Here's the problem: 
1) I cannot rationally expect you to have my best interests in mind when you think so little of me. So it makes no sense for me to talk with you. 
2) Also, if you really think I'm "a retarded fool" then it makes no sense for you to talk with me because doing so would mean you're discussing something which depends on logic with someone who's not capable of rising to the occasion.
3) As a consequence, your decision to continue a discussion with someone who you claim is delusional and paranoid and then attack them on a personal level tells me very clearly that you are irrational. For this reason I once again have no reason to discuss any topic which depends on logic with you.
The way this problem gets resolved is quite simple. Cya

We absolutely need independent crypto-currencies and I think sidechains allows them to compete on fundamentals in a more fluid way. Right now I think it's difficult for different issuance models to compete directly because most companies in this space process just bitcoin.
Once sidechains are properly developed that barrier goes away. People will choose to hold Ether or another coin for their own reasons. Then, accepting bitcoin alone means accepting all other crypto-currencies and the differences between coins becomes their issuance model and fees, and the security of their network.

Without equivocation, Bitcoin cannot *try* and it cannot *claim* anything. It's a protocol.
It doesn't try to compete. The competition between BTC and Gold arises naturally when people choose between using BTC and Gold.
All claims about Bitcoin are made by *people* who are fallible and easily misunderstood. For instance: When you claim Bitcoin fails hard I'm tempted to simply disagree, but maybe I'm just not understanding you. I'll admit happily that bitcoin "fails hard" to do some things which some other people have claimed it does. This is easy to suggest because people say some nutty shit! both for and against it.
Finally, the fact that gold has such tight margins isn't golds *doing* just like it's not bitcoins *fault* that margins are wider. It's also true that the margins are a signal of liquidity, which is a human problem. Margins will decrease as more traders enter the market. Shopping online used to be insecure, slow, and unreliable. Now it's great imo. Using electricity used to be dog shit too. It's pretty great now.

It goes both ways. When our over reactive speculators bid the price up, this positively impacts daily users that hold bitcoin, and costs them more if they wish to buy more BTC.
As a group, daily transactors are the least effected by variance in the price. Their gains and losses average out over time, because they're logging daily transactions. 
All a daily spender must do to deal with price variance is buy enough BTC when they have a price they like to last them through the next upswing.

Right now *new blocks* which are large propagate more slowly than small blocks. As a result, large blocks have a higher probability of being orphaned, and this gives miners a reason to exclude transactions with tx fees below a given threshold.
Gavin Andresen is working on a patch so that miners are not disincentivized to include transactions in their blocks.
How does this work? Can anyone break down his solution in simplified, point form?

I'm not a cryptogenius. I've heard a few people are interested to solve this using proof of latency, and perhaps your node reward per cycle would be larger if you are more distant from other nodes.
This would tend to promote node hosting in new areas, and the network as a whole would "want" to cover areas like Africa where bitcoin nodes are few and far between.
Basically, if someone can solve the sybil attack problem, they can also incentivize robust decentralization.

Purpose is a loaded term. All of the logical consequences of the law are equally valid options for the people that are subject to those laws. Otherwise, it's not the law which defines what is permitted by a society. If the purpose of a law defined how people are permitted to behave, then the contents of the law would not matter. Its the law itself that gets examined, appealed, and finally passed; not the purpose for which it is created. The reason for this is obvious: purposes are completely subjective. What is the purpose of a hammer? I say it's purpose is to do whatever I use it for.

Hi Vitalik, 
If we suppose that Bitcoin's issuance model cannot provide price stability and given the assumption that USD provides credible price stability, is it possible for someone to implement a coin in a sidechain that achieves the goal you've identified?
It might take the following form: pegging between bitcoin and this chain allows for decentralized exchange in the side chain where a native currency (like ether) is mined.
Or is my definition of a side chain getting a bit too muddied at this point?
@_date: 2014-07-19 23:13:25
More like a side chain with 1-way pegging.

The digital property represents the unspent transaction outputs that can be cryptographically spent by anyone who holds the key.
If this statement sounds self-referential, an analogy *might* help. Imagine I tie a knot in a length of rope. Think of this knot as "bitcoin." This knot really exists, and "is something" even though its just a certain arrangement of the underlying rope (or 1's and 0s). If I loosen the bindings and slide the knot along the rope, that knot has moved. It's the same knot even though its now constructed from another part of the length of rope, and it still exists in its new location.

More deserving... That's a weird one too. In a moral society, people negotiate. Like, suppose you and I agree to trade 5 dollars for some BTC. We make the trade and go our separate ways. Did I deserve that trade? Would it make sense to claim I was more deserving of the money?
What If I were a jerk and you were really nice; would you deserve the money more, just for being nice? I would say no on all counts. Its a meaningless distinction.

Whenever you can perform more calculations per second, it takes less time to successfully break cryptographic security.
With a quantum computer it might become economically feasible to try and guess someone's private keys, but only if they had a very large balance, and this would be easy to mitigate.
Bitcoin holders would just need to split their balance until it's far more profitable for an attacker to simply mine bitcoin.
This strategy is already being employed today. People know to use multiple addresses if they hold a lot of coins.
So that's what a user can do themselves. On the developer side, they could make private keys more difficult to crack and I think it would be relatively trivial to make keys much more robust against brute force attacks.

All miners have the option to decide how many transactions they include. The reward for mining blocks is considerable.

@_date: 2014-12-13 22:58:57
Here's a couple tips. Start with a small amount and play around. Spend 5 bucks, make a couple web wallets and a paper wallet. Send transactions between them and learn how it works.
After all that, make a fresh one carefully with the things you've learned. Maybe try setting up a 2/3 multisig wallet. This can let you (for example) secure your bitcoin with 1 backup signature on paper, 1 signature from your mobile device, and 1 on your home computer. With 2/3 multisig you need any 2 of 3 signatures to sign a transaction. I think copay lets you do up to 15/15 multisig but that's way outside the need for normal users.
With Bitcoin you can adjust your own level of security. Right now bitcoin is pretty technical. The amount of time and effort and money spent on security should scale with the amount of bitcoin you hold.

If you're wondering what I mean by what I say it's *always* easier just to ask. I'm more than happy to tell you. And this is more reliable than guessing.
What I mean is this: for someone to think that bitcoin can be valuable, most times they need to look at the competing instruments (fiat, gold, etc) and see their limitations. Being able to find the limitations of widely accepted things (like our money) requires critical thinking.
My claim is that lots of people interested in Bitcoin will have needed critical thinking to even see that it could have value. This claim is NOT AT ALL equivalent to saying "someone who likes the same this as i do cannot possibly be dumb."

First question. Answer is no. Bill was talking about JFK. He's been dead 30 years, but lets wake him up and ask his thoughts on taxation.
Second question: Somalia was destroyed by war and civil war long before its state collapsed. 
It's sort of like saying, "if you want a new body, why not take one that just stopped a lifetime of drinking and drugs?"
Taxation is evil, and for one simple reason. People have no choice. They're forced to pay, and force is nothing less than coercion under threat of violence. 
When people use violence as the methodology for resolving disputes, there's no arguing, there is no reason or evidence to speak of. There's a simple reason for this too.
If the way to resolve disputes is with violence, then people use violence to resolve whether that's the case. Any reason and evidence we submit can be violently opposed because the government resolves disputes with violence. 
Taxation is stealing money under the threat of violence.

Gov has a lot of power. If you're coinbase it's extremely profitable when you can get favorable legislation.
If we're talking about coinbase generally, a really interesting trend for me is that fewer and fewer people who use bitcoin are actually holding it. At the same time the comments above suggest that the hardcore community is slowly more interested in holding their coins themselves.
Companies like circle, bitpay, and coinbase... more and more they're settling people's accounts in USD and using Bitcoin in the middle.
This isn't a huge surprise, but I think it will have an interesting effect over the coming years, allowing *the big money* to secure a lot of bitcoin at a very reasonable price before wide adoption leads people to use bitcoin directly instead of as a proxy. For me this means bitcoin speculators need a really long term view.

This isn't an ELI5 but here it is. Generally speaking, there are many forms a decentralized fiat-crypto exchange can take.
One of the prominent features will probably be this: Instead of having one exchange hold all the funds, users will be able to select arbiters based on their reputation. 
Arbiters will build their reputation by facilitating exchanges, proving reserves, and lowering fees. You can imagine an arbiter as being similar to the buyers and sellers on Local Bitcoins, except rather than depositing cash at the time of the transaction to simply purchase coins (or vise versa), you can choose to hold an account with the arbiter that enables you to buy and sell.
To increase liquidity in the market, arbiters will trade among themselves. However, arbiters themselves will not exchange fiat directly but rather swap CFD's (contract for difference) expressed in BTC and settle those CFD's in BTC for the dollar amount. This would allow them to exchange the *value* of dollars quickly by using cryptocurrency while simultaniously using a trustless system that's hard coded.
In the longterm the arbiter they trade with most will probably be a decentralized autonmous corporation, owned by no one that holds BTC and uses smart contracts to process CFD's for arbiters (or anyone holding crypto).

Your statement depends sensitively on the goals you think Satoshi has, which you can only guess at.
If his goal was for bitcoin mining to become less centralized over time, then  shows that bitcoin mining is FAR *less* centralized than when Satoshi himself was mining bitcoins.
If his goal is to make the most secure payment network on the planet, then what OP has shown is that the blockchain is more secure than ever.
The amount of energy consumed by the bitcoin network might be a real problem. Right now it consumes more power than a nuclear plant, but the heat mining gives off can still be utilized to, for example, reduce heating costs. The way people mine will continue to be optimized.
Proof of work is *not* perfect, but it's better than the alternatives people have tested so far. Just look at proof of stake: at first people were very interested, but it naturally tends towards centralization through gradual hoarding and is failing spectacularly as a result.
Bitcoin, by every metric I've considered, is a spectacular success so far and there are lots of reasons to be optimistic about the future.
tl;dr i have no idea how to agree with your statement.

From a practical standpoint, people using the blockchain to timestamp and digitally sign a contract (like marriage) is not at all what crypto-law will be like. The practices you're siting are more like crypto-notarization.

To what extent do you think posts just like this one are divorced from *the free market*?
Lets say for a minute that centralization beyond 50% hash power is a threat to bitcoin (not a huge leap). If that issue goes unresolved, the free markets tendency will be to price bitcoin lower to factor in the risk that a 51% will occur, and the risk of what that could mean.
Systemic threats drive up our expected costs, which means some people cannot profitably use bitcoin to their advantage, which means bitcoin gets priced lower to adjust for a decrease in demand.
Solving systemic problems has a tangible benefit, and highlighting what those problems are is how things get started. Our OP may be increasing their expected utility by harping on this issue because it increases the chance that someone solves it, making bitcoin more reliant, decreasing the expected costs associated with using Bitcoin.
The way you've described the free market here is like it's nothing less than magic, but real people solve problems.

Imo, altcoins are mainly interesting because of the features which they provide that are in some way different from bitcoin. 
Outside of variable mining algorithms that remain contentious (especially proof of stake), anything an altcoin does (faster block times, generalized decentralized computation, stronger privacy) can be implemented as a sidechain to bitcoin.
This in my view undercuts the main reasons people wanted to use altcoins, simultaneously reducing the demand for and the value of them.
If you have an argument that counters any of this, I'm interested.

In a coin that runs on top of bitcoin, one could create a near arbitrary number of currency units with just 1 BTC.
So, suppose 1 mastercoin was worth 625 USD. With very few BTC you could represent today's BTC marketcap in mastercoin. It would effectively inflate the number of currency units, and the demand for BTC would drop.
None of this will likely happen because problems. Sometimes more than 1 bitcoin transaction will be represented as 1 mastercoin transaction, and so fees will be higher making the coin less efficient. Also, simplified payment verification is much harder with mastercoin, since the bitcoin network isn't mastercoin aware and will not reject invalid transactions. To figure out the current account balances you have to backtrace through the transaction history, whereas with bitcoin you just have to check that the block header is correct. At least, this is how I understand it.

There's still a lot of value in experimenting with different types of currency.
Through most of history creating currency was hard. Now it's easy, and so the floodgates are finally open.
Given how restricted currency creation has been, especially compared with today, there's potentially a lot we haven't considered. 
Some new forms of currency we haven't even imagined may yet to be discovered, and the space of possible altcoins is a great resource for exploring new ideas.
Sidechains may also have their own native currency, blurring the line between altcoin and sidechain. Existing altcoins may eventually find themselves in this position.

If we're working with incomplete information (we are) then its always more practical to say there's a chance that an event has occurred, and then calculate the expected impact this chance has on the value of (in this case) bitcoins.
The sum of all possible outcomes multiplied by the estimated probability of each one gives us the expected value.

The ability to send BTC to people without wallets is interesting. I'm curious about how exactly they've set it up.

The story people are discussing in this thread leaves me with a lot of questions. Even if I'm off on a few small details, I think there's a significant chance the hacker has a personal stake in BTER. 
Here's why:
Negotiations are most likely to succeed when everyone has something to gain. So, If the hacker was going to make a deal, this happens *before* NXT decides against forking. 
Reason being, if they forked the hacker would get *nothing*, NXT loses some integrity for reversing transactions, and BTER would lose customers for shoddy security. Here, *everyone* had something to gain by negotiating, so that's when you expect a deal.
So the question becomes, why would a hacker with 2mil USD worth of NXT make a deal *after* they decided not to fork? 
Once the community decides not to fork, everything changes. The hacker's loot is no longer threatened. BTER begins negotiations out 2 million, from a point of absolute weakness. NXT has already made their decision.
So, what could BTER reasonably offer to the hacker come out this far ahead? 440 BTC is worth $225k, and I'm hearing the hacker kept 8 million NXT. This suggests the hacker lost 1.25 million dollars in this negotiation.
Then the question is why? It's not like making this deal would resolve the fact that he broke laws. He's still going to be hunted down for this crime.
Once NXT decides not to fork, the hacker doesn't have much to gain by negotiating, and BTER is in no position to negotiate, which makes this deal very strange.
However, a hacker would be willing to accept this agreement when they retain a personal stake in BTER that's worth more to them than 1.25 million.
I would strongly consider whether or not this is an inside job, or whether this hacker negotiated for a large stake in the exchange.

Being skeptical until you get some evidence, as your experience demonstrates, is perfectly reasonable.
My intention here is not to cast doubt on the whole story or say it's a lie. Not at all. 
What I know is that providing solid evidence settles the question. Is BCI providing a secure service? Evidence decides. Did this person lose 100 BTC due to bad security? Evidence decides. Were they refunded after the fact by honest individuals? Evidence decides.
Likely or unlikely... we don't need to speculate or argue when the blockchain has the information we need to settle the issue.

I Just told you that generalization is nonsense. How was it ever "my generalization" when you didn't even ask what I meant?

So, I just told you that's not an accurate interpretation. Your interpretation was wrong, and rather than asking for clarification you made a stupid assumption. 
The consequences are inevitable: you end up with some stupid argument which is easy to discredit, but don't pretend it's "my argument" when I just told you it's not.

For starters, the transaction logs are not public and so dormant bitcoins may be held in reserve to represent these off-chain transactions.

Would this *increase* our dependence on nodes (by changing the relationship between nodes and miners)? This is my question.
It seems to me that if miners are no longer required to publish all of the transaction data with each block, then we would rely on nodes more heavily to provide accurate data, and that nodes would become more important.
I don't really expect an answer here, but I think it's an area to pay attention to.

I encourage you to find a situation where you think violating property rights is moral given that: 1) **property** is the product of your labor and your body, and 2) **right** is the absolute freedom to decide how or by whom a thing is used.
Categorically I think most people would say evil is intolerable. So if someone is wronged, but they accept it, then they might say it's not evil.
Clearly it's not up to me what other people accept. So, if you want to tolerate someone who steals from you or violates your body then that's your right. Totally not my call.
If you ask me though, I think we shouldn't tolerate people who make immoral decisions and do not repair the damage. Spanking kids is just assault on the most vulnerable group in our society; apportioning wages without consent (taxation) is just theft; forcible arrest and confinement is just assault and kidnapping, and I think our society would be a lot less evil if we stopped doing those things.

If people want to protect themselves, then they *always* have the *option* to make different *decisions* to that end.
People made their own *choices* with their own money. This is not new.
We can say that Ethereum is a high risk investment. It is new. It doesn't exist yet. Maybe we aren't even sure if there's a market for decentralized applications. All those things are true. 
Ethereum is very high risk. Even more risky than bitcoin. Big risk. It could fail in various ways.
However, there is no trick. A trick requires deception. They are not being deceptive about the project.

In 1991 roughly 95% of Americans homes had only a land line telephone. ~3% had mobile phones. That same year we got second generation mobile phones: digital signal transmission instead of first gen. analog signals.
Today, ~25 years later, fewer than 15% of households have only a land line. More than 80% use mobile phones. Smart phones have captured 65% of the market in 10 years.
So today perhaps 100% of American homes use analog money: US dollars. Perhaps just 3% use Bitcoin.

Coinbase takes nearly all of the benefits that bitcoin creates and throws them out the window.
You don't control your funds. They can prevent you from sending/recieving money arbitrarily.
These are exactly the kind of reasons people wanted to use bitcoin instead of a bank.
Do your own research. I would recommend checking out BitGO. They never have spending authority on your account and cannot shut you down. All funds are held in multisig wallets, so you provide any 2 of 3 keys to spend and BitGO holds one key to co-sign. You get a printable backup so if they ever shut down you can always get your money, and even if they become malicious or someone tries to coerce BitGo they only hold 1 key and can never spend your money.

Very few BTC can process a very large number of transactions in house when two things are true: merchants immediately convert BTC to fiat, and customers convert fiat to BTC only when they make a transaction.
The number of BTC a company needs to service customers and merchants may be much lower than people initially thought.
We always knew BTC has a much higher velocity than fiat.
If all customer transactions are settled in house, and one can move BTC 100x faster than fiat, then one may only need 1/100th the amount of BTC to process all of their customers transactions.

Regulation is a promise to resolve conflicts with violence: these are the new rules, and if you don't follow them we'll violate you, your property, and your freedom.
If violence is the way to resolve conflict, then people don't use reason and evidence to resolve whether that's the case. They just use violence.
Any argument we make to the government can be violently opposed because the government resolves deputes with violence. Any evidence we bring can be violently opposed because they resolve conflicts with violence.
It isn't rational to argue with someone who will use violence to defend their position.

If the question is about fast access, having nodes in data centers connected directly to good fiber lines is faster for more people than a node set up in someones basement. Exceptions to this are easy to find, but the nodes which provide good service to the largest number of people will be the ones in the best locations.
If the question is about information security then running many nodes on GCE centralizes fast access, but I don't think it would jeopardize the data integrity. Needless to say, not all nodes can be run this way.

Sometimes it's actually worth holding USD over the short-medium term. It often seems like the BTC community would resist this view, but I could be wrong.
For the last several weeks USD has been increasing in value against many assets: gold, silver, BTC, other fiat currencies... The end of QE (for now) has at least given people a hawkish impression (for now).
The same thing happened in 2007 during the credit crunch: dollars gained value against basically everything. The illusion of fiscal conservatism on the part of the fed is valuable for the USD.

I like it because if this becomes an industry standard then fractional reserve banking will be exposed. Most people have no idea that banks only hold 3-10% of the money.

The difficulty is a value which adjusts automatically every 2016 blocks. It adjusts up when the average block time over that 2016 block period was LESS than 10 minutes, and adjusts down when the average block time over that period was MORE than 10 minutes. This is how the 10 minute block time is maintained.
If the hashrate of the bitcoin network has been going up, then blocks will be found faster than 10 minutes per block, and the difficulty increases to target a 10 minute block time. If the hashrate goes down then Bitcoin's block difficulty adjusts the other way.

Bitcoin is intrinsically more secure in at least one very important way: if I want to send money, I don't have to tell anyone how to draw money from my account.

So it's digital property (in the form of a contract with a service provider) that's authenticated using a shared secret (a private key). Pretty cool.
It would get a few tweaks depending on the service being offered, and i'm thinking specifically about how funds are sent by the user to the phone. The example in the video sounds a bit like pay as you go with a few important problems.
The provider has the private key, so they have spending authority on the account along with the user. In such a case the user can't securely use this as a hotwallet because the provider also has that key, and the provider has no incentive to require payments by asking users to send to that address because if funds were *ever* sent to an unidentified address both the user and service provider might be accused of fraud. After all, only those two are supposed to have spending authority and their incentives are not well aligned.
Also, by sending money to the address the user would consequently identify that this address was in use which would be otherwise unnecessary for identification via shared secret cryptography.

Maybe you were expecting a kind reception and didn't really think someone would give you problems for harvesting personal data. Fine, I get that; people don't choose their words carefully around friends.
However, what you're saying doesn't make sense unless I give you a lot of benefit, which I won't do. Your argument for keeping personal data isn't even internally consistent. It doesn't make sense.
If the real argument here is "keeping your data is probably useful to us for reasons we haven't decided, and using personal data to get unique users is easy." Well, that argument makes sense. I wouldn't do it myself, but at least the argument is not bullshit. It's not good for customers because they don't need you to need their data, but that appears to be a cost for using your service.

I think by far the most interesting take away from this graph is that (with just 1 exception) no matter how many bitcoins someone holds, the number of wallets of that size are *Increasing*.
The only exception to this is wallets with 50 BTC, but these were over represented early due to the fact that all blocks were worth this value and they were often left untouched (mainly by satoshi).
So suppose early adopters were dumping BTC. I would tend to expect that fewer large balance wallets would exist with more small ones.
The supply is growing, and those coins must go *somewhere* but what's interesting to me is this growth across the board.

I knew I should have put *prove* in air quotes... Yes, it's impossible to test randomness when it's defined in certain ways. I have a feeling your definition is probably more suitable in this case.
A seed which produces numbers which appear indifferent from random is actually random by some definitions, specifically the one Stephan Wolfram talks about in NKS.
In any case, if you do as instructed and the numbers are non-random after 10s of thousands of trials, this "proves" it's *not* random. Which is why it's a good place to start; can we reject the statement "this is random." if we partially define random as a set which produces a *uniform distribution* after many trials.

I'm still learning about this but here's my understanding so far.
Sidechains are a separate crytographic blockchain which you can peg your bitcoins to. You send bitcoins as normal to some mainchain address which credits your chosen address in the side chain in such a way that you can also send the coins from the sidechain (perhaps using a proof-of-burn) to release your bitcoins in the main chain back to the address of your choosing.
With a side chain people are free to try things that would be risky in a way that will not expose the main chain to risks. It seems possible that anything other altcoins are doing can be implemented as a cryptographically secure side chain.

I don't think its about history. When all transactions ARE in the blockchain then we can prove that the record is internally consistent. Its very straight forward to take any coins in any wallet and trace them back to their genesis. This is a powerful feature that allows anyone to easily see that coins come directly from the mining process at a certain time in the chain, and that those coins are the real deal.
I think its a huge mistake to think people who are worried about pruning the blockchain are just interested in "historical blah blah."

If someone randomly spams transactions onto the blockchain, that doesn't make bitcoin more valuable, so there are examples where transaction volume is not a reliable indicator.

What if we started a higher level currency to reward full nodes? Call it NodeCoin or whatever, and pay out using something like proof of stake. No premine.
Right now the trouble with changing the existing protocol is that it would directly impact miners who are already operating on thin margins.
If we created another currency which paid out to nodes, perhaps it would take time to gain value but it would gradually approach a level that properly compensated people for resources.
I'm sure there are some problems, but I expect the solutions are mostly known.

3rd party auditing. If some cryptogenius with an honest track record edits the code, and it's provably the same code, I'm happy to start testing a wallet with a few Satoshi.
I see what you mean now and I worded my post poorly. I don't know if a system to check the code for provable security is going to be a near term option.
People will build resources that can be trusted after months and years of testing and then someone just calls up that resource when they builds a wallet. That's how AES works. Once it's out there and tested we don't even have to re-make the wheel, we just copy one that already works.

I've heard some developers talk about the issue of block size, including Ethereum's cryptogenius, Vitalik Buterin. The audience asked him if block size was a critical limitation for bitcoin. His answer was clear: it would be trivial to increase the block size when the time comes.
Miners do have some incentive to publish small blocks because they propagate more quickly and so they're less likely to be orphaned, but finding a block which becomes orphaned is not likely enough for this to be a huge consideration for miners. So large transaction volumes won't be a problem there either.
Aside from this, the # of transactions which can fit in 1 block is like almost 2000 right? We're still pretty far off that number.

At the time I wasn't even aware of arguments for NAP, and I discovered some of it's main tenants independently, which was kind of an ah-ha moment. After writing it I quit my job as a research assistant, realizing it was paid for with stolen money, and moved on to other things.

This looks just like local bitcoins except it uses a security deposit, which isn't a decentralized exchange, but rather a decentralized market for fiat/btc exchange.
You won't have a true decentralized exchange until traders are holding just BTC in accounts they control which can use smart CFD's to gain exposure to other currencies, commodities, whatever.

So the basic assumption here EVERYONE makes is that *its impossible to implement XYZ without blockchain bloat, and a large blockchain is bad.*
Why is this a valid premise for avoiding all kinds of innovation? It seems way more likely that people will find a simple way to implement these things WITHOUT bloating the blockchain AND at the same time, our tech will grow to accommodate a larger blockchain.
People want to avoid exposing actual problems by avoiding innovation. It's total nonsense.
Try new things, force the issue, and create a demand for solutions.

I wonder if any Bitcoin companies are suffering today because of the low price?
There must be a few that have over exposed themselves to BTC's volatility.
I know Coinbase hedges against their holdings by shorting the market. They discussed this several months ago at a conference.
I think some of the mining pools will be in an especially tough spot. To their benefit, they probably won't need to aquire new hardware if the price continues down, but selling BTC as a profit source means they have higher exposure to price changes.
I think it would be a surprise if not one company got into financial trouble at this price level.

RE: corrosion of public discourse
The ability to rate content is what makes reddit amazing. For whatever reason, people like a counter which displays how well their submissions are liked. I like it too. 
It's not perfect. My opinion and what I prefer is not the same for everyone, but the front page makes me laugh and teaches me new things every day.
And all of this happens at basically zero cost. This is at least some cursory evidence that monetizing social platforms (using quasi-valuable Karma) is NOT corrosive. It appears to be the exact opposite.
As tipping becomes more common, it will give people *more* reason to make great content. Making a great post takes time and effort, and the more rewarding it is, the more people can invest in doing it.
Of course people will continue to do things that make themselves happy (as they always have). I'm not worried that people will be forever changed into saying only those things which make them a lot of money, and if they try this is the internet where nothing disappears. They'll be exposed like politicians without principles.

If it can be built over ripple it can be built over BTC on a sidechain. The issue with fiat is that you need a person to take your money. Once you have BTC you'll be able to use CDF's and get exposure to USD without actually holding it. At this point you can have a decentralized exchange without any middlemen, but someone/something needs to be there to take your fiat.

BitGo has a good wallet service. Its multi-sig. They hold 1 key to co-sign. You hold the other 2. 1 in backup, 1 for day to day.  Even if their business goes bust, you can recover your wallet using the other 2 keys. So they never have control over your coins, and can't shut you down.
I stored a little with them to test out their service, and have since added more.
If anyone has had a bad experience with BitGo, I'm happy to hear about that. As of now I think they're one of the better services. They have spending limits, 2FA, and they're almost setting industry standards for wallet security.

moving averages sample for x number of periods into the past and calculate an average.
So the 504 moving average is using data from 504 periods into the past, and as a consequence you don't see a peak in the moving average until long after it occurred in the hash rate.
I can't explain why it peaks or drops. I would guess that people increase their hashrate when difficulty goes up, and perhaps they over do it.

It's pretty likely that Coinbase and BitPay will introduce their own micro-payment networks which are off-chain, and that merchants can use this option to offer micro-transactions without the transaction fee.
The problem this creates is that off-chain transactions have none of the security which the bitcoin network incentives by providing block rewards, and they have none of the reliability that public transaction records guarantee.
In this environment I'm sure we'll end up with more high profile defaults on customer accounts along with the traditional fractional reserve banking practices that have created fragile banks.

No no, there's a much bigger idea here. When you get paid bitcoin to read you can provide evidence that you actually read. Users of this site are accumulating evidence which supports the claim that they ... read. And they can share that evidence with anyone in the world, and that record will never change.

The hollywood / banks comparison doesn't work as well here. Banks are far more likely to adopt something like bitcoin and position themselves favorably.
What Jamie Diamond is saying is that they will create their own digital currency using a brand that people know, and use their superior position to "back" it while making small changes that favor them.
This would be more like Hollywood creating Netflix to compete with P2P.
In the end, the result is still a better service - the banks will be wounded but they may still win this round.

Sometimes when people describe "competing the profits away" what they really mean is "you can't expect to earn surplus value." If you really press people on the issue, a lot of people fall back on this statement.
These people will recognize a) that positive sum win/win outcomes are possible through specialization, and that b) when pure competition is present the product of your labor declines toward a value which is equal to your effort. In this way *stuff is still worth doing* because of win/win outcomes, but we can't expect more than this.

Do you think anyone has the authority, without consent, to decide what other people must do? I think the answer to that question is precisely where our disagreement begins. I think you get your own choices, and the same applies to everyone else, and that this freedom is important.
If your answer to the question above is *yes*, then continuing this conversation is completely irrational: when someone believes violence is the way to resolve disputes, then this opens the door for any reason or evidence I bring to the table to be violently opposed. Then, the standard for evaluating propositions has nothing to do with reason and everything to do with violence. It's not rational for me to argue with people like that.
I mean, if I refuse to permit theft, the gov will send someone with guns to collect. They will take me or my property by force. If I resist this attack I might be shot and killed. I submit my taxes out of fear, because my government is violent. I think violence is wrong, and the less we violate each other's property rights the better off we will be.

The assumption that "decentralized/distributed solutions" are not profitable must be questioned.
By what standard have you come to the conclusion that a decentralized system is not profitable?
Mining is decentralized, and has generated a lot of profit.
Bitcoin is decentralized and supposing that Satoshi still has his private keys, building it has been wildly profitable.
Perhaps the focus on decentralization can happen WITH venture capitalist investment because, as the above examples demonstrate, profit motives do exist in building decentralized systems.

First of all, you're moving the goal post here. First you said it's too late. Now you're suggesting there might just be an uptick in transactions despite the fact that we have no data which suggests there will be one.
Secondly, admitting we don't know what will happen and then concluding we should avoid it because it's bad makes no sense whatsoever. Here's a helpful example:


But then you say, “I don’t know what it is; it must be aliens from outer space, visiting from another planet.” The issue here is that if you don’t know what something is, your interpretation of it should stop immediately. You don’t then say it must be X or Y or Z. That’s argument from ignorance. It’s common. I’m not blaming anybody; it may relate to our burning need to manufacture answers because we feel uncomfortable about being steeped in ignorance.

If you can modify the amount being sent from cold storage AND it's automated, then yes. That's no longer even cold storage imo.

The main difference settles around the idea of "how does each currency solve the double spending problem." The double spending problem is simple to describe: suppose i have 20 USD in my account and I create a transaction to send it to you. How do you know that I have not also sent that 20 USD to someone else? If I have, how do you decide who has the money?"
In standard currency, the solution is to have a trusted 3rd party, a bank which settles the accounts and makes sure no one can spend money they don't have. It's a solution which creates counter-party risk: if the bank is corrupt, the system cannot work.
In Bitcoin, the solution is to validate transactions on a first-come first-serve basis, and the way you decide which transaction is first is by having computers solve a difficult problem in order to publish the transactions, and then listing all transactions on a public ledger, the "Blockchain". The Blockchain, is litterally a chain of blocks. Each block contains transactions, and each block also has a cryptographic signature in its header.
Earlier transactions are contained in earlier blocks. Later transactions in later blocks. Every blocks signature depends on the signature of the previous block and the transaction data within the block itself, so if anyone attempted to change the public ledger, it would change every single signature of every block after it, and the tampering would invalidate the later blocks.
There's more to it, but this should give you something to chew on.

This statement is false.
Bitcoin has value BECAUSE, for many people, it can be hoarded better than existing options. No overhead, no fees, etc.. It's a store of value and its utility functions, for some people, will be preferred over existing options. Those people will have an incentive to pay more for bitcoin because of this advantage.
Merchants also give bitcoin value because merchants give users more options. Some options for some people will be preferable to existing options, allowing those people to gain a marginal advantage in the market by using bitcoin. Those people will bid more for the currency in order to exploit that advantage.

I mean, only someone who didn't know what Ethereum is would agree with this title. Counterparty and Ethereum are very different. Especially because Counterparty exists and is already being used to create valuable assets, but also because counterparty cannot perform distributed generalized computation. If Ethereum succeeds in their goal, it will.
All that said, Ethereum's crowdfunders will still be terribly disappointed with their greater than 70% losses (my estimation on a 5 year time horizon), but the project can still add something new and valuable.

True. No one is omniscient, and only I can clarify what I mean. So with this knowledge in mind it's strange that you did not ask me for clarification. Instead you guessed - which, as we've established, is an unreliable way to learn what someone thinks.
However, our discussion up to now gives me no reason to listen to your observations about the nature of reality. There are two reasons why. You've demonstrated that you do not depend on a rational methodology for learning about the world (guessing instead of collecting data).
You also have not accepted the clear logical error you've made in this short discussion (stick-man argument) which suggests to me that you don't care to signal to others that you can learn from mistakes.
You can lie to me if you like, but if you lie then it is not rational to expect me to listen for those two reasons: even if you are right (as in this last post) I have evidence that you depend on an irrational framework to form arguments (could just be a lucky guess), and when you are wrong I have no evidence that you're willing to integrate corrections into what you tell to other people.

You're making a false Dichotomy. If people flock away from fiat, they are not stuck using bitcoin.
They could easily create their own currency with no premine, and combine that with an algo that distributes it's currency in a way that disincentives hoarding.

this. Both versions would exist and continue on, and since the forkCoin is being artificially inflated with no additional benifits, consumers would trade their forkCoins and add to their BTC holdings which would crash the price making forkCoin actually a huge money loser for miners.
In some wacky plan, the miners might decide to 51% the old chain, but others would have a strong financial incentive to combat this quickly bringing us back to square one: 21 million bitcoin and a very secure network.
The moment a drop in miners started to happen, others would already have strong incentives to replace them, so nothing even this dramatic is likely to happen.

So if we put ourselves in the shoes of Bitcoin critics and consider how they would respond in this situation, its discourteous but also risky to assume that they would be on the defensive when businesses used age-old tactics to continue a working relationship. If this were a boxing match, the only reason our opponents would appear weak here is to expose your assumption and knock you out as you rush in for the finish.

The maximum and minimum amounts are set to 25 and five respectively.
From the white paper. This basically means as hash rate grows, the supply growth decreases to 5 coins per block. If the hash rate collapses, supply growth can increase up to 25 coins per block.
This issuance model is high variance. Price and hash rate co-vary. As prices fall, hash rate and then difficulty fall. As the supply rate increases from 5 coins per block, that increase in supply growth further reduces prices, perpetuating a cycle which will at least stabilize once the issuance rate reaches 25 coins per block.
There's nothing "bad" about volatility in my view. One can balance against volatility by making a smaller investment, but I think this issuance model is interesting. I wouldn't have picked it.

Hedging is like betting against the thing you benefit from so that you do not suffer if the thing you benefit from becomes less valuable. A farmer may hedge against his exposure to volatility in wheat prices by "shorting" the market price (betting it will go down, and agreeing to settle for the difference in the future). If the price doesn't change then the farmer pays the fee associated with the contract and generates the usual profit from their business. If the price of wheat goes way up, he loses money on the short contract, but makes money on the business to counter it. If wheat prices collapse, his livelihood is not jeopardized because the short contract protects him.

There's a critical flaw in your reasoning. It's hume's "it-ought" problem. Fortunately there's an easy way to state your argument without it.
First the problem: Suppose it's true that the charity simply wants that information for future contacts, and it's true that Coinbase wants your information so they can comply with the law. These two things by themselves in no way mean someone ought to feel comfortable provide those details.
Similarly, you yourself may have no problem providing that info, but the fact that you are not uncomfortable does not mean other people ought to feel the same way.
You could have gone another way in this argument. You could have defined what "Bad Practice" is, and then showed that this is not bad practice by that reasonable definition. If you inferred that "bad practice" in this context is "bad business practice" then we can say that jeopardizing the business is part of any definition of bad business practice. Complying with a regulatory body who has the power to shut down your operations does not jeopardize the business. So you could have shown that it's *not* bad practice, without an is-ought problem.

If the mempool transactions all have small fees, then it may be easy to explain. 
There's a large incentive to have one's block be the first one (how else to collect the block reward). Smaller blocks propagate more quickly, and the need to be first means one is inclined to create small blocks.
A transaction fee over a certain threshold makes it worth the risk: grow the block size because the fee produces a larger expected reward than the expected loss associated with the increased probability of producing an orphan block.
Miners have a disincentive to carry low fee transactions because the expected value of publishing a block with this transaction plus the fee is actually *lower* than leaving the transaction out.
If the transactions do not have small fees, then maybe there's an inefficiency in the way miners are constructing blocks.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:29:33
I really like the elegance of this explanation: if full nodes accept as valid blocks that would previously have been invalid, then those nodes have forked.
So I guess what this means for people who use Bitcoin will depend sensitively on the nature of the change.
In this particular case where the forked block sizes are due to increase next year, will Bitcoin users have two transaction records that represent one "history" OR will the transaction records represent different histories? And in each case, what does that mean for people who use bitcoin?

I actually don't think this is right at all. Peter dislikes bitcoin because he thinks it has no utility value. Schiff truly believes that utility value is very important, and you can tell because he discusses it all the time: silver in solar panels, gold in electronics... etc etc. It's not some fear based dislike of Bitcoin. It's based on what he thinks matters in a fundamental, principled way.
 
So the question that matters is: does bitcoin have utility value? I think it does, because you can use bitcoin to construct other assets. And perhaps, as he starts to see this happening he'll understand that too. 
Schiff is not threatened by Bitcoin. Schiff is continuing to support the thing he thinks is best. If something came along that's better than gold and he knew it was better, Schiff would instantly adopt that other thing. There's no reason for him to be emotionally tied to gold. He thinks it's the best, and who's to say he isn't wrong.
If Peter Schiff really thought that Bitcoin was better money than gold and would subvert his hard work to create a Gold backed bank, then he would just make the smart business decision and go into Bitcoin because eventually it would win out anyways.

Far be it from me to expect an honest and thoughtful discussion which evaluates Bitcoin as less valuable than we might first expect, but it's actually not correct that he thinks an infinitely divisible money is not scarce. His concern about scarcity in Bitcoin is that anyone can create a digital currency, and they're all (to him) more or less the same.
We know that the network is more secure with bitcoin, but it remains to be seen exactly how much hashpower is needed to produce good security, and whether it can easily be repeated, and whether this threshold is being reached much of the time.
Some of the things I think make Bitcoin the far and away best available cryptocurrency might not turn out to be as valuable as I first thought, and so providing a very similar product might not actually require everything we see in Bitcoin. This competition among similar products would be very similar to increasing the total amount in circulation.

Thanks, your post actually broke down what I was asking for.
So if I've understood: use the block data to make a data seed, which is small and propagates quickly and from which people can determine if their transaction has been confirmed.

OK, two ides for testing this:
1) Compare all orphaned blocks against the mainchain block that beat them. If the orphaned block is larger with greater than a 51% probability then competition exists among transactors. Reason: The other miner who's produced a competing block will tend to select the same large fee transactions, and therefore those who pay the larger fee out-compete to have their transaction logged first.
2) Compare all orphaned blocks against each other. If larger blocks have an exponentially higher probability of being orphaned then transactors are competing.
In both cases, the prediction I want to make is that larger blocks are exponentially more likely to be orphaned.

Well, this is a very good question. And now you can well imagine why I see it as not possible for this to be correct. I don't want to muddy the water here so let me state my view as clearly as I can:
All non-violent disputes must be resolved non-violently in order to be rational. Using violence instead means the outcome is not determined by reason, evidence, or respect for personal preference, and without those things it cannot be rational.
When a judge forces someone to go to prison they're resolving a *non-violent* dispute with violence. The prisoner has no choice. 
The non-violent dispute in this case can be characterized as follows: Ross did something that violates the rules of society. Ross would like not to go to jail, and the rules of our society suggest that collectively "we" want for him to spend time in prison. This is a non-violent dispute.
Now, if the correct way to resolve this non-violent dispute were with violence (forcing him to go to prison) then resolving whether that's the case *correctly* would mean we resolve it violently. By using reason, evidence, and respect for personal preferences to decide how one ought to resolve a non-violent conflict, we show that resolving conflicts depends on those things. Those things cannot be present when a conflict is resolved with violence.
Many people will argue here that it's acceptable to resolve *some* non-violent disputes violently, and that we can determine which ones with reason and evidence. There's a huge problem here; this simply pushes the question one step back, *kicking the can* so to speak. No matter how one tries to wriggle around it always results in a catastrophic collapse that requires one who wishes to resolve non-violent disputes violently to abandon all reason, evidence, and respect for personal preferences.

One very clear claim this poster does make is that BTC is "very undervalued" right now. To the extent that one derives value from price, this is not true at all.
The price is the price is the price. We get a fair bit of variance of course, and the liquidity still isn't quite there (which is the reason why). Day to day moves of 5% are still fairly common, and they don't necessarily reflect a change in value.
Adoption in bitcoin can mean more than one thing. It can be adopted as a unit of account, a store of value, as teleporting magic money (medium of exchange), and as a precisely divisible asset (down to 8 decimal places right now).
As a medium of exchange, bitcoin is far more liquid than fiat and so any company (like coinbase, bitpay) needs less of it to handle their operations, especially if customers spend their BTC quickly with merchants which instantly convert into fiat. Handling all transactions in house is a lean operation.
This kind of adoption does not produce scarcity. Sure, companies like coinbase hold lots of BTC in reserve, but even this is being hedged to insulate themselves against losses due to price declines. So even as they build a reserve, their perfectly balanced bets against BTC appreciation holds prices stable.

Second, creating an opportunity for Josh Garza to address the evidence which suggests he is a scammer should be applauded rather than condemned.

1. Bitcoin is digital money that can be sent peer to peer like email or mp3s.
2. Bitcoin uses a public ledger that everyone shares. People with the most complete ledger that also publish the next block of transactions with a correct answer to a very difficult math problem get rewarded with newly minted bitcoins.
3. Wallets are like email addresses. The public address is the one you share, and the private key is like your password. Anyone with the private key can spend the coins at that public address.

Possessing bitcoin keys means you posses signing authority on unspent transaction outputs. If you have enough keys to spend yourself (in cases of multi-sig) then you have full control over those funds. Ownership is the right to decide how or who uses something.

Blaming other people is the easiest way to repeat bad decisions. Anyone who invested in PayCoin has new information which can help them to make better decisions in the future.

All I tried to do was understand what you meant in the best possible light. It isn't fair to decide that "it's obvious because it was easy to understand." It wasn't easy.
Seeing things from other peoples perspective is difficult. First of all, you have to be capable of understanding that you might be wrong. That's not easy. Secondly, you need to see past all the shitty insinuations that people throw at you that really have no value in a discussion. Not easy. Third, you need to resist the temptation to misconstrue someone's argument to create some critical problem that lets you ignore everything else they've said. This is definitely not easy. So no, it's not easy at all.
Now, keeping in mind that I don't have a lot of time... to you're argument:


The comparison you've presented is *not* the one I am making. I tried to make this clear by stating "I'm inclined to agree with the hypothetical you." One seems intended, the other does not. Suggesting that this is my argument is a straw man attack.
There are millions of ways any two things can be compared. The comparison I made was that they both make it easier to trade drugs. I did not say they were both intended. In fact, I said I think they are *not* both intended.


This is a false dichotomy. Another option is we shouldn't prosecute either one of them. Companies will no doubt continue to screen for dangerous items, and their customers will continue pay them for this service. I do not agree that our options are to have a police state without privacy or selective prosecution based on ideas like *intent* which are impossible to prove philosophically. We cannot know what someone intended. Privacy and security are not mutually exclusive. In fact I feel more secure with privacy.

no no. what i'm describing here is that people will be able to express price in any terms they want.
If you wanted to express and hold value in 1972 corvettes, you could express your wallet in those corvettes. Prices would be presented to you in those corvettes, and you would be exposed to fluctuation in the price of the 1972 Corvette.
You don't need to barter corvettes to buy something. You would just spend the underlying cryptocurrency that you have to represent the value of the derivative that you've selected to express value in, and you would exchange some amount of 1972 Corvettes in exchange for the thing you were buying.

@_date: 2015-05-27 04:43:57


Things get ... strange at this point.
When someone has a gun to your head you're not morally responsible for your choices. Consequently, you no longer have moral choices to make. So if someone has a gun to your head, it makes no sense to discuss whats "morally right." Anyone who pays their taxes isn't making an immoral choice even if the money goes to kill baby kittens because indirectly there's a gun to their head. Whether to pay that tax has no baring on the morality of the person paying, since they're making that decision under duress.
If that makes sense, let's set it to one side for now.
The fact that someone *has* committed violent acts still does not make it rational or moral to force them to go to prison.It's not that I think there are no rational and moral solutions for dealing with violent and immoral people. I just think our society is so broken that none of them are even realistically available in our world as it stands today.
I can *only* speculate about the future and what might work. Keep in mind here, I don't need to have a solution for us to prove that the way we've carried on so far is not rational. I only go on to speculate here at all to consider how things might work. Emphasis on *might*.
I do think one can effectively deny access to a violent person. A group could all make a contract which says "failing to abide by these rules means (a) one must submit to treatment, or (b) one will have their access to the facilities revoked.
So if we're behaving rationally in this example we must resolve the non-violent dispute about what to do with a violent person by using non-violence. Here's how we can do that. They signed a contract which says they'll agree to certain conditions. That contract gave them access to the facilities in the first place. Now that they've violated the contract in some way they can choose treatment or exile by denial of service (all part of the contract). It's a non-violent solution.
Just imagine a private key associated with that person's public address/ID which just stops working. In such a world cryptographic identity, advanced reputation systems, and access based on smart contracts might be very useful. This would allow someone to resolve complicated non-violent conflicts with non-violence, but as I said at the start it's just speculation.

Lawsky thinks that regulating bitcoin will improve the industry and that he doesn't suck at his job.
Generally, it's better to improve things sooner rather than later, so it's only natural that he would want regulation sooner.
He probably thinks he's going to build some fantastic political career on the back of regulating a developing industry. And since it's so favorable to existing banks, he's probably right. The banks will line his pockets with donations because Lawsky's one of theirs.
In the mean time we're forced to deal with his shit rules. These regulations will make using BTC more costly for consumers while exposing them to larger risks by forcing people to reveal personal data to companies. They'll also make it more costly to create a new company, or provide bitcoin services.

You're going to have to be more specific. If you mean comparing the two is bullshit, then you're probably saying the difference I haven't mentioned is "one is intended, and one is not."
I'm inclined to agree with the hypothetical you. I think the person running the site intended to facilitate drug trade. I wish I didn't need to make up your argument just to understand you're fake apology and vague denouncement. Needless to say, I wasn't trying to make a comparison that satisfies every minute issue.
Personally, I also think that intent is an overused requirement under the law. If I intended to make you rich but instead made you very poor that would be considered reckless. I could end up in jail. I think this similarly applies to the postal services. If I intend to deliver your mail, but instead deliver dangerous chemicals to the white house, deliver poisonous foods to relatives, and bring pot brownies to a friend on holiday that too is reckless according to the law, especially when the postal service continues to operate KNOWING that this goes on.

As demand increases, prices go up. Low fee transactions were the only ones that were backlogged. This is not unexpected.
If someone wanted to 'attack' the bitcoin network in this way, they would need to pay significantly more than the usual fee and miners would not think of this as an attack. From a miners perspective, it's an opportunity. From a transactors perspective, it's competition.
Fees of a certain size make it more profitable to carry the transaction than to broadcast a smaller block that has a higher probability of being first. Such transactions incentivize miners to increase supply (construct larger blocks).
It's not unreasonable to expect both miners and users to want larger block sizes.
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:02:52
This also doesn't prove that someone should not attend the conference, but no problem. Maybe that's not what you're trying to do.


Free and open access to information of all kinds is preferable to restricting access. Learning how to protect myself can sometimes involve trial and error. It's impossible to protect people all the time, but it is possible to decrease the chances that someone learns to protect themselves.
Unreliable third party protection sets people up to make larger mistakes later on because they never learned to protect themselves. They only learned to depend on others for protection. Open access to people who may try to scam you is better because it allows people to learn how to protect themselves.
Worse still, the people who block out the "scammers" can be corrupted. If you're really worried about shady people trying to trick you, then the last thing you want to do is let someone else decide what you're allowed to have access to.
If someone doesn't research their investment plans, or if someone accepts an argument because it is being said at a legitimate sounding bitcoin conference, then that's a personal mistake.

I would like to test this assertion: (paraphrased)


Larger blocks propogate more slowly.
As block size increases, the probability of orphaning the block increases.
In order to justify the risk, transactors provide a fee.
Your assumption only remains true if the size of the block and the probability of orphaning are in a perfectly linear relationship.
If we can prove that the relationship is non-linear (the probability of orphaning a block grows in a non-linear way as block size goes up) then we can also prove that transactors compete while blocks are not full.

At least Coinbase set up a one-off contract with a bank. Mark Andreessen talked about this during a 2014 conference. At the time I'm sure they had few options in the market for shorting BTC (and perhaps they didn't like the parties they would need to deal with), so it made sense to construct a futures contract directly with a bank, and given the price action in BTC through that year it could have really helped them. Now there are lots of options. I think Kraken is the latest to offer margin trading.
Depending on the margin a company is willing to tolerate they might simply estimate how exposed they are to BTC (as a percentage of the total value of the company), make a decision about how much exposure they really want, and then use any exchange which supports margin trading to sell (or, technically they could even buy) enough so that they are only exposed as much as they think is a good idea.
Most hedge funds, for instance, won't expose themselves over 1% or 2% to any single instrument. So the company might decide to reduce down so that if BTC flops in price they're only losing 1% (or even ~0%), and if it gains in value they're gaining 1%. Either way, they aren't being slammed as hard by price fluctuation which they might have no part in creating.
Edit: Speculation time. Given an implicit idea that a good company will do fantastically well if BTC appreciates a lot in price, the reaction such a company may have is to short BTC to the point where they will lose money if BTC appreciates, but they'll make it back and far more because the business takes off. It's possible for a reasonably minded company to be betting strongly against the price of Bitcoin.

Robocoin should not have asked you to remove the post. They should use this incident to prove they can rise above bullshit and ego. In the end they did the right thing, and their customers (you guys) deserved every penny (and maybe more). 
They shouldnt try to hide this fuckup. Companies and people start out young and make stupid choices. Doing the right thing after the fact is a massive deal. It says a lot. Hiding mistakes when you've done the right thing after the fact is ANOTHER mistake. I hope robocoin will come around to this.

On this point we certainly agree. And maybe that's all it is... but maybe that's the point.
When I consider all of the bullshit and vague language written by who the fuck knows and you aren't allowed to read it, and all of that passes as "new rules" in government. And when I consider that they want to regulate Bitcoin with all those crazy vague ideas here we have just some guy, writing some code that people can use if they like it, which does nothing besides what it's coded to do. And that's a nice fucking change!

Honestly, I'd love to see all prostitutes using BTC. Accepting money in a way that its immediately and irreversibly sent to a remote location can dramatically improve the safety of your transactions.
While I'm sure everyone here has already recommended several useful providers, let me add a couple extra things to consider.
Above all else, don't bother using wallet software that you do not understand. This is the easiest way to accidentally lose a bunch of coins. Playing around and sending small amounts of bitcoin between addresses that you control can really speed up your learning curve.
Look into Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets. This lets you create many receiving addresses with one "master key". Your financial privacy and security can improve when you use a new address (public key) for each transaction.
There will be some technical hurdles to jump here. It's worth it imo.

Did anyone think for one second to check the USD / CNY exchange rate? This has nothing to do with Bitcoin and everything to do with the Yuan.
edit: oh, i'm sorry. So the very serious remarks that the Chinese central bank may need to inflate its currency which caused a sudden change in its value and was immediately expressed in the forex markets but took longer in the less efficient BTC market is a mystery occuring on one bitcoin exchange that's about bitcoin. My bad.
@_date: 2015-04-04 14:12:04
If you're a prostitute then I wouldn't recommend it. If not, then you'll be taking on some counterparty risk and informing another entity about your pay (boss, gov, and now bitwage). Then there are fees of course.
There's another problem. Besides bitwage, no company I'm aware of will process your paychecks into Bitcoin. We should be asking why that is. If it were already clearly regulated and no one was worried about getting shut down, then I think the big providers in this space would do it. They aren't. That's just another a red flag for me.
If you're purchasing BTC then I think it's still best on something like Bitpay, Circle or Coinbase. Holding your coins is different. Processing regular checks in BTC is different. Receiving payments as a prostitute is very different.
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:35:30


Seriously don't use Coinbase, Circle, or any other software where the provider has your bitcoin keys. Those big guys will be forced by the gov. to do their bidding.
If the service you use has your keys, then your just using a fancy new bank that still has the ability to cut you off at any time.

If i'm going to purchase coins then sure, I would use a service provider like Bitpay or Circle or Coinbase. I even used Mt. Gox in 2011 but never held a balance with them for more than a few minutes and as a result I didn't lose anything when they went bust. 
In all other situations I don't see a reason to use a custodial account but there are reasons not to use them.
Minimizing exposure to all of these companies has already saved me a lot of money and trouble. There will be many more examples like Mt. Gox even in the next 5-10 years.

There's a lot here so I'm just going to pick out the parts I like most.


Consumer adoption is defined as the process a consumer goes through when adopting an innovation. Not a very instructive definition! And the others were worse than Wikipedia. 
Part of the challenge is we haven't experienced new currency adoption organically. The euro was officially adopted by state powers at the end of 1995. They started by fixing exchange rates between all the countries and then exchanged the euro at a fixed rate over the coming months. It's an artificial process, and maybe its the only way your definition of currency adoption is satisfied quickly. As a payment system it still removes several steps from the old system.

If you really feel that banks are holding you back, then fortunately you can decide to stop using them. It would probably be very difficult. Before bitcoin came along not using a bank would hold you back from doing some things that you might want to do.
I think both benefited from each other. Banks want to make money by providing financial services, and the internet companies make money by selling goods.
Banks do a lot of completely stupid things, and that's probably going to get a lot worse as bitcoin grows, but if your held back by banks then maybe stop using them.

Its not clear to me by your post that you understand how HFT makes money. I've spent a little time trying to understand it. This is what I've learned so far.
HFT frontruns trades by exploiting an information advantage over very short windows of time. By putting up some small amount of stock to buy or sell, they can use the act of its trade to infer there's a much larger demand coming onto the market at that exact time. 
Next, they need to create the appearance of liquidity by placing large buy/sell orders on other exchanges which they intend to cancel the moment an order comes onto the market. Without that liquidity the trader won't attempt a large order in the first place because then the price would reflect their order.
So, when an order to sell comes from a trader and their small buy order executes at the "market price" they get out of the way by withdrawing all their other buy orders, the price flashes lower as the phantom liquidity disappears, and the trader can only execute at a lower price. Then the HFT's arbitrage that couple of millisecond window to make a profit.
The way they create that window is by having the fastest fiber optic lines to and from their exchange and all other exchanges and to the trading floors. So the moment a trading firm executes an order it gets to their exchange first before any of the other ones and they can react to that trade in time to create an advantage at the other exchanges before the traders order reaches them.

This is not some guessing game where there are no solutions. There really is a proper way to send a physical item so the end user is assured it's not been tampered with.
A seal which indicates whether tampering took place and a package which prevents damage to those seals are both necessary.
Anyone that looks at cryptography and knows how data becomes secure will know that certain operations need to be performed and the order needs to be just right. That approach gives insight into the nature of the problem when sending items so they can show up and the user knows they're pristine.

So ok, let's say someone creates virtual nodes that share the same memory. Let's say they create a million nodes. What do you think the Sybil attack achieves in this context?
They still cannot move coins or create new coins. To do that would require private keys or new valid blocks respectively. They also can't arbitrarily say they have the longer chain (would need new valid blocks). Maybe they could ignore blocks and refuse to broadcast new data making it seem like the chain was much shorter, but miners would still keep working on the longest chain accepting valid blocks from any  node which provides them.
I might be completely wrong here, but I don't see where faking many nodes creates an advantage for the attacker. I'm not even sure that doing this would freak people out. I guess you could corner off one node and freak people out who accessed that data, but that's it and you couldn't do that to all other nodes from one location.
People have talked about sybil attacks against hypothetical networks where hosting the node is directly incentivized, but Bitcoin is not such a network.

Fractional reserve bitcoin is already here. Even though I hold all of my own coins and many people do, not everyone does. 100% of these other people have a significant non-zero chance of working with a "bank" that is not honestly holding 100% of coins in reserve or in segregated accounts.
I doubt that anyone will explicitly recognize BTC held on the blockchain as more valuable than BTC held in unproven custodial accounts unless the custodian has recently gone bust. That said, I'd welcome the distinction in all cases. 
What I do expect is that fractional bitcoin will continue to grow just as banks push the advantage that fractional banking creates for them. There are many ways to artificially adjust supply even when the public ledger has a fixed and predictable quantity, and custodial accounts seem to me like the largest risk factor for the next few years.

When they print money it's not like everyone suddenly has twice as much cash and everything costs twice as much. If this happened then everyone would know what a stupid idea it was.
Printed money gets into some peoples hands first, those people can go buy things before those items go up in price, and everyone else loses purchasing power. It's a deceptive way of stealing wealth.
Imagine i had a currency, and 400 units were worth your house. So I give you 400 in exchange for your house and the next day I double the amount of currency, making sure to give myself a healthy chunk of that new currency. Now your house is worth 800, but yesterday I just paid 400. Is there anything wrong with this picture?
Or imagine you lent me 400, and agreed that I would repay it tomorrow for 410. Quite a steep rate, but if the supply doubles over night, you're really getting half as much value when I repay, and whatever I spent the money on is worth twice as much in that currency.

There's nothing to stop people from creating their own version of Bitcoin with some variations that may be better/worse/whatever.
One common change that people make is to reduce the block time from ~10 minutes. Another common change is altering the total supply. Or some people will use an algorithm besides proof of work.
Other projects try more dramatic changes. Ethereum (still not released yet) is trying to build a tree chain which allows people to basically run decentralized applications. So like, with bitcoin the miners process transactions. In Ethereum what they're aiming for is a situation where you could pay to have the miners execute any program coded into ethereum.
One advantage to having all of this variety is that each of these currencies are a bit like an experiment. All these currencies compete with each other and people can choose to support whatever they think will win out. Also, Bitcoin is programmable. It can adopt features that really catch on, and it can also interact with other decentralized technologies (see Side Chains).

Every year there's a new term we can't use. Pretending its just a handful of words and symbols is disingenuous. Political correctness is the ultimate "moving the goal post" fallacy. 
I don't get to decide what offends you, and I'm not going to worry if a collection of lines on a page or sound coming from my mouth hurts you. I'm inclined to think you should stop caring what people think of you when you don't care about them and they know nothing about you.

A bet is a bet is a bet: you're making a prediction about the future and wagering something of value on that prediction. Calling it an investment vs. speculation is 100% subjective.
The message is the same: analyzing shapes on the chart to predict future price moves is not a winning strategy. It's the day traders rival to the gamblers fallacy.

It could be a scam. If they're generating a profit when people use their site (ads) and people spend time on the site because they're hoping to get paid out, then that deception in exchange for ad revenue would make it a scam.

The better questions are what are the consequences of being caught, and how long can they get away with this? Are there any consequences for someone who sets up a site like this?
If the expected gains are greater than the expected costs then getting caught isn't enough to deter people.

I'm not confused.

Speculative value brings speculative adoption, but this doesn't generate long term value. Bitcoin won't die because it happens to be really useful and has many applications. The hoards of weak hands that enter the market when the price climbs are just creating boom/bust cycles in the underlying industry. When Bitcoin's price pops for speculative reasons people make bad investments with their time and money which come back to bite them when the price corrects.

They didn't really need just 1 BTC did they? Was this more of a proof of concept?

Price movements are like engine heat. They're a byproduct of the underlying process. If the car breaks down the engine goes cold.
Using technical analysis to make investment decisions is like deciding an engine fire can get you home in time for dinner.

So you're aware your website was flagged as risky by McAfee Site Adviser.

Did I say Slaughtering millions of people was ok? Fucking no. Using violence to resolve non-violent disputes is ALWAYS irrational. We're talking about words and symbols. And you're going way out of your way to associate me with fucking nazis.
and nice edit.

What's your comment worth?

So he's using a clever bit of fake ignorance to create a story. When he says Satoshi Nakamoto he really means Dorian who was rumored (by a very sad writer) to have created Bitcoin. By pretending to have no idea what he's talking about he can talk about Dorian to confuse the issue once again. Then the story gains credibility when Dorian pays his taxes and bla bla bla. Fucking shitty journalism.

Considering the nature of this attack, this is a very generous decision.

Oh yeah. Thanks. 
But but spacetime? Actually who am i kidding, there's no getting out of this stupid moment.
