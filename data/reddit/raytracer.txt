Bitcoin goes above and beyond that. It's not a get rich quick scheme, it's not a tool to make a quick buck. it's so much more than that. 
Bitcoin is freedom. Freedom to give and receive, freedom to manage, freedom to contract, freedom to create. This is what will drive bitcoin adoption: the understanding of the potential of blockchain technology and one of its applications, which is bitcoin.

Your freedom ends where another one's freedom starts, so by that logic expressing your opinion does not negate another person's freedom, but killing someone is preventing another person's right to live.

I'm sorry to be that guy, but... actually, two cars of the same mass that collide head on at 35 mph will both experience a deceleration equal to hitting a brick wall at 35. You do not sum the two speeds.
Anyway, people should wear a seat belt at all times while in a vehicle.
