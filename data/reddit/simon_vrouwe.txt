People should realise that money at their bank account is NOT their money. Your bank account is just an IOU, its not 'real' central-bank money like cash. Stop begging goverments to 'save' the people by bailing out banks when they fail, socializing the cost and encouraging banks regless behavior. Instead they should alow banks to fail and shareholders and depositors should suffer the consequence. Then people think twice before choosing a bank and banks will be hold accountable.

I guess the whole idea of Bitcoin is to eventually stop thinking in terms of fiat. I know it's a long way to go and requires stability. Perhaps the futures marked can help with that by hedging your bitcoin balance (in your channel).

I think that is one of the good things about them, makes them less vulnerable for (angry) banksters and regulators blocking the exchange's bank accounts.

When block reward is lowered in future and fees become main source of income, miners have an incentive to harvest as many transactions as possible to collect the fees. Miners or pools might even subsidize (full) nodes to direct transactions to them. And I think those relay nodes should be full nodes to defend (the miners pool) against DOS attacks.

Bit off topic, but when I play that video on firefox, it consumes 70% cpu (plugin container as shown in system monitor). Is that normal?

I believe it is this is the full address (by searching in [blockexplorer]( [1LUvRXqfYahKieaV8r7SBxxXYrwmDmuHcM](
Don't know why they left out the last four characters.

Tried to book a flight from amsterdam to sydney on destinia.com for my parents, selected a flight from Malaysia airlines, but option to pay with bitcoin was not there. I called the help desk an the lady told me that this was because some airlines, i.e. the budgets ones, only accept credit card! That's a bummer.
I find it strange why some airlines only accept credit card. Can't be because they are afraid of charge backs. Whats behind this?
EDIT: 2th call to the helpdesk of destinia.com, they said total amounts above EURO 2500,- cannot be paid with Bitcoin (AML policy?). Anyway, so I made two separate bookings and it worked fine.

Then it's quite amassing that Bitcoin has come so far, without major PR campaigns! Must be something about it...

It is the SPAR supermarket close to the central station in Arnhem and they joined the initiative [Arnhem bitcoinstad]( set-up by three Bitcoin enthusiasts. These guys are awesome! btw I was there in the SPAR and payed with bitcoin, they use a tablet that shows a [website]( with a QR code. Was my first bitcoin-visit to Arnhem and I am pretty impressed with the number of shops and bars/restaurants they could convince to accepts bitcoin. Bought some [T-shirts]( [sinterklaas gifts]( and some [healthy food]( I think Arnhem is one of the few cities where you can now almost live entirely on bitcoin! Most shop owners where really excited when we came in and told them we want to pay with bitcoin.

nobody says central bankers cannot manipulate cryptocurrencies. its just they cant do it by printing (unlimited) more...

just was there last week with the same question, here: 
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:53:20


I am not native english speaker, what does he mean with *tumblers* ?
EDIT: Thanks for the response, but still don't exactly know who or what *tumblers* are supposed to mean in the statement.  Someone who makes anonymous transactions?  For example by using mixing service or coinjoin?  Person-to-person transaction?  Or just everyone doing transactions outside exchanges or institutions having KYC or other form of customer registration?

Maybe some localbitcoin.com people in The Hague can hangout there and sell BTC in person, perhaps with a sign 'Bitcoin for sale'?

Yes, not extremely big, but bigger then the ToGo shops you find at trainstations.

in order to receive, your channel needs balance at the other party's side. So you first needs to send payment to someone else or ask someone else to open a channel with you (so there is balance on their side).
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:15:19
jep your balances seems fine to receive, just wondering: could you post an invoice for a few satoshi's so someone can try to pay it? (one with a long expiration time)
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:18:26
first one (2 sat) failed because I cannot set the &lt;maxfeepercent&gt; higher then 100% in c-lightning, the other two invoices where payed successful via 3-hop and 5-hop.
@_date: 2016-12-17 08:29:46
which BIP do you refer to?
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:03:14
if exchanges start using LN payment channels, that reduces counterparty risk for traders (which are normally reluctant to keep many BTC on exchanges) and thus more BTC liquidity on exchanges, which should lower or at least smoothen the BTC exchange rate

Isn't the entire design of Trezor one open source? So what is the issue here? except that Satoshilabs making less money
EDIT: Yes I agree you can copy the design/firmware, but not the cover/logo suggesting it's made by satoshilabs

You don't have to pay fees to (self)validate the system, you only have to run a full node. You do have to pay fees for the validation by miners and all full nodes of the system as a whole. It sounds a bit you claim that rising fees result in a reduced user base, but I think the rising fees are a result of the 'increased' user base.
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:46:32
This is why it is important that Bitcoin's (core) system should be able to run on a wide variety of hardware, fabricated/designed in different countries/continents. For example on Raspberry Pi or other RISC cpu's.
