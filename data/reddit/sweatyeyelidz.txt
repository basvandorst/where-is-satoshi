Exactly this. I paid off our 2 car loans recently and cashed out a few tenths of a btc to fund a trip to the rose bowl, it's been longer than my time on earth since my team made it to Pasadena and my wife gave me the green light. Just  like she did when I suggested we stop watching this unmatched journey of bitcoin from the outside  and dive in.

These posts about bitcoin on sale reminds me of the furniture stores that have big "going out of business" sale signs for 2 or 3 years straight.

None specifically. I am just thinking that some of the recent btc investors are more traditional passive investors. So they won't look into the major swings or be aware of them until 9am eastern Monday when nyse opening bell rings. Then they may panicked sell causing another dip. Although I'm often way off when attempting to predict anything. I am too lazy, ignorant, whatever to try and buy individual stocks and time the markets. Especially after missing the dollar general ipo by one day due to forgetting what day of the week it was......

With all the posts this morning I decided to double my hodlings. Can't play with scared $ amirite? Plus it helps that Christmas gifts have already been purchased for 95% of family. May check for another dro when nyse opens

Yes it said saturday. It seems I need to separate myself from coinbase post haste.

Wait...I was charged a nearly 2% fee today on an ach transfer to coinbase. Should I contact them or just eat it and move to gdax (which I'm unaware of the exact process which kept me from buying btc in January..fml)
