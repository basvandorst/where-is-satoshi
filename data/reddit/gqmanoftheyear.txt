Nah, I think I had this same issue. They have a shit process with confirmation. I had to contact customer support.

I still disagree. If you consider the branches of racism and the institutions and policies that stemmed from it, from colonialism and imperialism that saw entire nations and people's lands impoverished and exploited to fatten and enrich white people's and their white societies to institutions like the IMF and World Bank and white/western states forcing Colored nations to "liberalize" their economies. All of this and more has a bigger impact on not only women, but men and children as well and for generations.

I'm on data. Can't click video.

Because your brain was molded to accept the simple by your western propaganda media. Easier to lead sheep like you. And by the way, what I said wasn't even that complicated to understand.

Exactly. Nothing but filthy white/Eurocentric racist scum on this entire site.

I didn't justify it, I said racism is a more important and prevalent issue, which it is. Also, if you study the history of the white/western feminist movement (which have cried about misogyny to get themselves ahead) you would be enlightened enough to know that it is rooted in racism, Blackphobia and even Islamophobia/Orientalism (Middle East, not East Asia to which it is attributed now).

Don't compare misogyny to racism. Racism is a much more important and prevalent issue than misogyny. And history has shown that in many ways.

Sounds like me and my life. Thanks!

"Shithole?" The only shitholes in the world are your filthy western terrorist states. Racism, Blackphobia, Islamophobia, xenophobia, discrimination and hate in your terror states have only become more prevalent, as have white terrorist attacks on PoC and Muslims, your politicians are among the most corrupt in the world, your wealth gap is the worst in the world, your poor are demonized and ignored, your soulless western terror states worship money and materialistic objects, you celebrate evil white rapists and terrorists like Washington, Chruchill, Napoleon, etc. How has this hateful rant not been taken down? Or is it only considered "hate" when people speak truth on whites and white societies?

I put $250 in crypto currency, including $100 in Bitcoin. Today, that $250 is worth $70-total.
