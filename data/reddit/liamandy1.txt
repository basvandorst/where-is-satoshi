As I’m in the uk 
I’d be very interested if there others from the uk that believe in the growth of the crypto market etc etc and Bitcoin 
I’m very new too this world and being 45 I’m trying too learn more (novice ) 
@_date: 2019-03-02 13:28:34
Is it not better to invest in let’s say half a bitcoin at today’s price of £1400 pounds than invest that amount in too stocks and shares etc long term ? 
@_date: 2019-03-30 20:19:57
Ok �� 
@_date: 2019-03-02 17:59:17
Thanks for the reply’s 
For me it’s early days ,but I find it all very addictive plus very fascinating and plus great community to chat too and learn more 
And I agree I only have invested what I can afford to lose . 
@_date: 2019-03-03 10:22:36
I thought bitcoin could be high reward?
And altcoins unless you have loads of money or are lucky too get in early rewards would not be quite so high .Unless your a big invester.
It would be interesting to know what the average wallet has in them fiat wise . For example how many wallets are held by small investors with let’s say £2000 pounds in them 
@_date: 2019-03-02 13:43:52
I do agree I have a lot of faith long term in bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-03-30 09:39:15
In 2140  the world will be a totally different place .Fiat will not exist and there will be one major currency or crypto 
It’s not that long with Mobile phones or the internet being around and how it’s changed people life’s .So in another 120 approx the world will be scary too how we live now good or bad

In terms off the meaning to the moon I read ,,,actually what price do people have in there head that bitcoin could realistically achieve... very curious as I bet it Varys too silly amounts 
@_date: 2019-02-24 19:22:34
I wish it went up 3% every day lol

I’m Barclays U.K. and I’ve had no trouble buying crypto too put in my crypto.com app
Did have wirex but customer support was terrible and the card worked now and then
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:52:49
No he’s 70 
But depends how you mean it 
I’d agree but he doesn’t listen 
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:47:00
Booked my holiday lol 
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:46:47
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:48:36
True that’s the only thing I see compared too banks in the U.K. is definitely customer service in the crypto industry is definitely way behind for it too really become a big player .That does have to change massively as people want too know they can contact someone if there’s a problem...Going on wirex that’s crap I’ve been waiting over 5 days no reply and I’ve read others have the same issues....
It’s not good enough especially when people have a lot of money tied up in these companies 
If it was banks people would kick off massively and it would be in the main papers in the U.K. etc
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:22:09
Explain plz I’m a novice
@_date: 2019-04-07 07:21:26

Bugger if that was my dad using bitcoin 
I’d no I was ether in a dream or on the moon 
My dad still turns his mobile of to save the battery.But then wonders why he gets no calls lol 
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:54:03
I bought at $3.200 ....., the hardest part I think is not buying but it’s knowing when the right time for you is too sale .
Or maybe holdl??
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:05:00
These high predictions etc etc .I actually wonder how many people will still hold 1 bitcoin .when or if it goes over $50.000 
I can’t see that the average joe bloggs wouldn’t of sold .As $50.000 is a lot of money 
So I reckon most normal people would of sold way before bitcoin becomes 6 figures
