So expect big price movements August 1st?

I gave up on those little increments and am now more confident in my purchases. When I see a drop like this I don't think "Oh my total invesment is down X right now" as much as "Nice, more coin at 'bargain' prices!"

This had me in stitches!

Well, I bought 3.5BTC @ $624. When the price was nearing $300 I was browsing some Bitnews sites and saw an ad for PrimeDice. Feeling bad about my investment being down approx $1000 i started gambling and accidentally bet 2.3 BTC instead of .23 BTC. I obviously lost and now only have .96BTC to my name.
Trust me. You can't possibly feel as stupid as I do. I didn't loose money just because the market drove the price down. I lost money because I'm a gambling idiot. So keep your head up! At least you'll get your money back when the price rises!

Yeah, he really should have bought those hot dogs...

Yeah let's discourage people from asking for advice on the biggest Bitcoin community/discussion board that exists.

I hope it goes down to $200 one last time before the moon so I snag a few on the cheap.

You're absolutely right. In reality I paid $900 to quit gambling and that was an investment I would make again in a heartbeat.

Xapo wants WAYYY too much information from me to start an account. Fuck that. I already have a coinbase account.
