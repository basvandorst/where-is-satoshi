Dude calm down
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:16:43
I was gonna say this. I'm sorry, but the picture in ops post is retarded. What happened to bitcoin? Going this route makes it so un-user friendly. People don't care about decentralization.

Apparently mass down voting is sociopathic? Its annoying but I wouldn't say that it goes hand in hand with killing small animals.

Right.. So 35% of the american population is on welfare, and while that is a really high number, it does have some reasons associated with it (crash, inflation). I don't think you understand medicare (see here:  or social security (see here:  as those are both benefits established for people who can't work (elderly,disabled, etc). As far as the education bit goes, our population has been continually growing more and more educated for the past 80ish years (see here: 


How does that constitute the ability to be successful? My old boss used to watch fox news every day, and he's a self-made millionaire who built his business from the ground up. Also, the government became "Ebola management handlers" when they founded the CDC (center of disease control), so there's that.


Your implying that this is somehow the best solution? That your solution is the responsible and adult solution? That's so incredibly delusional and pretentious it blows my mind. Where does the money come from to institutionalize a health organization? They don't need to provide a high quality product, because people need to fly and where are you going to leave to as a customer? You can't go out and get a pilots license and a Cessna for the price that you can get a flight from California to Florida. And sue for what? "I got Ebola on your plane." "That's too bad, we didn't know someone with Ebola was on our plane."


Right. We're asking the CDC to take care of disease because as an average citizen I don't have a degree in biology, and I don't have the time to figure out how Ebola works, so I pay my taxes and expect the CDC to handle it. Are you seriously comparing the DMV to every government institution? Are you fucking kidding? I guess we should shut down NASA then too because clearly any government department is staffed with entry-level workers who don't give a fuck because that's how the DMV is.


Jesus fucking holy shit. How are you this delusional? I would label you as the exact mindset of a politician, you think you're gods gift to mankind and you just can't understand why everyone else is so stupid. *Mankind has existed for thousands and thousands of years through conditions entirely worse*. Energy crisis? We are increasingly shifting to clean energy solutions. A global pandemic? Such a good example of how Ebola is overblown. Turn off the news and fucking read. Ebola has existed for years, its been contained before and we moved on. Ebola is only contagious when showing symptoms, which makes it much easier to contain. Media hype is for fear, fear sells. We have no "global war". We are not at war, we choose to have our troops in a dangerous area. We choose to do preemptive homeland security. Dwindling resources? Yeah, maybe fossils fuels but we are progressing towards a future where they will be exponentially less used. The only legitimate fear there is the financial crisis, which wouldn't kill the human race. Humanity will have its rough spots, but we aren't fucking turkeys. We won't look into the sky and drown in the rain, because we aren't fucking stupid. Please, please stop thinking you're some sort of elite human, because you aren't. You'll realize that more as you grow up.

I'm actually referencing the end of your comment, sorry I wasn't clear.
What is the early days for you? I've been a miner since the start, and the bitcoin community has always been somewhat stuck up and derrogitory. Its not money that makes people assholes, its the superiority complex coming from the feeling of knowing "more".
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:19:09
I'm pretty sure you're being sarcastic, right?
@_date: 2014-05-04 17:30:23
I feel like the same can be said about the bitcoin sub reddit as well.
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:06:09
I don't agree with what you say(anyone can get something from agonizing others) but as a heads up I'm not the one who downvoted you.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:51:27
It must be hard being you..

Doesnt sound right, cryptsy support is super helpful.

@_date: 2014-04-23 23:38:31
I'm not, but I know people who used to enjoy fucking with people. I think it can be an insecurity/power thing, but I definitely get what you're saying.
@_date: 2014-04-24 12:47:38
Psychopathic not sociopathic (according to the study), just wanted to point that out because there's a difference between the two. I wish I could read the paper past the paywall, but from the way they worded the summary, they say trolling is linked to sadism, which I agree. Along with that, I think sadism can be a symptom rather than a characteristic. I wouldn't say all trolls are psychopaths, but I'm sure some of them are. From what I see, most of them are just weak, angry, and insecure in real life, so they take it out on people through they internet, which makes them feel a power or control they don't get in real life. 
That's just my take on it all though, sorry if its worded a bit weird, I'm up incredibly early for work.

Jobs took pride in stealing ideas, but sued when others took his. Jobs was good at marketing, and seeing good ideas before anyone else could see them. Thats it. He was in it for the money and he was a shit person. If you think otherwise, youre a testimony to apples genius marketing.
@_date: 2014-10-18 13:02:21
See, this is the mindset of the politician, that you're some sort of special breed. You aren't, and *most* people can take care of themselves.
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:05:39
Once again, your opinion does not represent the group. 
I personally think you're being the moron.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:41:11
Here's the thing, bitcoin became a cult and a lot of these people here became somewhat of elitists. Dogecoin is all about friendliness and fun, which really in the end is more appealing
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:42:41

How are you typing?
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:10:15
While your comment is kinda insane sounding in itself, I agree. No one really talks about bitcoin in a sense of a currency, its now more of a get rich quick investment. All happened within the past month or so when bitcoin flew through the roof and this subreddit was flooded by people looking to get rich quick.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:37:00
..did you read the article?
@_date: 2013-09-26 19:47:04
I don't think I'm mixed up on terminology, but why do you say that? Maybe I am. Also how could you abuse the blockchain? And how could you use the average Joe for nefarious purposes besides a botnet for mining bitcoins? 
Private company interest is great, but at the same time there's consistently less and less profit involved in bitcoin mining - even for big companies. I think that if anyone could abuse it, it would be big companies. It seems like you would want to keep bitcoin somewhat in the hands of the people.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:50:20
Seriously, its a currency, not an investment. To succeed is to spend it, not to convert it to USD and leave.

I know, I was there too.
nice username by the way.

Why is it impossible?

It doesn't, everyone is just doing it for fun.

Dude, the government spys on us, bullies companies for SSL root keys, etc. I don't think they give a shit at this point

But.. 1337 isn't geek or nerdy.. Its what 12 year olds thought was cool in like 2001..
And... bazinga.. Jesus Christ
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:51:30
This is so untrue it hurts me
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:54:25
Wow who knew you could write such a complex piece of software with a one line function!
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:56:48
But that's more of a tribute to those times, it doesn't make him "truly geek"-y and I doubt he uses the word bazinga.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:27:36
Really dude?
@_date: 2013-10-04 13:13:46
No, it was a way for kids to type in a language that their parents didn't know about so they could have drugs and do sex with each other!!
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:58:58
It was more of just an attack on the bazinga. But we were all 12 playing counterstrike back then so I don't mind the tribute.
I'm just saying nobody actually thinks 1337 is cool now, sorry to be a buzz kill.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:44:07
Yeah, I really don't get why we still take the govs word on things. They flat out lied to us, and we know that now. They spy on our communication and are quite brutal on peaceful issues, they could lie about this just as easily as anything else.
@_date: 2013-09-15 18:28:56
Why did you sign up just to defend bfl?

How does mining and modifying the blockchain have anything in common? Mining is just sending and receiving information, you aren't modifying any info.
@_date: 2013-09-25 23:25:24
Well I can see that bitcoin mining for the average Joe is out
@_date: 2013-10-03 00:24:12
My brothers isn't getting paid out there

What about the military?
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:42:04
Its so mind boggling that it doesn't sound right. This guy orchestrated one of the biggest drug trades online, there's no way that this is all true.
@_date: 2013-09-26 16:48:48
Why do they need security besides an encrypted wallet? It's not like when you mine bitcoin your tapping into some ultra powerful magical computer force, your computer is just trying to solve a puzzle.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:38:44
This sounds nothing like DPR.
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:57:34
Uhh.. It *is* a currency. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:39:36
But in person, and with even more violence!
@_date: 2013-09-25 18:27:46
But there's no lasting value, the difficulty will go up before you can make your money back. Its a loss in the end.
