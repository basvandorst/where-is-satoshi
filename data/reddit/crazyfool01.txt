Scammer doesn't even know anything about his job!!!
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:45:42
Ops sry!
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:23:33
Thanks friend! Have a good one!
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:18:15
You're welcome :D Have a good one!
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:32:19
With the help of friends =)

BitDefender is great (including the free version). And you're right about the AV using less system resources!
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:25:09
Most trading apps, software, brokers and companies have demo accounts... this is pretty basic info!
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:09:13
It seems you are very new to this and you need to do massive amounts of research to understand the game. If you could "intuitively predict" the price without any understanding or analysis, everyone would be doing that. 
I recommend between 3-6 months of reading and practise on a demo account. If not, start preparing for some serious losses!
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:16:35
Wow what a disaster... keeping such a large amount all in one place is so risky :( 
@_date: 2017-02-18 02:50:25
And also its the weekend :( Hopefully someone with experience in such matters will give some advice on how to deal with this situation. Idiotic scammers. Need to visit the bank and make an appointment with the manager. Collect all evidence and have it ready when you meet. A bit surprising that LBC don't want to do anything. Also file a police report saying you want to report fraud.
@_date: 2017-02-18 00:33:05
This is so sad to hear. Contact LBC asap and speak with all banks and companies involved, starting with your bank. Do not let them complete reversing the payment without letting you provide relevant evidence and investigating thoroughly. If the accounts were hacked or whatever, it means that the person/bank did not have enough security in place and its not your fault.

They will give you a link to a fake bitcoin "exchange" and ask you to log in or something. But to "access" the website, you will need to confirm that you are not a robot by sending a small amount of bitcoin. That will be the end of that.
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:16:59
These terminals support English too... you can see 'Touch the screen to start" =)
@_date: 2018-10-25 07:10:50
Should be more helpful to visitors. However, consider adding the text "here is a two minute video" before the video as it needs a quick intro what's it about. 
Also the big block of text below the video explaining the steps could be made into bullet points and streamlined.
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:04:05
Yup, very risky :( Can encourage crime of opportunity :( 
@_date: 2018-10-25 03:32:53
Cool idea! Many people do such but using real greeting cards and custom paper wallets. Having an electronic version of such action can be beneficial to people who want to introduce others to btc who are far away.
PS. I think you need to prepare an optional note or text (or link/QR) that briefly introduces btc or takes to a page with resources. Guess many would like to add that, especially those who are not good in explaining. Could be a $1 paid add-on haha!
PS. You need to enable delayed gifts (or at least email reminder to make a gift).
Edit: PS. Video of how it works is pretty good, but could be on main page too in the "how it works" section. Pretty easy to understand the process.
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:12:36
Reported to the company hosting the website and it will be taken down ASAP
@_date: 2018-10-28 12:47:03
Come on man no need to be so outraged! You know very well exactly what's going on here :) People are loosing millions to scams, especially the elderly and this is just another one of those small filters created to protect people from themselves! If you'd get defrauded, you'd be the first to go on social media to complain that the bank should have done a better job!
"Paying for building work" is a very common way to rip-off the elderly... fake "builders" charge crazy prices to do small basic jobs. You know very well what other options like "Request by phone" could be related too as well!
@_date: 2018-10-25 04:41:51
Yes, the video could be below the text in "how it works", as until I found the video in the demo section, I wasn't really clear about what's going on. Something to think about!
Yup, email reminders could be useful... you're right about no need for spending btc beforehand!
Educational content is something to really consider... believe me there are people who are VERY BAD at explaining!
@_date: 2018-06-16 18:27:36
Both ways ��
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:54:04
Actually, I must say, its not really easy for small businesses. Seems like a loosing battle vs web hosts, developers and btc payment gateways. You either give them everything, including you DNA samples for KYC verifications, or know how to code a bit. Disaster! 
@_date: 2019-02-19 13:07:13
no effect tried several times in the past!
@_date: 2019-02-02 11:17:19
There are many more... have tried several times to get some of them blocked in the past... reported, e-mailed hosts, etc. nothing works! 
Key is to be careful and spend 10 seconds to double check... QR, addresses, whatever!
@_date: 2019-02-19 13:04:07
There are many such sites. There were many such posts on here about them. Its very difficult to get these closed - I've tried. Emailed hosts, providers, etc. no effect.
The only thing you can do is spend 10 seconds to double check everything... QRs, address, EVEN WHEN using trusted websites!
@_date: 2019-04-16 12:25:26
Very nice! About time!!!
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:10:20
 SCREENSHOTS ARE DIFFERENT? CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN?
@_date: 2016-09-28 12:47:04
Just above the big light blue donation amounts (Other ways to give, including electronic funds transfer can be found here.)

How did you conduct the sale? Steam? Email? Skype? in-game call/chat? May be you can search for him in other ways? We all feel sad for you :| 
@_date: 2016-09-21 10:39:00
protonmail ftw ;))
@_date: 2016-09-28 13:39:41
Do a bit of reading on bitcoin mining first. If you want to play around a bit, there are easier/cheaper ways. If you plan to test for getting some money then forget about it. You will understand why if you read a bit. Better just buy and hold or hodl.  
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:38:59
Upvoted, kind redditor! 
@_date: 2018-11-10 11:03:56
@_date: 2016-09-28 14:48:36
What are you trying to accomplish? Do you just want to learn the process or experiment with it to get a deeper understanding of mining? Or do you want to mine to earn money? CPU/GPU miners can no longer be used to mine bitcoins. Those days are over (years ago). Unless you have serious mining equipment worth a couple of thousands, you will not even collect bitcoin dust once you deduct all investments/electricity. $300-500 USD can be used much more effectively in other ways.
@_date: 2016-09-21 10:51:41
I think you can write something like "choose your game" next to the three types of games to make it more obvious. 
@_date: 2016-09-29 16:31:15
This is the biggest problem when doing something new. You can get scammed a million ways. If he confirmed on chat that he sent the coins, I think its worth properly discussing with Steam rep about what happened. They might even have the logs with them for a few days. May be even IP addresses or some info like email. I think you should try and discuss with Steam, you have nothing to loose.    
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:26:49
My cat fell asleep on a newspaper page that had an small article about Bitcoin (out of all things in the room) and so it would be silly not to believe in Bitcoin after that! 
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:52:50
Nice website... For some reason currency is not changing to GBP or EUR (mobile &amp; desktop). The $ sign next to the price is $AUD or USD?
@_date: 2016-10-21 20:48:52
Damn, we are all very sorry about your loss of Bitcoins. Maybe you can post other information here as well? Transaction IDs, Addresses, etc. for enthusiasts to analyse?
Also do you remember where did you download your Sonarr thing from? Its very interesting to know what has happened. 
@_date: 2016-10-30 22:34:00
Most likely you clicked on a fake link or mistyped the address in the address bar which took you to a fake website that stole your details and coins. Or you may have a malware on your computer :( Bank accounts and Paypal are all attacked in similar ways... unfortunately a lot of thieves are out there :(
You should have enabled more security for your account, 2FA or at least enabled getting an email with the code. 
Hopefully it was not a lot of coins. You could also paste the addresses for enthusiasts to see.
@_date: 2016-10-30 22:44:18
Damn, checked the link... so sad.... there are constant reports and posts here on reddit about these websites and issues. So sad. Always check and double check :(
@_date: 2016-10-30 22:54:35
Yeah, many many many similar cases discussed and reported all the time here. 
Anyone reading this use this to report the website -

What a silly post, so out of proportion =] 
Do you protest about drugs bought with USD, EUR, AUD, GBP and other global currencies too or only bitcoin? 
Market capital of bitcoin is $30B, meanwhile market capital of USD is $10+ trillion. Lets say jokingly 1% of USD is used to buy drugs... even this 1% is already way more than entire bitcoin market capital. Now change that 1% number to something more realistic and also include other currencies and think about that for a second. In fact, bitcoin is a drop in the ocean if you want to compare real numbers of which monies are used to buy drugs or other crimes, so you can't really say that "bitcoin is for drug social degenerate addicts bla bla". You should really be saying USD, EUR, GBP, AUD and other global currencies "is for drug social degenerate addicts and so on". 
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:28:02
Have you tried selecting the imported addressed in the "send bitcoins" menu?
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:09:58
Will offer you some straightforward and brutal advice. You can either forget about this idea now or you can learn the hard way - the choice is yours.
Don't waste your 0.11btc!

Here is one (much prettier :D) in Slovakia  Total fee + spread came to just 50 Euro more than the market price!!

Something on Instagram on the topic of bitcoin activism  
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:25:51
Man, people are trying to help you out so that you DON'T LOOSE money... what else could be a more selfless and loving act? Really man!
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:48:06
Concept is good but sooner or later you will need a system or some checklists to vet the projects or you will have hundreds of fakes, scammers a lot of spam.  
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:07:17
This is one of the cool things for BTC fans (or traders)
