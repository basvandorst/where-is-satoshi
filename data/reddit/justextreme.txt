Bitcoin (BTC) is a fiat currency. But there's an interesting aspect of BTC that makes it different from what we normally think of when we hear this term.
First, here's a definition of the term: "Currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material that the money is made of." (source: Fiat Money Definition | Investopedia).
Although Bitcoin is not governed by national government or law in the traditional sense (like the US dollar in the United States), the technical properties of BTC - like the supply - is governed by the network of Bitcoin-operators (miners) who agree to use the same algorithm. For example, if a sufficient majority of the operators agree to change the supply of BTC from 21 million to 21 trillion, then it will happen.
For a contemporary example, look at Ethereum: The Ethereum Soft Fork Has Been Adopted by Major Mining Pools. “Mining pools” are perhaps simply the new governors of an alternative currency: Public governance of central banks: an approach from new institutional economics.
Legal jurisdiction is another matter. Few national jurisdictions legally recognize BTC as a form of legal tender. That said, if two counterparties share a legal agreement that treats BTC as legal tender for transactions between those counterparties, then BTC as tender should be able to stand up in court.
