Ok, this helps a lot. Personally, I don't think that you are far off. Our rights are getting eroded faster than ever before. I'm admittedly ignorant about Bitcoin but our Constitutional Rights as citizens being trampled on really gets me going. I hate that we are a country of sheep.

Thanks for that clarification. I understand your point (and it's not a small one) but addressing the original post, the prospect of stripping a person of their assets on mere "suspicion" is a gross injustice. At minimum this should be done at an arraignment after the suspect is formally charged. Anything short of this should be an absolutely terrifying prospect to every citizen in the United States. 
I know that there were a number of cases (especially before DNA technology was available) where people were wrongly found guilty and imprisoned. It sickens me to think of how these people were robbed of their very lives. Fortunately with forensics today, theoretically anyway, the proof has to be there to be able to hold up through the initial trial and the subsequent appeals process that will surely come if the suspect is found guilty. 
I'm certainly not blind to the problems of the judicial system though. Here's an [ugly example](

I can't understand how this relates to the way the justice system (as I understand it) works. Following your logic, if I am a person of means (with the financial ability to flee) and my DNA is found at a murder scene, are you saying that my bank account and assets would be seized before I am indicted (or using the Executive Order's threshold of just being "suspected")?

Thanks. I will check this out. Maybe it will be some sort of glimmer of hope in it. Presently, with the way lobbyist carry the lawmakers around in their pockets like their car keys, the chances that individual citizens ever getting the chance to drive seems very a slim prospect.

But what about "innocent until proven guilty"?
