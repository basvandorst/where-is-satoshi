Im not sure what features this gives that you couldnt get by making your own wallet and QR code, photoshopping a fundraiser title on top of the QR code, and uploading to imgur.  
But rushwalltet certainly looks very streamlined and easy to use.  The mouse movement for random input in pretty neat.

EDIT: And this made up number I am quoteing ($300,000,000 USD into BTC) is way way way more than enough to overpower pirate... even 1 or 2 million USD would overpower the whole BTC market right now...

Bitcoin is not fiat.... you even explained it yourself but came to the wrong conclusion.
"The term "fiat" is Latin for let it be done: it designates systems where an entity (eg the Federal Reserve) summons new money into existence by saying, in a god-like way, "let it be done". In the case of Bitcoin new "coins" are brought into existence across the network by the algorithms in the protocol."
If new bitcoins are brought into existence by a protocol... that is the opposite of being brought into existence by an entity (eg the Fed).
EDIT: I suppose I see your point... this paragraph helped:
"In short, bitcoins are created through a transparent and distributed process determined by mathematics. Bitcoin is finite post-Westphalian fiat, a monetary system where currency is indeed created, but through an algorithm driven by the logic of the network of distributed - rather than concentrated - power.  "

@_date: 2015-10-08 16:06:40
Other way around.
BTC is hoarded because it is the unvalued money.  USD (for example) is spent because it is overvalued.

**FROM OU TO BITCOIN AND BEYOND** *By John Turk*
**Tony Sakich, SBA '09,** feels it's better to prepare for the future than to fight it.  That's why, just last year, he signed on as a digital marketing manager with digital currency bitcoin processor BitPay and recently took another job at a start-up that's so cutting-edge it hasn't officially launched.
To understand how advanced the 30-year old Warren, Mich., native really is, you need to understand blockchain technology and how it's used to transfer bitcoin, a form of public digital currency maintained by its users rather than the government.
Bitcoin is processed through a decentralized ledger called the blockchain that records every transaction on the Bitcoin network, through which every transfer of funds needs to be verified before the next transaction can happen.  The technology has received a lot of media attention since it was introduced in 2009, both positive and negative.  Confused?  Imaging ???ching that every day.
It was Sakich's job at BitPay - based in Atlanta, GA., where he now lives - to explain this to anyone who would ask, create digital marketing campaigns for the bitcoin processor and more.  "Sometimes it's like what it would be like explaining the Internet to someone in 1993.  They'd look like a deer in headlights."
In his short time at the currency distributor, Sakich saw clients such as Warner Bros. Records, rapper 50 Cent, Microsoft and more sign on to start making transactions with bitcoin.  He also launched the most successful social media campaign for the currency and the NCAA Bitcoin Bowl in St. Petersburg, Fla., working with online money distributer ChangeTip to hand out $10,000 in bitcoins to Twitter users who used the hashtag 
He loved the energy at BitPay, he says, but has since transitioned to a role with tech start-up Augur - another open-source, decentralized platform dealing with prediction markets.  What that technology could affect at a base level remains to be seen, as it is so new, Augur's formal business plan hasn't been made public yet.  The company hopes to unveil a beta version of its product within the next few months, according to its website.
Sakich said he's able to understand such high-level concepts thanks to the teaching strategies of several of his instructors at OU, including his former marketing instructor Larry Schramm.  "They really went out of their way to give you the real world application of whatever they were teaching," he says.
Schramm, someone with a breadth of real-world experience, teaching marketing classes ranging from the introductory to graduate levels.  He remembers Sakich's determination to fully grasp concepts in his classes by constantly asking questions.
"Some students probably ended up rolling their eyes back because of the dialog, but I liked the interaction," says Schramm, a former General Motors employee for 35 years.  "Tony is just not intimidated by much.  He's one of those people you remember."
What's ahead for Sakich with Augur is nothing short of building a brand from scratch, he says, "This is something that was built on a technology even more sophisticated than bitcoin.  It's scary in a great way, and I'll get to work with really smart people and learn a lot."
As Sakich says, better to be prepared.

Not necessarily, a rising tide lifts all boats.  There is still a huge arb play here.  People can buy on other exchanges and sell on Gox for a 20% profit.  
I recon the % difference between gox and other exchanges represents the market's prediction that gox will fail.  Currently the market thinks there is a 20% chance that gox will fail.  If you think there is less than a 20% chance that gox will fail you should be performing arbitrage right now.
The arb play is what is keeping the other exchanges following gox.  I expect once the difference becomes larger than 50% the amount of arb will go down significantly.
Or simply buy on gox and hold...

You lose your account balance.
The part that btc.sx claims to cover would be the part that would put your account balance in the negative.
* You have $100 in your account.  
* This lets you borrow $100 times x (not sure what the margin limit is here... but lets says you are able to borrow $500).  
* You take the $500 go long on BTC.
* Market price goes down.
* Once your $500 long position has a potential loss of $100 the position is automatically sold in order to prevent btc.sx from losing money.
* If your position is automatcally closed after $101 dollars of loss, than $100 would come from your account balance and $1 would come from btc.sx
* I believe in the 'real world' your account balance would go negative and the broker could sue to recover those funds.

This is the same non existent Bit Instant card that would be ready in 4 weeks back in 2012...  
Pumping with vaporware... Classy.

I guess I have given up on following BitInstant news in the last few weeks/months.

I have been following BTC for a while and I have to say this is the best BTC related story I have ever seen.
Go BTC and Go bitcoinbillionaire!

What is the easiest way to go from fiat cash in hand to BTC without 'verifying' my account or identity?
Other than a good local bitcoins connection?
EDIT: In murica

So do I need an account at every exchange I want to trade on through TruCoin?  In addition to my TruCoin account?
I was hoping to just fund the TruCoin account and trade across the exchanges without having accounts everywhere.
