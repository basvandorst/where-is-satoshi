hacks have happened for tens of millions. they will happen again. bitcoin won't be rolled back.   
if double-spend vulnerability was discovered in the bitcoin protocol (not wallets), then it would be rolled back, most likely. roll-backs risk a fork of the network of course, so there need be consensus.

Almost everyone has an exit strategy.  If a bull run is expected, the sellers are going to start setting their orders. It makes sense.
Importantly, we don't get to see the dollar deposits being sent to the exchanges; We only see BTC deposits. So there is a bias in what gets reported.   
That said, this investigative journalism makes a good pretense for a sell-off. We'll see if the bulls believe it; We'll see if they're scared.

Big money dictates prices whether you regulate them or not. Regulation is Security Theater for the economically and financially ignorant.  
If you lost money during these games played by day traders, that's only because you didn't understand how this market works, and didn't understand the scale of the volatility that big money can cause.  The only real people who lost are those who either stupidly went all-in at a certain price, or those who used 10x plus leverage to speculate on short-term price direction.    
Yes, the smaller the size of the market (bitcoin market cap is 135 billion, compared to gold for example which is 7 trillion), the more short-term price impact any 1 player can have. Learn that lesson. 
You have no right to stable market prices. Do you even know what a market price is? It's merely a reflection of the last recorded price paid between 2 consenting adults.  There's no force involved. You have no guarantees that the next 2 people who trade will trade for more or less money.  Your ignorance of the markets will make you lose money, and no amount of regulation will fix that.

Yes money is created from nothing. But the value of that token is determined by each participant and each stakeholder in the market.    
Value is subjective, but money is an objective technology used to transmit subjective values between individuals.  Markets are real, and tokens are real, and so to the extent that a token can be exchanged for value in a market, that token can be called real money.

That's pretty cynical. The media is made by people.  When people discover something that's new, they, even you perhaps, are initially mystified and exuberant. That's a natural reaction to a brand new, and paradigm-shifting idea.    
It doesn't mean it was fake, or that you were manipulated by nefarious actors.  That's just you refusing to take responsibility for your own emotional reaction, and instead projecting it on others as if it's they who fooled you, and not you who fooled yourself.    
The truth is, the big money, the smart money, is much less emotional than you are; and much less emotional than the media.

But sometimes bullish momentum won't let a predicted drop happen, whether for unforeseen events, or just because a couple whales decided to buy for their own personal reasons.

Also, on a side note, "bitcoin dot com" is not really a bitcoin website. It's not exactly a scam either (and is **not** the reason for your loss), but it's intentionally deceitful and sells a fake version of bitcoin as the real version, and tries to get people to buy it instead of bitcoin.

Can't predict. Engineers are working constantly on these scaling issues.  The number of miners mining will adjust to the fees that can be divided among them. Nobody knows the minimum hashpower to secure the network, or the minimum fee a miner will accept, but we certainly aren't at the minimum now.    
If on-chain becomes expensive, then certainly there will be 2nd layers to accommodate.  So then why worry?

"incentivizing spending" isn't a social good.   
People, when left to their own decisions, show no great interest in, no inclination, no *incentive* to incentivize spending. People spend when there is something *good* to spend on, when they *need* to spend, when spending results in *growth* (not malignancy),  when it's good for them, and therefore *good for everyone* around them.    
So then why incentivize *spending* in the abstract, as if spending isn't **just a sign** of good, but **as if spending is the good in and of itself**?  Why stimulate just to stimulate, when it means taking away human free will and self determination? Because to stimulate spending means to punish saving; It means to punish and deny self ownership.   
If you want to stimulate spending the natural way, come up with an idea, get investors, and build it. Create value. Not nominal growth, not fake growth, not paper wealth, but real wealth, growth in the right direction, value, stuff people want and stuff people need.

As a noob, typically you want to start with an open-source mobile wallet as opposed to running a full node, which is a bit more advanced.  It's important you don't get fooled by the term "wallet". Only open-source wallets should be trusted. Coinbase, for instance, claims their app is a "wallet", but it's really no different than a custodial service like a bank account. They hold and censor your bitcoin transactions at will.   
 I recommend Samurai, Electrum, Mycelium.  And if you end up buying a significant amount of bitcoin, absolutely consider buying a hardware wallet to pair with your mobile wallet. This will add a very secure layer of protection.  At the very least, if you hold a lot of value, enable a form of 2FA protection on your mobile wallet.  
Edit: Also remember to backup your wallet seed phrases. It's critical.

Most people were once in the "illiterate" category as well. You don't get freedom without personal responsibility.  
Further, having to pay for the true cost of your individual security, rather than depending on forced taxation (assuming...) will certainly incentive personal responsibility.  People are cowards now because they can afford to be, because costs are socialized.

Exchanges generally don't give you fork coins. Holding your own coins is the way to definitely get them. If you are changing wallets, and aren't sure if you have fork coins available, just make sure you don't throw away your old wallet seeds.  That way you can always go back and check when you figure out how to do it.

1.  Why are you running a full node?

3.  Yes you have to move your bitcoin to an exchange to trade on that exchange.    
4.  I don't know what "deactivate that machine" means, or why you're doing it. But you're free to move bitcoin to any wallet you like. You know what a backup seed is right?
@_date: 2018-09-26 20:25:55
Were they from the same pool? Transaction validation takes time, and the more you include, the higher chance someone else orphans your block. If they found multiple quickly, they were just calculating their risk of being orphaned, and submitting as quickly as they decided was beneficial without risking loss of the block reward.
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:51:33
You can't just come in and make money mining as a noob.  Although, if you want to mine, even though you won't make a profit, then do it.  But I guarantee you won't make a profit unless you have cheap electricity, cheap cooling, and a lot of efficient capital, including intellectual capital, to start.     
However, if you have an actual need for the financial sovereignty that bitcoin provides, then a personal mining setup can be beneficial because it can be made to provide an anonymous source of income, safe from confiscation.  In that case, bitcoin is worth far more than the going market rate to you. Therefore you can operate at a nominal loss, knowing that 100% of your dollars and physical property are susceptible to confiscation and theft.

We haven't tested the lower bound of hash power necessary to secure the network.  We have just been maximizing profit during an exponential growth period. So we've been pushing the upper bounds of hash power. When block reward is gone, we'll test the lower bound.  It will change engineering focus, as long as there remains worries like yours.

Self determination and self-defense go hand in hand. Yes, that the entire population is coddled by the nanny state, and is incapable of defending themselves is a "weakness".  But that's why we have insurance products, custodial services, multi sig methods, hidden wallets, etc.  And that's why everyone should know how to protect themselves, and defend against such attacks, whether it's your bitcoin, your jewelry, or your children. You can't have freedom without personal responsibility.
@_date: 2018-09-20 03:07:52
Buying small amounts is very inefficient. If you want low fee percentages, buy thousands of dollars worth on a major exchange (like Gemini, Kraken, itBit, GDAX) using limit orders.  
Alternatively, coinbase will probably be a little cheaper than your app.

Everyone is manipulating. Nobody knows whose manipulation will dominate, if any. You have no right to pure price signals, and trying to regulate this sort of thing only brings a false sense that your price signals are honest. Order books can be made to look a certain way, trading volume can be made to look a certain way, news media can be made to look a certain way.   
Bitcoin will appreciate in the long run if it is useful and desired; It will depreciate is it's not. The rest is noise. And the guys with the most capital will paint the short term narrative. That's just how markets work.   
Losers cry manipulation because they hate rich people's domination of the markets. And regulation at the point of a gun is how losers try to manipulate the markets. Only it's not helping them like they think it should; That's why they'll always be losers.

$30 wire fee for each exchange, plus 0-.2% trading fee, plus tiny bitcoin mining fee.  So in total, much less than 1%.  However you expose yourself to exchange risk of course, depending on what the market prices do during the time delays.  And if you don't already have exchange accounts ready in each country, you could be adding significant waiting periods or administrative delays.

The same reason people don't like all alt coins. The same reason everyone is selling their shitcoins back for bitcoin.  Because Bitcoin did it already.  They're just posing, pretending. They offer no value. And the size of their market means they are less secure, and offer less liquidity to investors. That means they're worth less simply for the fact they are smaller.  And until a shitcoin comes up with an actual value proposition, it will remain that way.  The market is smarter than you.  Just accept it.

Banks aren't going anywhere. Central banks might get some competition and have their power reduced to a certain extent. But debt, various forms of rehypothecation and large financial institutions are here to stay.  Bitcoin is a choice for those willing to make it, and is a tool to reduce the manipulation power of custodial services and financial instruments it competes with.  Bitcoin won't replace all financial instruments, and so Bitcoin won't replace banks.  
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:27:58
If it becomes necessary for reasons other than bragging, bitcoin will increase its block size. And not a second before then. There is a centralization cost which bitcoin is not willing to pay for increasing block size right now. Bcash is more centralized than bitcoin, plain and simple. And its price reflects its inferiority.  
You know who can do EVEN MORE transactions than bcash? Visa. You're welcome to keep using them.

No. Not quickly and easily like you can on coinbase anyway.
Decentralized exchanges, which offer something close to what you describe (not exactly) are under development, but they have many challenges.  
You have to understand that if you keep custody, then the buyer can't be sure you're going to complete the order. Further, you'll have to transact on the blockchain in order to complete the transaction, which means very slow trading. Traders demand instant order matching, and guaranteed liquidity. If you don't need these things, there are some options for trading of course. You can trade with anyone you want, using any method you like.

Fees are a function of what the users are willing to pay, not of some technical design feature. Bcash offers nothing over bitcoin.  That people are willing to pay a higher fee (if and when btc fees might exceed fees on another network) just means that people value a bitcoin transaction higher than they value a bch transaction.   It means the utility of bitcoin is higher.  Notice fees tend to go up when price goes up; which means investors don't believe the fees are creating an overall negative impact to the network.
BCash isn't being used as much, because bcash isn't valued by people as much.  Miners have to take what they can get.

Yes, they "control" it until they sell it to "manipulate" the price one time. Then someone else "controls" it.   
Nobody ever said bitcoin was trying to "decentralize" wealth.  
Bitcoin is censorship resistant because of it's decentralization. That's why it's decentralized.  Not because of some retarded commie ideal of wealth distribution.   
BTW do you know how much of the US Dollar which is in the custody of banks and government?  So they control the dollar in the same way as you suggest bitcoin is "controlled".    
It's true, rich people control prices in the short term. And always will.

If you're already invested in bitcoin mining to such a degree that you could afford to pull it off, then your incentive isn't really there.  It's a long shot at this point since everyone is hyper aware of the situation. But certainly not a long shot to create major disruption, and a temporary price event.  But bch wouldn't benefit much since it would really make the whole crypto industry look bad.

1. ".dat?" no  
2. private key's are native to bitcoin. universal.  
3. Seed phrases are not necessarily usable across multiple wallet, it's is mixed.  
4.  These are open source projects using publicly available protocols and specifications.  They won't disappear.  And if they do, they can easily be rebuilt at least to the point of extracting private keys, which is all you need to access your bitcoin.  It's a simple algorithm, you just need to find out the specific one for your seed format.

Money is just a commodity essentially. Free markets are a right under natural law ideals. The US Constitution is very much based on natural law, and already covers these things.  What's needed is *not* a new arbitrary declaration regarding something so abstract and incomprehensible as money; What's needed is for the people to stand up against the tyrannical overreach of government and claim the rights to trade freely which god has always made self evident. It's called free will.

Retailers have been resisting for multiple reasons, including:  
1. Confirmation times (from less than 1 minute to maybe hours for a single confirmation, where 3-6 are confirmations are the minimum recommended).  
2. Market volatility. If you think btc price is going down, then you have little motivation to hold it, even for just long enough to sell it on an exchange. There are 3rd party services which automate this process and minimize or eliminate market risk, but there is a fee, which is a disincentive, a cost.  
3. Integration + maintenance/upgrade costs.    
4. Learning curve, education.    
I think  and  are main obstacles. Lightning Network will take care of  But Lightning needs refinement and adoption by the major wallet providers.  Progress is fast, but it still will take months for significant progress IMO.  
As for market volatility, that should theoretically take care of itself to a certain degree if the market cap, liquidity, and velocity all continue to increase. As bitcoin finds it's place in the economy, the perceived stability will at least reduce the kind of trader panic that can happen on an otherwise speculative asset.  I suspect volatility will be both attractive to traders, and unattractive to risk-averse, would-be adopters for a long time to come.

1. Never accept reversible payment methods for large amounts.  Risk management is a part of business.  
2.  Never keep more on LBC than you need for daily transactions.  You can manage a minimum balance with regular deposits and withdrawals.  
3. LBC accounts are regularly bought and sold. Never assume reputation is a guarantee.  Again, risk management.

They give the same exchange rate that every other retailer using this gateway gets. Sometimes its higher than certain exchanges, and sometimes it's lower. It's calculated based on actual market depth at high liquidity exchanges. Considering there's a 2.7% discount for bitcoin, I bet you're getting a fine exchange rate *on average* even if the rate is higher than the current market price at GDAX or bitfinex.    
There's always an efficiency loss (cost) to trading your coins outside of the leading exchange.  That's built into every purchase you make using bitcoin or any other currency.  The more liquid the market, the more efficient the pricing mechanism.  It's why convenience store prices are higher than large outlets.    
By the way, there's an *actual reason* bitcoin is cheaper, especially for fungible commodity purchases like bullion. In these markets, there is higher than usual risk of credit card fraud, because bullion doesn't lose it's value once it leaves the store, like electronics or clothes for example.  Bitcoin can't be reversed.

1. roll a 6 sided dice 99 times.
2. write down each result, writing a "0" for every 6 that comes up.
3. take this long string of numbers from 0-5 and convert it from base 6 to base 10.
   a. This means starting from the first non-zero digit on the left, multiply it by 6 then add it to the next digit, then multiply by 6 then add to the next digit... etc. until you get a long number with digits from 0-9.
4. Now you will have to calculate the public key. This is more easily done if the private key (the long number you made) is in binary form (1 or 0) so convert the number to binary.
5. Use the ECDSA point doubling formula and point addition formula on the generator point to get the public key. This will probably take a few days.
6. Convert the public point's x and y value both into binary. Pad each of them with 0s on the left hand side in case they're shorter than 256.
7. add 00000100 to the far left, then the padded x, then the padded y.
8. follow the video I linked above to perform a single SHA256 on the binary string created in 
9. once you get the single 256 bit binary string... you must then perform the RIPEMD160 hash algorithm on it.
10. once you get the 160 bit length hash from it, add 00000000 to the far left of it... hold this string for later. We will do two things to it.
11. perform a SHA256 on the string from  then perform ANOTHER SHA256 on the result. (double SHA256)
12. take the 32 bits on the far left of the result from  and add it to the far right of the result from 
13. For every 8 zeros on the far left of the result of  write down a number 1 on a piece of paper. Then convert the left over bits to base 58 as per the bitcoin base 58 specification (it's slightly disorienting if you're doing by hand, as 0 is represented by 1, 1 is represented by 2, 57 is represented by z etc...)
14. now you have your bitcoin address. To format your private key in the widely used WIF format, perform  on the binary private key from  except instead of sticking 8 zeroes to the far left, add 10000000 to it instead.

"and not affect the price" is a misconception. There is no such thing as "the price".

Price isn't something you can calculate, or objectively "affect" with a certain amount of money.  You make an offer, and see if anyone takes it.    
Converting billions is not a problem.  The real question is "why" is someone selling that much. If there is a fundamental reason, then the price is moving anyway.  It's impossible to determine how much you moved the price with a certain amount of selling.

Hyperinflation is more a sign of societal collapse, productivity collapse, than of money printing.  Money printing of course doesn't help the lead-up to it, but socialism and authoritarian control of an economy usually cause hyperinflation, simply because there are no products to buy. Hyperinflation could happen with a stable money supply too, if govt came in and prevented businesses from producing or making a profit.  Of course money printing and authoritarian control are highly correlated though.

No. Not exactly. It's a fund that has been setup with a pool of investors who buy bitcoin for the trust. It's designed to track the price to a large degree because the principle investment of the company is bitcoin.  But there are some aspects of the fund that make the prices diverge pretty widely sometimes. It has to do with the timing and mechanics of the investments.  It's an option to get exposed to the bitcoin price, but I would consider futures contracts to be a much better way to closely track bitcoin price.  Futures have 1btc minimum purchase though, and you need extra approval for your brokerage account usually.  Buying actual bitcoin from an exchange is the best option of course.

So what if it becomes illegal in a few countries? You think that will stop Bitcoin globally? They're just excluding themselves. Not that they can enforce it anyway. They would have to shut down VPNs, and keep up with all sorts of easy ways miners could obfuscate their bitcoin activity.  You really can't stop it. You can't stop people from running software privately, and you can't stop the easily hidden bitcoin transactions from propagating on the network.  All they can do is waste a ton of money chasing people.  Bitcoin won't be stopped. You can transmit transactions through radio signals, sms, any conceivable communication channel.

No accounting necessary. No way to distinguish between lost bitcoins and saved bitcoins. No need to counter it either. It's not a problem. The price will go up as supply goes down, assuming demand remains the same.   
As long as there is 1 satoshi, or whatever smallest unit you can imagine, it can be divided practically infinitely into as many parts as is needed to keep the units flowing. The price per unit will auto-adjust to whatever is demanded by the market.

But if you know they're buying back the stocks, then it's priced in.  It's knowledge everyone has.  If the confidence they are claiming (by performing the buy-back) turns out to be false confidence, then the price will react to the downside.   If the investors don't have good reason to trust their confidence, the buy-back won't make the price go up, and might make it go down.
A buy-back is nothing more than an act of confidence about the future results.  Investor sometimes give them the benefit by also trusting their confidence (and by not selling into their buying, by withholding judgement because they have been trustworthy in the past, or for other good reasons). Sometimes, the company's confidence is proven wrong, and investors flee, because they feel ripped off.  *Fool me once*...etc etc.   
Nobody is forcing investors to valuate them higher.  There's this myth that buying always means the price goes up.  No. Sometimes you buy into a dip, and it keeps falling.  Value is subjective, price is decided by individual investors who are constantly being fed new information, and adjusting their values and their bids.  
You have no right to objective pricing models.  So-called manipulation is a fake crime, invented by, and catering to the financially ignorant.  These people who always cry "manipulation!" would have the markets be nothing more than a lottery which everyone has equal chance of winning.  You don't incentivize innovation by preventing people from profiting from good ideas and good information.  It's a losers mentality, and the cause of all govt intervention into markets.

If you're going to DCA, meaning you're going to buy blindly in intervals, then there is no statistical advantage to making it more complex with this laddering technique. Statistically bitcoin has increased over time, so your attempts at catching a lower price will tend to fail over time, leaving you in a smaller position than intended.  Now, if you think the market is going down, and you think you have good information to support that thesis, then yes, maybe some knife-catcher orders could be advantageous vs. just plain DCA intervals.

Bitcoin is a rather simple abstract idea. *Financial sovereignty* is a good way to describe it basically.   
Within that term, censorship resistance, supply security, and sufficient scale are all implied.  And so when those principles are at risk of being violated, stakeholders of *financial sovereignty*, as both an abstract idea, and stakeholders of bitcoin, being the best actual implementation of that *financial sovereignty*, take corrective action.    
The negotiation process in determining the best corrective action can be messy of course, and result in forks as we have seen. Then the forks compete, and the market tends to use the one that provides more utility, more value. Principles are tested. Wash, rinse, repeat.

Economies aren't supposed to just "continue to grow". They expand and contract.  Govt control of the money supply was invented to TRY to put an end to the boom bust cycles. But it has failed.  Economies need to contract, and spending must be reduced when there aren't good things to spend on.  That's life.  Creative destruction.  Spending on shit doesn't improve lives or economies.  
Don't worry though. Your precious debt-based assets aren't going anywhere.  Rehypothecation isn't going anywhere.  Inflationary effects aren't going anywhere.  Bitcoin is merely a tool to fight back against the fantasies and empty promises of central planners.   
Even Bitcoin will have inflationary effects through its inevitable usage in derivatives and financial instruments of all kinds.  The key difference with Bitcoin is that the paper can be turned in for easy delivery and possession of the real asset, with few excuses available to paper-issuing financial custodians.  Bitcoin also offers new methods of reducing or eliminating shady use of fractional reserves in certain aspects the financial industry (not all, but some).

It doesn't mean too much. It's very easy to draw that chart with orders. The actual trades that occur are a better measure of what's going on.  The more you zoom out, in terms of time span, the more meaning it has.  
If the trading volume really picks up, like this graph suggests it should, then you know it's intentional buying support.  The proof is in the volume.  The rest is just posing and flexing.

Transaction prices aren't determined by any sort of math you can do.

Tether is no more useful than dollars, except for a couple of exchange owners who wouldn't have been able to open an cryptocurrency exchange business, because they didn't have banking relationships; Tether offered a way to trade in dollars without banks, essentially outsourcing their banking relationship to the business owners of Tether.  Tether offers no censorship resistance, and no financial sovereignty.    
It's a digital Chuck-E-Cheese token, which can be revoked at any time, and whose value is kept "stable" through a unstable mechanism which has many ways in which it could fail badly.

"Buy in" is a vulgar conformist slogan, and "log on" is boring and bourgeois.  Opt out? Sure. 
 
The 60s was basically a communist uprising. Never trust a naked chick with flowers and big pupils.  These "activists" want full and complete access to your finances. Financial sovereignty, for them, is men wearing top hats and monocles whose money they want to take. 
Bitcoin is more a reaction to the overreach of government that in many ways started in the 60s with the exponential growth of the welfare state, the further loss of the gold standard, and the experimentation of the Keynesians which further accelerated the fleecing of our bank accounts.

Bitcoin doesn't require an increasing number of miners. Market conditions (price and availability of electricity) determine how many miners there are.  It's perfectly sustainable.   
When electricity cost goes up, or bitcoin price is expected to stay low, miners quit. Hashing difficulty adjusts automatically.  It's fine.

lol "seems really respected". how about you analyze his claims and judge for yourself. are you so intellectually hobbled that you can't come up with your own opinion about the supposed-truth he's presenting?  
He's referring to a chart pattern, which he believes has statistical relevance to bitcoin.  Nothing magical happens when the price drops, which prevents price from going higher again later.  The absolute best he can say is that patterns that look similar to this (subjectively, since he doesn't show his formula) have historically resulted in long bear markets, or business failures.  He's comparing it to stocks obviously. And since bitcoin isn't a stock, and isn't a company that can go out of business, then his assumptions really don't apply in the same way.  There is no such threshold. 
Businesses, especially public companies, have thresholds which, once reached, tend to lead to the death of the company.  Bitcoin will continue no matter the price.

specifically, the banks will shut you down if they find out you're using p2p exchanges like LBC, bitquick, paxful, and receive cash deposits from random people.  in other words, if you're running a money transmission business, you'll get shut down eventually.  but wires to exchanges aren't typically a problem.

Juggling isn't hiding anything. You eventually have to spend right? You haven't broken the path, you just made the path turn in different directions. To "mix" you need to receive someone else's bitcoin as an output, otherwise your just wasting fees.
The most benefit you can get from self-mixing is, for example, you could claim in court that you sent them to someone else; And if the court couldn't locate where they went, and couldn't find your wallet, then you might get away with it; That is, until you went to spend it; Then you would have to make sure your spending transaction was anonymous.

There is no requirement for block reward to be 87k. Difficulty is auto-adjusting. Fees will tend toward cost to run the network. Whatever that cost is, plus a little margin for miners, users will pay.  If it's $20 per transaction, which is merely a guess on your behalf, then 2nd layer scaling will pick up the slack.    
This situation is long into the future, and it's impossible to pretend to know how scaling will be addressed by then. Further, it would be wasteful to try and solve it now. Scaling is a moving target. Incremental improvements are happening which you aren't considering.

It's multisig, where one of the devices is allowed to stay offline. You can technically do this already, but the procedure would be complicated because passing the signed transaction to the 2nd device would typically required a network connection for maximum convenience.  This passes the transaction with a qr code instead. Currently, you could pass it using a usb device, but it's a pain. This sounds like a good idea, if implemented well.

Why would miners stop so quickly and in unison? They aren't under that much immediate pressure from price.  We just saw the price go under the supposed "cost to mine", and we didn't see all the miners leave. In fact, the miners just keep coming because there's no reason to panic.  If something catastrophic happens, then an emergency fork is an option.

The blockchain doesn't hold your identity information. Everywhere and everyone else may keep records, and in many cases must keep records.  So you have to know what you're doing to get anonymous bitcoins.    
It's often called pseudo-anonymity. The internet is another example of pseudo-anonymity. If you understand how to be anonymous on the internet, you can probably figure out how to be anonymous on bitcoin.  OPSEC is the key.

Adding mining power doesn't add value per se.  The mining market and the crypto markets are separate for the most part.  Adding hash power to increase coin value is like the tail wagging the dog.  
Put another way, you add mining power because the price goes up or you expect it to (or because you need to compete with other miners to maintain the same income you have been receiving). You don't add mining power to increase the value.

It's more an engineering problem than a monetary incentive problem. By the time mining reward goes to zero, there are going to be plenty of developments regarding how the system will scale.  It's hard to say for sure, but consider the pace of innovation we've seen so far, I doubt it will be an issue.  
Also remember the mining difficulty adjusts to however many miners there are. So if fewer miners want to mine because there is less income to share, then it's not  necessarily a significant worry as long as there are enough miners to secure the network from attack.    
Further, we have already proven Lightning Network can reduce the load on the blockchain.

"$50 in bitcoin" isn't a well defined number. The price of bitcoin varies widely by the second, depending on the source of your pricing quotes.     
Specifically, the prices at Bitcoin ATMs, similar to convenience stores, have prices higher than those you will find at the wholesale markets.
Ask him how much bitcoin he wants. Not how many dollars he wants.  Send him the bitcoin amount.   
If he only quoted you "$50 in bitcoin" as the price, then that's not really a legally binding quote for a specific amount of bitcoin.  You don't legally owe him anything until he quotes you an amount of bitcoin, and you agree to it.

Also, I've posted this next video a bunch, but it serves an important counterpoint to these very valid anti-financialization arguments.  It's important to remember financialization isn't bad; And even it it is, it can't be eliminated. Bitcoin solves some of the bad aspects of financialization by creating a way to hold the actual asset rather than an IOU, if you choose.  But IOUs and financial products aren't going anywhere.  Their power to devalue the underlying asset is reduced by the ultimate ability to easily claim, deliver, and hold the asset in a way never before possible. But Bitcoin will be rehypothecated, and that rehypothecation will have an inflationary effect on the price going forward. It's something to be aware of, even though we can't stop it (though we can push back in some ways Trace mentions in this podcast, when he talks about the use of public keys instead of general accounts for custodians to prevent rehypothecation in some financial services):

The outcome of Nakamoto Consensus is the source, which is outlined in the Bitcoin Whitepaper.  No "official source" for mining reward exists or will ever, except as expressed in validated blocks on the "longest cumulative difficulty" blockchain.  
Anyone can run or enforce any rules they want.  To avoid a network fork, people converge on a single protocol.  A sort of precedent is established, a promise expected to be kept by the current users, investors, stakeholders.  The current rules being expressed in the longest cumulative difficulty valid chain use one of a variety of implementations of bitcoin protocol.  The most notable is the Bitcoin Core project, though there are others.  
You can review the developer resources for the Bitcoin Core project here:

Fees are part of the price you pay for the service that delivers and provides the convenient payment methods for you.  You can't avoid fees for services.

Digital currency has existed for a long time. Digital, as an adjective, doesn't distinguish cryptocurrency from every other currency in the world.
Cryptocurrency is an accurate description because it was created by cryto-anarchists, and is a product of p2p cryptograghy.  If you take that away, it's no different than what we have already.   
All the big advancements in human society have been anarchist in nature.
Your instinct for political correctness is a fascist instinct, meaning it presumes the permanent predominance of the state.  Cryptocurrency is nothing if not a direct reaction to state power and overreach.

Not that it matters much. So-called centralized nodes can't do anything to censor on the network anyway.

If you know the answer, then why do you ask?  Bitmain is incentivized to take as much mining as they can without negatively effecting the price.  The price will only be negatively effected if the market perceives Bitmain to be a threat.  The market hasn't yet seen a significant threat.    
You should also question the source of those scare statistics that are going around. There's no way to know for sure how much dominance they have.  If you are convinced, then make your case; Convince us too. Post some links. Something other than this innuendo.

 Depends on many factors. If your wallet has any non-anonymous coins in it, you're mixing won't help.  If you aren't using a tor-enabled wallet, the mixing will have limited effect.  If you spend the coins in a way that reveals your identity, the mixing won't necessarily help.  Also, mixing will likely result in you having so-called "tainted" coins either way, they just won't be your tainted coins.  
Are you trying to make a purchase on a darknet site? If so, I suggest taking your time and learning as much as you can before doing anything.  r/darknetmarkets has information.  So does r/tor, r/qubes, and r/whonix.   Each darknet market usually suggests a specific mixing service, which can usually be trusted as long as that market is *relatively* trusted. At least that's how it worked when I last knew of such things.  
NOTE: If your "friend" is buying for you, you may taint his account history with the exchange he bought at, and you may jeopardize his relationship with his exchange. Mixing is detectable, whether you can trace the coins or not.  I suggest not getting them from a friend, but trying to obtain them anonymously. Try obtaining bitcoin using cash deposit method at paxful, mycelium localtrader, or bitquick.co, because it's possible to buy small amounts without an ID.  Another method is to find someone at a Bitcoin Meetup group willing to trade without ID.

"The market", as a whole, includes OTC. So of course it affects. What people mean to say is that it doesn't directly take from or give to the liquidity in the public order books.  OTC is just another way of saying private sale.    Now, if a bunch of new bitcoin come onto the public order books on exchanges as a result of the OTC trade, then of course the OTC trade has indirectly had an impact in the state of liquidity on the "public exchanges", which some people conflate with "the market".

Bitpay wallet is a closed source application which they claim is based on the copay wallet project (even though bitpay will lie and tell you that their wallet is "open source", it's only "based" on open source), and which integrates their centralized services.  That a wallet is closed source is all you need to know for the questions 1-3.  Consider it a custodial service like coinbase, or like your traditional bank account, because they are in control of the code, and therefore in control of your bitcoin.    
As for   Forget blockchain.info.   I don't know what you mean "can I use it here". Where?

Lightning is still basically experimental. When you see all the popular open source wallets implement it, like Electrum and Mycelium, Trezor, Ledger, you'll know we've made a serious next-level milestone in scaling.     
Segwit has made a big difference, exactly as it promised.   
There have also been improvements in the practices of wallets and exchanges, like batching and other smaller efficiencies which add up to significant improvement since the last bull run.   Also Liquid is an inter-exchange service that has just gone online, and seeks to mitigate quite a bit of on-chain traffic through its implementation of a sort of federation which shares a smart-contract side-chain for instant transactions between participants. 
So no, it won't be exactly like last time, unless the crowd is bigger this time. But that's actually a problem you want to have. It means there will be more capital spent to continue further improvement.  High fees will fund capital investment because miners, devs, and all stakeholders will be motivated to keep a good thing going.  Innovation is a free market process that needs to go through stages. You can't just skip to the end of network scaling.

"Transferred" means traded? Giving to someone else?  If so, then yes. The cost basis is calculated at the time you purchase. Then when you trade it aka spend it, you calculate like this: (Selling value aka USD value of merchandise purchased)-(cost basis aka price paid originally)=profit or loss.

Fine art, collectibles, metals, even savings accounts, bonds, annuities, and other instruments have been storing value forever. Bitcoin's value proposition is censorship resistance, confiscation resistance, and predictable supply.  I'd say those are significant benefits, but these benefits don't negate any of those other categories.  Bitcoin seems more likely to disrupt the financial industry than the real estate industry, just because of the abstract nature of it.  Real property will always have value.

Depends on the supply and demand dynamics. Low liquidity, or reduced liquidity markets can be volatile up and down.  If the conversion between btc and hublots is perfectly efficient, instantaneous, and universally available, then theoretically they can maintain the same price as the bitcoin market. But depending on the work that is done to convert between one and the other will add price resistance and price premiums between them. Up and down.

Miners aren't removing anything. The mempool can be filled with all sorts of shit. They pick the highest fee. It's not guaranteed to work, but the miners will publish the one with the higher fee most likely.  Nothing is getting un-published.

It sort of depends how narrowly or broadly you define decentralization. Often when people discuss centralization, they mean the centralization of political power, political violence.  But in technology, decentralization can have more of an abstract generalized meaning without the ethical implications.

It's called arbitrage. Usually when there is a significant difference between exchanges that lasts more than a few moments, it's for a structural reason. There is some sort of friction in the transaction. For example, withdrawal limits, delays, or fees, or maybe other account limitations or technical issues on that exchange. That said, some traders focus solely on arbitrage trades and are successful. Just be aware that you're competing with others doing the same thing, and there is a reason for the differences. Making a profit is not as simple as you might think if you're not experienced with these things.

Central banking is a "government entity", whether or not the bank is nominally private. It's like corporatism in Nazi Germany, where there was private ownership, but only on the surface; Below the veil, govt controlled everything.  The free market wouldn't produce The Federal Reserve.

Economic principles are rare among lefties. Financial freedom is also generally resented by liberals who want to be free to steal from you to support their cause of the day.   
Bitcoin is a Declaration of Independence for the ages, because it is very much in following with natural law, anarchy, and principles of human freedom, which are all more closely associated with conservatism than with liberalism these days. The founding fathers used to be considered liberal, but to invoke them now is considered conservative.

If someone gets your bitcoin wallet, they know what you have. Or if you spend your bitcoin somewhere they ID you, then those bitcoin now have a data trail. Your identity isn't in the bitcoin network, but there is extant data, and it is "possible to tell" you owned them.   
It's important to understand the difference between anonymity and pseudo-anonymity.  It is always important not only that the particular system be anonymous per se, but that you interact with that system in an anonymous way.   
As for the coin join, it's not perfect even when implemented well. It should be considered a light measure of privacy for now at least. Wasabi's implementation is pretty new.

It's not an illusion. Debt based instruments, and other forms of fiat will never be completely eradicated. It's the basis of the entire financial industry.  Whether the dollar dies or not is more a question of whether the nation state remains. Rehypothecation, fractional reserve, debt certificates, money printing, these things aren't going anywhere. Bitcoin aims to gain some leverage over these things, but it cannot eliminate them; At least not unless you imagine some kind of horrible totalitarian regime to enforce it.

Not necessarily. There's a notion of market equilibrium you should study.  Another scenario is that fewer miners would be competing for blocks.  We don't need the number of miners to stay this high, or keep going up with the scale of the network.

It's weird how you can say there is a mining centralization "problem", but without any empirical evidence showing censorship resistance being even close to being threatened.   
The market will speak loudly when there is a threat. The market balances itself.  And the market will create the incentives to fix the problem in the most obvious currently available ways. That being: Move pools if you think the network will benefit from it.      
New miners won't come on board unless they think the price will go up.  If new miners think creating a new pool, or moving their resources to another pool would be more profitable, they'll do it.  Don't underestimate the wisdom of smart money.  
Your solution is very complex.  Wait for the problem to emerge. Censorship resistance is the end goal; not abstract decentralization for its own sake.
It's a neat idea though.

But *gold* has been commodity money for 1000s of years with a relatively stable purchasing power.  Bitcoin's future purchasing power is less known, less proven than gold.    
Further, Bitcoin is far more *deflationary* than gold, in the sense that it's supply cap of *21 million* will constantly and *slowly be reduced over time* because of the inevitability of people losing their private keys.  *Gold's supply cap is unknown*, except as theorized by Big Bang universe theory, which suggests there is plenty more gold in the universe than we can even conceive of mining.  *Mining costs limit the supply of gold, but do not limit the supply* **cap** *of gold*, as is the case with Bitcoin.

Forget indicators. Just follow prices and volumes, and maybe the basic 12-period EMA. As for time-frames, use them all.    
If you just look at a daily chart, and look at volumes, you'll notice the price has bounced from the bottom, but the amount of volume during the move isn't very significant in the grand scheme.  
There's some reason to think the trend is changing, but there's not a ton of reason because there is not a ton of volume.   
You're not going to find much use with MACD if you don't understand the basics. Most noobs cripple themselves with indicators.  It's tarrot cards when it's misused.

* Metcalfe's law states the effect of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). First formulated in this form by George Gilder in 1993,[1] and attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet, Metcalfe's law was originally presented, c. 1980, not in terms of users, but rather of "compatible communicating devices" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc.).[2] Only later with the globalization of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections.[3] The law is also very much related to economics and business management, especially with competitive companies looking to merge with one another.  src.     
Comment: This law is used to try to argue that money needs to be used to be valuable. The fallacy hidden within this argument is the suggestion that saving and storing money isn't USING money. That's false. Price and value have external and subjective aspects which are ignored here. Gold would still be valuable if nobody transacted with it.  Yes activity on the network increases the value, but the extent to which that makes up the entire value of the currency is not well defined or understood.
* Gresham's Law is so misused and misinterpreted, it's ridiculous. It merely says people will spend their shitty currency before they spend their good currency. So? Again the writer is pushing the fallacy that bitcoin needs to be "used" to be valuable. It's just not true.  More usage will correlate with higher value, all else being equal, but that's not the same as saying well, I don't know what he's saying actually, except the obviously answered "is Bitcoin worth nothing?"   
* And of course the old *Bitcoin is too volatile* argument. We are unarguably still in Bitcoin's formative years. Volatility is expected. Price discovery ain't easy for a completely new kind of disruptive asset.  Bigger, more established markets are more stable as a general rule.

Also remember, atomic swaps have not been deployed yet in large scale. It's purely experimental stuff happening right now. I'm also not really sure why you're parsing the blockchain data.    
Different groups are working on different implementations. Because while the concept to swapping coins is relatively easy to understand, it's not clear how a market will form around this idea.  There needs to be some kind of order matching service, and it's not clear what form(s) it will take, or how decentralized it can be.

You're right about idiots, but Bitcoin's adoption doesn't require that people use it without having custodial services, guarantee services, insurance, security services, etc.  The base layer of bitcoin can be, and has been built upon.  For example, if your coinbase account is hacked, you have some level of recourse depending on the situation.  No reason to think banks won't continue to be currency custodians.  The only difference with bitcoin is you pay directly for those services instead of having government socialize the cost to everyone.

1.  If you have a paper wallet, you can "sweep" that wallet onto your own wallet. I suggest for now you use a mobile wallet, Samurai, Mycelium, or electrum.  Before downloading the wallet, you may want to restore the mobile device to factory reset status, to reduce the chance of malware stealing your bitcoin.  Alternatively, you can merely check the balance of that paper wallet by typing the "public key" into any of the many bitcoin block explorers on the internet, like blockchain.info for example.  You may consider using TOR browser to privatize your query.  
2.  Here's a search topic that can help you find wallet files on a computer or hard drive:   
3. You can get help cracking a wallet password, for a fee, by using a service like this:     . Check his twitter, and google search to make sure you trust him first, but afaik, he has been reputable.

Bitcoin has just implemented a scaling improvement this year. One new implementation utilizing this new improvement is in beta experimental release, and quickly developing and growing and being piloted in wallets and services.  It's called Lightning Network, a sort of 2nd layer transaction scaling protocol, and in theory it can scale bitcoin to that next level, multiple orders of magnitude in transaction growth. But it's not done yet, and retailers and consumers haven't nearly adopted it. While that's not the only thing that is holding the price down, it's a principle one.    
In my estimation, we have months, at least, until we start seeing mobile wallets commonly used with Lightning.   That would tend to prolong this bear market.  ETFs being approved could, in the meantime, give a boost, but who knows? Anything can happen.   
My point is, yeah the price looks pretty good to me, but I wouldn't be FOMOing all in.

ETFs would be a validation by *polite society*, a sign of wider acceptance, and more objectively a pathway for investment by institutions that otherwise would not get involved in this market. You know how big the ETF market is, right?
Further, adoption is happening in so many areas that I don't think it's useful to speculate what will "cause" (correlate with, really) the kind of jump you're looking for.    
When the psychology of this bear market runs its course, that could be enough. Anyway, I don't really care about trying to time the next period of irrational exuberance; but just to observe it as it's happening is enough.

Exchanges that accept ACH, also accept the additional risk of using ACH, which means additional cost. You pay.    
Exchanges that only accept wire transfers are cheaper, but can't accommodate the tiny transactions that noobs, impatient people, and lower income people demand.

Also, "trying to suppress" in the short term isn't the same as actually suppressing for any significant time.  The smart money isn't as dumb as you think.   Wise people understand FUD cycles, and understand the value of information, and understand how to ultimately discern fact from fiction.

What do you think about private property? Vandalizing, isn't much different from rioting and looting.  Graffiti is a political activism method of the Left because they don't acknowledge or respect private property rights.    
Graffiti despite whatever implicit message it contains, always contains a meta message which is a claim of ownership of that property, like a brand; or worse, an act of war and destruction.   
Now, if you're going to tag property of government, that's a different story since everything they have they stole (they started the war).

You can also look up on whois, and the like, to see the registration information for that domain, to correlate with supposed owners, and check the date the site was created.    
That doesn't guarantee they aren't a scam, but it's the least investigation you should do.

The rate at which bitcoin is created decreases by half.    
Each halving is half as significant as the last, in terms of its effect on supply, and therefore its expected effect on price.      
You can look at the charts for the prior impacts. They seem to correlate with a price increase around that time. But again, their significance decreases each time, so I wouldn't be putting much into a prediction at this point.

It sort of depends on how you will be using bitcoin, and if you are the only person who is a signer-owner of these bitcoin.  
If it is only you, then I would use multisig hardware wallets (a trezor and a ledger nano for example) on electrum for the main stash, and keep a single hardware for smaller convenient amounts (and for a decoy if you get robbed).  Also a smaller wallet is good to create separation between your large stash, and the merchants and services you use. Otherwise, everyone you send to can see how much you have and tie that to your identity easily.  
The most important aspect of security is your own behavior. If you are the only holder of keys, then you will be a kidnapping target, especially if you have millions of dollars worth, and should take proper countermeasures.  Remember if 1 person finds out about your stash, you could be kidnapped and coerced at any time.  Think carefully about how you can prevent it, and respond to it. Think about front door security (hardware and procedures) at your home, and be aware of your surroundings when you get into and out of your car especially. 
Also remember storage of your backup seeds is just as important.

No. It's an open source project, an open protocol, not a skin care product; It's not even a "payment system", as you claim. Nobody has the authority to represent bitcoin. "Community driven" is a false concept. Only select individuals can drive it. And how are they chosen? "We" don't need a bitcoin authority.
