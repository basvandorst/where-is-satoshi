actually the future is what we make it, if we want a "get back" we'll make one.

Wow, I really wish I read this sooner. I had about $100 in a multibit wallet, and just checked today and it was all gone.

Yes but that’s only because you don’t pay a conversion if you don’t convert. but the conversion rate is hidden as in the value of what you paid can change. Maybe the amount in BTC was $20 in your local currency but then next week that’s $25 or $10. The price moves so much that you never know if you are actually getting a fair deal .

Thanks, I have downloaded bitcoin core but i'm unsure how to load the file from here. I see the open uri option but when i select my wallet.dat file it says the file is too large
@_date: 2019-10-21 02:34:01
Except it won’t be the same currency because the amount in circulation, and the amount left to mine won’t be the same.

No it’s not it debunks his point entirely. The argument is that instead of buying miners and electricity just put all the money into btc but there’s a big difference. When you put it all into btc you have to wait for dips if they even happen, so you spend $200 one month and the next month you put in another $200 your buying less btc (assuming a steady incline which I know isn’t the case right now with btc) so each month you gain incrementally less btc for your cash instead of investing the money into mining btc where you can calculate the costs and the return in terms of BTC. There’s a reason people still start mining farms.

So you’re saying you HAVE to calculate profit on a monthly basis? you can’t say I spent x amount a year and now have x amount profit ? If you spend x amount in 10 years and have x amount in bitcoin (and it’s in the green) you CAN compare future prices- because at the time it will be the now.

Yes, his username is fitting.
@_date: 2019-02-10 03:13:27
It’s $33 in btc a day right now but if he holds on to the btc and keeps doing this for 10 years it will probably be worth more than that. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 04:16:11
It’s not null and void. You have a calculated risk knowing exactly how much btc you can produce for the cost regardless of its trade value for fiat- versus putting all the money into just buying bitcoin each month at that months price.

Being backed by zuck isn’t the same as being backed by the us military like the usd is. I’m gonna just go ahead and predict the fall of libra along with the fall of Facebook in general. The youth already hate FB and instagram is ok but if they try to make it more like fb it will fail too. In fact all the social platforms are just fads that will die whenever a new one comes along that the youth like. It’s just like MySpace. Whenever People’s parents started making a MySpace they shifted to Facebook, then when the parents followed them to zuck they shifted to Instagram. Twitter is a weird one because people use it but it’s more like a news cycle machine instead of a social media outlet. Snapchat has the youth but they are fading away from that as well. 
I think we’re going to see a major shift in how we as a society connect online and while zuck is king I think he’s bound to fall. 
The ads are annoying, the politics are toxic, and people are going to become much more aware and concerned with privacy. We’re about to witness the anti social media, which will ultimately be social media repackaged.

No see- your paying to have a steady amount of bitcoin added to the pile. If you go straight cash you are buying at different prices each time. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 23:42:19
Lol finite demand? 
@_date: 2015-10-07 04:14:02
As a consumer I will never stand complacent  with sub par services. I am king! My voice will be heard!

Seriously like why are all these people so worried. I still have a scratched up space jam cd that plays without skipping. COME ON AND SLAM!
@_date: 2013-05-31 22:46:39
Yep it would be running non stop to cool off
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:24:20
Bitcoin has the power to end all government. I think it's the best thing to happen to society ever.
@_date: 2013-03-02 00:25:48
ok so the book keeping/ job you described... do i have to actually do something, or can i just keep my computer running all day and it does it for me?
@_date: 2013-05-11 02:30:10
dude, they have your pageviews
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:05:34
I told a friend about it, and he wants to get $5,000 USD in BTC, I've been watching btc grow since it was like $33... 
Anyway, i still haven't got any btc yet just because i'm lazy. I hate filling out these forms and making accounts and passwords. We need a phsical location to just run my Visa card. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:38:40
SO aggravating, should i buy some, or should i wait??
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:47:45
AWWWW YEAAAAH. Reddit got my back
@_date: 2013-05-31 17:06:16
if you heat the frige your fridge has to cool back down, and thats even more expense on your electricity bill. It would be better to put them in some sort of ice box

I was just about to post "What is the easiest/cheapest way to join a mining pool" I have a Wallet, now what? What does mining entail? Can i just get software that does it for me, turn it on, and wait? or does it actually require skill?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:16:38
I am saving comments of the non believers, so I can throw it back in there face in 2 years, when bitcoins still steadily growing. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:35:49
No you dumbasses, I'm the one asking for the money, clearly. 
@_date: 2013-03-02 04:10:18
Yeah but I don't really need to buy a tablet I'm talking about paying bills and stuff
@_date: 2013-10-23 04:03:14
Craigslist doesn't act as a transaction platform so I'm sure people are trading with btc already 
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:59:43
it's going to crash, so buy now? why don't i just wait for the crash?
@_date: 2013-03-02 00:37:08
The issue i'm having with it is, how will you ever see that money unless you 1. sell the bitcoin back for USD, 2. are able to spend it on the same things you use USD for.
