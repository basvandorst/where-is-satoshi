Eth already handles far more transactions than BTC and it's not even that good at it. BTS handles 1mln a second. Then we look at DAG technology like IOTA. Fwiw I don't own BTS or IOTA. ETH has already surpassed BTC and not run into those problems. It did at a later stage, well beyond the number of transactions BTC has ever had to deal with. 
There's definitely merit to your mention of decentralization though. Personally I believe we need to ditch PoW altogether and focus more on PoS and MN.

Fantastic point, thank you for mentioning it. I actively avoid BTC and never actually use the BTC network, but even then I'll go Fiat to ETH-&gt;ETH to different exchange-&gt; ETH to BTC -&gt; BTC to random altcoin that doesn't have an eth pairing.

Hoards of other technologically superior coins. 
That said, people are not buying BTC to buy stuff, or at least almost nobody is, so that argument of high fees and transfer times is moot. Although it's cyclical as those fees and transfer times are the reason that it's not being used for purchases. Etc etc
Either BTC gets significantly upgraded or a different crypto will eventually replace it. Personally, I don't mind either way. BTC is important due to it being the first but people have too much sentiment invested into it. It's not the end of the world if BTC eventually fails and some other blockchain, or I suppose DAG either, tech takes its place.

If it keeps crashing then it could go back to 10,000. Such good times!!!
Are you being serious by the way? Or joking? I can't tell.

I am a waygook that eats far too much 순대. No need to be worried (about crypto regulations at least).
