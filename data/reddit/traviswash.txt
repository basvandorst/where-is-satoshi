Roughly 2500 transactions fit into a 1 mb block. ([Source](
Given 144 blocks per day and ignoring delayed and replace by fee transactions, the number of transactions that can occur in optimal conditions daily are:
2500 * 144 = 360,000 Transactions per day (1 mb)
20000 * 144 = 2,800,000 Transactions per day (8 mb)
80000 * 144 = 11,520,000 Transactions per day (32 mb)
Steem which has a different scaling solution and free transactions model, also accomplishes an average of 1.4 million transactions per day while utilizing less then .5% of it's total capacity. (Statistics: 
I believe this only the beginning of higher performance blockchains coming into the space.

@_date: 2019-08-15 03:28:09
I'd say trade no more then 10% of the Bitcoin you have and take higher risk on the 10% with something that pays dividends, then put a stop loss on your BTC. Then later it would be easy to recover that 10% amount of BTC given that your stop loss is transferred into usd and the price fluctuates on a given month. Then once your portfolio has a basic dividends stream, maybe buy some of the major alts but also not needed. But generally I'd say you could make plenty here trading with higher risk on amounts like .1 BTC at a time and there's also sites that offer high leverage given you want to diversify into alts or buy more Bitcoin. For dividends there's several casinos and games on Tron and EOS that offer decent returns but takes a fair amount of research, it's best to test the newer methods small then build up over time if are getting decent results.
@_date: 2019-06-06 01:00:32
It's reality, how do you expect a small business to pay for thousands of transactions which would cost the average person over $300/year just for daily personal use?  [ 
We're lucky Coinbase pro is covering transactions right now for no cost to the user, it's the only way i've been able to keep using it for sending family bill payments abroad each month.

@_date: 2019-06-06 01:20:30
I don't think this is a good statistic because the Core wallet recommends to change addresses between every payment

I could care less about price performance, I appreciate platforms that have more opportunities to generate income other then centralized exchanges. Centralized exchanges will limit your actions and at any time can exit with user funds or cause severe outages. Talking like price performance is the  determining factor for an infrastructure's success as if the money is porn is a road to failure.

I don't get why someone would short with large capital near the the mining prices, there's such easier opportunities and plenty of math provided to know the electricity costs early. The transaction capacity and mining costs are the main factors at this stage for figuring a market value.

Also there's wallets that are known to have arranged user's funds being stolen so should be careful if choosing 3rd party wallets outside of what the Core team and Electrum (Light client) offers, especially if high amounts.
@_date: 2018-12-22 14:32:55
Some small exchanges that are suspectible and just started were no doubt doing things like running fractional reserves (Coinmarkets for example), I'd say the larger and established exchanges have a much lower risk of that type of activity going on currently.

The main chain must have some kind of upgrade over time to improve it's specifications, i've become tired of this common sense answer. If something comes along within the next 6-8 years the chain should still be ok usability wise at the current growth rate, though still holds risk of slowdowns during heavy network spikes or spam if no improvements to transaction throughput are given in the meantime.
@_date: 2018-12-23 05:47:53

Many projects are competent and well funded just like the current Bitcoin Core development team, and Coinbase also takes their time selecting new tokens or projects to be listed with high standards, so I wouldn't call it an illusion.
Simply going by the general price, supply, total volume, and token age you would be able to understand what stage of the project or asset you're investing in and the general risk factors involved.
