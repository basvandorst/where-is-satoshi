oh okay I figured, seems like a lot of people get offended when discussing it

secp256k1 is the parameters of the EDSCA curve that bitcoin uses to create its public and private key pairs. this does not use pseudorandom curves. this will be hackable with more powerful computers in the future and kill bitcoin. I'm a programmer and looking at it from the realistic use perspective and not purely investment

did the robot just take a shit?

basically any other coin that has more "random" hashing algorithms and a more stable price for using as actual currency in everyday life, there's a lot of them

thank you , 15 years is not a very long time , unless quantum-resistant algorithms are guaranteed

this was one of the first answers lmao , read my responses to the technical ones (hint: I "accept" them, whatever that means, without argument)

When I mentioned better tech I'm referring to other coins that use signing algorithms with random numbers, that some people argue are better algorithms for when quantum computing grows. But, I guess its necessary to take into account the 51% attack possibility as well

I reallllyyy need to find somewhere to learn about these bot traders.... very often I see the weirdest amounts being sold and bought back and forth in chunks , clearly doing something to the price. some big players know how to bounce the price around
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:40:48
so you're saying i can
@_date: 2019-07-09 05:31:44
what do you mean trolling lol , I asked about the security of it and asked if I was missing something. we are all trying to learn here. it was a question, not a statement. I did not know the signing algorithm could be changed at any time. I knew secp256k1 is predicted to be solvable by quantum computing and that bitcoin transaction speeds were laughable at one time. hence me asking the question as to why this doesn't matter, which has been answered without angry comments
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:28:47
I didn't reply to every comment i agreed with , and what he said was funny. I have no secret agenda , I literally made this post to understand why there was so much hype over bitcoin if it's known to not be as fast as some other coins when sending money and to eventually be crackable, which were all answered well
@_date: 2019-07-09 05:02:43
I'm talking about the signing algorithm of the private/public key pairs. supercomputers will "solve" secp256k1
@_date: 2019-07-09 05:23:31
changed it to signing algorithm, thank you , and quantum computing has changed the game.
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:42:49
thanks for giving actual technical proof
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:33:39
but it's not the best tech
@_date: 2019-07-09 05:26:45
what do you mean by quantum resistant , do you mean resistant to being solved by quantum computers?

? When I was in China I just swipe my US debit card at any ATM and get RMB our for no fee , this must be for something else

Don’t need to remove all crypto content to heavily damage its growth if you think about it. All it would take is to remove educational videos and popular trading tools around the same time everyone gets money for Christmas. Wait hmmm
@_date: 2019-12-27 17:54:44
Butttt YouTube IS owned by google which also just HAPPENED to remove Metamask from the play store around the SAME TIME.. hmmm...
@_date: 2019-12-28 03:21:26
True just playing devils advocate cuz it is strange
