Real-wages have declined or stagnated in the West, while the cost of things people need to buy every day have mostly gone up, except for the recent bust of the bubble in China allowing the inexorable decline in commodity prices to continue.


Yes and this causes real wages to decline. What other definition of inflation is relevant. Duh.
I will not continue to argue with an Dunning-Kruger idiot. I have more important work to do. So enjoy your oversized opinion of yourself in your next "rebuttal", lol.


These are the retirement plans, i.e. the common people. The rich are not those lenders in this ZIRP economy.


You literally are an idiot.

Not when the inflation is due to creating more debt. This is driving up the prices of everything the poor need to buy, thus forcing them to increase their debt to keep up. Debt pulls demand forward, driving prices higher.
The rich are the lenders (bonds, deposits) who are earning a higher interest rate than the inflation rate. Else as the case now, front running the bubble equity markets as there is so much debt money flushing around looking for a speculation.
