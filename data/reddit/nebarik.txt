Come to Australia. We have all that already. 
-Pay for shit with your phone (either tap it at stores, or instant bank transfers to normal people.)
-Transit cards. Tap onto the train with your phone. 
-Digital ID. Counts toward identity points + can be used at bars etc
-Smart locks and shit. 
Before anyone mentions, theres backups for all of this. if i loose my phone, im not completely fucked.

Apart from wanting to hide the money from his bank. Private or dealer doesnt really change how you can spend your money in aus.

man i sold at around $3000AUD (for a nice $15 profit) literally 2 hours before it jumped to $5000AUD in the span of minutes. 
We are all idiots on this blessed day

coinbase took me about 5 mins to signup and verify. then it was instant buys with credit card. im in Aus in case that makes a difference

Is this a american thing? Can you guys simply not buy something with the funds in your bank account directly? why does physical cash need to be involved.
