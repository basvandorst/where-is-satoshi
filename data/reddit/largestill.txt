You only lose it when you sell. Otherwise it gradually goes up over time. I bought a bunch around $100. I've "lost" over $1000+ more times then I can count. Now I am back up again and have lost nothing and I am way above my starting position.

Why is there such a small sample size?

Some of us are not panic selling. I am selling during the panic and buying once it's low enough to gain more bitcoin. 
It however, looks exactly the same as panicking. :D

I do it in small chunks. It's not about gaining everything on one big bet. It's about making small gains buying and selling during the fluctuation. This month just making smaller gains, I've gained .4 bitcoin.
My only goal is to get more bitcoin, so the price itself doesn't matter. Just pay attention and be in the right side of the sale regardless of the price. Some trades I gain .001 bitcoin, others .05. But always up and up. Not spending my money.
Chaos is a ladder. ;)

Yeah about that, but it was the only way I could get the cash off the Visa Cards so I didn't care about the loss that much. They were a free gift from work.
Now if I put my own money into BTC I'll be looking for a cheaper route.
However, I want to point out that just having an account with them for [10 days, after you deposited an amount of money, increases your account to a level 1]( and so on based on how many days you have an account.
They are trying to prevent scammers.

Time to get drunk on Bitcoins!

If you are looking to invest, check out ACISMining Shares.
This is an example of shares being auctioned off.
The current going rate for these is hovering at about 2.5BTC per share.
Focus your research there.

I didn't care if I made my money back. I bought them with my proceeds from trading against other currencies on the btc rollercoaster. So even if I lost money, it wasn't mine to begin with.

I picked up a 2 USB miners after the first price cut.
At a hash rate of about 660Mhps, I've made about maybe 1/4th the cash put into it so far and since the last difficulty increase I got back about 0.01 BTC every 4 days. It's likely closer to 6 days now.
Definitely never seeing that BTC back again.

I have an account, but I've haven't used them yet.
I am still a bit of a noob myself.

I paid with BTC using the QR code on my phone wallet and it worked great!
@_date: 2013-06-24 13:57:31
Without the cost of the miners themselves, tallying up the stuff on the side one the page it's $163 before taxes.

Heh, thanks.
@_date: 2013-09-25 18:02:19
I totally agree. I am not bitter about it. I don't really care if I see the btc back. I am also not paying for the electricity to run them.

Just so you know I just received my money now. Not 5 mins ago.

I used some Visa Gift Cards I had lying around the house at the start of the week. Here's how it went.
**Day 1:** $78USD from my Paypal deposited to my VIRWOX account. 
**$78USD is the max daily amount for a level 0 (first time) user.**
**Day 2:** $78USD more from Paypal deposited to my VIRWOX account.
**Day 2.25:** Flipped all my USD into 35,682.58 SLL.
**Day 2.5**: Flipped it all to make 1.08BTC
**Day 2.75:** Sent my BTC to my Wallet
**Day 3:** Wait.
**Day 4:** Continue to wait.
There is a 2 day hold on new accounts as they process the BTC manually.

But I didn't earn it doing work or use cash to buy bitcoin for them. I literally stole it from people who sold too soon. It's like when I got to the casino. I have never lost more than $20 because I refuse to take any extra money out of the machines. 
If I blow all my cash in one shot, I am done for the night and I hang out with my friends while they play. But what I do is taking my winnings and put them into my pocket till I hit $20. Everything after that is house money. No matter what I do the rest of the night, I am at worst breaking even.
That is how I think of my experiments with bitcoin. I am currently up over my initial investment by a good amount and I frankly couldn't care if I blew it till I hit my initial investment mark.

As an example there is a preorder from June, 23rd 2012 (that is not a typo) for auction on a more powerful one of these for a minimum of 50BTC. Currently the bid is up to 75BTC which is about $9313.89CAD.
The preorders for these are backed up by over a year and about about 40,000 units deep.
If you preorder now, you will never make your money back based on the difficulty curve.
