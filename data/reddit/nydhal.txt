Do they do auditions ? or can he pretty much suggest any personality on the show ?
@_date: 2015-12-06 11:18:34
Might be based on past trends.

They're getting the word out so that it happens.

This might not work in US or EU but it has better chances in other markets.

Any sources on this ? I'm interesting in learning more about it.
@_date: 2016-03-18 03:13:09
Some strong fundamentals!

Celebrities. Not enough celebrities.

His facial expression doesn't really help either.

Me too. I'm close to state so anywhere near is close enough.

I think he disagreed while agreeing.

I feel that people lose perspective when they're surrounded by peers who share their interests. Bitcoin is practically unknown and unheard of. It would be good for bitcoin to just be viewed. 
I believe, for bitcoin now, there's no such thing as bad publicity.

This, promote education and awareness of technology. Help the next generation learn from the mistakes of the previous.

What's a Zambilian ?

It is true, maybe redundant in this context but still a valid point.
@_date: 2015-08-04 06:36:43
I feel like people get too hung up on the "coin" part of bitcoin. The name is really a bad analogy of how it works. Every time I talk with people about bitcoin they directly think that in order to use bitcoin you need some integer number of these discrete "coins".

I'm from a developping country where it's still crucial to have a piece of paper that says you went to school.
@_date: 2015-07-01 05:27:42
Yes, you need to know html, css and javascript to do that. I don't think it's your best option though.

What's the best academic path to become an expert in cryptocurrency? I am transferring to university soon and I want to know is there any place with a renowned departement in cryptography/math/cs/maybe finance ?
@_date: 2015-07-24 02:29:27
There's a high rate of unemployment among university graduates in the country.

In a fair system those who make good decisions are rewarded (incentive) and those who make bad decisions are punished (disincentive). Nature works that way (consider vaccines).
Another more related example is that many of the countries where MLM schemes were rampant in the past found themselves immune against them when in other countries the population was inexperienced and hadn't learned from the past.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:30:36
True. My stance however, is let the people LEARN.
Government should not limit our liberty in the the hopes of protecting us from risks that we deliberately take, but only from risks which are out of our control.
When you decouple people from risks, they forget with time, and THAT IS when history repeats itself and past collective mistakes are repeated.
The gain/loss reward/punishment feedback loop should not be broken just because bureaucrats know better than the "layman".
If you patronize society you end up with children.

The logic mainly used is to not ban everyone from drinking, but just make it illegal 20 y/o and younger.
Same when requiring a driving license for people to be allowed to drive.
There is a spectrum of regulation that can be applied, and also a spectrum for the risk we are talking about (death vs financial loss).
I think the first principle should be freedom. And like everything else there is nuance... 
I didn't know about herd immunity, thanks for the TIL.

They hire other people.

That might be good advice. Not an argument to prevent people from experimenting with other options.

I don't know any charities so anyone will do. I just want to be part of this please.

Other than the English one the Wikipedia entries for blockchain are bad.

Wouldn't buying coins reduce the supply ?

Yeah, it's been $200=support, $300=resistance for a while now.

If the price is high enough, it might actually work.

"So what are these barriers that keep people from reaching anywhere near their real potential? The answer to that can be found in another question, and that's this: Which is the most universal human characteristic - fear or laziness?" -Louis Mackey

1. Twitter is a mobile app too. Not all traffic is from browsers.
2. Upvote/Downvote ?
3. That's true but you can still start with some niche. reddit killed digg. Facebook killed myspace etc...
