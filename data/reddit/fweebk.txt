what you are saying is that i should mine primecoin off of my cpu dedicated and gpus split into seperate processes of mining?
* :offreplytopic - noone pointed out amd and mantle, if you havent heard of this upgrade its been boosting gpus stupid unrealistically and i would like to know if 3-4x would still get btc with this upgrade

well i see BTC used as a legal currency in germany now so if its already in a country as a widely accepted currency and then i look at online btc stores and see me getting everythign i paid for in about 1 month i could only see a profit but not a big one

*how many would i need at this day in btc age and how long until ASICs stop working as ive read that they will decelerate eventually unless i mass expand into 100 more blocks out of nowhere
*LTC what is the current required for proper LTC gains

So i'm looking at block erupters and other random small priced/sized components and im wondering if anyone could give me a proper composition as im seeing basic usb block erupters and a brick and im not remembering what the brick is for but i would like an estimate of how many block erupters would be needed to proper value for mining and ASICs that can put me in  aprifitable gain to buy btc hardware and mine more and expand so forth.
*looking for a base composition for getting into a profitable gain and earing enough quick enough for quick expansions

will look into

ive seen like 100 needed and so on

ASIC's are the little usb sticks correct? premade for btc mining block.
oh i meant and you meant server.
i was talking about this method.
