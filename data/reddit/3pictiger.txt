Guys , a week ago they didn't have US only. The reason I didn't post on Reddit is because I thought you guys already knew about it.

Thanks for a filling answer. One last thing before I buy anything and try. how much storage space is recommended? :)

I'm sorry but over a week ago I tried to buy a game with an dlc there. The game was Evil within and the season pass dlc. So I paid to the address they gave me at the checkout with my greenadress wallet. After I paid the correct amount I went back to the checkout. And whoops. There was a new payment address and my payment was unnoticed by their system. So now they have to give me the game manually I guess. But first they have to find out what went wrong and if I actually paid for the game + the dlc. After tons of support mails, I've waited over a week. They have not given me any game and still has my btc yet :/ here is the address I paid on the checkout: 
No worries tho. Its an new payment method and I won't judge them. They will hopefully sort it out.

Finally not just me having issues. Their system indeed have a bug or something and are not working as it should do. I've waited for over a week which sucks. They told me they are waiting for respond from the payment provider or something. Maybe bitpay?

Wow, that is really nice, good job! Is this easier doing with raspberry pi? I would like to buy one and set up a full node:)

Thanks m8 &lt;3 Those charts are really supporting. Makes it worth investing my money into BTC. I have no need for it now anyway. In the end, if bitcoin goes mainstream, and selling bitcoins into fiat again is like selling my trust to it and that will never happen!  And I have not invested more than I afford to lose, but would be great to own a few extra btc that I can have in the furture ;)

oh lol that grammar tho. Not very happy you posted that ;(

 Maybe steam next? Steam/Valve doesn't wanna miss out. Maybe they start realizing that bitcoin is not a bad idea at all.

I think about it and I don't need the money before many years. And I really hope BTC will be a mainstream thing so I have no need to exchange it back to my national currency and I can pay with BTC where ever I go. Pay on internet, transfer money to friends, pay in store etc. In the near furture I will see QR code in all stores and such. And don't get me wrong, I know and Im not trying to be rich quick by BTC. All I did was buying trust to BTC because I believe it beats every other currencies with all its features and are our answer to the corrupt bank systems and currencies around the world. Bitcoin is here to stay and so are my money and trust to it. 
Sorry english is not my native language. Deal with it ;)

Same here! I've learned about the bitcoin technology since summer. So far I've not exchanged a single bit back into fiat yet. I've only spent and spent. Mostly on games and services. But I'm not only spending, I'm holding to some. I'm around 2 BTC now. Bitcoins is no longer a strange technology but something I strongly believe will replace the way we control money. And for me it's seems like bitcoin 
Is close to the tipping point. Just please stop speculating what the price will be maybe next year or so. Stop worrying about the price. If you already own a piece of a bitcoin or maybe a few of them, you are already aboard the train.  Just wait and see. The bitcoin technology is far more valueable. The price doesn't tell if bitcoin is good or bad right? I think the technology is pure perfection of what money should be. Having your money in mathematical perfections feels much better. No human errors, so you can do whatever you want with your money without the government/banks being able to control and watch it all the time. I love this. I'm so excited for a new year. 2014 have been great! I'm doing it right uh? HODL!
