I would describe it as a decentralized network where each individual has the freedom to conduct their business in a way that they see fit, but on one platform where they are linked to many other people like ebay.  The OpenBazaar network provides the option for moderation/dispute resolution that would not be possible on your own web server or at least not for such low fees or level of trust as on OpenBazaar.  It is an option to join a network of peers that you can dictate the rules but also be connected to many other people at the same time and build a reputation that will allow others to want to do business with you too.  Yes, having your own web server is the ultimate decentralization but then you are missing out on the advantages of networking, chat, dispute resolution, and the basic infrastructure of the site that allows you to set up a store quickly and easily.  Many people will choose to have both options to give them to flexibility they want and let their customers decide.

OpenBazaar is the best e-commerce site I have ever used.  While there are still improvements to be made, compared to something like Ebay, this platform is a new paradigm for the global economy.  It has a social media feel to it with chat and the ability to follow other stores which makes a great place to network and find good deals. Also a very updated look and the ability to customize your store in anyway is really a big step forward from traditional stores and is a great improvement. Bought a couple small things today and opened a store so we will see how it goes but I am very excited to use OB.  Thanks to all the people who worked to make this happen!

I would recommend trying to find a bitcoin meetup in your area to find people that could help you. (if you live in Minnesota I could help!)  That being said, for smaller amounts of bitcoin there are many apps available to store bitcoins on your phone such as Airbitz or Mycelium.                               Mycelium also sells a device that prints off paper wallets offline from any printer...  .  It looks pretty easy to use and set up.  Let me know if you have any more questions...here's an example of self publishing a short story for bitcoin if you didn't see above link...

Good point on the changing of QR code...didn't think of that.  2FA on FB account to change personal info?  As to FB getting their cut, that's BTC greatest competitive advantage that no other system or organization can compete against bitcoin's low transaction fees and consumers will choose the cheapest option, all else being equal so it could eventually be a hard sell for them.

You sit down at a cafe and start ordering by scanning the QR code next to the menu items and at that instant the order is sent to the kitchen and to your server and the items are paid for (no more walkouts).  The first time the waitress greets you she already has your drinks and she quickly goes over the order to confirm it is correct and inform you that the food is already being prepared.  Each table would have a QR code for tipping (could be done throughout the meal).

I don't get why everyone assumes that it will be taxed and that they feel obligated to send money to the tax man before there are any laws on the books.  If it is deemed to be taxed in the future you can always amend your return after a decision has been made.  Also, will you then be able to write off the losses of the Canadian dollar?

Yep, once people realize that you can exchange physical goods for your digital money they get real quiet...they won't admit you're right, but it plants the seed of change in their mind and they become more curious about bitcoin.  I try to show people that they can buy stuff they are interested in and show how easy it is to use once it is set up properly.  It is a steep learning curve though so be patient and remember that you have to be true to yourself and not let others dampen your excitement because they don't understand something.

Your FB account getting hacked does not equal your bitcoin wallet getting hacked.  As stated earlier in thread you can change your wallet at any time and not use your real name (as many people already do).  I guess my main point was that FB is spending investors money on going through the legal hoops of being a money transfer business when it is already possible on their platform with bitcoin and I don't personally see how the company can improve on that except...like you said...more privacy, but many in the bitcoin space are already working on that.

While the volatility issue could be here for awhile until the marketcap grows the issue of sending to the wrong address is not much of an issue.

The gyft cards that scan right from your phone are the easiest payment system i've ever used (target and starbucks usually have the scanners).

 You can tip up to $25 dollars and if you want to tip more you can email them and request a larger amount.  They would have to ask for money from people which is uncomfortable for some people and changetip offers a service where it can be sent directly to them without them asking and it gives them an easy platform to get used to using digital currencies.

They are the last defense against tyranny.  One of the first things a dictatorship does after gaining power is to ban guns so the people cannot fight back.  The founders of the US understood this well and knew that without the 2nd amendment all the rest of the rights granted to us are meaningless.  I myself have never owned any firearm but I will always defend peaceful people owning guns even if they are making them in their basements.

If you don't have/want a bank account and you have reached the saturation point of your product/service in your local market (Maybe someone who sells their art in an area of the world with limited or no banking options but with internet access).  Open a store on OpenBazaar and open your business to possibly billions of more customers with an international currency.  I don't understand how some don't see how big a deal this could be.  Thomas Friedman wrote a few years ago how the internet would flatten the world- and it has to an extent with sharing content, but there was still a lot of friction for business because of the limits of the old finance and commerce model limitations.  Bitcoin and Openbazaar are quickly changing that.  No matter what it is worth it to me to try out and build otherwise we are telling the rest of the world that they have to wait until a JPM bank branch is built in their village and for them to be vetted by them before they can start a business and make a living with access to the whole world and not just their local economy. The time is now...the future is here.

Thats why it was given the title  "thought experiment" not "real life situation that you need to take seriously".  Of course you are right especially since DPR was taking commissions.  How about people coming up with code words on ebay to buy/sell illegal stuff while ebay is taking a commission?

Really enjoy your show and you guys have really forced me to rethink a lot of stuff and I have gone from "everything needs a blockchain!!" to "bitcoin may only have niche use cases that not everyone will need". But I think you guys focus too much on regulatory arbitrage that relates to drugs and gambling and neglecting other use cases such as people without access to banking or people who would also like to sell legal items but have no identity tied to them.  Another thing that I can not offer on my own website is the arbitration feature which will not always work out perfectly but at least there is some measure of protection if the transaction doesn't go through as planned and reduces some of the risk.  I really like chat feature as well, which of course can also be done through email but it works really slick and gives it a social network feel that I haven't had before from ebay or purse.  While its not perfect right now I continue to use OB and look forward to future improvements.

I disagree with many of the OB team on scaling but Openbazaar 2.0 is amazing and imo one of the most important platforms for bitcoin. Their built in wallet is segwit compatible and was one of the first to implement it.

People here talk about revolution but it will never happen unless more people are aware of the benefits of bitcoin and that will only happen if people start using it more to support the businesses that were brave enough to join this experiment with us.  
It happens too often where i go out of my way to find a place to spend it and the place no longer will accept it or they forgot how to do it due to lack of people who want to use it.  
The media is still able to spin the "bitcoin is only used for bad stuff" smear campain imo if there is not strong merchant adoption by the general population.  We need merchants saying "I was a little hesitant at first but now it brings in an extra few hundred dollars month with no fees so it has been a great business move and all the bitcoiners are really polite and helpful."  That is how the network effect will really grow by word of mouth.  
Revolution is never easy and without making personal sacrifices it will never happen.

It costs two cents to mint a penny so the gov could save money and boost their margins of money creation by using a colored coin or sidechain where one satoshi would equal a penny at a fraction of the cost.  This could also cause more demand for the currency as more people around the world could easily convert to any currency they wanted and will seek stability.  And the best part is the country to do it first would have a big advantage of lower prices per satoshi than late adopters.  Of course us crytocurrency nuts will still use whatever we want and it will be super easy to convert back and forth.

From my understanding it is like the theory behind six degrees of separation where any one person can be connected to any other person on earth by connecting through common relationships even though they dont know each other.  BTC nodes need to be connected to 4 or 5 other nodes to ensure that a consensus is made between all other nodes but it would be redundant to connect to more.

It seems to make more sense to use a public blockchain that I could use to fit my business needs that could work anywhere and is open for the people I do business with to use in a way that fits there needs with no counterparty risk.  It would be like setting up a new email server for every business relationship instead of using one shared protocol that can communicate between them all.

Congress voted for the war. The people I voted for were not elected and I hope they would have voted no to any war of aggression.  I never got a ballot in the mail with the option to vote for or against the war.  I believe that money is free speech but the power of the federal government should be so little that the money that is given to them has little to no effect on my life and more decisions are made on a local level so that if I disagree with them I can move to a different location with different standards.  I agree with a lot of what Bernie says but I don't agree on his proposed methods of how to get those results.  There is no free lunch and every action has a reaction.  This guy sums up my views of Bernie's plans pretty well...

I've always wanted a wallet that I could have my shipping address set as a default setting so that I could quickly confirm on my phone where I want the package shipped while at the same time paying for the item.  This could dramatically change advertising and the way we buy things.  An ad like this could be in any magazine, newspaper or digital media and with a few steps on your smart phone you could purchase and have any item shipped to you.  An ad could look something like this...

Had some weirdness with WFC accont today as well.  Signed into my account and their site required 2fa for the first time but only had my old phone number listed so I called the number given.  After being on hold for awhile and  answering a bunch of questions they finally allowed me access but they said I needed to submit my new phone number otherwise I would have to go through this process every time to bank online with them.  I asked if they could do 2fa thru email or other app and they said no.  For this and many other reasons I'm closing my account tomorrow and moving my business to credit union.  Don't want to jump to conclusions but this was the first time trying to log in since linking my debit card to the btc exchange I use about a week ago.

"Health cost rising has to do with our political system being bought" and "voting matters" are complete opposites and makes no sense and to justify voting by saying that we voted for a horrible war that even Tony Blair has recently said contributed to the rise of ISIS does not help your case either.

1) it is easier to buy btc now than ever so i can spend as much as i want and still save what i can plus save money overall with discounts.
2) by doing that you support more of the overall ecosystem 
3) how fast would email  have caught on if no one ever used it?

Probably a bit too complex to start with but I think it would be really cool to see a menu with QR codes next to the items and customers could pay/order at the same time and the order would be sent directly to the kitchen.  All meals would be prepaid so no threat of "dine and dash" and staff could have more time to serve customers instead of taking orders and processing payments.  Just wanted to throw the idea out there.  Best of luck!

It is powerful not for individual citizens to vote on every issue but to have their views acknowledged in a provable way and to quickly and easily gauge the public's overall sentiment.

The statements from the lady representing the Bank of England were some of the most condescending statements I have ever heard.  She was basically explaining how they needed to dumb down their dialog with the public so that we could understand that stealing from us through inflation and bail-ins is a good thing and needed for a strong economy and if we don't agree we are too dumb to understand.

I agree...I appreciate and find value in a lot of what my local government does which is mostly funded through property taxes.  There are things I would change but overall it doesn't keep me up at night.  On the other hand I find much of the 3+ trillion in federal tax dollars to be used for things that are redundant, wasteful and/or dangerous.  I still think voting for local government can still have an impact (especially if you live in a small community) but on the national level I agree with this Princeton study on voting...

I want to see advertisements with QR codes that consumers could scan for instant buying from print or digital mediums.  Your wallet could have a default shipping address for easy shipping.  It would be easy for consumers to buy goods and services and great for sellers to allow purchases in a new and cheap process to implement.

I had a great experience with the online class "Introduction to Bitcoin" given by the University of Nicosia.  It was co-taught by Andreas Antonopoulos and provided a great foundation for learning about digital currencies.  The first class is free and they do accept bitcoin for payment if you want to earn a Master's Degree in digital currencies and they give you a certificate of completing the first class and they enter it onto the blockchain as proof of completion.

Went to St. Petersburg to spend some bits last week and two out of the three places I tried were set up with Bitpay but didn't know how to make the transaction mostly because very few people are using it in their stores so there is a lack in training.  On a positive note we had a great experience at Ferg's Sports Bar where the waitress knew exactly how to take the payment and remarked how easy it is.  My gf went from rolling her eyes every time i brought it up to saying that i should hodl on to it but imo it will never be worth anything if more people do not experience how much better it can be.  Merchants will stop taking it or lose interest if we dont show the benefits by supporting businesses that do accept btc.
@_date: 2015-02-05 06:45:10
There is no reason not to accept it as long as there is someone that will convert it to another currency for less than credit cards and have it in your account the next day. Then they will start using it for b2b transactions/working capital to effectively move money around the world for little cost and the recipient can do whatever they want with it.

I agree after reading more on Nakamoto's philosophy. On page 31 on the above book excerpt it goes into his business philosophy on the importance of business transactions being "truthful, honest, and fair" and how trade is enhanced when trust is maximized.  Maybe he was the inspiration for the true Satoshi and, like you said, Craig did a little homework so he had some clever but inaccurate statement to make to further his bamboozle. Thanks for all your work and his speech today finally motivated me to start up my first node...BIP 148 of course:)

No, you are right and I was trying not to blame anyone in particular but my original post was slanted towards blaming them right off the bat but I left it very open ended because I have no idea what really happened and just want to prevent other people from having bad bitcoin experiences.

It is very hard (impossible) for many people to set up traditional bank accounts.  Many people forget that over 6 billion people do not have access to banks and this gives them the only option they have to transfer and collect money.  
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:13:02
Yeah but who does that?  Usually I trust websites to tell me accurate information when Im just trying to part with my money.  I guess my whole point is that the bitcoin community needs to be aware of issues and problems with it so that it can solve them before people who are not deeply in love with bitcoin have one bad experience with it and turns them off the whole idea forever.

I stopped by their "headquarters" after I became worried when my small deposit was was taken out of my traditional banking account and was not reflected on my CampBX account.  My anxiety grew as I entered the building and found no signage or any other indicator of their presence there.  I took the elevator up to the address I sent the check and personal information and was greeted by two secretaries who were very professional and attempted to help me as much as they could but they had very little information about the group of people who were running the exchange and they said they only showed up about once a day.  After she said this my stomach sank and I was almost certain it was a scam.  I tried to email the address I was given but no response and I began to consider legal actions to try to get my money back.  Well then I waited another few days and checked my account and after around 3 or 4 weeks the money showed up in my account.  Needless to say I purchased bitcoins immediately and moved it out of CampBX. It worked in the end but not great customer service.  Best of luck!
