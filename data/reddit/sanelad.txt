I'm sorry kids but that's a taxable event.

I suspect most of these whale orders are really wash trades run by shady trading firms or the exchange operators themselves.

Joke's on them. I've been buying the average. Now I'm 50% down. ,��

Can't we all just agree to ignore that guy?

Thank you Mr. Whale. BTFD!

I get your point but your examples are weak. MySpace  was a train wreck with shitty management. And MP3 is older than AAC and was simply not "worse enough" than AAC to be supplanted. Network effects are strong. AAC is catching up finally though.

Google TrueCrypt or VeraCrypt and plausible deniability. I recommend it when crossing the US or Chinese border.
The much harder problem is custody. Unless you are a total loner, you'll want some way to pass your coins to your family if anything happens to you. Any scheme to pass on your coins to less tech-savvy persons tends to undermine privacy efforts. I haven't yet found a good solution to that.

Very cool. Seriously though, electric heating is the most expensive form of heating, even if you mine some coins on the side. This is wildly unprofitable unless you have access to free electricity.

Actually, I wonder whether the rate of Bitcoin being mined is greater or smaller than the rate of Bitcoin being lost via lost keys or fudged transactions.

They're trying to appeal to institutional investors and people who don't want to get into trouble obviously.

It's this again. Those who care about the "not your keys..." mantra don't hold their coins on an exchange anyways. And those who do won't be bothered to withdraw them.
I don't hold my coins on exchanges btw.

It certainly breaks design copyrights. It's fine as long as it's not done commercially.

Bottoms are round, not spiky. But I admit, I'm tempted to double down right now.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:12:09
True. Also, no wash sale rules around crypto. I wash sold a 20k loss on Dec 31 that I will subtract from my gains from regular stocks. Btw, shout-out to CoinTracking.info. Expensive, but absolutely worth the money for anyone with a non-trivial number of trades to report.

I look at lottery as reverse insurance. You may choose to pay a small amount every week, in exchange you have a tiny chance of getting rich. The expected value is clearly negative, but at least you have something to hope for. Sad, perhaps, but not irrational from an emotional perspective if you have nothing else in life to hope for.
I don't play the lottery btw.

A bank run only works if you actually have something to withdraw.

10x? What are you smoking? 10% down in one day is quite common in crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:03:22
Good job timing the market.
@_date: 2018-12-13 02:54:44
Too bad crypto is unusable as currency for US tax residents because of retarded tax laws that treat even the smallest payment in crypto as a taxable event that (in theory) would need to be put in your tax report. The overhead of complying with this bullshit far far exceeds the transaction costs on the blockchain.
