Thank you. 
Just was nervous I had some kind of shitty altcoin when it didn't show up on blockchain.info ;)

Everyone in this thread is nutty af...
Why are you trying hide shit from your wife?! If you fear she is going to snake you in some way, why the FUCK are you married??
My wife knows about every single satoshi I have. She trusts I know when to buy/sell. The only thing she cares about is that I'm not putting us in financial distress by investing...which I am not.
I think you should tell your wife and change your lives. If you feel that you can't tell your wife, then you should probably re-evaluate your marriage.

That you trust more than...your WIFE?

Beats me. 
I'm not the best financial person. I have taken profits along the way. I have a nice-sized USD savings. No holdings/stocks. Currently repairing credit so I, too, can buy a house.
Why they haven't sold until now is crazy to me because I've bought and sold the entire time. 
To each their own I guess?

Why? Same exact story with me except I take profits and diversify outside of crypto as well...
