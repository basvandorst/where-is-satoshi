So basically what it boils down to is that BU supporters are holding segwit hostile in an attempt to force a compromise where both segwit and blocksize increase is implemented because they don't believe it's part of Core's roadmap.  Hence this is may be their only chance to get a blocksize increase. 
Basically BU is sorta like House Republicans and Roger Ver is like Paul Ryan. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 06:03:51
Not just Jihan though, Roger Ver seems to also be adamantly opposed to it as well.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:30:35
Of course.  But following that logic.  All else equal supply and demand.  Fees should be lower.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:13:48
So you are saying that Segwit won't be default.  But you'll have a choice on how to send the transaction.
Would the immediate efficiency gains from segwit have an impact on transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:20:43
Anyone know who are the ones mining it and the distribution?
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:04:04
So theotically someone could rewrite history or roll it back to a certain point with an 51 percent empty key.

PIVX being another one but until Ethereum switches to POS, we haven't seen one in the the 1 billion market cap club.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:06:06
Can you elaborate on how nodes fork off and how there would be cost but not the other.
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:52:51
Would this in your opinion be likely to prevent any of these coins to be reliable network for a top tier coin?
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:22:38
You mentioned nxt.  Do you know how pivx deals with pos issues?
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:46:15
Why isn't it goos and which coin with PoS would you say is good or at least better?
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:34:04
What do you mean if at any point a private key held most x, it could rewrite block history?  How can that be true.
You are saying that in theory, someone or entities could buy up 51% of the coins; then sell it and then rewrite the history?
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:12:30
Could you dumb down your explanation of the "system is defined from within" problem?  Or is this the least technical as it gets?

Dash is a hybrid would would probably be considered more Proof of Activity I'd assume.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:25:08
What do you think of the following argument that suggest it's not really a cause for concern.
Btw what is your background?  You seem to have a plethora of technical knowledge.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:10:09
Care to share more of your insight on PoW vs PoS?  It might be a little bias but it would be interesting to heard the other side of the argument.
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:05:29
so coincap.io APIs are closer to real time than coinmarketcap?
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:06:05
Can you elaborate on how nodes fork off and how there would be cost but not the other.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:18:09
Thanks for the reply.  Can you further elaborate what you mean by too aggressive for a security-first Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:18:25
Thanks for sharing your opinion.  This might be the most informative post I've seen on reddit for quite some time.  
Is it generally difficult for coins to change or update to next gen PoS models?
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:41:46
Can you elaborate on the pitfalls of MB being too big to the average Joe?
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:07:57
So hypothetically, someone or group of people could buy up 51 percent of the coins.  Sell the coins and the  simulate the whole blockchain again.
Essentially fork it into two identical versions?  
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:42:41
So you are saying that it's not so much about technical aspect but rather politics that's the issue?
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:43:52
These are all great points.  The only thing I would like to add is that most coins have a fix supply cap.  As the limit are reached, in theory it would seem that PoW would have the accumulation issue as PoS.  If someone held 10% of the coins and never sold he would have the same 10%.
I am speaking about the concept that the rich gets richer in PoS which I think is a misconception.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:31:20
So transaction will just fail and not go through.  
@_date: 2017-04-29 07:32:42
Good points.  With regards to decentralization, do you see any long-term solutions to the dramatic decrease in full nodes?  I can't see any long-term solutions to this without implementing some sort of incentive system for people who host full nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-29 01:42:49
Can you explain what you mean by messy and exploitable?
@_date: 2017-04-30 00:51:28
I feel what you are saying.  When I first started sending bitcoins around I had a bit of the same things.  I ended up sending the bitcoins in pieces.  So if I wanted to send 1.5 btc, I would send .5 first just to make sure everything worked ok before sending the rest.  
@_date: 2017-04-29 01:53:37
Is there a way to implement incentives for people to run nodes?  It makes sense to take a bit of mining rewards from the miners and distribute it to people holding the nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-28 22:19:18
In and ideal world, we need to reunify the role of users and miners.  And segregate the role of miners and mining hardware manufacturers.  How that can be accomplished is the difficult question.
@_date: 2018-03-25 01:57:13
Do you know whose coin it is?

We had 80-90% corrections with Bitcoin before.  So it may crash considerably more, but I don't think Bitcoin will be dead.

Thanks for chiming in here.  I usually follow the mtgox cold wallet monitor site you provide.  It's the one I known as the mt.gox address as well.  But it seems like this address is believe to be affiliated by some others as well.
Here's it discussed on BitcoinTalk Forum
The dates of those transfers though do line up to dates of price dumps.

Thanks for sharing but I am actually referring to some chinese websites that are in chinese.  Preferably with translate but ok if there isn't translation.
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:20:43
Excuse me for my ignorance.  But how does a fork actually work?  Technically speaking?  Do miners get together and just agree to change the rules after a certain time or block?
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:06:02
Then my follow up question is what happens if you solo mine?
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:39:07
So you are saying that if you recover with another trezor, you'll see all your accounts but if you recover on something like Nano Ledger which doesn't have multiple accounts, you will just have access to the first one and the 2nd one wouldn't be there.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:40:54
Thanks mate.  Do you know where's the block height?
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:52:46
This was totally FUD.  Even if they get a warning it doesn't really impact anything in a meaningful way.  I do believe this was the trigger for the pullback though.  We were due for one anyways and this just gave it a reason.
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:41:22
No you were right, I got it now.  Missing 3 zeros.
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:04:06
So does the network determine the whose transaction gets included in the next block depending on the fees automatically?  
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:36:16
They say BTC moved

My apologize of this possibly being a very dumb question.  Is Tor just a proxy browser and why is the IP address important?  Also what you are referring to only applies to web based wallets and not desktops right?
@_date: 2016-10-23 02:21:29
Just want to thank everyone for their comments.  Learned lots and sped up my understanding 2 folds.  There's still some questions I've got but I guess the best way to learn is to try.  So I think I am just going try out a bunch of different wallets and play around with them.  Thanks again guys.
@_date: 2016-10-23 00:18:24
Ok, I think I have a a better understanding now.  Thanks for the explanation.
It seems though that most if not all web based wallets require identification but offers convenient.  And the desktop ones have more privacy but less inconvenient.  Is this because the web wallets are also exchanges or is there exceptions to the rule here?
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:28:15
Do you recommend shapeshift or a tumbler?
@_date: 2016-10-28 23:44:27
This might be too complex for me to understand but how do you associate transaction to a specific wallet?  It's not like a address is associated with an wallet right?
My understanding of the ledger system currently is that the recorded info includes the following: 2 address (Sender and Receiver), Amount Transfer, time and possibly ip address if someone is listening otherwise not even that.
So how can you connect anything with such limited information.  
@_date: 2016-10-23 00:42:28
Why don't you recommend blockchain web wallet?  Is there one that you do recommend and why?
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:07:54
How do you know that's a Kraken account?
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:38:28
Lightning Network is not possible without Segwit.  
Atomic swap can help take off some of the load for Bitcoin though if there too many transactions by kinda outsourcing the smaller transactions to some other alt coins.  More than likely though atomic swap or not, Bitcoin will still be the reserve crypto and the most valuable coin.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:52:54
Does it?  Because from my interpretation.  The droplet burn rate is for preventing spam, not for Ripple's revenue stream.  I am sure Ripple makes profits in many other ways than transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:48:51
How is Roger an altcoiner?  That doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:05:06
It needs to own XRP so that it can sell it into the market for the currency it wants, but that XRP isn't destroyed.  So in reality the price of XRP is irrelevant to bank transactions as they probably buy and sell the XRP holding immediately.  My understanding is that it's just a quick and easy way to match currency swaps.
 
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:18:42
That's right.  I know this might be counter intuitive.  But like you said if they need to transmit current market value of XRP.  This buying and transmitting in market would be instantaneous right?  Otherwise you carry forex risk.  
If you and I were a bank, would we care about the price of XRP?  Not really because we are not holding XRP long-term or speculating.  If $1 USD is 1 XRP, I'll buy and transmit 1 XRP.  If $1 is 10 XRP, I"ll buy 10 and transmit 10.  
So I don't see how the price is correlated in anyways with the transmission mechanism other than the transaction cost for the banks at least.  Or am I missing something here?
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:44:23

In reality, Jihan the tank driver is a nice guy.  He maneuvers around the guy multiple times.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:25:23
Ya so what I mean is that Ripple system can function great and Ripple can be super profitable with XRP being worth 1 cent.  It would not affect the banks at all.  As long as the XRP market is liquid it's fine.
The price of XRP is arbitrary dependent on uneducated speculators and is not supported with any fundamentals.  There is a bottom baseline value though which is the transaction fee but that is incredibly low.  
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:36:49
Thanks for the response.  It was educational.  I agree that the price can't be too high otherwise transaction fees would cost too much, but I am not too sure about it be too too low.  But I guess that would be subjective to what is too low.  There is a limit in coin that is ever decreasing, but I would argue that the rate of decrease is very minimal.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:41:25
Thanks for the explanation.  So just to reiterate.  Basically hardware wallet uses 24 keywords to generate new addresses for all coins it supports.  And it will use, what I assume to be the first 12 words for Bitcoin because it's 128 bits of security.  I am assuming that if you lose your trezor and tried to recover your wallet online, you would just use the first 12 words of the 24 you have been provided. 
Any idea which coins uses the 24 words?
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:02:38
My curiosity is that they give you the choice to choose.  And I am just wondering do users usually have a reason to choose one over the other?
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:17:59
So if you lose your wallet for example.  And did not want to get another trezor to recover the wallet.  Is there any particular web/mobile wallets that would be compatible or incompatible with  PBKDF2-SHA-512?
