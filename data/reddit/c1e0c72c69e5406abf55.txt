So only .25% takers fee?
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:47:44
Kind of but with I never have to deliver the money.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:01:29
I want it? But probably too late..

Still manipulating Reddit votes and/or requesting and writing a very specific fan fiction isn't hard, whose to say you aren't any of the commentators?
That being said I don't think you are any of the commentators, but there has been a number of these posts on that never pay out.

I feel like I could get anything from if I just promised a lot of coin in exchange for whatever I wanted.

Pretty sure Imgur strips all the EXIF data on upload so you are good as far as that is concerned.

Well and the Reddit account/person verifying it, if you send it to yourself over the blockchain how would anyone know?
Edit: Even then could still be you really.

Yes they do, its basically just a sub division of Coinbase. I couldn't really compare it to the other exchanges because I am not familiar with them but I do like the interface, you can see a demo of it [here](

If you use GDAX, Coinbase fees are pretty much non-existent.
.25% as a taker and that's it.
@_date: 2016-09-07 00:04:58
This seems super fishy.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:53:20
Remember people BCH != B2X, BCH had replay protection but B2X will not so it will be a different and even harder process to move your coins properly.

Actually it is ridiculously easy even without the key and just a ballpoint pen. [Video](

Pretty sure they just want you to link your bank account they ask for account number and routing number, then do two small &lt;1$ deposits. I've never seen any company ask for your username and password for bank linking. I'm linked to my bank account never asked for my username and password.

You use something like Helix or you just move the coins around from different addresses wildly usually using software so nobody knows where they go.

Yeah I originally did it via PC maybe something is up with the app.

That's not a specific email address just a tag for an email everything between the + and @ is ignored by the mail server and the email goes to support

There should never be anything proprietary in crypto that you want to trust with any sort of sensitive information. Proprietary is bad for crypto you cannot assess the security of a cryptographic algorithm if it is proprietary.

I mean there are plenty of betting sites that take bitcoin already like [Nitrogen Sports](

To be fair they can claim its anything they want it doesn't mean shit if you can't see the code. But I have poked around and does look like [they are]( which is a good thing.

If you are on Android check out the Bitcoin Checker app, I've been using it awhile and it works really well.

The developer of the site he deposited into yes.
