It is very cool. Doubt a sidechain would be needed. Counterparty, might even be something that they have working today. I also think that is an idea open bazaar is working on.

I will say though, I love his tweets. Some of my favorites.

James DeAngelo of worldbitcoinnetowrk nails this idea [here]( And offers the most compelling fix I've seen.

How about some intelligent discussion on the paper? Anyone?
I found the paper to be pretty dry. Couching a lot of rather mundane topics with a flourish of confusing words and phrases. Example...few current bitcoiners would refer to the 'Nakamoto  Consensus' which is really just proof of work and mining. He reminds me a bit of Nassim Taleb who likes to invent a cool sounding name for every idea he comes up with. I call this tendency the Taleb NameCoin Fallacy.

Agreed. His black swan book, I loved. His most recent book is masturbation.

Well its the data he has that is powerful. It would seem obvious that if we change the number of roll-calls in Congress that that wouldn't correlate at all to inequality. But what if it correlated almost perfectly, that would be chilling. [Here's some of the new charts that James has]( and man, the correlation between the House Roll Calls and inequality is terrifying.

You missed one:
FOUR: It highlights how much more corruptible a sing faction can be.(The link between banking corruption and voting was spot on and a real revelation to me).

Nixon's Ghost Bill appears to be an 'ooops' of epic proportions. I don't know what to say, we've spent 50 years without noticing the obvious, that the benefits of secrecy in voting apply to legislators just as strongly as they apply to individual citizens. This could very well be the missing link between money and politcs. Bravo.

Huh? The whole video was full of examples. Most of them currently working.
