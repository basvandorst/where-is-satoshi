wow thats so crazy. I've been completely verified with them for years and have never done anything suspicious other than occasionally transferring some btc to btce which I haven't done in more than a year. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 09:41:03
where can I sell btc instantly for USD with no limit that is trustworthy?
@_date: 2015-12-11 09:40:07
wtf so they purposely targeted me? I also received an email from them suspecting me of selling my bought BTC from their site on ebay and localbitcoins (which I never did)
this is ridiculous

how come Panama?
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:16:58
yeah I've never heard of the st petersburg bowl
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:53:31
Why would someone wanna do that? I've seen that but I'd rather buy when I knew the price was low instead of having it some automatically
@_date: 2014-11-18 09:24:30
Yeah you make good points. I think I will try this method out. First I need to figure out how much I'm willing to invest. Then I'll use that number and divide by three and do three separate buys
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:54:45
I love 8-Bit Pale Ale. Man I wish there was a liquor store around that accepted BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-08 19:29:21
and there goes my neck
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:19:56
Where can I buy that shirt your dad is wearing with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-19 15:11:06
would be kind of a hassle buying 40k(or so) worth of btc via localbitcoin, but that is a great idea.
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:58:02
oh, im an idiot. still tho when I do that nothing happens, with all the scripts on
EDIT:nevermind somehow I got that yellow snapCard box around the pizza. thanks snapcard bros!
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:43:20
uhhh hi &lt;3
EDIT: youre cute OP uguu~
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:41:10
double the subscribers, thats pretty cool
@_date: 2014-11-18 13:09:47
I believe in bitcoin much more than I do gambling in a casino
@_date: 2014-04-19 15:26:04
Denmark too has stated they won't be taxing btc
@_date: 2014-04-19 15:14:40
lol. id rather not my profits go to pay off the debt we the people owe to the federal reserve for letting us borrow their precious fed notes
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:16:42
We should subtly inform the masses of ways to bet online with btc too. Decentralized gambling will probably be a big step to the adoption of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:46:37
Having some issues. I run noscript but even with it turned off I can't drag the pizza to the bookmarklet 
@_date: 2014-04-19 15:09:08
So I should just be ready to pay the government a lot for the future profits? No way around it? 
I know its probably too early to ask since btc is still pretty new, but I'm wondering if maybe moving to a different country with my btc would save me a lot in taxes. Countries are still learning about btc so who knows what their future regulations will be.

Man those were hilarious
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:25:06
oh cmon its a great show to listen to. very fun. i don't believe in any of those but it is very interesting to listen to.
@_date: 2015-05-05 09:06:04
I got one. Was awesome
@_date: 2014-11-19 00:15:17
Thanks I'll read that

@_date: 2016-06-13 13:57:57
i was using a vpn to get there but it's a hassle. I was just looking for alternatives. cant wait for a somewhat decentralized betting app on Ethereum that can't be pushed around by government restrictions
@_date: 2016-06-03 19:09:04
fuck coinbase. use gemini or kraken I would recommend
@_date: 2015-07-23 23:22:18
you haven't provided any proof
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:59:10
I'd recommend to buy eth and wait and see if u want to transfer into btc after the fork
@_date: 2015-07-23 23:09:42
can you provide proof that he's an attempted murderer?
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:26:30
Bernie is a commie bitch, fuck him
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:27:27
Well first off of you think marriage should be overseen with the government, which I don't nor did his dad want, then it shouldn't be a federal issue at all
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:37:42
man fuck off.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:34:00
what is it that Rand would do that is too religious for you?
seems like most his positions are backed by the idea of free choice.
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:55:05
No prob man just ask. I've been buying with coinbase for a couple years. Even once your credit card is accepted you can only make purchases of up to $1,000 in bitcoin that you will receive immediately. It does suck you gotta wait so long to get your money but I do like coinbase overall
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:14:26
It's similar to coinbase, you give them money in exchange for bitcoin
@_date: 2015-09-07 22:01:37

Whoever wins, we lose. The only exception is with rand Paul but even he isn't perfect
@_date: 2015-09-12 00:04:30
Makes sense for supporters of this anarchy style currency to have thoughts like that
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:25:35
Who the fuck else would you vote for?
@_date: 2015-03-31 13:19:07
sorry i've been out of the bitcoin loop for awhile. so this is a usb drive that has your wallet on it and its very secure? 
@_date: 2015-03-31 14:06:02

What are the differences in circle to coinbase? How safe is circle?
@_date: 2015-03-31 13:15:36
support overstock bro!
send them an email about how u feel I'm sure they'd read it
@_date: 2015-03-29 11:04:57
How come?
@_date: 2016-07-31 08:21:36
whats wrong with having a free market? or are you one of those authoritarian types who think people shouldn't do things that you don't want them to do?
also people usually have to be selling drugs in order to be called a drug dealer i believe
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:11:45
Lol you think that if we stop following the rules that corrupt politicians put in place to micro manage our lives, that then civilization will fall apart? LMAO
@_date: 2016-07-31 08:04:09
TIL creating a black market website makes you a drug dealer.
@_date: 2013-10-30 11:50:49
I guess it kinda is. Always thought it was it's own nation since the brits gave it up
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:57:14
You need a Chinese bank account for that
