Typical economist waffle. When will they admit defeat and say their models have absolutely no predictive power.

A thought. What if the simulation is run with a probability weighting factor that makes new nodes more likely to connect to the currently best connected nodes?

Well we're getting there. Not long til they realise this wonderful technology utterly depends on bitcoin.

Im not entirely sure how you eliminate any potential bad actor through the payment system itself though. The point Im making is it seems illogical that people can object to a bitcoin economy on the basis of consumer protection when this is perfectly feasible within the framework on a voluntary basis.

Antifragile, thrives off the odd knock and comes off better for it.
Even more antifragile, the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem. A whole genepool of variants waiting to expand should bitcoin lose the way.

Simple solution. All true bitcoiners must commit an act of money laundering. A la Mafia code of honour.

I would ideally want to keep mine as savings (they are after all just money!)
However, like most I have a few key values that might tempt me to cash out (mortgage mostly!) As much as bitcoin is maturing we are still carrying a lot of risk!

Because we thrive off shocks, questioning the security of the system makes people realise how robust it really is, likewise developers are made wise to potential flaws at the point of interface between bitcoin and fiat. This makes bitcoin a better currency in the long run.
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:28:55
Understand where you're coming from. My heart drops when someone tries to sell something to me. The thing about bitcoin is it's very complicated at first (and fascinating) hence it's probably a bit of a nerd instinct to explain it and promote it.
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:11:04
They were a minor correction compared to the scale of the error, a warning that the cycle of pumping cheap debt into the system was a major flaw. Steps since that have done nothing to help, by "cushioning" the blow with QE and low interest rates we are suffocating real entrepreneurs by keeping  failed businesses alive. The market it is antifragile, intervention is not.
Bitcoin is the market, Bitcoin is antifragile.

Question, how does one verify the public key from here? I am led to understand that the address (i.e. public key) acts as a tool to *encrypt* a message, then the private key is the only bit that can *decrypt* it. Hence, if the network generates pubkey(apples), I can reply "apples" without having to reveal my private key to verify ownership of my coins. Not quite sure how one does that with the public key as is?
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:18:26
Personally I wonder if we are going through a bit of a "post bubble mining selloff".
We had a huge spike early this year, leads to a spike in pre-orders on mining gear.
Give 6-8 months latency for equipment to be developed. Users receive gear, need to guarantee income so they start selling instantly rather than keeping it. Especially for any mining businesses who borrowed to fund their activities.
Suspect we need some big money input to break out of this. Halving day seems so far away!!
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:27:56
Hell yes, especially if they've never used it. though personally I would send an encrpyted paper wallet within a card or something like that as a personal touch. I did it for family member at Christmas, you can then give them the encryption password over the phone or something when they are ready.
It will almost certainly be a unique and curious gift!
@_date: 2014-12-20 11:12:50
What does the network do when we hit the limit? Presumably no further transactions until that block is solved thus generating a backlog of transactions?
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:49:39
yes, it was a flaw in the system, a broken market and it had to die. Would've caused far more problems if it had happened when BTC was running at $100Bn market cap.

Does he seem to think we need a monetary system that will just erase the wealth of the super rich? If so he is sorely mistaken. We cannot and should not attempt to restrict free trade which inevitably means the super rich will get their slice of the crypto pie. The real democratisation of money comes from the fact that once finance is fully p2p-cryptographic, there is no financier gatekeeper anymore, taking their bribe to grease the wheels of trade. Bitcoin will have worked when the bulk of the Wallstreet/square mile offices lie empty.

Hi man. Thanks for the offer and sorry for the slow reply. It's been a mad week. I think I can break down my own uncertainty over bitcoin scaling into two questions. 
Firstly, does activating segwit introduce any technical risks to the function of the main blockchain? The significance of this being, if LN doesn't work for whatever reason but it doesn't affect bitcoin as we know it, then there isn't much to lose; whereas if it introduces a bug to the main blockchain, the effect could be very severe.
The second question is: are there sound technical reasons why node incentivisation is a bad idea? The idea being that as much as the blockchain could get very big, with a financial incentive nodes could recover enough expenses to store the data/ handle the traffic of a higher transaction rate.
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:32:39
Agreed. Long time follower of bitcoin, but I find it so hard to find reliable information on scaling. Plus pretty much any board will be unapproachable if you ask a "what if" question.

2019: unsustainable hype bubble in crypto currency crashes leaving major financial institutions facing large losses. Ironically bitcoin bludgeons to death the institutions it was meant to sidestep.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:37:32
This makes no sense. If it is widely used then it is prior art and cannot be patented.
Unless I'm wrong, in which case I'm off to patent a disc shaped device which can be used for moving heavy loads over long distances.
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:06:51
This is true. Analogous to mining perhaps? Although at the moment there is a price sensitivity to overcentrslisation. Thinking back to the ghash.io debacle.
Am I right in thinking to mine effectively you need to have a full node anyway? That leaves some indirect incentive at least!
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:33:12

Tradeoff is simple. You need to remember a password! Or write it down and store in separate location (another important bit of paper not to lose).
@_date: 2017-04-23 07:49:43
Not to forget bip38 encryption with its associated trade-offs. It is a good way to avoid exposing the paper wallet via the printer (part two of your post) but of course you need to remember or write down the password!

Chances of a typo being a valid address are vanishingly small. Like 1 in 4 billion.
@_date: 2015-04-16 06:56:29
I suspect the biggest risk to the protocol sits along a divide and conquer fault line. Subvert the community by making them disagree on one (or many!) issues which require a hard fork. Cause enough division and you can undermine a whole project. I don't think this can happen currently as we are a small, well informed community with a clear cut narrative of what is wrong with the current monetary system and what needs to be done about it (not trying to speak for everyone here but I believe there is a consensus); but as bitcoin grows we will have to embrace a larger chunk of humanity who may not agree with things like a finite coin supply or lack of state control and will try to change bitcoin from within. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:26:28
This. I strongly suspect card providers simply aren't capable of meeting this price. They will have to cut costs and boost revenue elsewhere. Expect it to be harder for small startup businesses to find card providers. Expect hidden fees to merchants too. If fees are put on the card user... We win.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:15:46
This. If you want user level decentralisation, then decentralise proof to the user level. Easier said than done admittedly.

Happy halving. And many more of them.

I want segwit first, hard fork later if needed. But I accept the compromise for the good of all of us.

Just as fractional reserve banking was possible with pieces of gold back in ye olde days, it is possible with bitcoin.
It simply lays bare the fact that the value in your bank account isnt "your money" per se. It is a deposit held by the bank in good faith.
It does of course mean there is nowhere to turn if we see a 2008 style banking crisis. Bitcoin quantitative easing cannot exist without violating the 21M coin cap.

With HSBC, no issues buying, inclined to start a new account somewhere if I cash any out. Has anyone published a friendly/hostile list of banks in the UK for BTC? Might be good to start a rating system based on people's experiences.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:07:34
So true. We must all learn compromise here. We must even take risks for the sake of compromise. Tech moves fast, we could be irrelevant almost overnight if we are not careful. Segwit2x seems to be the last hope to make a breakthrough, failing that I think the chain needs to split, which will be lethal to our market position. To all, please don't kill the goose that lays the golden egg. So often I see threads about btc's relative decline, which are immediately commented on by blaming either core or Ver/Jihan. It needs to occur to people that after 2 years of deadlock this "debate" is going nowhere. Both strategies for expansion are valid AND NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE!!! Let us move forward ASAP with Segwit2x. I just hope the team working on it can deliver, and wish them luck in meeting a very challenging deadline.
Peace to big blockers and 2nd layer alike
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:20:33
Indeed. I think Jihan posting this lacks a certain amount of emotional intelligence. Just look at the division it has inflamed. He could have waited to allow segwit 2x to gain some momentum...
