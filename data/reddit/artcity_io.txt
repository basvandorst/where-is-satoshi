Correct, that is left to the lawyers. Ascribe allows creators to stake their copyright claims to the blockchain which is admissible in court as evidence. This was the case during the recent Silk Roads proceedings.

Correct, which is why ascribe created the SPOOL protocol (Secure Public Online Ownership Ledger). You can find details for this on their website. Ascribe.io

I provided the art piece IDs already in an earlier comment, but in order to share the actual file itself ascribe's system requires an email address. I'm not trying to be secretive, just have to use the system as it is designed. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:04:07
Ha, that is a very small yield sign. The art you purchased, was it backed by the Bitcoin blockchain? Was it a certified edition? Will you be able to sell it later for more than you paid for it?

So the condensed FAQs page does its job. The video just goes into greater detail. Don't hate for the sake of hating.

Nice, we can add that image on the back of the shirt.

You're welcome for the gold. How do you plan to track the usage of your artwork? That is another service that is provided by ArtCity through ascribe.

Thanks for promoting our post on Tondo. If you're interested in collecting art that is protected by ascribe's technology please visit   Our marketplace is being developed and will go live in the very near future.

Correct, this system does not prevent someone from copying the file but it does track the whereabouts of the file throughout the internet. Only the buyers of authentic editions will be able to sell their editions. At ArtCity you won't need a membership, just register for free. No fee to buy, only to sell.

The system uses auto bi-directional links (reverse attribution) to track the location of the image file itself. The technicals are beyond my comprehension, but I am told that it requires machine learning on an internet scale. 
The image or video that is registered is of the highest resolution and most artists only release lower resolution files online for free so the version you might have on your computer may have the same name, but it's in fact, not the same file that has been purchased directly from the artist through ascribe.
The CCOA (token) is what creates the scarcity and represents a file but is not the file itself.
You cannot purchase a CCOA (token) by itself. It comes with the associated file. If you did purchase an edition on our website a copy of the edition would stay on our server, you can download it as many times as you want, but once you transfer ownership to someone else through a sale you will no longer have access to the CCOA or the file on our server. You can still keep any copies you have downloaded but you will no longer have claim to a certified edition.
Thanks for all the great questions.

I don't suggest spending your bitcoin just yet. Can you imagine the buyers remorse you'll have when you realize how much you spent on a beer after the value of bitcoin goes up?
@_date: 2015-06-14 08:00:48
Each edition is associated to a cryptographic CoA. The CCoA is what protects the buyers claim to value and ownership. Only his private key will execute a transfer of ownership during a sale. All of the details of the CCoA are recorded on the blockchain via the SPOOL protocol (Secure Public Online Ownership Ledger). "Anyone else who gets a hand on the digital file has exactly the same thing..." Almost, they have the same image but not the associated CCoA. The free copy will remain free while the certified copy can grow in value as the piece becomes more viral. One very important thing to mention, ascribe is crawling the internet searching for all the instances of these registered artworks and can provide the creators with that information. It's up to the artist to decide what to do with that info. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 10:00:48
Thanks for the suggestion. We are looking into this to see if it's a viable option for our company. We'll let you know what we decide.

Sell more artwork at a lower price and lose the trust of all their initial buyers, yeah that makes so much sense.
Correct, but if he does something to damage that meaning there goes that trust thing again.
@_date: 2015-06-14 08:13:42
Why would an artist's water down the value of their own artwork? It is not the word of the artists that guarantees that a piece is edition 1/100, it's the information stored on the blockchain via the SPOOL protocol. Once recorded on the blockchain it cannot be altered or deleted. Do you even know Bitcoin braw? The CCoA, cryptographic certificate of authenticity protects the value while the artwork justifies the value. Call it speculation but I heard the same argument when Bitcoin first came out.

Congrats to the team at ascribe. Developing an ownership layer for the internet is no small feat, but their team of experts are perfect for the job.

The first-ever ascribed e-book recently sold on Twitter. Only 10 unique editions will ever exist. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:56:03
Please send me a private message and include your email address and I will share the original edition for each art piece. There you will be able to see all the details you need to verify that this transaction was executed on the Bitcoin Blockchain.
