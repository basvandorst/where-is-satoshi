seriously?!? if this is the image of bitcoin you wanna promote mainstream, dont wonder if its not appealing to women :(
@_date: 2014-03-17 10:26:41
Yes "Multiple Outputs Transaction" is working already with the Android Bitcoin Wallet from Andreas Schildbach. He implemented support for the BIP70 ... so you can donate to all your charities with just one transaction. The supporttr app is requesting the transaction - the local wallet is executing it :) Hopefully other Android wallets will support this in the future, too.

Sounds good. I have to look into f-droid .. or can someone help me out?
In their wiki they say "Please check the inclusion policy to make sure your app is suitable for inclusion in the official F-Droid repo." ?!?
As far as I was able to take care of it - all used libs are based in Apache License, GPL and Creative Commons or Public Domain for the pictures. 
Would be great if someone can cross check my code on git hub and let me know if it will work with the inclusion of f-droid.

yeah maybe. I dont want to judge how anybody personally relates to women. Its a free minded liberal community. If thats your style of party go ahead have your personal fun.
Just keep in mind that women have a strong lead in making financial decisions (single households and family) and are at least 50% of the mainstream market. This video is not helping selling Bitcoin to them - quite the contrary.
EDIT: OK there might be a little bit of hidden humor in this video ... but really I dont get it, sorry.

thanks a lot!

Check out  ... same idea as flattr - 100% Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:22:20
now on my feature list for a future version :)
@_date: 2014-05-21 14:17:21
... and. now. its. dogecoin ;)
@_date: 2014-11-23 11:05:17
sure - its your choice.
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:16:44
It would be cool to connect the app to a browser plugin ... but thats not a quick todo feature. Maybe in the future when I got the time and budget. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:32:52
Its my result from the Texas Bitcoin Conference Hackathon last week :) 
Its an early release - working fine with the Android Bitcoin Wallet by Andreas Schildbach - other local wallet integration will follow. Its Open-Source on GitHub ... so feel free to help out.
Let me know your feedback, ideas and bug reports. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:51:10
let it rain dogecoin on them with the dogerain app: 
perfect ice breaker
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:06:24
By giving 1 to 3 stars in the bookmark list, there is already a mechanism to rank donations and influence the split every donation bookmark gets.
At the moment a second scan of a QR code gets ignored when its already in bookmark list. Its a good idea to give an extra push in the star rating instead ... will put this on the feature list for the next version :)

Check out my open-source project supporttr - a flattr-like app for recurring Bitcoin donations --&gt; 
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:32:19
I think that started 4 years ago with "flattr" and alike. The reason was that all the good domain names where already taken or costing too much because of domain squatting.
If someone is willing to buy/transfere supporter.net/com/io for the open-source project I would consider changing the name ;)
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:35:25
having the app open you can collect dogecoins from other users making it rain. And you can make it rain on other users too. perfect way to get your first coins and play around. great for meetings and parties. just try it out :) 
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:59:39
Check  ... its a decentralized recurring donation app - no central service is needed.
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:51:05
Oh man thanks - got that fixed!
Its supporttr - like "support" with an extra "tr" at the end.
Maybe not the best name to remember - it was inspired by "flattr" ... same basic idea of the servicie but this time decentral and transparent thru the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:45:33
hmm thats right. biggest investment on the name so far was buying the domain and printing a t-shirt :) but its a open-source project running on donations itself - so thats about 1000% of the budget at the moment ;) 
As long it is not a show stopper i would prefer to keep the actual name setup. Instead of going thru a lot of places and changing the name, I would like spending the time on the code itself.

Dogecoiners already doing this world wide with the DogeRain App 
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:25:35
thx :) I saw how many bitcoin services and media rely on donations at the moment. 
I hope an app like supporttr managing monthly donations for the users will help to create a constant stream of support for those projects and keep them on growing ... including all the great charity projects out there making it a better world.
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:36:04
done. check out 
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:38:46
rock n roll :D
@_date: 2015-05-27 12:51:17
I think the IBM app was just an PR-Tool and has no plans to be for everybody ... dogecoiners are making it rain with the DogeRain App since early 2014 and still rocking it. Look at the World Map at  :D
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:31:37
thanks for getting the news out :D - the wiki is just starting to fill up ...
This is a video documentary about the last Camp 2011 - for all camp starters:
Happy to see you there - if you have any question just send me a message.

Every fork called "Bitcoin" will stick to the 21 Million hard cap - that is kind of hardcoded into Bitcoins DNA. So that way transaction fees will be the only thing left to pay for miners to secure the network (far far in the future).
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:32:34
I know some people dont like to hear about it, but Dogecoin is the most popular alt-coin that will give-out block-rewards forever and will keep transactions cheap that way. We discussed this some days ago on this blab video chat: 
@_date: 2015-09-09 17:04:00
such currency, much wow, to the moon ;)
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:55:25


All those costs u mentioned need to be paid by the miners. If there is no (or a very low) block reward, all costs need to be covered thru high transaction fees. That is the future of Bitcoin, when most of 21 million coins are mined. Dogecoin will output mining-reward forever and keep transaction fees low thru algorithmic controlled coin inflation.


You are correct. But at the moment Bitcoin has an even higher coin inflation per block than Dogecoin.
@_date: 2015-03-10 10:17:52
Bitcoin's built in deflation ... so maybe take a look at Dogecoin ;) to the moon :D
