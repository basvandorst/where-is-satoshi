You have the private key for the bitcoin wallet, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:58:58
The private key for a BCH address is the same as for the equivalent BTC address. You should be able to just import your BTC private key as a BCH account to get access to the funds.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:01:43
Yes, although you need to make sure you use the correct derivation path, assuming you are retrieving your key from the mnemonic.
Most likely you want to select "BTC" as the coin and use the default derivation path. If the public address matches your expected address, then the private key should work for both BTC and BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:06:13
Yes, in your case, you need to get the private key for that BCash wallet from Exodus, and import it as a BTC account.

Check out RiffTrax. Its by the MST3k guys and is basically MST3k but for modern movies, where you just buy an audio track that you sync with the movie. (Pro-tip: you can usually find torrents with the RiffTrax audio pre-mixed).

You need to import the key somehow. I'm not familiar with the Bitcoin.com wallet, but there should be an "import" option somewhere.

Naw don't worry about it. Merry Christmas!

If this were at all possible then Bitcoin would be worthless. The the chance of brute forcing the private key to an address a with non-zero balance is so astronomically low that you will be waiting until the heat death of the universe.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:38:57
Just import your BTC private key into a BCH wallet then (i.e. with Coinomi or any wallet that lets you import keys)

Every time you connect that machine to the internet you are opening yourself up to potential attack. Modern operating systems are only "mostly" secure, and it only takes one zero-day exploit for someone to hijack your machine in the short time that you are logged in.
If you don't want to trust a hardware wallet, make a paper wallet on an airgapped machine. Sign transactions offline then move them online via a QR code.

It is a scam. This guy is talking out of his ass.

Tether has shown that a stable cryptocurrency is obviously useful, since it is much easier to move than fiat and is censorship resistant.
Dai is an Ethereum-based token that pegs its value to USD via market incentives and is backed with other crypto-assets. Kind of like when USD was backed by gold, Dai is backed by ETH. Soon it will be backed by a pool of assets, which will ensure it stays stable in the event that any single one fails.
It has no central issuer like Tether, its issuance is governed by a smart contract, so it is immune to the potential fraud that Tether is being accused of.

Stablecoins. Designed to be stable with respect to fiat currencies.
If that fits your definition of shitcoin then I can only imagine that everything that isn't Bitcoin fits your definition.

If everyone had agreed there would be no "Bitcoin" to sell because there would not have been a chain split. Everything would have continued as normal with one chain, except with increased maximum block sizes.
@_date: 2018-08-25 19:51:45
This is some schizophrenic word salad.
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:47:31
Regardless of how much Tether can actually be trusted, it should be clear that the crypto-economy is now extremely reliant on a central actor. This is counter to the entire point of this experiment.
Tether needs to die, either violently or slowly become irrelevant, in favour of decentralized stable currencies like Dai. Or at the very least we need much more healthy competition in the space, like DGX, TrueUSD, etc.
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:57:29
a) This is not an audit.
b) Tether is still *not a legal claim to 1 USD*
If we want to create a decentralized ecosystem we need to stop relying on single points of failure like this.

If they're all bought with funny money then their value will drop. Get your head out of the sand.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:57:39
You are confusing market cap with actual wealth. If I sell you one of a billion tokens for $1, I don't suddenly have a billion dollars. Over-valued shitcoins are just propped up by the fact that nobody is trading them.
If $2 billion in actual wealth was removed from the space, you can bet you'd see a $100 billion drop in the total market cap.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:05:06
It doesn't really prove that they weren't printing Tether earlier this year to manipulate the market. Then they just sell their BTC at the top for real USD and suddenly they have enough money to cover the printed tokens.
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:21:37
Obviously this won't work, as you have no guarantee that the original manufacturer didn't just copy the key before covering it, or that each bill has a unique BTC.

I'm not sure you can run a cryptocurrency on proof-of-hate.

Look up "fractional reserve" and you'll see how a lot of paper wealth can vanish when the small amount of actual money backing it disappears.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:21:07
Lots of better options are coming around. Tether has the first mover advantage, but people need to educate themselves about alternatives.

I sold 10 BTC for $10 way back in the day to buy a game on Steam. Do I wish I hadn't? Sure. Does it keep me up at night? No.

This is true of all fiat-backed stablecoins. JPM Coin is just another in a long list. I'm glad for more options beyond Tether, but anyone who thinks this is interesting or innovative is kidding themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:43:56
You can already short bitcoin on many exchanges by peer-to-peer lending. You put your Bitcoin up on a lending order book where traders can borrow it for a small fee. Ideally the trader will try to borrow your BTC, sell it high, then buy it back low and give it back to you.
Of course in times of high volatility the price of lending goes up considerably.
This has nothing to do with "hating" bitcoin and is actually pretty integral to the liquidity of the market.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:33:29
Keep in mind that Tether can also be used as equity to short Bitcoin on Bitfinex. I would argue that issued Tethers are only a bullish sign if they happen during a market correction, near the ATH it's a much more ambiguous signal.
@_date: 2019-02-15 03:59:07
News flash: All fiat-backed stablecoins (Tether,USDC, TUSD, GUSD) have this feature as well. The only difference is that they put the backdoors in the smart contract, rather than in the underlying protocol.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:43:54
Keep in mind that if you had access to your BTC there's a very good possibility you would have cashed out a large chunk of it on the way, either as a panic sell during the crash or when it became worth a sizable sum.
At some point during the crash you probably could have bought up to somewhere around your 50 BTC, but you chose not to because there was no guarantee it would be worth anything later.
Hindsight is 20/20, if we could see the future we'd all be millionaires.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:42:28
If you printed a billion bitcoins, all of the existing ones would be worth less than they would otherwise. That's simple economics.

I challenge you to find a country selection on their payment portal that allows you to deposit Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:57:55
This is nonsense. Adding more Bitcoin to circulation devalues the existing Bitcoin, any way you slice it. It'd be like if a meteor crashed to Earth full of gold. All the people holding onto it as a store of value would be pretty upset.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:41:28
Yeah, this is just a CFD but without a trading platform around it. This lets them jump on the bandwagon without actually needing to have proper backend support.
People definitely should not be supporting this, as it doesn't contribute at all to the ecosystem.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:22:27
If they were presumed destroyed, then suddenly having them accessible again is effectively the same as printing new ones.
*You* are the one frothing at the mouth for "cheap coins", obviously implying that you believe their value will increase to some particular price point regardless of the total number in circulation. This is absurd, devaluing all coins by adding new ones will reduce their value *forever*, not for some brief moment in time just after they are introduced.

As long as the hardware wallet has been initially configured correctly, the worst that a virus-infected PC can do is request a malicious transaction. Your keys can never be compromised, but you can still be tricked into sending Bitcoin to the wrong address.
You need to double check each transaction on the hardware wallet itself (i.e. validate the receiving address and amount on its separate screen).
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:57:15
It holds it and keeps it isolated from other devices (I.e. potentially virus-infected PCs), while still allowing you to access your Bitcoin by signing transactions on the device itself.
Computers are inherently insecure, and so hardware wallets are a great way to mitigate the risks of cryptocurrency. Otherwise one slip up could have you compromising your private key and losing everything.

It says "OP has no idea how currency trading works"
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:48:31
Additionally, exchanges usually support something called a "trailing stop" order. If you think the price is going to go up, but then dip again, a trailing stop will catch this.
For example if I buy in at $2400 and put a trailing stop of $100, it will trigger if the price goes to $2300. However if the price spikes by $200 to $2600 then the trailing stop goes up with it, so it will now trigger at $2500 for a $100 profit (per BTC).
Obviously it'd be best to sell at $2600, but as far as anyone knows it could go up to $2800 (and your trailing stop pushes up to $2700).
This lets you catch near the tip of the peak, without actually needing to babysit the price all day. Obviously if the dip is temporary and it keeps going up, then you'll lose out, but that's just how the market works.
Disclaimer: As others have said, barring incredible luck or lots of research, you will almost certainly lose money trying to time the market.

Still not even the right order of magnitude for cracking any serious encryption. And yes, as others have said the ASICs used for Bitcoin are only good for doing sha256 hashes, we're not going to see them repurposed for anything useful.
