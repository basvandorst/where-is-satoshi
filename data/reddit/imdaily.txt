So cool seeing all this generosity!

according to an interview with the founder  they get millions of pageviews a day and have over 700,000 users. This is all targeted traffic, which is more likely to click. I'm not sure exactly what the commissions are for their affiliates, but you can usually assume a couple dollars per thousand pageviews per month. Back of the envelope math would put them at a 4-7K/mo, but it could vary wildly depending on actual traffic, conversion %, and commissions.

Let them. The more people using it, the bigger the incentive for people to build out the infrastructure, and the more reason an increased adoption. Banks are where the money is - their investment says that the people with the power to change the current system are getting behind us.

Thanks again!

This is huge! The more traffic this gets, the more people will see how viable it is in the real world. This has the cool air of new-aged exclusivity that will help to build our community.

I'm not sure there's any  at the moment that accept US players other than SatoshiPoker. I haven't played in a few months, but it always seemed like nobody was playing cash tournaments, just freerolls. 
edit: Probably not worth your time due to the lack of players, but if you did want to deposit I'd check out the latest reviews to make sure they haven't gotten sketchy.

These guys are idiots, ignore them. Anyone who knows anything about poker can tell you the same guys make it to the final table at the wsop every year. Saying past scenarios can't inform future decisions is ignorant as fuck.
