I just bought some stickers from ya, love the work man! 
Edit: though, I would love to be able to encrypt it with a simple passphrase if I wanted to. Possibly have that wallet look a bit different with some indicators that its secured with an additional passphrase, just in case something like a safe gets stolen, we could rely on our other backup.  :)

Dude, if i was trying to scam someone, I deff wouldn't post to reddit trying to do it. Esp not in a bitcoin sub where I assume at least 80% of the people here have, as much, or more knowledge of scams within the coin community. Not to mention I stated that I would be willing to do any additional safeguards to protect the buyer. Oh well :/

That's not what salt is.  Salt is additional data like a second half to a password. Essentially its like this.  (key/pass-phrase + salt) -&gt; Encryption Schema = Hash

Im getting ready to bring a 1200GHash/sec worker pool online. I too welcome the challenge. ;)

How do you figure? Even if difficulty is at 75M it'll still ROI within 5 months....
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:14:12
So here's a question, and excuse my ignorance if it shows. How would you get the salt thats added for the hash generation? If the site that helps you generate the BIP38 hash goes under, how would you decrypt the hash even with the pass-phrase if you dont know the salt it was created with?

Yea, it seems they adjust it only when it benefits them. Ive seen differences of 300 sometimes in the spread.. I think once I liquidate my market stances, ill be done with them.
