Yep, valid for me too (on firefox).
@_date: 2016-08-01 08:19:23
Yea, same. I hope lightning network and segwit are ready before the shit hits the fan. The next crisis is not more than 10 years away (imo).
@_date: 2016-08-26 21:47:55
[Release notes 0.4.9.4](
* Add fix for unsupported payment methods
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:24:13
I don't think there is much to rescue.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:26:45
Yea, but it's a big exchange. :D
Oh damn, I didn't know that they copied the source code lmao. Well, that's what you get Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-19 07:58:56
Yea, they are awesome. I once converted ETC to ETH and accidentally sent the payment on both chains. They returned my ETH pretty quickly.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:46:43
Yes, 
@_date: 2016-08-26 14:21:58
Same, but the quality is "ok", the stitches were bad.
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:04:45
Exactly my thoughts, lmao.
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:59:58
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:57:08
Oh really? 3 Weeks, wow! On [this site]( it says that LocalBitcoins is Segwit-ready since 1 year already.
(not exactly on this site, but it was added there 1 year ago, check:  )
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:38:19
Segwit was advertised by Bitcoin Core Developers that it would solve the scaling problems and return cheap transactions to the users. To push this into the mind of everyone they used the list above which says that every business is already ready to use segwit or at least willing to add it.
Most of these services were listed one year ago already as "segwit-ready" but just started one month ago really using it. Everyone got tricked. I hope it's clear now.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:45:56
No, according to the list linked above ready means indeed fully implemented and ready to start using it. Not implemented is listed as WIP.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:50:35
Wow, finally someone gets my point. The f**king chart was a hoax to trick people into thinking "every" business wants segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:51:24
I'm waiting for the next big crash. :-)
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:56:56
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:20:46
So you mean the DDoS on mining pools signaling for BU and the BU website?
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:41:11
Yesterday everyone in this sub was so glad SW overtook BU in the last 144 blocks. It's variance bois. Relax your balls.
@_date: 2017-03-31 08:10:22
3 days from never is still never.
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:08:53
Just wait for the next difficulty increase in about 5 days. :)
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:10:49
That's not the end of the world guys, HODL!
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:41:20
Source please to confirm your claims.
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:15:31
How blind are you? Of course the fees decrease when less people are using bitcoin.
Maybe this graph helps you: 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:19:18
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:13:51
hover with your cursor over "bitcoin:master"
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:53:42
Yea and all the core nodes get kicked out of the network with their minority chain.
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:51:22
Hashrate is increasing every day for BU, doesn't matter what propaganda you spread here.
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:34:23
That's why we add emergent consensus to bitcoin core. (hint: BitcoinEC)
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:09:46
BitFury signals for segwit. I wouldn't make them angry otherwise segwit signaling drops to &lt;15%.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:44:11
@_date: 2017-01-23 07:49:22
Blocks are coming in slowly.
@_date: 2017-01-14 11:50:30
Great, they wasted their time implementing features that will never activate.
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:11:45
Alternative bitcoin clients are not "scam".
@_date: 2016-11-25 22:10:04
Thanks AntPool.
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:44:55
Thanks for your comment. +1
@_date: 2016-11-29 11:50:34
You are blind.
@_date: 2016-12-30 08:39:39
AntPool will not support SegWit until there is a block size increase included. So SegWit ain't gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:14:53
Just like BTC?
@_date: 2019-04-28 08:16:38
Too bad Lightning has too low liquidity for such sums.
@_date: 2017-04-13 17:27:24
Perfect, then we can focus on real scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-04-23 08:28:47
What's so special about this? When the companies tell you that they support BU they'll get attacked as shown in the past.
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:55:27
Wow what a great currency when you only got low fees on the weekend...
@_date: 2017-04-19 18:33:38
Wait about 12hours and you can post the same for BU...
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:52:54
In what world do you live?
@_date: 2016-09-12 19:37:34
I'd like to see this in a future version of bitcoin core.
@_date: 2016-09-20 09:02:00
Use this link: 
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:56:39
especially Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:05:39
Nope, please stick with 1MB.
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:57:15
This guy is full of shit.
@_date: 2016-09-20 14:43:47
Yea, an automatic redirect would be useful.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:16:50
This guy is full of shit.
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:48:53
Here use this free transaction accelerator: 
@_date: 2016-10-02 07:15:19
Too sad this site requires you to disable your adblocker, would have tried it otherwise.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:49:25
BU is blocking segwit!!1 /s
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:15:53
Well, he's right on that.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:48:01
Open your eyes, BIP148 will be a total disaster. Can't wait for 1st August to see your nodes leave the majority chain.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:52:24
Why below? It's not even at 14 at the moment. It's at 9 and was never higher.
Check this page: 
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:34:48
I wish I was... here is more about this recent change: 
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:38:34
Just like the majority of this sub too.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:32:41
No, you can thank the Core Developers for changing the expiry date of unconfirmed transactions to 2 weeks in the latest version.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:14:13
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:45:55
Because it is broken.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:51:09
Requires adobe flash? For real?
@_date: 2017-05-13 19:54:26
You guys are so stupid upvoting this. It's only unsafe in case of a rollback of the softfork which is unlikely to happen on litecoin.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:29:24
How to fork-off to a minority chain. Step by step guide please.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:44:48
LOL your stalking me?
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:30:34
Congrats bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:08:55
See you on the minority chain later!
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:18:58
Segwit will never activate on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:34:43
What the fuck?
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:56:53
This is going in the wrong direction.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:27:12
No, he is right.
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:28:52
Yea, fuck BIP-148
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:42:36
Why don't you ask it on the litecoin sub?
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:34:33
The first few blocks after the new 2MB limit is set will be full, because the transaction backlog has to be cleared. Once that's done and transactions come in at a lower number than 14 TPS the blocks won't be full again soon.
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:07:16
Make sure to transfer your BTC away from exchanges that support UASF.
@_date: 2016-07-27 23:17:08
I wasn't that wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:37:43
Stop these personal attacks.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:15:33
Can you finally stop with this UASF nonsense or do I have to read it until a few days after 1st August when it turned out to be a non-event?
@_date: 2016-07-11 12:58:42
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:43:59
BU blocking segwit!!1 /s
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:46:16
Would you bet on what you write here?
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:44:54
I second this!
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:53:35
Bitcoin became unusable so people switched to other crypto currencies.
@_date: 2016-07-29 19:10:32
Did the same last week! Finally.
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:25:25
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:50:38
WOHOOOOO!!! Happy halvening fellow bitcoiners!
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:08:48
Not afraid, I think you can simply ignore this UASF bullshit.
@_date: 2016-07-29 15:21:22
You can use  to pay your bills.
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:52:15
It's the transaction fees.
See here: 
Seems like blockchain.info is bugged with rewards at 12.5 btc, it even shows negative fees.
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:25:14
You can continue to repeat this lie until 1st August. See you on the minority chain!
