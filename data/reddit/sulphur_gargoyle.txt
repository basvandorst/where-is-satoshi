I don't know, I think Bitcoin's going to lead to the greatest wealth disparity we've ever seen due to Satoshi's coins.  In the scenario where one Bitcoin becomes valued at $100,000 current USD, Satoshi becomes worth about $100 billion USD.  (Realistically, he's already probably a paper billionaire.)  There's even a scenario where he becomes worth half a trillion dollars.  That's unprecedented wealth disparity, comparable to the sum fortune of the top 10 richest people in the world right now.
That kind of money will literally let you buy political systems.  The interesting thing for me, being from the same basic culture as Satoshi, is how likely am I to benefit from what he decides to do at that point?
Realistically, the best-case scenario is that the private keys for Satoshi's fortune have been lost, or distributed in some sort of treasure hunt that hasn't yet come to light.  $500 billion is too much power for one person to wield responsibly.  Even $100 billion is pushing it.

I don't like either of those. Or crowds.

Bitcoin's likelihood of being the reserve currency of the future is exactly why I finally got in seriously (sadly, I have a transaction from the Bitcoin Fountain on Feb 1, 2011, but no new ones until 2013; it was just a novelty at the time).
The United States has lost substantial popularity in the recent years.  The economic problem is the United States can just decide "Hey, you know that debt denominated in dollars?  Yeah, we have all the dollars we need to pay that off."  Switching to another country's currency leads to the same problem:  If the yuan is now the world's reserve currency, China can decide to cancel their debt through inflationary policies.  So may as well stick with the devil you know.
What's needed is some sort of something that can be exchanged with others, can't be forged, and has a guaranteed finite supply.  It would be even better if that finite supply would enter the supply in an evenly distributed manner.
Bitcoin is going to be the end of the US's ability to throw their economic weight around because it's likely to displace the dollar as the world's reserve currency.

Hail, hail, Bitcoinia... 
A land I didn't make up!

I'm embarrassed to say that I panic sold part of my holdings (thankfully, at a small profit).  It was then that I realized I had too much in there.  I've now reduced but not eliminated my holdings to a level that I can write off 100%, so I'm going to start ignoring Bitcoin news except as an academic interest.

My prediction is that the ultimate name of the Bitcoin unit is going to be "Sats," a shortened version of "Satoshi."  Millibitcoins seem likely to be shorted to "Mibs," while μBTC would be "Mics."

Dude, you're doing it wrong. Compound interest is your best friend here. All the value of Bitcoin comes from scarcity, and as more people enter the relative scarcity rises, but that doesn't compound, it degenerates. 
The first step is to start saving money. I target 25% savings. Hit up for that. Roommates, if you don't have them, or a cheaper place. Personally, I like to cut corners on food; milk, eggs, flour, rice, beans, and potatoes are stupid cheap, and chicken or certain fish (tuna, tilapia) are good, cheap protein sources. (Milk's not bad, either.) Coupon the crap out of everything. That probably won't get you to 25%, but it will get you to more than you are now. 
Now get some investments; Bitcoin's done really well, but past performance is no indication of future returns. Though it still has a ways to go. Diversify! I like the Vanguard target retirement funds, but there are cheaper options since they're just adaptive combinations of other Vanguard funds. Mine mostly go into a Roth IRA, since my current job doesn't have a 401(k). The rest is a simple brokerage account. 
Yeah, you'll need a job for a while, but most people do.

This time, yes! Not last time. Last time was a mistake. But an affordable mistake, since I panic sold before it finished its beating.

I had fun once and it was awful.

Why do you need accredited-investor-like returns?
