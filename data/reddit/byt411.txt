The majority of the votes does not represent 100% of everyone's opinion. You are too simple-minded.
If we were to vote, how would the voting work? Signing up? Bots can just repeatedly sign up and fake the vote results.
Bitcoin isn't about doing what the majority of people wants. That's the parliament. Bitcoin is about decentralization, and minding your own business, and also suffer the consequences if you fail to do so.
Please step out from your state-induced comfort zone. We are human beings, not fluffy pets in a cage.

No it is not and it makes no sense at all, being able to rent big data centers does not mean you can control a mining pool.

As the user above stated correctly, the funds were stolen by an attacker, not by JustCoin. Also, we take security very seriously, and all of our original security implementations on [ANXPRO]( will also be implemented on JustCoin.

No problem. I am constantly on reddit, and if I see any problems with ANXPRO I will forward it to tech support.
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:06:58
First, paying double the fee does not mean the tx will confirm twice as fast. You need to do more reading.
Second, the blockchain.info node screws up txs sometimes. Don't use blockchain.info, download a wallet, and in needed, get the raw tx and rebroadcast it elsewhere.

Hi! [ANXPRO]( here. Yes, we are a decent team, and we are one of the few exchanges that has never been hacked.
@_date: 2014-06-09 00:11:04
Agreed. Don't even suggest crap if you don't know how it works, you can't just stop a pool from mining, you can't just ban them. Even if you could, they can just sign the blocks with a different name.
The whole point of Bitcoin is to be decentralized, stop posting crap.
@_date: 2014-07-11 03:12:52
Unfortunately, that was my mistake, and the btc is converted when you load the card, and not at the time of the swipe. We will implement this feature at a later date.

@_date: 2014-06-08 18:44:08
Doesn't necessarily have to be true. For all I know, ghash could be paying another pool to sign their blocks for them, and hiding their hashrate.
@_date: 2014-09-30 22:04:44
As a half hongkonger, I really appreciate you posting this, so that more people can know about what we're doing.
@_date: 2014-07-30 04:26:35
Hi Patrick. The function of sending BTC via email is to send it to people that are new to Bitcoin and don't have a BTC Wallet. That way, it doesn't require setup and complication.
@_date: 2014-07-04 14:13:37
Its not true. Its a story, a theoretical assumption on what could happen, and that is true.
@_date: 2014-07-07 01:20:38
Spainard here too. It is fake.
Well, theres something similar, its that if you store your money at a bank, you get interest, and also transaction fees for the interest. Interest =0.05% of money, tx fees 0.1% of all your money.
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:47:45
Well no, you don't. Please don't verbally attack people like that, a lot of people don't have that much money and they can be hurt by you talking like that. Besides, he's a 14 year old kid.

No, he sold his account on Bitcointalk to a troll.
@_date: 2014-06-15 01:01:24
It's quite easy. You simply prepare the contract, and then SHA-256 hash the contract. You take that hash and you use it as a private key to an address. Send bitcoins to that address, and also sign a message with the private key.
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:22:21
You mean as in disrupt the exchanges?

@_date: 2014-05-12 18:16:37
Well, the price can go up, and that's a good thing, and it can go down, so its also a bad thing.
@_date: 2014-07-11 09:09:39
How is it that bad? And the fees are only 2.5%. Compare that to:
1. Exchange BTC to fiat.
2. Withdraw fiat to bank account.
3. Spend funds using credit/debit card through bank account.

As a user and customer's point of view, I would suggest adding at least the best coins from each algorithm. For example, VertCoin from scrypt-N, and Darkcoin from x11.
I also suggest that you only require address verification for low trading limits, like Kraken does. A lot of people, including me, don't like to give their ID online.

@_date: 2014-05-07 06:48:52
What you are saying makes no sense at all.
Something worthless into something of true value?
Do you know why something has value? Because people believes it does. Gold is just metal. "Money" are just sheets of paper.
@_date: 2014-10-18 10:40:07
@_date: 2014-09-10 15:35:54
It means that many people will quit mining because it will no longer be profitable. It possibly means that Bitcoin price will rise due to lowered supply.

In what way, shape or form is that pathetic?
@_date: 2014-05-09 06:41:52
I actually think that the one ANX did was very interesting, since the public got a chance to learn about bitcoin, and its not just normal fiat money.

I suggest [ANX]( Low fees, and extremely secure.
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:21:07
May I ask what is wrong with being Chinese?

Try [ANXPRO]( supports SEPA and has fees as low as 0.05%.
@_date: 2014-06-09 00:18:20
I dunno what you mean, its just a thing by my superiors to check how much engagement I've made.
Btw, nice name.
@_date: 2014-05-27 07:19:52
That sounds like a ponzi, lol.
@_date: 2015-05-27 22:02:46
Wrong. You have to leave your bitcoins/balance on BitStamp. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:52:35
Umm.. Because they all have different hashrates?
Don't worry, you can earn 0.0001 per miner per day, just send all the extra to me.
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:48:44
Nice idea! We will consider that.
@_date: 2014-06-24 22:26:44

ANX Customer Support here. Our debit card has no transaction fees on the customer.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:47:53
Lol ok. First of all, I haven't downvoted or upvoted any of your comments.
As to your question, that would be because if it isn't a donation and it is an actual lottery, it would be governed by many complicated laws and the winner would have to pay taxes.
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:07:30
1. What you would have to do is deposit the bitcoins into your ANX account, and then load them onto the card. The conversion rate is displayed every time you load it, and if you are dissatisfied with the price, you can choose to not load.
2. Nope. Please see the method above.
3. Hmmm. I'm not sure, I think that you can only load with btc right now. I'll check and get back to you.
4. Again, I'm not sure. But if you just want to sell Bitcoins, that isn't usually the case, since if the price rises a little someone will buy your coins. 
5. Its probably due to our not-so-great volume.
6. We charge a very low trading fee. We don't profit from spreads.
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:06:10
Again, we are primarily a Premier Bitcoin Exchange, and we make money from trading fees.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:28:30
Yes, I'm sure many people would be glad to know that by simple donating $1 they have a chance to make someone a millionaire. Yes, the money starts going in after the winner is chosen.
You have no obligation to donate, and you can be an asshole if you want to. The winner is in control of the money.
Imo, you really should stop being selfish and thinking that this is ridiculous. The attitude you wrote your comment in clearly indicates that you are so. Please take a moment and think about it; $1 is nothing. Does it really matter that much if you donate it?
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:21:13
What you have stated is correct, and it also works for online payments.
Our Bitcoin Debit Card actually launched months ago, and it has been featured on many news sites, such as CoinDesk, CryptoCoinsNews, and CoinTelegraph.
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:19:45
Hello. ANX support here. When you are using the ANXBTC platform, what you have stated may be the case, since it matches you with the next best buy/sell order on the market. However, if you use the ANXPRO platform, you can place limit orders and set it at your desired price.
If you have any other questions, please don't hesistate to ask.
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:08:41
Yes, it's available now.
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:10:31
Our debit card has NO FEES for the customer. If the bill is $15.45, you pay $15.45. The money on the debit card is stored in USD, so your btc is exchanged when you load the card. There might be a small spread difference, but we aren't profiting from that, that is due to the market orders. 
Depositing btc to an ANX account has no fees.

If needed, yes. We aren't an exchange, and we don't even hold any customer funds. at all. So yes, we are prepared.
We believe that decentralization is key, and our services are built upon this foundation.
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:09:03
No KYC at all. The receiving address is generated via split key generation, with the sender and Blockonomics each only having a part of the private key.
Blockonomics emails their part of the private key to the receiver as a redeem code, while the sender provides theirs as a redeeming link.
@_date: 2015-04-04 18:00:39
Nope. You can only purchase it ingame from the game company, Riot Games, and spend it in the game.
@_date: 2015-04-04 18:01:04
People actually did, and Riot Games (the game company) refunded them, since it was supposed to be an April Fool's joke.
@_date: 2015-04-04 04:29:16
They are basically avatars. RP is a currency that is bought with real money for the game, and for example, 10€ will get you like 1820RP or something like that. As you can see, 99999RP is a ridiculous amount, and they did this for April Fools. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 19:27:40

I understand that. I was merely pointing out that you shouldn't try Neteller if you hope for anonimity. Also, that their customer support is quite unprofessional.

I never said it was shitty. I was pointing out that Neteller shouldn't be used for anonimity, since your account will get frozen. Also, that their customer support is unprofessional.

It is impossible because The bitcoin protocol cannot differentiate coins from different  inputs combined together which have formed a single output. 
I don't know if you mean physical coins that carries a virus or what, but bitcoins cannot carry viruses.

My account got frozen immediately after I deposited with bitcoin and I attempted a transaction. Check out what support told me:

It is more logical to simply buy btc with fiat than buying mining equipment and trying to mine.

None. It was simply a ponzi that claimed to invest in bitcoin, but there is no proof of that.

A lot of people are downvoting me because they believe that i think that I am hating just because, and that I think that there must be no verification if there is bitcoin. 
I'm not thinking that. Point is, why does using Bitcoin constitute an immediate freeze on your account? If you don't use Bitcoin, you aren't forced to verify.

So in the fork, essentially, the stolen eth can basically be removed and put under another address? 
@_date: 2016-07-21 13:02:39
Thanks! Is there any specific reason behind this kind of system, or not?

Could anyone elaborate on this? Not trolling, just haven't studied in depth how ethereum works.
