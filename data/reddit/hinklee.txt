The point is your hash rate overtime will not generate the same profit overtime and eventually it will be almost nothing at all and will not be able to come up with enough bitcoin to cover electricity costs, which then will result in Genesis removing your contract. Because its "Lifetime" until its not profitable anymore.

You don't understand that as competition for bitcoin increases and soon enough your 1TH as a example will not produce .01 BTC every month. It will continue to produce less and less every single month because of competition and sooner or later your 1TH won't even produce enough to cover the electricity costs it takes to run which your contract will then be removed.

Haha, it doesn't matter how long I've been in this the point is that anyone with half of a brain has to know this is a scam. I haven't just "figured the whole game" out this week.

To do what they're doing they literally don't need to sell any legit hash power. All they have to do is to be able to give out profit for the first couple months then after that the buyers contract is worthless so they cancel it and take the money

You'll make money for a while but in the end your contract will be worthless.

You would think that yet I see people everyday dump thousands of dollars into this.

You need to get your head checked if you are actually being serious.

Who said I though it was a get rich easy scheme, If you understand that it produces less bitcoins overtime you should be able to conclude this is a scam. Them stating the word "Lifetime" makes people think that they will be able to make really good money overtime from there initial investment even though in the end there hash power will be almost nothing in a year.
