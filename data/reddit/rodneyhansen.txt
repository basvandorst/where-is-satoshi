Still trying to understand Bakkt here, but aren’t they buying now to hopefully sell later at a lower price thus signaling they believe the price will be going lower?  Just trying to figure out why ath are celebrated in Bakkt futures... thx.

That’s all I was looking for was someone calling out the bullshit. But Wow, such empty.

This might seem like a stupid question but is a hardware wallet is same as cold storage/ proof of keys?

I can’t find any info on it!

Captured it beautifully. ����

That’s the only article apparently, guess it’s bullshit until proven.

I was looking for a previous discussion on it as well and had a hard time finding anything. Even if it is bullshit I expected a large thread calling that out. Did I miss something?

Cool reading up on those. Looks like most of those notes were all tied to commodities though?

Bitcoin is gold. Ethereum is cash. :)

I’m still learning about how Bakkt works, but if people purchase futures contracts, are those contracts visible to the public? And do those contracts effect the blockchain at all before the contracts close?
