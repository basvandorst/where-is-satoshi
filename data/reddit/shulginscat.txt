This is the part I don't understand. Can we get a video interview / feature to see who these people are and what their use for BTC is?

He's fucked right?

... what then?

So I've checked out multisig in Coinkite. It looks nice but I'm trying to figure out ease-of-use. Consider that an average customer will purchase from several different vendors, possibly with different arbiters each time. In that scenario, and using Coinkite, would I have to create a new "shared account" for each purchase? (each combination of 3 people)

What is the problem?

Which multisig-capable client can run on TAILS without a painful setup?
Electrum 2.0 has a weird way of doing multisig that I don't understand. It seems that the 3 wallets need to be created at the same time.. I'm looking for something that is more appropriate for the customer-vendor model, where you could just send funds directly from your 1xx address to a newly created 3xx address and sign/broadcast transactions directly from the app.
Also, a $25 donation to the person who's willing to write a noob-level guide on how to do this for @_date: 2015-03-19 21:50:47


Conceptually I understand that each P2SH address can correspond to only one set of signers (buyer, vendor, arbiter) - but my gripe is the UI here. I really wish it was a simple one-click operation I could do from my own 1xx wallet.

Does coinkite work over Tor? I see that they're using cloudflare and that has been causing problems for me in the past. It seems to be javascript-heavy as well, and I'm a big fan of noscript over Tor. But I'll give it a shot. 


Obviously that would be retarded because then I could just sign any transaction and take the coins. What I'm saying is it's clunky because of what said:


That's a little bit annoying. Is there a way in Electrum to create a 3xx address on my regular wallet, using specific external pubkeys for each multisig?

I see. Thanks for the response. It just seemed so weird that (1) He could have admitted privacy interest in the server without that being used against him in court (although I'm not sure how you would prove interest in such a case), (2) his line of defense was that Ross started SR anyway so he basically did admit there was interest albeit maybe not at the time of seizure, and (3) the judge basically warned him that he his submitting an impossible motion and yet he proceeded with it. It's not like he was caught "on the spot" and had to make a swift decision one way or the other...  Or am I seeing this wrong?

If I transfer money from a bank account I own in EUR to my bank account here in the US, via bitcoin, will I have to pay taxes on it?
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:57:10
That process is unavoidable, but I wish the UI was more friendly. See my above comment

Electrum 2.0 introduced the multisig wallets, which are nice but a little bit clunky IMO. My ideal implementation would be a sub-menu under my regular 1xx Electrum wallet that would let me create/sign/broadcast multisig transactions with pubkeys from my 1xx addresses. 
Eventually, I stumbled on [a bitcointalk post]( from a guy who developed such a plugin about 1yr ago, and he had this to say:


It's not apparent to me why this is a security risk/leak, as he seems to imply. Can someone please explain the drawback? Or alternatively why the wallet separation a la Electrum 2 is actually better?

Can you see any reasonable explanation as to why he would not express Ross's interest in the server's content for the 4a hearing?
