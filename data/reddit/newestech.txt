This is a very good point but let me clear that up for you-
A little comparison may help,Global Payments one of the largest worldwide providers of payment solutions, announced January 24th an agreement to acquire Payment Processing, Inc. (PayPros) for $420,000,000 
Pay Pros is a credit card processing company that has been in business for 20 yrs and has 58,000 merchants on their platform.
Bitpay, after 2 years has 21,000 merchants on their platform 
The initial seed funding for Bitpay in 2013 was in the millions and was paid back to investors within 6 months with a 600% return. 
All indications point to blue skies ahead!!!!

The point of sale application is Microsoft Dynamics Retail Management System (RMS) and the Wallet used is Mycelium.

Our Bitpay integration takes seconds, in most cases it is faster than a Credit Card Authorization. We posted a Youtube link above if you want to see it action.

It is now fixed!

Here is a link to a video post that shows it in action-

Good point. Thanks for the feedback.

You are right, it is a very fragmented space which makes it  difficult to come up with a number.

That's not quite how it works, at least in our application that is integrated with a point of sale system (Microsoft Dynamics RMS). We wrote it to call out to Bitpay at the end of the transaction and lock the rate in. Meaning that the customer will be charged the exact amount of BC at the time of transaction and the retailer will receive the exact amount of USD at the time of transaction. The liability due to fluctuating value of BC is absorbed by Bitpay. This is how instant authorizations are possible.

Thank you! We are pretty excited about it. I'm curious, why would you prefer to use a card or nfc device?

We have put out a really efficient version of an integrated POS tender process for Bitcoin
See it here 
Love to hear thoughts and comments and answer any questions.

Sounds good!

They sure have, we literally just released this and currently we have Swissa Jewelers in Seattle Washington ( as well as Brewligans in Troutdale Oregon with MANY more on the way. The cool thing about Swissa is they are using Nitrosell (an integrated ecommerce and shopping cart software for RMS) and they are accepting Bitcoin through their ecomm site.

The only applicable fee is the standard Bitpay transaction fee, we do not charge anything additional.

It will work in Canada with a few tweaks. Shoot us a message and we can talk through it.
