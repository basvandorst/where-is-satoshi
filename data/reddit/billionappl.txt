Anybody want to test another wallet for iOS? We are nearing the App Store release and currently in an open Test Flight beta. We call it [Billion](Billionapp.org) — it has BIP147 Payment Codes support (hi there Samurai brothers) and quite a slick UI! Segwit will be released in February ‘18. Drop us an email to get an invite!beta

Yeah, Billion is the first iOS Payment Code implementation. Not that it is any harder to implement on iOS, BIP-47 is rather young proposal itself. We are early adopters.
You can help us improve our product by applying for beta test. Just send us an email to beta

Payment code has an XPUB inside but you do not send coins to it’s addresses directly. That would expose your financial activity.
You generate unique addresses by combining an XPUB of your friend’s payment code with XPRIV of your own payment code. Only you and your friend will know actual addresses that way.

Public beta as of now. Drop a request here – billionapp.org (we'll invite you into both mainnet and testnet versions).

Help us built a wallet that will only call a Bitcoin as Bitcoin, no matter the height, no matter anything. Our [bitcointalk thread](
iOS only as of now. Early open beta.

Welcome! That is pretty cool tech. Imagine your friend use Samurai on Android and you use Billion on iOS. After tunnel is established you can exchange coins without *any* prior contact.

That is actually quite easy to verify. Here is a quote from [BIP-0047](




It is definitely a bit complicated topic. We now have on-chain transactions that open 'channels' for Lightning Network and here are 'tunnels' for BIP-0047 with on-chain transactions as well.

Billion will stick to a Bitcoin blockchain without regard to it’s height. It will ban S2X chain on a code level (the first S2X block hash will be blacklisted).
We are in an early open beta stage and we need beta testers to gather feedback. [Join us]( if you have an iPhone running iOS 10 or 11.
P. S. Nice username brother

And there is a wallet for that — [billionapp.org]( 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:12:47
it was proposed ( as a symbol for satoshis [some time ago](

You can definitely propose ( to use a circled katakana 'sa'. Up until now, only circled katakana 'shi' has been proposed.
edit: and no doubts "㋛" looks friendly, especially to newcomers.

once bitcoin is valuable 'enough' you still need to use zeros. With lightning it's likely we will use sub-satoshi units, so 'bits' won't be convenient.
