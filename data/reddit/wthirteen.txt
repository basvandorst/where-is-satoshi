You'll do good to remember to use the correct transaction fees! I made the mistake of withdrawing from exchange at 0.001 BTC fee while I wasnt aware of the network conditions, and it's been stuck every since. If only I could unstuck my transaction such as with the Ethereum network!

Does the transaction fee look too low to you for miners to pick it up on the block? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:34:15
LOL stay classy boy.

The network is overly congested now, I believe median fees are in the ballpark of 50 to even remotely be usable. Gotta get the transaction unstuck asap to move my BTC around!

That's rough. Thanks for the help tho, appreciate it!

No shit sherlock 
"I'll appreciate any help if someone can point me a direction of how I can get my funds unstuck from the blockchain!"

You're telling someone their problem, when they clearly know of it, and are looking for a solution. Should I be thanking you? 
If a fat person asks for tips to get in shape, should he/she thank you if you comment "You're fat!"

Yeah thats unfortunate, I just didnt wanna go through the hassle of double transferring especially if the blockchain is under heavy load right now.

Look just FYI I’m on this side of the ship too. 
But do you feel this warrants vigilante justice? Why be the petty one to retaliate in such manner? The way I interpret it I don’t see the malicious intent behind it as deceit. Perhaps it is, perhaps it isn’t. It takes a lot of energy to see everything through tinted glass.
Or is your idea of mature exchange them setting up posters saying “BTC: 95k unconfirmed transactions and counting”
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:20:52
Just in case this hasnt been said enough, this is incredibly childish and petty and only serves to portray the other side as martyrs

I have my doubts. You have been on reddit for 4 years and accumulated like 30 comment karma, and only just today started discussing Bitcoin? I just don't buy it, sorry. 
- Talked about my post history and what reddit means to me
How is it vigilante justice? It is literally someone cleaning up trash from the streets. Would you feel any different if the posters were using the Bitcoin logo, and described Bitcoin, while linking to the OneCoin scam? This is really the same thing, it's propaganda designed to misinform the reader into making investments into Bcash, thinking it's this new thing called Bitcoin that everyone is talking to.
- Talked about how I don't see it as a malicious intent to deceive. You have your interpretation, I have mine. If OneCoin explicitly said they are Bitcoin, its a different story altogether then. 
How is it not intentional deceit? Explain to me how someone posting flyers with the description of Bitcoin, using the Bitcoin logo and then trying to divert yo over to some altcoin page? It's textbook malicious intent to deceive.
I might have missed the big fat words "Bitcoin Cash" Oh wait I didn't
Mature exchange? You make it sound like we are two equal communities having an honest battle of opinions and fighting some equally just war. This is naive and harmful thinking. We are under attack and these people are using ever dirty trick in the book. We are trying to mitigate damage here, not inflict it. Why would we want any "exchange" with these Bcash scammers? We just want them to mind their own business and if they are honest about what Bcash is, then there is no problem. This was a blatant attempt to trick and defraud users, if you can't see that, maybe your moral compass needs a little tuning.
- Blowing everything out of proportion, textbook insecurity
You're not very good at this either. Goodbye.

*tinfoil fat on* Oh you caught me. I'm actually a secret spy sent to stir anarchy and discord among the Bitcoin community. 
Show me that OP has diligently picked up every scrap of litter he came across. Unless he has done so, "cleaning up trash" is just an excuse which serves to fit his own agenda. Just as much as this is a "good-willed debate". The intent is what matters, the truth can be twisted to be as convoluted as you want it to be. 
Yes, I've been on reddit for a long time, but not posted much. The way I see reddit, is a community where people are free to make their opinions known, shared. I take in the opinions presented, and use the information to learn and grow (be it in cryptocurrency subreddits, or games). That's what this is all about to me, a place for me to learn from people all around the world. Perhaps this does not sit right with you, and only people who have actively participated in discussions are allowed to have their opinions validated. Your version of the truth is not the only truth in the world.
All things said and done, it's my cue to exit. I'm just here to express my opinion that this is not the solution the cryptospace needs to get to mainstream adoption right now. Like it or not, I'll like the entire space to grow, be it BTC or other altcoins. Blockchain should serve to improve the lives of people and that's the big picture to me. This conversation has just served to shown me your insecurity and I'll prefer to not get into meaningless squabbles.
