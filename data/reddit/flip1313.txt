Bitcoin makes heavy use of the cryptographic hash function SHA256, which stands for Secure Hash **Algorithm** 256-bit

No wheels no self driving cars
No algorithm no bitcoin

So it’s disrespectful to give a nod to the inventor of algorithm? the set of instructions used to perform computations
Even tho we use and depend on his invention

they want 5,250,000 bitcoins (over five million)
even at todays price of $8,525 that would cost $44,756,250,000 or a bit over **44 billion**
imagine the slippage on that order 
**top 20 richest according to forbes 2019**
1) Jeff Bezos $131 billion
19) Steve ballmer $41.2 billion (19th on list)
no one person is rich enough to buy 25% of the market anymore the slippage would be insane and the richest of the rich in the world today only just have that net worth, never mind cash in a bank ready to buy

This is not public knowledge tho
Hence they will need cooperation from the exchange

Why won’t it work? 
Once you go into a exchange and move your coins from one private address to another private address this can not be followed on the blockchain you need cooperation from the exchange. With it being located in another jurisdiction it doesn’t fall under us law they don’t have to cooperate

Complete ignores what I said and rambles on about child porn
OK 
LOL really tho they have no obligation to provide any details to coinmama
Dear Hong Kong based exchange we was recently tracking all our customers coins to see where they was going and what they was being spent on when we have since noticed our customers send their bitcoin to your exchange could you please provide us with the transaction iD in and out of your 
PRIVATE COMPANY so we can keep on tracking them yours sincerely coinmama
What response do you think they will get? Completely None just get ignored

Step 1) buy bitcoins from any American exchange 
Step 2) move coins from exchange to private wallet 
Step 3) send coins to another exchange located in HONG KONG
step 4) exchange your bitcoins to any other coin (monero) any coin would work tho (you also don’t really need to exchange any coin)
Step 5) send your new coins to a new private wallet 
Step 6) send your coins to another exchange located in RUSSIA  
Step 7) exchange your coins back into bitcoins
Step 8) spend your bitcoins 
The odds of any American company being able to follow that path is slim to none. They would have to ask the HONG KONG authorities for cooperation to see what you exchanged your coins to, and what wallet it was then sent to. Then it goes to a Russian exchange. Again they would need to ask Russian authorities for cooperation
This is a old internet trick people used to keep illegal websites up and running. How much cooperation did the Hong Kong government provide in the arrest of Edward snowden? How much cooperation does the Russian government provide in the return of Edward snowden? 
Everytime you use a exchange in a different country you are subject to their local laws and no America laws apply to you and they have no authority over the exchanges at all 
Yes I no it’s a long process and their could be better ways but this would actually work the odds of all three countries working together to track you spending $50 on a poker website is laughable

incorrect for the UK we only pay tax on mined coins once we cash out. We pay tax at the point of sale 
(what ever price that is) not the price when the coin was issued to us


lol were are both right fs just checked again, they updated the policy 4 months ago
