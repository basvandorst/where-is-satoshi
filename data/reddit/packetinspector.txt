While sometimes more ignorant observers try to do that I don't think it happened here. What I think this interview shows is that people are getting a deeper understanding of bitcoin and understand that it is a ledger (the blockchain) and not just a currency.
When Levitt talks about the blockchain he describes how the miners, who validate the transactions, get paid in bitcoins i.e. he correctly links the two together. And with the interviewer, it's simply good to see her talking about the blockchain rather than just indulging in endless gossip about the price bubbling or tanking, as so many media types did up until recently.

Well, they did try to get her to expand more on what she meant by 'forensic journalism', in reply to which she mainly blathered. And they did try to get her to say exactly what was her evidence to which she merely replied that it was in the article. Of course, there is very little 'evidence' in the article. We don't have a proper record of the conversation between her and Dorian Nakamoto, (a conversation in which he was mostly just focused on getting her to leave his property as evidenced by his calling the police), and the rest of her argument is mostly just a 'he could be the guy'. Which seems to directly contradict her so-called method of 'forensic journalism' as much as I could understand it.

Your comments here are full of empty ideology.
It's not about a ‘planned economy’ or ‘artificial production limits’ (like OPEC). It's about *engineering constraints*; setting limits to make sure the software doesn't break.
I think most BU boosters like yourself have little experience in engineering where limits are introduced all the time to make sure things don't catastrophically break. The current block size limit is the same; it's there to make sure bitcoin's fundamental principle of security through decentralisation is maintained and not broken. You can throw all the empty ideological rhetoric you like against that. Real world constraints can be very accurately modeled to show that you're wrong.

You can't have “competing development teams” for a software project. It's a ridiculous idea. There is one development team and by a process of open, technical discussion and testing of ideas they move development forward.
If you want to support a ‘competing development team’ you fork the code and start a new project, i.e. an altcoin in the bitcoin world. That is what has always happened in the open source world if a group develops within a project that disagrees with the path the main development team is taking.
This is a *strength* of open source software - that someone can take the code and fork it. If you want to apply Balaji's quote to this situation then yes, open source always gives you a choice of new leaders by following them to a new project from a fork of the code.

Not sure how you perceive a disparate group of more than 50 developers spread out across the world who communicate in an open, transparent process as ‘centralised’.

They show that they serve and respect the community by not allowing hard changes to Bitcoin which have not achieved consensus support. That is the only way to serve the community *as a whole*. Arrogantly forcing hard forks on the community when there isn't consensus does not serve the whole community and centralises power by making for ‘winners’ and ‘losers’.

Core will put out a proposal for a hard fork and allow a good amount of time for discussion and to test whether there is consensus for it to be implemented. Without consensus it won't be implemented.

Agree that the upvoting appears to have been severely manipulated. 


He didn't just speak out in favour of a blocksize hardfork (which is his right, although he should have shown a lot more discretion). People, including me, are thoroughly pissed off at him for directly attacking the bitcoin developers and running ‘technical’ arguments against them that were naive and frankly, an embarrassment to him (the infamous ‘multiple browsers analogy’ slideshow). The guy proved himself a fool and a dishonourable fool; frankly I'm not surprised at the backlash that's now coming his way and to his very closely identified company.

VC's invest in startups in return for equity. It's highly unlikely that Armstrong together with his co-founder still hold anything like 50% of the company.

You should always be very careful about arguing from analogy, especially when it is a technical argument. This analogy has all kinds of obvious errors in it and false equivalences.

This is a change in attitude for me as I was initially quite critical of the moderation (and still think it was done fairly clumsily at first and without a well-written justification).

Consider these points:
1. Without this ‘shitstorm’ the bitcoin price would almost definitely be higher
2. But if bitcoin is really facing an existential demise due to the scary “fee event” most people would be trying to sell and the price would have gone much lower
3. However, as you yourself have found, there is still good buying demand at a fairly high price compared to six months ago when the shitstorm really started to kick in. Why do people continue to want to buy?
4. There is some relief from current capacity pressure coming in two months. Furthermore, this relief is being thoroughly tested before release and the people who crafted it have an excellent track record. Finally, it comes in the form of a soft fork which would be much easier to wind back in the unlikely event that problems were found in it once deployed.
@_date: 2016-03-07 09:09:29


No, if you pay the right fee (still only cents) then your transactions will continue to go through with no wait. Only people who are free-riding on a resource that needs to be limited to keep the key principle of a decentralised system intact will find things no longer so easy for them.

I don't mean to be rude as I may have said something similar in the early days but those of us who represented the value of bitcoin in this way were wrong. The free or almost free cost of money transfer early on was simply an artifact of the unused capacity available early on (when bitcoin was still proving itself).
The real value in bitcoin is being able to send value freely (not for free) without outside (authoritarian) control and also in being able to store value free from state interference (and inflation of the money supply).
Now what you wanted from bitcoin and the value you represented it in having may be able to be provided by a service built on top of bitcoin (like Lightning). No those services don't exist yet. But bitcoin *can't* provide the (almost) free money transmission solution you want at scale, so wanting it to do so, now that it is so much more popular, is unrealistic, and, *if* you support people like Ver who falsely promise this service to you, ultimately destructive to the real value of bitcoin that I described above.

I'm not saying they're not different businesses. I'm pointing out the fallacy that bitcoin needs any particular exchange to survive (and grow). That fallacy was shown to be demonstrably  false when MtGox, which had a huge share of the exchange business, spectacularly imploded and bitcoin lived on (although with reputation diminished for those with a shallow understanding of the difference between the bitcoin project and external exchanges).
Exchanges are, for now, a *necessary evil* in the bitcoin ecosystem. The idea that we should let their business priorities interfere with the safe maintenance and development of the bitcoin project is, from where I'm sitting, a crazy one and goes against what I understand to be the philosophy of the project.
I think the Classic boosters have made a big mistake in letting Brian Armstrong take such a prominent role in their hype and manufactured panic campaign. It's not like Coinbase has ever been tremendously popular with the bitcoin community. And Brian Armstrong is proving himself to be a very hot-headed and politically reckless campaigner who has now made what seems to me to be a very serious mistake in directly attacking [the people who have worked very hard]( to keep bitcoin running over the years and are doing careful and considered work in innovating bitcoin's development and expansion.

Bitcoin cannot scale to reach mainstream adoption by simply increasing block size. (You seem to acknowledge this in your next sentence.)

Two reasons:
1. confidence and thus price was suppressed for a long time because of political drama
2. positive feedback loop when demand increases against a completely inelastic supply

*It's not good enough*. This controversy has become an offensive joke and this is now what needs to happen:
* needs to resign. He's eternally compromised as a mod now.
* The censorship decision needs to be reversed. A very large majority of the community do not agree with the decision. A mod team *cannot hold out* against the majority of its community, as they still need to hold trust and good will within that community. That trust and good will is *rapidly* disappearing
* After has resigned, the rest of the mods who have supported censorship campaign need to recognise they were wrong and apologise for their actions. That might then help to rebuild trust and good will.

The judicial concept of *habeas corpus* was an exceedingly important development in Libertarian philosophy and practice. It is something we should fight for and protect very strongly, especially as it is coming under increasing pressure in modern times.
Interestingly, TIL that there was a similar judicial tradition in Polish-Lithuanian law called *Neminem captivabimus*, short for *neminem captivabimus nisi iure victum*, (Latin, "We shall not arrest anyone without a court verdict"), which dates from the 1400s. However it was extinguished in the 1700s. A historical warning that we cannot take the principle for granted.

This is meaningless bullshit and sophistry. No, not everything is 'political'. If you're building a bridge and someone wants to make a design change and you point out that the change will compromise the structural integrity of the bridge (using rigourous, expert analysis and modeling) are you being 'political' for pointing out the flaw and the risk? No. It only gets political if your expert warning is ignored and the change is pushed through. In other words, it's entirely possible for only one side (your word) to be playing politics. Especially when it's most likely just bluffing and brinkmanship.  
\* Edit to add: Engineers make technical compromises all the time. They don't, or shouldn't, make political compromises. The blocksize limit is a (necessary) technical compromise. BU wants to remove it and replace it with political compromises ("emergent consensus", voting). This in itself is very revealing of the motives and worldview of its promoters.

Reflection of solar back into space is a factor sure. And no, I wasn't counting geothermal. Both good points.
Looking at wind, there's no energy sink for wind. With energy sinks for solar (i.e. plants and the food chain built upon them) we're not really putting solar panels in places where they remove solar energy availability for plants. We've still got a hell of a lot of roof space to cover (both domestic and industrial). There's also huge expanses of desert to cover. I think this will be a minimal concern for a long time.

Your comment indicates that you do not appreciate a major difference between energy sourced from fossil fuels and energy from renewablesources. Renewable energy generated from solar and wind comes directly and indirectly (wind) from solar inputs to our atmosphere. It is energy *that has already entered Earth's system*. Photo-voltaics trap that energy and convert it to electricity which ultimately gets redistributed as heat. Wind generation comes from solar energy heating the atmosphere and wind turbines pull the energy from this solar heating out of the atmosphere (by converting the wind energy to electricity). So there is *no net gain* of energy (heat) from when we trap some of the always incoming solar energy and convert it into another form.
Energy from fossil fuels is different. It comes from solar but from solar energy from many thousands of years ago which has been buried and fossilised under the earth's crust. By burning that, we add to the regular daily input of solar by rapidly releasing solar energy that was collected millennia ago and not previously re-released.
So in summary, even as we grow the use of renewables by orders of magnitude that renewable energy use will not result in more release of heat into the atmosphere *because that was energy that had already entered our atmosphere whether we converted it or not.*

You're missing the point; they're arguing this philosophically, not from the ‘correctness’ of a broken legal system.
Why can a man *who has not been charged* be locked up? There was an arrest warrant for Assange but without a charge being made against him in Sweden. As Assange pointed out in his speech yesterday, the UK has since changed the law so that they will not credit EU arrest warrants when there is no charge made against the person by the country which served the arrest warrant. It was a broken system when Assange was held. The UK have recognised that by changing their laws. The UN found that Assange was illegally being deprived of his freedom.
Assange was on bail when he walked into an embassy to seek asylum. Do bail conditions mean that you can't seek asylum? Of course not. The right to seek asylum is absolute.

All that he should report is that someone is claiming to have come up with a mathematical proof, that another mathematician was satisfied by the proof, *but that the proof still needs to go through a process of peer review and verification*.
This journalist was conned and allowed his position of influence as a writer at the BBC to be used to mislead the general public. He should face disciplinary action or be sacked. And the BBC should put forward a public apology for the misleading journalism they published on their site.

Not what I said. What I said is that the signed businesses think they can push an ill considered, and what would turn out to be a contentious hard fork on the bitcoin user base by linking it to something that is greatly desired: activation of Segwit. That is an attempted political power play. If we allow these sorts of corporate sponsored political machinations to succeed then we will move to a process of development by corporate control, rather than by technical merit. And bitcoin will then die.

People are ‘shitting’ all over Gavin because he's amply demonstrating that he's never understood the ethos and philosophy behind bitcoin. That it is a trustless system that doesn't rely on appeals to authority. Instead he keeps on promoting himself as an authority and suggesting that if *he* was privately convinced by Wright then the rest of us should trust in his judgement. When the very technology that is the subject of debate provides a simple, trustless way for its creator to clearly identify themselves to the world.
Gavin is only further proving himself a (dangerous) fool who should be ignored.

It makes no *technical* sense to link a 2MB hard-fork to segwit activation. This is a political move which I personally reject. The listed companies have indicated that segwit merits activation, they should simply go ahead and signal for that and then make the case separately for a 2MB hard fork if they want to. Linking the two together is an arrogant attempt at a political power play towards the corporate control of bitcoin.

Erik, to put it frankly, whatever you ‘felt’ really doesn't matter much, despite your obviously thinking it does and thinking you have the right to express ‘disappointment’ on twitter - and it playing well to the rabid crowd on This post is the ‘sound and thoughtful reasoning’ and it came out within an adequate period of time to explain the decision. Maybe you could, and should,  have waited just a couple of days before publicly throwing more crap at the solid people who quietly advance the bitcoin project?
What's happening in the bitcoin world is that some of the people who jumped in early, but have since their early entry showed they very much have feet of clay, are being shaken out as their less than stellar track records start to speak for themselves. While the solid people, who have simply done good work for the benefit of the whole community and not become victims of their inflated egos, have worked on in the background. People like the author of this post. But it's becoming quite obvious that you're part of the former group, not the latter, and so really, you can have whatever ‘feelings’ you like but the reality is that less and less people are going to give them any notice whatsoever. Time's up, old chap. You've had your 15 minutes of fame. It's unseemly to hang on to it when you mostly won it by accident.

No one voice represents bitcoin. Bitcoin belongs to all of us. And in a variety of voices it's important to have someone like Amir. Especially as an antidote to someone like Gavin.

Or, you know, Gavin could have just waited for CSW to publish his ‘evidence’ and taken advantage of the general scrutiny by the bitcoin community before offering his own opinion. Instead, he chose to participate in a tightly scheduled and stage-managed ‘reveal’. He was credulous and foolish and that *does* impact his reputation, especially when you consider it in the context of his [less than stellar track record.](
I haven't yet seen an acknowledgement from him that he was conned. The best he's offered today is “Ask me how I feel in six months”. Well, I'd personally be happy not to hear anything from him in the next six months or however long it takes to admit that he was once again ‘bamboozled’.

You're joking but I think this was a small indication of his talent. He was asked to move a small amount of the coins he claimed to have (as Satoshi). But he turned it around and got his marks to give him small amounts of money first (which he was then supposed to return as proof of access to the addresses holding Satoshi's coins). Of course he didn't, but the way he got his marks to commit to doing something *first* - and thus display confidence in him - is a classic trait of a con-man.

I would really like it if people, such as the author of this blog, would simply ask the bitcoin community: How can bitcoin hold its value given this type of scenario? Then we could say, yes, we have thought about that and here is why we think it can hold its value (or whatever fault they think they have found).
Instead they write a whole article with dubious and grandiose titles such as the one submitted: "How and why BitCoin will plummet in price". It doesn't make the author look smart, it makes them look arrogant.
Not saying that we don't welcome people thinking about bitcoin and its possible flaws. Of course we welcome that.

The community has already decided on milli Bitcoins (mBTC), as per the SI standard. Not really necessary to have cents.

I'd invite you to read [this document]( for a very good description of what consensus entails. That document came out of the process of building the internet.
Bitcoin began and should continue as a radical project. Radical projects do not compromise. Instead, if and when they are successful, the world finds itself accommodating to or being changed by the radical project.

That wasn't what I meant. All I meant was that there seems to be some consensus that the next division down from whole bitcoins is millibitcoins and not bitcents. But most everyone is still talking in whole bitcoins as the moment.

I'm an Australian who has voted progressive all my life. But I have great sympathy for the argument against Lincoln and the Civil War. Enforcing morality on people through violent means rarely works and most often backfires. That's exactly what happened in the Southern states. Resentment and Jim Crow laws for a hundred years after. Far better for states to embrace and implement reform themselves.
Indeed, the USA has a very long, sorry history of 'enforcing freedom' all around the world. Most of us wish you would just mind your own business.

There is no reason why you can't go down to any number of decimal places when giving an amount in yen. Just that you won't be able to physically pay that amount in cash.

So to expand more on the role that bitcoins play in the class.
Through the class you build a selfstarter site. That is a site that attracts followers or supporters and receives funding for a product or service. The site will be graded by machine for achieving certain tasks, including being able to accept bitcoin payments. The site will also be graded *qualitatively* for how many followers it gets, how many tweets / FB likes etc. *and also* on how many bitcoins it receives. The professor points out that the last metric is most like a real-world start-up (raising funding) and also the metric that is least easy to game, because bitcoin payments to an address are trackable and are measures of real transfer of value.
The lecturer stated that currently 100,000 students are signed up. A lot of these will drop out but it is still massive exposure for bitcoin.
tl;dr the course will have thousands of class participants competing to get people around the world to purchase and spend bitcoins on their web startups

munchee was unwise to start their comment with "It's different this time". However they do make good points.
Bitcoin has real utility. The underlying software/protocol is still resilient and functional. And $1 or $2 billion "market cap" is really only chicken-feed compared to the combined market cap of the NASDAQ companies at the time you are referencing.
What's happened here is that a speculative bubble, that grew too fast, has popped. But we are not in the 'go to zero' scenario yet, because bitcoin remains functional and useful.

Yes, hashing *can* be used to encrypt things. But that's not the hashing that the miners are doing. They are taking a block of transactions and adding random strings in the hope of the combined input generating a certain output from the hashing alogithm. That output is essentially, a string having a certain number of leading zeros (not absolutely technically correct, but close enough).
This desired output is arbitrary and of no use whatsoever except for winning the game that they are all playing (for the next block reward).


Not really, if everyone was told that 1 dollar is now worth 100 new dollars and thus generating new divisibility. But you don't even have to do this with bitcoins as they already have a huge amount of divisibility built in. It's conceivable that the whole GDP of a nation might only be 1000 bitcoins or whatever. That wouldn't cause problems for ordinary people, who would just be dealing with small fractions of bitcoins - microbitcoins or satoshis etc. Because it's not even in the form of physical notes, scaling down into smaller and smaller units is very easy.

It showed a flat line because, by default, bitcoinity shows trades on Mt Gox. If you had changed it to showing another exchange it would have showed trades during that period.

List the interview on your Linkedin profile and send an email to CCTV thanking them for the interview and saying you expect many more exciting developments in the world of bitcoin in the near future and you would be happy to appear again on their program when they occur.
That's if you haven't already done so :)

Mike Hearn is a security guy at Google. He wrote the first java implementation of the bitcoin client, talked extensively with Nakamoto while doing so and has presented talks on bitcoin at bitcoin conferences.

Look, I don't actually have an opinion on litecoins.
But this subreddit is about bitcoins. And the title of the TF piece was: *As BitCoins Roll In, The Pirate Bay Adds Support For LiteCoin Donations*
I didn't want the discussion to devolve into arguments about litecoin which I thought it might have with that title. And I personally thought the more interesting thing *for this subreddit* is the high donation rate that the bitcoin address is getting for the Pirate Bay. So I made that the focus of my submission.
tl;dr No, I don't feel that's kind of pathetic. (And smurfmaster, please note the proper use of apostrophes.)

It is actually possible to do both, hold *and* spend.
Hold a certain amount and buy some before making a purchase at whatever the market rate is.

Yes but Linux was built on top of the GNU project and that certainly did have a political agenda right from the start. Political as in the pragmatic idealism of taking back control over the technology society uses. Money, like software, is just another technology.

Yeah, maybe the rainbow thing has become more the thing these days, as the movement has expanded from gay pride to LGBT representation. Perhaps the 1980s in the UK (and the USA?) was the time that the pink triangle was most in vogue.
I would expect that your gay friends would still know the symbol though.

No, because it becomes increasingly expensive to spam the purchase queue as the minimum order goes up.
Email spam happens because it is almost completely free to send out millions of emails. If every email cost 1c to send there would be a lot less email spam. (Not that I'm suggesting this solution for email, just trying to illustrate the point.)

What I mean is keep them as bitcoins but make them more secure. Keeping them on an online exchange is not the level of security I would be happy with. Especially as Mt. Gox was hacked before (in 2011) and because I personally am still not terribly impressed by the level of professionalism displayed by its management.

Can you tell me how many people you know in China have heard about bitcoin? How many of your IT friends?
Is there talk about it on Chinese internet forums?

Your point in yr second paragraph is a particularly good one. Bitcoin is highly unusual in being amazingly well thought out and implemented right from the start. This, in a world where 'worse is better' usually steals the jump.

I think you'll find they do this in quite a few subreddits. A general discussion thread once a week or whatever.
I'm not saying that people can't still create self-posts; just suggesting that it might be good for the mods to create a daily post so that people have a choice of throwing stuff in there rather than necessarily having to create their own self-post.

To extend your theme further, at the electrical engineering level those 1s and 0s are also abstractions of levels of current etc.. 
Levels of abstraction building on levels of abstraction is the basis of computer science and its great strength, so criticising abstraction as some sort of flaw is peculiar for a journal self styled as 'wired'.

I asked if I could pay my membership fees in bitcoins in around Feb 2012. The (very nice) administrative officer was familiar with bitcoins but said they didn't have a way to pay through their site yet so that your membership got credited, but that if I did it as a donation she would personally register the membership extension.
However in the end I'm sorry to say I didn't follow through and just paid in cash. But will certainly pay my membership in bitcoins next time.
