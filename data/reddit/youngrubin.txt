You're right, but at the same time people like using apps. It's an easy one tap thing. Does Amazon need an app? NO. But having the option is nice.
It's marketing thing too. Once somebody downloads your apps that logo is in your face everyday.

This was nothing! The dip wasn't that big, we rebounded off solid support set last week at $15500. Additionally  Coinbase stated the support of BCH before the end of the year months ago. They needed to give access to BTH to their customers who were holding BTC before the fork. 
In a few days to a week this will be history and the reddit will turn back into memes. All these negative conspiracy and hates posts make us look bad. Let's keep stuff positive peeps!

A huge issue was people could get money to purchase a house that they didn't actually own. When you buy bitcoin you own it. Banks wont let you borrow to buy bitcoin so the most people can do right now is buy credit cards or cash mortgage their homes. Currently we are not in an environment that would promote this. Even if bitcoin crashed to 0... it would suck for most of us, but we would still be able to pay our everyday fiat bills.

Coinbase never issues BTC holder their BTH from the fork. Of course it will be high priority to make BTH available to get all those customers their forked coins. It was known for a long time that it was coming.

I'm simply advising dollar cost averaging instead of waisting mental energy  following/trying to predict predict the markets.
The only way I would advise any other strategy is if you have a well back tested model/bot and some spare cash to gamble with. Trying to predict the market as a mere human is the most retarded time waisting activity you can do.

Yeah, but it's rather difficult and time consuming compared to logging into an exchange a buying some on a CC. 
The silver lining is that I suppose it's more decentralized and a better way to train people to buy Bitcoin.

My mother (50yr) wants to buy $35,000. She has no clue what bitcoin is about. She just wants to be part of the excitement. Investment bankers from her golf club are taking advantage of the current press around bitcoin. They are having "bitcoin" lectures every other week and recommending a small part of peoples portfolio in bitcoin.
The catch? They allude to mt.gox and say exchanges are risky. BUT than they say that they are more than happy to buy and store the investments for a fee.

The question is, what will you do with the cash after you sell the bitcoin?  If you need it for immediate to short term expenses, SELL. If you are overweighted in crypto and want to diversify, SELL. But if you're just going to hold on to cash, you might as well let this play out. 
Time in the market beats timing the market.

Interesting, that all makes perfect sense but why didn't we avoid all this during the last fork? if I understand correctly the reason for the btc/bth fork on august 1st was because of different philosophies in regards to scaling. The apposing philosophies were increasing block size vs segwit. This resulted in a fork. Which brings me to my question... Why didn't core take the side if sigwit during the last fork only to oppose it now? Why wasn't this power struggle resolved during the last fork? 
Sorry if anything I wrote is incorrect, I just purchased my first btc (was unaware of the btc/bth fork at the time) and am only now starting to educate myself on the politics.
