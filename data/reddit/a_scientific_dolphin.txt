Same as it was/is with cash-based businesses/employees. Your money will have to come from somewhere and you will spend it somewhere.
If Employer says we did pay Employee amount X in Bitcoin/Monero/Whatever and Employee does not declares X on its tax return that's a red flag.
If you are driving a lambo everyday to work with no declared income to pay for it that's a red flag. The same when your lambo dealer gets audited and you purchase comes up.

People make bad investments all the time. People make good investments all the time.
Most believe their own judgement of the future to be the most reliable one.
Ask yourself this: Why 50/50? Why not 60/40, 20/90, 100/0 or 0/100. The reality is nobody knows what is going to happen but compared to "casino gambling" the game is not intentionally rigged to screw you (hopefully, it might be that all exchanges are very manipulated)

Yes...I'm now a war hardened fighter simply by going to work each day. The fear of being arrested by the all knowing secret police is a constant worry /sarcasm
Please don't make the mistake of thinking of the EU as the European USA, because it is not. Plenty of different politics, economics and mindsets among its members. Of course some legal initiatives on EU and National levels are quite worrying.
Just as with any country, EU-members have some better and some worse parts and people. It really depends on where you live, but claiming the whole continent (and attached islands ;) ) is basically "1984-World" is weird?

For me at least it's all about predictability. For example with cash I  expect an average yearly inflation rate of  1-3%. Baring any exceptionally stupid political decision (see venezuela)  in my country this is a fairly reasonable assumption given decades of history.
With stocks, but even more so with Bitcoin a 20% swing within a single day is expected. Also remember that Bitcoin is less than 10 years old and the current trend of rising prices started less than a year ago. Hard to predict and a risk averse person will put that into consideration

This. 
Without knowing the specifics of OPs situation I am wondering how "paycheck to paycheck" and "I've invested" fit together.
Either there is money left after expenses or there isn't. If OP is able to buy bitcoin he would also have been able to keep the money in a savings account.
Sadly I know to way too many people who are making good money and are still constantly broke. Any raise in income is immediately matched by a raise in expenses.

The big deal is that some people ( not necessarily OP) thought that because tax authorities did not care for Bitcoin when it was virtually unknown, they would continue not caring. 
The same happened with the internet:
Some people assumed that the government would never have the technology and knowledge to regulate actors or prosecute people for online crimes.

My intention was to adress an aspect of fintech that was not yet discussed in this thread. 
Story time:

Don't be that guy! Instead be aware of your limitations and of the unique requirements of fintech software.

I just noted that "If it would be easier to just buy and store bitcoins..." is one of the reasons banks exist (and probably will continue to do so regardless of the success of crypto). There will always be a market for storing other peoples money.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:50:24
Hindsight bias might be at play here. After the fact only one possibility remains and some people will have predicted that.
With Bitcoin, right now people are predicting the bubble will pop while others are certain there is no bubble.
In 10 years those who are right will be seen as prophetic even if their assessment were based on nothing but their own speculation.
It's really hard to do real analysis based on facts in such an environment especially if your data/model is incomplete.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:28:53
Interesting project. I would like to add a different point to the discussion (sorry if I'm preaching to the choir ;) ):
Despite your other priorites, security and realiabilty must be a major design concern! You are (by proxy) managing other peoples money. It is not okay to figure out security as you go. You have to plan in advance!
Some questions to ask:
- Who is using your system?
- How attractive a target is your sytem?
- How will your system be attacked?
- How will your users be attacked? (scams, SE, etc)
- How stupid will you most stupid user be? (Hint: More stupid than you think)
- How secure is your platform? What security features does it offer? (Plaintext private keys are a big no no)
- What happens if your plattform gets owned and all data of your app gets copied? Is the users money still safe?
Some scenarios to consider:
-  Criminals WILL take a look at your source code and try to find (technical or SE) weaknesses. 
- Android / iOS WILL get exploited and your apps data storage WILL be stolen.
- Users WILL act stupidly and fat-finger the wrong amount. You will be blamed if they send 100BTC instead of 100 mbtc without confirmation.
- Smartphones WILL break, get stolen or lost. Enforcing a suitable backup solution is not optional especially if you are targeting nontechninal users.
Banks implement (and legally have to implement) an enomours amount of security. This is done for a reason even and even with this considerable effort, sometimes hacks and thefts happen. Don't be the guy who programmed the wallet that lost Grannys life savings when her phone died.
Good luck. Have fun. Don't implement your own crypto.

I am not a tax advisor:
- tax it: one sensible approach could be to look at the fair market value and treat the sale as if you sold all of your BTC (taxable), handed over cash and the seller bought the same amount of bitcoin.
- be aware: because deals like these leave a paper trail that can be matched with transaction s in your bank/exchange account. If you ever get audited you should be able to show where that car payment came from.

If they didn't declare their gains, didn't find some rich people legal (!) loophole (unlikely) then yes they do own a lot
What makes you think they avoided taxes?

With that amount of money you can certainly afford to hire a lawyer and have them send an official letter. More effective than Reddit in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:22:17
I do not have enough insight to answer that with much confidence.
However, right now fees contribute only about 10-15% towards the toal miner reward ( So either the fees per block increase  5 to 10 times or a different solution has to be found. Otherwise hash power (and therefore security) will decrease.
With regard to the state of the code right now, remember that originally the "block size problem" was believed to have an easy solution. That turned out quite differently than expected.
Again, there are more knowledgable people than me on this sub :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:10:28
I am not a tax advisor and have no specific information about US tax rules. Hire a professional to help you!
In some tax systems you can carry forward the loss created by the stock sale into the future and use it to reduce taxable gains.
Example(way way way over simplified):
Year 0: Buy stocks for 10k
Year 4: Sell stocks for 5k (declare 5k loss on your tax report). Buy 5k Bitcoin
Year 5-10: Don't do anything. Carry the loss forward (It stays in the system)
Year 11: Sell Bitcoin for 10k. The 5k profit can (if legal) be added to the 5k loss from year 4 so your total taxable gains are 0 and your tax is 0 as well.

They (and their peers around the world) are probably following the developments in crypto currencies and are looking for areas where regulations much apply and whether new rules or laws are needed.
How this ends will depend upon a lot of factors including politics, economic developments, local financial history,  and public sentiment

For the most part of human history people were their own banks. Valuables, money and wealth were stored in homes for a long long time.
Among many other things, banks were created to centralize security and protection.
For my part, I certainly don't want to be responsible for protecting decades of savings from fire, theft (including "friends"), memory loss, natural disasters, compromised backups, or vengeful people. It makes sense to leave these scenarios to a professional institution which is liable for any loss and which can hire experts in the field.
Regardless of whether you believe that transactions should be reversible or not, insurances do exist to reduce the impact of unexpected events.

Your observation is correct, however did you notice that almost any shop (especially in Berlin) and all of the large chains offer to pay by card?
Since a few years most even support NFC and most banks by now have started to ship cards that than be used contactless.
Within a rounding error every German has a bank account and a debit card which they can use to pay for their daily needs (maybe with the exception of some restaurants).
It would be a little bit naive to attribute the love of cash to not having debit cards around.
@_date: 2018-06-19 11:41:37
Nope. That depends on  each (EU) Member States policy.

The problem is, I don't own any property since I live in a very urban area in a densly populated country. Prices are high and a majority of people rents (many for a lifetime).
So in this scenario would my landlord decide what rights I have (because he is the one paying the taxes on the property where I live)? Somehow I don't believe this would be a popular solution. ;)

Just in case your story is real and for any potential reader.
DO NOT try to evade taxes owed on the gains. Yes, depending on your location it will not be cheap, however why would anyone expose themselves to even greater fines and other punishments, especially on such a public asset as Bitcoin? Simply makes no sense since you are talking about a life changing amount of money here.
 The blockchain is the perfect auditing tool for financial authorities around the globe (everything is public). They can probably find you years later. Do not assume they are stupid and/or technologically inept. You are not playing on the same level as the big tax evaders ( most likely)

Not even that I would guess. Whoever gives you your money (via what communication infrastructure?) for whatever you are doing will have a physical location and therefore a chance to get tax audited.
Realistically, the only real way to get away from society (and therefore laws and government) is to leave.

Your last paragraph is critical. It all depends on your local tax code. 
Iam not a tax advisor: For example Germany declared Bitcoin to be "Private Money" (when held by individuals) and profit from selling them is not subject to capital gains when held for over a year.

But I pay taxes as well, so it's in the interest of the government to protect my rights in order for me to thrive, earn a good salary (and pay more taxes).

Another risk factor comes into play if/when the basic hashing algorithm of Bitcoin (SHA256) is broken through Cryptoanalysis.
This would mean that a block could be created that would have the same hash value as an existing block in the chain. Effectively this would mean that nodes could no longer decide which of them is the "original" one. It would allow to alter transaction and/or lead to inconsistencies among nodes.
However, it is very unlikely that such a practical attack on SHA256 will appear out of the blue. Probably there will be early warning signs (such as increasingly better and better theoretical research results). Hopefully there will be plenty time to adjust the algorithm to something more state of the art if needed.
