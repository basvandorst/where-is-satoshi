These are fractals. Look into it bro. Timeframe doesn't matter.

No fungibility, bitcoins become tainted, people lose confidence as a medium of exchange.
Also, if volatility continues no one will want to use it. 
Sha2 might have some NSA backdoors. Noone knows.
After each block reward halving, btc is tested more and more as we see whether miners can be subsidised only by tx fees. After fifth/sixth/etc. block reward halving we might find out that miners are not willing to mine just for tx fees and the block reward subsidy does not incentivise enough miners.
While Bitcoin has the first mover advantage, it does not mean it will remain leader.

Boris Johnson becoming prime minister is a sign of the times. Fake news gang powering up. Boris once faked quotes as a journalist
Get ready for Bitcoin FUD!

Absolute hashing power is not relevant. It's how distributed that hash power is.

well I have both bitcoin and gold. 
And you are assuming everyone has the same knowledge as you. Protecting your btc is a steep learning curve if you ask me. With gold, it's much more simple.

so then bitcoiners will be double fucked.

getting gold from asteroids as if we were catching crabs with a net is a bitcoiner maxi's wet dream and used to promote the bitcoin is the better, digital version of gold narrative. 
We'll all be dead before we know whether bitcoin really outshines gold - ~2140 or beyond. (or perhaps even before then if bitcoin is broken in some way)

lol, mining gold from asteroids, the classic heuristic. Good luck with that. 
Bitcoin is not as fungible as gold, as I can look at the blockchain. If i give you some gold, you do not know who transacted with it or when.  
If you lose your seed, lose your memory or lose your computer, you lost your bitcoin! For you to lose gold is much harder. 
Some bugs may be catastrophic and latent, so a fix might not be possible. 
"Gold isn't a useful investment anymore because smuggling gold is much more risky then bitcoin" - why does everyone bring up crossing borders. As long as I have a gun, I'm fine staying in my own country with my gold - kill me if you have to.

"now that bitcoin exists there is no need for gold"
Except that gold has a much longer track record than bitcoin. Who's to say SHA-256 won't be exploited or there won't be a computer science or cryptography fuck up in bitcoin in the next 5-10 years?
More people are HODLing gold than they are bitcoin. More people trust gold than bitcoin.
Portability and divisibility are much better in bitcoin, but most other aspects of money is done better by gold, i.e., fungibility, medium of exchange, unit of account, and is arguably more durable than bitcoin. Gold also trumps bitcoin on store of value, given bitcoin's short history and wild volatility. Just because it has appreciated a million percent doesn't make it a store of value - I could easily argue that it has the potential to go down a million percent as well - which it can. It's premature to call bitcoin a store of value - although I hope it does outdo gold in this regard.

think how expensive it would be to transport and mine that gold from asteroids. good luck. gold from asteroids is very theoretical at the moment. How many asteroids have we actually probed for gold? Is there any data on that?
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:02:29
ok, you're anally right but it's just a poetic device - an exaggeration.
@_date: 2019-08-06 01:33:03
The number of people you know owns gold bears no relation to the amount of people that actually do. Think of India, pretty everyone who has savings has it in gold, same goes for most other Far East countries. People in the West do that too, but not as prevalent. 
People can exchange gold these days, just because it's not used as such doesn't mean it's not a medium of exchange. You have small bars/coins that could be 1g up to 28g. States have traded gold on the gold standard, but since the US cut the link with the USD, they don't anymore. In any case, it's more of a medium of exchange than bitcoin - on average, more people would exchange gold for something than bitcoin and it is possible for someone that holds gold coins/bars to do so.
