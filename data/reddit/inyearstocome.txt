Anonymity, exchange limits, convenience, time, actually USING bitcoin, etc. Plenty of reasons to earn btc. Why have a fiat intermediary if you can avoid it?

Good luck enforcing. People will move to more anonymous methods of entry, use lightning network, and that's that. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:13:52
Decentralized exchanges, local bitcoins (matching you to people willing to buy/sell in your area), bitcoin ATM, earning BTC, etc.

Only the initiating party (payer/buyer) could keep named  records, unless the accepting party (payee/merchant)  requires identification from the payer. This will happen for large transactions that will clearly still need regulation for various reasons, but won't happen for smaller transactions (payer/buyer will remain anonymous).

In the relatively near term, you won't need to return to fiat, and you'll be able to earn bitcoin (and other various coins). Items will have value in crypto currencies and it will be insanely easy for merchants to accept your coin.

Unless you are Howard_1127...Why not use a wallet with a good reputation? Plenty are available on iOS and are good enough to hold reasonable amounts of BTC. As always, best practice is not to keep a large amount on a mobile wallet.

Deeper than that, we already have sub-Satoshi units that can be used via lightning and other side chains.

You can try to sue a non-entity, but good luck getting results or stopping anything. The beauty of a truly decentralized crypto like bitcoin is that you can't shut it down or coerce it's development. They (MC / VISA / many other players in the fiat financial industry) can and will release their own shitcoins, side chains, and probably even forks of bitcoin that cripple some features for the sake of control, but can't force adoption or out compete bitcoin "core".  Long term, the market will be aware of their options to choose decentralized, censorship resistance crypto that doesn't rely on greedy and untrustworthy middlemen.

Many will use corporate coins. There will be reasonably valid uses for them, and those that don't care about cencorship, privacy, government over reach, etc will happily use them. But these people aren't the ones running nodes. It's clear that there will always be many crypto currencies, but the truly valuable ones will be increasingly popular when global, open, decentralized applications and marketplaces utilize them.

The banks.
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:16:12
That’s not a withdrawal, it’s an exchange and then withdrawal using the convenience of their mobile app (thats a sucker fee.)
If you sell using the trading interface (pro) and set your sell price, there is only a very small % fee. Withdrawal of USD is then free.
Or you can simply withdraw your BTC / transfer to a private wallet.

You're not wrong, but there are many considerations to keep in mind as both possible and likely eventualilities. Banks as we know them are a cartel that are permitted to influence state fiat currencies via various financial instruments. Financial institutions position themselves around core banks to enable thier products. Let's look quickly at pension funds and stock brokerage as an example. As fiat currencies struggle to maintain fungibility against global crypto currencies, funds and interest earning instruments based in fiat become less and less attractive. Financial institutions will position themselves more and more as custodians of crypto assets and less as custodians of fiat currencies (bank adjacent). Loans are already being positioned in the regional markets via social avenues, and will continue to grow rapidly down those avenues and global markets as crypto currencies further enable them. In the same vein, a crypto loan will be more valuable than a fiat loan. As decentralized applications improve and scale, financial institutions will have huge parts of their product offerings replaced by public applications without a central authority. I won't argue that banks and institutions will disappear anytime soon, only that they simply can't innovative as fast as the permissionless global market will, and that will shrink them into echoes of what we know them as today.

It's much much more than money. Currency is simply application  of the new decentralized trust protocol. The above graphic is identifying internet money, which already exists as fiat or redeemable organizational points. Bitcoin is an entirely new thing that creates a new decentralized internet of money and trustless transactions on a global scale. Shits about to get weird in some really interesting ways.

It (crypto currencies, largely Bitcoin) certainly will replace *most* banks. I think we can all agree it will be a long time before governments let go over having an official currency installed by the state and controlled by centralized entities that benefit at the expense of the users, but competition with a decentralized and free market will be increasingly difficult. The barrier to entry now is earning or exchanging into BTC. As more and more employers offer compensation in crypto, (and for various other reasons) adoption will start growing rapidly. Wallets and custodians that offer enhanced services will replace most banks, and decentralized applications will start replacing custodians with enhanced features built in, with no middleman.

Lots of misunderstanding in this thread. This should help clear things up a little.
A centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini has regulatory compliance requirements (KYC, AML) and rules imposed to cover their own asses. When you do a CC transaction or Bank Transfer (ACH debit), it takes time to clear those transactions. Typically 3-5 days depending on the method used.
Both CC and ACH transactions have reversibility built into them, and the exchange isn't going to cover that risk. You technically don't have any funds to use at the exchange until that transfer clears. What they do to help encourage new customers is pre-credit your fiat wallet (eg, USD) and allow you to exchange immediately, but hold any sort of withdrawal until the funding transaction clears. They're not "not allowing you to xfer your bitcoin", because it's not yours until the funding transaction clears.
If you instead Wire transfer to the exchange, you pay a fee up front (usually $10-15 depending on your bank) and the funds will clear very quickly to the exchange. Then you can exchange and withdraw/xfer to a private wallet immediately.

Yes, but you must have gotten your fiat into a coin or token somehow to begin with, unless you earned it?
@_date: 2019-01-13 05:12:09
Safe... Sure. You'll get your crypto as long as it's legal. Your purchase and any sales will be reported, but that is still tough to avoid currently. Whatever you do, just make sure that you transfer your coins to a private wallet where you control the keys. If you keep them in a custodial wallet on the exchange, you don't own them. Not your keys, not your coin.

Not very accurate, except for the lack of awareness part.
No computer needed at all. A simple feature phone is all that is needed to own and operate a private bitcoin wallet, and you can transact over SMS even without a reliable data connection. As awareness spreads, people will flock to crypto markets and find ways around surveillance banking and superinflating government fiats.

You can make oxygen illegal, but you can't stop people from breathing.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:11:26
Fixed. "Singapore realizes it can't block crypto currencies like Bitcoin, so making it illegal would be a useless stunt that would only accelerate adoption."

 Of course there are those who perceive bitcoin as a "USD investment", the same way as they do commodities. However, it's extremely unlikely that other commodities would be used in commerce, especially on a global scale. Bitcoin is already useful for commerce on a global scale, and it's hardly past the alpha development stage in it's ease of use. It's the new wave of money that is separate from government or corporate control. While both will do everything in their power to influence it, they'll continue to fail in the medium and long term. I don't invest in bitcoin to return to USD... I transfer the value of my USD into a system that has proven to be more resilient, deflationary, and beyond control from greedy beurocrats.

It looks like it waits until your "roundups" hit a $5 threshold and then exchange. The fees are $2/mo, then 1% off all transactions + $0.15 per deposit and $0.25 per withdraw.

That comment chain devolved quickly. GSTV is a national program specifically to play on gas station screens, which are very common in high traffic gas stations. I think the point was that it doesn't matter where you're seeing it, since it's the same nation wide in the US. Useful tip--If you press the 2nd from the top button to the right of the screen, you can usually mute the sound and go about your pumping experience without being advertised to.

No need to buy. He could straight up mine thousands of BTC in the first few years and hodl with a smirk on his face.
