A perfect reason to not keep your eggs in one basket.  Diversify, spread wealth out over multiple forms and don't risk all of your wealth on one thing unless you can afford to lose everything. Remember, if TSHTF: booze, bullets, food, water, medicine, fuel. You can survive pretty much anything with those.

Yeah, because a company generating $100B/yr is at all worried about Bitcoin. One that is so tightly wound into the fabric of the Fed and given a free pass by the government to do whatever the hell they want with no repercussions is worried. Sure, makes sense.

Seems like a fantastic idea. Get bitcoins from an address associated with Silk Road, send to politician of your choice, claim in media politician is talking drug money and show the chain back to Silk Road. Success! Now, most of the people here are smart enough to know what is going on if they see that, but the rest of the population is utterly clueless. 
Great, now I'm probably on a list.

Be adaptable in life. Change will come at you from every facet of your life and becoming comfortable with change will help you get through rough times and help you excel in good times. Fighting change is like fighting an advancing storm on the sea, you have to hit it head on if you want to get through it.

I was joking (mostly). I'm not sure anyone really knows what the latest is unless someone has privileged knowledge and knows they are reopening again. Or it could be a pump and dump. That's the thing with investments that are unregulated, nobody knows and nobody is accountable.

This is exactly what the government wants. They want to regulate bitcoin out of existence. Sucks. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:51:32
The politicians are deeply in the pockets of the Big Banks and Wall St and I guarantee they aren't going to look positively on Bitcoin. It's a threat to their profits and the way they do business and since they don't have regulatory control over Bitcoin or can control large amounts of it they will fight it tooth and nail. I wouldn't be surprised to see them immediately trot out pending regulations and use money laundering and scare tactics relating to terrorism to get mainstream America on board. Just my tinfoil hat theory but sadly I think that's closer to reality than not. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:27:12
Your wife must be incredibly tech savvy to be able to figure out how to gamble using bitcoin. The fact that she's that savvy also means she had to know what those were worth and what she was doing. No way you can figure out hey I can gamble with bitcoin and NOT know what they are worth. Doesn't add up.

All good points but the big issue I see is even if it's underground like Prohibition how do you get your money? All the banks will collude so that you can't redeem Bitcoins with any bank, esp ones based in the US. Worse, most of them have a global reach making it more difficult. Any transactions are going to be akin to money laundering and subject to money laundering laws. Just playing devils advocate here. Having an ex that wrote policy for the big C bank in just this area, trust me, they know how to fuck you given the chance.

I would think that this would work once the market settles in and there isn't such volatility. There's not much of a threat of large bank runs in usd these days but with such wild swings bitcoin experiences now I don't think it'd be a smart position.

@_date: 2013-11-21 02:29:24
An interesting question actually. There's conceivably a lot of coins that will be delivered on Friday from sales around the spike. Now, what people were able to buy them at and what they plan to do with them is quite a variable. Some will want to cut losses from buying high (assuming the price stays at or below its current level), some will hold in hopes of making a profit and some will spend. So, no idea what the price will do but I'm thinking there will be some volatility in the market when they do get released. If nothing else, it'll be interesting to see what happens.

Are you licensed as a money transmitter? If you aren't you are opening up yourself to having the hammer dropped on you by the Feds. The laws are still vague but if you send/receive cash over $1000 commercially then you need to be registered. You're out cash, coins and opening up yourself to legal actions. 
You really didn't think this through did you? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:43:53
Generally I agree however India is also undergoing some serious currency issues at the moment. With the Indian government cracking down on precious metal imports people will be looking for ways to diversify their wealth. There's pretty solid inflation in the INR at the moment and that destroys purchasing power. But, Indians are generally looking for real stores of value (ie their lust of gold) and are pretty savvy bankers so I could see Bitcoin being used...cautiously. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:46:14
It's China. I think that's all the explanation needed. They are a Communist regime and really don't HAVE to explain themselves.

If I'm a business, why would I accept less than what I could get in fiat dollars? Where's the incentive? Sure I don't have to pay fees to MC or Visa but it's what, 2%? I still have to convert it into fiat and that takes time and dollars and fees. Now they could offer 2%10/net 30 so there are terms like that available for some customers but you damn well better be doing a TON of business for me to offer that. Immediate payment is nice but honestly if I'm in business, I'm ok with net on a 30 day billing cycle. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:42:06

True story: At one point in my life I had $7 to my name and a week until my next paycheck (moved to a new city, huge college loans, maxed CC, any available cash went into security deposits etc etc). So I did the reasonable thing and bought a $5 scratch off lottery ticket. Won $500. Got hit with enough unforeseen bills that week to spend away the entire $500. 
But don't be me, worked out for me but there's 100:1 ratio of stories that didn't end like mine.

What I came here to say. Most of the people here are savvy enough to get how Bitcoin works and do the steps necessary at this point to buy and sell it. The vast majority of people outside of here have no clue and aren't willing to do the work required to obtain them. Let's be honest, there's a lot of really fucking dumb people out there and if Chase came to them and said this is good and you need this, they'll use it. 
The other part of this is that Chase would control ALL the virtual currency. That means they (and a select group of institutional investors they get to choose) get to control all the arbitrage opportunities and profits from the new virtual currency. They could release more at any time for any reason, just like the Fed does with the USD. Basically, they are becoming Fed 2.0 and the goverment will give them that sweetheart deal just because they are in their pocket. 
So yeah, this sucks for us and Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:42:16
If you are risk averse this really isn't the place to put your money right now. None of us have any clue what Friday will bring let alone the next 5 minutes. If you think of this as an investment buy and hold. If it's speculative trading, better be ready to lose your money. If you want to support Bitcoin then buy some and spend it. Have a strategy and stick to it. There are no guarantees.
