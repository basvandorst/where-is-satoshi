I wasn't too worried about losing reputation from uber.  I dont drive for them much....I prefer lyft because they are pro tipping!  After 30 trips with Lyft and Uber, I still havent received a btc tip from a rider.  Reddit readers have sent me .07!  I am super grateful and will continue the bitcoin conversation with all my riders.

You are correct.  Uber undercharges the riders.  That is exactly why taxi companies are so unhappy...Uber is stealing all the business by undercutting the competition.  Drivers for Uber simply receive whatever the program gives them, which is consistently lower than the value received by the rider.  Tips help, and are 100% voluntary.

No, uber doesn't pay well.  Their whole angle is too steal taxi service in municipalities by providing cheap fares to customers.  They take $1 from every ride, then 20% from all fares.  The surge pricing is a joke...when they have a low volume of cars in an area, they increase the fare multiplier, then once it has attracted drivers to the area with the promise of increased fares, they drop the fare pricing to normal.  You can get a 30 minute ride to the airport for around $35 in PDX.  Uber driver gets &lt;$27, but pays all the gas &amp; maintenance.  Lyft encourages riders to tip their drivers...Uber will fade as their drivers realize they are being used. Tips = To Insure Proper Service

I'm the Uber driver here.  That was a mistake...a clumsy one at that.  That 2 BTC was not a tip, but a transfer to the new wallet made back in May 22nd.  The windfall of uber/bitcoin tips from July 22nd via reddit/imgur totals 47mBtc currently.  I'm grateful for the all the support!  ...Almost have enough for a nice lunch.
I never shame a customer into tipping...the QR is merely a conversation starter.  I'm within the Uber ToS; I am cashless and do not accept cash tips from riders.  Uber can decide not to accept bitcoin, but their handbook doesn't state that I cannot post cryptocurrency QR codes inside my car.  Lyft encourages the idea anyway.

The dollar has never had a second derivative that was negative...meaning inflation rate is always increasing.  The true novelty of bitcoin is that the second derivative is negative, meaning that inflation is present, but the rate of inflation is falling, ie the reward system halves every few years until it reaches a total of 21 million in existence.  Could you imagine apple stock that never splits!?!?!

I heard about bitcoin in spring of 2011 when Wikileaks announced they accept bitcoin for donations.  I promptly setup mining equipment and mined 1-2 btc/day.  I mined over 300btc in a short period and sold most of them between $30-60 each.  I still own 4btc and all the mining equipment.  FML

The truly funny part of that statement is that video cards that operated at 99% and stayed below 80C operated at the best efficiency.  Your Watts-to-Mhash ratio is lower at higher temps.  Sorry  about your facepalm.
