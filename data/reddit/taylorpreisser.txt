As pointed out in the comments on youtube the new tax law applies to 2018 tax year so there is likely a chance that you could still claim a like kind exchange for an event that took place in 2017.  This becomes a bit more difficult due to how like kind exchanges need to be structured and the parties that are involved.  Going from one coin to another will be out and going from bitcoin to fiat to bitcoin will likely be out unless the exchange is structured to participate in like kind exchange.

From the IRS website which talks about using an exchange facilitator.  It is reasonable to think that if an exchange was structured as a facilitator then they would be able to carry out 1031 exchanges, however; that will likely increase the complexity and regulatory requirements of their business which would make it infeasible.
Since the IRS does treat crypto as property it is reasonable to assume that a 1031 exchange could be applied to it given the right circumstance.

I have been waiting to post a screen shot of this because I remember adding OKcoin bookmark and having the Bitstamp price right by it.  I have some coins bought at the $900 range and some bought at the $250 range but the best part is I still have the roughly the same amount as when I first started buying.  It was hard to hold on when it dipped from $900 down to the $250ish mark but not having a need for the money helps.  This is a simple reminder to those entering into the Bitcoin world to be ready for an up and down ride.  If you have the ability to hold your coins you are more likely to have them increase in value.  If you are going to jump into the game now just remember it has been a wild ride to this point and best guess is it will be a wild ride for the next few years.
Side note: I enjoy sports betting and Bitcoin has given me the ability to do that with ease, which is why nitrogen sports is also a bookmark.
