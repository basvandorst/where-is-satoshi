They both need to understand that BTCC (Bitcoin Core) is not BTC , it makes me sad.
edit: regardless roger is retarded as usual and vays can't fire back properly.. it was more like a comedy to me

I always throw up a little when someone says Bitcoin core (BTCC) and not BTC..

Yes goblins in the mines get the bitcoins and distribute it in exchange for electricity.

It will ONLY go to zero if nobody uses it and exchanges remove it.. (then alts would die with it)

Can you hear what you just said? If you send any BTC to any centralised exchange where you probably had to do some sort of KYC they got your identification then even if you send your btc to another address it will not matter because you can clearly see the transaction (since you can see ALL of the transactions on the blockchain)
The only way you can be anon on a centralised exchange is a good VPN provider , throwaway email and monero or BTC + mixer. (even from withdrawing using mixer sometimes you can still be tracked)
I'll give you a better [link]( , he probably explains this a lot better than me.

Trust me only about 0,01% of the people knows how the internet works but everyone uses it right? 
I'd say bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency / asset even thought we are not able to use it as a currency as of yet, maybe we never will be.
In the worst case scenario BTC will be the digital gold as many have said before.
If you use crypto in the right way no one will ever know which address is yours and what amounts you have in there..
If you don't trust free wallets then I'd recommend you buying a Ledger or Trezor. (basically trusting a 3rd party's product)


The internet itself is safe and trustless.
To stay safe with your devices I'd just say the usual.. (dont be stupid going reckless on downloading shit and watching dodgy pornsites. jk get a hooker)
You always trust someone with your internet connection and some of the providers are monitoring the usage and flow however technically they do not know what do you do they can only guess. I will not go in depth.
 Phone  - there is always trust unless its a throwaway android phone (50-100 dollz) with a sim that you can top up the internet with or cafe wifi (depends).
Computer - You have to trust the operation system.
To keep it short and sweet at the end of the day you have to trust something.. When you born you get a name, number, identification.. You already have to trust some sort of system right? 
Just don't get scared of someone not holding your hand if you fuck-up a transaction.
In 9 years BTC never have been attacked / hacked or broken into, try to apply this to any of the banks.
Hope this clarified some of your concerns and I made some sense...

True if your other wallet was never in "contact" with any centralised exchange and you just send it via mixer.
Otherwise it'd be obvious that you just sending transactions back and forth to yourself.
Correct me if I'm wrong please, thanks for your comments.
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:39:19
I meant on the common ones they still track your IPs. (yahoo, gmail, hotmail etc)

You think the person will sell it asap after commiting a crime stealing internet money?? r u dumb?
@_date: 2018-12-16 09:43:07
Been using it for 3+ years. Its all good and they do have lightning or segwit. 
Last time the transaction took 2 seconds.
