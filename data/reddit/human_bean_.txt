Bitcoin is the perfect Ponzi scheme, in that it isn't Ponzi scheme at all because the money can't be hidden on a public ledger, removed or falsely claimed to return any profits.
Bitcoin is very much like fiat. It has value because people think it has value. Differences to government based fiat: you can't directly pay your taxes with it, it can't be seized, it is not backed by violence, it can't be used by the government as a hidden tax system through printing.

I did dump my BCH, for 0.11 BTC/BCH. Seems it was still the profitable decision to make.

Proof of Stake is hyper-ponzi (the rich get exponentially richer), and the buy in is millions of dollars. Of course it's an investment, just not for the regular people. Only for the rich and well connected.
Plus as far as I gathered from Jimmys and Lopps summary, it's not an actual blockchain as there are no chain or blocks.

I thought Bitcoin at 5 dollars was too high and still haven't bought any.

I want lightning networks. I don't want the blocksize to explode, as running a full node is already difficult enough. Whatever achieves that in the most secure and painless manner, is what I will support. At this moment that solution seems to be Segwit.

I'm not sure it's even worth the risk of moving around large amounts of BTC. At most I'm going to get like what? 5 bucks?

The evolution argument is an example of the type of thinking that is logically fallacious. It's not a direct comparison. Simply a tool for people to understand the logical fallacy better.

Civil forfeiture is currently one of the big issues in the US. It's corrupted to the core. The person doesn't have to be convicted of a crime, only suspected. Which basically means the government can seize all of your assets any time it wants, without any reason. They only need to "suspect" you of criminal activity.

1 million BTC being dumped all at once would certainly be a sight to behold.

Moore's law hasn't been in effect for years for CPU's. Much less for internet bandwidth.

By big gangs with big guns, also called "the government".

99% of scientist think evolution is true therefore it's a controversial issue and both sides should be tought equally on schools. Yeah, no. It's quite obvious which side of the debate has the technological upper hand here. Claiming that simply because people disagree, both sides of the argument have equal validity, is a logical fallacy.

The harder it becomes to run a node, the more centralized Bitcoin becomes. If I wanted centralized currency easily influenced by politics and governments, I'd just use banks or Paypal.
I believe there is a direct correlation between the blockchain size, bandwidth requirements and node availability.

Indeed. 
Even if Bitcoin dies, something else will grow out of the ashes in the crypto space, stronger than before. As long as internet and computers are available, I'm not seeing cryptocoins going away.

Yes, lets all record our lives on the internet and let the third parties sell all of our data for the highest bidder. I'm sure that will end well.

The whole blocksize debacle is a great case study for real world politics. Gained a lot of insight how people actually operate. It's really, really difficult to separate actual lies and willful malice from misunderstandings, pride and ignorance.

Both sides have demonstrated the level of their technological aptitude multiple times over.

Once I understood that the Bitcoin the blockchain and the Bitcoin the software are two separate things I can suddenly trust the technology a lot more. Once the transaction is in the ledger, it will stay there. No matter what the future brings, the past will remain unaltered.
