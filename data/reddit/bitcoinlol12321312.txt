Think of it this way. The poster has £2.6k and their goal is £10k. With no job, their income is the 5% interest/y from the savings account. With the yearly compounded interest, it would take them 27 years to obtain £10k. This is clearly far too long. Their only chance of obtaining £10k in a reasonable amount of time is to gamble it on BTC (I am just using £10k as an example and not necessarily think £2.6k -&gt; £10k is possible).

I want the one where they scale the graphs to look similar and have a massive up arrow prediction for 2019. I only saw it on forums. I cannot find it with Google images.

I cannot find the comparison graphs any where. Maybe people stopped posting them because it is March already and nothing has happened.

At this point I must ask. Do you realize I do not care about the price and just want to mess with the people who believed the 2016 vs 2017 vs 2018 vs 2019 thing?

Hey. I heard some people referencing past trends and saying Bitcoin explodes in value at the start of every year despite the warnings of past trends not being indicative of future performance and how Bitcoin would be different this year. It is March already and BTC seems to be going no where. Does anyone know when BTC is "going to moon"? If someone could post that 2015 vs 2016 vs 2017 vs 2018 vs 2019 prediction graph and tell me every year would be the same, that would be nice.

I gave that advice because BTC is high risk high reward. If the poster were to invest in BTC, odds are they would probably lose that money but if they had no income, their only way of achieving their savings goal is to gamble on the off chance BTC does well. What is better a 0% chance or a 10% chance to achieve their goal? I probably should have mentioned it also depends on how much the poster needs. If it is only something small, like a $100, keep it in a savings account. I also think you are missing context. The advice I am giving is for someone with a job and a saving goal because just accumulating through income is far more likely to succeed. Your advice is more suited for someone with no saving goal in mind.

It depends. If you have a stable income, a saving's account is probably better. If you have no income, your best bet is to gamble it on BTC, assuming you would still be fine if you lost most of it. By saving, I assume you want to accumulate money. If you just want the money to be there when you need it, a saving's account is better.

That feels like a limitation though. If Bitcoin were to become a global currency, most people must be able to access it. Also, if the value fluctuates insanely, it will force retailers to reprice daily because if BTC was a global currency, things would be priced in BTC. BTC's volatility is why some major companies have stopped using it as a payment option, e.g. Steam and Microsoft. I do not see them re-adding it until it becomes stable. It only becomes stable once BTC is priced high enough that whales cannot no longer massively influence the price but the price only raises and stays up there if major adoption occurs, so there is a clear paradox there.


Is there any significant reason for them to buy Bitcoin over other currencies, like USD, or metals, like gold, specifically for this purpose?


There is a conversion. Currently, it is fiat to BTC for the consumer then back to fiat for the retailer. Even once everyone swaps to BTC, different "conversation rates" will still exist. Say a country with a weak currency converts all their fiat to BTC, obviously they will be unable to buy as much as say USA. This means the people in that country have less BTC. When there is less currency, things are priced less. When there is more currency, things are priced more. The concept is very similar to inflation. While everything will be priced in BTC, countries with more BTC will likely charge more for the same product, so a "conversation rate" between currencies would still exist.
Also, how is paying with fiat hard? Literally just type in your name, credit card number, and CVV and the payment is finished in a second (unlike BTC). Most retailers allow saving of name and credit card number too.
Another problem is how largely in-bedded fiat is in society: everything is priced in fiat, workers are payed in fiat, and most people have all their savings in fiat. Switching from fiat to BTC on a country-scale is a massive change, and for this to ever happen BTC must be significantly better than fiat for the average person. Also, correct me if I am wrong but are all BTC payments currently manual? If BTC were ever to become absurdly priced like 10000000 USD/BTC, would you not have to type out something tedious every time you transferred money, like 0.00000000252, manually?

I have noticed that all of the posts are about drops in price. I said "[y]ou would never see any mainstream stock or currency jump 17% in a day. Show me a mainstream stock or currency that **jumped** that much in a day and preferably for no reason.
@_date: 2019-04-03 06:52:47
That is not a mainstream stock I think. I cannot find a full market cap list for the German stock exchange. The best I could find was top 100  . I consider it mainstream if its market cap is in the top 150. Top 150-200 is a maybe. Incidentally, I chose top 200 because from that point onward those markets tend to have massive swings and days with little to no volume.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:16:31
I do not see your point. What is it and how is relevant?
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:15:14
17% in a day just shows how much control the whales have over BTC. 
Edit: I just want to point out that I have no opinion about whether this will be a bull run or not. Just because the 17% was caused by whales does not mean a bull run will not happen.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:29:15
Your post made it seem as if you had dropped out but it seems not. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:25:35
I wonder if this is the typical bitcoin hodler: school dropouts that have bet everything on BTC.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:34:53
That was apparently caused by their announcement to cut the work force by 7%. The difference with BTC was there was no reason for a 17% jump, so it can only be concluded that it was purely the work of whales.


That just further contributes to my point. The less mainstream something is the more control whales have over it. A smaller market is easier to control.
@_date: 2019-04-03 07:00:45
Tell me a reason then.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:13:59
Not to this extent though. You would never see any mainstream stock or currency jump 17% in a day. I already knew whales had a hand in most markets. I made the comment because 17% in a day was just absurd.
