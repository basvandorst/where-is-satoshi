1) seller could do it personally through LocalBitcoins  
2) seller accepts Bitcoin so most likely he knows what it is and would rather own that rather than fiat  
3) seller does not need to do that in front of the costumer as the bitcoin he now owns already is a payment and therefore the exchange was successful. Later he can procede with KYC and still sell it for whatever value it then holds. Just like the costumer can later re-sell his car for whatever value it then holds.

lol you know things could go south really fast right? There are \~2Trillion dollars in circulation bills and coins. And 16 Trillion dollars in debt. That is 8x of what there is actually circulating. If one country alone decides that it values more BTC than dollar, you done fucked. They're not in control of the money supply because at this point many countries own more in debt than it would be healthy to print. I don't care though. I might be wrong and that changes nothing about anything. I might be right and exactly the same is valid.

it looks neat and it's a fine piece of art. But to my mind, this is exactly what bitcoin is against: superfluous use of energy / resources. This kind of piece can only be made in an economy like ours where spending aimlessly is a possibility since acting today is preventing tomorrow's inflation. You however, by knowing this, should be putting your digital gold to good use instead of making collages, you should be growing crops and buying land. Becoming sustainable. Do this kind of thing with material that hasn't been processed by other than your hands. And even so you will be to blame by wasting that time. Bitcoin does a good job at ending consumerism and mass production. We've gotten the point so move on. Do something productive with your life. Use that aluminium for a bucket if you must
@_date: 2019-11-25 13:29:04
great.. these questions are huge buy signals.. it means people are selling gold without knowing anything other than it being a metal.
Thought experiment: Imagine gold all of a sudden didn't take up any space, became more predictable in terms of scarcity, became easier to test for purity, easier to send, more divisible, easier to transport and easier to secure for owners. Now imagine that's not imagination. Imagine that's already around but simply has another name. Yeah.. now you know why it cannot be deemed worthless. It's literally the first time humanity has found a way to secure a public ledger in a way that gets seen by everyone without being edited by anyone... Your ancestors did try and make paintings on the walls. Some have lasted until today and that's more than a proof that being able to leave a trace of what has happened is of some value if not **the value** altogether.
Edit: and no, there's no money in history to compare it to. There have been several versions of e-cash, but never any has been decentralized. As a result, never has the history of transactions been so trustworthy as Bitcoin's. As a thinker I'd argue salt was the closest to Bitcoin humanity has ever seen in terms of money. Decentralized/Very Divisible/Fungible(works anywhere in the world the same way)/Relatively easy to store without spoiling/and most importantly: was itself it's own proof of work. You needed work done to yeld a certain weight in salt. No matter who you were or where you were. Also, since we humans live mostly on land, the only places where you could produce it were actually scarce since it would be a margin. Close to a river, ocean or sea. Then tech advanced and we became several x more efficient at producing salt and it could no longer be accepted as store of value. Bitcoin doesn't seem to suffer from technology advancement because if faster processors come about, the difficulty in mining will simply retrace. Even if your fear is quantum computing to mine previously done transactions, what will most likely be done is a fork that's now protected by quantum enabled mining machines.
You have other shitcoins that claim scalability on chain and infinite scalability but Bitcoin is and will remain the first of its kind by social consensus. Like it happened with gold being intuitively more expensive than silver when silver is actually more scarce and useful despite oxidation frailty. Then.. even if scalability and speed or ease of use do not get solved, Bitcoin is still useful for store of value. It just is. A secure system is never convenient and that's something people still don't understand. Nor do they have to.

If i was the state, I'd place your bitcoins' address on a watchlist. Hope that they don't commit suicide and as soon as they moved, I'd check your accounts/ place of spending. You're anonymous - under pseudonym. Not completely anonymous. Nor do I think should you ever be completely anonymous because that brings integrity problems. Just as Nick Szabo pointed out in his most recent podcast.

Selling Bitcoin promises is not sustainable. While Bitcoin is a fixed supply (by social consent), fiat isn't. So it will work... Until it doesn't. If Bitcoin breaks to the upside longer than you expect, you'll never have enough liquidity to fulfil all your promises. At that point you might as well just call yourself a Bank

upvoted because I wanna believe again by means of someone proving you wrong. On-chain arguments only accepted. However not all hope is lost since the  store of value still is very much the case for an asset like bitcoin. It's gold without needing to scrap ever part of the bar to prove if real

I'm a millennial. I want shit for free. Wolfram-alpha offers said shit for free. I'm not about to use your untested software and still pay for it when there's cheaper more efficient and resilient options out there.
You could however make me do some proof of work for you while I'm using your website.. the specifics of idk.. But I hear monero is pretty good on that. That said I still would avoid while wolfram alpha is around. Being brutally honest here. I don't wanna give you gold to show me math steps. That shit is and should remain free. Knowledge is and should remain free. What you do with that knowledge is what should be charged. Think about this and come up with a different spin then I'll reconsider. Until then sorry but I won't use it. Sorry I'm being just as brutal as the market will be but I'm saving you more time than the market does.
Don't develop for the sake of developing. That's called boondoggle. Even if you had adoption, the people who used it would feel defrauded and cheated as soon as they realised there were cheaper and way better options.
Edit: I've read your replies.  Yes, I'm aware wolfram alpha takes KYC for said steps. I suggest you look at the niche that's your target. Yep.. those are students. Not one gives a fuck about their identities when they feel worthless and not just worthless but indebted. So actually they have negative value. Ain't nothing a little KYC here and there could do to make said life even worse than having been scammed by a shitty university that by the way not only does KYC as also shares your grades/amount of time spent on each subject - that should be private information. If I sound rough it's because the market is, I'm just expressing the market through words. Regardless if you believe or agree, sooner or later, these words will have visible consequences.

Doesn't happen if you're a country like the US where the possibility of printing indiscriminately is on the table. Simply print -&gt; buy -&gt; sell lower than buying price. Rinse and repeat over and over until price is low enough so that to move a high amount of $$ you need to put a lot bigger amount of bitcoin on the table. PS: JP Morgan did this with gold. And it worked. For a long time anyway
@_date: 2019-10-23 11:12:30
The higher the price goes, the more fungible Bitcoin becomes, because the more scarce it will be. Imagine yourself in a desert. An ISIS member offers you water. Will you say no just because of what he did/supports? Same logic here. Only you lose by rejecting money or business and not considering that coin perfectly good. At some point someone who accepts it will take it. You lose a client and eventually marketshare. Same is not true for other not so volatile assets, but with Bitcoin this is the simple truth. At some point all bitcoins will have been on criminal hands. Just like every euro and every dollar has. At some point disputing their value because of their history is futile because 1 Bitcoin will forever be 1 Bitcoin and it will be possible to be sent across the network regardless of governments or businesses. You're the only person that you can lock outside bitcoin.  
Edit: Just like gold. How many people have not died in the past because every ounce of gold in Bank of England? You don't see banks rejecting gold for those crimes, do you? Think of the Jewish gold in SwissBank that was was left unclaimed. It's exactly the same thought process. Right now Bitcoin is at 8K but one day when one is worth 1M, maybe people will start to change those policies. We cannot change the way they think. We can only create a way to think.
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:34:46
wake up. Bitcoin is already inefficient af. And if the market cap goes up, then much more inefficient it will become. Higher price =&gt; more miners =&gt; more nodes to broadcast to. In the beginning you could transact even for free. The more adoption it faced, the more inefficient it became. Both in dollars and in satoshies.  I love the idea, but the exact reason I'm discussing it is so that my hope does not die.
I don't need to post anything online. It works under pseudonym. It's already there. The maximum anyone can do is accuse me of having that pseudonym. But ultimately, the only way that it is mine undeniably is if I sign something with the corresponding private key. Until then it's all rumours. And doing that is my decision.
When you have private transactions, you lose the trail of where money traveled to since it was mined. That's a bad thing. You lose fairness and transparency.

@_date: 2019-10-22 19:15:31
maybe there's a thing wrong with those. Why should we bring that bad part of economics into crypto? I personally don't feel comfortable with financial dealings that are private. It seems like someone is moving around parts of the fiat distribution that can potentially swing the market without full disclosure. The great thing about bitcoin being public is that no longer does a bank or institution claims to be liquid without being instantly discredited or asked to prove. More -  there is finally proof that you own whatever you own - and it is public. Available to the eyes of the poor and the rich alike.
If ever we have private transactions going on, the beginning won't have been private at all, so that seems highly unfair for the early adopters. I'm not one, but I like equality.

Oh yes I did study it. I know about validating transactions without revealing either participants or amounts.  here I explain my views on the privacy market. One that we shouldn't be trying to solve by adding n-th layer tools to the protocol before we have perfected it to a point where transactions happen without prohibitive fees while keeping security, integrity and availability of the overall network. 
Privacy is always reversible. Sometimes with more sometimes with less effort. Why do you bother having your money private if you've been taped since you left home until you arrived? Make Bitcoin fast and cheap to use and then we can build atop so you can finally have your privacy (only in transactions) lol which is pointless because you're basically creating a tunnel where an attacker cannot see inside but everything at both ends is (in most cases) completely unprotected and open to the naked eye. Shocker: Everyone cares about privacy but nobody takes measures to keep theirs in their networks and devices. And understandably. It doesn't impact your near future in any way. And that happens to be mostly where we live.

why do we want privacy on Bitcoin in the first place? I think one of the biggest virtues of bitcoin is exactly the fact that it's public. It's a public ledger just like real estate with the writing of history in stone from the first to the last transaction. If we add privacy, then we essentially change that whole idea and this valuable history record that we've been accumulating in the blockchain no longer bares any value

You can use shitcoins to buy weed man... Bitcoin to store your savings. Then, if people can google my spendings at any point in time, all that I ever did until now is already on record, so really I'm not the one who you should be making that question to. Look at it like realestate or houses... You buy it and everyone know that the piece of land is yours, and it also works the other way around - it's yours because everyone knows you own it and you always owned it since you payed for it. Same thinking goes on bitcoin. 
Then Bitcoin works under pseudonym - there won't ever be a point you can "just google it" because all that you have will be names provided by some centralised source. That is easily attacked and that is easily impersonated and therefore not worthy of the same level of trust that you put on an entire blockchain. IE - "I do believe this address has this Bitcoin because it's verifiable" vs "I suspect this person has this much Bitcoin because the source is somewhat trustable."
@_date: 2019-10-08 20:04:53
Well I only hope that when the day comes that I've been here for as long as you have, I'm not only spending my Bitcoin on what's just but I'm also still willing to learn. That said. This isn't judgemental. It's just that I disagree. I wish your nails achieve good outcomes still.
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:45:37
Thought experience. Most bitcoin is used for "hodl" Imagine the market cap goes to 2 Trilion over night. People "hodling" will all try to sell and simply clog the network. Imagine you want to use your money because you ran into an emergency. How will you ever sell it or use it under these conditions? If you have it but you can't use it, then that's as good as not having. Which leads us back into square one. Centralized Hodl. And we both agree that's worse than banks. I believe that scalability is a much more serious problem than privacy. Privacy is a social construct. There are degrees or privacy. But can you ever truly be private? The truth is: you don't know. It depends how much effort a third party is willing to put in order to trace back your footsteps. If someone i.e. a government wants to track you, you better believe they're not going to look at your blockchain life. They're going to look straight at your door. Your phone, your radio even. Even sound outputs may be used as terrible microphones - most people have no idea and most people don't need to be engineers either. Most people are boring and not worth being looked at. The economics of privacy will never be extinguished. How valuable are you to get looked into? As long as you're somewhat valuable to get looked into, that market will exist.
edit: 
tldr: Stop trying to solve markets. Start trying to solve scalability and making our coin usable.

what if bitcoin is not to be used like that while the functionality ain't built yet?  
Bitcoin already beats gold flat out of the ground at mostly every aspect that gold has that conceives it value. If the same amount of $ flew around in gold every day, you'd probably waste more oil than that gold's worth just to carry that gold around. That is: if you even could move that weight of gold in the same time it takes to move BTC.  
So yeah maybe it gets there and maybe it doesn't. Even if it doesn't, it's still \*already\* great. Still better than any fiat. Still Cantilon Effect resistant. Still all of the rest. Scalability isn't really needed for mass adoption. No, not really. They're doing it anyway and I don't mind.

in the future or in the past, as long as it has not yet been exploited, making it public only achieves more loss for the people who bought the hardware. So if there's any exploit possible, which, most likely there is, it won't be made public at all. Because there's no way of assuring that:
1) all the public would even comprehend what was happening.
2) the wrong hands don't get to use it before the few that comprehend.
3) there would be any possible fix.

Not in the slightest. This is a way that the network has of becoming ever more robust. Big hashrate is not meant to be concentrated in one place. The owners should have had perfect awareness of the risk that implied. If they didn't, now they do. These nodes will be replaced by ones that are newer and more decentralized hopefully. If not, the same risk will always be present. And that's a feature, not a flaw.

So now instead, you live every day in fear that ledger purposely put a backdoor in their hardware or signed transactions with your private key before installing it on the hardware and has them ready for use, waiting for the D day when they send out from all ledgers without even needing to have them connected to anywhere at all.

yes, it should serve the state, however the separation between banks and state has become ever dimmer, and that's why we have this modern slavery.

bro I'm so sorry, I don't want to cause fear in you. My point is rather to raise awareness. Even I use the ledger. There's no bullet proof alternative. I honestly would've gone for Trezor because they seem more keen on hearing the community and doing stuff the right way. The most safe you can be I guess, would be installing a full node and signing a transaction with the private key that node generates. That undeniably proves it's yours (you follow, Craig?).   
Format writing over the disk partition on a virtual box before and after. On a freshly installed Linux. Download the blockchain then **verify.** It's how I'd go about it to have maximum certainty.. and even then... you'd be trusting the hardware provider on your computer/laptop + printer if you're gonna print the paper wallet. I'm fine with this level of fear. I shouldn't be. One day I'll run my own node but first is university and getting my life together.   
I'm mostly sure you'll do fine. We'll do fine. And I certainly hope that your savings can afford you the life that you want to live. Always check if it isn't possible that you're already there. Maybe you're blessed already but you're just not aware. You might very well have many things that no sort of money could buy - in many ways.

Also, if they were incompetent at any point, that information would be top secret (not by corporate greed or malice but rather for your very safety) and just new iterations of the hardware would be updated. So you'll never know if your version in specific is a compromised one.. Which is fricked, to say the least.
Yes, I've spent a lot of time thinking about this.

BANANO. I've actually donated to people in the banano Discord. They've fed like 5 people with just $1 and I was really happy that day. It was my first use case for crypto in general. I'd honestly never send them btc because that's like my reserves. If I want to send anything to anyone I send stuff that is free to transact.

did I somehow end up on Signal over noise. Try agreeing on something and move on from there. Share your assumptions. Don't forget that some folks are reading and actually trying to educate themselves.

They didn't pay their devs enough. For sure.. And the devs are just the most important part to make an exchange work. I have asked and apparently on their telegram, the mods start by working as volunteers. You see. when you don't pay your staff social vulnerabilities become an actual incentive. If they do this for telegram, then obviously they'll not necessarily have them work for free but definitely underpay them. They did well. In my ledger, robbing a bank doesn't equate to robbing.
