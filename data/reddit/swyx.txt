what did the SEC stand to gain from dragging it out to the last minute? I'm sure* they're not intentionally trying to look like giant dickwads
*I'm not sure, I just hope... trying to look for a "real" reason instead of assuming incompetence

what exactly did you use it for and why did that ease surprise you?

at the same time, no one has really explained the demand either

thats kind of the problem with bitcoin and dreams of mass adoption. it needs to be a hell of a lot simpler or it will never be trusted

ok but aren't they also factually right on the blocksize issue?

i feel like i want to do this just to learn about the inner workings of bitcoin, not necessarily to mine long term. but at the same time im not exactly sure what inner workings there are to learn..

says who? do they offer an insurance policy against being hacked? no

to me it seems obvious that smart contracts have more financial value. as balaji said in the video above the whole goal is to enable a ___coin based economy. why would people want a coin (bitcoin) that they can't spend due to long confirmation times and transaction costs?
