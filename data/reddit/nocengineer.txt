PayPal has their own chargeback feature, that's probably why they also require identification verification (so you don't come back a day later and claim you were hacked or got your identity stolen and want your money back).
Is bank transfer or cash really not a good enough option? (not asking to be a dick, just genuinely curious seeing how using someone else credit card is generally frowned upon/illegal)

Have you tried  ?
I know they don't mention credit cards, but credit card is kind of a hassle when selling bitcoin, because the buyer can use VISA/Mastercards chargeback feature and get their money back (while the seller has no way to revert his bitcoin transaction).

Take the cash to the bank and get money in your account, then use that money to buy bitcoin? Or do you have some need that prevents you from taking legally aquired money into a financial institution like a bank?

Did you use vipps with a commercial bank account? Bitcoinsnorway seems to use a five digit phone number to accept money, which probably means they're registered as an organization, which might be different from all the private persons selling bitcoins through vipps.

Knowing BitcoinsNorway, I agree, and they might even have sent out the e-mail right before a weekend just to get a few more days uptime before they get shut the fuck down (in the hopes that people would remember their name even though they don't offer Vipps (or PayPal/Visa like they also tried in the past)).
That said, take Sturle for example. He's selling bitcoin through his website bitmynt.no, according to news interviews he's done he's already made at least 1 milliion NOK in a year selling bitcoin, and he clearly have no problem using DNB bank transfers (he asks you which bank you have so he can give out a bank account number from the same bank and speed up the transaction), but **he also clearly states that your anonymity goes straight out the door if the police or other law enforcement agencies come knocking** (but he recently refused a news outlet information because of that anonymity), so who knows? Maybe DNB doesn't have a problem with BitcoinsNorway as long as they follow their own rule about corresponding names (your account name and bank account name must match).
Vipps works with other (Norwegian) banks too, so they might just have tried that to get around the ban. At least DNB isn't completely anti-bitcoin, they just don't want it used through Vipps (if you're not a commercial entity).
@_date: 2016-11-28 01:50:57
Bitcoinsnorway seems to have mentioned on their Facebook that the reason they can use Vipps is because they themselves don't sell bitcoins, they just fascilitate buying and selling on their exchange, so it's their customers who actually sell you bitcoin, and not them.
I doubt DNB is gonna care much about that technicality..

Hiding money is a pretty big part of laundering money, and yet you're one hundred percent certain they're only anti-bitcoin because of fraud (even when they claim money laundering concerns themselves). If that's not an subjective opinion, I don't know what is..
The fact that DNB has done their part in hiding money for tax purposes in the past doesn't mean they're forever and always in the "we want to help you launder money"-camp.
If you really can't see how bitcoin could help someone launder money on a huge scale, then I don't think you really understand what money laundering is, or at least not how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2016-11-27 09:51:27
Chargebacks are possible, but then you'd have to claim you got your identity stolen, which means new credit cards etc (as in a major hassle). The reason DNB banned bitcoin sales through vipps (at least for person to person sales) was apparently because of money laundering concerns. Bitcoinsnorway seems to receive money through a 5 digit phone number, so they might (and I stress that word highly) have a commercial deal where they've found a solution to the money laundering concerns.
@_date: 2016-11-28 01:48:59
That's still your subjective opinion. You could be 100 000% certain and it would still only be your personal opinion.
@_date: 2016-11-28 08:07:17
Look at my argument, mainly:
- DNB themselves claim it's because of money laundering concerns. They are the source. You are far from the source and less believable.
- Bitcoin could easily be used to launder money, banks who break the law and help their customers launder money risk getting huge fines or loosing their operating lisence (konsesjon fra Finanstilsynsynet), which sure as shit would affect their bottom line.
At this point I have to ask; Do you actually believe laundering money wouldn't affect a banks bottom line? Even if they make more money than they get fined, risking their license to operate is pretty fucking hardcore for any bank to do willingly.
If you honestly believe laundering money wouldn't affect a banks bottom line, then I have to believe you're obviously trolling and just ignore you.
@_date: 2016-11-27 09:46:44
Actually DNB stated they banned it because of money laundering issues, not fraud. If money laundering is all they're afraid of, then they could hold a commercial deal with bitcoinsnorway where names are logged/shared to prevent that sort of thing. That said, it wouldn't be the first time bitcoinsnorway launched "something no one else is offering" just to have it yanked back due to not doing their research before implementation.

And unless you've already heard of that casino, you can't even read the name. I assume the first word is Dragons, even though only DR......ONS is visible. What's the last word in the thumbnail? Tone? Tale? Tate? Tote?

The article doesn't even mention any casino by name, nor does it seem to link to any casino that accepts bitcoin..

I already said why, and OP had his own reason for why it made sense. I did it because it was a Saturday and I couldn't wait until wednesday when the bank transfer would have been done, so I bought on eBay and paid instantly with a credit card through PayPal. OP was in a similar bind where he didn't wanna spend 50 USD like a lot of exchanges require. You risk being scammed everywhere, eBay included, and I told him it wouldn't be cheap up front. If I've managed not to get scammed 3/3 times (and the first time it wasn't even allowed to use PayPal to buy BitCoin, but that didn't stop the seller or me from doing a deal), then it should be more than possible for OP too. You say there have been countless eBay scams where 100% feedback eBay sellers have scammed someone, and I would really like to see what you're basing that on, because it really sounds like you're pulling that out of your ass.
@_date: 2015-03-15 06:09:34
I know the margin the take is horrible, but what else makes eBay the worst place to buy bitcoin (now that PayPal doesn't block sellers for selling cryptocurrencies)?
@_date: 2015-03-15 06:19:32
As I mentioned initially, the pricing absolutely sucks if you buy bitcoin through eBay, but the few times I've been forced to buy there (2 or 3 times?) because I didn't plan ahead and transfer money into my primary exchange, I've had no issue with scams. Like everything on ebay, only buy from sellers with ~100% rating, and you'll be fine.
@_date: 2015-03-15 05:55:35
I'm not saying this is cheap, but eBay? I would give you better links, but I just buy bitcoin from Norwegian exchanges, and I doubt you have a (verified) Norwegian bank account.
