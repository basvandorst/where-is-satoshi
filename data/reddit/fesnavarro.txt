Until yesterday I was able to see the balance but not to claim online. Now I can't see the balance and also the message to reset password on claim changed from "error bla bla bla" to "username/e-mail incorrect" 
Okey okey I give up and will fill it offline. Anyone knows where on this form I can insert the btc address where will be send the funds ?

I keep counting ... So far are more than 168 hours for a withdrawal of Bitcoin. And you guys retook the value without sending me any emails about. 
I just keep my bitcoins there to trade... But I never trusted let my Bitcoins with nobody, and you guys are the proof that I'm right. I must know everything that happen with my account. Always!!

I would like to go there also. But I'm not so patient like you. I pretty sure I would break everything or at least Mark face. Also I would follow him like a ghost if I lose my money by bitcoin crash if they give me that late enough to see another shitcoin exceed bitcoin. ( the last one is impossible but, some people actuality has less then 80 IQ to buy them)

I'm using always the same address trough the blockchain.info. The address are pasted on the comment title   
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:26:05
I withdrew 59btc and 40btc 27 and 28 January follow. 
Then both came back to my account after 7 days.
Then I tried again with just one transaction of 99, and still not working. But yesterday they answered me with this text above. So now I couldn't understand this. I don't know maybe I'm not so claver or my English is not enough to.
