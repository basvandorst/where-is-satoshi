Not having the capability is not the same thing as not having the risk.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:55:24
Is that supposed to be impressive? Did you complete the python class on codecademy too? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:34:59
Also not a decentralized system in the same way btc was intended.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:31:09
Kinda think Bitcoin needs to worry more about its tech than brand at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:29:17
Well yeah, because he isn't a decentralized system. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:04:10
I didn't go through your history, its just not really impressive to throw buzzwords at someone also in the industry and that knows what you do isn't as complicated as you'd like to think, nor does it bolster your opinion about a cryptocurrency naming convention.
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:51:01
Yeah, I’m the one acting like my shit doesn’t stink because I have a job.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:09:56
I mean, *technically* hash functions have collisions, so *technically* they are duplicable. 
edit: hash

..... lol
If anything? Ether WILL overtake BTC. Idk if BCH will, because I'm not convinced the technology is better - but BTC ruined itself afaic

@_date: 2017-12-28 21:54:35
okay, ill bite. what value does it have outside of currency?
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:28:36
welcome to r/bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:07:12
Yes, that would be bitcoins value as a currency...
Also bitcoin is not anonymous.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:40:01


Yeah, no. BTC is not an abstraction of a commodity, lol. It has no inherent value itself that would render it useful outside of a medium of exchange.  I also don't think you know what juxtaposed means. 


Right, all id have to do is follow the pretty obvious blockchain to find where things go. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:08:09
Gold absolutely does have a point as a tangible precious metal.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:59:03
I mean, there already is better technology, and adoption has been really hurt by transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:14:44
Thats not adoption of a currency though, its just speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:53:09
such a pointless shitpost
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:10:13
What a silly thing to ask. Do you think the holders of any company stock care about what that company sells/makes/provides as long as they stay profitable? The question is not if they care about what makes something valuable, only that there IS something that makes it valuable. As I've said before, BTC is only valuable as a currency. It has no other use case whatsoever, without that - it is void of value.
I'd done with this conversation - you are incredibly condescending for someone who clearly has no idea what they are talking about.
 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:37:40
Yeah but BTC is only worthwhile as a currency. Even the blockchain tech doesn't inherently make BTC valuable as anything other than proof of concept. Gold has worth in and of itself as a precious metal, so assuming that BTC will become the same seems baseless. 
and no, buying and selling high risk stock/btc/etf/any commodity future with the goal of beating the market is the definition of speculative investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:52:40
No, lol. Gold has value in the making of jewelry, its non corrosive, easily malleable. 
I mean sure, any thing is only worth anything because someone is willing to pay for it, but at the most basic level, gold has more usefulness than BTC, and isnt dependent on the blockchain network or electricity/technology to have that value. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:42:09
They actually use it as jewelry because its malleable and non corrosive as well as rare. Its a raw material, just like other commodities. BTC is actually worthless, in that by itself it is nothingness.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:08:00
In no way does that make profit certain.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:42:58
uh... 
Ledger, Trezor, Jaxx, Coinomi are all pretty easy to use.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:37:22


......... we already have that.............
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:19:38
The claim that "most altcoins have no actual use" is either incredibly ignorant or an intentional spread of FUD for whatever reason.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:00:36


@_date: 2018-02-22 21:55:27
LOL thats all BTC is being used for
EDIT: and filled already? are you kidding? BTC still cant scale, and the transaction fees JUST came back to earth. Still not anonymous, either.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:41:11
an index is a measure of certain stocks, so no - its not completely different. 
*more facepalm*
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:28:54
This isn’t worth my time anymore.
If you claim that monero and ether are the only other coins with active communities and legitimate use cases then you’re either blind or lying. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:15:33
That isn’t what you said though.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:43:03
Look, I understand you're a BTC shill. I get it.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:38:58
you people make me sad.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:39:34
please read


@_date: 2018-02-21 20:34:09
*sigh* 
I mean, okay, sure - plenty of altcoins are shit and plenty are even scams, but you're statement wasn't meant to warn someone about the large amount of risk in altcoins, it was meant to portray the idea that nothing but BTC has a usecase, and that is patently false.


Wanna bet? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:59:47
No. No. No.




BTC went from ~$800 to ~$17,900 in 2017 and you really think people thought bitcoin was dying? 
This sub is sad sometimes. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:12:40
You've said elsewhere in this thread that 99.9% of alts are scams. You're using semantics to backpedal from the spirit of your original comment, which was the posit that nothing but bitcoin had a usecase, which simply isnt true. Bitcoin integrating other tech into itself doesnt mitigate the usefulness of other coins.
You still wont respond to my offer of betting you on your altcoin comments. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:18:32
Ticker Name, Duh. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:30:46
Maybe, but not in this metaphor.
