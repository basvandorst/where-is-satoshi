Oh how I woe barriers of entry.
I up voted you because I agree with your take on vpn and bitcoin.
The argument of charge backs is a fair one. However fraud is inherent in any system. 
Consumers are also at risk of fraud with bitcoin. What if my vpn is not delivered? This is a question that I am sure has been answered elsewhere so I hope it does not overtake this thread.
Fraud with bitcoin will be different though. You don't need to use your stolen funds to buy goods and fence them, but rather you can keep the funds to yourself safely stored in a piece of paper.
This scares me.
Anyways hope we can stay on topic!

Well I see it like this...
Why give anything to anyone for free ? The more popular btc becomes the  the more people are likely to capitalize on it. Anyone who charges a lower rate will likely do so to increase volume of transactions but ultimately to earn more profit off the users.
And yeah you know I'm sure there are better places but there will always  easy a "fee" for buying my own money. Some more than others and it makes sense..websites/atm/etc all cost capital to maintain. So I see fees as an inevitability. 
Sure bit coin has its other positives but it seems like it lacks in the competitive advantage of price
Also not happy that the website accepted only btc. Was not easy.

Remember though in this case there was not only a premium on the currency exchange, but also a 5% premium on the converted total.
