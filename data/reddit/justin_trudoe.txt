Oh like the post about the guy that off’d himself because of the opportunity cost associated with selling his btc early? Lol

@_date: 2017-12-01 17:27:12
You’re an idiot lol. Why not just use your paycheques to buy bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:36:24
I have about 10k in eth and $100 in chequings.  I keep enough in my chequings for a space helmet for when we land.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:33:16
Thank you for that perspective and insight.

I think his question was eluding to literally the exact opposite of "answers for basic questions"

Sry this is Reddit 
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:00:53
You're right I totally should have asked this in a private sub that everyone knows about, my bad.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:12:23
Whatever nerd how do I deposit more into kraken 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:03:43
Cute 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:41:08
So eth?

@_date: 2017-11-16 19:08:56
What do you consider "significant funds"?

Clearing out room for lambo I assume
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:21:30
That's not a very good question for Reddit
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:29:27
Yeah because the round number of $10,000 USD is applicable to the entire world.  And since it's MURICA they ONLY follow the US dollar. Lmao get over yourselves
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:20:34
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:52:38
It’s upside down.
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:50:54
Awesome thank you for your insight 
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:08:36
So would you say it makes more sense to keep my bitcoin in kraken vs an offline wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:01:04
How much are you guys withdrawing? I took out 1btc in 2 hrs 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:46:49
Can someone explain why everyone is telling people to take their btc out of kraken prior to the fork? If I have 3 btc in kraken and as of aug 1 I will have 3btc + 3bcc I don't understand the proposed risk.
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:40:24
I understand the benefits of using a hardware wallet, I guess my question was more so re: if I keep my bitcoin off an exchange like kraken, will I still obtain an equal amount of bcc come august 1st?
