Looking for some pros and cons, mainly some help indicating if this is a good idea or a bad idea.  I have the money to spare, and I am comfortable with the idea that I may not make a fast return on that investment.  But would it be better just to buy some coin?  I like the idea of a passive income generating me some cash.

Ugh, I know the one of the peole that started the bitcoin for pizza website.... I hate them now for not telling me to get involved.

So you just wait and it eventually comes back? That simple?  Do I need to hit the Delete Unconfirmed Transaction button?

9 hours later and this is sitting at 18 comments.  Guess you got at least a dozen and a half.

I put in about 1300 when it was at 1600, and have been adding bits here and there (20 here, 30 there).  overall I feel like im winning.  Just glad that initial investment went in when it did.

I will say i saw it hit 659, so your at least close.....
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:53:40
