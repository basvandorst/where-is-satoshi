Great question - I've been thinking about this too. I'd like to see discussion from someone who actually recently cashed out significant bitcoin and then moved that cash from the exchange to a bank account. I'm guessing you can't just drop that kind of cash into your average savings and loan where most of us have accounts.

Interesting that the CME news tomorrow isn't slowing down BTC's rise.

No prob! Good luck on your trades! :)

Hang in there. It will rise again and you'll make some money. If possible, use any spare cash to buy in now while its down.

BTC/USD 1 hour candles forming triangle pattern. Breakout coming? With cryptos, you never know...
EDIT: about 3 hours later we're getting a nice little breakout to the upside. Hopefully, it keeps going!
EDIT 2: about 3 hours later. Annnnddd.... Back to ranging again.

Yesterday on GDAX, bitcoin was in 'The Battle For Eleven Three'. Today, it's 'The Battle For Eleven Five'. Forward, troops! 
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:51:59
If you're going to buy today, watch your order book close so you can jump in at a good time. But you'll probably have to wait a while to make any profit on £100. Still a lot of fun watching the price battles though - welcome aboard! 
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:07:12
I wonder if this has anything to do with the sudden 150 point jump...

A few more hours until Asia enters this battle. Hopefully, it will be fun!

Will be interesting to see how Asia treats this low priced bitcoin when they come online soon.

If you're a US citizen, you may want to look at IRS form 8949. (I am not a tax specialist.) If you've incurred considerable loss/gains, save yourself future tax issues and consult an accountant.

Respectfully Goldbergger, on the 1 day BTC chart (GDAX), there seems to be movement AWAY from a death cross. And price has risen substantially from $7300 to $8900 in the last 8 hours. 
Granted anything could happen in bitcoinland...
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:34:17
Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:28:47
Respectfully, if I'm reading that right, if you draw channel lines, you have a lot of room to rise. Of course there's a lot of room to fall, too - as you called...
It will be interesting to see what happens when Asia wakes up...
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:10:13
Some states getting on board?

Am I correct that trading volume is really low? I wonder why it's so slow.
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:32:54
Interesting. Can you explain the verticles a bit more?
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:06:39
It's a buy/sell technique to move your order to the front of the line. Many people like to buy/sell at a psychological 'whole number'. By upping/lowering it a penny, you get ahead of all those orders. This works to your advantage if there are a ton of orders for the same price but not enough pressure to get them all settled.

Interesting because the weekends have been miserable but maybe the price is so low now that buyers are coming. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:13:04
Are those lower highs and higher lows indicative of a triangle breakout pattern? 
And which direction? 
We'll see...

I've had no issues with Coinbase and it's easy to use for a newbie.

This latest bull run coincided with the news that Soros, the Rockefellers, and the Rothschilds were getting on board. This may be big institution money.

This video should explain how to trade on Coinbase without fees.

Big bearish pinbar forming on the 1 hour GDAX BTC chart. Anyone else seeing it? 
EDIT - so much for that bearish candle, bitcoin is unstoppable today!  :)
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:33:46
On my iPhone, I can log into Coinbase and both watch charts and trade. It's not an app, just the website that I'm logging into. \(I think Skipper may have answered this below, though\) :\) 
Regardless, I understand wanting to trade from your smartphone. It's super convenient. Good luck on the trades!

There have been a lot of posts on taxes. Here's another article I hope helps. In my unprofessional opinion, it seems the best idea - as far as preparation goes - is to log every crypto transaction with as much detail as possible. If you do spreadsheets, this is probably the best option. But a simple notebook and pencil can't hurt either. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:48:42
Congratulations! That has to feel good after weathering the last few weeks.

If you're new, don't buy anything for a while. Take 90 days and read everything you can find on cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and trading in general. Study the charts, too. (I like the charts on GDAX) With the charts in front of you, make pretend trades. See if they would have worked. Note why they did or didn't work. Learn from your 'mistakes' or 'successes'. You should have a lot of pretend positive trades under your belt before you make your first real one. When you finally do trade, start very small (using money you can afford to lose) and increase your trade sizes as your successes increase. Remember: buy low sell high. Watch this guy's posts for a while, he's pretty good:
