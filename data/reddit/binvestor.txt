It really looks like there are two sides to this debate(s): One side simply wants to scale Bitcoin on-chain with bigger blocks and off-chain with LN. The other side is trying to divide, dissent and split by steering argument and drama. No proposed compromise or consensus agreement will ever be accepted if the goal is to divide. How to help unite?

the quote says:


What does "generate" mean? Generating *blocks* would mean that only big server farms would do the mining. The rest would only verify. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:42:10


That's why activation also requires supermajority. If an input is three blocks old the probability of it being invalid is smaller than 5% of 5% of 5% and further decreases exponentially. Not perfect, but the best approach so far.

not sure what you mean with "this side" ;)
Please let's not "divide" the community based on opinion. There is no wrong nor right. There are only trade-offs. The whole spectrum of opinions is healthy.
We might disagree on trading off priorities, but we both want to further Bitcoin. Hence we are on the same side :-) Please let us not get emotionally entangled just because some agitating trolls argue aggressively to further divide us. Such provocateurs can be found in all subs (pretending to) representing all opinions.

That we both don't know the bandwidth requirement doesn't make it less a fact. It's objectively reproducably measurable.


Everyone checking every of everyone else's txns in a peer-to-peer network does obviously not scale very well. The challenge (not the problem) has always been: Can it scale big enough to create enough value that it can support itself? The costs to run the network sufficiently securely have to be paid for with fees if  Bitcoin was to become self-sustaining in the long run. The challenge is to scale txn throughput without compromising the p2p nature, the core value proposition that is trustless money. 


This is what I do not understand. How does SegWit make hardforks harder? (except in that it alleviates the immediate capacity need) and Why must it be a hardfork at all? Isn't it about the txn capacity anymore? SewgWit does increase the txns per block.
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:18:56
yes it's all about opinion, not facts. Otherwise there would be agreement :-) If something is truly objectively measurable then everyone will reproduce the same results. E.g. being a trustless peer (full node) nowadays requires hundreds of gigabytes of traffic per month. Can be regarded "fact". Nobody claims different. But it is an opinion that the ability to be your own trustless bank should not be traded off because this monetary sovereignty is what Bitcoin is all about - the "core" value proposition that gives bitcoin value.

Now I really want to know what the minimum bandwidth requirements are. Any pointers to anyone who actually measured it? Probably transfering actual blocks amounts for the least traffic in a peer-to-peer network.


Why do you believe this? I remember many years ago thinking that Bitcoin can not scale any further. But ways have been found to scale far beyond what I thought was technically possible. And there are still more ideas coming to get us even more scale. There is just concern to move carefully and not compromise what makes Bitcoin work / secure.
You outline an interesting 20MB long term vision for Bitcoin. Currently about 5% of miner revenue is fees. That means with twenty times transaction throughput Bitcoin would be self-sufficient without block reward subsidies (assuming todays fees). Demand grows over time, technology grows over time, block reward fades over time. So why not increase the block size over time? Starting with SegWit?
@_date: 2017-02-06 07:45:06
SPV clients have to *trust* full nodes. This is not *trustless*.
*Trusting* third parties is only secure *enough* as long as there are *enough* (honest) full nodes in the network. Only if the *cost of node operation* (CONOP) stays low *enough* to run full nodes on  average internet connections, only then can we *trust* the network as a whole to be secure *enough* to use SPV wallets.

yes, nothing to do with SW. The goal is to divide, split and fork.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:50:26
Yes, Bitcoin simply staying as it is does increase trust in its stability and manipulation-resistance. Immutability is its greatest strength.
But it is tempting to just *fork* all these annoyances away. Though there would probably be new issues to argue, divide and create drama... In case of a fork nobody wins (except those who want Bitcoin to fail). If Bitcoin proves immutable does this mean all innovation needs to happen above the base protocol layer?
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:42:26
This is obvious to see. Insults do not help. It just agitates others.
It does not matter if it's true or not. We all want cheap fees. We all want to scale. OP actually makes a good point for activating the best trade-off proposed so far. At some point (fee) pressure will be high enough for SegWit to go through.  
@_date: 2017-02-12 08:53:24
the *true* true cost of txns is the cost of running the whole network divided by the number of transactions.
Mining, power, hardware, nodes, etc.. all for 3 txn/sec. This is much much more expensive than simply *trusting* a single company to do all txns. This is the *price* we pay for having *trustless ungovernable money*. If Bitcoin would become too centralized (to make it cheaper) it would still be much more expensive (to run) than visa but it would loose its distinguishing property that sets it apart and that Bitcoin is all about.
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:49:58
"Paper" version means *trust* in an issuer. Lightning otoh is (almost as) *trustless* as Bitcoin.
You can think of it as zero-conf payments but with *trustless* guarantees. A Lighting payment is mathematically proofable secure (without having to *trust* anyone) under the additional assumption that you are "sufficiently online".
In a sense we trade off *offline-ability* for cheap instant txns and get financial privacy as a side benefit.
@_date: 2017-02-22 15:51:27
Why *split* the community into two sides based on opinion? All points of view are valuable contributions. It's ok to think differently. Being informed is how we make up and change our minds... except if we become emotionally entangled?  This is divide vs stay united.
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:27:07
Everyone wants to scale on-chain  (except those who want to stall and split)
The only differences are how *scale-able* the chain is. *Financial transactions* as the core value proposition is of course much more scale-able (see paypal). *Monetary sovereignty* otoh might not scale as well. Fact is we don't know. That's why it seems reasonable to approach the limits of scale-ability slowly and with care and focus on finding technological solutions to *increase* the scale-ability of *monetary sovereignty*. There are no perfect solutions. Only trade-offs.
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:08:31


You run **your** node to verify **your** txns. If you do not use SW txns you don't need to verify them


not arbitrary. It does better align fees with the actual costs to the network.

You've made me curious, What is the smallest minimum bandwidth needed to use Bitcoin trustlessly? ~ 4 GB / month sounds really small. Did you measure that? or calculate it? It's barely enough to just download every block exactly once without any other communication (overhead). How can you be sure that there are no other competing blocks out there? Whom do you trust to provide you the "right" next block if you block all other peers? Monthly bandwidth is an objectively verifiable fact. We can find this out.
Your opinion on controlled offchain solutions and fungibility I share that. I'm all for a careful block size increase to get more capacity and more real facts. This way we can find out the undisputable technical limits determined by laws of physics. At some point we will have to make trade-offs though. Obviously onchain can not scale infinitely. Before we let onchain become controlled and unfungible it would be better to trade off trustlessness offchain. The exciting thing about LN is that even offchain we can retain (almost) the same trustless guarantees by trading off offline-ability..

It looks like there is:
*one side* discussing trade-offs on how best to scale (on-chain as well as off-chain)
*the other* side tries to provoke, escalate, polarize, divide and split (whatever topic)
Both sides use any communication channel available. The whole spectrum of opinions can be found on both sides. There are big blockers and hard forkers as well as small blockers and soft forkers on both sides. It is not about block size and dezentralization. This is about divide and stall or move on united.
@_date: 2017-02-04 09:02:12
LN can be seen as putting funds in *shared wallets* and then  (re)arranging who owns how much - offline and in private - in a sense *trustlessly* combining and delaying transactions to the blockchain.
The shared multisig wallets are called *payment channels* and (re)arranging who can access what funds is done with *hashed time-lock contracts (HTLC)*. All this is *trustless*, i.e. if your friend e.g. gets hacked, the thieve can only access the $20 out of a channel (close), but he could block others funds for some time.
The mathematical security guarantees are (almost) as strong as with ordinary on-chain txns but every participant needs to be online which is less secure than cold storage. Similar to savings account vs checkings account you are trading this off to gain instant payment verification, better financial privacy and less fees, since not every peer on the network needs to verify every single txn you make. 
A sidechain is a separate blockchain with a potentially different security tradeoffs. E.g. cheaper txns but less censorship resistance. It piggybacks on Bitcoin's network effect though.
@_date: 2017-02-13 07:01:28
Indeed. *gravity-of-contribution* effect and *stupid-tax* at its best.
Since most quality contributions tend to *gravitate* towards the repository where most quality contributions *gravitate* to, it becomes harder and harder to continually redo separate changes on top of the latest quality code without contributing back upstream. Looks *stupid* but valuable lesson.
@_date: 2017-02-12 09:34:16
Yes, there is no right nor wrong. There are only trade-offs.
Preserving the *trustless* ungovernable nature of Bitcoin is what sets it apart. Trading off *trustless* ungovernability for cheap fees would make it loose its distinguishing feature and still be much more expensive than paypal.
Let's scale as much as the chain is *able* to *scale* safely.
At the same time do 2nd layer tech that increase the overall *scalability*, i.e. make Bitcoin orders of magnitudes more *able* to *scale* (w/o loosing *trustless* ungovernability).

LN offers instant payment verification, cheaper fees and better privacy. The downside is you *have* to be "sufficiently" online to use it (or *trust* that there will be other people online *for you*). *Offline-ability* is traded off for trustless private cheap fast payments.
Technically Bitcoin txns are send around (offchain) in private without publishing them to (get mined into) the blockchain (yet). This takes load off the chain and results in faster payments and cheaper fees. Coins are held in so called *payment channels* which are just *2-of-2 multisig wallets* that can only be accessed together. Who owns how much of these shared wallets can then be changed with private transactions. *Llightning payments* are then routed multi-hop through a network of such channels.
Compared to custodian offchain solutions (that do not require you to be online) LN is fully *trustless*, i.e. it works without having to trust anyone. Nobody involved can steal any coins. The blockchain acts as a *trust anchor* like a court/judge, s.t. at any time everyone has Bitcoin txns ready to be published and mined in case anyone breaks cooperation. This has the benefit that payment services can be programmed that do not need a money transmitter license since technically no money is "touched"..
The great challenge imho is how user interfaces will work. The technical details of the lightning protocol are quite complex and not all of these details can be fully abstracted away. Somehow a user must be (able to be) aware and influence which channels to open and with how much to fund channels. The lightning payments that can be made depend on the channels (funding) that are currently open.. In some sense LN makes money more liquid (instant pay) but in some other sense it makes it less liquid: In case a channel counterparty is offline (and can not be pinged online) the money in the channel is locked for some time. To close channels uncooperatively there is a timeout to wait.. There are many open questions regarding user interfaces here..

makes me sad. Why this black and white thinking? I'm not part of any team.


It's about txn throughput? Why so important that it's a *hard* fork? 


Ok, a *Lightning payment* is *not* a Bitcoin txn. You are right. I did never say that "they are equal". The Lightning protocol *uses* the Bitcoin protocol (like http uses tcp). As such Lightning *makes* Bitcoin transactions and *uses* those Bitcoin txns offline (sending them around privately as lightning payments). But because they are not mined in a block (yet) they are *not* Bitcoin txns (yet). With this definition *unconfirmed txns* in the mempool are also not Bitcoin txns (yet).


I never ever heard anyone say anything like this. I only ever heard that as an allegation. It's either discrediting or just misunderstanding. Opinion: Layer two solutions don't need to be facilitated. It just makes (a lot of) technical sense and will be needed at some point.. It's ok if you believe different. Nobody knows the future. It's ok to have different opinions.


Such a number can can never be a "fact". It's all trade-offs. The right number depends on how much security you *believe* the network will need. Nobody knows the threat scenarios that might come. Hence nobody can know how much resilience we might need. When trading off security for cheap fees *my opinion* is conservative. Your *opinion* is more adventurous. Nobody is "right" here.


I said "this is just my impression". It's just feedback how "this community" comes across to *me*. If you think my impression is wrong then I feel sorry.


Maybe it's this. I like balanced talk about trade-offs. There is never black and white. Right and wrong. There are only trade-offs. I like to learn, explore and understand trade-offs. A "public voicement" of one single one sided aspect is annoying and boring in the long run. I heard all these arguments so many times and yes I agree with it. I want onchain too. It is just not the whole picture and there is no perfect solution. Shouting ever louder is repellent. I'm actually happy that there are also moderated places for more balanced discussion like we have here now.


Seufz! All these "rational critiques" have definitely been heard more than enough. It has all been discussed looong time ago on the mailing list and later on reddit. We have to trade off different things against each other that are ALL important. It's delicate to find the "right" trade-offs because nobody knows what will happen exactly. Doing small steps moving forward slowly and carefully sounds right to me. Maybe SegWit is too much. Maybe it should be split into several updates?
Thank You for your patience!
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:42:18


No, I think nobody wants that. Why do you believe this?


Silly definitions games.. LN is just zero-conf with trustless security guarantees. Nobody wants to push you. It's just a possible trade-off you *can* make that opens up new use cases..


Demand depends on *price*. For free txns demand is infinite. For 100$ fee txns demand will be small. The supply is limited by what our technology is capable of without compromising the core value proposition ie monetary sovereignty. Opinions differ in should we enhance technology (first) and how much can we afford to trade-off security.


actually I read a lot of that out of curiosity. I perceive it like an online community seriously trying to find solutions. Not solutions to scale Bitcoin. But solutions to find arguments to publicly criticise and discredit anyone contributing to Bitcoin. Almost as if there would be power to be taken away from the *center of gravity of contribution*, which is a bit funny considering how free software works.. I find the general tone not very constructive, rather the opposite. I like talk about tradeoffs   SegWit happens to be the least bad tradeoff proposed so far.

it depends on the definition of *lightning tx*
if you define a *lightning tx* to be the whole process to make a single payment using LN, then a Lightning tx *is not* a Bitcoin tx.
The Lightning protocol *uses* the Bitcoin protocol (like http uses tcp). During a *Lightning tx* (more than one) real Bitcoin txns get created and privately send around (offchain) along a payment path.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:50:59


Altcoins do not scale any better (if they remain *trustless*). Centralized offchain (ie non-trustless) always existed - missing the single one differentiating (USP) feature that Bitcoin is all about: *trustless monetary sovereignty*. That's the "product" that did not exist before. The price for that product is technical inefficiency. Trading off *trustlessness* makes a lot of sense for many use cases (since more efficient ie cheaper).  *Trustless* is a continuum. As long as there exists the (slow and expensive) maximally trustless option, everyone is free to choose how much *trustless monetary sovereignty* is needed / valued to "buy".
LN is still Bitcoin, so it has its (first-mover advantage) network effect. It's just a (complicated) way to (automatically) *use* Bitcoin. Actually I do manual LN since years: coins in shared wallets and we change offchain who owns how much. It's just a good tradeoff: almost as *trustless* as onchain but *super* fast, rather cheap and private. If we get the userinterfaces right this will be *super* successful (in my humble "opinion"). AND it works on all blockchains that support multisig, timelocks and hashlocks. We can do *cross-chain atomic swaps* (ie trustless shapeshift). LN is an "inter-net", a payment network on top of (a web of) cryptocurrencies...


Totally agree. "Selling" LN as a "solution" for anything is stupid. Nobody (can) know the future. We can not rely on anything we do not know. In my humble "opinion" LN is just the most exciting (beautifully elegant) technology since the invention of Bitoin. It's the first time that I actually can imagine that Bitcoin could actually scale to 7 billion people. Before LN there was no sign of hope that it could ever come close to possibly be able to scale that far without compromising its usp. With LN it's at least possible :-) But nothing to "rely" on (yet).
Uses that do not need *monetary sovereignty* at all can simply use centralized solutions instead of trying to make Bitcoin centralized imh "opinion". Bitcoin is for uses that need/value *monetary sovereignty* enough to pay for its price (which is technical inefficiency ie slow and expensive).


Everyone verifying every of everyone else's transactions scales quadratically. In computer science scale-ability is examined asymptotically mathematically. I'm no expert but I know it's hard enough to make distributed software work at all! Decentralized (ie trustless) p2p means there are adversarial (evil) peers around (hackers) that deliberately try to lie, harm and disrupt the network. You can not know which peers are honest. Is it sufficient if you are connected to at least one "honest" peer for it to be (provably) secure? Or do you need more than half of your connected peers to be honest? I'm no security expert. I do not know which kind of attacks are possible or are being tried regularly. I have no idea what the detailed dynamics are that make Bitcoin secure at all but I understand enough to have great respect for the achievements that made Bitcoin survive that far. "Organic growth" means more *monetary sovereignty* to "buy" for more people. That needs *more* security not *less*. The challenge is to scale *monetary sovereignty*. Scaling payment txn throughput is trivial by simply trading off *trustlessness* but there are enough non-trustless payment systems around for that.


That is not the critique as I understand it. The incentives are such that everyone acting maximally egoistic makes the whole thing "work" (for all of "us"). That's the difficult balance that the *protocol consensus rules* try to strike. If "we" allow a small number of nodes to change those rules such that a large number of nodes can not participate anymore, that delicate incentive-balance would stop to "work".


What will make it into the next release? "Whatever they contribute." ~Torvalds.
You gain influence by proofing trust-worthy, ie not doing what *you* want but doing what *they* (the contributors) want. The web of contributions that influence each other somehow "decides" which ideas win. A core repository maintainer has the responsibility to merge and release what the most influencial contributors "decide" by basing their changes on top of other contributions. If a maintainer "decides" by his own personal opinion that trust is lost and the (core) *center of gravity of contribution* moves to a different repository. "Core" just refers to the repository that most contributors pull from the most (to base their contributions upon). Bitcoin code develops decentralized in  at least 20k+ code repositories. There are also several alternative implementations (protocol consensus compatible).


Yes we could brainstorm lightning UX/UI ideas and start a company instead! Otoh maybe it is not all wasted. The community as a whole becomes much more understanding and as such much more resilient to social engineering. 


Thank You!

Lightning is just a clever way of *using* Bitcoin. We can change privately (offchain) who owns how much in shared (multisig) wallets. LN does this automatically by exchanging signed (zero-conf) bitcoin txns between participants along a payment path in a *trustless* way. At any time anyone can independently publish the latest state (of who owns what) to get it mined into a block.

Sorry this is long again :/ I didn't want to
 Lightning TX
Haha, but, but, but you convinced *me*! A Lightning Tx *is NOT* a Bitcoin Tx (event though I argued (heavily!) the opposite for 1+ year). In database science "transactional" is defined as atomic, consistent, isolated and durable  As such a "Lightning tx" includes the whole process of finishing an irreversible payment using LN. It involves several roundtrips of communication sending around (more than one) Bitcoin txns (plus other stuff) between participants along payment paths. E.g the payment receipt (proof of tx complete) is the preimage to the hash (used for the concatenated HTLCs)... A full *Lightning tx* IS clearly *more* than one single Bitcoin tx.
Actually Lightning *is* just a (complicated) way of *using* Bitcoin (together). It has benefits and drawbacks. It's a trade-off :-) The blockchain acts as "trust anchor" to spawn "webs of (smart) contracts" offchain. The Lightning protocol formally standardizes a way of *using* Bitcoin s.t. it can be automated and (partly) abstracted away from the user. The main challenge will not be routing but the user interfaces... Exciting topic...


I like that idea!  I agree to disagree, but I disagree to being divided. I disagree to hostility and manipulation.


Maybe we identified the "core" difference in our thinking. I believe different.
Transfering blocks is only a very small part in a peer-to-peer gossip protocol. For it to be trustlessly resilient there happens lots of communication between peers. I have no idea of the complex dynamics involved here and the kinds attacks that are probably being tried every day. 20 times block size means (order) 400 times traffic in a quadratically scaling broadcast system. Having failed much simpler distributed systems as a programmer myself I have huge respect for the achievements to have Bitcoin scale so far at all. In my believe system the challenge for Bitcoin is simply to survive. If it just survives it will win epically. Maximizing the chances of survival is the single number one priority. 
I fully respect different views and priorities. If Bitcoin were a startup company the challenge would be to grow faster than competitors. Adoption growth would be the single most important priority. But free software p2p systems are different...


Couldn't say it any better. Humans gonna human. Lots of misunderstandings and unnecessary emotionality and probably fueled and intensified by professional psychological manipulators. It's not big vs small block. It's not bu vs core. It's not sub vs sub. It's not techie nerd vs business entrepreneur. It most probably is anti vs pro Bitcoin. It's harm vs benefit Bitcoin. It's divide vs unite. Whenever a troll makes me angry I should not feel anger for everyone who shares opinion with that troll. 


Funny. I completely perceive the exact opposite: an attempt to remove a functioning meritocratic software project to make it governable and controllable. There are more than five alternative Bitcoin implementations with 20k+ source code repositories. Everyone pulls the (subjectively) most exciting code changes from others and tries to convince everyone else to pull their code. Anyone can contribute. No one can force anyone else to use their code. Contributors whose code get pulled most gain influence - simply because of gravity of contribution : It's lots of extra work to continuously merge updates if you diverge too much. That's why everyone codes in a way to convince as many other people as possible to merge their code. A natural *trust hierarchy* emerges (like page rank) that reflects how much contributions are valued (ie pulled) by others. Trust means influence but not power. Good example: Gavin lost all his influence once he tried to (force) "push" his agenda instead of convincing others to *pull*, leading by example. In open source software the term "core" usually simply refers to the *center of gravity of contribution*.
E.g. XThin has been a good contribution. If it would not have been implemented on a rather diverged code branch it could have made it in!  greatly increasing *trust* in its developers (ie influence). The idea has been convincing enough for others to rewrite it based on the current main branch to have it merged. This is how free software evolves. Nobody has power. Nobody can control anything. Institutions with closed membership and democratic voting is the opposite. Bitcoin evolves organically. Influence is meritocratic like a basketball court.

Sure it is just a question of definitions.
A Bitcoin txn *is* a Bitcoin txn as soon as it's created, regardless if it is published or mined.
A Lighning txn could be defined as more than just (one of) the Bitcoin txn(s) that is being *used*. A Lightning *payment* does several roundtrips of communication between participants along each payment path. The *transaction* could be defined as the whole process of doing a single payment including all involved steps and (more than one) real Bitcoin txns. Although eventually each Lightning payments manifests as ordinary on-chain Bitcoin txn as the long term result. LN is just a write cache. But this channel closing step would not be considered part of a *Lightning txn*, since a Lighnting tx has instant payment verification. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:50:27


a matter of definition. I'm personally agnostic of how to define things, but there is no sense in arguing if we have different definitions. So far (maybe unconsciously) I used the definition of a "Bitcoin txn" to be the data structure. You can create one (offline), you can store it or send it around privately and you can publish it and it might get mined... with this def an unconfirmed "Bitcoin txn" is already a "Bitcoin txn", just not yet mined. I can live with a different definition, as long as we are clear what definition we use.


I think pretty much everyone would reject "artificially choking capacity". That would be stupid. It is used as an allegation from the BU side. Most on the other side simply *believe* that there are *real* physical limits (determined by natural laws of technology). I believe this myself. You do not have to agree with such believes. You should always make your own measurements and tests! But thinking there would be "intentional choking" just makes you look ignorant. If there would be no technical limits of course nobody would ever want to artificially restrict capacity. That would be stupid :-)
Among technical people the question has always been "how far will it scale"? The paper is brilliant, it proofs to work in practice. But it will never scale technically! It has always been clear that there will eventually be a limit where it can not scale without trading off its defining characteristics. So far every time the limit has been reached, some brilliant tricks and optimizations have been found to get even more scale-ability. The people who contributed most to make Bitcoin scale-able so far, are now the people whose opinion is trusted most when it comes to scale-ability questions and trade offs. People who did not contribute much yet are not trusted as much.


It is clear that you do not come from a technology background if you believe this. You probably see Bitcoin from a business perspective. Most of the thinking totally makes sense if Bitcoin would be a startup.


They are free to shout as loud as you want. This is the internet :-) It will just not give them more attention and influence. Quite the opposite. It repels. They simply get spam filtered away and ignored since nobody is obliged to listen to them. This is how free software works. Everyone has the same power. If you want influence,  you need to earn trust by repeatedly proofing trust-worthy. Then others will listen to you and base their contributions upon yours and you will slowly move closer to the center of gravity of contribution and gain influence.. XThin is a (unintentional?) positive example - a valuable contribution that makes people look and listen more..


I feel sorry for you if you feel hate(d).
On "both sides" there are butthurt people seriously believing they have to defend Bitcoin against social engineering manipulation. This is about feelings and believes and has nothing to do with rational thinking. And there are probably on both sides people manufacturing divide and intentionally provoking such feelings. 


Yes, I agree. There should not be any marketing sales pitches. You can not promise anyhing. This is not a company. This is free software. The best ideas will win and nobody has any power to decide what is supposed to be "best" ideas. It is natural selection that decides (like evolution). If your code gets pulled and merged by many other branches that get pulled and merged a lot, then your contributions move closer to the center of gravity of contribution.


Dito! It is so easy to polarize. It's so easy to feel offended. Especially if different cultures of communication clash like free software culture and startup entrepreneurship culture. I respect your line of thinking. In some aspects I do not see it as black and white as you. We can agree to disagree. Thank You!

 "Core" is no centrally organized entity. "They" can't promise/decide/control anything. 
"Core" is simply the emergent *center of gravity of contribution* (...)
Demanding *free software* to "negotiate" and "commit" to agreements is like demanding biological evolution to promise to "develop" purple bananas. Nobody can control the direction of nature. Natural selection decides.

 The percentage of costs that is paid for with fees says a lot. It tells us how  well we are doing in making Bitcoin self sustaining in the long run.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:54:27
Opening a channel can be considered as doing a *prepaid deposit*. For LN to be trustless, all channels along a path need sufficient funding. This way there is a mathematical *proof of solvency* during any step of the Lightning protocol. At any time anyone can publish the current state to get mined into a block.
The trade-off is *offline-ability*. As long as your channel counterparty is *online*, the "deposited" funds can be used to make Lighning txns immediatelly as well as (slower more expensive) ordinary Bitcoin txns (ie cooperative channel close). If a channel counterparty is *offline*, the funds are locked for an agreed time.

The distinguishing feature that Bitcoin is all about is that it's *trustless*, ie it "works" without having to *trust* anyone. If you could no longer run a full node yourself you would have to *trust* other nodes. This only "works" as long as there are "enough" of them. Otherwise security breaks.
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:16:22


that's called paypal. yes it "works". not *trustless* though


you mix up miners with full nodes. The majority of miners hashpower determines the order of transactions. Full nodes determine what's valid.
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:03:07
That's exactly what SegWit does: block increase AND enables LN.
@_date: 2017-02-06 05:12:40
SPV nodes cannot verify validity on their own. They have to trust third party full nodes. In that sense using SPV nodes is not *trustless* Bitcoin since you are trusting third parties. This only works in practice as long as there are *enough* independently run full nodes.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:18:15
That's a valid fear. There are open source projects with rather closed governance models and there have been ambitions to make Bitcoin such. But so far Core consists of thousands of decentralized source code repositories. It's open to anyone to contribute. The code branches that get pulled and build upon the most then eventually become releases. Nobody has any more power than anyone else. Influence comes from *value* of contribution which is measured by how many other developers base their contributions upon it. Core maintainers do only merge and sign releases. They have no power to enforce any agenda.
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:47:07
 LN does not reduce the fees that the miners may collect, it increases their reach into transactions that they could not otherwise serve.
@_date: 2017-03-03 22:39:44


Yes, channels need sufficient funding, ie bitcoin in shared multisig wallets. These coins can be spend with a lightning payment if a path between us exists in the network of channels. Or these funds can be spend with a standard onchain txn if the channel counterparty is online to sign a cooperative closing txn. If the channel counterparty is offline the funds are time locked. How would a user interface look like?


Yes it's magical. A smart contract called HTLC is used for this. It basically says: "you can take this much coins if you show a password within a certain time". Only the receiver knows the password. If someone offers you a HTLC you can safely offer someone else (along the path) the same HTLC without any risk. Your coins can only be taken by showing the password and then you can take your predecessors coins. This way the coins are trustlessly routed through the lightning network similar to how TCP/IP packets travel through the internet.
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:13:53
Yes it's trivial to make code.
But it's not trivial to make it emerge as the most build upon solution.
Core consists of more than 7k source code repositories on github alone.

Why wait for "both at once" if SegWit can be activated right now?
A hard fork needs much more time to do it safely. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:50:05
SegWit *is* a block size increase
soft forks are much safer
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:52:00
Influence in free software simply means: Speak and people listen. Push code and people pull it, read it, test it. They do this because they *trust* that it will be worth it (and *trust* that the code might make it in and they will have to merge it anyway if they do not want to diverge). If you convince lots of people to include your code then you have lots of influence. It is imho the most corruption-resillient social structure we know of (see e.g. linux), but it is definitely not perfect and can be "compromised". Closed governance schemas based on power structures are much much worse though.

This is part of a discussion about ideas. E.g. Bitcoin is a good idea and we don't even know what terrible/good person(s) came up with it. XThin and LN are great Ideas too - regardless who invented it. Ideas speak for themselves.
Gossiping about how bad a person Ver makes himself look like or how bad a character Maxwell is supposed to be, this is childish and immature. It looks silly - like trying to apply politics to free software development.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:12:07
Yes fully agree. Sorry - my point was that the discussion is about *how* to scale. Nobody is arguing that blocks should *never* be enlarged. The question is *when* to do it and *how* to do it safely. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:04:13
Bitcoin is not a company but it needs to compete with other companies on the free market. If transactions become too expensive then nobody will use it and it will fail to grow fast enough to sustain itself
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:15:04
Are there any links/examples of "members of Bitcoin Core openly supporting censorship policies"? This is really hard to believe. I can only find statements strongly speaking against censorship.

Everyone wants bigger blocks.

I'm quite new to investing and only casually involved. But it is really hard, not to be made aware of your issues - so much it is annoying. I'm all for bigger blocks but shouting this load isn't convincing. It makes me doubt more and more.
@_date: 2017-01-23 12:47:37
Makes logically sense. We need to pay for unlimited blocks somehow. The market surely will want unlimited coins.
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:34:41
that's why we need bigger blocks!
@_date: 2017-01-23 12:51:05
Yeah, unlimited coins will pay for unlimited blocks. This is what the unlimited market wants.
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:54:23
but the free market must split the chain and take control of governance. Whatever *they* come up with *we* must be against it to further the divide, regardless how many compromises *they* offer. Reunification would be fail.
@_date: 2017-01-12 18:11:50
Lightning is no *super medicine against everything*. There is no such thing.  There are only trade-offs. Every benefit has its cost because the universe is governed by universal laws of physics. It might propose *super exciting* trade-offs but it must never happen because it could never be governed.
nor monitored nor controlled.
