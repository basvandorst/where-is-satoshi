I just can't really see why you would want to purchase small ticket items using crypto (assuming you are in the developed world).
Honest question: why would you want to use something as arcane as cryptocurrency to buy bagels or your daily cappuccino? My contactless card or apple pay work fantastically well.
On the other hand, I can think of many use-cases for censorship resistant wealth storage. 
Some use cases I can think off the top of my head:
(1) You are from Syria and need to flee war and escape into Europe – however bank transfers into Europe are almost impossible if you are a common Syrian. Bitcoin allows you to take your wealth with you, in your brain, as you escape across the border, by just memorising your twelve word private key.
(2) You are from Venezuela or Zimbabwe – The government has issued capital controls and is devaluing currency by the day. You transfer your wealth into Bitcoin in order to offset capital erosion due to hyper-inflation. When the situation stabilises, you transfer your Bitcoin back into fiat.
(3) You are Saudi billionaire Al-Waleed bin Talal. The government freezes all your assets in a political coup. If you have a portion of your wealth in Bitcoin, you could protect them from government expropriation and anonymously transfer them to associates or family members abroad.
(4) You are whistleblower Julian Assance and have been cut off from the financial system as a way to censor your speech. Bitcoin allows you to have an unbreakable digital "Swiss bank account" that the authorities are not able to reach.

There is no "better tech" in a vaccum, but only better tech for a given use case.
For the use case of censorship resistant wealth storage, Bitcoin has the best tech.
Think about it this way. Assume that you have to store your wealth in a crypto protocol for 10 years without being able to touch it until then.
The rational choice would be to pick the coin that has the highest likelihood of surviving attacks to its integrity over such a long period. This translates to picking the coin which is (a) the most decentralised and has (b) the smallest possible attack surface. 
Tokens that offer very rapid transactions on chain (e.g. Dash, Litecoin) are highly prone to being centralised. This isn't bad if you are just using them to pay for small ticket items, but it's a big risk if you want to be reassured about their resiliency against centralisation attacks. This means that they are worse than Bitcoin for condition (a).
Tokens that are very versatile (e.g. Ethereum, Lisk, EOS) might allow users to do much more than Bitcoin (e.g. smart contracts, DAPPS,etc.), but have a way bigger attack surface than Bitcoin as well (if you don’t believe me, ask Parity Wallet owners…). This means that they are worse than Bitcoin for condition (b).
So if you're looking for the token with the highest transaction output or with the most potential to develop DAPPS, go ahead and buy Dash and ETH. But don't expect them to increase in value as gold 2.0, because that's not what they're built for.
The ideal solution is one in which you have a fundamentally immutable base layer that stores value in a resilient way (Bitcoin) and off-chain layers built on top which integrate additional functionality.

CNBC Fast Money are asking whether we stand by Bitcoin or Bcash, so far we're crushing them (80% for Bitcoin, 20% for Btrash).
Please consider voting, they need to see our numbers and understanding that their viewership strongly condemns Bcash and Vroge:

I personally think Tone is wrong on basically all of his TA, but I love watching his videos regardless because he seems like such a nice guy and a true figher for Bitcoin.

Of course they matter, tens of thousands of people see the results. 
Thinking that PR doesn't matter is precisely what Roger Ver wants you to do.

I respect your position. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:14:47


This is so self-evidently false that I can't believe I need to address this. Gold doesn't get used as currency or a payment tool, yet there is a ton of demand, enough to keep the price relatively stable. The same goes for all kinds of non-gold safe haven assets such as expensive art, precious metals, diamonds, etc. 
 &gt; (inb4 gold... no gold also has quite a lot natural demand besides being a store of value)
I don't want to sound condescending, but I take it you're not very familiar with commodity markets. If you were, you would know that if gold were valued based on its industrial or aesthetic use cases, it would be worth c. one tenth of its current value.


But that's not what the market is saying, it's exactly the opposite. If your statement were true, the market would would destry Bitcoin and replace it with Bcash, Litecoin, Dash, etc. 
Yet, that's not happening. Remember the flippening that never happened? That was the market speaking.
This is a position that has been echoed by most public Bitcoin investors, for example, here's billionaire investor Novogratz making the case of Bitcoin as gold 2.0 on CNBC: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:12:28


Bitch what?
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:19:39
Yeah, he is a legend.
I missed Novogratz's first call on Bitcoin, so when he came back a few months ago saying it was going to $10k, I bought the fuck in.
And here we are.

I've done it, but getting downvoted to oblivion :(

You can simply save the article on archive.is and then post that on reddit, so Roger Bcash Ver doesn't get the adrevenue.

Bitcoin is strong because of the protocol and even more strong because of the community.

If you have the means, please consider purchasing Andreas' books or setting up a small monthly donation on Patreon.
Andreas has given so much to our community and has never expected anything in return, only to be ridiculed by scumbags like Roger Ver. He is a true role model and an example of the impact for good that Bitcoin can have on the world.

Venezuela had an inflation of 2,000% in 2017 ([1]), Bitcoin had an appreciation in value of 1,600%. 
Having a censorship resistant and inflation resistant free bank account that cannot be broken into (if properly secured) sounds like a pretty decent deal.
And when Lightning goes live, they will be able to make near-instantaneous transactions at near-free fees. Like this:

I disagree with you there -- issue with larger blocksizes isn't hard disk, it's internet speed connection. 
For Bitcoin to be truly decentralised, you need to be able to run nodes over poor internet connections (like the ones in, say, Zimbabwe or Venezuela). 
One mega blocks are already pushing it.
My 0.02$.

Sir, please watch this. 
It's Andreas going into a technical explanation on why you can't just make blocks bigger to fix scalability:
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:11:10
You can rewrite the above as:


Do you see where I'm going with this?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:56:11
It will definitely improve the network, but it will do so at the expense of decentralisation. 
I am happy to discuss this if you disagree, but if you haven't heard the arguments, please do consider watching Andreas' video because it's a technical issue which requires a technical discussion.

But none of the usecases I've given you makes the assumption that people will need to flee Japan or France.


I agree with you, if the US government decides to outlaw Bitcoin, this will damage the price substantially. The current price would seem to suggest that it's not going to happen, and as market participants we are able to freely agree with it (by purchasing) or disagree with it (by shorting). I've cast my "vote" by being long but you don't have to agree with me, obviously.
Also, Bitcoin is an asset in its price discovery phase. We had hundreds of years to determine what gold is worth, we only had a few years to do the same for BTC. So it's not surprising if there is some price volatility

Bitcoin made him rich, and he gives back by trying to destroy the value of Bitcoin and steal its brand into his own altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:11:34
I'm not entirely sure that's true.
Retail investors could short on margin, that is true and I agree with you here.
But hedge funds and institutional investors, to this day, have no way of shorting bitcoin while also respecting custodial duty to their investors. 
The latter is the group I'm concerned about, not the former.
Remember that these are the people that pay Jamie Dimon for advisory services.

TL, DR:
* Bitcoin can hit $7,941 and eventually trade higher, Goldman Sachs' Sheba Jafari says in a Sunday note.
* Following last week's news that the world's largest futures exchange, CME, will launch bitcoin futures by the end of the year, bitcoin climbed to a record high of $7,601.53 over the weekend before dipping below $7,000.
* To Goldman's Jafari, reaching that price would mark the third of "five-waves up" for bitcoin, although in July The Elliott Wave Theorist newsletter said bitcoin is "making a final fifth wave from six cents."

Sure thing. I would ask that you first check out this video by Andreas, where he explains the dynamics of scaling:
If it's still unclear, ping me, happy to give you my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:40:59
I respect your opinion and agree with many things you said.
But Bitcoin has made Roger Ver a very, very rich man and he is now repaying the community by doing everything he can to destroy to it (e.g. his appearances on popular media shows claiming that Bcash is the real Bitcoin or that "Bitcoin Segwit" has been corrupted by corporate interest).
This is very nefarious stuff and it harms Bitcoin's reputation, to outsiders and especially newcomers who don't know better. 
Make no mistake, Bcash supporters are doing everything they can to sabotage Bitcoin and harm the protocol's standing, its legitimacy and the work of the developers.
We have a duty to protect Bitcoin from these bad actors.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:16:02
I agree with you -- and I think the Bitcoin community by and large grants him that. I often hear critics of Ver say that they're still grateful for his work, they would just prefer he did not try to fuck us over now.

The easiest thing to do is purchase the BTC on GDAX, purchase a Trezor wallet, transfer your BTC to Trezor and you're done.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:22:15
Not at all - it's just a reference to BTC's price in the early days.
GS is calling BTC price at $7,900 in the short term.
