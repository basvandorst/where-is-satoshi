What about BlockChain.com?

Why does it happened?
@_date: 2018-09-29 16:50:09
But why

I actually did the math wrong lol, I calculated all the possible combinations with each other without repetition
If it's a 12 word seed, there are 142241757136172119140625 possible combinations, which is still large, but not *that* large

Exactly. You should NEVER do it. If BTC crashes for whatever reason they would blame you. 
You don't even know what's going to happen in the future. Neither people that say that BTC is going to moon do

~~2.817104e+128 possible combinations. Oh lord. That's astronomically large.~~
Edit: nevermind, I did it wrong

This is unbelievable. They block verified accounts if they have certain crypto keywords because they assume they're hacked. That algorithm is fundamentally flawed

But can accelerate faster than some lambos for way less price and without burning liters of dinosaur juice

Wait for the new Roadster. The Model S is not really meant to be a sports vehicle. It's a sedan. They're not really comparable.
If the news are true and the new Roadster is going to have 10 rocket thrusters it's going to be unbelievable
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:15:22
That already happened

Is this new? Ninja, the most popular Fortnite streamer right now, began to accept BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC and Nano a while ago

It isn't going to happen every year. There's a limit on bitcoin value.
I'm not saying that it won't achieve a new ATH this year, I'm just saying that because it happened every past year doesn't mean it will happen the next ones

I think that people should be aware that you can't HOLD forever if you want to convert it to FIAT. Until you don't sell, you have nothing. It's useless to say "I had 200€" if your holdings are worth actually 50€. You really never had 200€

You can backup Google Authenticator with Titanium Backup. If you don't want to use an app you can always do a manual copy. The keys for the authenticator are stored in plain text (yes, it's unencrypted) in 
In both cases you'll need root access to read system folders.

Your keys are in the cloud. That's already enough to say it's less secure
