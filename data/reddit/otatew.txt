Exactly.  I am yet to learn of a crypto viable to be used as cash for micro payments.  I am new to this.

I care.  But unable to help.

Yes, I think if more people saw the def con video where they show how wallets are easily cracked, there would be less of a surge.   After reading loads about wallets, I settled on electrum.  But after the def con video, I don't know if the seed word list is a good idea.

What does dollar cost average mean?
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:33:47
There is an earlier one also.
I am thinking of using electrum for long term storage ..let us know your thoughts!

But that is only between two parties that set themselves up for it.  Not for generic purchase of hot beverages at various vendors.

Thank you.  I'm in.

Make a verified copy of TAILS Linux on a USB stick.  It already has electrum on it and nothing is stored on your computer or the stick.  You will need your seed words with electrum when you want to check/use bitcoins.

What is hodl?  I keep on thinking it should be hold.

I don't understand this.  He seems genuine to me.
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:04:00
He was bright enough to be an early adopter.  So far, I don't find anything he says with which I disagree.  Hence my confusion with all the hate.   I will keep an open mind.

I'm not so sure.  I have had many USB sticks fail on me.  I dont trust a hardware wallet for X+ years.  What if you don't use it for five years, and then fails if you try?

@_date: 2017-07-16 21:12:45
Yes, but at this stage is there room for a more favourable coin to take the lead?
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:48:00
I'm new to all this.  Why so much hatred for this guy?  He seems genuine to me.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:44:50
Except it most probably was a ...hard fork.

I have had many usb sticks fail on me.  Also, CD/DVD writables have failed on me.  Copying the files accross many Hard Drives also would be good, since individual files can get corrupt.

Excuse my ignorance.  What is happening in 4 weeks?
