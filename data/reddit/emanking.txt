What you're doing is moving the goal posts. Logical fallacy.  Someone proved you wrong and now you don't like where you put your goals at so you move them to make it harder to make another point even though their example was practically the exact same as yours.

It's really fucking obvious you haven't the slightest clue about Bitcoin or how cyrptos work at all.  
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:44:10
Bitcoin has intrinsic value because of the energy put into it. Energy has MORE intrinsic value than a piece of metal since metal is like impure energy in a more stable state.  The fact that we as a species don't understand and can't harness energy from matter better doesn't mean it doesn't have value.  Kind of like how gold wasn't as useful to the Romans because they didn't have electricity but it had other uses besides currency still.  
You've already been caught using plenty of logical fallacies so your points (or lack of) have absolutely no meaning. You do not have the ability to use logic it seems.
Go home, you're wrong. You're done. Shut up already.

I see your point, but also consider:
What's wrong with a potential customer telling a company what it can do to get their business?  I get that there is a drain on resources, but you could consider it a form of free (or close to free) marketing that the people are willingly giving to the company.  It would normally cost a lot for a company to gather info on a potential product and how much of a market there is for it, arguably more costly than some people responding to emails.

Just ask a simple question.  I admit it's harder to do than saying it, especially for an introvert like me, but all you need to do is just ask; don't even go into explaining it if you don't want.  They might not care to look into it then, but if another person mentions it or if they hear it on the news again, they'll probably get a lot more interested.

Why?  The age of just dismissing "conspiracies" away as silly is over.  We have internal documents from the NSA that describe how they will perform psychological operations over the internet in order to change public opinion and influence ideas in their favor.  We know the government doesn't like Bitcoin.  We know the NSA, DOD, etc have HUGE budgets.  It only took a few NSA agents to start posting all those crazy lies to bitcointalk and start people on the path of thinking that NEO&amp;BEE can't be trusted.  There are NSA agents here right now.  You guys are supposed to be aware of this shit but you are eating it all right up.

Just did the math on this. Assuming a pizza is $10 then with Bitcoin @ 1080 it would cost about 9.25mBtc and  it would cost about 7.5mBtc.  So just be sure you have about $12 in bitcoin and you'll be good. Not a big deal at all. Maybe a small-priced item like pizza is a bad example because with cheap everyday items like that this volatility is almost not noticeable (and that was using the most extreme jump in price from the OP).

It doesn't matter if you bought it at 200, 400,or even 1000 if you don't care about selling it to make a profit, aka, day trading. Buying .4 bitcoin at 1000 will get you just as much stuff as 2btc at 200. And I consider buying things when the price has gone up as another form of day trading.  And if you're keeping bitcoin for retirement then that tiny price change means almost nothing. 
And no, coinbase isn't meant for selling bitcoin at market price at the exact moment you want to hit the price you want. That is called an exchange. Coinbase is not one.

They have a huge supply of bitcoin so there's no need to buy more when someone buys just 1btc.  Also I thought people would have learned by now to never buy bitcoin related hardware that has a price in bitcoin that never changes.  It's your problem as a consumer to decide if this device has suddenly doubled in price for good reason. Buy it if you think it's that valuable, or don't. Coinbase has to protect itself from the government by showing them they have automated scripts to help detect money laundering and other related activities. Sometimes these scripts catch innocent transactions. This is an unfortunate but currently necessary part of being able to use a service like Coinbase. We should be greatful we can buy bitcoin this easily. For the longest time I used MoneyGram and paid a lot in fees.

Changing forms of payment is a lot different from changing your entire business model.  The latter could make or break your company.  The former will just make it easier for some random joe to buy something.  If the company does become very successful it would be because of the product they sell and how they sell it, not because of what payment method they use.  Giving credit to the currency is just a slap in the face for the hard work these people put into the business.

Look at all that hassle.  How dare someone think highly enough of my mental abilities that they think I can accomplish 3 easy steps.  
There are services out there where you can pay for credits, then gift another person with that account.  That person can then chose the gift cards they want and have them sent via snail male.  This is more involved than a Bitcoin paper wallet and you don't get as much bang for your buck because of the "convenience" of choosing your gift cards.  With bitcoin, I can chose to buy gift cards at Gyft, spend it at ANY online store with Snapcard, use it to invest in companies, send it to another account that I control, etc.  Way more useful than a standard gift card or even cash for that matter.

I thought rich people getting away with shit was the norm, is it not?
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:43:02
Ah yes! it's good to see that not even is devoid of the occasional pundit.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:54:43
Yeah I don't get the party about it being slow.  It's instant.  The only time you'd want to wait for confirmations is if it's a really really large amount and the person paying for it is not in front of you.  
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:32:33
Yes, that is what I was hinting at with my joke I thought I was making.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:12:04
Yea they could lower the fee since their buy/sell ratio is off a lot. I agree. That's why I am thinking of sending the appropriate papers to campbx and seeing how well they work. 
Coinbase is a good way to get into bitcoin fast. It's like a Fisher price My First Bitcoin Marketplace. If they don't want to grow up with their customers then the customers need to go find where the cool teenagers are hanging.

Yeah it's not like Nintendo ever did that, or Sony, or Microsoft.  They don't allow just any random joe company to make a game for their system so does that mean I don't own my console?

And hopefully by then the FDIC will cover bitcoin held by banks and if some hacker steals it then the FDIC will just pay you back.

If it's officially pro bono then the lawyer would have the launder the bitcoin into cash.  Or use it without the IRS knowing you're using it.

You can't stop someone from sending coins to an address. Therefore you can't stop a business from taking them, unless you can also force them to send the "bad" coins to the government so they can confiscate them.  Ok, now I'm even angrier about this CoINVALIDation shit.

You're a sad creature if you have to resort to personal attacks.  All my sympathies to those that have to interact with you on a daily basis.

You can sell on localbitcoins and never meet face to face. But you'd have to set up a bank account they could deposit to or take MoneyGram.

Town is .3 square miles and is practically in the middle of OKC and it still has its own police force. But this...


might be why.
I just learned about this not too long ago and I live here. (OKC, not Valley Brook)
edit: And I just read this on the wiki.  What a wonderful place.

They seem to conveniently choose to start the graph at about the same price as where it's currently (at time of ss) making people think that something big happened, it's over, nothing to see here.  Maybe, that's just how I would interpret that.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:56:04
Wow, the versatility of bitcoin... I've been meaning to get started with some soon once payday hits.  And all this week I watch the price go up and up and I can't do a thing about it.
@_date: 2013-10-24 07:22:29
Makes it all the more easier to headshot you my deary...

As long as the server is not in the US and is in a country that allows online gambling you should be golden.  If a gambling site only uses bitcoin then I would guess many countries wouldn't even care.  A site just can't take US players playing for US dollars.  It's easy to keep you from being able to use your $ the way you want.

Hell yes, Andre-as.  (meant to rhyme)
He's great to listen to at [letstalkbitcoin.com](  The best (and only?) talk show about Bitcoin and deserves more mention around here.  They even did a [New Users Episode] ( last Friday that is a great introduction to all the different aspects of Bitcoin from mining to securing your wallet.  
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:46:10
Definitely something that us living in the fast-paced technological world could use practice for.
@_date: 2013-05-13 12:09:06
The government can't just freeze a bitcoin account. What you said makes absolutely no sense given how bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:40:23
Coinbase is not an exchange. Sounds like you want an exchange. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:06:55
It was chosen specifically for the cringey innuendo. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:10:25
[They did on localbitcoins!]( yesterday.  I want to know who that sucker was...
@_date: 2013-12-16 05:38:18
Yea and a user shouldn't just be enabling things they don't understand. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:25:17
It's amazing to see Matt's transformation into such a strong advocate for Bitcoin.  I must admit when I first saw him mention the "12 Days of Bitcoin" he seemed a bit apathetic about it and didn't seem to care to even come close to learning the creator(s)' name and that made him look like all the other hosts.  Today, though, there's a bit of brightness and excitement in his face when he talks about Bitcoin that really sets him apart from the others.  I could see his frustration with the others in his face and it's just nice to actually see what my face probably looks like all the time when I watch these kinds of clips.

~~And now Havelock is down.  WTF?~~
I guess that was just for a minute.

That's why you give someone an amount that can be used right then to purchase something.  It's basically a gift card that a person can either gamble that the value of will go up in the future, but if they don't like that option, they can spend it right away.  It's more real than a gift card and you don't see people complaining that it's monopoly money.
