That’s AppleScript code (very old I think, had to work with it on a project, pain in the ass.) if’s fetching the price through JSON and “telling” to set it lol.
The problem with AppleScript is that it tries way to hard to be easy to use, making it a pain in the ass for anyone that actually knows programming/scripting.

Sort of yeah, most def not fun to use. Would’ve been better if they just used a standard.

Aahhh AirPods have become so extremely populair now, I used to be the only one having them, and now I see them literally everywhere. Not even suprised though, they take wireless to a whole different level.

That’s a bold claim, got a source to back that up?
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:56:17
No problem, I’m sorry for calling you that!
I’m glad we can end on a positive note :)

Yes! I’m glad they fit my ears! Feels like the perfect format, a nice balance between sound, portability, battery life and comfort. :)

“Apples OS” (actually iOS) is more secure than Android and surely more secure than Blackberry’s OS (Blackberry actually uses Android recently and their old OS is not maintained anymore).
Bring the downvotes if you want, these are facts.
It’s because of the way they manage the AppStore. This is a huge advantage of a closed system. A disadvantage is that you have less customizability, which android is better at, but security is 100% a win for iOS.

Well that settles it then, you’ve kind of proven that you’re just an ignorant kid that is not capable of having a grown up, fact based, argument backed discussion.
Yelling things without backing them up does not make your points valid, nor does it make you sound credible. 
Thanks and have a nice day :D

Well thanks for reading them, if you have some good sources on your points, let me know. 
Also, are you invested in Amazon, Apple or Alphabet? Because while I don’t want to tell you what to do, I think it’d be a good idea to reinvest some of that Blackberry money into one of these companies, I don’t see blackberry doing that great in the future (could be wrong of course). 
If you just really like the company then that’s ok, just sharing my opinion.

You may feel I’m dead wrong, but I’m not. It’s just the way the platform is built and controlled. Android is way more open, which is great too, but introduces a lot more security risk. 
This is a known fact, you can have your personal opinion on this, but that doesn’t mean you’re right. No system is 100% safe of course, and surely iOS is hackable too, but not as easily as Android simply because of it’s closed and walled garden approach.

I do know security, I actually know a lot about it and am quite active in the field. Go to any security conference and see which devices are most commonly used. 
And you’re wrong about blackberry, yes, the government used to be mostly blackberry for security reasons but they’ve been switching to iOS the last couple of years.
Donald Trump used an Android phone before and when he was elected, and then shortly after becoming president he was forced to switch to an iPhone for the sole reason of security. 
I don’t know if it’s ignorance or just plain hate for Apple, but respectfully, you’re wrong. I can understand your dislike for Apple, a lot of people dislike them, but don’t spread false information.

Yes, it's best to take out the emotion, same goes for stocks too (even though you can day-trade them if you go full-time, bitcoin is just better to keep holding)

This. When I started out, I was constantly checking, takes away so much productivity. Now I just check from time to time, knowing that even when it drops hard, It'll climb back up higher again. No need to check it, just live life and make money in the meantime. 
I've also recommended Bitcoin to some friends and warned them about not getting obsessed over it, at first they do get obsessed but then once they go through the shitcoin phase where they'll buy a bunch of shitcoins thinking it's the next bitcoin and lose some money, they eventually come to their senses lol.

Yes, when I saw it in the feed it was going forward, then when I clicked the post it was going backwards ��
