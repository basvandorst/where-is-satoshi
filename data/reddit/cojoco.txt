It looks like somebody is putting it to a test:
@_date: 2014-08-13 06:10:44
Not dead yet!
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:20:00
It's removed.
Poster is banned.
@_date: 2014-08-12 22:55:04
But not I wonder why that is?
@_date: 2014-08-13 06:11:30
I guess that *is* in their club.

You are never able to permanently over-ride an approved comment.
If the user edits their comment, that comment is resubmitted to the spam filter, and may be removed again.

We will remove any outright invitations to brigade, but exists solely for purposes of fun and pleasure, not as a source for brigades.
If you see brigading, please message the admins, and they will deal with it.
We can't see who is voting in bitcoin threads, we can't do a thing about it.

A better sub might be @_date: 2015-04-08 03:31:12
Oh, give it a rest.

Please calm down, and read what I am saying.
In most of my subs, racism, sexism, trolling and witch-hunts are banned.
and are special, because the posting rules disallow removals except for material which is against the rules of reddit.  I agree that this is not an ideal moderation strategy, but it's an interesting one, and it demonstrates the good and the bad of unalloyed free speech.


Oh ... maybe it was some obvious troll.  Your outrage is beginning to sound a little hollow.


Not really ... this is reddit.  I've been threatened with death and rape, and I treated the threats with about as much seriousness as was warranted, given the context.


This is all starting to sound a little woolley and unlikely.  Usually we ban for death threats.
I'm liking your new angry persona ... it makes a change from fake sincerity.

Hmmmm ... that's actually a complete misrepresentation of my position.
I enjoy uncensored subs like undelete and worldpolitics because they demonstrate both the good and the bad of unalloyed free speech, but no way would I advocate that moderation style as a model for reddit.
Most of my subs do ban and delete racists and racist speech.
This makes me a bit sad, actually ... we've been talking for a long time, and it appears that you don't have a clue about my position on this issue.


I doubt it ... death threats warrant a ban.


Pretty sure you're lying.


Sure you did.


No need for that sort of language!
@_date: 2015-04-08 01:49:11


My interests align with various communities on reddit, but that does not mean that I am necessarily aligned to the communities themselves.  In general, the undelete community hates me ... where does that leave me?


Sure, but not the desired consequences.


Bullshit.  I hung out around SRS and antiSRS long enough to discover that this is not the way the world works, at all.


RESPECT MA AUTHORITY!


Sure, for minor stuff.  Changes to the big stuff requires a little more.

I remember when undelete became a really active sub with lots of people commenting.
