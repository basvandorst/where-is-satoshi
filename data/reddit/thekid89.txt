Is the USB totally melted? Is there any chance of recovering that?

Yes this part is confusing to me as well. There isn't that much power going to the SSD, it must have shorted out bad without the PSU cutting off. If it was a GPU using shitty risers than this would make more sense. Seems like insanely bad luck

I think the barrier to entry also involves the complexity of having to write down or copy and paste a long complicated address. If you miss a letter or do it wrong you can potentially send lots of money to the wrong person. I believe Andreas when he says we are in the early internet days for bitcoin in that we use ip addresses instead of urls. We need to do the same with bitcoin and make bitcoin addresses much easier to work with.This will remove some key psychological barriers. I think some laypeople are turned off by having to deal with complicated addresses. Not sure how that could be done (if its even possible), but we should focus on making bitcoin more accessible and easier to use.

Shhhh. I thought comparing BTC to tulips was played out already
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:15:29
Yes, that is a big assumption however.

How are you determining the expected price?

Looks like he got a little over 4 BTC. Not shabby
