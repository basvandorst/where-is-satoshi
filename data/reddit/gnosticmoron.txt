That's why you rotate backups.

Pretty much the only places I see within several hours of here are places where you can obtain legal services or small luxury items.

Friends have encouraged me to adopt bitcoin, and seeing any kind of stability at all makes it seem like a more reasonable proposition.

If retirement is that far out, it's not unreasonable to devote a bit of your investment portfolio in volatile currencies. If so, dollar-cost averaging can mitigate some of the discomfort associated with the volatility.

I enjoyed it, the format in particular. (There are already "interview the expert" options available.)
If you employ the time honored practice of retractions and corrections in subsequent episodes, it'll all sort out.

The odds are slim to none that you will profit from this, and it will cause wear &amp; tear on your computer. So it would probably be an actual loss.

Buying one currency with another is often a pain. It was that way before bitcoin.

I don't see real danger in people grandstanding in a subreddit.
Let 'em have their fun.

I've got an Ubuntu machine with bitcoin core, and it's given me no trouble.

Post a brief video (that doesn't suck) showing how to do it, and maybe you can get a few to try it out. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:37:03
So what's your reason? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:23:44
I withheld this theory until I had collected enough knowledges. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:28:09
Heck yeah, all technology should be judged by watching people on reddit kill their time on reddit.
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:21:38
Sounds like one of the better reasons. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:12:43
I would say get into bitcoin if you have some way to spend it or want to be able to take payments. 
It's not really about community.

Is it just me, or is this just a pretty transparent ad for a gambling link?
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:42:13
Sorry for the shortened link. That's what I got when I clicked the option to share the playback location. 
It's episode 196, about 1 hour and 15 minutes in. The Coinbase app is entered into the weekly Android Arena contest. Winners are decided by popular vote.

He traded credibility for a modest marketing gimmick. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:26:38
I just wondered what your reason for buying in was.
I got into bitcoin when a business partner insisted I accept it as a payment option. I did so and have also acquired a modest amount of "cash on hand" bitcoin while testing how the process works.
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:58:27
So shady.

They hate us for our freedom. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:27:09
It may be helpful to think of it more as a currency than an investment. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:29:54
I'm not against people clumping together in virtual communities. I just think coming to a bitcoin subreddit because you're into bitcoin makes more sense than evaluating bitcoin by the subreddit. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:21:03
Yeah, I know you're right, and you know you're right. 
But almost everyone at my office would have a hard time with bitcoin. A couple of us use it, and they find it hilarious while going through a circus of computer problems day after day.
