Really no such thing as an educated guess with bitcoin, because of how volatile it is. This isnt like the stock market where you can make educated guesses and predict things.  Literally anything can happen with bitcoin. People can give opinions and guesses still yes, but its not an educated one due to what I said above.  The real success of bitcoin is dependent on it being adopted globally. It could never go below 8k again, it could drop to 3k again, no one knows. Dont try and guess or time it.

I personally have the ledger nano,  all I can really say is the security of it is great and it works.

Best option is to just invest and hold. Its too easy to lose money day trading/timing the market at this stage of bitcoin. You have fees for buying and selling.  You also dont know what its going to to. It could go down to 9k and you buy, expecting itll go 10.5k the next day like it just did over the weekend, but guess what? Nothing is stopping it from going to 4k either.  You might end up buying that 9k dip and then it crashes to 4k for 6 months.  You just dont know. Its very easy to lose money.

If you are decently invested in bitcoin, yes of course. You need to consider this, bitcoin is your responsbility, its different compared to traditional banks and other ways you store value where they do everything for you and your funds are backed. If you lose your keyfor bitcoin, its gone. If someone gets your keys, your bitcoin is gone. Keeping your bitcoin on an exchange is also bad due to hackers. Of course its very unlikely these exchanges will be hacked, but if so and they get access to accounts, your bitcoin is gone.  This is what makes a legdar great. Your bitcoin is stored off a computer, off 3rd party sites [etc.It]( also has the security such as 24 phrase word+pin+password. Buy bitcoin, transfer it to your ledger. Dont risk losing $2k(just an example) when you could have protected it for $60.
