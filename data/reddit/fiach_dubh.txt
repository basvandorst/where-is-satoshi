STOP THE PRESSES WE FOUND THE FLAW - It Was Me All Along :o
Ok so I was entering the seed, but then I just pressed the continue button afterwards WITHOUT submitting my password. this then just brought up the endless loading screen. 
So the fix: return an error when no password is entered afterwards in red so a user knows to enter their password AND/OR make it more noticeable that i need to enter my password to confirm the seed. (to be honest I wasnt paying attention, and was just hitting enter).
Damn, sorry for the headache, my bad.

so if such an event were to occur, what next? it be hard for bitcoin to survive, definite bear market like we've never seen before. Bitcoin would either have to evolve and enact modifications to the code to counteract such an attack (which would be difficult because consensus and such). OR another coin might beat it to market claiming to have already solved this "hack". Likely, an alternative cryto would rise to prominence. And if chinacoin actually solves this "hack" with its own coded solution and gets the open source go ahead, it could  legitimately replace bitcoin if it still holds true to the principles of bitcoin (which would be a mind fuck, but strategically a masterpiece of gamesmanship).

can't wait to play around some more with your platform. BTW, there was a short burst of the UI that i could see for one millisecond before it took me to the page to enter the seed confirmation. not a big issue, but it's got me excited to see what you guys have cooked in that lab of yours.

looks interesting.

that's why i just bought.
But its possible they won't be buying BTC to compensate totally hacked holdings. they may just give accounts the 64% in other peoples LTC, or ETH, or even cash?
This would be the easier option to, since going out buying/selling assets to get the right kind of original assets costs money. 
It will be very interesting to see how they implement this.

the private key is in the format of a 13 word seed. the seed words are scrambled to look like a somewhat strange poem and are engraved on the reverse. Someone would need to know that the poem is a seed, and to find out the correct words and the correct order of words.
All of these things she'll also have to figure out and there are clues. But the obscurity of the puzzle should leave her funds relatively secure.

On the God Stuff:
I grew up in a christian home raised to be a christian. I found the light one day in church when I realized that the preacher was a bully enacting guilt and shame from the pulpit to control the minds of weak men/donors. 
With that said, religion taught me some valuable lessons about propaganda, delusion, hope, story telling, symbols and power. and so Religion has a value of a sort.
So do I still believe in God? I do in a way, just not the version fed to me by other humans seeking to control me by being gods proxy. So let me just say that I'm open to the possibility of God, and I appreciate the history and heritage of Christianity.
My niece will be raised by her religious parents to be a christian. And hopefully, the ark will allow these gifts to pass under their radar without scorn.

I'm just saying you could potentially cut corners by compensating everyone with all asset classes split evenly/proportionally from a large basket. it would make things real simple for bitfinex to implement that kind of solution. but it would ne shitty for the user, cause who wants ETH.

This happened in ancient rome to an extent:






Naturally, at each stage of devaluation, people in the know would start to horde older coins and trade in new coins for old coins. Once the suckers of larger society caught onto this scheme they stopped trading their old coins for newer ones and started hording these older coins as well. But now the race was on to buy physical assets with these new coins before prices would naturally rise for these items because of the inherent inflation caused by this devaluation of the currency and inflation of the monetary base.

this. such an attack would be met with community outrage. people would start mining at a loss, just to say fuck china. old gpu miners would come out of the closet. hell id start mining on my laptop just because. 
mining power has to significantly outpace the dorment old mining power for this chinacoin method to be devastating.
But if they really wanted to do some strategic damage, they could stalk pile their own miners (say 100% of the current hashrate). turn them on just before a difficulty adjustment, so now the difficulty is 200% of what it was. Then turn them off and direct them at the new chinacoin. 
that would be difficult for dormant backup miners to fight against.
the weird thing is, the game theory checks out, making this scenario a mathematical probability the further along we go towards the event horizon of fiat=toiletpaper and Bitcoin=money.

good question. know one knows for sure. there's an argument to be made that there will be a flood into Bitcoin since it is inherently scarce. Libra won't be scarce, it will be stable, abundant and permissoned.

to be honest, I don't see that happening since it would require a hardfork because:
 
a) the issue would become politicized most likely
b) and for technical reasons, a hardfork would likely be needed to implement onchain privacy features.
there would also be more bloat as a result of implementing privacy features, which could make the scaling issue more relevant again.
For now, I see lightning as bitcoin's privacy solution in the long term since it can serve as a mixer, payments solution, and more.

no of those things would kill bitcoin inside America. Yes it would discourage public ownership, but it would force this new technology into the underground. which may have more unintended consequences then if it were to remain is this grey area. its hard to make something you can memorize criminal in terms of enforcement. For example with golds ban in the 30's, at least you could seize physical safety deposit boxes that held gold. but that's not the case with bitcoin. meanwhile, the rest of the world would be open to this tech.

its either a clever mutual fund or clever ETF. They are taking money in exchange for their tokens and using that money to buy assets to "back" their token.

The Hillary's Emails meme was one of the core arguments of the Trump campaign, implying you can't trust this person. Without wikileaks, those emails would not be available. Without Bitcoin supplying 20 million in funding to wikileaks, there would be no email support. The election was won by a slim margin. Hillary got more votes, but Trump still won. No sir, I vehemently disagree. Bitcoin has already, though inadvertently, had an unseen impact on American culture and politics. Not just politics, but the outcome of a presidential election. If that's not powerful, I don't know what else is.

If anyone knows kleiman's true involvement it's probably his co-adopted brother, ira.
Ira was apparently the one who has david klieman's effects ie potential hard drives with millions of bitcoins on them.
If David was indeed satoshi or some how involved with satoshi, I believe he would have had the foresight to give ira detailed instructions or what if scenario's for release of information related to the identity of satoshi and management of coins.

I'm going to hijack this comment to point something out. Wikileaks would have had a very very hard time without Bitcoin when paypal, mastercard and visa cut them off from donators in 2010. They may have even folded, or not been around to receive the leaks from the DNC/Hillary Emails debacle. This arguably was a big piece in throwing shade on Hillary's entire campaign, and led to mass doubt.
So what I'm saying is, **Bitcoin led to the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the presidential election of 2016**
Edit: forgot to add, because of the embargo on wikileaks, they received more funds in the long term due to the exponential rise of the Bitcoin since **DECEMBER OF 2010**.
Edit2: I never realized that wikileaks had control of sum 3000 Bitcoin at one time \(around 20 million USD today\).](
Edit3: Stranger still is that **Satoshi Was Wrong** *(GASP)* about Wikileaks receiving only pocket change.

and yet the more centralized, small and large will thrive off this strategy, taking away market share for the ones who play by the rules. It's not a killer competitive advantage, but it is a competitive advantage none the less. The value of Bitcoin is irrelevant as long as it is supported by the pools who don't turn evil. The irony of this situation is that by staying good, you are enabling the bad actors of the ecosystem. Pyramid like. This phenomenon will have negligible impact on the BTC price, thus incentivizing its use for bad actors.

cool, I really hope someone will come up with a tracking metric for this. Kinda similar to bitcoin days destroyed I imagine.
But maybe we can call this bitcoin days locked, which will measure on any given day how many bitcoins are currently locked for 24 hrs, then 3 days, 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, 5 years, etc.
edit: oops, i didnt read carefully enough. so it looks like we wont be tracking this since we can't know until locked coins are spent :(

@_date: 2015-06-07 17:56:12
I'd be very careful moving forward, everyone is going to want a piece of your pie. try to keep this information to yourself.
first step is securing your BTC. you may want to look into getting a trezor before recovering your BTC. Also multi-signature combined with trezor is a good way to secure your funds. But it's also a good way to loose your funds if you don't know what you are doing.
for something straight forward and simple and secure, stick to trezor only.
After you have confirmed and secured your BTC on your own you can move forward with selling some.
If you want to sell all of them at once then I'd go the legit wrought and consult a tax lawyer before doing so. 
But another option could be to sell them/convert them to hard assets slowly over time. using local BTC atm's to withdraw anonymously, buying gold/silver etc. this a more shady path though.
also, trust no one. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 01:53:02

@_date: 2015-12-30 10:23:24
interesting. i suppose its still useful to measure such occurances, but not as interesting as those currently locked. unlessssss maybe the website admins enable some kind of tracking button that can be checked off optionally to broadcast to the world that these coins are in fact locked.

@_date: 2015-12-06 18:03:39
I think I got a little carried away...
but the thing I wanted to convey with satoshi wasn't really the entombment. but more the similarities between the creation of the Blockchain as being comparable to that of the pyramids and the pharaohs who created them. 
Both are virtually indestructible, short of nuclear warfare, and should last for a really long time. 
So in that respect, the name of satoshi will live on inside the blockchain far after you I and everyone else is in the ground.
furthermore. I like to think of Bitcoin as similar to a pyramid in terms of it's security. imagine trying to move the bottom most block at the center of the pyramids of Giza. You can't unless you remove the vast majority of blocks above and around it. this would take months of man power, cranes etc. I like to think of the Genesis block having the same level of security.
So when people say bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, you can say no, it is a pyramid of security.

This is a picture of my niece flipping through  u/andreasma
Andreas M. Antonopoulos' [Mastering Bitcoin]( I had given this to my brother as a gift to look at, and he texted me the above pictures to my great joy (my niece loves books and is supper aware of new things that arn't hers). 
I wanted to give you all an update. Some of you may remember[ a post I made 2 years ago]( here about my soon to be born niece. I wanted to do something special for her, so I went ahead and gave her some gold silver and bitcoin along with a Noah's Ark piggy bank. See the above post for details.
At the time, the Bitcoin I gave her and the gold and silver combined were worth exactly the same amount. 271 Canadian dollars for 1/10th an ounce of gold and 1 and a half ounces of silver. The equivalent of this was 0.34346 Bitcoin at the time (pre BCH fork).
A number of generous donators also contributed to her college fund. To them, I want to say thank you on her behalf...it seems that one day your generous contributions will pay off her college if things continue as they are...
The [0.23 BTC in donations this subreddit (for a total of 0.57 BTC)]( gave to my niece  have sat through thick and thin, not moving even for all the hardforks. And they will sit there until she discovers the key to her vault of now multiple coins, or she turns 18 and needs to pay for university. I'd like to think Satoshi would be proud.
Within 2 years those Bitcoin are now worth enough money to pay for an entire semester of University (around 5500 Canadian). And that's not including forked coins. I hope and pray that one day it will grow to pay for her entire education. 
Happy Birthday little panther, here's to the next generation of cypherpunks.

mentioned that double taxation of bitcoin

if the digital 
currency is treated as a commodity and thus subject to capital gains taxes, and is then treated as a 
currency 
for purposes 
of the Goods and Services Tax. 
Andreas Antonopoulos
said that taxation of 
bitcoin should be based on the digital currency
use; it would be subject to capital gains tax if held 
as an investment and to sales tax when used as a currency. In his opinion, 
it would be beneficial to 
tax issues

Hi alcinolegumes
My recommendation is to get a hardware wallet, like a trezor or a ledger nano (or both for redundancy) to store the majority of your crypto wealth. Both of these wallets are very secure, though trezor has open sourced more of its code then ledger has, which arguably makes it more trust worthy for some. but to be honest, both are just fine.
with that said, still play around with mobile and desktop wallets to get a better sense of how all this works. it's a great learning experience.
1. both are vulnerable to be honest. these devices are often used with other applications so the attack surface is wider. which is why a hardware wallet is preferable for long term storage of large amounts, it's attack surface is minimal. however, a very safe setup for a desktop wallet would be to fresh install linux and only install bitcoin core on the computer and use it for nothing else.
2. I prefer electrum, mycelium is fine too, but electrum has been around longer and allows you to select a trusted node.
3. electrum can be safe enough if you use it correctly. For instance, by using the[ tails operating system]( to first set up a wallet with electrum on a OS that completely wipes itself after shutting down. basically this means you get a free wallet  seed that is generated fairly securely. this seed can then be used to restore the wallet in the future if stored correctly. However, you will not have immediate access to your funds, as you will need to restore the wallet from the seed, and this can take ten or twenty minutes depending on the situation.
6. paper wallets are safer in terms of being safe from hackers. but they are much more vulnerable to the physical world, fire and water damage or being lost, or decomposing then a hacker.  paper wallets are very vulnerable to long term storage if it's not done properly. but in my opinion a paper wallet is fine as long as you have also memorized the seed/private key and continue to repeat it to yourself every day before going to bed. (this is also recommended for regular seeds)
7. yes they are meant for one time only transactions. restoring a paper wallet/seed can make that seed/paper wallet vulnerable to exposure.
8. the key when restored is not compromised, but more vulnerable, so its not recommended for reuse. never use a online app or device to store a seed or paper wallet private key.  
you should also be thinking in terms of being safe from not just hackers but the physical world when storing a seed. you can lose your seed in a fire, you can forget your seed if you memorize it, you can have your seed stolen if it's not well stored/obvious/stored along with other valuables that are stolen in conjunction with a theft, your back up device may decompose or stop working.
all these factors point to one thing. you need redundant back ups. not just one. but at the least two copies of the seed, stored securely, in a non decomposing fashion, invulnerable as possible.
its a great challenge, and can be fun too.

It'll make things interesting in the future when you can track every transaction, especially the ones that are known to be illegal/theft associated. This will insentivize users to build laundering services, which I believe already exist. But if those services also get stone walled/sanctioned by the community it could be possible to discontinue dirty bitcoins. And like lost wallets, that's less of the 22 million to go around. BUT say we quarantine these dirty bitcoin's, have them blacklisted by EVERYONE. Then you could theoretically negotiate with the thief to return the dirty bitcoins to the owner for a finders fee. the amazing thing is, the technology is there to make this possible. the game theory is fascinating. Which is why this could be a chink in the armor of BTC. Once things start going legit, the momentum will be taken out of the bull. One of the driving forces behind BTC is its corruptibility. As soon as the technology allows the market to self regulate its corruption that will take a chunk out of the market. The hope is by then the market will not rely so much on the corrupt elements and be big enough based on legitimate transactions.

my concern is that this script allows for the DDOSing of the network as it currently stands. It takes an army of anons to do this, but it's possible with bad actor trolls like 4chan.
The longer the attack, the greater the impact, but imagine having a week of 4hour confirmation times...could be an interesting event since they could conceivably hold the network hostage. They could cash out when offered a bounty, or by hedging BTC with NBT or cash and converting the price takes a significant enough hit to buy in after the dust settles, or do both.

Government regulation will have an interesting effect on Bitcoin based businesses and exchanges. The worse the the regulation in terms of taxes and exclusions the more incentive there is for businesses to move to more favorable jurisdictions. This has already happened with at least one online bitcoin poker site whose owner and family was harassed by police. He latter, smartly, packed up and moved his family to base his operations out of an island country. They recently issued a warrant for his arrest in the US, so he can basically never go home.
This is the interesting thing about bitcoin, it enables the shades of grey that are on the fringes to come into being more predominantly. It will have the effect of really challenging the wisdom in some very draconian laws still in effect today, that could be equated to prohibition in the 30's.
Bitcoin allows these grey areas to grow into the light, it claims them from the dark influence. maybe too metaphorical, but that's how I talk.
So with that said, regulation is arbitrary and will have a hard time of physically moving a digital asset that is virtually immovable without the consent of the 51. 
Bitcoin's response to Regulation will be like that of king Theoden to Gandalf the White at his intervention, "hehAHcHACHAHAH, You Have NO Power Here Gandalf The Grey"
...hopefully we don't find out that Government is actually a white wizard...
more metaphors, guh

My interpretation of recent, past events as it relates to the significance of Chinese Exchanges in the Bitcoin Space:
Since time immortal the, Chinese Dragon has reigned supreme with it's cloud of smoke. But this smoke was a veil to impress his friends with its strength (ie significantly manipulated trading volume). 
Whenever the dragon flicked it's tail from one direction to the next, his friends The Strong Bull (Bitfinex), Burly Bear (BTC-E) and Busy Beaver (QuadrigaCX) would cower in submission.
"HOLLY MOLLY, Dragon friend looks huge, we better get out of the way!" Said the Bull. Naturally the Dragon became haughty and vein at his supposed power over the BlockChain Winds, thinking himself the Emperor of all Animals, as they scurried from his tail.
But we all know the archetypal story behind Pride, it invariably involves a fall. And so one day the God of Rain (PBOC Up in the ShiZzLE) seeing the hubris of the dragon decided to douse the Dragons flame from which he conjured his smoke. 
"MIGHTY DRAGON, YOU HAVE REIGNED BY SMOKE FOR TOO LONG, SEE I HAVE REVEALED YOUR TRUE STRENGTH, YOUR FIRE IS GONE, YOUR SMOKE CLEARS, LOOK ON ANIMAL FRIENDS, FOR YOUR EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES."
And so the friendly beasts came out of hiding to see that their Dragon Emperor was as large as each of them, for they stood at the same height. (Except the Beaver, but he's a relative of the honey badger, so no fucks given)
The Dragon, once more trying to assert it's dominance of which he was so used to, flicked his tail at his friends. He Expected them to flee in terror! (the recent, but not so significant "dump").
But instead of scouring and hiding, the Bull jumped over the Dragons tail and onto the Dragons back. The Beaver followed the Bull and scurried up the Dragons side. The Dragon Froze in Fear of what was happening, for he thought that his friends meant to harm him for his hubris. 
Finally the Bear also climbed aboard the Dragons back. All three smiled down on the Dragon, still frozen in fear, as he looked up at them waiting for their revenge (OH GOD THEY'RE GOING TO DUMP ON ME). 
But just then, a fiery Ball in the night sky shot over their heads. "What's that!" said the Beaver. The Bear answered, "Why I do believe it's an Extra Terrestrial Fire." 
"After it!" Said the Bull. Having forgotten everything in the excitement, The Dragon instinctively Kicked off a flew after the Extra Terrestrial Fire. "Where is it going?" asked the Bull, whose eyes weren't so good at night.    
The Dragon with 21/21 vision answered the Bull, "Too the Moon!"

my two cents: PBOC is trying to modernize the regulation of bitcoin exchanges in China responsibly, without malicious intent.
Evidence: they could have called a meeting last month, required trading fees to be added AND halted all withdrawals to upgrade KYC/AML.
BUT they didn't. My belief is they recognize that the exchanges are fragile and are therefore introducing gradual upgrades, so as not to spook customers away from the space.
They can and could bring out the hammer on this space in China, but that's not what this is. It's bringing out some wrenches and screws for installation of a regulatory compliance mechanism. I'm going to be buying this dip modestly.

So if I'm to understand this correctly, hot wallets were being automatically replenished with funds from cold wallets due to some hack.

in my experiance, people don't move unless they NEED to move. unless there is a real crisis caused by lack of scaling such as a transaction backlog, causing the price to collapse, or a competitor implementing a better scaling solution, causing the price to crash, then we are kind of in limbo. 
basically its going to take the price to crash and users to throw up there hands in frustration and leaving for greener pastures before something happens with scaling. that's at least for the current scaling solutions, ie BU and segwit. all indications point to neither of these happening as they currently stand.
 so its going to take a crisis for one of these to prevail OR a third option solution that hasn't been invented yet, ie lightning without segwit. so the question then becomes, will Bitcoin face a crisis of faith first in order to drive a scaling solution, or will a magical third party scaling solution arrive before a crisis. place your bets.

i use linux mint, its very usable/friendly. I actually do use linuxmint as a form of hardware wallet for a staking cryptocurrency that doesn't have hardware wallet support.
so as long as you verify the OS as valid, and verify the bitcoin wallet as valid with the provided signatures, you should be fine if the bitcoin wallet you use is the only thing you install on the OS. but its not ideal for long term use for large amounts of funds.
consider a hardware wallet in the long term.

timing the market can be a factor some of the time as it does take a day or two for a purse order to be filled some of the time. but the risk is minimal when your looking at a 33% spread. so the price of bitcoin would have to move 33% within two days for your trade to be underwater. I know your just trolling and fuding, but hey maybe you'll give it a shot, or someone else might.

blame amazon for locking their gift cards inside their ecosystem. and its more like 67-85%
the discount can vary depending on how soon you want your order filled. so maybe 15% to have your order filled within the same hour of your order. This also invalidates any currency variance risk/swing in price that your were concerned about previously.

you could either make 100 different transactions to 100 different addresses that are still your own or do some kind of special multi-transaction-output transaction that sends 100 coins to 100 different addresses within one transaction. this is probably the best/most efficient way of doing it, but i have not tried it before. it provides a small amount of obscurity, but for anyone really digging they'll be able to see what's going on and perhaps conclude that all 100 addresses are yours.

so what happens for depositing CAD?
Is it converted to USD? Or is there CAD/BTC exchange?
EDIT: Full press release below from their Blog: 










    Buy ETH with USD or BTC, and sell ETH for USD or BTC






So what i can glean from this is that you have to deposit USD to trade on the exchange...meaning i have to convert from CAD to USD...which costs money to do.
This is only useful for Canadians who already have USD in USD accounts...which isn't exactly for us little guys. 
I guess they're going after big Canadian fish with this. Looks like QuadrigaCX is safe for now.
On the other hand, this may open up an opportunity for canadians to get USD by selling long held BTC or ETH, so not a bad option from that perspective. However, QuadrigaCX also already has a USD/BTC exchange available on their platform for Canadians...so this isn't really anything new in the ecosystem, except maybe for an exchange with more volume.

My 2 satoshis. I agree, the impact of this event is probably overstated. I'm more interested in the ideas that underpin this event, mainly the importance of self-custody. The issue with a continual campaign is that it's much harder to sustain with the same level of energy, and to be honest this thread is that subtle continual campaign in a way. I mean every day we could make this same thread, "not your keys, not your bitcoin". But people get tired of hearing that I think. A one day event focuses the energy. And the idea of making the exchanges shudder a little is empowering to a degree, even if it is delusional.
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:53:09
the more addresses the better in my opinion. down the road if you were to spend those coins from just one address, the person who received payment for a good you purchased would be able to lookup exactly how much BTC you have. but if your holdings are spread over multiple addresses, this isn't the case. the only cost will be network transaction fees for each address. but if you were already going to make the same number of withdrawals it doesn't matter. therefore, the more addresses the better as long as you were already planning on making the same number of withdrawal transactions.

you may want to look into Tails OS.
it has a bitcoin wallet, electrum, built into it.
so you can generate a seed, right it down/memorize it and do your transactions while booted with Tails.
But Tails wipes itself when you shutdown your computer automatically. so there goes your wallet. you'd need to restore your wallet with the seed each time you boot up in tails, which is a security risk.

Opendime, though these are not ideal for long term storage as there is no backup mechanism unless they are unsealed
@_date: 2019-11-02 01:08:14
oh ok, i guess that makes sense. id test it out with a small amount first, just in case it resets itself after the first boot.
ideally you'll also want a paper backup of your seed too in case your usb dies. ideally you should memorize your seed in case both device and paper backup get lost in a fire.
verifying the OS AND wasabii wallet signatures is absolutely vital though, to make sure you know what you downloaded is the legitimate installation/program.
remember, you're still trusting the wallet program/OS here, and the hardware/computer you are using.
encrypting the usb may make it unbootable though, but there might be something fancy out there that can do that too.
my advice, use both your setup and the ledger nano s. learning how both can work is very important for your knowledge/learning.
@_date: 2019-11-28 04:44:37
yep. you should try it before discounting it. the idea is to buy bitcoin, setup a purse.io order as soon as possible, preferably at the top of a market cycle. get a 33% discount, which is basically a 33% markup on your bitcoin price (so no i dont care about fees). as long as bitcoin remains 33% above where you purchased it at, you are in the clear value wise. 
as for the next year angle, doesn't matter. you've taken value possession of the amazon object by then, so its irrelevant. this only really work if you were already going to make a purchase on amazon for something.
its also not purse.io giving out the discount themselves. purse is just a marketplace for other users to cash in their amazon gift cards for bitcoin by buying amazon products for other people in exchange for their bitcoin.
you should try it for black friday as an experiment.

I believe two exchanges went under around the same time last year. QuadrigaCX being one of the bigger ones. The founder of that exchange conveniently died while vacationing in India at the exact moment his ponzi scheme was running out of funds to satisfy depositors.  
I view this event as a coordinated community driven liquidity squeeze to see who is wearing no clothing when the tide goes back out. 
It also has the added benefit, in theory, of incentivizing exchanges to purchase BTC if they themselves do not have enough in reserve to satisfy depositors, thus improving the price.
It also teaches the noobies the importance of self-custody for Bitcoin, a topic I plan to write on in depth soon. Self-custody is way more important for Bitcoin then any other asset class in history, the implications are more vast then people realize.

you can. is it a good idea from a security perspective. debatable.
there are two risk factors you need to consider. theft and user error.
by memorizing your seed you negate the theft aspect which is great. but you open yourself up to user error through
 a) memorizing the wrong seed words
 b) writing down the wrong public receive address that correspond with your seed
 b) forgetting over time
 c) your funds are now vulnerable to sudden concussions, death.
Furthermore, using electrum as your primary wallet through tails can be a bit of a hassle in terms of user experience if you need to transfer funds quickly. If it means you have to recover your wallet each time by typing in the seed, then the theft attack vector is opened up again (never type in your seed with a usb connected keyboard). 
as for electrum going bust, your seed should still be supported by other wallets. 
In  any case you should experiment with a small amount of funds to see if this method is feasible for your purposes.

you need to do some more research before stepping into the darkweb with crypto.
shakepay is a custodial wallet. ie they hold the bitcoin for you. electrum is not a custodial wallet, ie you are responsible for the bitcoin keys when using electrum. the keys are those 12 or 24 words first given to you when setting up your wallet. if you lose those words and your computer dies with the electrum wallet on it, you lose your bitcoin.
do more research. use furthermore, if you were to send bitcoin directly from your shakepay account to the darkweb for the purchase of illicit goods, shakepay would be able to piece that activity together. all transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are public, but pseudonymous.

someone had a lot of inputs lying around (think of this a change/coinage) and they consolidated a lot of this change into a smaller number of outputs (like converting change at a coinstar machine into high denomination bank notes).
when doing this on the bitcoin blockchain it takes some time for the machine/bitcoin blockchain to process/convert all this change into a smaller number of outputs/100 dollar banknotes. in this case, one weekend.
makes you wonder, in this case there was half a million inputs. how much time would it take for a coinstar machine to process a half million pieces of change?

ya you're wrong there. I buy bitcoin to get  33% off on my amazon purchases using purse.io
its a purely economic decision. why pay full price when i can buy bitcoin, and use that to buy stuff on amazon at a 33% discount. and no this isn't available with fiat, it's only doable with Bitcoin.
and if you think amazon is the only store that allows for Bitcoin to be used for purchases then you're dead wrong. look at coincards.com, I can buy giftcards for hundreds of stores with Bitcoin.
or bylls.com I can use that website to pay off my credit card bill, electric bill, even my college tuition with Bitcoin.
not good enough? how about apmex.com, or goldsilverbull.com or several other physical gold and silver coin websites that accept bitcoin directly for their inventory.
Bitcoin at the very least is a better medium of exchange then gold or silver, which is more than peter scheiff gives it credit for. You can't buy Bitcoin with gold or silver for instance, but you can buy gold and silver with Bitcoin.

Hi DmesticG
QuadrigaCX is good Canadian exchange to use for purchasing bitcoins. however you or your father may need to verify your identity to deposit funds. I've gone through the verification process with them, so I know they will need three things.
a digital copy of your drivers license/photo ID.
a picture of you holding that license/photo ID.
and a banking statement/Monthly Bill Statement with your name on it.
all of these things can be uploaded to their site. Once you have your account verified you can deposit funds through a variety of methods such as wire transfer or interac online.
Once you purchase the Bitcoins I suggest you transfer them off the exchange to a secure bitcoin hardware wallet such as a keepykey, ledger nano blue or Trezor.
If you have further questions I would be happy to talk to you further, feel free to message me.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:07:20

my guess is that its using you as a way to obscure itself.
These are probably stolen funds that are then being parsed out to known addresses of people that are publicly available.
This way your identity is tied to these funds along with hundreds of others as a scheme to obscure the real identity of the thief.
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:24:30


Exactly, its probably best to not move those coins you received. at the very least keep them separate from your other coins. at the very most, cash them out anonymously somehow.
EDIT: Also, check your receiving address that was used. google it, check out its previous history. is it view able publicly somehow? what was it used for previously? or is it brand new? that will give you some clues.

If you're interested in the electricity companies perspective on crypto mining there was a recent webinar I recorded on just that topic. Very interesting stuff for utility guys/engineers: 
What I took away from it is that Electricity utilities are kind of in a ass backwards mind set at trying to be revenue neutral. When they could be making a killing for their rate payers by charging crypto miners more for power then the average user (which is fair in my mind). This extra revenue could be used to offset the cost of power for normal rate payers. An even crazier idea would be for the utlity to opt into a revenue sharing agreement with miners, say 1% of crypto mined.
Furthermore, crypto mining is proving to be a great option for power generators who over estimated the demand for their product (power). Much of the time these guys need to shut down their plant, or sell their power at discounted rates to a different territory. A novel idea is to just hook up cryptocurrency miners to these lost power generators.
interesting times.

The paper really helped to say what I've been thinking for a long while. This stood out for me, on why avoiding hardforks and even softforks are preferred, and that segwit is the compromise, and if that doesn't work out, great! Bitcoin still works for its primary purpose: store of value - backed by immutability.


immutability. Our compromise on change has been to allow soft forks. Our compromise on the
block size is SegWit. But eventually contention will block soft forks. And if that happens now,
then Great! As it turns out, we did not have to compromise at all (although the benefits of
SegWit are nice).

well these guys have a master of crytpocurrency, but they're based in cyprus and arn't ranked in the world university rankings...
information systems security courses, courses on cryptography are probably safe bets, so i think your current approach is the right one. if you gain enough baseline knowledge you may want to get certified for information security/ethical hacking ability. (there's a tonne of these kinds of certifications though and depends on your location). once you have that, you may want to consider a masters in information systems and security, or something related, but that's far down the road.
for now, getting a baseline for the introduction stuff is a good idea, but also get involved with your local bitcoin communities to see what the ground floor environment feels like. that will also help present some oppurtunities for learning more.

@_date: 2017-01-08 23:17:04
I'd say its both, but the primary one is the number guessing ability. Bitcoin is basically a distributed supercomputer specifically designed to guess a certain number as a fast as possible ie hashing. This ability to guess numbers really fast is also the reason behind why it is so secure. and from it's security, confidence is given to bitcoin. That confidence is it's value proposition.
Energy isn't the selling point, security through a very fast super computer that can guess numbers faster than anything in existence is. That's why people say it's backed by math.

I had a premonition of the potential for higher capacity spam attacks from previous explanations of segwit. Your comment kind of exacerbates these fears...So now I'm leaning against segwit if it means that current spam attacks could be made more effective/cheaper/damaging.
Would appreciate some more analysis from the community on this question. specifically, the cost of implementing current spam attacks, and their measured effect. the cost of implementing segwit type spam attacks and the measured effect. compare the two.
from this we can determine if we are trading a gun for a buzzuka with segwit.

there are some exchanges that have very light KYC regulations that allow you to trade bitcoin without verifying your ID up front. I think Kraken and Binance are two good options if this is a concern. There also always bitcoin ATM's that usually dont need your drivers license unless you are buying a huge amount of Bitcoin, but they often charge a higher rate per bitcoin/satoshis.

Like I said previously, the wallet addresses have recieved 169k of Bitcoin over the course of their lifetime. The current balance of these wallets is 0. It's hard to tell what the total maximum amount in these wallets was at any given time as you can send 1 Bitcoin to the same address and back to the second address 169k times for the same result. I recommend you look at the adresses yourself.
@_date: 2019-08-15 03:19:38

Before you sell anything, see a professional accountant about the tax consequences so you know specifically how much you need to set aside to pay the tax man in your country.
At least pay off your debts, and set aside a years worth of living expenses for peace of mind.
Be sure to look into securing your leftover Bitcoin you decide to keep in a hardware wallet, or through a trusted custodian with insurance. I believe Gemini has insurance on the Bitcoin they hold in cold storage custody. 
some trusted hardware wallets include the Trezor and Ledger Nano.

the blockchain is psydononymous. so it uses strings of numbers and character to identify receiving and sending addresses. 
here's a simple transaction example that anyone can view of a bitcoin transaction on the blockchain: 
you and I can't tell who 
BUT. say if the first wallet is a coinbase wallet of a user, and the second wallet is a popular gambling website that is known to use this second address or related addresses: THEN coinbase knows that you sent bitcoin to a gambling website in theory, AND the gambling website likely knows that those funds came from coinbase.
hope that helps.

all you gotta do is earn amazon gift cards. there's tonnes of ways to do this, from surveys, mturk, perktv.

sure thing, it's just one factor to keep in mind. a second more popular trend has been people referring to Bitcoin's stock to flow ratio as a basis for valuation. This idea is a little more speculative, but highlights Bitcoin's value proposition through it's increasing scarcity over time.
Take a look at [this chart]( first and try and understand it for 10 minutes. Then when you've given up, read[ the article]( on this topic, its a good one.
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:05:25
it may be possible to eventually have some kind of pruned database of the bitcoin blockchain on a phone app that would update as it is connected to the internet. an opendime could then be used to verify that funds in the past have landed on a address in which that opendime claims to have. 
as long as the opendime is sealed, then those funds would be confirmed by that app as being on the opendime, even though there would be no internet available.
its just that the funds would need to be moved into that opendime, and you'd have a copy of that transaction within the phone app before the internet goes down.
there's also the blockstream satellite that could be used to update your node to receive bitcoin blocks from space.
so as long as there is internet somewhere, and so long as the internet comes back to your region one day, an opendime could be used as a temporary cash like medium of exchange without the internet, provided that you can use that phone app to verify the opendime has had funds deposited to the address it owns.

truth be told, institutional education is a bit of a joke for the price you're paying these days (especially in the states, fuck). you don't need it, everything is available online for free, but it can help with structuring your time and forcing you to learn something. 
with that said, a good way to hack the education system for it's useful content is to look at the courses you are interested in doing, and look at their course outlines for the textbooks and resources they use. look up those textbooks online using libgen and download them for free. if the class really looks tempting, take it at a part time/continuing education student/visiting student. (always keep the course outlines of every course you take by the way, these are the currency of higher education. They are necessary for receiving transfer credit).
Shop the fuck around when it comes to your education, it's a financial decision ultimatly. if you do a masters, make sure it has a thesis (there are some by coursework/no thesis that are worth shit).

One Computer could represent a megahash, a Server could represent a terahash, a super computer could be a petahash.
Furthermore, and this is the key part, the entire computing power of the world should also be an option to compare against the Bitcoin network automatically, so people can get a better idea of how big this number guessing game actually is.
In addition, a sum total of fiatleaking would be useful for the past 24hrs, 7 days, month, and year.

Not really. the idea behind hardware wallets is that you have a securely designed hardware environment that does one thing and one thing only. secure the keys and run specific firmware only to communicate securely with a Trezor wallet interface. that's it.
with electrum being sfotware, it runs on a device that likely has multiple programs running at the same time. and some of those programs could be malicious and, for example, change the receiving electrum address for the wallet to one of an attacker. This is a known virus that's in the wild currently.




basically if you feel like you have too much money in crypto on your phone or laptop, and it would hurt to lose that amount, get a hardware wallet for peace of mind, trezor or ledger. coldcard for advanced bitcoin only users

Ty for the info. I'm talking end of days kind of scenario, like an EMP hitting both sides of the earth with only shielded computers left standing kinda thing.
Furthermore, maybe I just want to do it for fun even though it'll never find a block, it's more about the psychological chance to. I feel like if people are given that opportunity back, many hobbyists would mine for the sake of it. It's also a cool way to demonstrate to your college class how mining was done back in the day.
If this feature were to be introduced back into the GUI client it should include a warning that users should not expect to succeed in mining at the current difficulty, and that the function is meant for hobbyists only. heck it should probably be hard to enable this feature in the first place, but I'd like the option.

he didn't rule it out either. For me, the real highlight was that his speech implied that the renminbi may one day become a world reserve currency, surpassing that of the Dollar, and that a compromise would be some kind of SHC to prevent friction in this transition. This was ludicrous to read for me.  All this implies that the dollar end game is not only on our minds, but on the minds of the people at the Bank of England. Either that, or they want a seat at the reserve currency table again, which is more likely.

no worries, I'm happy to answer your questions. 
yes, often bitcoin ATMs do not need to know your ID unless you are buying a large amount of Bitcoin. However, this can vary from bitcoin ATM to bitcoin ATM.
this website might help: 
exchange accounts are still something you may want to begin looking into, as they allow you to sell your bitcoin fast in the case of an emergency. However, having an exchange account is not necessary, it just means you don't have an instant sell option. 
if you buy bitcoin with an atm, store that bitcoin on a hardware wallet, then you'd need to go back to a bitcoin atm to sell it. which is not ideal because of the fees and the hastle of going to somewhere physical, which can take time.
check out binance or kraken for good exchanges.

true, there are those two elements and it could go either way really. but the third main element I'm getting at is the accountability, openness/transparency aspect of this game. 
you'd be able to demonstrate: a) the funds are available
b) the funds have been set aside
c) the funds are not moving until one year form now when the game is over
d) the funds are transferred to the winner at the time of game resolution. so we're not only playing a game, but also demonstrating the usefulness of bitcoin to play such games.

only if that widget is not reproducible, ie it's scarce and there can only ever be 21 million of them. you also produce the full supply of 21 million widgets by 2140, when you create the last widget. these widgets can also be transferred over the internet instantly and settle within the hour.

when you did update your firmware did you check the checksum on the device to see if it matched the one on the screen? it should have looked like a short string of numbers and letters, and the ones on your screen and the device should have matched. do you remember if this happened during your update? and if it did, do you remember if they matched?

correct. and 97% of the sha256 hashrate has decided to go with Bitcoin (BTC)
in a way it's a self fulfilling prophecy as miners will mine on a chain that they believe the majority of other miners will also mine on for the long term, as that chain would likely be more valuable then other ones.
it's less of an ideological decision then a economic one.

Here's all the things that are giving me a subtle feeling lately. 
*  FED is buying back Treasuries AGAIN to the Tune of $60 Billion per month until the second quarter of 2020...which basically means until forever.
*  The REPO market had a major hiccup a few weeks ago, so the FED has now BECOME the REPO market by offering Billions in overnight and 2 week loans.
* Despite both of these actions being extremely similar to QE, Powell says this is not QE but "reserve management." 
* The Dutch Central Bank just admitted that Gold is the ultimate anchor in case of a monetary reset.
* Negative interest rates in the EU could be a death blow to zombie banks *cough* Deutche Bank *cough*
* India is silently imploding financially as ICICI bank and other banks come under strain from a 10% default rate on their loans in the real estate sector. Rumors of banks not honoring customer deposits have been circulating.
* Hong Kong is fucked
* China faces fiscal oblivion if they renege on any US deal. They have traditionally reneged on most deals. The current deal has not been signed but is being lauded as a break through.
* Turkey faces the hammer of US sanctions if they fuck up Syria more then they have already. Meanwhile, Syria and by default Russia, have agreed to Support the ADF defense against the Turkish incursion. 
* Iranian and Saudi oil tankers have been attacked within the past month.
* Saudi oil production facilities have also been attacked.  
* US troops are pulling out of Syria, while also deploying to Saudi Arabia. 
We're living in interesting times.

ya it gets confusing because all these new terminologies are not well defined and are often confused by basic users and mixed up. 
But around here we like to distinguish Bitcoin as a decentralized, permisionless Blockchain.
Facebookcon would be a centralized cartel of permissioned users and validators. It's not a blockchain, more like a string of hashes tied together.
both of these can still be digital currencies. the dollar is also a digital currency, as it can be sent through paypal, and from your bank to another bank without you interacting with the paper fiat.
facebookcoin will likely not be a true crypto. if Bitcoin can be purchased with it directly through exchanges, then it might be.

sure thing. the article is a little technical. but the gist of it is that bitcoins supply schedule is fixed and predetermined. ie there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin to ever be mined into existence. The last Bitcoin will be mined in the year 2140 for instance. 
from this we can compare bitcoins inflation rate to other commodities like gold and silver. and so the article demonstrates that bitcoin has the same inflation rate currently as silvers. And ironically, Bitcoins market capitalization has matched that of silvers market capitalization in recent history
Within 8 years, as the bitcoin mining reward decreases, this inflation rate for bitcoin will become better then golds. making Bitcoin very very scarce in terms of production. So if we forecast the price based on this we get a target of 55000 USD within the next couple of years.

excellent question. ledger uses a standardized mnemonic set of seed words (usually 24 words) as a way to backup your wallet/bitcoin. you can take those same 24 words generated by your ledger wallet and import them into most other wallets, including the Trezor hardware wallet to recover your Bitcoin. essentially those 24 words are your bitcoin. more info here:

I personally look at the cost to produce one Bitcoin as a baseline for fair value. Hut8 mining [released a recent report]( saying they can produce 1 Bitcoin for "US$2,757 compared to US$3,950 in the previous quarter"
So that's a good price range to keep in mind, as it's the cost of production range for Bitcoin miners.

from experience, there's a lot of technical steps to mulisig. combining that with a hardware wallet is another step too. so yes its very secure, but there's more backup information you would need to keep safe as a result, and there's therefore more risk of screwing up a step in the process. so theft is not the real threat for this method, but user error.
the simple/straight forward method with good security and less user error is going for the ledger/trezor. its not the best grade A++ security, but it's good enough for 50 bitcoins.

In my mind, gold is money and so is Bitcoin. Both have no counter party, if you hold it.
Both have their weaknesses and strengths. it's not an either or for me, but it's a how much of these two can I sustainably accumulate without living in a cardboard box.
In terms of upside potential, Bitcoin wins no question. In terms of downside potential, Bitcoin also wins, no question. Holding Gold gives me confidence to invest in Bitcoin. It's like a reserve asset that can be used as a psychological backstop insurance policy in case this shit doesn't work out.
Both these assets are fighting the same battle.

I think this is a fair question that has a reasonable answer. The nice thing about Bitcoin is you don't need permission to send it around the world. It acts very much like file sharing, or torrents, and so its very hard for the government to shutdown. But they can of course say its illegal to use, but that will not stop people from using, as seen in the case of torrenting. Similarly, in the past, [gold was also confiscated]( but not everyone obeyed this order. Many decided to bury their gold and sit on it for decades before gold was legal to buy and sell again in the USA. 
With Bitcoin you don't have this problem of fixed location that gold has. you can easily send it around the world and exchange it for goods in jurisdictions that allow bitcoin purchases (you don't even have to be in the jurisdiction to do this). furthermore, the internet is more of a extra-judicial unlegislated jurisdiction that governments have not yet been able to fully control and compel legislative compliance over. It's almost like ther internet is the digital version of maritime law.
In addition, I could buy physical gold or silver on in case of the worst. there's also openbazzar, darknet markets, and other jurisdictions that will gladly exchange my bitcoin for USD. 
Alternatively, there are 1000s of other cryptocurrencies that I could exchange my Bitcoin for and use in the jurisdiction where Bitcoin is illegal. 
There are way too many loop holes for this technology to escape a legislative ban. At most it may be forced underground like gold was, but it will survive.

I'm hijacking your comment for a video that everyone in Hong Kong needs to watch, and the Bitcoin community needs to be aware of:
summery: it's with Kyle Bass (hedge fund guy who was one of the characters in The Big Short). He talks about the risk behind Hong Kong losing its preferred status by the US and Britain if they approve the new law on Wednesday, allowing for extradition of Hong Kong citizens to China. As a result, if Hong Kong loses this special status, tariffs could apply to them (currently USA tariffs against China do not apply to Hong Kong). Furthermore, 80% of Hong Kong's reserves to defend their currency have been drawn down within the past year. They have 20% reserves left to defend their Hong Kong - Dollar peg. 
In summery, their is a possibility of the Hong Kong dollar peg being broken, and the potential for capital flight from Hong Kong if Wednesdays law passes, and Trump decides to invalidate Hong Kong special status as a result.
Noe: this is more of a long term potential domino sequence that could start with Wednesdays extradition bill passing.

Nothing prevents them form enacting legislation. But its very hard to enforce that regulation on a self-sustaining and healing technology that can function anywhere with a internet connection. 
For now, governments are content to be generous in leaving this space alone as long as no one gets hurt. 
In an extreme case, the NSA would have the most damaging effect on a network like bitcoin. They do most likely monitor the Bitcoin network for nefarious activities. They also likely conduct research on how to disrupt such networks. So it is possible for them to temporarily disrupt the network.
However, in the cyber world, there is always a counter measure for every attack. an adaption may take some time, but it will come. there's a 100 billion incentive for the network to keep runnnng.

I'm a mod over at and our Canadian Bitcoin community is suffering this loss very deeply. If any professional bitcoiners can offer support to this case it would be very much appreciated by the victims of this event.
I recommend that someone with skin in this game who also has the brains, time and money use a chain analysis tool like  to track down the cold wallets to ensure they have not or do not move. If the crypto cold wallet funds have moved after the date of death (December 9th) of Mr Cotten, then the crypto funds have either been hacked or been moved by the directors of QuadrigaCX (and is contrary to what they are claiming here), or another party. This could be a key piece to any lawsuit.
Also be sure to look for QuadrigaCX/Quadriga Fintech Solutions/0894750 B.C. Ltd   to be listed here in the coming week(s) to confirm that they have filed for creditor protection: 
Good luck everyone.

~~I think you have it mixed up. the default output is two. One amount goes to the address/person you want the majority of funds to be sent to, and the other amount is a transaction fee sent to the miners for processing the bigger main output of funds.~~
~~some of the time there is only one input and two outputs.~~
~~other times there are several inputs and 2 outputs, or even several inputs and several outputs.~~
edit: my bad i was wrong about this. a transaction can have only one input and one output. its just that often the amount you are sending is not the exact amount you need to send from the previously received transaction/output. So often this previous chunk of bitcoin/output is broken in two. one piece is sent to your receiver/friend and the other is sent back to you own wallet as change.
Also, if the previous input is too small, you can collect several other inputs together to reach the amount you need to send. but even then you will likely have 8 outputs, as the amounts rarely are exactly the same.
also, like others have said, the Miner fee is not an output. It is the difference between total inputs and total outputs.
here is an example:

All the girls need is to download this app on their phones. 
its a bitcoin wallet. it allows anyone to receive bitcoins (internet needs to be enabled/wifi for transactions to be shown) or send bitcoins from their phone. 
so they could walk around with their phone to receive payment OR, they could print out the QR code (its the barcode for their bitcoin address) and have it on them (maybe ontop of a fake 100 dollar bill). that way a customer could then pay by scanning the QR code and sending bitcoins to that address with their phone. 
You could even have a bitcoin ATM at your bar to enable customers to do this. would be kind of a neat mini ecosystem for bitcoin.
Imagine a screen in the bar that has a leaderboard for the girls based on their bitcoin deposits, totally easy to set up.
so many ways to get creative with this.

Armory can be really useful if it runs properly. Historically this is a common problem to just get it set up.
But once it is, there are a tonne of features that are more user friendly then bitcoin core. This includes multi signature accounts/addresses that allow you to have lots of signatures, instead of just the standard 2 of 3 in electrum with no customizability. 
I personally used this for added security by creating multisig addresses to hold my coins until i bought a trezor, and it worked nicely on a windows machine. I had no luck on linux/ubuntu though.

I'm really confused by this whole debate. I really don't know who to believe, but it really concerns me when people say that XT is basically an altcoin trying to hijack the Bitcoin network.
I'm just a regular somewhat tech savy bitcoin hobbyist by the way, so the technicals of this debate are beyond me. 
But what I want to know is, if we are going to use XT, who can then change or manipulate it latter on? will "consensus" (whatever that means) need to be used again for another change? Will this switch to XT centralize power into fewer hands, ie a few developers? If that's the case I want nothing to do with it.

OR 
would I only receive 5001$ CAD worth of shares in your company (with nothing deposited into my account), and have the 0.1% trading fee applied to my accounts current and future trades.
As a hobbyist I really prefer option one.

Your US institutional options include kraken.com, coinbase.com or gemini.com 
I would recommend using kraken or gemini (especially if you are in new york). be sure to register an account in the name of your school to avoid any personnel tax implications (you may want to get your schools accounting department involved) or your director of finance.
when you register an account and receive the bitcoin funds with that account, your school then needs to decide whether to covert all, or some of those bitcoin into fiat dollars (likely a board decision).
when the school does decide to make a bitcoin to US dollar conversion, be sure to use the OTC-desk option with either kraken or gemini to save on conversion fees.
good luck.
if your school board is feeling especially ambitious with their newfound bitcoin wealth they may want to consider earning Bitcoin interest on some of their Bitcoin by using services like Blockfi.com
edit: its also a good idea to make sure that your schools institutional account requires multiple parties from your board of directors to approve any transaction. you don't want one director walking away with the Bitcoin, which can happen if he/she is the only one with read/write privileges to the account.

our current monetary system is a legislated one. politicians enact laws that give the federal reserve the exclusive right to print money and charge interest to the banks for it.
bitcoin circumvents traditional monetary systems, in that it is coded, self regulating, self reinforcing software. 
What this means is that if you download the bitcoin software and try and change it without everyone else changing the software along with you, you will be kicked off the network. therefore the rules of the software dictate the parameters of the monetary system. Not the government, not law makers, and not private shareholders. public open source software, that anyone can propose to change, and can change, as long as everyone agrees.

posted this in another thread, but maybe someone else here will have a response. I get the impression that there's a lot of politics and knee jerk reactions going on.
can anyone verify the following impression I'm getting?
1. Blocksize testing happens - oh look that's an issue
2. Bitcoin core sits on their asses
3. Gaven + Mike team up to try and light a fire under their asses to fix this issue before it becomes a problem by introducing XT. 
The problem I have with this is that I can see the Bitcoin core perspective as more valid then what Is trying to be done with XT. First of all, the blocksize issue doesn't appear to be an imminent threat causing mass devastation/interruption. Though I agree it could. evidence of this was seen with the stress tests causing backlogs of blocks, raising fees, unconfirmed blocks TEMPORARILY.
this was artificial traffic bought with a price. we aren't at a place yet were the network vitally NEEDS an upgrade due to natural traffic. But, we will be.
With that said, I think choosing XT RIGHT NOW and the risks associated with that kind of choice are greater then the risks associated with waiting for the Bitcoin core devs to implement a solution that everyone can agree on. We have time is what I'm trying to say.
And until there is an actual prolonged distribution in service that causes doubt, XT will remain a choice of last resort, for me (currently. please try and change my mind), and others I'm sure.
Now my hope is that Gavin and Mikes intentions with XT are to try and motivate the core team to do something, not to make an alternative Bitcoin where there is less decentralization where they become king makers. 
If the first intention is true, then I can see its merit from a Machiavellian perspective. But this isn't Florence, this is bitcoin. going rogue and injecting that kind of energy into the space should only be done as a last resort. And perhaps it has and is.
That's my layman analysis.

storing bitcoin is one of the funnest parts to all this.
in the crypto space we have a term for storage, either cold storage or hot storage. cold storage is much more secure than hot storage.
hot wallets include things like mobile wallets (apps like mycelium) desktop wallets (like bitcoin core).
cold wallets include hardware wallets that generate your nuclear launch codes in the most secure way possible. on a secure chip, independent of the desktop/laptop ecosystem. examples of this include ledger nano, trezor wallet, keepykey, opendime, and more. 
the last way to store bitcoin is by holding it on an exchange, which really means you are letting someone else hold it for you. From a security perspective, this is the least secure super hot wallet.

I'll give you a really watered down version of mining.
mining is a competition to see who can come up with the correct [hash]( (string of numbers) first. 
hashing as fast as possible gives you the best chance at winning the game. Each time someone wins the game, they are rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins. The game then resets. The difficulty of the game automatically adjusts so that people win/the game resets every 10 minutes.
so every 10 minutes 12.5 new bitcoin are created (currently).

It's ok because of the lightning network, its a second layer plugged into the Bitcoin layer that have made transaction times zero. 
China does not control these mining farms in China, multiple Chinese business men do. Even if China were to seize all these mining assets within their territory, they could still not destroy the Blockchain, they could only disrupt it, making transactions slow, or reversing very new transactions. Users would simply need to wait for an extended period of time to settle their bitcoin transactions, and even then Lightning could prove to be an effective method of escaping the nuisance caused by this cartel like behavior (which would also be immensely costly in several ways for China). There are also several other counter measures, Bitcoin is not toothless.
pool mining is ok since their are multiple pools, with no one pool owning a majority of the computing power (hashrate).


faster, no -&gt;see lightning. cheaper, maybe if your pinching micro pennies, but again no, see lightning. more securely then Bitcoin? NO. proof of work is the gold standard of security, all else is marketing. Bitcoin has in many cases 100X the proof of work hashrate when measured against other shitcoins.
They're features are redundant and do not have anywhere near the size in network effect as Bitcoin.
Because it's the reserve currency for the crypto-economy. look at all the trading pairs on exchanges. What do you see? Almost all are denominated in Bitcoin. It's won the ground game by being first, large, and strong. The other blockchains are marketing gimics. compare the metrics that matter, hashrate, userbase, wallet activity, network activity, transactions. 
go do some more research.

Kind of a strange situation here. Reading between the lines: basically this bitcoin miner bought Bitmain equipment on loan from bitmain, but failed to honor the contract and also failed to expand the facility in order to host this mining equipment. Bitmain sued their asses for reneging on the deal, meanwhile this same company received hundreds of thousands of loonie loans from the provincial government ([which by the way the province is also on the verge of bankruptcy for the muskrat falls debacle](

more details on the PIN: its only numbers based, you can have up to 9 numbers as a pin. Everytime someone fails to enter the correct PIN you have to wait a certain period of time to enter in the PIN again. Every failure to enter the correct PIN doubles this time period, rendering brute-forcing the password improbable.

by backups I mean root keys. either those string of words you get from mycelium or the four letter series you get from armory. A secure way to store these kinds of backups is on offline devices that you can lock in internal memory. Like digital cameras or TI calculators. TI calculators are great because they are basically mini computers that you can install password programs on, very useful. Plus, its not an obvious storage medium for thieves. its just an old calculator after all. (Make sure you remove the batteries and Archive the root keys to the internal memory.)

This is why Bitcoin changes the game. value is now 12 words you have memorized that give you access to your wealth. Anywhere with a internet connection. 
No one can prove or disprove that you have this access without significant and unwarranted use of force. 
This is a public policy problem for governments. Bitcoin has subverted their wealth tracking and restriction capabilities for the time being. An effort will be made to create significant barriers of entry to acquire bitcoin by governments. This can start with small things like, the NYC bitlicense. But it could devolve into further extreme measures, such as confiscation. A similar thing happened to gold owners in the united states in the 1930's, where private gold owners were mandated to hand in their physical gold by the federal government. 
Luckily, governments are usually slow to act, so we have some time until a manufactured headline spurs the masses to take action to save the populace from the evil monster of crytpocurrency.

its one of the best features about Bitcoin. you dont have to ask anyone's permission to send, receive, buy, sell, store, move, transfer, gift, or mine Bitcoin. You could even build your own wallet from scratch and interact with the protocol if you have the programming and technical know how.
Other systems are not permissionless, ie they require permission to use. Your bank needs to verify your identity to open a bank account, you need to ask permission to move that bank account money from one bank to another digitally. You need to ask permission from the ATM terminal to withdraw cash (and often this is capped). once you have cash, that is a more permissionless form of money then digital dollars on your computer screen. As you can give physical dollars to anyone usually. Much like Bitcoin.
This is why people say Bitcoin has the properties of digital cash.
digital dollars do not have these permisionless properties.

By my estimates, if we charge .13 cents per kilowatt hour (the average price of power in Ontario) multiplied (X) by 500000KW/h (=500MW/h) = $65000 (CAD) per hour...
That's insane, and probably not accurate considering most miners in China are paying peanuts for their power.
With that said, it's interesting to see that approximately $65000 worth of energy is being injected into the Bitcoin network per hour! That's 1.2 million dollars per day.
and with 1800 Bitcoins mined per day at a price of 804 CAD$ = $1.45 Million CAD
I think this kind of index would be very useful to know, since it kind of establishes the base price for what a Bitcoin is worth. If the price of Bitcoin reaches or even falls below this price point, then it's probably a very good time to buy. I'd very much like to give this kind of idea a name, (The Bitcoin Cost of Power Correlation BCPC) or perhaps it already has one I'm not aware of.

When it comes to the $15 billion recorded music industry, the artists rarely come out with a big payoff.  The recorded music industry began in the late 1800s with the invention of Thomas Edison’s phonograph and benefited greatly from the rise of radio broadcasting in the 1920s. However, back in those days, for the artist, it meant that in order for their music to be heard, they would have to make deals with a series of intermediaries, such as record labels, publishers, and distributors. Almost 100 years later, musicians still must go through this archaic system of intermediaries developed before the advent of the internet, where the artists lose up to 86% of the proceeds from their music.
This is where blockchain comes in. Much like our experience in international payroll processing, the music industry can benefit from the existence of blockchain technology. Any industry that in encumbered by inefficient intermediaries is in danger of disruption, and the music industry is ripe for it. There are many blockchain oriented startups in this area, but two of them shine through as having a unique, innovative perspective on what should be done.
UjoMusic’s initial manifesto at TheProblem.WTF immediately offered a simple, understandable value proposition:
Shouldn’t it be possible in a digital world for the royalties to come directly to you, instead of through a slow, inefficient, and opaque chain of collection societies and publishing administrators?
Their characterization of the music industry’s troubles is as slick a piece of writing on an industry wide blockchain application as I’ve seen this year, but it dates back to the summer of 2015. They collaborated with Imogen Heap to release her song, Tiny Human, on the Ethereum blockchain through an alpha version of their solution in October of 2015. The way this worked was that users would create a wallet on alpha.ujomusic.com, and send Ether, the digital currency of the Ethereum blockchain, to it. Once the wallet was funded, the user would send money to a smart contract, which would issue a license to the user, granting them the MP3 file, while simultaneously paying out directly to Imogen and the other members of her team.
I spoke with Jesse Grushack, Director of UjoMusic, regarding the inefficiencies of the music industry,
There are three main avenues for music distribution, mainstream channels (such as radio, TV, bars), digital service providers (such as Spotify and Apple Music) and direct channels (such as soundcloud).  
 With the mainstream channels, you run into two issues, accessibility and payments. In order to get access, you typically need to go through one of the big three record labels, Sony, Warner and Universal. Then, if you want to get paid, you have to join one of three Performing Rights Organizations (PROs) that are regulated and controlled. It can take up to two years for the artist to see their payments, and they have absolutely no insight into what is happening in the meantime.
With digital service providers, licensing deals are negotiated directly with the labels and publishers without the need of PROs, since these are not public performances. While this may create efficiencies and cost savings for those negotiating, it is only the Beyonce’s of the world that benefit.

My two cents. We may be getting to a point where miners are getting squeezed at these prices for bitcoin. 
I beleive hut8minings cost to produce one Bitcoin is around 3400$ USD, and they are one of the most efficient miners out there. so imagine everyone else. We are defiantly in a territory where miners with expensive hardware/electricity/facility costs need to start shutting down. not only that, but there's a hash war going on with some other sha256 coins that may be sucking some hash power away.
so I don't think this move is over, but it's defiantly a good thing for the miners who stick around and can hold out at these prices. more bitcoin for them.
If they can survive to the next bull run...then they are golden.
short term - expect a overall 20% reduction of hashrate from the peak. If prices continue to fall, expect a further reduction in proportion. If we go below 3400, expect miners to be making some hard choices. this could have a negative feedback loop on price/hashrate as they tend to reflect one another in a self fulfilling prophecy as traders point to the declining hashrate as a reason to short.
Things could get ugly in the medium to long term as miners shut down in mass, effectively crashing the sha256 mining market. mass liquidations of hardware for cheap on ebay and the such could further lead to an opportunity for savvy miners sitting on cash wanting to get back in. but more then likely, the majority of miners will get burned by this collapse in mining and never return, thereby further centralizing hash power to a select few who can mine at cost or even below cost. at this point you could either see increasing decentralization or centralization of mining (if this scenario plays out). It could happen, but its not likely. 
Long term, if this collapse does play out, it will be a good opportunity for those sitting on the sidelines with cash wanting to get in on the mining game, Since it could be the end of Bitmain as we know it.
It could even lead to a changing of the hashing algorithm if the community becomes despondent/desperate enough. but that's way out there.

unfortunately, this is no longer the case. QuadrigaCX has not released the majority of fiat withdrawals to customers for the past three months due to legal issues with their banking partners. however, there is  light at the end of the tunnel, they are apparently supposed to be receiving their banking funds back within the next two week, so fingers crossed.
as a result of no fiat withdrawals, the price of bitcoin on their exchange is often 10% higher then market price. people could still withdrawal Bitcoin this way, but today they instituted bitcoin withdrawal limits for the first time in their history.
not good.

I've used all of them except the keepkey. I used the ledger nano s the most in the past year. The year before that I used the Trezor model One the most. I am now switching back to using the Trezor model T the most, since I am wary of ledger's downloaded app/spyware that sends data back to their servers without the ability to shut this off. I have used altcoins in the past with these devices, but I mainly stick to bitcoin. Monero is the only other one I am majorly interested in, but I have not used any hardware wallet with it yet, since I am suspect of the support surrounding it (the support for it is too new). The wallet on the furthest left is the coldwalet made by coinkite in Canada, the same makers of the opendime. Its probably the most hard to use wallet, with the most paranoid safety features on the market. I dont use it, ease of use with the trezor and ledger nano is a warm blanket I have yet to crawl out of.

precisely, it can be done and is much easier then people initially assume. it will take a month maximum. 
start with 4 words and repeat them before sleeping in your mind. then add two more each day until you can repeat back all 24 in your mind.
a helpful way to remember these words, is to find their association with each other, or by using symbols in your minds eye to lock them in place. verbs and object words are the easiest to remember. adjectives are little trickier. 
repeating them to yourself in your head as often as possible will help speed things up.
i just repeated mine while typing this. I've used this skill to recover a wallet on a trezor/ledger twice, without having to go find the paper backup.

There's a lot of weird details behind this Squire mining company. They are currently in talks with coingeek to buy/merge their mining farm of 1000TH into the company. apparently this is already up and running under the coingeek umbrella. 
but there's also been another side company of squire that was claiming to have the most efficient bitcoin mining prototype on the market (claiming to be about 25% more efficient/powerful then the competition).
coingeek was supposed to be the one to market/promote these miners and sell them to customers.
but that all seems to be up in the air now since apparently, the miners, no surprisingly, are not up to spec. 
as a consequence, the stock price for squire mining is now in the dumps down 25% on the day to 0.19 cents CANADIAN. It reached a high of 82 cents back in September...
And the CEO just resigned. the second CEO to resign in less then a year...

from my understanding, some of his examples were of private enterprise level blockchains, so you do not need to necessarily own bitcoin to make such examples work. However, it is yet to be known how secure these private blockchains will be in the long run, since many of them have centralized features that can be a positive or negative depending on how you look at it. ie, great for regulators and conglomerate cartels, not so great for the little guy. 
on the question of the us government buying bitcoin to help regulate. I think the core of this question is trying to figure out, can bitcoin be regulated if the government buys bitcoin. The simple answer to that is no, not at all. But maybe in a proof of stake system, yes. so it depends. keep going down that rabbit hole!

seed word protection? My thoughts on this are that there needs to be a balance between guarding against losing your seed words vs having them stolen. In my mind, it's more likely that you will loose your seed words then you are to have them stolen. But first making sure they are generated properly, and not generated for you by a third party/man in the middle is also important. Always order a hardware wallet directly form the manufacturer is my rule as a result. multiple backups is highly recommended. securing those backups through obfuscation is also key in my mind. Using a 25th word as a password is also ideal and recommended (especially for the trezor one, as it is currently vulnerable without one, as shown by wallet.fail). 
memorizing your seed words is also recommended, it can/has been done.
if you loose your phyical hardware wallet, you should treat it just like if you were to loose your credit card. cancel your credit card/migrate to a different hardware wallet with different seed words.

Finally, there are direct channels, and while this does a good job of removing intermediaries, you lose a lot of insight into who is licensing your music and how they are using it.
UjoMusic plans to address these issues with the release of their closed beta by the end of 2016. The system combines the transparent attribute of a blockchain with smart contract technology. Users will be able to buy different types of licenses, such as the right to play in a commercial, in a bar, in a youtube video, or just when sitting at home with friends, by sending ether to a wallet that can be easily branded as the artist’s own. A smart contract is then executed which will determine the type of license purchased based on the amount paid, deliver the music to the user, immutably maintain a record of the contract bought on the blockchain, and then pay directly to all the stakeholders involved in the creation of the music. While removing intermediaries in both the distribution and payment processes, this solution adds another layer of transparency that helps artists ensure that when they see their music being used in various ways, that it has been properly licensed, while providing an easy way for a licensee to prove their ownership of the correct license.  
PeerTracks is another solution leveraging blockchain technology to change how artists interact with their userbase. Unlike UjoMusic, which will replace the existing studios and rights management with something transparent and content producer-centric, PeerTracks envision some dramatic changes in how musicians build relationships with their user base.
Whereas UjoMusic acts as a tool for artists to directly connect with the users licensing their products from their own homepage, PeerTracks behaves more like a digital service provider with a twist. Songs and albums can be streamed, downloaded, everyone who is supposed to get paid does, and PeerTracks proudly compares their 5% fee to Apple’s 30% take, while noting the difficulties for artists to gain access to the iTunes store.
Artists can sell ‘Notes’, which are a sort of multifaceted security tied directly to the artists themselves. Artists can use the Notes to figure out who their biggest fans are, offering them perks such as free concert tickets or early previews of new work. Functionally this is a well reasoned prediction market; rising stars will be discoverable by watching their Notes value.  
Recommended by Forbes
So where does blockchain come in? The Notes can be bought and sold, their value goes up the more an artist’s content is streamed or downloaded, so a fan can promote a band and watch the value of the Notes they own rise. These Notes are all tokens on the blockchain, allowing them to be freely tradeable for Notes and currencies without requiring intermediaries in the process.
Notes are subject to the market force of each artist’s NoteBot, a software agent funded by streaming and music sales that purchases Notes on the open market and then shreds them. This mechanism effectively increases the value of the notes as an artist becomes more popular by shrinking the supply of Notes which are limited in number.
Will UjoMusic’s efficiency in a familiar environment receive quicker uptake than PeerTracks, which requires some thought, as it integrates things that are currently external to the revenue model? The first fosters artistic innovation, the second both artistic and business model innovation. It isn’t clear which one will get traction, and these are by no means the only efforts to reform the music industry, which makes this a very interesting area to observe.

A Cypherpunk's Manifesto by Eric Hughes
Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.
If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of their interaction. Each party can speak about their own memory of this; how could anyone prevent it? One could pass laws against it, but the freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to an open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all. If many parties speak together in the same forum, each can speak to all the others and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other parties. The power of electronic communications has enabled such group speech, and it will not go away merely because we might want it to.
Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary for that transaction. Since any information can be spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as possible. In most cases personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my provider only need know how to get the message there and how much I owe them in fees. When my identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction, I have no privacy. I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must always reveal myself.
Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.
Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it. If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no privacy. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy. Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when the default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.
We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect that they will speak. To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the realities of information. Information does not just want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill the available storage space. Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor.
We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place. People have been defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. The technologies of the past did not allow for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.
We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.
Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we write. We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.
Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is fundamentally a private act. The act of encryption, in fact, removes information from the public realm. Even laws against cryptography reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence. Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible.
For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract. People must come and together deploy these systems for the common good. Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's fellows in society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive ourselves. We will not, however, be moved out of our course because some may disagree with our goals.
The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for privacy. Let us proceed together apace.

you don't need the wallet.dat file or even your password. all you really need is the private key.
you can import the private key into a web wallet like blockchain.info, a mobile wallet like mycelium, or a desktop wallet like bitcoin core.
simply download the wallet of your choice and then google import private key followed by the wallet name and you will find instructions on how to do so.

@_date: 2019-09-09 03:01:07
your sisters coinbase wallet address will be different from the on you deleted.
think of wallet addresses like email addresses. they are used for sending and receiving bitcoin, just like different emails can be used to send a file between say hotmail and gmail. 
so for example. currently you have a hotmail address 3abcdeff123456789012341234
and your bitcoin are sitting in 3abcdeff123456789012341234
when you open your coinbase account, its like opening a new gmail email address, which will be different from your hotmail address (3abcdeff123456789012341234).
now think of your bitcoin like a file. currently that bitcoin file is sitting in your hotmail account, with an address of 3abcdeff123456789012341234
and you want to get that file(bitcoin) to your gmail(coinbase account).
so you need to know the coinbase address to send this too. you will get access to this address when you open a new coinbase account. usually this is identified in a section called `receive` within the platform.
it will be entirely different from 3abcdeff123456789012341234

even if they were all recorded it would still not matter because the discrete log problem is perfectly random, so no correlation can be found given trillions^trillions of data points.

its best to open an exchange account soon, either gemini, kraken, or coinbase. those are the three big regulated exchanges in the USA. 
once ~~you~~ your sister creates an account you can send the bitcoin to her exchange wallet who holds your bitcoin on her behalf, just like a bank.
its best to verify her identify with the exchange first before depositing bitcoin just in case. they will likely want a photo copy of her drivers license, and proof of address documents like a pdf of a monthly bank statement.
after that you can withdraw USD from the exchange to her bank account. 
Because of taxes, its best that you get your sister to open the bitcoin exchange account in her name, since it is her gift. you dont want the tax man sniffing around your bank account asking questions when you were just trying to help your sister out, but got tangled up in a transaction involving a gift for her.
Try and see if you can help your sister open the exchange account with her. Try not to do it for her using your name and bank account, it can complicate things.
once she opens an exchange account, you can then send her bitcoin to her exchange wallet address. this will be a very important step, as it will likely be your first bitcoin transaction, so be sure to a test transaction first to see if it works with a small amount of bitcoin. if it works, send the rest of the bitcoin over to the exact same exchange wallet address. 
a bitcoin wallet address looks like this, but the characters will be different for your first transaction to an exchange: 3DjQXxUrQRSoK4G4dgbVKeoUgxTmf4Qzdk
once she has the bitcoin in her exchange account she can then sell them for USD. Once she sells the Bitcoin for USD to she can request to withdraw that USD to her bank account.
there are nuances involved in all of this, its a bit of learning experience. but if you need help please let me know.

the best way isn't usually to use a bitcoin atm, their fees are horrible. if there is a local bitcoin service/exchange in your country they are probably a better way to buy bitcoin.
also bitcoin atms dont have margin. margin is primarily used on exchange like platforms like bifinex or binance to leverage your bitcoin in a short or long position. its not recommended unless you know what you're doing or are willing to learn, often this can be painful at first as making trading mistakes in the beginning is inevitable.

Use a old/new Texas instruments calculator.
using the program button you can store and record your data/seed inside the offline calculator, and have it saved to the internal memory.
In addition, you can also code into the calculator a password program, that prompts you to enter a pin into the calculator on start up.
An old gameboy/super nintendo/SEGA cartridge from your favorite game can be used for the same purpose.
split up the key on a combination of these options and have your partner/family take care of a piece.
But honestly, people should be memorizing their seeds as an additional backup method. and its really not that hard to memorize 24 words over the course of a month...
one method of memorizing your seed is to first write it down and hide it in a safe, but retrievable place. then memorize 4 words your first day. then add two more words for 6 words after another 2 days, then 8, and so on. you'll be at 24 in less than a month. another trick to help you do this is to create story with the words by making them into grammatically correct (though not necessarily understandable) sentences. also, associating the words together through a commonality is a great idea to retain them in your RAM hole. visualizing the words, especially if they are objects can also help.
example: witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least
witch, easy, its an object easily remembered and visualized. it can also be related to the next words (collapse) since witch is an agent of chaos and chaos creates collapse.
so witch collapse, easy. Adding a to in between for "witch to collapse" can also help.
next three can be strung together, practice feed shame, a witch is practice(ing) feed-shame on hansle and grettle to make them feel bad (cause shes a witch)
so practice feed shame
next five words are easy and run together to make sense as a spell by the witch, open despair-creek-road again!
last two words, ice, (in reference to the creek and water and ice). least (tricky word, so add "to the" before hand, for "ice to the least" as a second part of the spell.
So we get:
witch to collapse
practice feed shame
open despair creek road again!
ice to the least

its best to learn by doing I find. 
first step is to get a wallet. wallets are free and allow you to hold, take possession of, store, send and receive your bitcoin. 
see this link for a good list of bitcoin wallets 
Once you have set up one of the above wallets, you'll be ready to receive bitcoin. 
I can guide you through the process if you like.
this article might also help 
wallets are kind of like email clients, just like hotmail, gmail or yahoo mail. all of these can send and receive email. just like this, bitcoin has many wallets available, most of them have unique features, but all of them allow you to send and receive bitcoin.

This is also becoming a problem is Canada recently. seems to be every where now, and exclusive to localbitcoins.com
I wrote a [brief article]( describing our situation in Canada. sounds exactly like yours.
from our Canadian reports, it could be much more serious then previously thought. There is evidence to suggest that hackers are first compromising bank accounts AND localbitcoins.com accounts and using these as sock puppets to scam bitcoin sellers.
One victim had money clawed back out of his bank account AFTER he paid a number of credit card bills. so his bank account went into overdraft, and he needs to pay the bank soon plus overdraft fees before being charged interest on the negative balance.
this scam is being enabled by the banks who unquestionably reverse etransfers for the scammers, after these estransfers have “settled” in the victims bank accounts. Localbitcoins.com may also be complicit in this scam if they do not provide relevant information to the proper authorities.

depends on if you need the money or not. if you have debts, its best to get rid of those as soon as possible, since debt is guaranteed, returns from bitcoin are not.

Truthfully its a gut instinct to not buy in until the bubbles done with its purge. The price dip to 155 a couple of months ago tells me we aren't finished with this down trend.

Is there an ideal pace for innovation at all?


You delivered a speech on cryptocurrencies which generated a big echo among fans of Bitcoin. Are cryptocurrencies money?


So, how do you account for the hype surrounding them?


... which were precisely the words that annoyed the crypto-community. You don't think there'll be a happy ending?


The market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies is low, so there is no threat to the financial system. Should central banks intervene at all?






Don't you think it's a positive side effect that Bitcoin has got many young people thinking about money, money creation and the financial system?










and yet the central banks do it all the time...

This is just something I want to throw out there since this thought can be a dangerous one to the success of this project, I'm sure others have had it as well.
When this service starts out it will attract those who want to do nefarious things with their bitcoin, or who have already done illegal activities.
Essentially this service is potentially a virtual laundering service for bitcoin crime. It can work great for the participants who want to cover their tracks due to technical illegality. But what motivation is there for those with cleanly obtained coins to use this service, other then a hopefully competitive interest rate.
As someone with clean coins it feels like I'd be taking a risk exchanging them for dirty ones that have a unknown history behind them. I could be taking on the coins of someone who is a known MGOX hacker for example.
Half the solution to this concern would be to Mix coins based on the jurisdictions of where they come from, so that US coins are being exchanged with China coins and vise versa.
This at least protects users from domestic breaches of bitcoin laws.
BUT, at the end of the day, this service could be labelled as a money laundering service by any government if they discover significant proceeds of crime being laundered through this system. Thus opening up the users to prosecution for just using the service.
Maybe, I'm misunderstanding the mechanism of mixing though?

You just went through the website and changed all the things I pointed out. the 2% fee, the weird pdf that tried extracting data, without showing anything, now works.

What you guys are doing is fucking exciting. but the role out is important, people should know going in what to expect from something so promising so they aren't disappointed when they are hit by the reality. I was trying to figure out if you were too be good to be true.

lots of a free wallets available that don't require you to be 18. but just so you know, there's a difference between a wallet and and exchange/bitcoin buying service. 
a wallet is usually a piece of software/hardware that allows you to store, transfer, send, receive and take possession of your bitcoin into your own custody. kinda like cash in a wallet.
a bitcoin exchange or buying service can act like a wallet that allows you to exchange dollars for bitcoin and bitcoin for dollars. BUT, you typically do not posses the bitcoin on a exchange, you only have claim to it (just like the money in your bank account). so if the exchange gets hacked, goes bankrupt or decides to run away with your money, then you're out of luck. which is why its important to take possession of the bitcoin you buy in a wallet that you own.
there's a good list of these wallets here: 
as for bitcoin buying services, you may want to try cashapp, a bitcoin atm, hodlhodl.com, or bisq

agreed, you really need to watch the full interview for what I'm about to say next.
but he claims that Bitcoin can't be used as a credit instrument, meaning it can't really compete with central banks.
This isn't the case. It can be argued that the lightning network is a credit like bitcoin instrument that is 1 to 1 "backed". 
It's possible that in the future we will see additional 2nd layer lightning like networks on top of Bitcoin that act as credit issuing networks that can issue Bitcoin like debt on a fractional reserve basis (so 2 for every 1 bitcoin would be issued on this 2nd layer network, with embedded/coded interest costs built into the protocol).
So he got a lot of things wrong, but many things right. Can't blame him. He even admitted to not knowing the SEC are now running their own bitcoin nodes. so he seems like a smart genuine guy.

As a huge agar/bitcoin fan, I've been waiting for an agar bitcoin hybrid forever. 
My Experience so far:
Works exactly like the regular agar.io game. I played on the high roller playground for .01 and killed one opponent twice and another opponent once and got a pay out of .0347 so not so bad of a return if you got the skills. However, the arenas are much smaller, and will likely expand if their are more players.
I was able to withdraw .02 to my wallet no problem. 
I've also created a subreddit and will be posting some video tutorials/games/dates and times for tournaments there.
so excited for this.
EDIT: if you are a nooby start out on the faucet playground to get a feel for the game. There's no cost on this playground, and you can win some satoshi's (up to 3000 Is what I've been getting).

By NATHANIEL POPPER
October 11, 2016
Bitcoin was created by libertarian-minded programmers with a deep suspicion of central banks and the national currencies they issue.
Yet it is central banks that are doing some of the most ambitious work of late in trying to harness the technology introduced by Bitcoin.
The central bankers do not want their institutions to own or use Bitcoin itself. Instead, they hope they can use the decentralized method of record-keeping introduced by Bitcoin — known as the blockchain or distributed ledger — to complete and record transactions in the real economy more efficiently, quickly and transparently.
The most enthusiastic central banks — including the Bank of England and the People’s Bank of China — have discussed issuing their national currencies onto some sort of distributed ledger, a name that comes from the concept of several parties keeping records simultaneously.
Blockchains allow several different players to keep a shared spreadsheet using cryptography and so-called consensus mechanisms that provide a way to agree on which transactions happened at what time.
For the central banks, the promise of the technology is that it would allow them to track every pound or renminbi on every step of its travels through the financial system in real time — something that is impossible now. The goal would be to make the financial system more transparent, fast, efficient and secure.
If the central banks succeed, it would be one of the greatest unexpected twists in new technology: An invention aimed at dethroning central banks and making it harder for money to be tracked instead ends up empowering those central banks and making money more easily traceable.
The Bank of England has produced several research papers on the topic. One suggests that the economic benefits of issuing a digital currency on a distributed ledger could add as much as 3 percent to a country’s economic output, thanks to the efficiency it could offer.
A deputy governor at the People’s Bank of China, Fan Yifei, wrote for Bloomberg View that “the conditions are ripe for digital currencies, which can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications.”
And in a speech on Friday, the Fed governor overseeing new technology, Lael Brainard, said the technology had the potential to transform multiple aspects of the financial system.
“We are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, recognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in payments, clearing and settlement,” Ms. Brainard said.
Even the central bank officials who are most enthusiastic about these experiments say it will be years before any central bank issues its own currency onto a live distributed ledger.
Some critics say the public interest in the blockchain has been all talk and no substance — an easy way for stuffy central bankers to appear hip and relevant.
David Andolfatto, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said many of the central banks looking at blockchain technology would be better served by spending time and energy in updating the current software that underlies the financial system.
“If you take a snapshot of the existing plumbing, it looks a bit ugly,” Mr. Andolfatto said. “There’s nothing magical about a blockchain in solving this problem.”
Even within the Fed, though, other researchers and officials have expressed more excitement about the technology.
A week before Ms. Brainard of the Fed gave her speech on distributed ledgers, the chairwoman of the Fed, Janet L. Yellen, was asked about the technology at a congressional hearing. She said that “innovation using these technologies could be extremely helpful and bring benefits to society.”
The Fed has been pushed to act by the big banks that it regulates, many of which are experimenting with distributed ledgers as a way to settle trades and record data and transactions. Just last week, JPMorgan Chase said it was moving toward a public release this year of its “enterprise grade” blockchain.
Most financial institutions and central banks are looking at distributed ledgers that would be maintained on the computers of all the major players in the financial system, including the central bank and the biggest financial institutions.
In the systems being discussed, each player in the system would communicate with all the others anytime money moved in the system, allowing everyone to update the ledgers on their computer systems simultaneously. This would provide multiple backups if the central bank’s computers came under attack. It would also hypothetically allow them to complete transactions much more quickly, and would make it easier to spot rogue actors.
Eric Piscini, who oversees work on blockchain by the consulting firm Deloitte, said that a year ago, central banks were looking at the technology mostly because they wanted to understand what private banks were talking about.
Now, he says, the central banks are embracing the technology to revamp their own infrastructures.
At the headquarters of the Netherlands’ central bank in Amsterdam, Ron Berndsen set up five laptops to run an experimental virtual currency, derived from the Bitcoin software. The coins issued in the system were nicknamed Dukatons, after a 17th-century silver coin used in the time when the Netherlands was a part of the Spanish Empire.
Mr. Berndsen operated the Dukaton system for three months to see what would happen if the central bank were setting the rules and did not have the same limits as Bitcoin. While the experiment was a success, he is now thinking much bigger and is in constant conversation with other central bank officials who are looking at ways to put their own currencies on distributed ledgers.
“There are so many things going on that it is hard to keep track of all the contacts,” said Mr. Berndsen, the head of market infrastructure at the Dutch central bank. “I hear from other central bank colleagues that it is the same everywhere.”
The experimentation so far has taken on many different forms and contemplated many different roles for distributed ledgers to play in the financial system.
Making a payment with Bitcoin

The Russian national bank said last week that it had worked with a consortium of Russia’s biggest banks to develop its own distributed ledger, which it dubbed Masterchain. The Russian institutions have been sending messages on the system but are also looking at it as a potential “component of the new-generation financial infrastructure in the future.”
The Bank of Canada teamed up with the nation’s five largest banks — and the blockchain consulting firm R3 — for what was known as Project Jasper. In a simulation run this summer, the central bank issued so-called CAD-Coins onto a blockchain similar to the one that underlies the Bitcoin alternative known as Ethereum.
The banks used the CAD-Coins to exchange money — in this case fictional money — the way they do at the end of each day to settle their master accounts.
Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said in an interview that while the experiment was a success, a great deal of testing is still necessary before the bank can decide whether distributed ledger technology is ready for the real world.
Critics of blockchain technology have noted the apparent contradiction in central banks’ looking to distributed ledgers.
The blockchain was created to allow Bitcoin transactions to be recorded communally so that a central authority, such as a central bank, would not be necessary. If a central bank is involved and keeping track, why go to the trouble of keeping records communally?
The distributed ledgers being discussed by central bankers also generally lack the openness that has been one of the most attractive attributes of the Bitcoin network.
With Bitcoin, anyone can join the network and help support it, which has helped it win a following. The distributed ledgers being considered by the financial industry and central banks would generally allow only a small number of registered entities to join in and take part in the network.
Mark Carney, the head of the Bank of England, and perhaps the most prominent champion of distributed ledgers, has said that the technology could be worth using for central banks because it would make for a financial system that does not go down even if the central bank’s computer systems are temporarily taken offline.
The Bank of England said last month that it wanted the next version of the bank’s basic software infrastructure to be compatible with distributed ledgers.
Ms. Wilkins said the Bank of Canada was interested in the technology as a way to build a single, shared record of all the transactions among several institutions. That could leave much less money sitting idle while banks reconcile their different ledgers, as now happens.
It would also create a standardized way of recording transactions that would allow all the players in the system to communicate more seamlessly.
“There is currently a whole industry set up to reconcile and audit all these separate ledgers, and you can’t easily connect them,” she said. “This comprehensive shared data source could be a real benefit.”

think of yourself as a cell. you move your cell by using your mouse, and you collect little pieces (dots) to get bigger. but the bigger you get the slower you are. to go faster and accumulate more dots you can split using *space*. You can also eat smaller players to get bigger. But you can also be eaten by bigger players. It's a game of hunting and survival. The biggest wins.
there are some more complex things in the game, like mines. these things act as weapons for the small guys against the bigger guys. if you collide into these mines you will explode into smaller pieces and be more vulnerable to attack. these mines can also be launched against players by pressing (w) which ejects some mass into the mines and makes them activate and launch towards other players. If the launch is successful it explodes another players mass and makes them vulnerable to be eaten by you even though you are smaller.
its a very complex game, even though it looks simple. I recommend trying it out.

Ok, so here's what I've pieced together of the story that's being drawn for us. keep in mind, none of it is likely true, but I think its important to understand the narrative that is being painted with this "evidence".
1. There's some kind of trust that was created that handed over control of 1.1 million bitcoins to David Klieman. 
* At least 100000 of these bitcoins are required to be returned to Wright by 2020. Wright can also barrow funds from the trust. 
1. Wright is likely the beneficiary of the trust. While David Kleiman was the trustee of the trust, who was in charge of securing the 1.1 million bitcoins. 
1. David also appointed someone else, as co-trustee that only he knew the identity of.
1. This anonymous co-trustee could act as trustee in some way as well. 
1. 7 keys were created for this trust, only three were needed for access.
1.   it's likely that both trustees had access to these keys or could gain access, While Wright does not have access to these keys.
1. Control of the trust was supposed to revert to Wright upon Dave's death. The implementation of this would likely be handled by the co-trustee.
1. Dave dies...So control was either given back to Wright, or it was now in the hands of the anonymous co-trustee.
1. However, it appears from this article that the co-trustee is known by Wright/Joseph VaughnPerling and is apparently a "She" 
1.  She will be at a conference this coming September and may possibly be one of the three female presenters listed on the conference website:  
The following is a message posted by Joseph VaughnPerling addressed to the co-trustee:


The implications of this message are as follows:
1. * Wright doesn't have the keys, the co-trustee has the keys
1.  Wright wants access to the keys, but the co-trustee is obligated to withhold them from him until 2020
1. therefore, Wright can still make a loan of some kind, that the co trustee could authorize to move funds to his account (possibly even from a specific block ie genesis block funds).
1. Wright could also claim sovereignty of the trust, since it is supposed to revert to his control upon Kliemans death.  
In any case, if all of this is true, there is some kind of power struggle happening behind the scenes surrounding this trust, Wright, the co-trustee, and the beneficiaries of the trust, who could be more than the just wright. 
Also its possible to expect something early Friday morning Eastern time, since the conference call between the beneficiaries is supposed to happen at that time.
But it may be possible that a woman is in control of satoshi's keys. cool. and possibly one of these three woman: 
oh, also, its 5000$ to attend one of these events taught be any of these woman. each.
This was just me going down the rabbit hole, none of it should be taken as fact. but its possible.

He talks about the concepts of Voice and Exit. As an individual in society you can voice your objections to something you don't like: such as voting or making a complaint. Voice is the soft power option. 
The hard power option is Exit. If you really don't like something you can just leave and build that something you want into reality in an environment that allows this. Example: on top of sending a complaint to the FED that you don't like them demonetizing your Fiat Currency (Voice) you also create a digital currency that is hard wired to prevent inflation and you adopt and promote this currency. That is the exit.
he goes on to give examples of exit's and possible outcomes/scenarios around exiting out of the old systems through technology. He ends by advocating that we should all start thinking about ways in which we can build exits to prevent "lock-in". It's worth the watch.

The fee is pretty steep compared to other options though, plus I think your bank will charge you on top of that fee for the e-transfer. So you'd end up paying over $400 per BTC at today's market rate of $364. Not a good option if you want a large amount, but an easy one if you want to dip your toe in.
@_date: 2017-07-13 02:16:11
he posed with a picture of his bitcoin address after the event when people expressed interest in tipping him. 
this address is like an email address, so anyone who has bitcoin can send him some. many people sent him less then 5 dollars worth, others sent more. 365 people enjoyed it so much that they wanted to give him a tip, so they did, through the power of bitcoin.
nothing really planned, it kind of just organically happens around here. people like meme magix.

My new obsession is bitcoin integration into gaming. there are already a couple gaming apps like oh crop where you can win bitcoin by being better then everyone else (100$ up for grabs each cycle). And then there are faucet game apps that pay out small amounts for game versions like candy crush or flappy bird by bitplay.today.

Here's another angle people aren't looking at besides the renting out your car for driving purposes.
What hasn't been considered is earning cash for supplying power to the power grid with the battery in your electric vehicle when you are not using it. 
Someone might be asking, well how can I make money off of power supply I'm buying from the grid anyways?
You can do this because different rates are charged during "peak periods" when the power grid is under a lot of strain. The highest rate for power is usually on Monday-fridays from 9-5pm. While the lowest rate for power consumption is on the weekends.
So essentially, you can use your Tesla to arbitrage power. Buying or charging up during down periods, using the charge that you need, and selling any excess charge during peak periods.

I use QuadrigaCX to buy my BTC, they're fees are fairly small (1% to deposit .5% to buy/sell) but you likely need to get verified, which means uploading ID. 
7% is the norm in the market for buying BTC without ID from venders.
Using localbitcoins is probably a better option  for anonymity though, with lower fees than 7%, but higher then quadriga.

gift cards are defiantly a good way to go. but cash is very tricky to get without revealing who you are.
If you're really serious about the cash, try localbitcoins, or maybe even bitsquare. If you're willing to take the fee hit, bitcoin atm's might also work.
but I must caution you a week in each place may not be enough time for delivery logistics using purse.io, but you may want to try without something small to see if it works for you.

Bitcoin is inherently seen as a betrayal of old people who have the majority of the money (fiat). Since most people who have money (fiat) are older, they inherently abhor and see any alternatives to their large collection of money (in aggregate) as a betrayal and affront to their money fiat team. It's really just a natural reaction in self interest. They have a higher stake in the dollar since they own most of them. Furthermore, Bitcoin is the money of the future. These old billionaires don't have much of that left, and they want to protect their version of money at least until they're gone. There's also a subconscious hostility to anything that will out live them. In a sense they feel betrayed by life and it's offshoots (bitcoin) since you can't buy more of it. (Fixed supply of life/bitcoin that can't be created out of thin air, like their money can).

there are two parts to this. gaining access to the trezor account(s) and gaining access to the coinbase account.
for the trezor, plug it in to the computer. then navigate to trezor.io with your web browser. then click the "wallet" tab at the top right corner.
a screen should pop up that looks like a 3X3 array of nine numbers.
enter in the access code by clicking on the box number one after the other. this code should be 9 or less numbers. (note: the 3X3 array of numbers will rearrange each time you enter a number, this is normal). hit the enter button once you have entered the code.
the wallet should then load and reveal/give you access to your husbands bitcoin.
you can then send and receive bitcoin.
as for the coinbase account, you'll need his login username/email and password, and possibly the two factor authentication code provided by his phone app (google authentication for android phones).
once you have access to his coinbase account, you can send the bitcoins from the trezor to coinbase to sell the bitcoins for cash or vice versa.

during peak hours consumers are charged 18 cents per kw hour. But off peak users are charged 8.7 cents per kw hour in Ontario.
We call this time of use pricing here. So buy for 8.7, and sell for 15 maybe even 18 since governments love to give incentives for these kind of programs. You're basically covering the cost of your fuel by doing this....
It would mean that your battery life would be cut in half though since your likely doubling the number of charges up and down stream. 
So the question is, would free fueling be worth cutting your battery life in half? it may be. thing is, no one knows yet, but the ideas out there waiting for someone to implement it once the ecosystem allows.
You could easily market this as free fuel for your Tesla or smart car.

creating a new copay wallet requires you to create a new set of keys (private and public). try setting up a copay wallet first, and it will show which is which.
Once you set this new wallet up, you can send bitcoin from the blockchain wallet to the public key of your copay wallet. the funds are now possessed by the copay keys.
On your 2nd question, its difficult to say. If you're asking if the NSA knows, they could probably figure it out. But our tax office likely won't. If you are really paranoid you can always wash the coins through a truly anonymous coin called monero (complicated requires homework), or one of bitcoins tumbling services (more homework).
But at this stage, no is coming after you for three hundred dollars.

Hi fellow Canadian,
transactions fees are minimal, (maximum five cents). just make sure you include a medium sized transaction fee (more then 3 cents) so that your transaction is confirmed in a reasonable amount of time. (sometimes they even pay the transaction fee for you)
As for transferring your funds to cold storage, you should still be able to do that as long as you set up the cold wallet correctly and send the funds to the cold wallet address. play with this first before sending everything! but yes, the keys are kind of locked in with blockchain, so sending your bitcoin to another set of keys is advised.
as for copay, I haven't used them before, but if they require your name, then they are kinda no different from blockchain, sounds like a hot wallet still. EDIT: never mind, they look good! open source and multi sig is better then a hot wallet for sure. its still not technically cold storage, but its defiantly moderately secure to use multi signatures to secure your bitcoin. I used to use the same method before I bought a hardware wallet called trezor. you shouldn't have to provide a name to download their wallet. and if you are, lie. it's best to not have your name attached to bitcoin if you can avoid it.

Hi Cammie,
some obvious things to look for when it comes to bitcoin include hardware devices like the following:
you will also want to keep an eye our for pieces of paper with [QR codes](
or paper with what looks like random words on it (either 12 words, 13 words, 24 words or sometimes even 25)
something like: 
branch forest aardvark trend former long send holy letter bent empathy tomorrow 
Note: KEEP THESE WORDS AND QR CODES SECRET, DO NOT REVEAL.
Those are some obvious things to keep an eye out for. 
Some other things he may have done include online exchanges/wallets//website services. these are often country specific (in America coinbase is very popular).
Furthermore, if your husband has an android phone he may have a left a clue there in a app called google authenticator. This app is used for logging into accounts like coinbase. often the name of the account is located in this app. (i believe the iphone also has an authentication app but goes by a different name).
Once you find what you believe is the storage unit of your husbands bitcoin then you can move onto the next step, trying to access them. but first you need to find out where they are located, ie on a physical hardware device, written on a piece of paper as a 12 word seed/QR code, or housed somewhere online through a exchange wallet service.
another good question to ask yourself. where would your husband store/hide a piece of paper with untold wealth on it? in a safe? in a locked cabinet? in a hiding place? safety deposit box?

nice! I forgot that the 14 version is much faster now for syncing, good to hear!

I don't really see this as an issue as long as you make multiple copies of the file and store them in secure offline places among other images. It's basically a .dat file, without screaming that it is one.

download bitcoin core wallet, make sure you have enough storage on your computer. it will need to sync with the network/download the entire blockchain, this could take a day or two.
you can import the wallet.dat file into bitcoin core while it is syncing and view your balance. you will only be able to spend/send the bitcoin once the wallet is fully synced.
