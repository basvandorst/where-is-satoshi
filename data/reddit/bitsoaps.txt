How about some soap from bitsoaps.com ;)
Also maybe carry some of the items made by btctrinkets.com. They have established trust in the Bitcoin community for a long time now.

We are pointing out the obvious, however, reporting bitcoin sales may help instill confidence in other vendors throwing around the idea to accept bitcoin. We aren't Overstock, but every bit helps.   
Going in, we were expecting a 50/50 ratio.

Do you mostly drop ship your items or keep products on hand?

I guess since people know the merchant is saving money with btc, people naturally want a piece of the pie.
If the merchant found a new supplier that offers a better margin, and people didn't know, people couldn't ask for that discount! -_^
*I understand your points, and as a consumer I would agree at first glance. Since doing small business myself, I'm replying from the other side of the spectrum.

You are right, you don't have to pay to use your credit card, and you did have to pay for your bitcoin... then why are you even holding bitcoins? Maybe you are just buying and holding to make a quick buck on speculation? If everyone had this mentality, the wave of merchant adoption would be impossible.  
Since we all want this to succeed, maybe it's backwards logic to expect a discount for using BTC. Tokyo Pen Shop took the plunge when many others brush bitcoin off, so shouldn't they be rewarded with an extra couple percent? We need the mom and pop shops, and a better bottom line means a world of difference to them. 
By spending your bitcoins on a small item such as a pencil is also showing your support for the cause. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 10:08:37
This is true. Depends on how/when the buyer got heir btc. For early adopters, or even people who made positive % on their stash, buying anything already feels like a discount!

Contact Piperwallet, they may have a solution for you. I saw a demo in person the other day, seems solid.

Great idea

No one can tell you specifically how safe it is, but make sure you are using 2FA to create an added layer of security. You can also print out paper wallets from blockchain.info that cannot be "hacked"

It has a hefty price tag, but one day when BTC explodes again, I will probably pick one up.
BTW, could you see  items in your store in the future?  just picked us up to offer our products in Finland. I would love to have a UK base. Goodluck with your business!

Thanks! Glad you liked them.

This issue recently happened to us through our web store. Our customer sent bitcoins to pay an invoice, transaction has multiple confirmations yet Bitpay is giving us an invalid transaction. 
Support tickets were sent to Bitpay and so far there has been no response. I'm sure it will eventually be addressed. We have shipped orders out anyway.
