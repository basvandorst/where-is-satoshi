u/aaronm7191 and u/ex_nihilo are correct.
During the big fall/correction recently I made a decision to sell instead of hodl through the dip because I felt we were due for a correction and took a chance.
The chance was good, I took about a 20% hit before pulling out, but I bought back in so low that I've more than doubled my overall standings since.
There's a play for every scenario, its just a matter of careful calculation, some intuition and luck.

you'd be surprised how many people make that mistake.
"This has gone up 10% in the last day? Better ride that train up!"
Next day:
"Oh no, this has gone down 15%, better cut my losses"

This is part of what is scary though. A few guys I work with just bought in hardcore and have doubled their initial investment.
Makes it look like the free money tree over here. If it does crash its because all these free money people are also just as easily scared.

Exactly. In this logic I've been "HODL"ing coins that have been aimed at utility.
I'm playing the trading game- but thats because I want to end up with this shit in hand when I'm rocking a debt card and buying groceries with it.
At the same time so many people have been coming to me asking about bitcoin, I'll have them make an account on an exchange or set up a wallet and sell it to them for cash in hand.
I have mixed feelings about this since more people want to buy in and raises its exposure, at the same time the sky high prices and roller coaster trading defeats any function as an actual currency and does exactly that- makes it looks like some crazy money machine they don't understand.

Whats the deal with that? I've had my coins since 2014 and haven't payed attention since then until recently.
Is there a new tax code going up and I've lucked out on secret riches?

define "they"
Really its up to the exchanges and whoever wants to accept whatever. If someones accepting or trading a shitcoin it will continue to exist.
