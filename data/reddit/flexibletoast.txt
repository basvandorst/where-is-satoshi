What are you talking about? The economy is flying way higher now than before 2008. The Dow Jones was around $14k before the crash, it's at $26k right now, nearly double. The NASDAQ was around $2.5k and is now $7.4, nearly triple. Both indexes are at an all time high. The NASDAQ recovered in two years, the Dow in three.

He also wanted to get rid of public schools and basically everything the government does. Full fledged libertarians are nutjobs. We know these ideas don't work, why try them again? There is a reason the government had to be involved with giving basic level of things like education and retirement, people suck at doing it themselves.

Why is it terrible? It's the after party. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:41:15
Lol, yeah they were "slaves."
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:26:59
Yeah, I've been planning on selling a portion ever since the new tax year to pay off my car. I didn't want to sell last year because I received a bonus check which puts me in a higher income bracket. So far this year there really hasn't been a great time to sell. I think the most I spent was 11k, so I haven't been under, I just have been as up as I want to be.
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:03:27
Lol, you had to go back an entire decade to find a loss. Kind of proves the point. If you're young you have 30+ years to build wealth. Yes, there will be down, but that actually helps you as you continue to buy and lower your dollar cost average. If you were buying 2008 was a great year for IRAs.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:50:35
They'll need a planar currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:21:51
Yeah, after 100k I start looking around at other cars. 100k is when they start to feel worn out to me and issues start to crop up. And it looks like I put more miles on my vehicle than the average. I think my perspective is skewed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:40:15
You're getting some serious life out of a car to buy every 10 years. Or maybe I just put a lot of miles on cars.
Edit: I'm thinking it's my miles. You guys are talking about an average somewhere around 12k a year when I've averaged 16.5k. I even put 10k on my motorcycle this year (probably reduced my miles for the year on my car though). If you guys are in the US, you might be missing out on some traveling. There is a lot to see and experience, go out and explore.

If they can't be spent, then where is their value coming from? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:42:11
Yeah, I've thrown some money at ethereum too. That seems like the strongest alt coin. The number of transactions it is doing is staggering.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:23:46
Only enough for emergencies. The rest should be invested. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:36:42
I haven't broke out into international stuff. Being in Illinois I've just had some fun around the Great Lakes this year. If you're on two wheel I HIGHLY recommend the "Tunnel of Trees" in Michigan. I'll definitely be going back next summer. I plan on venturing off west too.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:28:52
Emergency as in your transmission broke and you need it replaced. The shop doesn't want to wait for you to cover Bitcoin to Fiat. Just keep a couple thousand around.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:22:54
Right, but the average on the car is over a few years, the 10k on the bike is new. I bet the bike ate into the average on the car. I can't remember what the mileage was at the start of the year though. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:51:15
What about the people that had their seats devalued because of illegal activity?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:50:32
The motorcycle is new, so I'm sure I didn't drive 26k this year. While cars can last that long, they always feel worn out long before that. You can feel the steering getting loose, the suspension getting worn out, panels start to rattle, etc... Usually passed 100k I start looking around for another car. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:17:42
I appreciate the concern, but I was planning on encryption and using owncloud. So it would be encrypted and sitting on my own server. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:45:40
Sell high as it's crashing, then buy again. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:21:06
That's why you sell as it's crashing... Then buy as it slows or starts to go back up.
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:52:10
Thank you, that's a great explanation. Is there a wallet that saves to a local database that I can then encrypt and sync to multiple devices?
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:19:19
Are the apps saving your keys to something local that you can then replicate with Owncloud or Dropbox?
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:23:43
Thanks for the info. I've been kind of looking around and learning these things. I'm not completely unfamiliar with cryptography, I've been a sysad in the Air Force for about 7 years now. I was thinking there was going to be a local database to keep a copy of. 
Is there a cheap way of buying and placing the coin into the wallet? Right now just to try it out I bought about $500 worth a few weeks ago on Coinbase, was charged about $5 for a transaction fee. It appears there will also be a transaction fee to move the coin to the wallet (probably not totally necessary for only about $800 worth right now). Is there a cheaper more direct method, or is it common practice to get from a bank and then withdraw to the wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:27:34
I know the issue with the Bitcoin Cash and Coinbase, but is there another reason not to leave coin there?
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:21:37
That's why this isn't my main investment. Mutual funds is where the long term investing goes. Bitcoin is for fun.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:43:29
Solar City was an awful investment. The only redemption was Tesla buying them.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:18:58
If you don't have a bank that reimburses ATM transaction fees, I feel bad for you. It's time to find a new bank.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:18:28
Major landmarks can be. Look what happened after $5000. That was a great time to short. I bet it happens at $10,000.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:14:39
I didn't know where to go with my BTG and didn't really put any effort into finding out for only $36 that I have. Thanks for this post, I'll look into HitBTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:43:59
People are so stuck on hodl, they can't comprehend shorting.

None of the stuff I've worked on as a USAF sysadmin has been. I've seen Windows 2000-10, Windows Server 2000-2016, Solaris 8-10, NetApp (which did have its own kernel, but iirc switched to a stripped down BSD kernel), VMware, and RHEL. Nothing that really has its own OS outside of older versions of NetApp. Everything else is using Windows, Linux, or BSD derived OSes. Unless you're talking on missiles or something. Which I don't know, but would guess are closely related to Linux or even using a Linux kernel.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:02:49
Using something that has been proven to work for multiple decades, or write your own. Yeah, the choice is obvious.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:38:47
That can definitely get to the best of us.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:25:06
I think he meant in use, not available. It's an ambiguous sentence though.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:38:25
Most, but most computers are nipr and not mission requirements. Things like the weapon systems still run in older technology. Things that have to be absolutely stable or else it can cost lives. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:29:02
Without the replay protection isn't that also going to get rid of your BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:09:46
I think that's what nearly all of us were going to do. I don't think we would have got much though. Similar to the BTG fork.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:31:30
Yeah, I've come to realize this. It takes about a week for the deposit to finish. In just today BTC has grown 7.5%. Over the week I'm sure it has been even more. You miss out on all those gains to avoid the ~1.5% fee. Not a smart move.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:29:39
I planned on using Gdax. I have no idea if it will actually work, but I'm going to give it a try. I'll move my BTC to a private wallet before selling the B2X though.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:52:30
Long term I'm most bullish on etherium. I'm seeing a lot of new tech being produced on their blockchain. They seem to have more figured out. BTC may have been the original, but others have improved on it.
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:28:20
Why would "sell at loss" even be an option? It's only an unrealized loss until you actually sell. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:53:58
Yeah, I would say they fell at the GameCube and stumbled again at the Wii U. However the Wii and Switch were/are wildly successful.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:58:23
I would say BTC proved the blockchain, not just BTC's. Right now I think the real gem is the technology, not so much how it's being used in crypto currency. IBM stock is a good buy if you want to invest in blockchain without the volatility of crypto currency.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:06:18
No , but that's another good reason.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:18:30
It would be easier to say it's logarithmic. A huge growth at first that slows dramatically. Most projections I've seen of BTC growth have been logarithmic. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:05:53
For now at least. We will see how much of a correction there is after the splits.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:11:10
Depends on how much your time is worth. How much are you getting per hour doing the ad viewing vs how much are you making per hour at your normal job. Then you tell me which is most efficient.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:15:21
They can be a good long term investment. Eventually when you're past retirement age you'll have someone who can take care of you in your later years. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:19:14
I think you don't know about shorting. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:21:08
People are selling alt to get into BTC before the split. They want the free money. It will normalize again in the future.
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:44:10
Ah, okay. Guess I just didn't understand the slang.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:33:47
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:12:08
Yeah my recommendation is that you should always be maxing out your IRA as a baseline. ~$458/month isn't too bad if you're making decent money. I only buy Bitcoin with money I know I can afford to lose. It comes out of my spending money, not my savings.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:21:53
Yet that comment was 7 hours ago and it's already below $5200.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:16:55
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE IN ALL CAPS, BUT I AGREE. The value is definitely being boosted right now by the imminent split.
