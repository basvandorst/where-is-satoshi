Most people paid by bitcoin or bank transfer and have no way of doing this.  BFL is no longer accepting paypal to avoid this very issue.

Here's a thought, given BFL's general sketchiness and unwillingness to fill orders, but also their reluctance to issue refunds:
Do you think they're mining with customers' hardware?  I mean, I can't understand why they would ship to those of us who ordered in 2013 when there are still outstanding 2012 orders - seems to me it would make more sense / be more responsible to get those 2012 orders out as fast as possible to rehabilitate their image, rather than let people queue-jump just to hang on to a few thousand bucks.  If they're *intentionally* shipping slowly, though, because they're mining on that gear, it would explain it.
I have no evidence they're actually doing this, it just seems so weird that their queue has hardly moved but the few people who are doing credit card chargebacks are getting their hardware ASAP.

I'm not sure they're shipping to you - I believe they're issuing you a shipping notice as a way to delay the credit card charge-back.  After waiting several months and it becoming clear that BFL had neither the ability nor the wherewithal to ship miners people have paid for, I initiated a chargeback through Paypal a few days ago.  I've received conflicting e-mails since then - an e-mail from BFL saying that they've credited my account, and an e-mail from Paypal saying PP has received confirmation that BFL has shipped my order (but with no tracking number attached).
So either BFL made an error in saying they refunded my order, or they are lying to PayPal when they say they've filled my order.
Knowing BFL, it's the latter.  We'll see.
Oh forgot to mention that my Paypal account and credit card don't show a refund (yet).
