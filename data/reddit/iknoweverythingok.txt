Thank you so much! Im now one of those people! With the gold! I hope this helps in my hope to be the greatest penis artist there ever was.

They were drunk, which didnt help. These ATMs suck, I have come up with a far superior and faster system than all this palm scanning govt id crap, just trying to figure out how to get it to these ATM makers while also getting a buck.

They could have made it alot stronger without compromising much is all. We need more real ATMs and less gimmicky 'im just a touch screen computer running linux in a fancy metal housing' ATMs.

Pretty much everything listed there is at the top currently, even music still being sold on CD. Sure you can get mp3 now and alot do, but its still the top of its competitive genre. As are the rest ie bluray, amazon, facebook.... Infact you are completely wrong and I dont think you understand anything anyone is saying. He was talking about superior product outcomes that faced a weaker but heavily supported opponent. Why am I even bothering talking to you, probably wont even comprehend this right either.

5min if your lucky. To me, I really dont understand *why* btc kiosks are not a thing. Like western union. Surely someone glancing at rather than copying your ID, is preferable? And surely the whole transaction from saying hello to a cute money exchange girl to getting your btc in less than 2min is preferable to the awkward buggy touch screen that takes ages to suck in each $20 bill that you have to hang around and give your phone number to?

Fiat is inefficent, corrupt, and the value which it held is becoming smaller as innovations like btc come about. Money was only good, and was only powerful, because it was backed by gold. You were trading bonds of gold essentially. It was like trading gold, only not heavy or cumbersome. It hasnt been backed by anything of value for a long time, and its only because of how slowly this happened, that people are OK with it. However, something that IS finite, so has value that cant be inflated, is btc. Which, also allows the exhange of wealth. Humanity now has the technology to make banks obsolete like netflix did to blockbuster, in pretty much the same way. Fiat can be made obsolete just like anything else, and the fact it is so weak as a technology now, means its death will be much quicker than it would have been should this same event have occured in the past.

Because that btc atm companies atms suck. Cant remember the name but the wholenwait 20min to get verified, scanning ur palm, copying your govt ID, 5%+ commission... Common, thats fucking terrible.

Hah! Sorry but that further reinforces my opinion. 98kg? That is nothing. Hell most men can easily kick over another hundred kilo man even if the kickee was anticipating it(im talking just a strait lunge kick at that). You think 100kg, that is strait up and down, tall and slender, is going to stand up to 1 or 2 guys, a crowbar and some violence? Dont even need the crowbar probably.
And alluminium at that? The shit dont like to bend, it likes to break, making it even more vulnerable.
I happily volunteer to break the thing off the ground with nothing more than a 4ft crowbar and myself.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:15:36
Haha.. You call it desperate. Im barely invested in btc, its just fun to speculate, but the end of xp support is big. Bigger than you think. People already control botnets of huge size, these same people will literally hijack almost every xp computer running on the day support ends, and wity it, alot of stolen identity. Why do you think microsoft supported it this long? They are dreading the bad PR, thats why they are being so vocal about support ending.. So they can wipe there hands clean and say to everyone 'we've been telling you for years!'

0 day cracks. Basically support for xp ends.. Lots of hackers have without doubt have saved for a rainy day(the day xp stops being supported) a hack that cannot be patched out and will steal massive amounts of personal data. Btc being the preferred method of payment for fraudsters, this would help the btc economy.

Yes, weak. It looks too thin, unless its almost solid metal, which judging by the cost and how thin the base plate is, probably isn't the case.
@_date: 2014-05-08 01:29:25
I think bitcoin is a technology that can and is used for good.. But I would be lying to myself if I denied that it also is a very powerful tool for people with bad motives. It would be unwise for the govt to ignore it.
@_date: 2014-04-04 02:21:40
Seems weak. As in someone could destroy it with a few kicks.

This is not free bitcoin. This is a rebate in the fprm of bitcoin that doesnt even cover the joining fee of any of these sites.

How so? All of those inventions/formats/companies have gone through a massive war-like adoption phase involving a competitor that was clearly inferior but had really good marketing or support for what ever reasons aswell.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:40:26
Im not talking about embd xp. Im talking about the hundreds of millions of people right now, many of whom use said xp to do their banking and online shopping, are about to have all there computers breached and their personal data stolen. You talk about cc fraud lke its not a big thing. Even if there was only 1000 cc fraudsters relying on btc as laundering method, and each one of those guys laundered 100'000k, thats a a hundred million right there. And thats only a thousand people with 50-100 working cards each.

For something to replace another, in has to improve upon and be better. Now, fiat has many things that can be improved upon, where as bitcoin doesnt have nearly as many. Everything has a 2.0 or an improved version eventually, but what we generally deem as a good invention is one that helps. Rightnow, btc 2.0 would just be btc with 2.0 put on the end, so is not at all helpful, so for now cannot 'easily' replace btc. Fiat can and has been improved upon, and it helps people. Its called bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:27:23
Always has. To not include upcoming significant criminals events in a btc forecast would be inaccurate.
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:44:22
Yeah, I think your right. I just dont like that companies are equating 'virtual currency' with less physical security because its not 'real' but as an in store pos and in a secure environment yeah now that you mention it, would probably work great.
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:36:39
My main point is that this is yet another over-designed piece of crap bitcoin ATM, only where this one got it right, it fucked up on what regular fiat ATMs have had on lockdown for a long time, and importantly so - physical security of the ATM. This would be Ok in an office or white collar, secured premise... But thats it. Otherwise this is an easy $10'000k+ for someone to steal and further alienate bitcoin from the general public.

* Dude, how do you think you buy music? Like seriously, beyond itunes/internet.. So you think people just... Don't? Like, theres either mp3, radio, grandmas vinyls... Or silence? Pretty sure CD sales still outweigh mp3 sales.
* Oh again, with how the world revolves around you and your technological needs. You havnt used your bluray player? So? What? What does that mean? Are you asking for advice on *how* to use it? What has that got to do with the HDDVD vs BLURAY war? How does that relate to hddvd being obviously inferior taking so long to die to you not using your fucking bluray player? Or are you just bragging how you can afford to buy shit you dont use? 
* So? Anything can and will be replaced eventually. Bitcoin too. Facebook is worthy of mention because it too struggled for a while, even though it was definitely and still is, better than the messy myspace. It wont fail(and hasnt) nearly as easily as myspace because incase you havnt noticed, FB spends a lot on development and moving with the times, they learnt from myspace. Not to say fb wont fall, but it was and is a better product and company than myspace. Twitter is already so simplified that replacing it would be a lot harder.
The problem with you comparing fiat to IPv6 is one is not consistently being designed to be better. This is why fiat is not as strong as something like IP. Oh btw, VHS beat betamax, its not listed there as an inferior product. All of those things are the winners of their genre/race.

The biggest one yes. The *worst* one will be when the average thug realizes stealing btc(in real life, from other real people, with threats and violence and kidnap etc) far outweighes stealing fiat/can hide it easier and can move it easier.

I really cannot fathom why people keep bringing this up - nothing has a value greater than what someone is willing to trade/pay for. Bitcoin ultimately is just data and nothing more, but people, for whatever reason they choose, place a value on that data and pay. A delicious meal is worth close to nothing to a man whos just eaten.

How does bitcoin make more sense? Sorry, the concept of a bank, holding money, using that for loans with interest as income, while people get thier cut for leaving money in the bank, makes heaps of fucking sense. 
Bitcoin which is essentially a giant super computer that is controlled by unknown people, being used to do unknown things, which does not actually exist in physical form, or have a government or bank accountable for, makes for a very shady fucking investment.
Do any of he bitcoin people ever think about how they might be helping create biological weapons that are unimaginable? cause thats the kind of bad shit super computers can be used for.
