There seems to be general confusion over the nature of contention and consensus.
Consider a US presidential election. Before the election, things are very contentious. Generally about 50% of the country favors the Democrat and 50% favor the Republican. But then the election happens, and most of the 49% who voted for the loser quickly accept the new president as their legitimate president. The legitimacy of the new president is not contentious after they're elected, and it is this legitimacy that matters.
Similarly, when a fork is proposed, miners and users can either choose to accept it or not. Most of the bitcoin ecosystem will accept whatever becomes dominant as legitimate. Most users don't have strong feelings about one implementation or another, and even if they do have strong feelings, they'll still accept the dominant implementation as the legitimate bitcoin.
The key to legitimacy (in both a presidential election and in bitcoin) is not in achieving consensus ahead of time, but rather that most people have faith in the process. The exception in US politics was in Gore v Bush when voters questioned whether their votes were counted. Similarly, a hard fork that occurs without open debate and under the threat of DDOS attacks and censorship may produce questions of legitimacy.
