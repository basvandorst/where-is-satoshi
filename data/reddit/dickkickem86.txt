Yeah, this seems similar to the PGP comment as well, or at least they are both true. I kind of got excited by an idea that has been around for at least a decade (probably more).
As I mentioned on the other comment, I think originally (while tired and high honestly, cuz that's legal here) I thought "and then I could use it to send a small amount of BTC to timestamp it.
Later I realized that it didn't seem to timestamp anything really, as someone could copy the whole work, change the BTC address to one they've already used, and claim that one of their sends/burns prior to the original author was when they wrote it.
I think the reality was that I was trying to find a sneaky way of suggesting a donation by just using the BTC address as an identified.

true facts. I think my original intention was to also mention how it's a donation address as well. That way if someone who was actually good at writing (or whatever they create) they could make money from it through donations without also having to add a bitcoin address, though it's not like doing both those things would be difficult.
I originally had thought about how you could do something by transferring through some BTC to maybe make a timestamp, but I think that might be why someone suggested colored coins.
I don't know, it was a late night thought that I didn't think to revise, so yeah maybe I was being dumb and forgetting about how PGP has been around for so long so my idea isn't really anything new.
