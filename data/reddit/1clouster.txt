How about old, vs new. They are both digital.
The fact that private banks create the supply by pressing in new digits makes it a digital currency. If people want their digits as cash, cash is printed when needed. So cash becomes a representation of a digital number. Not the other way.

You do not invest by buy the prices up. You invest by letting people sell into your price for as low price as possible so you get 50,000 coins instead of 25,000 coins. For almost every sold coin someone buy it to sell it for a higher price.

This is probably a ok to very good time to buy. 
Why? 
Because it will probably go much higher than this in the future.
If you invest for longterm and by that think its ok that it might drops a little more before stabilizing and than going up. 
You might also sit on the sidelines waiting for it to drop more as people did after the crash from 266, people expected it to go very low, it never happened. 
Same situation here, it might never go much lower than this.
Anything below 400 should be a buy.
Thus you might want to spend half now and wait with the other half to see if it drops more, than buy more with the other half. 
That would cost average you coins to a lower price. If a lower price happens. If it do not happen you can get in.

Small deflation do not make unemployment go up. The unemployment in the 30´s and after the 2007 crash was both caused by inflation. Inflation building up bubbles that than crashed and than removed as much as almost 40% of the circulating money from the market in a deflation shock.
That caused great unemployment for several years and we are still seeing the effects.

Most accounts with interest do not count the real inflation, thus giving to little interest to really protect people from inflation.

That sounds like a good theory, but in reality have you ever met someone who say to themselves: Hey prices are increasing I better spend now?
No, not unless you are talking about Argentina.
From this you can come to the conclusion that the theory of yours might just be that. A theory, that do not work in reality and is simply a theory to sell the inflation is good argument.
When in fact lots items go down in price and are really deflationary, like tech, still people buy lots of those. 
There is no need to force people to go out shopping. They have to buy things anyway.
Low deflation affect peoples behavior just as a little inflation do not affects peoples behavior because people do not go around and daily think about it.

No they tend to always lag and rise after inflation, never before, so they play catch up. During this time inflation lowers the salary.

But most people in this world have not enough money to "invest" and if they "invest" the return is so small that the risk do not out weight the benefit. Thus they keep the money they have in their accounts and throughout their whole life is robbed from inflation.
And how much do investments generate business? Most investment is just pure gambling and speculation on the stockmarket, which do not increase employment and create zero new companies. 
There is also not a single person who will spend their money just because there is 2% inflation and it will be worth a tiny amount less tomorrow. You need to have a higher inflation to say that inflation drive people to spend. 


No they would not, because the rich want to increase their positions but if everyone had 2% deflation, they would not increase their relative wealth they would simply stay still.
In fact they would lose their relative wealth to those that do invest, as there is a constant competition in the market.
