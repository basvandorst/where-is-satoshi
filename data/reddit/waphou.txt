Bitcoin crash before and come back because it was still useful u can sent money for cheap, now you can't even use Bitcoin to sent like it use to anymore 30$ per transaction and slow as hell like this, may as well use Bank Wire. if you want to sent 1000$ to your brother on other country, Bitcoin will charge you Buy Fee,Sell Fee, sent Fee? 3 fee you have to go with to even cash out 1000$ or you can just pay around 35$ bank wire to anyone in the world and 35$ can be sent over 10k 50k if you want it will still 35$, if anything go wrong you can always ask the bank for your money back. in Bitcoin once it broadcast in the blockchain it over, your fate will left with the Minner if they want to include it with their block.

 very small amount of people actually use it for service majority of the time it use for speculate, in hope of someone will buy it at the higher price. they will feed you with BS story. oh hey Segiwit + Lighting will boost the price, OH HEY Future will Boost the price, now HEY ETF will Moon. lol the problem with Hype is unstable. i had many chances to buy Bitcoin when it was around penny, 30$ and 100$ but choose not to, because i can't figure how to use wallet and secret key, and question my self why we even need it when we have paypal, and still hate my self for it til this day. lol i kinda wish i was believe in Unicorn, alot of unicorn become millionaire. we are just in it for greed. do i believe Bitcoin will have another run up? chance are just put in what you can afford to lose.

this is the next evolution Technology that using Blockchain store in public ledger and record all the chocolate you can eat and with the speed of lightning network to instantly confirm with zero Fee. there will be only 100 of this chocolate. lol just a laugh for ya, Deflation will never work in real economy,because no one will spend their money, Business will collapses and you will never going to have a job. =] you welcome. the reason why the Fed try to keep on 2% inflation is to encourage people spend money, which will create more jobs for real economy. the stock market crash is a way to try deflation the dollars.

sound just like most of the people here who hold any cryptos as well, buy the future lol so don't mock at him it maybe your turn. all the fan boy will hate me when they dream about Bitcoin is the future of currency,if you here to trade make few bucks i understand but if you think this shit will be the future, you are Delusional. High Fee,Slow as fuck,Fee to purchase off exchange. so you end up buying a 10$ worth of Item you will have to pay Triple before you can use it. Fee to purchase Bitcoin,Fee to sent and the Fee of items. don't fucking tell me about promise Bull shit. i spend this fucking Bitcoin and im starting to Tired of the fucking 1+ hour confirm and High transaction Fee. i believe i spend more Bitcoin transaction than any of you who try to talk shit that i don't know about Bitcoin.i like Bitcoin it use to be really Cool and cheap to use now the fucking speculators come here and fuck it all up.and they don't even spend it,they trade it and claim that Bitcoin is the future.

Bitcoin dominated will never return to where it once was, instead of keep pumping a 10k coins to double your money you have to pump to 20k no one got time for that instead there altscoin out there works faster and cheaper chance to turn your profit to 10x 100x 1000x is still better range than to mess with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:40:52
some of you maybe get use to the cycle and think it normal,but what i try to tell you maybe this time it going to crash if that ever come across your mine,common people can't push price, aka whale you call it maybe have a millions or so can move few, but the real deal is the Hedge fund are the one behind all this price pump. if they decide to cash out and leave bitcoin to die,it can happen any time they want. they got 500 millions or 300 millions to invest and withdraw that will make the price move.again when the risk is too high for them they tend to sell it while it go up,but once it reach what their price target they cash out along way up, and no longer invest into Bitcoin. that when the scary part come to play. some of you have zero experience in trading even you think you make some money out of a bubble and you think you know it all. all i can tell you is invest what you can afford to lose. have fun.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:15:17
Bitcoin can't do thing like ETH do or NEO even the ETH can't beat Bitcoin by 1 on 1 but just wake some of you up if altscoin already beat Bitcoin dominated below 40% compare to back then 98% to see Bitcoin return to even 70% you gota pull ETH price down under 300$ and Litecoin back to 30$. Tell me when that happen.

the price of Bitcoin don't need anyone, because it's got Bitfinex and unlimit USDT that will Buy what ever price you list. you can buy everything with Free USDT unlimit supply even china ban ico korean ban ico. even USDT only have around 44 millions in their bank reserve.oh don't forget the Low trading volume, let push this price to 1 million $ per coin. come join the ride. that what that whale doing right now. in countries like China,korea,india and many more countries around the world don't have 4500$ to play around, average american can't even save 1000$ a month. most of them live pay check to pay check. they hold alot of Bitcoin and when price is push to the sky them guy can walk out as a billionaire when they dump Bitcoin on your face. party start 8 year ago if you think you got bitcoin at price discount right now you are already late to the party.it can't be a currency when many of you just buy and hold and wait for next guy willing to pay higher price than when you bought. it call speculation market.

Go to tether website and look under Legal read it at line 3 this what it say.
"However, Tethers are not money and are not monetary instruments. They are also not stored value or currency.

Tether is bitfinex sister company.

Not from China, just invest with what u can afford to lose. I been to dot com and the housing bubble,they all end the same and always have those refuse to accept the fact, you can try to go around people you know and ask them if they want to buy 1 bitcoin for 100$  for those who have no knowledge about crypto will more than likely say no. If they say no for 100$ do you really think they willing to pay 4500 for 1?  Alot of exchange or trader follow price of coinmarketcap or worldcoinindex so if 1 exchange with volume like bitfinex pump the price will go up and you can blame many crypto traders are bunch of FOMO.

You guys are brainwashed,BTC price go up to this far because of FREE USDT bitfinex keep push price up and prevent it from falling many time. Look at the volume back when bitcoin was at 500 and 900$ it was at over 6 billions volume,now it hang around 800 and 600 millions. If bitcoin really grow why volume drop? USDT have 44 millions in banks reverse and they pair with BTC have over 74 billions value dont take a smart person to figure out this is not add up.this volume was before china ban too,really they dont need china the Usa or Japan or anyone when u got free unlimited supply of MONEY to buy everything you dont need anyone. KOREAN BAN Ico FUCK THEM they push it from 4000 to 4300 make 2000 BTC buy wall.

im just try to show the fact to people who are delusion,they dont' do home work that other countries are Third world countries. i travel to those countries, people don't make as much money as the average American. one of those countries average workers make 165$ a month, and majority of them are unemployed.
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:40:03
im sitting here looking at the alts and wonder should i buy in, or its just too good to be true. i know some sell to buy Bitcoin for a free fork coin but it doesn't make any sense for NEO to drop to 30$ lol i don't know it kinda funny when them guy try to tell you cryptos is expand,how can you expand when someone sell alts to pump BTC and it effect their price,if it's a large adaption it shoudn't impact the price at all. Volume is the only one speaking the truth here. i don't trust pump boyz or cheerleader cause they hold Bitcoin until you speak some common sense then i'll listen. btw i do understand about those sub at the same time i try to point out why China doesn't matter because Bitfinex and USDT. if you don't read my other posted early.

dude i meet them people who work at garment factory, they ain't no bot. they use to work at the rice field hot as fuck and they hardly have any money, they eat from what they farm. 165$ for them is alot for them. maybe ain't much for you. that the reason why i try to tell you we betting on a price of Bitcoin way a head of us, and the pump article talking about this shit will go global which it can in one point but i don't think it will happen anytime soon, this is just the same pattern like the Tech bubble in the 90's. as soon the ICO and all those project they promise to make and they can't make them as they promise im sure that when it pop.

The rich are smart with their money,they also not dumb to put everything in Bitcoin,and if they are really rich im 100% sure enough they ain't buy bitcoin at this price. Those people invest the most is 10% or 15% in a very strong stock.dont confuse day traders with the wealthy folks.

Bitcoin ATM withdraw Fee is not cheap as well, so you going to pay the miners fee if you put too low they will left there 2 or 3 days or sometime weeks. so now you end up paying the Fee to buy Bitcoin,The Miners Fee and the Withdraw Fee from ATM. if you use Exchange most of them charge .025% but you still not going to dodge the Fee of buy bitcoin and Fee to sent. that is not include the price bitcoin volatility while you sent.

50$ can buy about 5 months worth of to go phone service, i don't now if they really want to spend 50$ on Bitcoin and on top of that 50$ on bitcoin even price go up or down don't effect much at current price. many of them will choose to hold fiat when you can buy many thing physically, just want to point out life in countries like Asia tend to do thing face to face instead of online. unlike in America you have to drive 30 mins to 1 hour to places, alot of them will do business around their neighborhood.

He got lucky on the Eth train,they got in early when eth around 75 cents, at what price you got in? That guy smart enough to cash some out already.i dont know what u try to tell me?and he raised fund he not use his money to go for his own exchange. That tell you alot.

I would rather own 75 shares of Amazon or Google instead of spend 75000 on 1 bitcoin.you sir are delusional.people here make it sound like 1 bitcoin worth 2k is a bargain, sound like tulip to me and you can have them coins.
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:11:10
still got 2 weeks to go and it already starting to fall below 2k,everyone know buy deep is the best but 2 weeks to go ,i feel like 2k is just the beginning entry of falling, during 2013 it fall 50% meaning safe to buy is at 1000$ or 1500$ 
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:17:42
it very good choice that you choose to cash out at 1900$, loss profit happen on every trade. i feel like this is just a dead cat bounce. i also quit cryptos as well, i took few profit with me thou, cryptos will never survived without new Money. cause everyone buy cryptos to hoping to sell it back at higher price, which it doesn't back by anything or produce any goods compare to company's stock.it's all pure speculators,they buy them at cheapers price, pump it with Positive Article and dump it. and come out with negative Article to make the price drop buy back up. the loser is the one who Buy into it, when the one who have bigger chips control the price when it go up or down. very unstable to invest in this junk fit very well for gambling Addict. keep tell you to buy so they can cash out with profit left you with a over price coins. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:38:20
when everyone tell you to BUY now you better watch out, cause they will want you to replace their place once they price go up enough they will dump that red on you lol. before August 1st i don't trust anyone and i don't trust any Wave either,it's all pump and dump.

He sound like a gambler with addiction problem and tell everyone you dont have gambling problem. And always hope one day you can win it all back with just 1 good run.he be like as long i got a hold on bitcoin i will make profit, that sound like Tulip and Dot com. All will fuck u up with no lube.
