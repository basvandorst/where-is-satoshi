Sirsco.com is affordable, around $1k for an MSB policy. They do a bunch of smaller Bitcoin traders.

Ah sorry man, thanks for letting me know too.

If we ever want to be taken seriously, we need to stop being delusional about the size of the crime problem Bitcoin faces. Bitcoin will go nowhere if we encourage rampant illegal activity.

1. I'm not sure, haven't done it myself yet. Try dropping by the Slack channels, I'm sure someone there knows.
2. That is yet to be determined, will change as more people demand LN use
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:49:10
Are you sure there are any funds remaining in the wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:36:17
I'll have to try this myself. I imagine it can, as it should be less intensive than running Core and I could run Core on a Pi3
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:43:39
It's not electrum, the files you have shown are consistent with a Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin-QT client. Guaranteed.
See my other comment for more info
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:46:28
Did you get this solved? You don't need to sync the whole wallet, you can export or sweep the private key from the Core client to a new wallet.

I think though some basic users might like the familiarity of using an .msi installer, and it would need a restart again after running npm install.

Exactly. Wouldn't recommend using any significant funds testing

About 200MB for LN stuff itself, another 3GB because of Microsoft C++ build tools :/ maybe someone knows an alternative. 
Not sure on bandwidth CPU or memory but will check
Edit: About 1 GB total of RAM, 400 MB from electron.exe, 100 MB lnd.exe, 500 MB node.exe
CPU is 15% on a Intel  i7-5500U CPU @ 2.40GHz, dual core, 4 threads
Unsure on bandwidth still, but seems low.

Hope the best for him and that anyone who has info that could help steps forward. Got to protect our own!
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:39:30
Download the official bitcoin core client from bitcoin.org and it can read the wallet.dat file. No need to sync the blockchain. Can export the WIF private key, or sweep the WIF key to the wallet of your choice. PM me if you want more help. Be very cautious man if anyone asks you to do anything. 
Bitcoin.org is safe. Coinomi makes wallet sweeping easy. Then you can send the BTC to your preferred wallet.

What do you find clunky? It's just a 3 step process. Click "Launch Quick Buy" to start it.
Type the amount of USD or BTC you want to buy.
Then select a bank near you or the credit union option if you have a credit union near you.
Place the order, and you will receive the deposit details.
Just go to the bank, deposit the cash, upload the receipt to BitQuick, and you have your Bitcoins.
Tutorial video too if needed: 
To summarize:
1. Place order
2. Deposit cash
3. Receive BTC
Takes as fast as 10 minutes, but never longer than 3 hours.

You use cash deposit into the seller's bank account as opposed to physically giving the person cash. It's just as secure, but now you don't have to live near the seller. You only need to live near a local branch of the sellers bank.

It is a portal to launder stolen gift certificates for Bitcoin, yes?
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:10:10
I'm not talking about the fees. I'm asking how fraud is prevented in this system.
The only way someone would be willing to receive Bitcoins 20% below market value is if they were paying with a stolen credit card.
Meaning that if you are using Purse.io to spend Bitcoin, and you get a significant discount, it was because the other party was using a stolen credit card.
It's a very simple, disgusting model.

Credit cards are inherently dangerous due to chargebacks.
The easiest, quickest, and most safe way to buy Bitcoins is 
Three steps: 1. Place hold 2. Pay via cash deposit 3. Receive coins
Takes as soon as 10 minutes but never longer than 3 hours.
Good in USA, EU, India and Taiwan.

Bitcoin is a decentralized, open-source program and more notably a digital currency that for the first time in history allows anyone from around the globe to send any amount of money to each other instantly, without a fee, and most importantly, without a third party intermediary like a bank or PayPal. As long as you have access to the internet, you have complete and total control over your money.
Short and simple, keeps the technical crap out. Relatable to anyone.

While you are correct, they are still technicalities. A transaction can be sent without a fee and take some time to get picked up into a block. Still, transactions are instantly accepted into the network and if they are sent from a trusted source, there is no reason to assume a double spend, especially for small-time retail purchases.

Coinbase has fuckin 25 million in funding by the way. COINBASE IS USA?
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:58:26
No point in getting technical during the pitch. You can still have a transaction without a fee sent relatively quickly compared to the banking system. The fee can be reduced in the future due to Bitcoin's open source nature.


Acquiring any FIAT currency that isn't your own will require a 3rd party service, or a peer-to-peer transaction.
@_date: 2014-09-01 14:44:44
The take home here is when evangelizing Bitcoin, you need to connect with people.
"Do you believe in a globally connected digital economy? Well then here's the next big thing for you!"
versus 
"Do you want to send money for $0.05, instantly, anywhere around the world without a third party intermediary?"
Both messages are good, but I think the first message appeals to the masses whereas the second message requires some basic knowledge on the current state of money transfer (they have to understand you can't do those things already) 
Always keep in mind the average internet user has the education of a 4th grader.

I watched it. His argument is nothing special.
He's playing Mr. Psychologist. He thinks we're all circlejerkers but fails to make technical arguments against Bitcoin.
His alternative is alternative cryptocurrencies that follow real resources. Which is ridiculously complex and impracticable.

tl;dr, this guy is a fucking donk.

@_date: 2014-03-13 18:40:12
Agreed on this. Although I understand Coinbase because Coinbase is competition in wallet service. 
But BitQuick.co is the only exchange that even provides [proof of reserves]( doesn't get much better than that.

You notice how everyone is telling you to be careful on localbitcoins and trade with someone with a high rating?  That's because LocalBitcoins is inherently dangerous. Buyers and sellers can set their own terms!
If you don't want the risk of being scammed by a local and want a *guarantee* on every transaction to be processed within 3 hours, then go to 
Its more streamlined, and safer for both buyers and sellers but it is still peer to peer.
Edit: come on people, lets not be so defensive.  I'm not saying localbitcoins sucks, but it is obvious it can be improved in certain aspects.

This is the correct way to brainwallet.
Basically just make sure your brainwallet passphrase is actually an already custom hashed passphrase in which you only know the salt for.
Edit: anyone want to actually explain the flaw? Seems like most people regurgitating that they heard brainwallet is dangerous but don't understand why and how this is a very viable solution.

I'd actually say this is the best/most accurate representation of Bitcoin in the public eye yet on a TV show.
They address how Bitcoin isn't actually anonymous, and even put a rudimentary representation of a multisig address. 
The price represented was ~$500 or so so that wasn't too bad either.

Forgot BitQuick.co! 
@_date: 2015-01-12 07:44:31
Clearly a ploy to pump the price.
Now considering there is like a 95% premine or whatever, they may be able to pay back user funds by dumping premined coins. So it'll be a series of pump and dumps with the dumps being bigger than the pumps. I think the point is they're trying to "cash in" premined coins by creating buy pressure for a long period of time. Whether $5, $2 or even $1, if they can create high volume, they can actually cash out on their artificially high market cap. The re-purchase program will also reduce sell pressure, until they decide to sell the coins themselves.
What a shitfest scam. It's kind of smart for Josh. Create coin with massive premine.. Convince anyone to buy it.. profit.
@_date: 2015-01-12 08:06:05
Actually, it's kind of worse. Remember that 97% of the coin is premined. I said on another thread:
GAW might be able to do it for awhile by selling premined XPY on exchanges to pay back deposited interest. With a 95% premine, they have huge leverage.
There is only roughly $1 million of PayCoin floating on the free market at most. They own the other $47 milllion worth. This means they could guarantee to pay above market price for any of the free floating PayCoin by dumping some of their $47 million at significantly below market rate.
On the surface, it will look like the scam is working because users may actually get paid for some amount of time, especially considering not all XPY will be deposited.
Can't this be considered some kinda weird new ponzi scheme? This dude should be arrested..

Wow.. that sucks
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:19:48
Hmm.. to go 1 step further.. If you have 46/51 WIF private key characters (aka you are only missing 5), isn't there only 1 corresponding private key? Thus, you don't even need to brute force?
For example, if the target private key is 5HypXAJCYpmdgyM5V9bXT2KDPtrje16tGFRRng6iBhqygs3cZXK, the corresponding private key is the exact same for 5HypXAJCYpmdgyM5V9bXT2KDPtrje16tGFRRng6iBhqygs**XXXXX**, it's just the checksum fails for the second one.
But if you decode both Base58, and remove the last 8 characters, the private keys are the exact same... so OP doesn't even need to brute force, am I right?
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:00:10
Hmm, how does the last 4 bytes being a checksum help in the recovery of a partial WIF key though?
(Funny enough, I just received your book in the mail yesterday myself!)
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:42:03
As in you can skip checking the private key balances for those with invalid checksums? 
So the approach for OP should be to generate all the possible private key combos, and only check the ones with valid checksums? 
As far as I understand the partial WIF key cannot be resolved to a partial unencoded private key.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:59:04
Hmm, I've noticed that when I put a WIF private key into  no matter what the last 5 digits are, the corresponding private key output is the same (except for different checksum for last 8 chars/4 bytes)
Does that imply the last 5 characters of a WIF key are only there to affect the checksum?
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:49:07
So it seems unavoidable that you'll have to at the very least generate all the combinations of private keys, but you can save on computation time by not investigating any further on private keys with invalid checksums.

I guess I want to know how they're technically not doing the selling.
I'd actually argue that "generally speaking" they aren't doing the selling.
But because they take full control of the BTC (they do not use multisig), and then forward the BTC to the end customer, I think they  are "technically speaking" the seller. Or perhaps not seller, but they are still involved in the financial transaction. I think they are (1) see below.

For example,
Consumer has land deed--&gt;Sends to Company X who does digital deed proofs--&gt;Company X holds the deed, but sends the hex of the file for BitProof to shove on the Blockchain.
Then Company X can go to Consumer and say "Hey! Your file has hex "whatever" and can be verified on the Blockchain"
OR a third party could upload a deed copy to Company X and Company X could instantly tell them if the deed is authentic or not?

It seems they also made some efforts to evade MSB reporting via technicalities and silly "tricks" but it doesn't really elaborate much more on that aspect.
edit: Actually after reading the full indictment here, you get the complete story.  
They literally took in over $1.8M from countries around the world, including Russia, using shell corp's for bank accounts and never attempted to register as an MSB. I mean.. dude.. it couldn't be more obvious that they ARE an MSB. I'm surprised they never thought to register.

The only value add the bitcoin blockchain adds is further decentralization.  And in many cases, the relatively extreme level of decentralization is unwarranted. And the trade off is if you want your blockchain to have protocol changes, with Bitcoin you need consensus from the devs and everyone else. Private chain just needs consensus from the few permissioned participants.

Yes but the benefit here is that the reversed transfer doesn't match their blockchain. 
Let's stop pretending private blockchains are useless. They are a level above the current infrastructure. 
And until sidechains are out there,  it's not possible to have your own protocol that is still secured by the bitcoin blockchain. You have colored coins or private chain as your options.
@_date: 2016-02-29 15:25:55

@_date: 2016-02-22 18:20:10
Lol ok smart guy. 
This is a terrible argument. Just because Core did work for awhile on Bitcoin, doesn't make them infallible.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist, or for that matter a Core developer, to realize we need a block size increase.
Core has the power to issue this easy simple tiny protocol change but for reasons that cannot fathomed simply refuse to.

You're assuming all blocks will be full in that scenario. That's why the actual Blockchain size will end up being less. The simulation accounts for transaction growing linearly, so blocks would not be 3.7Mb until demand reaches that level.

When the rate of transactions being made exceeds the rate of transactions being processed, the queue will increase infinitely. Just basic queue theory.
LN is not factored into the analysis, I'm simply extrapolating the # of on-chain transactions. How would LN affect the analysis? I'm in favor of Segwit, and love LN, but I don't think it would change any conclusions. This compromise is the most realistic way forward. Of course, Segwit by itself is the **best** solution, but the way the world works is sometimes you must compromise.

Right, so I would hope that more technical readers understand it is somewhat an issue of semantics. The wording could be more careful, certainly. You are technically correct, but it detracts from the overall message I think.
This analysis isn't meant to be taken as infallible fact, just a notch above back-of-a-napkin calculation. The spirit of the conclusion being that it won't be long until Bitcoin becomes a very unpleasant user experience (ever-increasingly higher fees). Anyhow, thanks.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:03:33
Not true, the buyer thinks the person depositing funds is the scammer. The scammer presents themselves as a legitimate customer.
Nothing the seller can do.
Ultimately it is the person on Judge Judy that lawfully deserves the loss. They bought bitcoins, money order, etc, whatever, to send to the scammer and thought it'd work out.
Here is another example: when you send a money order to Joe Bob for an iPhone on Craiglist, and he disappears, do you think Moneygram should be liable?

Another way to frame what you are saying: Agreeing to this compromise is harmless. It guarantees Segwit, and HF by definition cannot be guaranteed; however, agreeing *in spirit* brings us closer to a solution.

@_date: 2017-05-18 20:43:07
Technically BU would continue to function, albeit in a highly centralized manner. (which I am NOT a fan of)
Bitcoin under 1Mb blocks will literally not function after ~120 days or so. Unless individuals are willing to pay ever-increasing fees past $1+.
If I had to rank the solutions:
Segwit &gt; Segwit + 2MB HF &gt; 2MB HF &gt;&gt; BU &gt;&gt;&gt; 1MB today
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:49:38
So are you against Segwit without a block size decrease? Even Segwit requires an inherent compromise.

Had some integer overflow issues with 20 year simulation. Bitcoin won't work for 20 years under a 1Mb cap, so that's why it is N/A.
And of course I'm not trolling. Do you think I really went through all this effort, trying to gather objective data, just to be a troll? I may be wrong in things, but not intentionally. The last thing I want to do is "troll".
In any case, I appreciate you pointing that out. I think what happened was also some integer overflow issues. I imagine the 1Mb chain will be larger than the figure I provided. I still don't think it affects the conclusion though. Block size must be increased either by HF or Segwit imminently.
@_date: 2015-10-06 12:20:00
Fair, good points made here.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:05:54
I believe the whole point of a compromise is to be on both sides. Silbert is with BU and with Core. I fail to see the problem with this compromise. Obviously to reach some sort of solution, both parties need to agree.

where do they sell the bitcoin for 20% premium at? and why use that premium to sell gift cards when they could just keep doing arbitrage?? not sure this is correct.

Thank you for the feedback, great points! And thank you for the paper, I will read that. Great starting point.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:48:06
Yeah, I will edit that. Definitely was some sort of overflow issue in the analysis.
Doesn't change the conclusion though. 1Mb with no Segwit is not an option anyone is advocating for haha.
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:58:05
The reason we're having this debate in the first place is because individuals and businesses want fees to drop. Segwit allows them to drop via a blocksize increase and off-chain scaling solutions.

The matter of the fact is that UASF Segwit is a very low probability of occurring within 4 months.
Those who are against compromise due to principle alone are playing a dangerous game and hampering Bitcoin's ability to succeed. Especially Part of the reason I made this post is to make an objective contribution to the debate. The trolling from both sides is counter-productive (as evident by some of the comments in this thread)

lol setting up a full node can be a fun project: 
I set one up with a Raspberry Pi 3, and that was a cool learning experience: 
I assume you're being sarcastic, but in case you're being serious too , I hate to break it to you, but more nodes will not make a difference to this issue lol. Spin up a BIP148 node if you want to "voice" your support for Segwit though. Read luke-jr's post on the risks first though: 
@_date: 2015-10-15 16:55:58
Gotcha, so you eat the fee. I see the displayed rate is 220 EUR right now though. That makes your overall fee 2%. PayPal charges 3%, so that'd be a 1% loss for you guys. Are there any fees displayed after sign up?
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:39:59
It isn't a "backroom deal", Barry is simply communicating with people and coordinating a solution. Not all communications have to be in a Slack chat. 
Barry is being very transparent.
And I think we're getting at the same thing.. agreeing to a Segwit now HF later compromise is OK because the HF part might not even happen at all. But agreeing to it in spirit might be enough to actually allow Segwit to happen.
You and me both want Segwit to happen man. You have a voice in this community, and I really hope you might reconsider. Supporting Silbert's compromise simply increases the likelihood that Segwit will happen. By definition, nobody can guarantee the HF will happen. We both agree!
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:01:08
I think you did not read the article. I am the author. 
The article clearly states that I assume Barry's compromise is first a 3.7Mb increase, and then after 12 months it becomes 7.2Mb essentially.
Also your posting history is somewhat suspicious. You've been a redditor for 1 day, and the only thing you do is act like an irrational UASF supporter. I support UASF, but trolling is not helping anyone. I'm inclined to believe you are either some sort of paid poster (trying to make UASF supporters look uninformed), or you are incredibly uninformed and immature.

I already know what a hard fork is. You would be better suited explaining why you are against this compromise. The HF may or may not happen after 12 months. Segwit happens first.
HF have happened before, and they will happen again. HF itself is not reason to reject a certain proposal.
I'm not going to waste your time explaining what a hard fork is. [We both know what it is.](
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:11:42
Certainly. I guess I don't understand what you are arguing for. Do you agree that Segwit + 2 MB HF after 12 months is reasonable? LN would be enabled in this scenario.
Also "Segwit only" ends with ~1.4Tb blockchain because the current Bitcoin system hasn't been growing at 1Mb per block. It just recently began hitting 1Mb per block. Before then, blocks were far smaller than 1Mb since there were far fewer transactions.

Without the compromise, there is too much contention to get SW alone. The entire premise of my argument is I don't believe SW alone is an option. The option is compromise or bust. The two parties are in grid lock otherwise.
I consider BIP148 a partial bust because there will be a chain split, and Bitcoin's value will crash hard.

Try 
Sell your coins for cash deposited into your bank account. For example, if you have Chase bank, you fill out the form on bitquick.co/sell, then ANYONE in the US with a Chase near them can buy your bitcoin by going to their local branch and filling out a cash deposit with your banking info.

Why are you guys so anti-proactive?
This kid should go to the principal. His teacher is being a dumb shithead. At this middle school level, a lot of your teachers are young and prone to being emotional when grading their students and don't really care as much about strict and fair standards. Don't stand for that.
Students don't need to stand for this crap, especially smart ones. If you are right, get the recognition you deserve. There is nothing wrong with that.
Please follow up with your superiors at your school and update us OP! You can get your A. Trust me, I pulled that stuff when necessary. And it worked out. 
I don't care if I make a "scene" because asking to receive the A I should have rightfully deserved is not actually making a scene. People, especially young students susceptible to major peer pressure, are encouraged not to make a big deal out of stuff like this because who cares that much about school right? It's not *that* cool right? haha you'd be surprised but there is still a pretty big negative social stigma with caring too much about school these days shared among the students.

You don't have to be a techie to understand Bitcoin. Just smart.
Can we get a summary from anyone who made it at the 5:15pm one?
**edit**: I watched the 7:15 PM one. First the show gave a brief intro on Bitcoin and started off the segment with the question "What the hell is a Bitcoin?" Ron Paul said he doesnt understand the intrinsic value of Bitcoin himself but that it could help bring down the dollar directly. He was sure to phrase it as "Bitcoin can be an alternative if the dollar collapses" and *not* that Bitcoin will help bring down the dollar. He more or less didn't talk about Bitcoin and talked more about the potential collapse of the USD. Then the topic changed.
Overall, I'd say it was disappointing. Ron Paul definitely showed he still didn't take time to understand Bitcoin and/or is not very interested by the idea yet.

Other way around. Silkroad clearly nurtured Bitcoin to its status today. Bitcoin continued its growth past that of its silk road dependence.
Think of it like Bitcoin was Albert Einstein as an abandoned baby. Silkroad picked baby Bitcoin up from the side of the street, not knowing one day this baby would change the world!  Silkroad raised this baby, until it was an adult.  Then the police took Bitcoins parents away, but by then young Bitcoin had grown a strong resilient spirit and so he moved out and is now living on his own doing his own thing.

Liquidity in that amount is a bit tricky but you can do roughly $10,000 worth of trading daily on Coinbase or you can sell on BitQuick.co but that'd take awhile.
Also thinking of Bitcoin as a stock is useful solely in the fact that its price increases and decreases. That's the same as with any commodity though. Think of Bitcoin more like digital gold. It has a USD value that fluctuates and is traded on the open market.

Nah, it won't work I hate to tell you. Mt. Gox tells everyone to do that.
Just make sure you use 2 Factor Authentication from now on on ALL your accounts with Bitcoins in them. 
You're not alone brother, I had my Mt. Gox wallet hacked a few months back and I lost $2400. I learned, I tightened security, and I kept working hard to make that $$ back. The Bitcoin economy has lots of money to make in it! :)

No, absolutely. I hope to use my Bitcoin as a primary means of transaction. And then also be able to get paid in Bitcoin (well, if you're an entrepreneur you already can!) as well. I don't see the deflationary nature of the currency being an issue.
 But I don't want FIAT!

An interesting effect is anyone can manipulate volume.  I don't buy it. You can place a buy order, then sell into it and repeat as much as you want to fuck with volume statistics. Now that there is no fee, volume manipulation is free!

The Chinese government just told the Chinese banks to NOT fuck with Bitcoin. Not to fuck it up.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:07:33
Yes, it is just as safe. Still require that they write no refunds on the receipt though and that they send a photo of the receipt to you.
I'd recommend selling on  instead of LBC because you literally can't get scammed with them, no fee, no customer interaction and they have a seller's guarantee. 
LBC is archaic in comparison.
@_date: 2013-09-17 11:33:27
But then if they dont usa 2FA, they could get hacked. Its a terrible cycle. If you make bitcoin easier to get, people typically let them be easier to steal
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:57:25
You guys are too closed minded. Bitcoin can certainly be viewed as a competitor to PayPal, but a real businessman is going to see the potential to utilize Bitcoin either in the customer experience or to reduce the cost of transacting money.
The reason PayPal charges exuberant money transfer fees is because they also have to pay fees. Bitcoin can reduce fees on their backend allowin the savings to be passed on.
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:45:12

That's ~500 BTC just for clarification.
@_date: 2013-09-09 11:45:53
The issue is the payment methods. Use cash deposit like bitquick.co does. That is why they have no limits and allow the purchase of any number of bitcoin without chance of reversal
@_date: 2013-10-25 02:22:33
No. You buy the miner, you get it, you plug it in, you wait half a year until your investment pays off, then the miner makes a few  bucks a day until the difficulty is too high and your miner gets nothing.
Go buy a Bitcoin and read a thing or two about what you're doing before you're so eager to throw your money into something.

Umm I'm confident as fuck because speculators are the first people to raise the value of an asset to its true value before the adopters actually come in. Consider that.. Bubbles must come before adoption. There will be losers, the losers are those who sell.
More and more people are beginning to understand the simple math that there is only 21m BTC so if market cap gets so large, the price of each BTC is relatively easy to calculate. With that in mind, many know BTC is severely undervalued given the fact it essentially makes banks irrelevant.
@_date: 2013-09-21 17:59:36
Ohhh, this haha. Yeah, I remember when I was younger I coded a bot for a Liberty Reserve casino and it used this system to play.

Try bitquick.co, no problems.
@_date: 2013-09-01 21:11:33
Yessir. Its like BitInstant from the buyers perspective. Its even better because there are multiple sellers, so decentralizing the source of Bitcoins helps the longevity of BitQuick.co. the system is totally independent of FIAT services, aside from the various bank accounts the sellers use to sell their coins. BitInstants weakness is they needed to work with a payment processor. If that payment processor says they quit, all of BitInstsnt goes down. On BitQuick.co, if a sellers bank account is closed, there are still dozens more :)
I mean just the concept itself is genius for buyers and sellers. Im surprised something like this was not developed much sooner.
@_date: 2013-10-19 15:32:56
Nah, just look at the trends over the past few months. The fundamentals for Bitcoin are going to be bullish for a long time considering it holds the potential to replace todays entire economic infrastructure. A long shot, but the code is good enough. It's up to society to embrace it.
My philosophy is Bitcoin is going up to the $xx,xxx range, $x,xxx range NO DOUBT. The key is to make money from the daily swings still though. I don't just hold and wait.

@_date: 2013-10-21 14:14:53
Reference this post: 
The fundamentals of Bitcoin are much different than when the last bubble occurred.
The growth we are seeing is at least partially attributed to these changes in the fundamentals, meaning at least _some_ of this growth is organic, and overall, expect to see positive numbers for your 30day moving average for quite some time.

The buyer will need the sellers account name for this still.
Closest you can get is selling on bitquick.co. you could give a nickname out instead and receive cash deposits into your bank account. Thats what i do and its more safe because cash deposits cannot be reversed.  Bank transfers can be.

It's only a central platform. Of course the individual politicians would have their own unique platforms.
The point is to not have a party define the individual 100%. Thats the problem right now. 
If someone runs on the "Bitcoin Party" all you know is that politician has a great economic policy, I will research his others positions. And think about him. And not automatically tie him to Republican or Democratic ideals.
The current party system encourages lazy, uninformed voting based solely on the party affiliation of a member. It's stupid and we need to deviate away from it.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:33:19
I see. Well then prepare to sell right before the deadlines are missed.
That's how the alts work. "Oh, so and so shitcoin is having this and this done by this and this date" so there is a big price run up to that date. Then the day ends, and there is a huge drop off in the early morning hours.
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:03:42

Worst case scenario: Bitcoin all out fails for some crazy reason. If Bitcoin doesnt gain widespread adoption, it will die in a few years. But odds are good I'd say. 
IMO, 98% chance we breach $1000. 2% chance Bitcoin dies. There is no middle ground.

I think Bitcoin's inherent value is that it makes transfering FIAT easy. And in a single, universal, denomination.

Translating what you said: "I think Ron Paul is crazy and will hurt Bitcoin (which is also crazy but not as crazy)"
IMO, the amount of press Ron Paul would bring simply couldn't be negative press. 
Bitcoin is so incredibly new, almost any major press is good press whether positive or negative because it brings exposure. At this point, most Americans still have not heard the word Bitcoin yet. They're not even neutral on the topic yet because most don't know what it is.
**Also can you please actually elaborate on what Ron Paul said? It seems my criticism of your shitty summary did not provoke you to further explain.. Perhaps this will? You'd be doing all of us at r/bitcoin a great favor lol**

Badass? No. Coward. Its not so much the fact that he needed people killed (in that type of position he was in, you could easily justify killing someone in an ethical manner), but that he was stupid enough to ask someone over the internet to do it and he probably couldn't do it himself. 
Also the fact he wanted the first hit done because he was afraid his own dude would snitch shows he was more about covering his own ass than acting in an ethical manner. 
Tl; dr dpr was not mature enough as an indivudual for this job.

Bubble rapidly inflating. This is WAY too fast.
Sell on the overshoots, you'll get to buy back in later.
I expect the new plateau to be around ~$200/BTC, but I can see us hitting $300 in a flash pump n dump.

Pfft, I wouldve obviously forgotten!
Thanks for reminding me by replying to my comment!
@_date: 2013-10-19 12:24:06
Also note: THE AMERICANS ARE STILL ASLEEP. Once they wake up, they'll probably push the price to near $200 (i'd dump around there) then it will plateau around $190.
Maybe I'm blowin smoke out my ass, but so far I've had some good results ;)

@_date: 2013-10-16 23:59:15
That overview is correct. You don't provide any of your personal information at the bank.
If you don't want to put your trust in a vendor, you can also use BitQuick.co for cash deposits and they offer better rates.

Cash deposit at any bank. So youll have to wait until Monday. But otherwise, its cash in your pocket to Bitcoin in your wallet in under an hour ;) No matter how few or how many bitcoins you want to buy. 2% fee to buy, below Mt. Gox price.
@_date: 2013-10-03 11:45:22

If your bank accepts SEPA transfer, you could probably get rid of it pretty quick on bitquick.co
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:51:46
No problem. Well if you can wait 1-2 days that'll prolly work for you. And you'll fetch Gox rates.
@_date: 2013-09-01 22:27:17
Nonononononono! 100x no! Just as unsafe as ach transfer. Reversible.
If you have to, at least ask the buyer for a government issued id.

Anonymous, no registration, instant, no limits. All you need to provide is an email address and your receiving address.
As long as you are near a Wells Fargo, Chase or Bank of America, you can buy Bitcoin!

The reality of the situation is NOT that there are no predictions or theories to be made. There are plenty of different logical routes one could take to predict the price of BTC increasing or decreasing.
By this logic, we shouldn't invest in stocks either because technically nobody but insiders know what is going to happen..
Just because you can't know with 100% certainty, doesnt mean there is no point in answering a question..
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:12:04

Yo dawg just use bitquick.co.
No long steps. Place a hold, pay, receive bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:11:55
You walk to your local bank and pay via a cash deposit. You email the receipt to BitQuick.co, and get your Bitcoin in under an hour.
To buy, you don't have to give away any more information than a Bitcoin receiving address and an email address (optional)

Do you at least know what website you went to to buy these BTC? It was NOT Blockchain.info, guaranteed.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:19:24
If I understand correctly:
 tl;dr, Bitcoin is highly undervalued at the moment and the reasons David Yoo attributes Bitcoins current market value to are the exact reasons why it will become worth much more? (because it hasn't attained any of those goals)
Is it possible David Yoo is being misquoted? He can't be that dumb. Perhaps he is saying given its speculative nature at the *current time*, its max value is 13B and those other 3 things are things Bitcoin will later attain? And that is why he said it is a good investment?

Just click on their FAQ, it's literally as easy as 1 2 3.
 To buy you just place a hold on an order with a bank near you,  deposit cash into the sellers bank account by going to a local branch of their bank,  then emailing bitquick co your receipt as proof of payment. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:15:35
Seriously? No mention of BitQuick.co?
It's the QUICKEST way to get Bitcoin on the market. And you can sell on there very quickly.

So freakin cool! !

Bitquick.co once the banks open. Instant,  easy,  no registration, no limits
@_date: 2013-10-06 17:14:15
If you want to buy and sell Bitcoins instantly for cash deposit, I would recommend 
2% fee to buy, 0% fee to sell. Prices are inbetween Mt. Gox and BitStamp.
If you are looking for a _true_ exchange though for day trading purposes or whatever, I would recommend BitStamp or CampBX.
@_date: 2013-09-20 02:26:39
also is equality of outcome relative or absolute? im too lazy to read

Create new bitcoin address on brainwallet.org-----&gt; send to that address----&gt; send to btc-e (new accounts have to wait 3 days to withdraw!!)----&gt; buy litecoins----&gt; send litecoins to mcxnow----&gt; sell litecoins for your new freshly cleaned bitcoin! :)

Dayum, that bitch is aggressive. Bitcoin is the online equivalence of cash. Cold hard cash is more anonymous than Bitcoin really.
@_date: 2013-09-14 11:28:47
Anonymous cash bank deposit to various sellers. The volume on there wont allow you to buy all your coins in one day though itd take you some days.
On the bright side, this is anonymous.  No registrationbis required. You pay by walking to a local branch of the sellers bank (e.g. chase, wells fargo) and deposit cash directly in their account. Email the receipt the seller sends you to orders and receive your coins soon after that.
Also you need to stay under 10, 000 per deposit or the bank will need additional info from you for the IRS. Otherwise, youre 100% anonymous. All you need is a bitcoin address to place a buy hold, email can b fake
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:43:17
Speculators will bring the value of Bitcoin to its true value before it should be there because they're speculating.
The speculators are always first to land.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:35:34
Neither... they're just popular and fit into the business model.
It uses cash deposit. If your branch doesn't have locations for cash deposits to be done, then customers can't pay for your Bitcoin.

1. Many alt-coins had heavy premines by the developers
2. Speculation to pump price. Increased access to something of no inherent value..?
3. Cant change your ASIC to mine LTC. Different hash algos.
1. 1/4 as secure arguably per transaction.
2. API..? Like..an official Bitcoin API?
3. Cool.
Overall, I am guessing you bought some Litecoin recently and are regurgitating some facts you heard.

Definitely early bubble stages, if it is a bubble at all (I do not think so, I think it is organic growth). 
Last bubble went from $20 to $266 back down to $66, stabilizing at $100.
We've been hovering around $120 lets say before all this rallying happened. A bubble of equivalent proportions would blow up to $1600, crash down to $360 and stabilize around $600.
There's nothing weird about what is going on right now, especially considering the fact that the market cap for Bitcoin will probably inflate to at least a couple more billion dollars. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 13:41:16
Wow this sounds really cool! Good luck
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:35:42
Do we really need to upvote this..? Its a half assed scam attempt that only a complete dumb fuck would fall for. No shit you double check if you actually got the money before releasing the Bitcoin.

Ach takes 3-5 business days. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 17:09:43
Not a chance. The demand is enormous. People want BTC instantly. They don't want to wait 2-3 days for CoinBase or Dwolla to process an ACH transfer, or 3-5 days for BitStamp to process a damn wire transfer with $40 sending fee, or 5-7 days for a CampBX money order deposit.
Quick Bitcoins is where the demand is at and the supply is missing. You have  and bitcoin-brokers.org and a couple other smaller start ups filling that niche right now.
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:43:17
I wouldn't forget BitQuick.in, another Indian P2P exchange also unaffected. It's like a streamlined LocalBitcoins service.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:42:30
Why do you believe LTC should be 3-15% the value (in terms of market cap) to BTC?
We need to be talking in terms of market cap. Price doesn't matter as much.

Not to mention the price is below Gox

Did you even look at the blockchain?
You can clearly see OP lost his money somehow.

Protip: Post on their Facebook about support issues. Something about the public humiliation makes them respond to your ticket within 48 hours. Also threaten to report them to the BBB. Trust me guys, I tried this lol it works to get a response

If it catches on with the American youth, it's all over for the governments.
Once you have Bitcoin, it's too easy to stay in Bitcoin.
It hasn't become a fad yet, but once it spreads like Twitter did, it's going to be quite powerful.
Social media is a force of immense power this day in age.

Bitquick.co, you can buy btc with cash for 1% fee instantly and anonymously
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:00:52
Lol why they make the address begin with 3! It should be a 1. Of course there is the odd chance the dude is using them special escrow addys
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:13:02
Post on their Facebook page and get angry and threaten to report them to the BBB, your local PD, etc. etc.
Don't worry, we all know you aren't that crazy but it's the only thing that gets CampBX to reply to you.

@_date: 2013-12-11 23:54:31
Thats not unusual.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:35:43
SEPA transfer if you're in EU.
@_date: 2013-09-05 15:14:25
BitQuick.co is the easiest in terms of hassle. Deposit cold hard cash at a local bank, then receive your Bitcoin within a few hours. No reg required or limits.
If you want cheap coins, use CampBX or Coinbase but you'll have to wait a few days.
@_date: 2013-10-06 17:06:21
They better hurry up because  is quickly taking up that niche they left behind. Plus BitQuick has a decentralized seller base, making it less likely to be shut down.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:04:44
Lmao I fucking LOVE Sam Hyde.
People don't know he is actually bullish on Bitcoin haha. But let's be for real, we're so incredibly circlejerky over here, it makes satire too easy.

We are the market, so shit, we'll make it $190.

ohhhh myyy gooddddd lol. they really dont know anything about the topic.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:24:07
Should be tryin BitQuick.co
@_date: 2013-10-12 22:13:12
Yeah, they sell the coins for you. This is so buyers and BitQuick knows the seller has the bitcoin to sell.
I've used them to sell tens of BTC. Highly recommend.
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:07:32
I don't believe in Jesus, but for the sake of argument, lets assume your Jesus is real, it does sound like Bitcoin aligns with the "forces of good" for the most part.
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:41:56
Try selling on bitquick.co, you'll be able to fetch gox rates.
Edit: forgot to mention with bitquick, you'll receive cash in your bank instantly from buyers so its the fastest method right now.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:13:34
actually instant, no bullshit hoops. all you need is cash in your pocket and an email address. bitcoin wallet optional.
2% fee, market rates. pay with cash deposit at most local banks.
who the fuck uses virwox? you'll lose 10-15% of your money trying to do that crap.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:18:27
Not mine lol but yeah nobody is willing to sell right now..
I'm usually a seller on there too but Coinbase is all out.
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:48:10
Or make be an easy millionaire...?
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:05:22
ACH is slower than Coinbase. I really do love Coinbase for the fact that they do instill a certain amount of trust into their customers, and I know for a fact they lose a lot of money because of that. But it really makes the system convenient.
Thanks Coinbase!
@_date: 2013-10-21 18:57:08
You can't have everything your way man.
What you are asking for is ridiculous and impractical.
What about any of the websites just listed give you a reason to be suspicious? What it sounds like is you are very scared because you do not know anything about Bitcoin whatsoever. Educate yourself, then make educated decisions.
Living your life like a scaredy cat and expecting the US government to protect you from stupid decisions is the exact opposite thing that Bitcoin is promoting.
@_date: 2013-10-04 13:24:20
Bruh, look at the other threads.  The address containing the seized btc is easily visible on the blockchain. They have 27k all in one wallet. I'm on mobile so I'm not finding the thread but its recent

They have Canada too and are open to international sellers.
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:19:15
In 3 years, why the hell would I still be using Bitcoin at $200 a piece if I knew it wasn't going to gain widespread adoption?
The difference right now is there is hope. In the future, there will not be hope. Only answers.
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:58:25
I said it in another thread, they can't touch the P2P exchanges.  [BitQuick.in]( and [LocalBitcoins](
Decentralized exchanges. Easily shifting the power back to the people.
@_date: 2013-08-17 16:05:23
Doesnt change the fact that it takes one fucktillion hours to download the blockchain.

No questions, no hassle, instant, easy, anonymous

Its a fresh Bitcoin address that only started having activity after October 2nd. 
Why would the FBI move 27k BTC (proven to be previously harbored om the Silk Road) to a wallet they don't have the private key for? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:11:30
If the fake FUD drops the price.. BITCOIN SALE
@_date: 2013-10-19 12:16:29
Overall, market wants price to increase for sure. But there will be plenty of overshoots. Make your $$ on those. Like when Gox hit $195, that's an overshoot.
edit: sheesh, what's with the downvotes? My predictions are coming true.
@_date: 2013-09-22 18:14:49
Ahh then bitquick will only work if you have a bank for sepa transfer

Chill out. CampBX is notorius for crashing when there is any price movement lol piece of shit.
@_date: 2013-09-17 12:01:58
There is nothing like that for standard currency or even widely accepted FIAT services like PayPal.
You won't see it be built-in to browsers, but the next great Web Wallet is free game.
Shit, if I knew how to program extensions... It'd be simple really. The whole thing could use brainwallet to process shit behind the scenes.

Just volume. # of nodes in that location. Or connections. Something along those lines. The color doesnt really matter, its just to distinguish different numbers more easily. Probably a rainbow scale.

Youre dealing with virtual currency dude. Thats why they banned you. If any of your customers put bitcoin as the memo, there ya have it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:51:31
Was it cyberbullying or were they right? 
The correction was definitely big enough to smash some heads in, and many were calling for a correction to the $600 level precisely on the basis of that being where the exponential growth should take us before China took us into bubble mode.
Edit: ok, I see the haters you refer to are still continuing to try to spread panic. The correction was natural and bound to happen. Anyone actually panicking from this should abide my Warren Buffets rule: "panic when people are greedy, get greedy when people panic"
Unless Bitcoin dies within the next year, we're going to see $1000 again haha

If you can send SEPA transfer, BitQuick.co is anonymous and instant (although I think SEPA orders take 24-48 hours)
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:58:38
Yeah typically under 15 minutes
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:45:39
If you don't care how long it'll take, BitQuick.co

Then, BUY

Well that sort of gets back to the whole issue of party politics.
I guess it is too big of a longshot to ask the American people to shift away from the party philosophy, and think about politicians on a more individual basis.
Judging a politician solely based on the behavior of his constituents is stupid, and hampers any type of progress.
@_date: 2013-09-28 21:47:42

@_date: 2013-11-22 16:08:54
That is not why Bitcoin is successful you idiot. Currency works because someone arbitratily puts value into something.
Bitcoin is successful because its a protocol free of government corruption.
Hedging it to gold is not centralizing it..

Dude these exchanges are hosted in international jurisdictions. Even using a VPN is good enough. They would never waste their time looking into jack shit. Theyre all too busy. The only thing that would force them would be the US government,  and there isnt about to be a Bitcoin heist that the US govt is going to investigate along with cooperation of international jurisdictions. Only has happened once to Trendon Shavers where the US govt investigated him and he wasnt trying to hide either and no international cooperation was needed since it all happened in Texas.
Furthermore, bter, mcxnow, and btc-e require nothing more than a username and password to use their sites full features. They couldnt hunt you down even if they wanted to, they simply dont have enough of your Information.
Being caught this method is completely impractical.
@_date: 2013-10-25 13:29:17
duuuuuude such cheap coins on coinbase right now :(
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:38:07
There are people scrambling to sell to Coinbase.
If they sold to BitQuick, it'd work.
BitQuick isn't a service like Coinbase, it's more like an exchange. Buyers and sellers are needed.
You guys want more options but refuse to utilize the platforms. What gives?

Instant and anonymous
@_date: 2013-10-21 08:29:06
Could somehow be tied to the movement in BTCChina. It's at $177 /BTC now (1080 CNY)
BTCChina and BitStamp follow eachother so BitStamp will go up to $177 once the Americans wake up.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:01:45
Because a large number of people still define intrinsic value as being physical.  To those people, without a hedge, Bitcoin will NEVER have "intrinsic value".
Remeber, I'm going based on the haters definition of intrinsic value. I understand the bitcoin protocol has value itself.
I'm talking about connvincing people like Peter Schiff

Jesus christ, all you whinny cry babies call scam when shit doesn't work out for you because you're too stupid to actually learn how the website works. Do some research.
Coinbase is one of, if not the *most* legitimate Bitcoin trader in  the entire world. They stay under the scope of the U.S. regulatory regime. If they went scam, they'd be prosecuted. COMMON SENSE.

I'm a seller and there needs to be more liquidity. What's wrong with trying to get an exchange with a convenient platform more popular? Right now my only other options as a US citizen are LocalBitcoins, Coinbase (sold out), or sending a MO over to CampBX.
If you guys want more options, then you have to migrate to other platforms.

Remote Administration Tool would basically give the hacker virtual control of the machine. Doesn't need to know the private key.
All he needs to do is launch Bitcoin-QT, and send the BTC already loaded in the wallet.dat

Stick to P2P exchanges like BitQuick.in and Localbitcoins for any further trading. Much safer from a privacy aspect and legal aspect and the only exchanges left in India now.
Did you purchase coin from the raided Indian exchanges?

I haven't used it and dont really ppan to since cam girls are... um.. rather eh... but the business model looks good and bitcoin seems like a great payment method. 
@_date: 2013-09-11 22:37:40
 
Get em instantly today haha if the bank is open that is.
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:55:24
CampBX is poop
@_date: 2013-09-22 21:51:51
Competition and ignorance lol
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:08:29
Exactly. It's all about perspective. Mofo's need PATIENCE. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:09:02
~.0003 BTC.
Just a feel from someone who has done many Bitcoin transactions across different BTC services.
I'd say mostly your data consists of .0005 fees, .0001 fees and .001 fees.
@_date: 2013-09-20 14:23:23
Which bank and roughly how much activity? 
@_date: 2013-10-25 14:19:31
Oh yeah, how forceful to ask for a celebrity to look at Bitcoin. Celebrities _never_ endorse anything.
And we should let Bitcoin naturally grow guys! Don't spread the word, stay quiet! It will just grow _naturally_ if you let it be!
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:24:03
Still, a correction was healthy no doubt.
@_date: 2013-10-04 15:35:55
you look at all of DPR's carelessness, and you really still believe he had a good dead man's switch system put into place? lol
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:07:32
R u fuckin high
@_date: 2013-10-05 03:06:00
And the details on the receipt, how many of them seem to be real? (I.e. the branch name)
Thanks so much.
@_date: 2013-10-14 15:37:11
Dude that guy was fucking joking lol
@_date: 2013-09-22 17:59:22
Bitquick.co. anywhere in the usa
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:16:01
Oh whoopdeedoo, that'd be like if freakin Coinbase released Coinbasecoins and owned all of them. Or Blockchain.info released Blockcoin.
Just because you create a Bitcoin exchange, doesn't give you the right to rehash the Bitcoin algorithm and print out a freakin bajillion of them to call as your own. 
It doesn't get any more uncreative than Ripple.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:28:22
be nice.
@_date: 2013-09-19 03:07:44
Pfft, your website is lock down. Don't worry. For .3 BTC? That'd be a terrible reward for stealing a CC, getting a fake phone SMS verification somehow, etc. etc. haha
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:15:38
No.. You don't need a bank account to buy Bitcoins on BitQuick.co.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:41:32
You list your coins for sale (typically Mt. Gox price sells near instantly, if you want to fetch a high premium, it will take a day or so), buyers deposit the cash into your bank instantly. It's a super easy process.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:01:11
Yeah only downfall is right now their sellers have pretty high prices.
Otherwise, it's the quickest simplest way to buy bitcoin.
Just walk to the bank, deposit cash, send receipt to Bitquick, and you'll have your coins in like a half hour.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:04:11
haha the quicker you realized this, the more btc you bought.
@_date: 2013-10-17 08:40:56
Fuckin Gox is phishy as hell. 2FA, still getting scammed.
@_date: 2013-10-06 17:52:53
They give any updates as to the timeline of the project?
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:38:16
High school checkings account at Bank of America or JP Morgan Chase and sell your Bitcoin on BitQuick.co
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:50:04
I can tell the sentiment is bearish because usually people would be jizzing their pants to this news. DROP.
