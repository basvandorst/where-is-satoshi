Bitcoin by Miguel Rochefort works with coinbase and blockchain and integrates with the phone wallet. I've used it a few times with no problem (with a blockchain wallet). It doesn't support 2FA though, I created a loose change wallet specifically for phone use.

Holding bitcoin isn't an investment, it's speculation - you're betting on them being worth more later than they are now, but there's also a risk they could be worth 0.Why not buy something with then and help to grow the ecosystem by actually using them?If it does all implode you've had something from them, and if it goes 'to da moon' you'll still have enough to make yourself significantly better off.
