The film is an amazing satire and a favourite of mine. I think its great the way Paul Verhoeven altered it from the book. Its a great film. The sequels, however, sucked ass.

I don't think he was suggesting that a fascist right wing society was "awesome" at all. It was a joke to see how these flashy pretty young people didn't even realise that they we're living in a fascist society. The film was meant to suggest the possibility of America becoming fascist. But to say he made it that way because he admired fascism and that he was trying to show that it's awesome is a little off the mark.

Ah the great war between the two factions: moon bois VS 'in it for the tech' gang. Whoever wins decides Satoshis fate.

Best of luck. Some advice: Don't check the price every five minutes. Don't worry about volatility. Don't try to outsmart the market and day trade. Hold and it will grow in time.

I've already let my alts bleed out for so long... it's hard to extinguish the glimmer of hope left. I feel like I've already lost too much to swap it back into BTC. Argh jesus fuck!

I think it's meant to look good though right? So much so that the main characters can't see past the reality of the situation. But maybe I misinterpreted your words. Regardless, I quite like his films. He's no master auteur or anything, but for some schlock action, they're pretty good. I guess the appeal of the inoffensive right wing imagery is why places like /pol/ adopted it. It doesn't look all that bad.

Blockstream are funded by AXA. The CEO of AXA is Henri de Castries and he has been chairman of the Bilderberg Group since 2012. It's fairly easy to look up.

Well sir, i'm happy to be proven wrong! As I have a lot invested in bitcoin, among many other cryptos. That's why my link question was posed as a question... after recently hearing and reading about this. Who is the CEO of AXA nowadays? I do like to wear my tin foil hat sometimes though and am open to any and all facts about the cryptos I invest in. How can I research all of the companies that have invested in Blockstream?

1. Electrum, or get a Nano S, or Nano X. 
2. You need to sign up to an exchange. Find one that works well in your country that will accept credit card or bank deposits and buy BTC. You can then sign to another exchange like Binance or [Okex.com]( and start trading what you wish. 
3. I've never had to delete a wallet, i'm sure its possible but i'm not sure.

Can someone ELI5 how the market price of Bitcoin works? If rich people keep buying OTC so they don't necessarily affect the market price, how is the market price decided? And if others keep buying OTC, when will the real value be consolidated and be properly reflected? Sorry if this sounds noobish. It doesn't make sense to me.

Yeah a stop loss I think. Like I said, it was my first time. Luckily it worked out reasonably well.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:27:17
Take a gamble. Have a sleep and wake up to a potential higher amount.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:20:38
I tried my first limit sell order overnight. I had it set for around 12k as I had a feeling it would drop overnight while I was asleep. I couldn't stop dreaming about the price all night. Stressful as fuck. But I still slept pretty well regardless. Anyways, I wake up and my threshold got triggered when it just dipped below 12k and I had sold off, only to find the price go back up to 12.6k. I was so pissed. So i drank my morning coffee and watched it slowly dip back below 12K after 10 minutes of staring at the screen, for only a minute or so, and managed to pick up even extra bitcoin in the process as I bought back in \*just\* in time. I was lucky. But don't do this. It's not worth it. I won't be doing that again. Hold.
