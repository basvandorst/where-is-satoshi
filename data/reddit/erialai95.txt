I assume so, because while i'm typing how much i want to send, the site sends me notification if there won't be enough left in my account for the fee.
For this transaction it did not so I assume I've paid the fee like i always have. 
Is network congestion something I should be worried about?

do you know how long i have to wait for the payment to go through or for it to get refunded to me?

ok so it says the transaction has been complete however the bitcoins are not in my wallet.
I've just noticed that my receiving wallet changed address thus different to the one I originally sent the BTC too.
Does this mean i've lost my bitcoin forever?

The transaction already says confirmed with 48 confirmations tho :/
here are the deets, hope they make sense:

ok I found a post saying this: 'The only time your address should change without you purposely creating a new one is by using our Multisig Vault. Since the Multisig vault is an HDM wallet, a new address is generated each time you receive bitcoin. However, similar to having multiple addresses in your standard Coinbase wallet, any payments sent to any address should be added to your one single wallet.'
I think the receiving wallet is a HDM wallet?
Heres the blockchain page:

If I could short bitcoin right i would as i don't see this becoming a normal form of payment when there are so many problems with it... 
Someone smart enough has to be able to produce an alternative right? *looks at Japan*
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:35:09
thanks, any idea why? also isit possible to pay a larger fee to speed things up?

I copied and pasted the address like I always do and make sure it's correct. After the 25 hours of waiting for the transaction to be confirmed I found out that the bitcoin address of my receiving wallet changed.
So the address showing in my wallet that I copied and pasted earlier changed thus being different to the one I originally sent my BTC too.
hope that made sense, i'm not sure what happened :/
