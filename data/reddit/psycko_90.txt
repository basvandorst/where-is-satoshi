Keep dreaming. It's good for your health.

I bought at 8k. I'm good.

I followed the advice I got here, just go on his youtube channel and watch everything you can, this dude is wonderful. He explain cryptocurrencies beautifully and in very simple terms so even if your not too good with technology, you'll be able to understand everything easily!

Simpsons porn is strangely interesting somehow.

I'm new to the cryptocurrencies world, who's this guy? What did he do? I see is name everywhere on the sub today!

What? Wtf... It's probably the stupidest argument against Bitcoin...
 The Office of National Drug Control Policy estimates that $100 billion worth of illegal drugs were sold in the U.S. in 2013. (
 
And that's probably all fiat money. If this is an argument against Bitcoin, it's an argument against every exchangeable goods. Because people will use anything they can to get drugs, sex, jewelry, electronics, etc.

Absolutely nothing. The price of 12 eggs, large is  270,950 VEF
@_date: 2019-03-22 22:37:01
I did...

No need to have the same price boom as the Bitcoin. If shitcoin worth 0.02$ jump to 0.25$, it's still really profitable if you bought a lot at 0.02$. 
It's like actions, most gold mine or silver mine in Canada don't worth much more than a couple cents by action, until they find a big stash of material, then it goes up 10x or 20x their value, you sell and profit.

Dude, your banks literally print money to send overseas. Some military contractor receive pallets stacked with cash. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:52:41
Yes. Just in a different form.
@_date: 2019-08-21 21:25:37
Clearly, you never watched Mission Impossible.

I might give it a try, but last time I tried Firefox (2 months ago). I deleted it 30min later, as always, because it was much much slower than chrome! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:32:40
I invest in Bitcoin, just because it's better than a stupid saving account with a bank. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:19:48
Always buy. Buy when it's high, buy more when it's low.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:08:00
yeah probably, I guess the big AD icon beside it is not enough to know it's not legit. People trust ads wait to much.

Headquarters are in Seoul, South Korea. That's what they said in your picture.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:49:46
Absolutely, that's why it's so awesome!
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:10:57
That's not how it works here. Landlord don't have those rights here. And I'm not even joking. We pay like 0.06$/kwh around here anyway
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:52:41
Yeah there's some Bitcoin ATM near where I live in Montreal, Canada. Saw it for the first time 2 weeks ago. You can buy/sell bitcoin on the go with your smartphone.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:21:41
Make a buy order and you can choose a "repeat" frequency
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:36:20
I agree, way better, more secure, easy to use and I think it's awesome to have money on an ultra secured hard wallet. It feels sci-fi as fuck lol
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:55:30
Well, you could click the "download" icon in the task bar at the top of the video?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:07:48
Does it worth it? Easy read or lots of technical terms? English is not my mother tongue so I might not understand everything if it has alot of technical terms!
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:28:14
I will never understand why phishing works... It's so obvious when it's a scam, you just have to read and use at least 2 brain cells to understand that it's a scam... Come on people, stop being lazy, start thinking before you make a move. In every part of your life. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:09:56
56 cents is not worth it I think. I mine using NiceHash too but I get around 1.50-2.00$/day but I don't pay my electricity since it's included in my rent. It's not much, but 600-700$ a year pay the pc upgrade so, why not. I could just keep this cash in Bitcoin and hodl too. Anyway, why say no to free money?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:20:41
Keep holding man! Resist the urge. You'll thank yourself later.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:57:41
Can't you read the Little "Ad" sticker besides your search results? Are you new to the internet? You need to be careful on what you click man! And when it's about money, do at least some research before! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:00:18
All right thank you guys!
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:22:04
The higher, the better. Just keep buying when you have extra money. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:33:07
What do you suggest to use instead of Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:49:23
You are missing his point entirely... And you're acting like a jerk for no reason. I hope that you don't always debate like that. Must be fucking annoying to have a discussion with you...
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:08:21
I've been using it for almost a year now and I didn't get any problems.
It's not a scam. You must have fucked up somewhere.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:25:09
Idk, maybe it's just obvious? There's a shit ton of leaders out there who are not as dumb as this President of America. Most of them don't want to see the world burn, and most of them don't want an all out war. No one would benefit from that. But big boy Trump need to use his toys and make use of his investment in weaponry corp. 
It's like a young kid who want to play with you on your PlayStation. Just give him an unpluged controller and makes him believe his in control.
