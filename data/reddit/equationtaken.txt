In case you're interested, whether for the prize or for fun (anyone can enter):
The time control is 3+0, meaning in each game, both players start with 3 minutes on the clock, and no additional time is given per move. This means that each game will last a maximum of 6 minutes, so it's pretty fast chess. It's called *blitz*.

Lichess has a cheat detection system, much like any reasonable online chess site.
It uses chess engines to evaluate a player's moves vs. the ones that would be made by a computer.
Obviously, good players will often find the best moves without engines, so it's a fine line to walk when determining whether or not a player is cheating.
I think Lichess will be particularly stalwart in events like these.
High rated players are also able to reliably tell when they are playing against a computer in an online setting. There's something about the feeling of being absolutely cornered in every possible way, that you don't get when playing against another human, so players are also able to report others, causing the cheat detection systems to take a closer look.

It was quite clear that there's a list of currencies to choose from. Obviously USD is on that list.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:56:39
It seems to be alphabetical, with the exception of BTC being at the top. But yeah, I expect USD is definitely in that list.

Because once someone gets upvoted/downvoted, it becomes a bandwagon. If the scores remain hidden for a while, it kinda forces people to make their own decisions about whether they want to UV/DV.
I think it's up to the mods whether they want this feature on their subreddit. It's not enforced everywhere.
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:22:38
Yup. I didn't explicitly say it, but it's only temporary of course.

Why in the FUCK are you considering paying?
Why in the FUCK does the law firm not have backups?
Why in the FUCK does the law firm not have a secure node to store their information on?

I want money for nothing.
@_date: 2014-09-24 10:27:07
Pretty spot OFF actually. PayPal isn't a merchant, and you're now giving BTC cuts to them. Of course, with no option to buy.
@_date: 2014-09-10 10:23:48
Who said that? You said that.
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:50:07
Not as fucked as a law firm that keeps paying extortionists.

Implying we aren't already on some list...
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:25:27
Yeah, the price is off the fucking charts in terms of a linear scale, and people are still not convinced. The log scale actually understates how well BTC is doing here.

He was talking about someone having $5M stolen from them in a Slovenian BTC exchange, and added "man, if you're not safe to keep your money in a Slovenian bitcoin exchange, where CAN you keep your money?"
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:32:54
Great. You're agreeing with me, and phrasing it as a correction. Cringe.
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:24:17
That was... remarkably well done by whoever made it.
@_date: 2016-01-10 10:50:52
"ACK" stands for "Acknowledge(ment)" which is a term used in data communications. It's a pretty organic transition to, from there, use it on other places where people are mostly tech savvy.

How about my 20?

Cats and bitcoin. Reddit's two favorite things.

If you OpenSource it, I can almost certainly port it to Android.

Shame to see the Apple-heads downvoting you =(
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:23:18
If it goes consistently &gt;1000, you could change it to measure $ per mBTC.
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:17:06
What the hell? You say Apple isn't anti-bitcoin, without source. Then someone disagrees, and _you_ ask for source? Shouldn't you have sourced in the first place?
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:18:15
Succinct, yes. But not clear. I mean, the details of BTC is what makes it interesting in the first place, in my humble opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:18:58
Not sure dumping Apple stock was the best step. It's not like they'll lose a whole lot of market share over this just yet.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:29:01
Yeah, but I'm actually OK with that. Means I'm doing something right.
