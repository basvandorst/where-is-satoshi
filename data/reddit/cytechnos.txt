I agree completely agree lesson well taken .. Stupidity and Just lazy ..
Yes for some odd reason we was saying that the screen share did not work and that if i cave him access he would not move the mouse .. if hey did i could just close the connection .. this I see this script thing pop up and in under  2 seconds opened the browser and logged in my my saved password then cliked walled and entered BTC addy and hit send It all happen in a flash I jumped up out my seat and unplugged the PC but not after hearing the dreaded Beep Beep Under 2 fucking seconds.
I found this user on LBC and we were gonna traded VC for BTC ..

Hello there , my attacker did not have control of my private keys .
he merely used some kind of script to launch on TeamViewer and the mouse did all the work .. it logged into blockchain.info hit my wallet and entered his btc address and in the flick of a 3 secs sent the btc to that address .. what I dont understand is that in my blockchain.info wallet 2FF Phone auth was turned on :( anyway talk about making a person cry ..
