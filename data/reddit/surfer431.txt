You seem to think the number of coins matters at all. The only thing that matters is the ratio to total supply and final supply.
In the short term both Bitcoin and Dogecoin are inflationary. In fact, BTC has 10% inflation right now wherease Dogecoin has only 5% inflation. 
Only in the intermediate term will the inflation of Dogecoin matter much at all.
In the long term Dogecoin is only insignificantly inflationary. That won't affect the scarcity. And again, we are talking about long term because Bitcoin sure isn't scarce right now with 10% inflation.

The thing is that the 5 billion for the rest of eternity is insignificant because the inflation rate is also dropping for eternity. Your argument that Doge can't be scarce will be absurd when the yearly inflation is 0.01%.

Large reservoirs required for the operation of hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams, destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests, marshland and grasslands. The loss of land is often exacerbated by habitat fragmentation of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir.[29]
Hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic ecosystems both upstream and downstream of the plant site. Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment. Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks.[30] Since turbine gates are often opened intermittently, rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed.

The circumstantial fallacy applies only where the source taking a position is only making a logical argument from premises that are generally accepted. Where the source seeks to convince an audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by **personal observation**, observation of their circumstances may reduce the evidentiary weight of the claims, sometimes to zero.

Compact disc, or CD for short, is a digital optical disc data storage format. The format was originally developed to store and play back sound recordings only (CD-DA), but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CDs and audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982.
