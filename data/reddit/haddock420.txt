Dr. Pepper could be a woman and you should be ashamed that you've never thought about this until now.

Why didn't we all cash out in 2017?

Why do you have to withdraw the entire balance at once?
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:43:27
It's funny, I posted a comment on saying I'd bought £1 of bitcoin. A few days later I had a message from a reporter saying they wanted to ask me a few questions about bitcoin.

I keep all my crypto in an IRC tip bot.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:32:27
This is gonna go up a lot more before it goes down again.

Oh cool, I didn't realise there were reddit tip bots. I thought they'd all shut down.

I bought 0.53 btc at $200 then sold it at $300.

So if someone steals your watch, not only do they have your watch but your bitcoin as well.

You can buy as little as £1 on Coinbase, but you have to pay a £0.99 fee.
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:03:40
I like how someone said you should put your bitcoin in cold storage with a label that says "Do not open until 2017."
2017 being the year that it hit 20k.
@_date: 2018-11-09 12:43:57
I have 0.0007. If BTC goes to 1 mil, I'll have a cool $700.
@_date: 2018-11-11 15:37:47
Congrats on getting your bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:15:42
OH MY GOD WE'RE HAVING A FIRE sale
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:58:35
I bought them through coinbase and paid a £0.99 fee. I'm probably just going to keep them in my coinbase wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:02:20
How much could you possibly make from an advertising screen computer? They can't be very powerful.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:21:57
I just bought my first ever bitcoins. 0.00021 btc for £1. Time to ride the gravy train.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:59:12
It's the minimum amount coinbase will let you buy.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:11:01
What the hell happened?
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:07:59
Do you think they'll lower that limit when the BTC price goes up/BTC becomes more scarce?
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:02:36
It's 0.006086 btc, so just multiply that by 50k.
So $304.30.
@_date: 2019-09-18 14:44:28
Imagine buying bitcoin cash thinking you were buying btc and then one day you go to cash out your btc and find it's only worth a fraction of what you thought because you got misled and bought something else instead.

Oh, I was thinking 0.08% was the same as 0.08 which it isn't. I was thinking it would be $245 lol.
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:07:11
This guy is holding 0.08% of all coins and I can't even accumulate 0.08% of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:11:43
How do the bitcoin payments actually work?
Do you just get them to send some btc to your wallet and then once the payment is confirmed you give them their order?
I guess you've got a better method than that but I can't really imagine how this works.
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:57:33


Have you got a source for this? I couldn't find anything on Google.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:05:04
Also r/brum may appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:09:09
If we're dealing in uBTC, wouldn't that mean the price of 1 BTC would be over $1 million?
Could it actually get that high in just a few years?
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:50:24
@_date: 2013-12-09 13:48:44
Is it really that hard to buy bitcoin for these guys?
I've bought and sold bitcoin before and each time it was really easy, the transaction was done in less than 20 minutes each time.
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:48:04
Holy shit. Does he believe bitcoin can't fail, or does he just like to live dangerously?
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:53:19
I can't see any way this could go wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:03:05
Have you tried localbitcoins? That's where I got mine and I didn't have any problems with it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:05:01
You should look into a debt management plan if you're paying 80% of your money to the rent and CC.
They can freeze the credit card interest and reduce your payment down to something affordable. Not sure if it's the same where you are, but here in the UK there are companies that will do this for you for free.
Just a suggestion, I've struggled with debt before (still am but not nearly as badly) and I know how stressful it can be.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:53:39
Hopefully he'll send a few BTC my way.
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:05:11
Nonsense! It's clear from that graph that the price has gone up by at least two pixels!
