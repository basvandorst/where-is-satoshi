Just so you know, hedge funs "warm up" to things like bitcoin because they like to profit off of retail investors who are blinded by bias, also known as this subreddit. It makes it all the more funny you think that is a good thing worth showing off, but the point remains.

Every response past this is awful. I'm very surprised people upvoted the former two comments. They're too well informed.
When a community like this is born, the fanaticism is so exponential you can do nothing but try to look away from the car crash as much as possible, and enjoy the brief moments of clarity like this.

Ignoring how $20m is still insignificant (especially when that's a 2015 number and especially when comparing to the press/fanaticism behind bitcoin) saying "it could be $10m full year" is just you saying that. Maybe the first $1m is it's blowing up phase and after that no one else cares at all. 
Putting that as plainly and nicely as possible, it's a good example of how little actual analysis is behind this wave of bitcoin fans, and hopefully is a good motivation for any reader to transfer any inordinately-large share of their portfolio out of this area.
Not saying you have any stake, but indexing small-cap US, even emerging markets, would be a much smarter thing to support/invest.

Why would anyone want to hear the personal opinions of someone who lost 280k from investing in bitcoin?
The only reason you got the call was because of your loss, not because your thoughts were insightful.

Please realize how de minimis $1m in sales is for a company like overstock

Linked here from a bloomberg article making fun of you all. The messed up part is the other threads are taken seriously here.

Except bitcoin is more easily traceable than other types of currency. You're all the experts though...

Thanks! You are wise beyond your years

The fact that this is upvoted is the most laughable thing I've seen on this reddit today.
Hi, cfa analyst here. I came here for a good laugh but now I feel bad so please realize that a few hundred people on reddit mean nothing for the price of an investment with as much an as many risks as bitcoin has.
I have no investment in bitcoin, and will give you textbook advice about how you should not sell out of fear. Thanks for the entertainment.
