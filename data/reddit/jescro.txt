Congrats, I just bought ~$40 CDN worth two weeks ago @ $0.29/PPUSD :) - It's already trading at around $0.40/PPUSD with good volume.

Oh yea, I suppose I should share too if I'm asking - I clock in at a whopping 0.07 BTC

So true, I'd have much more BTC right now if it had been easier to purchase. I'm cautiously optimistic to see coinlab open up at the end of the month. Fingers crossed.

When we launch we'll have targeting by Country/City, Browser, OS, and the ability to toggle on/off individual publishers. We'll support conversion tracking with a simple JS pixel. More advanced demographic and behavioural will be down the road when we have the volume to support it.

For sure, I am an online media buyer as my full time occupation. I am all about the conversion rate and ROI from my online ad buys. We'll have every measure in place, and the ability to turn off low performing publishers, day parting, geo and browser/OS targeting, etc.
I'll PM you when we launch

hah, fully anticipating that. We'll surely have a major supply/demand issue starting out - We can backfill our publisher's with RTB Exchange inventory (which we get paid in $USD on a net30 basis), unfortunately the only way we can compensate for this part of the inventory is holding the value and exchanging at market rate 30 days after the end of each month, then moving that to the pub's available BTC balance. I imagine most publisher's wont be too happy with that
