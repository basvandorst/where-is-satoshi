That’s pretty much what I said?

It was invented by US Naval Research Laboratories. Backdoor TBA

From a defensive position there’s probably threats that are closer to you than the US Gov.   In terms of crypto and or finance in general: passwords, 2fa devices, vpn's, password managers, hardware/paper wallets  etc are about as safe as you can get.
The weakest part of any security is probably not going to be the tech.

I don’t recommend doing anything on a computer that you wouldn’t want another person to know.
That said, TOR has its issues. VPNs have their issues. Each solves different problems. A VPN doesn’t make you anonymous and TOR won’t hide your presence. Use the tool you need for the situation

To be announced. There could be one we haven’t found yet, though the code is open-source so anyone is free to go over it to check(and security researchers do this).

I honestly don't know. I'd say the first option if they're different passwords. Then it becomes an issue of remembering several complex 15 character passwords. So I guess maybe the 2nd option?

I went on in other replies there, including your point about being peer reviewed/open source. The TOR project still receives a significant amount of funding from the US government(80% in 2012). I’m not saying TOR has a backdoor. I just think you should never consider anything you do online to be 100% secure. That said, most security faults are human.
My ultimate point. TOR and VPNs are both great, distinct security tools. But if you’re doing something you’re not supposed to, even while being as secure as possible, you run the risk of eventually being caught or hacked or something. As such, proceed accordingly.
