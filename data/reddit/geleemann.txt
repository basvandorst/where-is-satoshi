BTC will reach $50k, then $100k, then $1m each coin. mark my words
@_date: 2019-07-31 09:47:36
Money/fiat has value because people give it value. the 'belief' that is has value.
With Bitcoin that has value because people believe it does. BTC is going to be worth an insane amount soon

In Australia withdrawing is most definitely taxable

Wrong. You said it yourself. Crypto - fiat. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:25:12
Because it will devalue the USD if nobody uses it
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:49:22
Any suggestion for somebody living in Australia? 
@_date: 2019-07-31 09:43:57
cool. Still buying bitcoin once my debt is paid off in january. Fuck banks
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:29:48
Banks will not tolerate this, what if they start a war against the people?

From an outsider (Australian here) your government is fucking insane
Edit: im assuming you live in the USA? If not, still... The U.S. Government is insane

Sorry about your dad, hope you are dealing with the sadness a bit better now. I'm not scared about my own death, but others

@_date: 2019-08-07 17:43:24
yeah... you need a third back up.
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:10:29
Now zoom in on that screw
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:19:16
People will move to other banks.
People will then HODL
People will leave the country so they can use banks that do. 
Then shit hits the fan

Steven crowder is an idiot conservative and wouldn't back Bitcoin anyway
@_date: 2019-08-03 07:02:00
I will literally cut off my nuts if any of that happens

After reading this putting 50% paycheck (after expenses)  into Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:43:46
Gonna need a source for that 11%
@_date: 2019-08-22 03:37:49
Can you Explain what you mean by product-market fit? 
Adoption has been increasing over the years, people that want to get into Bitcoin will thrive, people that don't,  won't. 
Can you address product market fit? What are the solutions? People are lazy and don't want to take the best measurements for protection at this point in time I.e. What i listed above
@_date: 2019-08-23 01:52:19
Thanks assbandit
@_date: 2019-08-15 03:34:58
But it's been up since 2015
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:07:22
Not really because they need to pay even more tax than if they just HODL'd. Day trading is shite.

Speech is not protected in the U.S. e.g. Snowden and Assange
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:30:29
well, you can via Paypal, Ebay etc
@_date: 2019-08-02 03:22:27
Their fees are too high. Independent Reserve, Binance or BTC Markets are better

that's at least a $7,000 lesson for you

How do we know Bitcoin isn't a scam? I want to know more before I invest
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:36:54
probably because it's digital
I've never seen light protons, but can still see

Plot twist: this is the mum, trying to recover her sons BTC for herself
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:19:51
curious, why?
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:39:55
"forget your login details" Don't be a dumbass then, and store them somewhere.
"your house burns down" store in multiple places, store your seed on stainless steel.
"leave nothing for your family because nobody had access to your private keys" Get a lawyer and set up a will for said keys. 
these aren't problems with bitcoin, these are problems with stupid people
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:24:46
Thank you
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:06:23
why does per hour matter? You're a day trader, ew.
@_date: 2019-08-04 05:26:52
!Remind me 2 years
@_date: 2019-08-06 03:12:04
You're an idiot. People use fiat for illegal activity
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:52:43
The people should be so angry at what banks have done.  Fiat currency is backed by literally nothing. Just a made up number that has value on paper. We are slaves to debt.
@_date: 2019-08-03 06:49:31
You do realise banks take days to confirm a transfer. And won't even do it on a weekend
I want to send and recieve money when I want, how I want and I don't want those greedy fucks to get a dime or know about it
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:23:07
if you are worried, then investing isn't for you, especially HODLing
@_date: 2019-08-22 11:11:59
Butthurt, want some baby powder?
@_date: 2019-08-03 10:45:17
Not talking about crypto, talking about banks

Thanks for the insightful reply cuck

I know. I never said it was

can only lose if you sell. The OP never mentioned that you'd have to sell in the title
@_date: 2019-08-06 03:19:53
Value increases.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:50:48
Ah ok. I'm thinking more in terms of a recession. I know what you mean now
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:14:43
Holy shit. Price will be in the millions for sure within next 8 years
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:03:42
even though 1 bitcoin is worth 8.5k aud. yeah ok
@_date: 2019-02-07 04:38:55
Just because you don't have or see a use for it, millions of other people do. That's just cryptocurrency in general, not only Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-24 11:40:46
even better, you don't even need to hit it and it will still depreciate in value as soon as you drive it off the lot, and over the years. New cars are shit.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:08:14
Banks can't insure your money. If they go broke, so do you.
@_date: 2019-06-24 11:36:23
It's risky not to invest in it, let alone some other alt coins
@_date: 2018-11-02 17:26:56
weird flex but ok
@_date: 2019-01-13 12:53:20
Not my or our fucken job to support the economy, ill do what I want. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 18:18:22
So is fiat. Media are a bunch of dumb fucks
@_date: 2019-01-02 05:32:17
No problem 
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:34:53
Money has value only because we deem it valuable. If the whole mindset of crypto changes, bitcoin can be seen as gold and be worth 200k each for example
@_date: 2019-05-24 03:49:54
I facepalm every time i hear this. And so fiat currency isn't used for those things?
