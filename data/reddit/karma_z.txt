I’m not sure if anyone has bothered explaining on BTC forums yet but generally speaking buy/sell walls are almost literally never real. It’s just posturing by big traders. The wall will be moved fairly consistently to help influence the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:54:42
No it isn't.  It's value is driven by speculation, not adoption.  There's almost literally no BTC use in the real world as a % of volume vs trading.  It's a commodity.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:28:13
Yeah sure. Let me explain. Wall Street has already accumulated enough BTC to force margin traders out whenever they want and force a massive price decrease if they want. This whole sub HODLING for dear life does nothing to change the other hundreds of thousands to millions who would also openly sell. 
If you think a rise from $2k - $18k in 6 months isn’t a result of billion+ funds accumulating positions you’re definitely insane. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:14:26
No people will absolutely be shorting it because that’s how futures work (someone is both long (buyer) and short (seller) on every contract) but whether or not it will negatively impact BTCs price depends on the magnitude of $ trying to short BTC to drive the price down. 
Long long term it has 0 impact (I.e. if BTC is super overvalued it will lose value over, if it is under valued it will gain value over time) but short term this could either cause a very fast price correction, resulting in less volatility going forward but temporarily reducing the price, or could add more jet fuel to the crazy momentum BTC already has. That’s the hard part, no one knows what the real outcome is. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:21:29
...?  What?  This is a fact, it is not fear.  Stop being ignorant.  The top 40% rich wallets are NOT exchanges, those were precluded from the research.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:25:47
You guys are massively blowing this out of proportion from having zero understanding of what is actually happening... people with significant gains from crypto SHOULD be paying taxes (once/if they cash out) just like with any other investment.  End of story.  Easy.

Why would someone with that large of an intelligent network waste their time on reddit with literally hundreds of thousands of idiots asking stupid questions?

That’s probably correct. But in order to be on this subreddit you have to have access to the internet, which gives you an incredible amount of actually valid and intelligent learning resources to leverage.  The scarier part is that people try to learn on reddit with no/little precious knowledge. The phrase “idiots spreading ignorance” comes to mind.

Are you honestly this delusional? Get out of this sub and read some non bullshit every once in awhile. 
Coinbase is doing just fine. Insider trading is LITERALLY not possible in crypto, you dumbass.  US equities exchanges are not getting involved in BTC. These are futures backed Etf proposals which will do nothing but further the logical conclusion that BTC is worthless other than as a speculative instrument. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:00:11

 Your comment just makes me doubt you're even aware what these exchanges trade.  And yes, it is a very sleepy exchange relative to CME for the futures market, which is literally the only thing relevant to this discussion today.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:46:15
I’m not sure if you’re intentionally being ignorant or if you just can’t read but these are CASH SETTLED FUTURES meaning to do not buy or sell or deliver or cover your positions with real coins. Literally just cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:49:25
This is a very ignorant viewpoint.  Anyone shorting BTC cash markets can easily buy or sell on Gemini in quantities we’ve never even seen before which directly affects their profit in the cash market because CBOE is only using one exchange as a pricing mechanism. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:20:01

I mean they’re not wrong. BTC is the AOL, the MySpace, the Dinosaur, but it’s still early days.

Yeah you’re a dumbass. JPM hasn’t bought any BTC, not even on behalf of clients. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:32:35
I honestly have a headache from reading so many idiotic comments.  You guys don't even know who your actual 'enemies' are in this scenario or who 'wall street' is for that matter.  BANKS ARE NOT WALL STREET IN THIS REGARD, THEY CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE TRADING ANYTHING (especially crypto) FOR THEIR OWN ACCOUNTS.  THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROP TRADE SINCE 2008. WELLS FARGO IS NOT THE ONE ATTEMPTING TO SHORT THE BITCOIN MARKET.  For starters.  Hedge funds are an entirely different beast than banks.  Banks are just service engines for their clients, they hardly do anything risky or revolutionary anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:57:37
Basically nothing does.  BTC is screwed at this point.  It is a meme that caught on and somehow converted the 'peer to peer ecash system' created by Satoshi into 'a store of value' and 'gold 2.0' because you can't use it to transact at all.  Cool stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:27:46
It actually doesn't.  You're just financially illiterate. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:58:54
Yeah the problem is there are viable crypto alternatives that also appreciate in price while being super cheap to transact and near instant payments.  Being deflationary isn't necessarily a good thing, it's just a mechanism to force the price up over time.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:30:57
... What?  Banks cannot and do not hold BTC.  They also cannot trade directionally at all.  This is so incorrect.  Short term the drop would be from arbitrage traders affecting the price to remain in line with the futures (which absolutely will happen) and potentially hedge funds/prop shops unloading their massive amounts of acquired BTC.  Alternatively they just buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:27:54
Honestly, and unfortunately, all Crypto related content is usually hugely biased.  Especially if it's BTC (because it's typically biased against BCH, and vice-versa) you just have to read through the garbage and attempt to decipher useful information yourself while avoiding the bias.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:22:39
Bitcoin isn’t a currency in its current state. Scaling issues made sure of that. It’s ‘digital gold’ now, aka a commodity.  Even if it were it would be applicable because of a limited supply.  It’s relative in traditional currencies as well but it’s called a money supply instead of market cap, doesn’t make the concept any less relevant. 
It sure does matter every time it hits a milestone “omg $200bn market cap!!!” Just not when it doesn’t fit the narrative here. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:25:40
It really is the same thing though.  People sell futures for many reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:58:21
This logic is so retarded.  You realize 1000 people own FOURTY PERCENT (40%) of ALL BTC OUTSTANDING, right?  This collective sub probably owns 0.5-3% of all BTC absolute best case.  There are A LOT of other sellers in the world besides reddit.  That and Redditers have proven they're uber weak handed and will fold as soon as the price buckles.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:32:22
'Diversifying' further into crypto is not diversification.  Crypto is an all or nothing game.  If BTC dies it will wreak havoc among the entire crytosphere and everything you've 'diversified' into will get destroyed as well.  Only way this changes is if Eth/LTC get futures, larger % of market cap, etc., in the future and can stand on their own.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:32:07

@_date: 2017-12-22 06:01:50
Yeah... the whole world is finally starting to realize BTC has no actual use other than as a speculative instrument. Obviously the goal is for that to change over time, but if transaction confirms still take 4 days and fees remain absurdly high for a few months people will move on to better options entirely. That isn’t FUD, that’s reality. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:24:46

The conspiracy thing is kinda bullshit. Btc community needs to get over it.  Eth is fundamentally better in literally every way, and the devs are orders of magnitude better.

Actually this will be totally irrelevant. These etfs use the futures as their underlying security so the net effect on BTC coin demand is 0, just like the futures. Just let’s TONS of money come in without actually touching the underlying coins. This is one of the big reasons BTC hasn’t gone anywhere but down since the futures became available.

@_date: 2017-12-09 06:59:42
Wrong.  One side offsets the risk by buying the opposite end of another contract, they take fees for buying/selling and exit the trade, they're position neutral at all times.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:32:56
Actually that’s what makes it such an ideal trade, it would be quick.  You wouldn’t be shorting on Gemini though. Just selling existing coins into it. Gemini’s lack of volume (relative to the amounts I’ve talked about) would only exacerbate the problem and help the person trying to profit from the short futures leg of his trade. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:26:56
Rofl. Please tell me you aren’t that clueless?  The ‘store of value’ is FAKE it is a MEME the only reason BTC is a store of value is because people belief it is. In that sense BTC is literally worthless as soon as people decide it is.
The only reason the ‘store of value’ bullshit was adopted in the first place is because the devs refused to address scaling and now BTC is functionally useless. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:41:42
Fear of missing out.  It’s essentially the driving force behind these MASSIVE recoveries immediately after 20% dips. (That and more intelligent/patient buyers waiting for the dips to buy). 
Once normal people see the price surging they’re blinded by how much money they could be missing out on and FOMO buy regardless of the price. (Historically in BTC this has been very true). 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:05:23

Kind of, but not really.  In modern finance clearing houses are taking the opposite side of as many trades as possible to collect as many commissions and spreads as possible while offsetting the risk continually.  They are financially motivated to do so and have much better infrastructure and eliminate counterparty risk much more so than simply taking the other side of some unknown party's trade.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:49:26
This entire post reads like someone looked up ‘futures’ on investopedia and then dumbed it down a bit. There is zero industry jargon (which a trader would absolutely use, it’s a natural part of their language) and there’s hardly anything specific at all in the post, just very vague comments about how there won’t be a big effect (Traders are not that indecisive and passive).   
Not to mention no futures trader would say any futures contract launching for the first time on an underlying asset with volatility as brutal as BTC’s would have a small effect on the market. We’re adding the potential for institutional investors to take opinionated stances on BTC, some of these institutions manage 80x the capital of BTCs market cap. (Obviously they won’t be putting even a fraction of that into BTC, but the sheer $ volume coming is enormous). 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:01:13
"SEC gives btc a nod" meaning "SEC puts out statement about ICOs specifically which (logically) does not address btc in any way"? and "ETFs incoming" meaning "we have literally no comment or update on the status of ETFs"...?

I agree that it’s positive PR and that Novo legitimizes it, but no real institutional investor gives a shit about what CNBC says other than to gauge what the average retail investor is being exposed to and how to best use that information.

I understand what you're trying to do, its just not correct.  Even if it it made sense it's a terrible argument unless you think BTC is worth about 1% of it's current price.

It's Sunday in the US, and the CBOE is small, this is just the warm up round so all the big boys can stand on the sidelines and watch the market develop.  Most clearing houses said they WOULD NOT participate in the CBOE opening and would not allow their clients to do so.  Even the more 'bullish' ones (Goldman, for instance) is only allowing the privilege to trade CBOE to 'specific clients'.  Instead they're going to wait and watch the volume leading up to CME and watch the volatility to determine if it's a product they're willing to offer their trading customers.  Depending on how the next week goes, CME will be MASSIVE.  This is nothing, Gemini volume only up~15%.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:54:09
Yeah you read a wiki for 5 seconds and can dismiss someone who has been in the industry for five years. Makes sense, reddit logic at it’s finest. 
Of course someone is always long and short, but that isn’t true of every contract in terms of a delta neutral portfolio. 
Nearly always what you get is a market maker / clearing house will enter into 2 contracts, one with buyer A and one with Seller B. Market maker SELLS (short side) of a contract to buyer A and BUYS (long side) the contract from Seller B. What is the end result?  They have a neutral position.  Their whole goal is to maximize transaction volume for fees, they are not interested in speculating on price movement and do everything they can to avoid it. 
Ultimately this leads to someone ending long and short, but not on the same specific contract where both buyer and seller are almost never both wanting risk exposure directly.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:17:03
Market cap doesn’t apply to crypto... do you have any idea how stupid that sounds?  What does apply to crypto then?  An infinite valuation? $1mm per BTC for a total of $21 trillion or about 25% of US gdp?

You can rest assured if any firm was considering doing this they are very prepared.  It’s also way less risky than you think.  You can basically lock in your maximum total losses at whatever price you want going long additional futures contracts.  If you could make this trade and potentially make multiples of your money and the risk was 10% loss it may or may not be worth it, depends on the funds risk tolerance and positioning.

I don't disagree, but i'm more curious to see what happens when CME goes live.

Are you actually equating blockchains (backed by nothing, other than the network supporting them) with international currencies (backed by various governments with economies of various size and scale)?  Do you understand how stupid that is?  Comparing the USD to venezuelan bolivar is not helpful in deciding what is a 'tier 1' blockchain.
Bitcoin is an awful form of money in its current state.  Let me go to the grocery store real quick and wait 2 hours and pay $20 to get my transaction completed.  Great.
We are still in the infancy of blockchain tech, bitcoin happens to be the most famous blockchain application (it is objectively not the 'best' form of money on a blockchain currently) only time will tell if its devs actually do anything to make it competitive as something other than a hype fueled gold rush, which it currently is.

Do you have any idea how much money Wall Street stands to make from implementing private chains alone?  Not even mentioning crypto derivatives, trading services, storage services, custodian services, etc., etc., etc., every single bank on wall street has entire dedicated teams for blockchain implementation and R&amp;D already.  Banks are hosting crypto panels and discussions on a weekly basis.
Wall street cares A LOT about blockchain tech.  They just don't necessarily care about BTC, the two are not mutually exclusive.

This is literally the stupidest reddit FUD i've seen in sadly only a day or two because this sub is king of idiotic FUD.
The MUCH MORE realistic scenario is a hedge fund has accumulated a $250mm-$1bn position in BTC and will load up on short futures near the expiry of the first contract and sell their entire position into Gemini causing the price to tank (and effectively allowing them to sell at the top) while making an absurd amount of money on their futures.
Also a 'circulating currency' isn't even 1% of the demand for btc.  It's purely a speculative commodity at this point.  Nearly no one transacts with it.

I’d personally just wait and see or buy half now and half after futures if you want to be more aggressive.  Downside crypto rallies on futures launch and you have to buy at $2k-$6k higher prices for BTC (as in worst case for you) and best case for you pricing gets destroyed (short term) enabling you to buy more. It could also be a non event but so far non events in crypto end up adding $1k+ to BTC just because people are insane.

I haven’t read your post, the first sentence is already wrong. You’re confusing pure speculation with an over five approach to investing. If you want to speculate on altcoins that already trade at 100-1000x their actual value (usually about $0) then be my guest. But if you think Iota signing a single partnership with one company all of a sudden makes it actually worth $3bn or whatever t is now?  That’s insanity.  VC funded startups partner with Microsoft, google, amazon, Facebook, etc every day which just allows them to not go bankrupt and continue adoption. It does not 10x-50x their value upon release of the news. 
TL:DR - don’t be stupid enough to confuse people gambling and making lucky money with an intelligent approach that is repeatable. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:26:42
Did you even read the article...?  It's saying BTC isn't comparable to any of the banks and isn't even close to their true value (AUM).  BTC has no equity, so it's stupid to compare it to a banks equity value.

@_date: 2017-12-08 02:42:54
No that's actually not the case at all.  Market makers in futures just take opposite ends of the trade on different contracts to hedge (i.e. 10 contracts long 10 contracts short, execute essentially simultaneously), it's way cheaper and more efficient.  No one will be hedging through actual coins (other than those who already own the coins, and are using the futures to hedge their existing stash).  That's exactly how all cash settled futures work.  No trader is buying physical crude to hedge his crude futures unless he has to or there's an arbitrage opportunity in doing so.

I’m not sure you read what I said at all, or just took it entirely out of context, but your last point I 100% agree with. I’ve always said everyone should have a small allocation to crypto, these forums tend to indoctrinate people to idiotic ideas like 100% crypto, taking out loans to buy crypto, etc. 
But if you’re actually comparing the S&amp;P’s 300ish% gain over 9 years to Eth’s 5500% in a year or BTCs 1500% in a year and don’t find that to be quite a stretch then I’ll leave you to it.  Also if you actually think BTC will recover from 20% dips in a day like it has I truly fear for you when it doesn’t. You’ll just be plowing money into the dip that doesn’t return. Trying to apply past behavior to markets is very stupid when there’s this level of euphoria and a complete lack of valuation attached to an asset that most people don’t even understand. Just takes one quick black swan event (tether scandal being real, Bitfinex going under, sweeping regulation, BTC hack, people finally realizing BTC is pretty weak technologically compared to peers, etc) and you’re wishing it was only a 20% drop.

No. I’m not saying it will crash 50%, but I’m saying the possibility is definitely there.  Futures have circuit breakers so that market can’t move more than 20% in a day, but the underlying BTC markets could definitely continue to crumble.  Things could also go up after the futures launch.  I’m just pointing out a very real scenario because crypto subs fundamentally shun all info that doesn’t agree with their worldview.

Rofl. Not at all. For 90% of the financial community BTC = crypto, they aren’t even aware that bcash exists. 
If the scenario I just mentioned plays out it’ll obliterate all crypto pricing for a few days and overall pricing may change in terms of status quo but it would still be a benefit to BTC relative to total crypto cap. Wouldn’t help bcash at all. Considering how fanatically insane the population has become I’d assume even a 50-70% dip eventually sparks a pretty significant rally because people FOMO way too hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:20:54
Possible?  Absolutely. The problem is tokens are fundamentally worthless and only derive value by the value assigned to them and that is the system currently in place and most people seem to be perfectly ok with it. 
During the idiotic (and partially ongoing) ICO frenzy developers realized they could fund their companies with literally worthless tokens because people wanted to speculate on them.  This is VERY different than how a company raised money from a VC (or from the public markets) because tokens don’t entitle you to anything the company has or owns nor does it give you ownership of a fraction of their income.
As a result of this we would only see equity arrangements as you see in the real finance community once this industry matures significantly.  Crypto developers are (generally) some of the greediest people I’ve ever encountered in finance, they aren’t going to want to give up the practice of raising $50m for nothing if they don’t have to.

Look at the trends since BTC futures. BTC is down 25%, yet the total crypto cap is up what $80-$100bn?  That means even with the HUGE negative hit from BTC money is still flowing into crypto, just not into BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:03:21
I’m sorry but you clearly have zero trading experience and have no idea what you’re talking about. 
The last several flash crashes were driven by weak handed noobs panicking after 5% drops from profit taking which got super exacerbated by levered longs being liquidated and another wave of panic selling prior to the FOMO rebuy. This would cause ALL OF THAT in addition to legitimately massive financial players selling $50m MORE into a single exchange (50% of average daily volume) in this particular example. That is why you do not get a 30% drop. That is why you get a 50-70% drop.
$250m of futures is less than 25,000 contracts, the market will easily be that big.  That’s only 12% of the globally daily traded bitcoin volume currently, which includes pretty much zero relevant financial institutions. The amount of money capable of moving into this space on Sunday is mind boggling. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:20:45
... ok so you’re just stupid.  Thank you for confirming.  I work at a hedge fund and have worked at a prop shop previously, but yes I clearly have no trading experience.  
If you sell a future someone else is buying, definitionally.  And yes there will be arb.  But guess what?  No one is prepared to arb $50m (number is completely arbitrary but this is what has been used thus far) and it would absolutely obliterate the price inducing panic selling on other exchanges and massive buying on Gemini.  The effect (for the short futures holder) is the same. You get a significant window with which to cash out before the price is arbitraged to a more reasonable, but still significant, discount to the open.
The other hilarious part is BTCs network is still clogged so if you didn’t already have funds on Gemini to arb the prices there you’re completely screwed, it would take 30-120 minutes just to move your coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:00:51
Yes.  If you buy it this second for $11,000 and sell it in 8 seconds for $11,200 that's a taxable event for a gain of $200.  
If you bought it at $1 years ago and sold it today at $11,200 that's a taxable event at capital gains rate for $11,199.
ANY trade involving profit is a taxable event.  The length of holding (less than a year, or greater than a year) determines whether or not you're paying your income tax rate or capital gains rate.

People shouldn't keep it all in BTC.  BTC will almost surely fail in the end.  BTC is the MySpace, (or even the Friendster) of Crypto.  I don't define Eth or LTC as 'altcoins' btw, they exist on their own.  Ultimately a better coin with better developers and a better community (Eth comes to mind) have a substantial advantage over BTC, whose literal only advantage is first mover / mind share among consumers.  BTC isn't even used for its intended purpose (peer to peer instant near free payments) it's just a speculative commodity like anything else.
What I am saying is IF BTC fails in the near future the entire crypto ecosystem (other than potentially Eth and smaller chance LTC) die with it.  BTC = Crypto to 99% of the world right now, and especially to the people who really matter in terms of continued support and funding (wall street / institutional investors).  I absolutely am not recommending keeping it all in BTC.
I'm also saying 'diversifying' into crypto is bullshit, it's an illusion of diversification.  The entire asset class is correlated to BTC anyway.  Diversification means AVOIDING risk, which you don't do by diversifying into altcoins no one has heard of  hoping to make 50x your money, that's literally called gambling.  Again, if (near term, next 12 months or so) BTC dies the entire ecosystem other than maybe Eth or LTC go with it.  Literally 95%+ (likely 99%+) of all crypto projects will ultimately go bankrupt.
Diversifying would be moving a large chunk of your money into equity markets, real estate, other commodities, bond market, real assets that produce, etc., not other crypto.

People who are at retirement age should absolutely not be touching crypto... there’s no need to bear that risk even without the technological ability gap. 
Edit;  just to clarify - there have been TONS of stories on forums recently of people’s grandparents etc wanting to get into crypto and getting scammed from social engineering hackers or simply investing in scam coins with similar name to BTC (technological gap). There is a HUGE gap between understanding how to functionally use consumer tech and how to properly handle digital wallets, keys, transaction functionality, etc., for people of any age. 
To further clearing I meant people living off of their retirement. I.e. the average retiree in America who essentially has enough to retire but not much to speculate with outside of that.  Obviously if people have excess retirement funds they can do whatever they want with them. If anyone is trying to make up a retirement shortfall with crypto you’re an idiot and should pull the funds right now.  I am a huge crypto supporter but literally all we’ve seen is parabolic price increases, we will see brutal pullbacks eventually and I legitimately worry about people’s financial security.

Eth and BCH both do exactly what you mentioned, just significantly better and cheaper.  Hell even LTC does currently. 
 Not to mention that Eth has the ability to serve as a platform for any form of dApp in the future.  Currently BTC isn't even usable as a transaction medium due to the absurdly slow transactions and high fees.  You literally could not buy a cup of coffee (economically) with BTC.

Also just bothered to read a single sentence in your post and you clearly have no idea how even the basics of the banking system function.  Cool story.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:18:08
You do realize how definitionally idiotic your statement is unless you live in Venezuela or a few other hyper inflationary countries in the world, right?
You’re also confusing Bitcoin with Blockchain.  The ‘a large part of the worlds wealth’ will absolutely not be in bitcoin because BTC was never built to work that way.  They will very likely be on the/a blockchain, but it very likely will not be BTC’s. There are much better alternatives for digitized assets.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:25:10
This is also incorrect.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:23:54
You don’t need to borrow securities to short on a future, you can naked sell as many contracts as the exchange will let you.  It won’t directly impact Gemini’s price in CBOE’s case (as in, your specific short wont) but arbitrageurs will ensure that the impact is felt almost simultaneously.  There’s already substantial algo trading done in crypto, this is a perfect application for it.  These funds will literally be printing riskless money. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:21:53
Yeah... I’m not arguing it isn’t a speculative bubble that has made people rich. I’m clearly demonstrating why it’s a poor store of value. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:40:07
Everyone here vastly underestimates the amount of capital interested in shorting crypto.  This is not necessarily s good thing. 
Also hilarious that s product/community founded on decentralization and a hate for regulation is so stoked to be heavily regulated by various government agencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:26:33
I didn’t say that their sole purpose in life is to make you rich, but a side effect to their goals as a company has been continued exponential growth (more importantly in users than price) in BTC. Again, you should write them a thank you card.

Whether you were right or not is irrelevant. Would you have alerted me to this fact if you’re wrong?  Regardless you’re absolutely not a futureS (there’s an S at the end, you keep writing future) trader. Unless you mean you’re a time traveler, which at least means you’re just memeing.

@_date: 2017-12-20 21:26:23
Yeah... completely legal. Welcome to crypto.  These markets are UNREGULATED therefor insider trading statutes do not apply. They also do not apply to Forex markets and are very hard to enforce in the bond market. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:57:52
BTC is not a currency.  It was designed to be, but it is most definitely not a currency and has not been for years.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:28:48
No, people are insane.  I guarantee you at the most only 30-40% of everyone currently holding crypto could even explain to you what it is.  The craze has hit grandma level and truck driver level and stripper level.  The absurd rush to buy BTC in the past several months has driven primarily ignorant buyers jntk the market. Everyone who actually knows what it is already owned it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:42:12
This is a really stupid and dangerous way to look at it. Jobs don’t randomly lose 30% of their value.  Expecting this to be something as steady as an hourly increase borders on insane. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:00:18
I honestly think we’ll see price appreciation, or at a minimum price stability, until Sunday. All bets are off once futures go live. It’s way too beautifully simplistic to pull off the short if they’re intending to, and it won’t be possible on the 18th when CME goes live, but if there really is institutional money (large guys like fidelity etc, not hedge funds) looking to go long you could see continued positive momentum out of Sunday.  Keep in mind this is one man’s opinion, don’t follow it blindly. 
I honestly see perfectly viable cases for a flash crash Sunday and a sustained rally, it’s just very hard to predict the magnitude on both sides to decide which one wins. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:25:31
“Insider trading” is literally not applicable to crypto, it legally IS NOT a crime. He’s not wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:34:20
The community also needs to understand that BTC is no longer Bitcoin in the context of what Satoshi created. Btc has become a meme (‘gold 2.0’) even the Winklevoss brothers refer to it as such. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:24:37
What is their to say to that idiotic tweet?  The crypto community may very well be the greediest community on the planet (in terms of monetary gain and pure gambling/speculation driving everything).  Wealth under crypto is WAY more concentrated than under fiat.  This isn't the occupy wall street movement, this is 'allow a very small number of crypto holders to become hundred million - billionaires' movement.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:30:32

Sorry you’re a moron redditor for 2 days. This point just isn’t going to get through. There are LOTS of things in the world with less than 21mm in circulation, it doesn’t mean they’re worth anything. Best of luck.

@_date: 2017-12-07 20:02:46
I like the attempted use of a lot of financial terms. Unfortunately I’m not really sure you know what they mean. These are cash settled futures. Actual BTC supply and demand (in terms of having a max of 21mm coins)  is literally irrelevant in terms of delivery on the futures contract, because there is no delivery.  It’s purely cash, all the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:44:22
You’re going to get your dick ripped off.  Shorting ahead of Sunday is a very bad idea unless it is a very short term trade.

You’ve outperformed Buffet?  How much crack did you smoke today?  
Do you have any idea how absurd his track record is and how absurdly long he has sustained it?  You didn’t do shit. You gambled on crypto for two years with almost literally no money put in (especially on a relative basis). That isn’t consistent sound investment decision making that you’re executing day in and day out, that’s Pre-seed investment level risk taking that got lucky.  
Your analogy is garbage but you’re clearly financially inept and arrogant so I shouldn’t expect anything else.

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:55:12
They didn’t ‘know’ anything, it would’ve been a logical guess on their part that once Coinbase starts trading something it’s price will go up. It’s still a gamble either way. 
This isn’t equity markets where you learn that a company is going to beat their earnings announcements by 50% and the stock is guaranteed to shoot up.  That is (one of the many) reason why insider trading statutes are not applicable.

Dude... you have literally no idea how financial markets work. I’ve explained this like 25 times on this sub. Just because got can post the stat sheet from the futures contracts doesn’t mean you have any idea what it means. Just because the futures are cash settled DOES NOT MEAN IT WONT AFFECT THE UNDERLYING BTC PRICE, IT ABSOLUTELY WILL.  Arbitrageurs will ensure there is a DIRECT and nearly IMMEDIATE price impact on the exchanges.

Just FYI this stat is horribly incorrect because of the way exchanges work.  Coinbase definitely has 13mm users and i'd bet AT LEAST 70% of them have at least 1 usd on their accounts.  Due to pooled wallets you wouldn't even see this if they keep their money on the exchange.  (Rinse/repeat this logic for every exchange wallet in existence).

This is such a stupidly uneducated reddit edgelord comment. 
Buffet is a trained value investor (and by far the most successful) and bitcoin is literally worth $0 if you were to analyze it from a value investors perspective. There are $0 assets, there are $0 cash flows, done.  He’s (in his mind) legitimately trying to protect people from losing a lot of money.  Just because someone doesn’t understand the tech (he’s 87 years old, give the man a break) doesn’t mean they can’t try to alert people to the legitimate dangers they see during this absolutely astronomical (and PURELY speculative) price surge.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:10:00
I guarantee you this is not the case, and that less than 30% of the bitcoin holder base has any idea how it works.  Outside of buying it on Coinbase and watching the price go up. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:38:31
Or take Eth and be on the safe side. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:33
No they don’t. They have to have cash on hand as margin requires. Please don’t spout nonsense if you don’t know what you’re talking about.  You can offset a futures position by taking the opposite end of another trade. There are zero requirements of hedging in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:06:31
Yes I’m well aware. The bond market is a $100 trillion market, by cap, not volume. Volume would be orders of magnitude higher.  Let me correct the statement “A SINGLE one of these institutions manages 24x the capital of bitcoins market cap”, does that make the point any less significant?  Total BTC cap is a literal drop in the bucket. It can easily be pushed around. Point stands. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:11:33

I’m all fairness 95% of BTC holders are entirely ignorant and know nothing about crypto. This has only been pushed in the media the past few days that BTC is literally unusable. The rest of us have known this forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:04:15
You realize BTC is not even relevant to the world financial system right?  It has become a rare commodity to be HODLed for dear life, and that’s about it.  You can not readily transact in BTC and you’ll never be able to (because their are already significantly better options, even in crypto). 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:47:13
I'm not sure why you're so confused here?  Also wtf does apple have to do with anything?  Equity markets as a whole are a tiny fraction of the global financial markets.  Forex alone is $5.3 TRILLION in volume per DAY.  Bond market in aggregate is well in excess of $100 TRILLION dollars.  Apologies but I'm not sure why you're struggling.  Blackrock manages $6 TRILLION,  Fidelity manages $2.5 TRILLION, Vanguard manages $4.5 TRILLION (just to name a few), what's the issue again?

@_date: 2017-12-04 20:41:09

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:31:30
It has gone down 25% in 2 weeks while the r st of the crypto market has seen a net $100bn in flow. Clearly new  capital is no longer interested in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:02:43
How stupid are you?  The CBOE contract is tiny, only 412 BTC have been traded.  18th is what matters.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:41:22
That doesn't make the impact any less significant.  This happens ANY TIME YOU BUY BTC.  When you buy BTC guess what?  Someone just sold it to you!  That's exactly what is happening on Futures as well.  When someone sells you their BTC it's because they no longer believe it's worth the price you're paying for it and no longer think it's going to appreciate.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:36:31
You cannot have insider trading in unregulated securities. This sub is so pathetically desperate to jump all over this because you’re all so ignorant and blind and feel threatened bc BTC is useless aside from being a ‘Store or value’.

@_date: 2017-12-13 20:33:18
Yeah because BTC is a store of value instead of a currency now so why would you use it in a transactional nature?  This subs Jekyll and Hyde issues are best with popcorn. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:48:08
You can't legitimately say "crypto is not a bubble" and "stocks are absurdly priced" in the same sentence... lets get real.
Also the fee issue is a result of BTC currently being garbage at scale, has nothing to do with anything you mentioned.  This is a legitimate scaling issue.  Not a 'let me fear monger a bunch of unrelated shit so I sound smart' problem.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:59:33
Do I even need to do the basic math required to show you how bad of an assumption continued exponential growth is?  The most insane BTC forecasts by actual investors are $40k, or 300-400% growth, or 25% of the 2017 rate. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:18:06
Oh really?  Explain to me, what is bitcoin backed by in a financial terms?  Nothing is the correct answer. Bitcoin gives you the rights to... literally nothing by owning it. There’s no supporting asset.

Yeah ignore all logic and throw your money away!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:49:29

Are you trying to tell me that a crypto token represents an equity stake in a public company thus qualifying it to fall under insider trading statutes that make it illegal to insider trade...?

@_date: 2017-12-04 17:47:28
It’s more likely it was a long slow accumulation by hedge funds wanting to short the futures.  If you short $250m of futures on Sunday and sell $50m of BTC into Gemini right after you’ll absolutely obliterate the price (literally hitting a circuit breaker almost immediately) and probably make  a billion+ dollars in a day depending on your leverage. 
The crypto community vastly underestimated how much money is interested in shorting BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:38:58
I'm a condescending jackass because you're unable to understand how cash settled futures work...?  Your explanation is pure nonsense.  The market here cannot hit a 'supply crunch', you have some weird mental block here.  I'm not sure why you're having such a hard time understanding this.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:13:13
You guys are completely misunderstanding the point of this options trade.  Someone has given someone else the right to buy his or her bitcoin at $50,000 a coin by the end of 2018.  If this DOESN'T happen they still get to keep the premium from selling the options.  If it DOES happen and BTC is miraculously above $50k by then presumably this person has a ton of BTC already and is way beyond needing the additional wealth.
This was a brilliant trade by whoever sold the options.

I gotta say, you really need to learn what a share represents (ownership, entitlement to cash flow and assets) and why it matters.  Tokens are vastly inferior in this regard.  They entitle you to nothing and are fundamentally worthless on their own.

I think you need to learn how blockchains work.  They’re absolutely not dependent on BTC. Most large companies, especially in the financial industry, have non BTC private chains. Eth is a very large public chain with zero reliance on BTC, want more examples?
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:19:35
Coinbase and kraken are 100% irrelevant for the tidal wave on Sunday. Only Gemini matters. That’s why it’s scary.   Also these markets are substantially more efficient than you give them credit for, check the price spreads across similar exchanges at any point in time. They’re generally quite tight, especially considering how time and $ intensive it is to move BTC around.  (Efficient is also not the correct term in this context, that’s referring to efficient market theory or the idea that all publicly available info is priced in, but that’s a totally different discussion). 
Hodlers are also pretty irrelevant in this case as well. If you’re ALREADY holding something (and are committed to holding) if anything you’re reducing demand and helping to lower the price by not actively buying. Those hodlers tend to have a large amount of their net worth in BTC, so the more the price falls the poorer they get, very few are intelligent enough or have the fortitude to buy when their net worth takes a 20-30% hit in a matter of minutes. 
But you are correct, ultimately of course there’s buying pressure. The problem is is that st 9k? 7k? 2k?  We’ve seen how quickly people fold on these quick 20% dips and those are started just from small profit taking sales. I’m hoping nothing big happens Sunday, but I’m certainly prepared if it does. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:09:18
No.  BTC is essentially useless in its current state (for any realistic transactions).  That's why people call it a "store of value" because it's WAY too transactionally expensive for use and that's a better meme.  Currently the infrastructure does not validate the price at all, just memes and peoples hope for the future.
If BTC is processing 3 transactions per second in the future it should be worth $0 because there will be significantly better alternatives in the market (there already are... but thats a different debate).
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:34:26
Technically $250mm short requires ~25,000 contracts (depends on BTC price at the time). The contracts are single sized, not negotiable.  Will the market have that much liquidity?  I would absolutely assume so but we’ll have to see. 
Keep in mind, doing this would still be very dangerous.  An equally large or larger fund could just sit on Gemini soaking up all your sell orders resulting in very little price movement, but that would essentially have to be premeditated or a coordinated effort to keep the price stable. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:31:25

@_date: 2017-12-08 12:06:17
Yeah you're completely wrong.  "they" aren't calculating anything, it's a computer.  They're processing over $1.5 billion dollars a day in bitcoin transaction volume, why is your $16k so special that they are taking special time out to make sure you got the wrong price?  Slippage happens 100% on market orders even in liquid markets (although a few cents) when you're hitting market orders on bitcoin the price can literally move $2k before your order executes at this point.

It is an unregulated security. Therefor insider trading statues do not apply. They also do not apply to Forex markets, they are VERY difficult to enforce in the bond market. Pretty much JUST equities to protect the average investor who knows nothing through.... ding ding ding that anti crypto word, regulation!
Also knowing ahead of time when Coinbase will list BCH is STILL a gamble, you’re ASSUMING the price goes up.  It’s a huge deal in equity markets because of a company is going to beat earnings by 50% and someone knows that ahead of time there is a 100% probability that the stock WILL go up. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:35:43
I don’t think you understand what ‘value’ means. Those are all sunk costs, not value. (And if you really did that analysis you’re suggesting BTC would likely be worth $50-$500 max... which isn’t the point I think you wanted to be making, that it’s essentially worthless compared to the current price).

What?  That’s DAILY TOTAL VOLUME ACROSS ALL EXCHANGES GLOBALLY. That’s not Gemini minute volume.  Gemini did $118m in 24 hours. CBOE’s price is determined EXCLUSIVELY by Gemini’s BTC price. 
If you dump 50m on an exchange that thin the price will absolutely collapse, which then collapses all leveraged longs and forces them to liquidate, which forces all the idiots who have no idea what’s going on to panic sell, which leads to more weak handed panic selling. Btc selloffs are hysterically predictable because the majority (people, not $ value) have no idea what they’re doing and no financial/trading experience. 
If you sell HALF OF THE DAILY VOLUME of anything in one go it will absolutely obliterate the price.

Ok, we can just agree that you have no idea what you're talking about.  Fair enough.
You can sell futures to short, you can sell futures to hedge a current position, you can sell futures to hedge against incoming BTC that you're planning to accept as means of payment as a business or as a vendor just like with any other currency or commodity, you can use futures to lock in payment values of payments you are making using BTC (i.e. paying with BTC but don't want to miss out on price appreciation) you can use futures to lock in specific profit levels you are aiming for with BTC, need I go on?  There are FAR more use cases for futures than shorting.

I mean this purely from a volatility perspective if you already have sufficient funds for retirement goals there’s literally no point in gambling it here.  I also specifically said ‘at retirement age’ and maybe should’ve specified ‘currently living off their retirement savings’. 
Obviously I’m assuming someone has enough to retire and break even. If people have excess funds do whatever you want, I’ve been advising friends and family to, at a minimum, allocate 1-5% to crypto for s long time.

The point is CBOE is a sleepy exchange (compared to CME, especially for futures) where no one accesses their website for anything other than contract specs (aka no one uses their website) it can probably barely handle 50,000 users at a time.

I’m sorry that you have zero understanding of futures markets and are unwilling to learn. Best of luck. I agree that it’s hilarious in that it takes out a core tenet of BTC (there is 0 supply limitations because futures are derivative contracts). 
Regardless it greatly enhances liquidity (the ability to buy and sell an asset for a reasonable market rate at any point in time with minimal fees) and reduces volatility because people can hedge their bitcoin holdings, which is the core purpose of futures contracts.  I realize you also seem to not understand what that means nor do you appear to have any interest in learning, so I’ll leave it st that. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:18:02
That's the funny thing about an unregulated exchange.  They can watch Gemini all they want, but they have no jurisdiction over it.

Bitcoin futures settled in cash are designed specifically for hedging purposes and to enhance market liquidity which reduces fees and reduces volatility. That is the entire purpose of futures markets.

BTC has been a horrible store of value. You’re equating a skyrocketing price with a good store of value, that’s a good scarce asset that’s in demand, not s good store of value.  Store of value implies your value is safe there, not that you might be up or down 20% by tomorrow morning. You want to know a year from now your 100,000 whatever’s are worth roughly 100,000 whatever’s, not that they might be worth 10x or 0.2x their current value.

The 'getting rekt' on futures doesn't really apply, it will be mainly institutional investors who absolutely know what they're doing, especially when CME is live.  If retail investors are entering the futures markets... well then best of luck, they will get destroyed long or short.

No they dismiss it as a currency because it is a commodity.
Bitcoin is not easily transferable (backlog is gigantic) bitcoin is a horrible store of value (literally the most volatile semi-mainstream financial asset on the planet) and it is very expensive to transact in BTC.  Until all of these issues are fixed it will be treated as a commodity.

No t won’t.. are you retarded?  You’re talking about ‘decimating’ trillions of dollars of assets for a bump in BTC. I’m fairly certain no one in this thread even knows anything about financial markets or basic valuation. The hilarious part is a ‘crash’ in the stock market is basically what happens to BTC on the downside on a bad day.  When someone finally decides to sell crypto market is going to get real ugly.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:34:32
What you are calculating is the implied interest rate on BTC. The assumption is if you did what you’re proposing or just owned a BTC the outcome would be identical the date the futures contract expires.

I appreciate the well thought out approach to your answer, just wanted to clarify that what I said is in no way refuting what you said.
Bitcoin cannot grow AT THIS RATE in the future.  
Bitcoin will have grown by (roughly) 1,500% in 2017 assuming prices are moderately up by year end.  If Bitcoin were to increase 15x in 2018 we would be at $168,750 per coin by 12/31/18.  If we continued at this rate through 2019 we would be at $2,531,250 PER COIN by 12/31/19.
I'm not saying Bitcoin cannot or will not grow from here, of course it will, but it cannot grow AT THIS RATE into the future because that is literally impossible.  Bitcoin would be worth over $43 TRILLION by 2019, which is nearly  half of US GDP.
Growth will absolutely slow into the future.  If adoption continues at this rate growth will easily outpace equity markets and likely many (if not all) other options but it will grow at a significantly slower pace than it has historically.  So far even the most bullish predictions for 2018 put you below 400% annual growth, or roughly 25% of the growth rate of 2017.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:33:29
It was 1-3% at the time of my comment.  Even an 8% dip is literally nothing, this is crypto.  Very normal volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:29:30
You’re making the really ignorant assumption that the $8,000 price increase on relatively minimal news in the past 8-9 months isn’t a direct result of these firms buying. 
Only one exchange matters (in this case) because it is the only exchange CBOE is using to determine what price their futures are based on. CME relies on 4 exchanges but that isn’t relevant as they wont be live on Sunday. 
And before you say something stupid like ‘lol Wall Street hardly even knows what BTC is and wouldn’t have been buying until right now’ DRW (very large prop shop and market maker in Chicago) has been mining, trading and brokering trades since I believe early 2014.  All even semi relevant funds are well aware.

@_date: 2017-12-06 07:29:26
Well yeah... but if BTC literally went to $0 any shorts would make absolutely disgusting amounts of money off of it.  For BTC to actually die it means the tech is just garbage/worthless.  You can't short a market this size to $0 because it's already cash flow negative and people don't care.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:36:52
You're confusing people buying it with adoption.  They are not the same thing.  BTC is being massively hoarded globally, but still has hardly any institutional adoption or use.

Arbitrage.  Futures will directly impact Gemini's price in real time.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:47:23
Please read my first post for your answer.  But you are correct, in order to do this you would have to already hold the BTC on Gemini, the CME contract is actually irrelevant (in this portion of the analysis).  I’ve said a few times it’s quite likely that the meteoric rise in BTC of $8k+ in the last 6-8 months is probably driven at least partially by funds slowly building up positions. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:04:24
Not even close. You’re already holding, you don’t have dry powder. People are HOLDING 200bn of BTC, that says nothing of any remaining cash. Many asset managers are in the multi trillions already, it’s literally not even close.

Firstly, I am incredibly sorry for your loss.  That's absolutely awful.
Secondly, people need to understand money doesn't actually matter.  It's great and you can work less or not work or whatever you think you're going to do.  But you're still the same person you already are with or without money.  Focus on your own happiness and find out what makes you happy in your life (it isn't money, I promise) and pursue that.  If you also happen to become wealthy or work really hard and get there, great, but pursuing wealth in and of itself is an incredibly empty pursuit for a life.

Coinbase is one of the only actually reputable exchanges out there, especially for fiat -&gt; crypto trades. Contact their support.  They’re on boarding literally hundreds of thousands a week at this point and everyone has known all exchanges are very backed up for at least s month now. Do some basic research. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:13:13
Except the broader market isn’t really in a bubble, especially if you look at crypto, then it isn’t to an absurd degree.  The combined market cap and losses of all cash flow negative businesses that are publicly traded is completely negligible vs the overall market.

He’s wrong, but enjoy your ignorance. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:05:58
I think you misread my post.  Your USDT point is likely valid btw. 
You would be short on the futures side because it is VERY easy and economical to do so. You would be selling (simply selling, not shorting) in very large volumes on Gemini (the only exchange that’s relevant for CBOE) which would drop the price.  As Gemini’s price drops you make money from your futures short because that price is reflected in the futures price.  
Given historical behavior in BTC you’ll cause a raft of panic selling and the price will buckle and then you cash out your limit down futures and buy back the BTC on Gemini at much lower prices than you sold it for.
Again this is all theoretical, I don’t know of anyone planning to do this and am not even sure if it could be done.  I hope it moons and the futures are a net benefit, I just want to raise awareness of what’s possible. 
In VERY simplistic terms it’s currently super easy to buy BTC and pretty difficult to short BTC and even them only in limited volume, that dynamic changes on Sunday.

So much has gone right in the last 6 months that was entirely out of his control. 
Also ‘track record’ is not s thing because BTC doesn’t do anything to generate value. You just mean it has a continuously more aggressive adoption for speculative purposes.

Oh trust me, people have thoroughly proven to me that there is about 0-5% understanding of basic finance from an average user on this forum.  You cannot 'understand investing a lot' and have 'bitcoin' in the same sentence.  I love crypto, I really do, but it is fundamentally a GAMBLE.  This is not investing, this is a moonshot.  Has it worked out?  Absolutely.  Are there ANY financial basis for making an investment in it other than price appreciation?  Absolutely not in its current state nor the foreseeable future.  Do I still own it?  Of course.  Crypto makes up a reasonable portion of my overall asset allocation.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:12:12
Ok.  Well enjoy being ignorant.  They are literally settling millions of dollars a trade a second.  There is no calculation built in to automatically rip off their customers.  'Positive slippage' would be paid out just as well, but it means the price is tanking and you got executed on the way down.  You wouldn't notice because you'd still be pissed that you're losing money.  
TL;DR - Stop crying and use gdax or another exchange where you can use limit orders.

You’re right, someone is always on the other side, but they could be hedging coins they hold or offloading to another broker.  Just because someone takes the other side doesn’t mean the price isn’t affected. Every time you buy a BTC someone had to sell to you for the price you bought it at.

I own BTC, but honesty BTC is bad for third world countries in its current form.

TIL people in cryptoland think Chase is a bank. (It isn’t. JP Morgan owns Chase as their retail arm).  And again to all you idiots banks are not shorting equities nor do they give a shit about crypto, they are certainly not shorting it.

It IS a bubble.  There's literally NO arguing against that.  But that doesn't mean the ride is even close to being over.  Arguing that something that can move like this based on NOTHING is not a bubble is just pure idiocy.  What changed between yesterday and today?  Bubble mania.  Absolutely no underlying change (other than backlog of transactions getting even more clogged) and price goes up $1,500.
Bitcoin generates negative cash flow and is currently more valuable than the majority of profitable companies on the planet.

I’m not sure what you’re asking?  It’s very easy for a $50mm-$1bn fund to place a tiny bet (100k - $1mm) on something like BTC because of how cheap the coins were at the time and the insane leverage you get if any real price appreciation occurs. 
Hedge funds are incredibly intelligent investors, they aren’t going to move the price on themselves.  Very realistic to slowly buy up a position of that size.

Yes you should tell her, unfortunately you also should’ve told her years ago.   Best of luck.  Also ignore everyone saying to hold it forever.  
If you actually want to own a home and remove that worry from your life (rent, mortgage payments, etc) then cash out a portion and do it.  Especially considering the relatively small annual income vs total net worth, that would provide a lot of peace of mind. 
Your wife quitting her job or not is much more a character thing.  Help her find a job she actually enjoys with similar pay (full time job minimum wage is ~$20k annually so theoretically she can maintain the same earning power across a fairly wide option of jobs).

I think most people who do not work in the financial industry have a really hard time separating investment professionals / asset managers from investment banks.  
When most people say "wall street" they are referring to investment banks (JPM, GS, MS, BAML, etc) which still only have internal testing done for both blockchain and crypto trading environments.  In this case "most on wall street did not see bitcoin as a reasonable investment" is correct, however investment banks are not investors, so it's kinda a moot point.
If you're referring to "wall street" as all global investment professionals then I think we're pretty far off.  Funds with these kinds of resources prey on volatility and (no offense to the crypto community) very unsophisticated investors.  DRW has done over $20bn in BTC trading since 2013, for example.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:36:56
That’s not entirely true.  Twitter is finally turning into a passable public company after being awful for years. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:47:45
There are volatility breakers in all futures markets, with 20% swings up or down resulting in trading shutting down for the day.  Also short stops at 7 and 15% (I believe, levels may be slightly different) for the BTC futures.  
The goal is to reduce volatility... personally I think breakers will be hit many times a week until there’s a much larger asset manager base in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:49:05
Ok can we end the absurdly uneducated circle jerk here?  Holy shit.  First of all BANKS CANNOT SHORT SECURITIES.  They have not been able to since 2007.  Secondly banks don’t give a shit about crypto (other than obviously valuable BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY (which is irrelevant to whether BTC = $1 trillion or $0)) and are NOT shorting or investing in crypto coins at all.

Very likely possible with an options spread assuming they underestimate BTC volatility, which is possible, if they get it right then no not really.

What?  You can buy a single share which for the vast majority of public companies is $5-$100 range.  You can’t even transact in BTC below $10 at this point and you’d get hit with buying and selling fees on top of that.

I’m just going to assume you’re quite dense considering how inapplicable that analogy is. 
It WOULD be applicable if there was a global community fervently pushing a new standard for record keeping and had a vested financial interest in it.  Coinbase has enabled the global mass adoption of a technology you presumably believe to be superior to and a revolutionary leap from the current systems in place.  It has also made you incredibly wealthy under the assumption that you have been around bitcoin for at least, I don’t know, a whole two months?  People on reddit are shockingly ignorant and short sighted. Stop trolling and pandering to the circle jerk and use your brain. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:59:46
There's a fairly extensive discussion of this in Digital Gold actually... not exactly a secret.  Generally speaking hedge funds thrive in illiquid environments.  The only hedge funds who need mass liquidity are algo based HFT funds, which is certainly not the majority.  You are able to take advantage of illiquid situations much more frequently than liquid ones because illiquidity creates uncertainty and additional required returns to justify the risk of a less liquid security.  If you’re an HFT you’re transacting potentially thousands and thousands of times a day so you don’t care about the magnitude of each win, they’re just tons of tiny % gains that are virtually guaranteed to never lose money.

Oh really?  You heard about a cutting edge technology years after it entered mainstream from a super niche TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION VIEWER tv show?  Wow you’re super ahead of the curve.  I’m sure no one on Wall Street has an HBO subscription. 
My career has been in Silicon Valley. I assure you VCs were broadly unwilling to play with crypto, especially back then.  Fintech is something that many hedge fund boys and top traders understand better than most VCs because it is outside of where most VCs used to invest.  The bottom line is you actually have no idea what you’re talking about.  I live in both worlds and at least have reference points. 
Even more to your point most tech billionaires don’t care at all about BTC. They care about how blockchain tech can benefit the company(s) they run.  For some reason most redditors are still ignorant to the fact that the blockchain is valuable, bitcoin is absolutely not.

I’m very confused how you think there’s enough money in the crypto world to stop the street from breaking BTC to $0 in a day if people actually wanted to?  This would be one of the easiest and most profitable momentum trades in history.  
The only thing actually stopping this is the 20% circuit breakers on the futures.
