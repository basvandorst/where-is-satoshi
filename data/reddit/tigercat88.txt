I know but why are a handful of individuals / entities "in charge of" the subreddit, which should echo BTC values, why not just have a utopian community where everything goes?

disagree strongly. The subreddit echo's the value of BTC like a website would echo the values of a bank

I know but screw the other crypto's BTC is the grandaddy of em all and should continue to set the standard

I love bitcoin I really do. But you honestly think if it gets approved those professional investors with multi-millions care about filling our pockets. They can just aswell short the living sh!t out of Bitcoin and thus it can have the complete opposite effect as expected.Furthermore BTC price should already have accounted for a possible ETF approval since its now common knowledge. Should it get rejected though it can lead to a big drop in price.Anyway I may or I may not be right, im an amateur the above is just my 5 cents worth...I just dont think its all moon shine and roses and that simple as you and many others make it out to be.

Yeah I kinda get that I was just curious whether their allegations carry any weight. Everything has something bad attached to it and you dont see many bad things (i.e. constructive criticism) on here though, or maybe I just missed it (which is likely)  
But allow me to play devils advocate. Why do we need Moderators for reddit bitcoin if the whole idea (or atleast how I interpret BTC) is FREEDOM. Whether that freedom is transaction or speech.   
Just my thoughts
