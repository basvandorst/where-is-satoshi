Not remotely true. There is hardly any alt coins growing right now. And the ones that are, are still down for the month. Nothing is hitting ATH’s while bitcoin is down. As soon as bitcoin becomes Bullish than alt will grow.

It’s not a bank atm, it’s a machine to buy bitcoin and dash with fee positive ( they pay you) fees. They just call it a atm

 No there’s not. Don’t be ignorant about things you don’t know.

Lol down vote me all you want. I live in Portsmouth and go here. The atm doesn’t charge fees, in fact it’s fee positive, it pays you to use it. 
Don’t be ignorant. 
They are wealthy guys spreading information

They don’t charge fees on things. They aren’t profit motive, they are trying to educate.

This place is cool. Like 20 minutes from my alma matter, UNH. The entire town of Portsmouth is very crypto friendly in fact.

Not even remotely true. Just because it’s common doesn’t mean it’s what’s practiced here.
