The time to buy is when there's blood in the streets.

The main problem with Roger Ver is that he's using his vast personal wealth to influence the outcome of things; how in the world does that align with the concept of decentralization? He portrays himself as someone with such lofty ideals yet he acts like a spoiled rich kid throwing money at people to get what he wants.

I don't know, I see more red than green.

Yet Google Trends search results for 'Bitcoin' remain flat. A nice spike would be encouraging.

My guess is that institutions will provide the next catalyst.

That red candlestick "I" ruins the sentiment.

I would hope that anyone cashing out on that much Bitcoin would replace it. Even if the merchant allows payment in BTC they'll waste no time converting it to fiat, creating downward pressure on the price either way.

I do this often, especially at a few restaurants in my area that have stopped accepting cash entirely. I usually get a pause and then a confused look. It is fun to see the reaction. Also, whenever I get a Square merchant receipt emailed to me I always leave a comment saying "Please accept Bitcoin".

If all Tesla does is convert the Bitcoin into fiat then the effect would be negative for BTC. If instead Tesla pays its employees in BTC that's a real step in the right direction.

I think Coinbase blew an excellent opportunity to create awareness of BTC. They could have printed "Bitcoin" or at least the Bitcoin logo on their crypto debit card. Instead they opted for an utterly generic looking card that looks more like a hotel pass-key.
