Yes it is, however the majority of Europe follows Germany's lead on many matters and we clearly share the same beliefs. Time will tell however some good educated pressure in the right places can help to obtaining favorable outcomes with regards to recognizing Bitcoin as a financial instrument thus making it sales tax free.

There are maximum limits on the amount that can be purchased with these accounts, to limit our exposure. What we are doing is providing people with a small step into the world of Bitcoin and reducing the risk on the customer. You may believe that every man woman and child should just adopt Bitcoin however the reality of what is going to happen will be taken in small steps.

I was expecting such a statement around the 23rd February, they have realised we are serious following the start of what is quickly becoming the marketing campaign of the year. We are not too fussed about their approach becuase we know they need to protect the banks. We will be releasing a statement of our own tomorrow or on Monday to get better coverage. They cannot regulate us and they do not like that one bit because they cannot stifle innovative competition against their dinosaurs. Luckily for us, the general public have seen these experts at work with their regulation skills, whilst their power only extends as far as the businesses they regulate.
The worst thing for them is that it has only just begun.

Bitcoin can never be centralised or used in just one location/country, but you can have hot beds of activity and why not here in Cyprus, where years of abuse by the status quo have been felt by many. We are already taking strides ahead of other places around the world in relation to Bitcoin adoption.

They should have arrested me last week when I was in Cyprus!!

@_date: 2014-01-26 09:29:30
There will be another update released soon. We are in talks with a multitude of potential  banks that we can purchase a significant stake in, this is why I may seem to be spending alot of time away from the island if you follow me on Twitter and also why I have been extremely pushed for time to make updates. We are doing this to reduce counter party risk. We do not want the scenario of having funds frozen or accounts closed etc. This will also enable us to earn additional revenue through the bank itself and we will hopefully be in a position to help other Bitcoin based businesses achieve solid connections to the traditional banking infrastructure. The next release will include an update on Easycoin and the Payment Service Providers we are working with. We are going to install the terminals and gateways with our large merchant before announcing anything to the world. It will make headlines that I am absolutely certain of.

@_date: 2014-01-23 04:32:29
I will take a picture of the branch in its current state just for you today, you must be getting CySec and the SEC mixed up. There is no licensing requirements here as there is in the US. However we are in the process of obtaining a CIF license that will enable us to offer so much more than we are currently permitted to do. Remember the US has a completely different (more awkward) legal system. The Easycoin platform is still going ahead. Finally I am personally trying to help Ukyo get everyone paid back what is owed to them, so he can then pay me what he owes me.

There is already a tax precedent within the EU set by Germany. Bitcoin is being treated as a financial instrument so it is sales tax free.

I left to return 5 days later. Funny how my return flight ticket never gets a mention. The fact I left with just enough clothes for 5 days and everything of mine was still in Cyprus including the Bitcoin I was holding for people, its also great how its never mentioned that they got their coins the moment I sent someone to recover the paper backups from.....Cyprus (right where I left them). The greatest part is how people expected me to return when multiple people gave interviews to the police in English, was expected to sign the statements which were written in Greek of which included "extra" facts. Fortunately for me they could read Greek.
So scared of anything? Far from it because like I said keyboard warriors. The person that thought it was a good idea to make a threat towards my daughter because they believed rumours, has much more to worry about than me.

It is nothing like that, we offer an option to redeem the Bitcoin in their wallet on the agreed date for their original buy-in price, if the price has fallen below their original purchase price. The cost of which this option is, a limit on POTENTIAL profits of an agreed percentage. The lengths of these offerings are initially 3 or 6 months. We do not guarantee the growth.

There is plenty of information available, it all came out over the last 3 year's following all the court cases. DYOR on that, I'm beyond fed up of explaining it to people that are as wide of the mark as you are.
As for the current state of affairs, private litigation is underway to hold those that made the false accusations against me and those that tried to blackmail me accountable. When all is complete any proceeds from that will be returned to those that backed Neo &amp; Bee. Also to add any personal profits from fastbitcoins are being added to the pool of funds enabling those that backed Neo to benefit from that too.

Why would you want to keep Bitcoin on the low unless your waiting for some cash to become available to you, so you can buy low and then cash out following the next round of massive over pricing. That's what your post sounds like to me, if everyone had the desire to further Bitcoins standing within the world, it would already be worth so much more. Too many people looking to make a quick buck then get out. This behavior gives Bitcoin the 2 steps forward, one step back reputation it has.

No we exchange the euros for BTC, put those BTC into the customers wallet and then when the price rises we rebalance the wallet to retain the original amount of Euros worth of BTC in their wallet and those BTC pass into our reserves. When the price goes down, we top up the customers wallet from our reserves.

You forgot to mention that people can offer goods and services in return for Bitcoin as another point of entry to the Bitcoin economy.
Ask them if they have friends in countries that are cut off financially from the rest of the world due to politics! They could play the game if they accepted Bitcoin.
In 10 years they could very well be saying to themselves "Damn maybe I should of been more welcoming to the idea"
The game itself would increase its user base too just purely from the new users Bitcoin acceptance would generate.

We would be operating on a cash only basis, however this scenario is extremely unlikely considering we are proposing new regulations that are designed specifically for Bitcoin, so we will be fully compliant in the eyes of the law.

Sorry the first coffee of the morning hasn't had the desired effect yet.
We have investigated (and still are investigating) the possibility of implementing a dual use card "Pisti &amp; VISA/Mastercard" that would allow its use at any location or ATM.

@_date: 2013-11-17 18:07:31
Initially we are focusing on the Cypriot market, we need to walk before we run. Also should we open the gates to the whole of the EU from the outset, we will create backlogs for AML/KYC procedures resulting in a poor customer experience, something we want to avoid at all costs.
Yes that is what the insurance will provide, the cost will be built into the service fees depending on the type of wallet you choose.

**Everything can be modified as long as the collective agrees (51%+ Miners) Clients like electrum are already very popular. Whilst the mining is not operated by a centralized unit then it will remain decentralized**


**mBTC will become the norm and you will hark back to the days when full BTC's were used, when this becomes the accepted norm those new to the world of Bitcoin will not know any difference.**


**The majority of future users will have their wallets managed for them (whether people agree with this or not), it will happen and it may even get to the point where the end user doesn't fully know that their money is being sent/stored via the blockchain. This scenario will make the knock on effects exactly the same as the "gun to the head scenario and the ATM" that you mention. People shouldn't keep all their funds in one wallet readily available and services that manage your holdings will ensure they are not all in one wallet (one would hope so anyway).**
@_date: 2013-08-10 09:24:35
Not unless they buy up huge quantities, but with every Bitcoin purchased they would require more funds to do so, following the principles of supply and demand. They cannot demand or take a large quantity of Bitcoin by force.
@_date: 2013-08-10 09:01:05
There is no financial input required to obtain Bitcoins, you can go right ahead and use 5 minutes of your time to do a service for someone and get paid in Bitcoins. Your new input to the economy hasn't made it worth more, thus not increasing the size of the "pyramid" but increasing the size of it's user base. The early adopters are the ones who showed faith in the protocol and should be rewarded for the risks they took. Just like everything, the price is based on supply and demand with no promise of returns.
If I buy gold today at price x and tomorrow nobody wants it and can't give it away, have I been the victim of a Ponzi/Pyramid scheme?

Are the prices of the hydroponic supplies tied to the exchange rate of Bitcoin or are they permanently fixed in Bitcoin? The Pisti network will calculate the amount of BTC the purchase is and move the funds in BTC to the merchants account so it doesn't take the BTC &gt; FIAT &gt; BTC path, the amount of BTC sent is determined by the exchange rate.

Time based deposits, when we offer these following the launch will offer interest payments. With interest rates at the lowest possible rate within the traditional banking system the lack of interest on any instant access account is not a huge barrier to overcome when you consider the benefits of what we shall be offering.

Absolutely certain we wont have any problems.
@_date: 2013-07-19 08:31:57
The bail-in's only occurred with the banks that needed the money, because we would adhere to the principles of full reserve banking that shall never be the case, but it is an interesting point that we had considered whereby providing a clear and simple contingency plan for our depositors is something that we are going to implement.
The hedging strategy is being planned and continually adjusted by our analysts/traders and will ensure that the banks reserves do not take a critical blow should the Bitcoin exchange rate drop below a certain threshold. We also have the possibility of a monthly fee for pegged instant access accounts that would provide an insurance for those accounts (although a fee sounds crazy, in Cyprus traditional current accounts are loaded with hidden service charges and it is still impossible to use a competitors ATM without incurring a €2.50 charge).
@_date: 2013-07-19 14:25:49
That will always depend on the market at the time and will be subjected to constant review. I am not going to throw theoretical numbers around until we are offering the products or in the position to start offering the products to our depositors. Sorry I couldn't provide a better answer.

If Bitcoin is $1 on the public markets, it does not lose its utility and all the BTC will be here in Cyprus where local supply and demand would dictate its value.

That is my aim in Cyprus, I was making plans before the crisis hit but it is a major venture and needs careful diligent planning to ensure security and success. You may have seen my post giving the outline of the project but my sole aim is to get mass adoption of Bitcoin locally. 1200 Clients in the first year is my target and that would essentially be 1200 local new Bitcoin users.

I think the point Todamont was making (one that I assumed anyway) Who would borrow from a company that would lend 100BTC @ $100 and expect the Bitcoin price to rise by only 10% (something which year on year so far does not even scratch the surface as last year it rose 186%) that 100BTC could easily become worth $20,000. No one would take that loan on if they had serious intentions of paying it back.

@_date: 2013-06-28 20:44:44
Personally I don't really care, Bitcoin is a 10 year + project not a 10 day project, speculators do nothing but overvalue the coins, this ensures that when the media want to bash Bitcoin they have the "but it dropped 50% in one day line" this only happens because speculators pump their money in, realize it doesn't double or triple their money within 48 hours all the time then panic sell. Year on year shows a much better representation of Bitcoins increases in value.

Thanks for the questions
1) We will hedge using a wide range of investments of our own funds, we will also be adding a lot of liquidity to the market which will benefit the exchange rate. A service charge is common ground here in Cyprus on Bank accounts which I have mentioned in previous comments.
2) The bail-ins occurred at the banks that needed the money, something we will not be subject too. Also we will not have direct access to the funds held by our depositors without the depositor providing an input. Initially because of the ECB's stance on the status of Bitcoin as a currency we do not require a license to operate. However if this does change we will be in a position to comply immediately. We have also established channels of communication to ensure any regulations that are placed upon us are fitting for the purpose. They can send me to prison but they still wont have our depositors money and also as previously stated we will have contingency plans for our depositors to ensure that if such an event occurred they could take control of their own funds.

The red tape in Europe is somewhat less restrictive than in the United States because the European Central Bank does not recognize Bitcoin as "money" that is why the Minister of Finance in the Netherlands has openly stated they will not be regulating Bitcoin and the routes of exchange for the foreseeable future. The biggest problem I believe is the fact they cost between $4000 and $5000 each, coupled with the current usage level of Bitcoin is small the ROI is not that great.

Insurance related products and international money remittance. There is a large number of individuals that reside here in Cyprus that send money to developing countries, but that side of things is still very much under development. We are actively in talks with many people who are within Bitcoin and taking the fight to the likes of Western Union and those who have the infrastructure in these developing countries to act as a local Bitcoin exchange. When we have the exact facts and figures (and the exact scope of the operations) we will release them.

Unfortunately the general population here are not at the point where they would be willing accept the risk of the economy based solely on Bitcoins, that would be amazing in concept but it is not going to be a reality just yet and initially the deposits will be made using Euros. My personal opinion is that Bitcoin will not stabilize until the depth of the market increases, so in the meantime whilst that is happening all we can do is work within the parameters of what has the largest chance of success and benefits the depositors the most.

@_date: 2013-07-19 12:33:33
We have looked at other variations but when it is Bitcoin to Bitcoin based accounts the transactions are going to offer almost instant accessibility of the funds to the merchant where as through existing networks we would have an increased exposure to the current financial systems and it would take longer to make the funds available to the merchants.

Hi from Neo &amp; Bee, we are indeed working with the University and providing all the POS terminals and online gateways, their staff do not get paid in Bitcoin, however many of them are now Bitcoin holders. The local merchants that we are working with are welcoming us with open arms because we are driving down the cost of them accepting payments, even locally. We are the largest start-up in Cyprus right now, we are spending the most on marketing across the island, we have in excess of 30 employees working on the business full time and that is excluding the employees of KPMG and the Lawyers working on our business. We are taking huge steps everyday towards the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. The University is significant but it is only a small part of what we have achieved on the ground here.

Initially they will be, but during that period we will be adding large amounts of liquidity to the market. We will keep our strategies close to our chest. Our future offerings will include insurance products, lending and other financial related products to add additional streams of income.
On the topic of falls, we shall be operating our own index, which will be determined by many factors, insulating us from the immediate decline in the price. These declines will allow us to increase our BTC holdings whilst the local index adjusts.
Edit - From an investment point of view, we have had many people invest solely on the statement it sends to the traditional banks. We also firmly believe that we will be a success and the income derived from the price increases of BTC whilst we add large amounts of liquidity to the markets is a short term strategy.

Easyco.in is coming online soon, our licensed crypto portfolio management arm, Neo &amp; Bee Kenya, International remittance services etc. These all boost our own reserves to help in times like these theoretical scenarios.

Something I have been saying for ages and couldn't agree more. I have little time for people wanting to make 100% returns in 48 hours then cash out. 10 years not 10 days is how people should approach Bitcoin and it's still very early.

The "card" linked to the instant access accounts will enable people to pay for goods and services with any of our merchants. We wanted almost zero exposure to the existing banking infrastructure because that is one way the competition can squeeze you. So we are creating our own. We will be working in connection with a private bank that will enable SWIFT/SEPA payments that is not a direct competitor here in Cyprus.
We would welcome any customer that wants to utilize our services in a legal manner, but our marketing will be targeted at the average local person here in Cyprus and not at the existing Bitcoin community. We will always welcome existing Bitcoiners and we will have the functionality to send/receive Bitcoin directly to and from an account in the traditional manner.

That is one of the beauties of Bitcoin, once a "real" flaw is found, it is generally fixed within hours and the network becomes stronger for it, now compare to a fatal flaw in anything else, it would take meetings to plan meetings to get the requirements set out for the fix.

There is a spreadsheet that demonstrates the effect of such scenarios within the thread on Bitcointalk, it is also linked at the top of this post, I converted the spreadsheet into USD so people can use it to determine their own scenarios, it is published with the figures from the April crash, this demonstrates that although damaging such a crash during our first week, we would still be in business.
Edit to answer the second part - The biggest bank that is now merged with Laiki, are losing 10m in cash per day, with a €300 per day cash withdrawal limit in place. This has been occurring ever since they opened their doors again to the customers. €7.5m is tiny in comparison as to what cash is being removed from peoples accounts that reside here in Cyprus.

Thanks Vycid, thanks for the grilling! You have no idea how much I like to be questioned.
1) Already on to it, we fully understand that we need to make these markets, I have brought this process forward to enable earlier announcements. We won't be keeping any (electronic) Euro funds within Cyprus, by design we have zero exposure to the local banking infrastructure.
EDIT - Our design and structure ensures we cannot use our customers Bitcoins.
If you check throughout my postings on what we are offering, walking before running is my priority. We want solid foundations hence why I didn't rush to market by the end of April.
2) We already communicate openly with these influential people, these people are those that have faced the harsh realities of what happened here. They are wanting a solid alternative and that is what we are working hard towards providing.
I know the responsibility this carries for Bitcoin as a whole, we are here for the long run. This is mine and everyone else that is involved chance to leave a lasting positive impression on the world.

We didn't overlook them in the prospectus, insurance is well documented, the cash flow could be x or it could be y depending on several factors such as the model we use to execute the process and which partners we work with, if we decide to form strategic partnerships, so until that is determined we will not publish the findings, to be a long way from the projections once executed would not be the best idea.
There is much more in relation to Bee and Neo that is being actively developed, for example, a strong indication from a global brand that they will be accepting Bee payments when we launch, to name that company and claim them as a Bee merchant without a formal agreement would be both illegal and providing incorrect data to potential investors.

And this behavior is what holds back Bitcoin from achieving its true status, speculation is only for the short term. Adoption rates into new markets will have more long term benefits for it as a currency. Speculation overprices the currency and when it finds its real level only then will its real strength improve. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 00:48:21
People couldn't get funds out of MTGox for 2 weeks so most bought up Bitcoin on Gox and transferred out through another exchange and when panic sets in, all those expecting to double their money overnight panic and sell off too. That is why there was such a big difference in price on Gox compared to Bitstamp and BTC-e for 2 weeks.

Yes that is what the pegged wallets offer, we are adding stability for those wallets, so they can use the benefits of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange without anyone else having root access to their funds. For commerce to happen you need a stable platform.  We also have other wallets where people can use Bitcoin as a speculative asset at their own risk, we also have the pegged time based wallets where the customer will receive a percentage of any growth without exposure to downwards movements in the rate, the cost for the customer being that they agree to hoard those Bitcoin for a predetermined period of time. When this happens, less coins will be publicly available for speculation and we know internally when these coins will/may become available again.

I previously worked for 2 banks and that is my sentiment exactly, Bitcoin has plenty of exchanges unless its a P2P exchange there is no new innovation taking place, I am very luckily geographically (Within a Buffer Zone) to be able to start such a business, by the time it gains enough traction for anyone to take notice it will increase the strength of my hand when negotiating with the government should they attempt to make any regulations or taxes on the clients balances. Banks offer to pay you for holding your money because they lend it to people or invest the money. That part is not optional with traditional banks. With my venture any client funds used to fund lending would be at the consent of the client. 
You also have to remember that my clients have already had the government and banks take money from their bank accounts to pay for their failings.

Without legal precedent or guidelines, Bitcoin is not a recognised currency (money) within the UK. If the PM was to mention Bitcoin in general through a Q&amp;A session with the public, it would be a nice little achievement and further shows that it is gaining recognition at the highest level (regardless of political opinions that I don't wish to debate).

really if you wished to innovate and populate the marketplace for the good of the bitcoin economy, would it not be of greater benefit to fill that gap in the marketplace for a useable wallet for the "non" tech savvy.


Isn't the true idea of Bitcoin to separate itself from this self destructive world?


I'm good down to below $5, so couldn't care less if it doesn't hold at $88 because I can still transfer money across international and political borders for very low fees without having to line the pockets of banksters or have the funds frozen by a government that doesn't want the money to leave the country.

Isn't the illegal drugs market the second biggest market globally after oil? That is all based in fiat too. Yes wallets can be stolen, but so can FIAT and gold and diamonds.

There was also the idea of calling Neo, NUBA a word that would have been created specifically for us, you can make anything you want with those letters, one suggestion was 'Never Use Banks Again'

I came across this issue when mapping out the systems for my project. The client when in person can choose 4 random characters those 4 characters can then go towards generating a custom address. That way the client can see for themselves that only they have access to the private key, once the address has been generated, the wallet is printed then loaded in front of them. Also wiping the printer memory to prevent the keys being printed again from the printer memory is an important security factor.

Bitcoin will never completely replace FIAT that is a given, however it can improve its current market share.

That time is still someway off, but potentially anything is possible with regards to widespread acceptance.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:26:38

My plan is to bridge the gap between the average person in the street and existing Bitcoiners. The only way to do that is to offer products and systems the average person is accustomed too and make changes slowly. Here in Cyprus more people prefer to use a branch more than online banking. I also have the added benefit of the UN Buffer Zone where the first branch will be located as it falls outside of the jurisdiction of the Cypriot and Turkish governments.

Bitcoin is a technological innovation, that is a little like asking if the internet would be "right" for Cypriots. Cyprus is a modern western country with a technological infrastructure. Yes we are going to be changing behaviors and routines, but that process is going to be a slow one, introducing too many changes at once anywhere in the world would create more barriers than it beaks down, that is why our wallet solutions are no different for the customer than interacting with their current financial service providers, with the exception that they can check the block chain to see if their funds exist in their wallet, this enables them to see for themselves that we haven't taken their money and invested it or loaned it out.

We have had the ability to learn from the mess that is our traditional banking sector, that we have to be open and transparent with absolutely everything. They aren't buying into a fund, they are buying Bitcoin from our reserves, those Bitcoin get transferred into their wallet. For pegged accounts, when the price drops we use our own reserves to top their wallet up to ensure the Bitcoin held equates to their euro holdings. When it rises the difference is passed back into our reserves. We only trade with our own reserves to ensure we have enough BTC volume to cover any of these top-ups.

I think many people realize the benefits of Bitcoin once someone knowledgeable gives them the information. Many media outlets just spout of the same stories just with a different presenter and more relevant figures. Regulation is unavoidable, fighting the biggest gangs in the world will always be a battle but if they adapt to modern technology and accept they don't have the power they are used to exercising, then things can work out just fine in the long run of things. One highly placed politician to say "You know what this is a good idea because the current systems are failing (which is evident every time a bailout is mentioned)" and the ramifications for the Bitcoin economy will be nothing but positive in a whole.

The reasoning for the run on the banks was because of the confiscation of deposits, this was enabled because of the terms of which depositors are unsecured creditors to the bank. The local behaviors were not half as bad as the global media made it out to be. For a start the banks were closed so people had no option but the daily withdrawal limit at the cash machine. People here knew queuing up to the doors of each closed branch in the sun with no shade, was a pointless exercise. The biggest effect this has had on a very conservative nation is a distaste against those they invested their trust with, developing trust and understanding is our biggest objective on a marketing front. 
We will be managing a complex portfolio of futures and strategic relationships with currency trading resources to remain solvent and profitable under most volatility conditions. The finer details of which we will not publicize, as operating any other way will undermine any strategy. A good trader(s) will make gains under volatile conditions, irrespective of the direction of the movement.

You as an individual maybe welcoming of changing your routine habits when presented with an innovative technology, a higher percentage of people are not so welcoming of so many changes at once.

Thank you, the doubters are just as important at this stage as everyone that is providing the good feedback. We have a nation to convince that this is the future for them and we will face many more doubters before we become the first choice in banking solutions here. The Bitcoin ATM from Lamassu is currently a one way street into Bitcoin and we want our clients to use Bitcoin as much as possible on our own payment network, but ATM's have not been ruled out for the future.
The pre-paid cards that we offer generally for Tourists will have QR codes for direct BTC deposits, however the core of our depositors are not existing users of Bitcoin so they will have no use for the QR code to deposit.
With regards to the US law and opening an overseas account is something that will be established later on, we have to adhere to the law set out by each country and each jurisdiction and the requirements is different and our legal team requires time (and money) to research each jurisdiction.

Sorry I didn't answer the first part again briefly - because Bitcoin is not tied to any government it has the ability to become a safe haven for people. 
As we saw when everything happened with Laiki &amp; Bank of Cyprus here. The Bubble was created by people speculating that everyone in Cyprus would rush out to buy Bitcoin, this was never going to happen because there was no easy way to access the Bitcoin markets with the banks closed and many people have not heard of Bitcoin, whilst those that have heard of it have a lack of understanding exactly what it can be used for. That is why we are giving people the easiest way to access and manage their Bitcoin using methods they already understand.

For bigger adoption Bitcoin needs to be accessible to the average user who doesn't know anything other than traditional banking methods. For example an 8 digit account number is easier and less daunting to deal with than a Bitcoin address. They generally do not care that the account number is linked directly to the public key of their wallet nor wish to pay it any attention. All they care about "is my money safe from those who wish to dip their hands into their bank accounts". That is the rel issue here.

Small constant changes from tradition are more widely accepted, have you tried explaining the inner workings of the Bitcoin network to someone aged 70? I did when the EU stated they were taking 10% of his life savings he was completely lost. But the point he did understand was the fact that no government could take his money against his will. If you faced a similar problem (Not knowing where you are globally based) you would be more receptive to the idea that you could keep more traditional methods whilst adding more security to your investments. One thing we shall offer is the ability to convert cash to a paper wallet generated, printed, loaded and sealed in front of the customer. The private key is theirs to keep and they can return the wallet to cash it for FIAT, Gold or Silver whenever they choose.

The demand for the Bitcoin protocol is becoming very real, especially considering the fact it allows me to transfer money internationally without the need to head over to my bank and pay a €20/€30 fee for a wire transfer that takes 5 days to reach it's destination. I could pay by credit card but that increases the cost for the merchant and makes the risk of charge back much higher and they don't obtain the spendable funds for a number of days.
Bitcoin is a protocol and not a new financial product, the protocol can be used for so much more other than the transfer of value.

Technically yes we will have that with the way the partnership will work with our private banking partner who will be connecting us to the existing banking infrastructure. But we are not offering deposits that are kept in Euros as they are converted to Bitcoin at the time of deposit. If your deposit equals 100BTC we will hold 100BTC for you.

We have zero exposure to the existing banking infrastructure here in Cyprus. We are currently in discussions with financial providers that will provide some connectivity to the existing Banking infrastructure but we are currently under an NDA with each one. Once I can say more about the strategic partnerships we will release the details. This should be possible by the time we release our full prospectus. We will always have our branch network where our customers and depositors will have access to their accounts where they can also deposit Euros directly into their account.
@_date: 2013-07-19 08:34:47
If we obtain 0.1% of deposits held by the local residents here in Cyprus we would add €38,000,000 to the Bitcoin market and the sustainable impact this would have on the exchange rate would pretty much require that mBTC becomes the standard unit used on our systems.
@_date: 2013-09-20 05:06:06
There is already a distaste towards the Euro because of what the EU forced upon people here.
Providing that advice would be something we wouldn't do without providing the risks involved. That is why we are offering pegged accounts that remove that risk from the depositor, to introduce them to Bitcoin slowly. Dropping big changes onto our customers in one big go would only serve to create more barriers.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:02:15
Nope, but never the less a good question if you wasn't previously aware of Neo.
Even if we are not in business the customers coins are still theirs. Even if the price drops by some theoretical rate, we are confident we can trade through it, use income derived from our other operations in scenarios like these.

I think it is a good idea, some people do not like the risk of extreme volatility and this takes a step to bridge that gap in the market.
I had previously posed the question with regards who holds the private keys of which Jav answered for me. I am working on a similar solution but on a larger scale and have my own solutions to this issue.
If you break or lose your phone, your wallet should be recoverable because the private keys are held by Bridgewalker to enable the functionality of this particular wallet.
Existing Bitcoiners know how to secure their own wallet and accept the volatility risk, however as greater adoption occurs less and less people will be in this position.
If he made the wallet open source for other service providers to operate this service, it would create the perfect opportunity for scammers to take advantage of people entering Bitcoin for the first time. However I am sure he could open source a wallet that operates using the API for your preferred exchange using your own accounts.

We would be utilizing a carrier to provide branded insurance products, there are so many contributing factors to consider before determining any realistic income and costing projections based on each different carrier option that we have available to us.
International remittance has always been "there" in the thought process but significant advancements have been made since the updates were made. 3 days makes a lot of difference because as more people learn about Neo &amp; Bee the more outside contact is being made with myself, with 19/20 hour working days, you can get a lot of progress made in one day, being so many hours ahead of the US, Canada and South America allows me time to complete local meetings during the day and handle international collaborations at night.
100% agreed that if influential figures provided a second opinion that there was a "new" way to interact with their money, then trust could be established and they would be inclined to use the services.

Because that is not how the bail ins worked. It wasn't just a demand from the Government saying "all that money is now ours" the bail ins only happened at the banks that needed the money to remain in business. Their customers are classed as unsecured creditors so they were contractually allowed to take those funds and not return them when they were essentially bankrupt. We operate on a full reserve basis so our customers are not unsecured creditors to us. Sorry if this doesn't make sense I am on my phone whilst travelling, so I will edit any errors when I get back to my computer.

We don't openly trade our customers Bitcoin, if the rate drops we add coins to their wallet from our own reserves and on increases, Bitcoin is added to our reserve. Our most important factor is to ensure we have enough Bitcoin in reserve to top up the customers wallets on a drop in the exchange rate. That is why we are opening up avenues with existing platforms that currently offer the traditional markets for them to add Bitcoin, these platforms can be used by almost anyone.

To implement BitPay it requires nothing more than copy and pasting a few lines of code.
You asked for a source I gave you one.
It's still very new and the full potential of the protocol hasn't been put to good use yet. It seems like something has got to be an overnight success for you otherwise it isn't worth bothering with. All figures point upwards and show steady growth unless you only look at the small daily/hourly picture. Real growth is realized over years and since the genesis block Bitcoin has grown considerably, failure to recognize that is just showing a complete lack of understanding of any growth pattern that has ever taken place across any platform.

The VISA/Mastercard network infrastructure is exactly the same for both credit and debit cards. A debit card is commonly a Visa Debit these days and the barriers to entry here in Cyprus are pretty high because JCC, the monopoly holder of the electronic payment processing industry here does not want anyone else to offer VISA/Mastercard payments.


We have plans to grow globally over a period of time, however I hope you understand that we wish to build solid foundations here in Cyprus before concentrating on the whole European marketplace. It is a huge undertaking in Cyprus alone and one of the biggest start-ups in the Bitcoin space. So we wish to walk before we try running.

Certain aspects of the business would require licensing to take place in both parts of the island. We can trade anything we like for Bitcoin, it isn't a matter of if we can accept Lira, its a matter of getting the green light from both regulatory bodies.

I wouldn't like to flat out refuse to consider the possibility of doing business in the north, however right now it is not something we shall be doing.

If people hadn't adopted email or the internet for that matter would it have died a death? Bitcoin acceptance is growing at quite some rate. If it reaches a point of 50% global acceptance and stays there indefinitely, it still works and will continue to work. What if VISA/Mastercard acceptance stagnates with no new people accepting it will both entities fail? Was the acceptance of VISA/Mastercard instant with millions of merchants accepting them the day after they launched? Bitcoin is still very young and it is a maturing market, these things take time as with almost anything so new.

Hi, we do not need one because Bitcoin has no classification as money in Cyprus. We are lobbying to have this changed and have Bitcoin specific legislation created so we do not have the need to operate within grey areas of the law. Even under the electronic money law, Bitcoin is not covered yet because it would require a centralised issuer. All central bank deposits have been considered and included within our projected costs should they decide to change the existing framework to encompass Bitcoin. Something we don't believe they will do because of the opportunity to create favourable trading conditions for Bitcoin related businesses thus attracting outside investment into the country.

We do not keep a 100% reserve of euro equivalents, we keep 100% of the Bitcoin required to service the pegged accounts and btc-denominated accounts, the latter being nothing more than a wallet service with income derived from the initial margins determined by our local index.

Part of my start-up is creating an alternative payment network for merchants based on the Visa/Mastercard model but we are using our own POS, cards, network infrastructure and linking the accounts to Bitcoin denominated bank accounts where our depositors can credit Euros directly into their account in one of our branches. We will be offering pre-paid cards for tourists. We already have close to 1000 merchants wanting to take up the services and install the card readers here in the capital of Cyprus. That is without any marketing and just speaking to business owners when completing our research.

This is something that I have been working on recently (well something very similar), the biggest hurdle is based on the fact that to make the Bitcoin balance fluctuate you are handing over the private key to the service provider.

I think the potential should be looked into and maybe innovate the sector a little because where cars park shouldn't make any difference as to how a businesses operational ability and security, unless the parked cars are a health and safety risk that could potentially cost the business a large settlement through injury etc.
I fully understand that the current system has its failings with regards to audits and corruptibility however I have always been a fan of surprise audits, don't give the company time to patch over their mistakes and failings that is the only realistic way to prevent this kind of behavior.
The existing Bitcoin community is somewhat programmed to question everything which is brilliant, however the average person in the street may make more of their decisions based on companies that have a reputable seal of approval.

Is it better for me to hold or spend my Euros? If I save them instead of buying a Mini today and I hold them for a few years and constantly add to them with all the other Euros I get my hands on I can buy a Ferrari.
People will always have wants and needs, they will always spend money. Bitcoin transaction volume is increasing and more business are reporting increased revenues once accepting Bitcoin, Foodler's Bitcoin derived income is growing at 30% a month I believe. So the argument that everyone is hoarding is a non starter.
@_date: 2013-09-20 20:18:06
We operate on a full reserve principles, so we exchange the EUR for BTC and when the price falls we trade our own reserves and add BTC to the pegged wallets. The BTC wallets are just like purchasing Bitcoin through an exchange and holding the coins in a hosted wallet.

We have spent several months making direct connections with influential individuals, decision makers and political contacts. There is no legal framework for Bitcoin here in Cyprus, Bitcoin is not recognized as money however we are working extremely hard to change this.

@_date: 2013-06-28 21:27:40
Not entirely true, as a long term holder of Bitcoin I prefer to hold my coins and buy more things with them, something that is happening more and more as the adoption by merchants increases. Speculating is not just holding coins. My sole intentions with Bitcoin is using it as an alternative monetary solution not just to make my wealth increase. If it was 1BTC/1USD I would be happy if I can still keep my money out of the hands of governments and buy goods and services. I am not a speculator in the slightest.

During this period we will be adding volume to the markets, increasing demand, however should the rate continually fall it will be dependent upon our trading and financial team to ensure we stay sufficiently liquid during this period. We will have access to existing trading platforms (So will others in Europe) to trade options and futures. I have made a solid effort to speak directly with the partners in the companies that operate these platforms (Many of these platforms operate from within Cyprus, which is beneficial) in a bid to ensure they integrate Bitcoin. Every meeting has been extremely positive, with many partners making plans on how they will allow Bitcoin to be traded on their platforms and plans for the technological integration with their existing platforms before the meeting has concluded.

The reader will be of zero cost to the customer, the €1.50 cost is over priced for precautionary reasons. Google the Barclays pinsentry and that will give you a clear indication as to what we will be providing our customers.
You will have to wait for us to allow accounts from within the EU, we are restricting the process to Cypriots because we don't want to create a back log from the initial rush to open accounts with ourselves, thus causing customer service problems (Something we are working hard to ensure doesn't happen).
Merchants will not be subjected to fees between 3% - 20% and settlement terms of 3 days up to 60 days when using the Bee network as they are here in Cyprus with the existing traditional providers.

It is what happens when you put information in front of someone that considers themselves to be highly intelligent and they do not understand it, so instantly it is bad because they cannot understand it, also misinformation is the biggest source of Bitcoin hate.
All debates I have are generally squashed when I tell them that I do not care if Bitcoin is $1 or $1000 because of 2 major reasons. I can still send money anywhere in the world instantly, bypassing political restrictions if the need arises. Also my government can try all they like but they cannot give my Bitcoin balance a 47.5% haircut.
I favor Bitcoin as a medium of exchange over anything else, when I suggest they read the source code and see everything else Bitcoin can be developed for in the future, some actually do and opinions change quickly.
Always remind them that Bitcoin is a technological innovation and not just some new financial product.
@_date: 2013-06-27 16:54:29

We will be launching an IPO through Bitfunder once the legalities have been ironed out, so making the general Bitcoin population aware of our presence is something that needs to be done. We are also interested in feedback from the existing community as it provides some refreshing light. When the "First Bitcoin ATM to be placed in Cyprus" was announced, the first thing I said was that it would never work, the majority of people here have no idea about Bitcoin and it was nothing more than an attempt to grab some publicity off the back of the banking failures here. We are at a point of negotiating with the Bank of Cyprus to purchase some of the now vacated premises that were previously Laiki Bank branches, so this is not just a concept.
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:35:32
Yes that is our business. I shall now PM you with further details.

My Name is Danny, not Daniel I am older than the person that sadly passed away. I will be in Amsterdam too, someone mentioned this on bitcointalk, I am more than willing to bring a heart rate monitor to show I am still very much alive.
My background is in both banking and business management. Upon completing full time education I had my first professional role with Abbey National PLC (now part of Santander) I was a qualified personal financial consultant whilst in this role, I then joined HSBC in a similar role but for high net worth individuals.  Upon leaving HSBC I assumed a directors role within the private security industry, during this time legislative changes were being enforced, this meant that I had to prepare and implement all compliance procedures throughout the entire business to ensure the business was fully compliant with the new legislation, during this time we grew turnover by 4x and increased our margins by 15%, even whilst the legislative changes were being enforced. I was responsible for just short of 250 employees including those contracted directly and sub-contracted. Following this role I have held senior management positions within a work based education company of which I helped restructure which led to the successful sale of the business. I have also made personal investments into the leisure industry. I have been an active Bitcoin user since late 2011, spent time trading Bitcoin always a lurker more than a contributor until now, started planning Neo &amp; Bee around 12 months ago and I have been working full time on the project since mid April when the Banking fiasco happened here in Cyprus.

This is old news and the problem with the rushed idea to place a Bitcoin ATM in Cyprus is the fact that hardly anyone know's what Bitcoin is here. Which is something I am working on changing.

The rate at which the Bitcoins are deposited and withdrawn locally is not identical to the open markets, we have our own index based on a multitude of factors that will determine the local price. The drop in price will be realized locally over a longer period of time.
Price movements either way are also a chance to profit, whilst the local changes take effect.
When they withdraw, other deposits will be made which will eat some of that requirement up. We will develop to a point that Bitcoins are not required to be dumped into the market to liquidate our positions on large withdrawals.

Thank you, you will be able to open an account for certain if you live here in Cyprus or within the EU. The deeper legalities about providing online sign ups in other jurisdictions needs further clarification which we will provide before launching the ability to sign up online for an account.

Thank you!
@_date: 2013-07-19 05:35:58
Thank you. We want to bring others to the market, we are creating the platform that will enable others to bring other "banks" to the marketplace around the world and even here in Cyprus we would welcome them. In fact part of our business model to recover some of the software development costs is to license the software to other start-ups in the same space to create a new banking and payment infrastructure.
Trust is the biggest thing for us here and we know we have to earn the trust of the Cypriot people and that is not an easy task all things considered but we have the biggest marketing agency here in Cyprus working with us to help portray the correct messages to the people.

Hi there, to invest into the IPVO you can use BitFunder, BTCT or Havelock depending on your preferences. Havelock and BTCT are both pass throughs operated by TAT Investments. If you reside in Cyprus you will be in able to register for one of the Neo services online or through one of our branches in Nicosia. We will be allowing other EU residents the opportunity to use our services once we have ensured that we don't create a back log of administrative processes for our new local customers. The customer service needs to be perfect to enable us to build a high level of trust with our customers.

We also have physical exchanges, as in retail branches. Hosted wallet service with an extremely simple user interface, insured hosted wallets too. We also have easyco.in coming online before Dec 31st, which allows the direct purchase of Bitcoin with cash in the US, UK, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Sweden. A licensed crypto portfolio management service for high net worth individuals, brokers, funds etc
@_date: 2013-07-04 08:57:35
My point was to indicate that with all the drops from the over inflated price of $100 are nothing to worry about if your in this for the long haul and not looking to just make a quick buck regardless of the platform. If Bitcoin closes on December 31st at $38.654 the Bitcoin economy has continued its growth at the same high rate as it did in 2012. Increases of 400% - 1000% are generally driven by an over inflated price through speculation, where as a more solid steady line of growth is driven through people wanting to use Bitcoin as a means of purchasing goods and services. So we should promote more innovation and greater adoption rates within the space other than promoting pure speculation.
@_date: 2013-07-30 04:49:48
The assets were frozen and the capital control limits were €300 per day from unfrozen assets and the maximum you could leave the country with in cash was €3000 whilst electronic transfers were limited to €5000 per month however these could only be completed with an invoice to accompany the transfer(s) or evidence that it was being sent to a student overseas.
A little birdy told me that despite the restrictions The Bank of Cyprus was losing €10m a day in withdrawals.

That is exactly my point. For mass adoption those are the questions that the marketing should answer before the business has even opened its doors to the public.
@_date: 2013-06-12 07:14:31
Here in Cyprus when the crisis hit, there was no way of getting Bitcoins for Cypriots that maybe wanted them and it is still ridiculously hard considering capital controls are still being enforced to ensure money does not leave the island either in cash or electronically. So whilst people will jump on the bandwagon when things collapse such as "Bitcoin ATM's in Cyprus" which is great for the existing users whom are unfortunately very rare. Argentinians face the problem that no one wants their fiat currency, so why would a BTC trader/seller? There only option is to trade goods, services and or precious metals/stones for them. A successful business needs planning and can't be thrown together overnight when things have already gone bad.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:17:56
There will be multiple of each across the island from February onwards, not just in Nicosia. You will also be able to purchase pre-paid Bee cards to load Bitcoin onto, so you don't incur large data roaming charges.

They have previous banking software development experience, developing our own team, is all well and good but when outsourcing the management of the project will be channeled through our CTO who also has other responsibilities and to acquire the services of a multitude of developers wouldn't allow us to place agreed time constraints and associated penalties for any failures to meet these on the development of the software. There are also so many other aspects of the business that require dedicated internal resources, so to place this module of the start up into external capable hands was the best decision for us.

The IPO figures will be determined on the prices we negotiate for the acquisition of the former Laiki branches and their renovations (most infrastructure is already in place with the branches) and the final decision from the Central Bank as to whether we are going to be a regulated business from the outset or not, although we expect them to follow the guidelines set by the ECB which reduces our start-up capital requirements.

@_date: 2013-06-10 11:30:42
Yes however they are all valid, however my bank here in Cyprus didn't tell me that my bank account would be subject to 10% being taken out against my will when I opened the accounts and neither did any news program ever mention this was a possibility. To add to that when I was younger someone from a bank came to my school and introduced us to banking and we all got our first account aged 13, they never told us the banks could just take the money from the account when they made huge mistakes to cover the cost.  
@_date: 2013-09-11 06:37:15
They can only confiscate deposits if the customer is an unsecured creditor to the failing bank. It was the government that authorized the confiscation but essentially it was the banks that took the money to prop themselves up. 
With the use of multi-sig addresses, the funds cannot be confiscated without the input of the depositor in a Bitcoin based bank.
It is the right place, because there is no other country that has such a level of distrust in the traditional banking sector right now. So they want an alternative to what is already available.
@_date: 2013-09-20 06:48:57
1. Yes online payments will be possible, with the smart card readers for Neo customers. We want to establish contact with the existing providers to enable integration for our card holders with existing Bitcoin merchants. This is top of my agenda at the Amsterdam conference.
2. If you have a BTC Denominated wallet or pegged product, we do not trade with the coins held in your wallet, so it wouldn't benefit us in any other way, the only benefit would be an increase in our reserves when the price rises if you held them in a pegged wallet. The BTC Denominated wallet would be no different to using an exchange (we will make the exchange fee) and keeping the BTC in any trustworthy hosted wallet.
3. We expect 1000 terminals to be available in Nicosia upon the opening of our first two branches. We are in talks with some large brands that will promote the adoption of Bee just through their name being linked to Bee. Merchants are also a target group for the adoption of Neo because of the instant settlement and vastly lower transaction fees. We are going to be ensuring they prefer Bee payments over Visa and Mastercard settlements.

I have read it several times since 2011, still don't understand your point? Maybe you want everyone to hold their own wallet with no idea how to protect it or obtain the Bitcoins.

I do offer Bitcoin personally for sale to people, however the culture here is not one that spends the majority of time online due to the climate etc. So having any understanding of Bitcoin is highly unlikely hence our approach will be toning it down from a technological point of view and promoting the benefits through strategic marketing campaigns.

We have pushed our conferences back to the start of January for the merchants, this decision was taken to ensure we drive attendance for our own conferences whilst at the Investors show, many of those attending the investors show have fingers in many retail operations. The Bee terminals will also be demonstrated at the Investors show in December. We also have a well known speaker from within the community coming to speak at our own conferences too. 
The company making their own announcements are putting something really special together. The BIG brand I have a meeting with early this week, so should be taking more steps towards making that information public then.
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:23:26
We are not offering a central authority, we are giving our customers a way to obtain Bitcoin, store them and spend them. Maybe you do not understand exactly what we are doing here in Cyprus, the reason for our services or our target demographic. If you do not trust Bitcoins to anyone else are you going to indefinitely hoard them without spending a single one that you obtain through mining alone?
@_date: 2013-08-10 09:28:52
That is called saving them (saving money is a good thing...or only when it suits?) The transaction volume is growing, yes much of it is speculative but that can be said for almost everything that is traded. The more people that want something the more it will cost you oil, gold, silver, cattle, sheep, horses, pandas, camels, dollars, euros.... the list is endless. But it doesn't matter to me if its worth $1 or $1000 on the markets because it is the protocol that i am interested in.
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:58:47
Bitcoin will always be overpriced when world events increase news coverage, speculators jump on the bandwagon and that sends prices soaring. When the attention fades the prices find their true level because those who jumped in expecting returns of 100% within days panic and sell off as the prices fall.
Bitcoin's true value is being used as a trade token for goods and services, the more demand for Bitcoin services and products the higher the natural value.
This is my personal opinion.
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:16:18
And these are the exact same questions I have my marketing team answering when I launch my business here for the masses. It is going to keep it really simple and the way the customers manage their funds will be very similar to what they already do with their existing banks, but if they want the finer details on how it works we shall provide them for the customers/potential customers.
The main hate I find is that people misconceive it as a new financial product and not a technological innovation.

This is something I have addressed with the "Bee Payment Network" The terminals accept our Neo customers cards and can produce a QR code for existing Bitcoin users.

We will remove the technicalities of Bitcoin and it's use. You need to understand the Cypriot people and their lifestyles to understand why this is paramount to the use of Bitcoin here in Cyprus. You also need to understand that anything that has the potential of stopping life savings being raided by the traditional banks is something that 99.9% of Cypriots want.
Lending is not something we are offering at the initial launch, however any lending would need to be pegged to the Euro because you are right it would be a bad business model when lending purely with a deflationary currency.
