In version 0.1, the Satoshi client was a wallet, a full node and a miner. Nowadays miners run their own code and most people use different wallet code. So the full node is the only thing the devs have left to control. Now some suggest we remove the block size limit and let the miners control the block sizes. Additionally, even fewer people will run the full node code. The devs have lost a lot of influence in the bitcoin community and stand to lose more.
Additionally a lot of the arguments I see from them are to the tune of 


The devs do not want to fulfil the social contract with the users, nor do they particularly care what the users and stake-holders want. IMHO this upcoming fork will be about more than just the blocksize, but about whether Bitcoin should develop like a technocracy or a free-market direct democracy.

It is and I agree with you. However an 'expert' is not always right, especially about something like the future direction our project should take. We would make a big mistake as a community if we let a few experts control and guide our project completely. If you read the link I gave in the previous message, it goes into more detail why this plan, of letting experts decide everything, is often a very bad idea.

Considering voting rights are granted by government how could they possibly be enacted by a wise and all-knowing society? The right to vote for the very government that you want to continue to intervene. Presumably there was a large social movement that eventually ended in the government enacting the new laws.

Most metals are boring grey, but gold being yellow and very dense makes it both easily recognizable and yet relatively hard to counterfeit. That's a rare combination.

Those centralized governments in Nordic countries like Norway, Sweden, Denmark, (that you mentioned) are all relatively tiny countries. Most of them are smaller than many individual US states. The Nordic region is in fact a collection of fiercely independent states (unlike the EU which has unified into an empire). 
There is nothing wrong with a centralized government as long as it's not a one-world government. Just like an individual company can have whatever system of power it wants, as long as it doesn't dominate an entire sector and there is a dynamic balance and competition.

I think most people on this sub subscribe to the Austrian-economics definition of inflation - that it is simply an increase in the supply of money. No need to confuse things by saying money isn't stable due to changing prices.
I think a big reason for this process of finding a unit of weight not based on a physical object is that it takes away the *control* anybody has over the unit. If the guys in the video succeed, the measure of a kg will be independently verifiable anywhere in the world and no commission will be an authority over it. That is what they strive for if science is to discover objective truths about our world.
Similarly what we want from our unit of value is a unit that no single party controls. The prices of apples and oranges will float on the market, but the unit in which everything is priced should not be left to the whim of some authority in New York or Brussels.

I think most people on this sub subscribe to the Austrian-economics definition of inflation - that it is simply an increase in the supply of money. So I guess me and you just have a different definition of what it means to have an 'unchanging unit of value'.
@_date: 2015-05-18 15:04:41
This is where economics being a social science is just different to the hard sciences.
Consider however the way we usually calculate inflation. A dollar now buys a lot more electronics than it did a decade ago. At the same time it buys a lot less food and energy than it did a decade ago. Add to this confusion the fact that the total supply of dollars has changed dramatically during the last decade. If we at least fix the supply of our unit of value, it won't fix the buying power of that unit as you correctly argue, but it will at least simplify one side of the equation.
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:19:14
The value of *things* change, but the supply of the unit of value can remain the same. One of the reasons gold was always a useful unit of value because its supply was very unlikely to undergo a rapid expansion.
Regarding your first point, I think the scientists did have a problem with it, as the guy in the video points out, look at the resources that need to be spent just to keep that bar of platinum safe. If somebody broke in and altered it, we would literally have to redefine our measuring system. Also, the bar being in France, gives those who have access to it certain privilege. This is against the spirit of science.
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:23:22
Exactly. Control trumps ownership. 
If you own land, you need a sheriff or the state to honor your land title and help you to exclude others from your land if you so demand it. If you control land (presumably by having an army) you can exclude others yourself and do not need the state or the courts.

Well sure I agree, mass is an absolute real world quantity whereas value is subjective and personal. However, market value is indeed quantifiable (by experiment) and an ideal unit of market value should have similar properties to an ideal unit of any other measurement, IMHO. To let a central authority control the supply of our units of value makes economics a lot less scientific.

Other financial businesses and services already have your identity and collect vast amounts of information about you and your behaviour. They need it for fraud prevention as their systems are all based on your identity and not on pseudonymous cryptographic keys. So for them doing AML/KYC is much easier and part of their everyday practice regardless of whether government authorities require it or not. 
Bitcoin on the other hand functions perfectly without you giving up any of your personal information. It is an inherently different system to traditional banking. Also most traditional financial companies are very big. To them, complying with burdensome regulations is annoying but not a huge proportion of their profits. A small bitcoin start-up running from someone's garage will easily run through all of their money in legal fees and compliance. This is one of the reasons there are so few financial start-ups. It's almost impossible to start a new bank.

What a load of nonsense. Many of the greatest scientific contributions have been made by people without any degree. Many old mathematics problems were solved by amateurs in their basements. Economics is a much 'softer' science than these, if it can even be called so, so demanding a degree in order to be able to contribute to a discussion is ridiculous. 
There's a reason why in all fields of science you have to publish your data, your experiments and all your workings. So that the wider community can convince themselves that your work is valid. It is not enough just to convince a bunch of 'experts' behind a closed-doors meeting. 
Historically look at how many things experts got wrong. They were removing appendices and tonsils for no good reason. They were putting asbestos in our walls for decades. They were recommending smoking in order to 'soothe' the throat. You can go down the line.
That is not to say that experts are all stupid and we should decide everything democratically - precisely the opposite. We must involve the general public and let them make their own decisions and share their unique perspectives. Because none of us know everything.
@_date: 2015-07-31 08:43:45
There are actually many more countries with fast and cheap internet than those three I mentioned. For example Lithuania, Bulgaria, Estonia, the Ukraine, Scandinavian countries. Even Russia has on average much faster upload speed than the west. If you have literally dozens of countries, each with dozens of cities that can easily run full nodes on a home connection even now, is that not decentralized enough? It seems very self-restricting to wait for a rich country like the UK or USA to finally allow their speeds to climb to sufficient levels. We know if they really wanted to, they could do it today, but the low upload speeds are politically motivated.

He also had a Bitcoin guest on his show whom he asked about litecoins and the guest replied that he does not believe in them.

Methinks Rick Falkvinge sold all of his bitcoins and is now engaging in some market manipulation of his own, in order to buy it back on the cheap.

It is even worse than that. If there's no cash, how do you 'cash-out' if you don't trust your bank anymore? Buy gold with a bank transfer?
A lot of banks are teetering on the edge these days.

I bought from here before. Their support is top notch. They helped me out quite a bit with my corrupt Australian customs troubles. Even re-sent a package for free that customs stole.

Max Keiser never pumped Quarks. Afaik he doesn't own any Quarks.

People like to avoid politics here and that's fine, but if you read Satoshi's original manifesto, he was quite clear about wanting to wrestle the power to print money from the central banks. We cannot have free markets without free (as in freedom) money. I think all the other stuff like high fees, inflation, political paywalls, financial surveillance etc are just a sonequence of our country's failure to adopt a free money.

I think the level of debate and criticism here is very good compared to the investment community, for example. Look at how Peter Schiff is/was treated when he called the US economy weak or dared to claim that the housing market is in a bubble. 
Of course we try to be more scientific here but it's hard when it's your money on the line.

Deflation is also poison for all institutions operating at high leverage. That's the banks, central banks, insurance companies etc.

Not true. He always mentions he recommended silver at $7.

In Australia we already have a planned 0.05% levy on all bank deposits. Why so little?  It looks like a test of the water.

Why not just pass a law that makes all bitcoins illegal, then?

He is looking at bitcoin as wealth. Same as gold. Money and wealth are not necessarily different things. Keynesians like to push the idea that money is purely for transactions and not for savings or capital formation. But we don't have to agree with them.

Everybody is worried about that, but at some point we have to grow a pair. Thinking like yours is the reason places like Russia have never had any liberty (speaking from experience).

I don't like how the term 'speculation' has such a negative connotation. If you are holding dollars are you speculating? What about gold? The fact is no matter where you park your money you are taking risks. 
Borrowing to buy bitcoins is another story. I would call that speculation.

Unfortunately Bitcoin is not a cureall that will solve corruption and instill morality and integrity in mankind. Bitcoin gives us freedom and power. What we do with it is up to us.
Integrity is lacking not only in this community, though.
