A system built of voluntary interaction cannot lead to private property and absentee ownership, it's impossible. Either the system isn't voluntary (thus I'm forced to participate insofar as your private property is concerned) or you can't have ownership of property (thus if I choose not to participate in your system, I'm not forced to recognize your claim on property).
Anarcho-capitalism isn't really about voluntary participation, it can't be, if it were then people could voluntarily choose not to participate and your claim to private ownership would be null. Anarcho-capitalism is about forcing everyone to "voluntarily" agree to your set of rules. It's totalitarianism with a pretty name.

I can honestly say I've never invested in anything I didn't believe would succeed. I don't see why cynics would invest in Bitcoin nor why not investing in Bitcoin would bring a person into question.
I'm optimistic about Tesla and I don't have any money invested (minus anything my mutual funds happen to hold) in it because I keep my holdings diversified. I'm pessimistic about the long term prospects of IBM, but I'm not shorting the stock, again because I like diversity and also because shorting is a riskier investment style that doesn't suit my long term investment goals.

As I keep saying, I don't see the Blockchain as valuable.


That's not true. For transactions, decentralization is *always* less efficient than a centralized solution (hence the constant refrain about how Satoshi "solved" the Byzantine General's Problem). The only reason to choose Bitcoin over centralized solutions is the politics behind it. Honestly though, you don't have to take it from me, [here's Peter Todd saying the same thing](


Just think about it for a second, is it more efficient to update one centralized processor about the validity of a transaction, or to get hundreds of decentralized processors to all agree about the validity of a transaction?

And that changes the effects of a deflationary spiral, why? It doesn't matter why the money is appreciating, if you can be reasonably assured that your money is going to buy more tomorrow than it will today, the economically sound thing to do is to wait until tomorrow to buy stuff. If I can buy a Hyundai with my bitcoin this year, or wait until next year and buy a Lamborghini, I'll wait until next year. If that effect continues indefinitely then I will continue to put off my purchases and "make" money by holding on to my cash. The longer I hold onto my cash, the less demand there is in the market. The less demand the more prices drop. The more prices drop the more value my cash accrues and the more I'll hold onto it. A deflationary spiral. This is really really bad and it turns mild economic problems into catastrophic ones.

Nope, despite what the Austrians want to claim, the great depression occurred because of a deflationary spiral:
"Once people expect the price declines, they delay purchases as long as possible. They know the longer they wait, the lower the price will be. This further decreases demand, causing businesses to slash prices even more. It is a vicious, downward spiral.
Massive deflation helped turn a recession into the Great Depression. As unemployment rose, demand for goods and services fell. Prices dropped 10% a year. As prices fell, companies went out of business. More people became unemployed. When the dust settled, world trade essentially collapsed. The amount of goods and services traded fell 25%, but -- thanks to deflation -- the value of this trade was down 65% (as measured in dollars)."

Exactly, Buffet values in investing in things that produce, not in things that stay static. If you buy a bitcoin today and you sit on it for one year, in one year you have.. a bitcoin. You are speculating that if you buy a bitcoin today that in one year you can find someone else who values the bitcoin more and buy it for more.
Stock investing, as Buffet does, is about investing in a company and owning part of a company that produces and sells goods. You are buying a share of the profit from that production, it grows in value. At the end of a year you still own the same portion of the company, but you also own a portion of the profit from everything they've produced over the year. If you invest in the right companies you can make a lot of money through that growth (though you run the risk of investing in a Neo and Bee type company that takes the money and runs, but then you take a risk that people will value Bitcoin much less in a year than they do right now, so either one is a risk).
I'll get downvoted, of course, but sadly just doesn't get what Buffet is saying, and by trying to attack him the people around here show how naive they are.

Another way to think about it:  If you go to a casino and win $1000 in chips, you still owe taxes on the income (the $1000 you made) even if you don't convert the chips to cash. That's an open flow system, the chips have a real cash value and thus you've earned real cash. Bitcoin is like that, there is a real value at the time you mine the coin, so the money you made at that time is income.

Because you aren't really experiencing deflation. For all intents and purposes Bitcoin is pegged to the dollar right now. The fluctuations in price you are seeing aren't inflation or deflation, they are changes in the valuation of the coin relative to the dollar. When it's high you have no guarantee that next week it will be higher and when it's low you have no guarantee next week it will be lower.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:35:55


Income tax. 
The difference is that dollars don't change in value relative to dollars, so you don't have to worry about capital gains or losses on the dollar as it's always worth a dollar. If you acquire a bitcoin that is worth $600 you've gained $600 worth of income, the same thing that would occur if I gave you $600 in cash. Either way you have to report it.
If you spend your $600 you haven't gained any income, you've traded it for $600 in goods. Nothing to report.
If you trade your bitcoin for $700 worth of goods, you've now gained $100 of income, and it's taxed just like the other income (sorta, it would be considered capital gains so you get a tax break over regular income that you gain from doing actual work).
There is nothing magic happening here, if you get income you have to pay taxes on it. That's how it works.

Your argument is that one of bitcoin's primary selling points is that it will facilitate you breaking the law and evade taxes easier than you could have before. And the people around here wonder why bitcoin is associated with lawbreaking.
Your argument is pretty silly though, a transaction in gold or cash is much harder to trace than a bitcoin transaction where every transaction is in the public ledger. I could operate for cash under the table or trade only in gold and the big bad government would have no way of tracing my transactions. But if I did that I'd be breaking the law, and since I don't want to be a criminal who is disconnected from society I don't engage in such behaviors.


Taxes are a debt that you incur when you engage in a transaction. The utility of the dollar is that no matter the currency of the transaction you are required to pay that debt to the government in dollars, so you need to get ahold of some of those bad boys to pay off the tax debt you have built up. You and I can enter into a contract that does not in any way involve dollars, you can owe a debt to me in gold and that is perfectly legal; however, any income gain from that transaction will be taxed in dollars.
Legal tender laws serve two functions, first they require the government to accept legal tender as payment for all taxes, second they *default* debt payments to legal tender; however, they do not require that we use cash for our transactions, we could enter a contract for gold or oil or bitcoins or whatever if we wanted (hence why futures trading is possible). What they do is prevent you from providing me a service for, lets say $10, and then when I come to pay with $10 allow you to say you only take gold (or vice versa allow me to demand to pay only in bitcoins). You can however offer a service in exchange for an ounce of gold (or a satoshi of bitcoins, or whatever) and after the service is complete accept the gold or bitcoins for payment, just so long as we negotiate the contract in those terms.

Which is to say he is doing exactly what a deflationary spiral predicts. His thought is that the price is low now, thus in the future it will be higher, so he should hold and spend it in the future when it's worth more. That's the entire theory behind deflationary spirals.

See, this is where the Bitcoin community thinks they've gone and found some magical new thing that never existed before. What I mean by "cash under the table" is the long honored tradition that has existed since the invention of the income tax that is paying someone and not reporting it. For example, a relative of mine will go around after every major storm and offer to clean up your yard for $50.

If you believe this then if you keep buying Bitcoin you are feeding money directly into China and they'll never stop. The only solution would be to stop falling for it, and the only way to do that is to stop buying Bitcoin because if they are able to manipulate the market as you suggest, then buying Bitcoin is akin to a direct transfer of your wealth to China's treasury.

Well, first one would expect that you'd have thought something must be wrong well before this length of time and already contacted your bank to start the process. Second, many banks give 1-2 years and in pre-order situations like this one you almost certainly would have a few months after the pre-order failed to ship to issue a chargeback. That's the thing about working with a bank, you are their customer and they work with you to rectify the situation because they want to keep you as a customer.
But scams like the general state of the mining industry couldn't exist if they were depending on CC payment providers instead of effectively asking you to go into a dark alley and pay them cash in advance.

You realize that what you are quoting is not the Tax Code, right?
The Tax Code is the law that governs the IRS. It is written by congress. What the IRS released today will not be found *anywhere* in the tax code and it will not in any way dictate to the courts what the law is. What the IRS released today is their view of how the tax code applies to Bitcoin. If you disagree with the IRS (and you may, that's fine, it's a free country, you are allowed to do that) you can take them to court and ask for clarification of the law. If Congress disagrees with the IRS's interpretation of the tax code, it can pass new law that further clarifies the issue. The IRS cannot write tax code, it is not within their purview.
You are the one with the warped sense of how things work. It would benefit you (if you are a US citizen) to take a Civics 101 class. Its not nearly as mystifying as you make it out to be.

No, I'm not analogizing anything. I'm giving you examples of tax evasion. You are the one proposing that the average cryptocurrency user will become a tax evader (and thus putting themselves in the same group of criminals as drug lords). I don't think that will happen. Much like how the majority of users of dollars aren't rolling in dollars, but they also pay their taxes, despite the fact that people like you claiming that the IRS can't find them if they don't report their taxes.


I would hate those ideas, which is why I hope your dystopian fantasy world full of tax evaders doesn't come to fruition. I certainly don't want to get audited or my transactions tracked because someone like you doesn't pay their taxes.


With magic pixie dust!
Actually the same way we've discussed until now, by requiring that you report your gains and punish you if they catch you not doing it. If they find widespread abuse they will find ways to track that; for example, by tracking the exchanges where people go to exchange litecoin for bitcoin, etc. But again, you are the one suggesting that the average cryptocurrency user is going to be a criminal that won't pay taxes; I personally have more faith in the community than that.

It certainly wasn't like the denizens of like to portray it, some underground thing that only the chosen few really understood.

I would bet that the hashrate increase has a lot more to do with the sunk costs fallacy than anything else. Miners got in the game with a huge capital investment and now they are leaking money chasing after a profit they are never going to get. In the business world they call it "throwing good money after bad", you're already "invested" in the idea that you are going to get rich being a profitable miner, you've already commit to the capital you've thrown into it, might as well run for "just one more" month at a loss to see if you can turn it all around. An [escalation of commitment](
Keep in mind that a vast majority of businesses fail, and a lot of these guys who are mining are inexperienced in the business world *and* got into the mining game because they were chasing "easy money". To think that more than 10% of them *at most* will ever make a profit is giving far too much credit to the mining world.

You are missing that most of doesn't really get how the government works (other than "it's bad"(TM)). Manchin requests oversight from the regulatory bodies that Congress (including Manchin) authorized to give oversight. The regulatory bodies then respond that they don't feel that the authorities that congress has given them already covers this topic. The next step for Manchin will be to craft a bill expanding the fed's ability to provide oversight and/or creating a new regulatory body/expanding some other regulatory body and/or finding one that does have authority, etc.
This isn't that Manchin is an "idiot" (though he may be), it's just one step along the way to legislating. Just because the fed said "nope" doesn't mean that you are in the clear.
The idea is that Congress creates legislation that empowers the "experts" in the various bodies to perform the will of Congress to the best of their expert abilities. Manchin sent out a letter that said, in essence, "I don't like this, which of the groups of experts is going to fix it?" and the Fed responded "not us, unless you give us more power".  The Fed also pointed its finger to other bodies that it felt *did* have the power.

* Members are encouraged or required to live and/or socialize only with other group members.
* Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
* The leadership dictates, sometimes in great detail, how members should think, act, and feel (for example, members must get permission to date, change jobs, marry—or leaders prescribe what types of clothes to wear, where to live, whether or not to have children, how to discipline children, and so forth).
* The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members (for example, the leader is considered the Messiah, a special being, an avatar—or the group and/or the leader is on a special mission to save humanity).
* The group is preoccupied with making money.
* The most loyal members (the “true believers”) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group. They believe there is no other way to be, and often fear reprisals to themselves or others if they leave (or even consider leaving) the group.

Is it worth the IRS making sure I declare the $0.08 dividend my low balance checking account paid out last year? I have no doubt that people can and will skip tiny amounts of taxes, just like they always have and they always will. There is a difference between skipping the capital gains on a $10 transaction from a bitcoin you bought for $8 and trying to use Bitcoins for massive tax fraud. The government is probably much more worried about one over the other, but giving rules on how to treat the asset in the tax code is the first step in stoping the one they are interested in.

One doesn't have to believe in a "single minded entity" to believe that any corporation or group of corporations is "hellbent on massive wealth accumulation". That's the point of a corporation: accumulating wealth. 
I don't think, nor do I think that Eisenhower thought, that there is some ubar Illuminati conspiracy of corporations working together in seekrit to promote war for the sake of profit, but all corporations (and people) work towards their own self interests. So when many self interests align, many people work together towards that cause, not necessarily (or even normally) in unison or even realizing they are working together.

How, in a world where land has been previously monopolized by generations of "first users" before me am I voluntarily living within a system that dictates that because your ancestors used the land before my ancestors, that land is unusable by me?

Its a horribly bad selling point because no one in their right mind is going to believe that the savings will be passed on to the consumer. The argument has long been made that we should lower corporate taxes because those costs are just passed on to the consumer anyways, but if you look at public opinion 70+% of people want to *increase* corporate taxes. People realize that the costs involved for the merchant are not directly translated to the consumer and if the "advantage" of bitcoin is saving the merchant some fees, its not a compelling argument to say that lowering those fees will lower consumer prices.

I don't think that matters much. You can't hide assets of value from the bankruptcy courts in an attempt to hold on to them. The whole point of bankruptcy is to have a structured way for the courts to determine who gets what. Unfortunately I would guess that the lowest tier on the list of creditors would be the customers, anyone Mt. Gox owes money to will probably get a cut before it trickles to the customers (as those loans would be higher rated, the customers 'knew' they were taking a risk when they used the service). I could be wrong (and I'd love to hear from an expert in bankruptcy law, especially Japanese), but I think the court will just see those Bitcoins as another liquidatable asset.
For instance, if Karpeles tried to claim that his company owned Lamborghini wasn't listed as a company asset in the bankruptcy court so they can't liquidate it to pay the creditors, the court would just laugh and sell the car (and possibly put Karpeles in jail, depending on the circumstances of him trying to hide assets).
The jail part is probably why you are seeing an announcement now. Likely, he didn't report the coins initially and his lawyer said "hey, you are going to go to jail if you try to hide those" so now he's told the court about additional assets they found while looking through the books.

It doesn't matter the currency used for the exchange, if a tax applies to the transaction it is your duty to pay it. Thus no matter if you are paying in dollars or bitcoins for your new mattress from Overstock.com, if sales tax applies (see your local and state laws to find out if it does) then you are required to pay sales tax. Not doing so is called "tax evasion" and it's not looked upon kindly by the government. :)

Depends on the system, if there is no real world value to the money you are earning then you do not have to report it as income. This is called a "closed-flow system". Wow falls into that category, because there is no legitimate market for moving money back and forth (though as I said above, income made from an illegitimate market has to be reported). If there is an open flow system, where the items you are earning have a real cash value (think a system where each gold can be traded in to the operator for $1) then anything you earn in that system has to be reported as income even if you don't sell it.
This isn't rocket surgery, if you are making real world money you are paying real world taxes.

I keep telling you people this, but no its not. Never has been and never will be. Those coins are Gox property and they were the moment you handed them to Gox.
Those coins will be liquidated and if there is anything at all left over after secured debt and lawyer's feeds you may get a portion of the leftovers in cash based on the proportion of coins you had given to Gox (but that leftover will be split among all other unsecured creditors, so your portion of the value of the coins will only be calculated based on a small portion of any leftovers after the secured creditors take their much larger share).

I keep seeing Bitcoin fanatics making this argument. You realize that there is no record of cash transactions right? Lets just forget for a minute that every Bitcoin transaction EVER is recorded in a distributed network that anyone can verify at any time, and pretend that Bitcoin transactions are like cash in that they are totally "untraceable". 
The IRS has decades of experience finding and putting people in jail for underreporting their taxes. Will some criminals get away with their crimes? Sure, but then swim smokes pot and never got busted for it either, doesn't mean that people never get busted for possession. 
What you are saying by saying "good luck with tracing that" is silly, the IRS doesn't trace cash transactions to put tax cheats in jail. When the taxman shows up and asked how you bought that Lamborghini if you can't show him the income you are going to jail for Tax Evasion. Bitcoin doesn't help or hinder tax evasion, and loudly yelling in your best Bro voice that it does does nothing to help the reputation of Bitcoin. The IRS will catch tax evaders in the post Bitcoin world the same way they always had, with audits and a careful accounting of your assets.
Reporting your income is a requirement of the law. Not reporting it is breaking the law. If you don't report it in Bitcoins or you don't report it because you are getting cash under the table for your crystal meth business, you are breaking the law. Pretending Bitcoin is some new foolproof way to break the law just shows your ignorance of the way the world works.

Nope, total myth. The law only states that creditors must accept legal tender as payment for debt (so that I can't loan you $100,000 USD to buy a house then say I only accept Euros when you show up to pay because Euros are up compared to the dollar this month) and that the government must accept legal tender for all "public charges, taxes and dues":
A private business can accept (or not) anything they want in exchange for their services, so long as you agree beforehand (again, to prevent the case where you provide a service for "$50" then later change your mind and decide you only accept Euros or whatever).
The whole mysticism surrounding "legal tender" tends to be fringe conspiracy theory stuff with no basis in reality and no understanding of what the law actually says.
EDIT: And you can agree to non-legal tender for loan payments as long as you agree to the contract prior to the loan and don't try to change your demands after the loan:  (affirmed by the courts in 2008:

"Is it not in GHASH's own interest to dial things back a notch?"
No, it's not. It's a tragedy of the commons style situation. If Ghash holds back then all they are doing is allowing someone else to come in at 51%. Since 51%+ is inevitable (if you don't do it, someone else will) then it will always be in your best interest to achieve it before someone else does. The only solution is for anyone is to race to 51% before anyone else can get there and have the power for yourself.
Look at it another way: Let's presume for a moment that Ghash.io sees themselves as the "good guys" who won't abuse the 51% attack. Then wouldn't it be absolutely in their best interest to maintain 51% so that no one else can achieve that and potentially attack the network? From their perspective they would be acting with a known "bad" situation (the knowledge that 51% is attainable and the damage it does to the price of BTC) but it's better than the potential of the far worse "bad" situation of someone *else* getting 51% and the damage it does to the BTC price *and* the potential that other person could abuse the system.

Uhm, what? They absolutely can and they will. In fact they do by default already. I can enter a contract to do work for gold, but I'm still taxed on that income, I just have to go through the added hassle of converting the value of gold to US Dollars to find out the tax rate and then convert some of my gold into dollars to pay the taxes. Bitcoin isn't some loophole to avoid taxes or regulations.
Everyone around here are so confused by what money is. People keep asking the rhetorical "What backs the dollar?" question like they've found some magic incantation that will destroy the dollar. The reality is what backs the dollar is it's utility to pay taxes. That's the whole "fiat" thing, it's not a demand on you to use cash, it's a limitation on the government requiring it to take US Dollars for taxes. That makes the dollar very useful because if you perform a transaction, that transaction will be taxed, thus your accounting is a million times simpler if the entire transaction is in the dollar, keeping you from having to convert from one unit into another and back again.

Says the guy offering exactly nothing to the conversation.
If the IRS is incapable of finding and convicting people people who don't report taxable income, then why is anyone reporting taxable income? What is the record that is created when I hand you $50 in cash? Is it recorded in the blockchain somewhere when I do that? You asked how they did it, I gave a good example of exactly how they track down people who suddenly have wealth that seemingly came from nowhere.
If reading about how they got Al Capone is too deep for you, go watch Breaking Bad. Why was Walter White not able to just take all that cash and spend it? Because the IRS notices when you suddenly have a bunch of money that appears out of nowhere. Hence the entire trade of laundering money, which, this will be a big news flash for you I'm sure, existed long before Bitcoin was even an idea.  It's not exactly rocket surgery to figure out that the guy living in the mansion in the Hamptons didn't get there from his pizza delivery job.

Its not that people "found a way around the government" to pirate in China, its that the government doesn't care and actively facilitates piracy.

That doesn't make your point any more valid, the reality is that you can't provide a single bit of evidence that there has ever been "a strong tendency to gold/silver" unless you mean a tendency to be [forced by a conquering empire to adopt their coinage ]( But there is no magical force behind gold that makes people gravitate towards it to use as a currency.
While the Romans conquered Europe and the Near East, moving the adoption of their gold/silver based economic system there, [China used copper until it replaced it with fiat]( and [Gold was never a major currency in the Americas prior to colonization](
So, in short, yes, there was "a strong tendency" for the Romans to force people to use Gold and Silver as a currency after they conquered them; however, aside from a rather limited eurocentric view of the world, there was no overall tendency for people to gravitate towards silver or gold. Huge portions of the world didn't use silver/gold until they were forced to through domination.

Nice buzz words!  I'm impressed!  What does it mean for me as the consumer that is an advantage over what I use everyday?  Extra buzzwords do not add value.


Now we're just talking in circles. In the comment just above mine I was told that low fees were not a feature, as I had pointed out that those low fees come without the advantages you get in normal CC transactions and thus you'd have to pay for 3rd parties to handle those services (thus eliminating the low fees and adding extra hassle).  If it's simply the low fee for international transfers then good luck getting everyone to change currencies for that!


I have a bicycle that is a replacement for your car, wanna trade?  What is the advantage of replacing stocks with bitcoins? Because bitcoins are awesome future money isn't a good enough reason for the average user.


This already exists today and is it really needed as a feature in currency? Is it going to really effect 99.9% of transactions?


Again, why is this feature something that we need in our currency? What is going to make the average Joe say they want to abandon the dollar because future money can verify their copyrights?


That's pure bullshit and totally unproven in any shape or form. If you mean it's bits that can stick around long term, my money has been represented by much less volatile bits in computers for well over a decade now. If you're trying to claim bitcoins are a hedge against inflation there is simply no evidence of this and no evidence there ever will be.  Bitcoins value is determined by the market's whim and you cannot predict it will be a long term store of value (and evidence shows thus far that it's far to volatile to be any kind of store of value).

Bitcoin doesn't work that way, if the contents of 40 million bitcoin wallets are stolen then that's just tough cookies for the owners.

"Because Bitcoin is a relatively new technology with no recorded precedents there is no way to determine how it will affect the economy."
"At the same time, there was a lot of investment in the companies of the technology sector. Stock shares rose dramatically. A lot of start-ups were created and the stock value was very high where floated. Newspapers and business leaders were starting to talk of new business models. Some even claimed that the old laws of economics did not apply anymore and that new laws had taken their place. They also claimed that the improvements in computer hardware and software would dramatically change the future, and that information is the most important value in the new economy."

Wow, you have yourself REALLY fooled.  I'm not sure if you looked at the gold price lately, but your chart was directly from the peak of the gold bubble.  Nothing stops the volatility of gold.. which is why it's so volatile.. hence the rise and subsequent crash in gold prices.  That chart you linked that shows a high at 2900 inr/g in April 2012?  Right now it's selling for 2400 inr/g a year later. And that comparison masks a huge part of the gold crash because the rupee has lost 20% of it's value compared to USD over the same time period.  In USD gold is down 33%!  In the same time period the USD has suffered nearly a 1.5% inflation!  Your $1 invested in gold would be worth 60 cents.. your $1 you just held on to in cash would be worth 98 cents!  I thought you said you were savvy with money?


Uhm, if you look at 50 years of history then gold is a really really really crappy hedge against inflation, and aside from crazy speculative bubbles (with their subsequent crashes) it's stayed pretty even with the dollar.  You don't really know what you are talking about:
"Inflation hedge? Nope. A chart of gold prices versus year-to-year changes in inflation – one measure of unexpected inflation — shows a random cloud. Another chart showing the rolling 10-year return on gold versus Consumer Price Index also shows a random pattern. Trailing annual returns to gold investors ranged between almost negative 6% per year to nearly 20% between 1985 and 2012, while inflation rates showed a more narrow range of 2.3% to 7.3% a year. Conclusion: Investors can’t hedge against unexpected inflation by holding gold, since the returns from gold appear to have no clear relationship to inflation."

I understand your point, I just think you are choosing to be myopic to avoid the nasty realities that face the entire bitcoin transaction. You are saying "one tiny piece of the overall puzzle is more secure therefore good" and I'm saying "yeah, but that tiny bit of increased security comes with the cost of losing the insurance on the *rest* of the process and it's not a worthwhile tradeoff." Then you keep reiterating the point that one bit of the puzzle is more secure so reasons.
You don't have to go much further than the front page of to see hassles happening daily to bitcoin users that would be prevented with credit cards and there are only a handful of bitcoin transactions happening worldwide daily. Hell just yesterday there was a dispute between a customer and a merchant over the price differential of BTC from the day the order was placed to the day the order was ready, with the merchant holding the item and the BTC and threatening to keep both unless the customer ponied up more coins. The customer has no chance at that point, and it's a risk that does not exist with CC transactions. Every single BTC transaction has this risk, you are either giving money to someone in advance hoping that they deliver or they are delivering product in advance hoping that you will pay. This is just simply not a risk with CC, as it works as a third party escrow that protects both sides of the transaction.
But tell me again how when the merchant already has your money they are secure and you don't have to worry.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:55:46


No, a savvy investor would put their non-liquid money into a series of investments that has actual production value (hence why gold is a niche market and stocks are not). Their liquid money would be far too inconvenient to move into CC for the potential minimal gains. 
Also you make a statement that doesn't bear out in practice: "If you are savvy with money, you will quickly realize that the interest from your bank account doesn't keep up with inflation. Even Bond rates don't keep with inflation. So, what do you do? Move your savings into CC."
To avoid minimal inflation in a stable currency you'd move your money into a highly volatile currency and call yourself savvy with money? The dollar I had in my wallet last night may have lost a fraction of it's value overnight to inflation, but the bitcoin I had last night is worth 25% less as of the time of this posting. Somehow, because reasons, the minimal loss of my dollar to inflation is bad because the fed works to keep the currency stable (and the fed is a bad word) but the 25% I lost in bitcoins is good because freedom or something?
Further, the comic is cute but it is completely incorrect and completely misunderstands why offshore banking is attractive to wealthy people (stability and tax havens, first and foremost).

You realize that Forbes magazine isn't a monolithic entity, right?  You responded with an opinion column on Forbes, the article I linked cites its sources and it's an actual researched study by actual economists:
The article you linked cites as its only source a half baked website that cooks numbers to better suit his political agenda:


No, it doesn't.  Gold, historically, has matched the dollar over time.
Let me ask you a question:  How can you possibly think gold would grow in value over time? If I buy an ounce of gold today, put it in my safe at home, come back and retrieve it in 100 years, how many ounces of gold will I have? What makes that new quantity of gold that I have in 100 years more valuable than it is today?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:27:01


Again, magic. Volatility of the dollar is stopped by the fact that the fed controls the supply, not because it "backs" the dollar. What would Switzerland do to stop the volatility of Bitcoin? What would it mean to "back" Bitcoin in this instance?


But I can also look at my dollar over that same time frame and see virtually no volatility compared to Bitcoin.  Which one is a safer bet for long term stability?  With Bitcoin I may or may not beat inflation, with the dollar my buying power does not suffer the same volatile rollercoaster. If I want to take a risk I may decide to invest in Bitcoin (no, I wouldn't, I'm not a fool, if I wanted to take a risk I'd invest it as capital into a company that produces.. but someone who is a fool may decide to take a risk on Bitcoin) but other than a history of attracting a "bigger fool" what do I *gain* from a Bitcoin investment? If I buy a bitcoin today, what does it become tomorrow? It's the same Bitcoin, right? I can hope that tomorrow I find someone who wants to buy it for more than I did but I could hope the same thing about a dollar bill.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:35:21
Which then belies the entire "future currency" thing. All of the nice little things that just work in my transactions today are going to be stripped away and I'm going to have to find a third party to support them. Bitcoin transaction costs will "cost less" when you only look at the actual transaction, but I'm going to have to pay out of pocket to all the third parties that supply those services rather than have the service costs as part of the system as it exists today. And now it adds a ton of hassle that doesn't exist today for either the merchant or the customer.

Yes, never before in the history of time has a new commodity started trading in an otherwise established market. You are pretty much proving Krugman's point.

The reality is, despite the "impressive sounding" technology back end, Bitcoin is still subject to regular old economic forces.

You didn't really answer the question, it all boils down to this magic statement you made:
"It now becomes attractive for people to funnel their money into Switzerland in order to gain easy access to CC."
Assuming I can buy nothing in Country B, my country, with CC, then why is it attractive to move my money to Country A to get CC?  You mangle the same point in your chart when Both A and B allow CC by simply stating that "CC takes over Fiat".  If both A and B have consumption taxes like sales tax or VAT, then what advantage do I see in converting every transaction to CC to make the transaction, the back to Fiat to pay the tax?
Both of your examples have people choosing CC over Fiat because reasons.

This is where we pretend that the internet was born of the "free market", where the "free market" is the magic that creates stuff like the internet. This entire video goes against everything in the anarcho-libertarian playbook! If you post stuff like this, the next thing you know, people will stop suggesting that democracy can be fixed by weighting your vote by the amount of wealth you control!!!1!

No, he's saying that the underlying recovery from the dot com bubble was weak in the business sector, but that consumer spending was maintained and made it less bad than it could have been.  Because at the time (in 2002) the business sector still hadn't recovered and wouldn't be recovering for awhile that to maintain consumer spending (and thus hiding the weak business sector) Greenspan would have to increase consumer wealth through artificial means (a housing bubble that gave people paper wealth that did not really exist).
His article is saying that he didn't think that Greenspan would be able to maintain a housing bubble long enough for business to recover to the point that the bubble deflation would avoid another recession. He was not prescribing a housing bubble for recovery, he was saying that in order to maintain the current policy (tax cuts for the wealthy during an economic downturn being buoyed by the middle class) Greenspan would "need" to create a bubble.  To do otherwise would mean a policy change (scrapping the tax cuts and go with more government investment, which would of course be Krugman's policy proposal and would have avoided the housing bubble).
I can see where you could misread the quote out of context, but you linked the article and it's pretty clear that he's not calling for pumping up a housing bubble, but instead saying that Greenspan's policy will be to create a housing bubble which Krugman was (rightfully) doubtful will work:
"But wishful thinking aside, I just don't understand the grounds for optimism. Who, exactly, is about to start spending a lot more? At this point it's a lot easier to tell a story about how the recovery will stall than about how it will speed up. And while I like movies with happy endings as much as the next guy, a movie isn't realistic unless the story line makes sense."

And you fail to understand how chargebacks work. Merchants face the risk right now. If someone uses a stolen credit card at Target and you report it to your card company, Target doesn't get the payment and they are out the merchandise. They already have the incentive to be secure. If your bitcoins get stolen and spent at Target then the thief has the item and Target has the money and there is nothing you can do.

Uhm.. You don't understand what he's saying? He was EXACTLY spot on there, predicting in 2002 that Greenspan's policies would create a housing bubble and that Greenspan was using that to hide an otherwise lackluster economy. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED! In 2005 he predicted the bubble would pop, and that's what happened.
I'm unsure why you think catching him predicting that the policy that created the housing bubble would create a housing bubble is bad but you are proving my point that Krugman is better than you at macroeconomics. Thanks!

You don't understand how it works? Then you'd make a great Bitcoin investor! My suggestion: buy and then hold until you get to the moon.
