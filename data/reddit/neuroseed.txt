There always is some kind of flaw in each technology. Within amount of 10 details 1 is defective - it’s a rule that work on any factory. There is no limit to perfection. Such attacks will give an opportunity to make a system better.

A good idea is to use bitcoin as a means of investment. How history shows the course is  still growing and those who have bought bitcoin for $ 200 in their time and have sold for $ 300 have good grown. It is only needed to be extremely careful as at any other investing.

 Last year I made a gift for the New Year to my ex-girlfriend in the amount of $ 300 in bitcoins. She was terribly offended at me because she wanted a ringlet. Now it's 1700 bucks and it should be sufficient enough for a ring, earrings, chain and so on.

If I take into account my own experience in the use of blocking technology, then I simply did not have the power to pass by the article. Our team NeuroSeed uses the blockchain actively. I can say one thing - it simplifies a lot of problems. I'm glad that the technology is developing.

The main  feature  of Bitcoin is independence from everyone and everything absolutely.I think it's a bad idea to control it somehow differently than the original algorithms. Bitcoin is an ideal example of developed capitalism, where there are no regulators and the price is regulated only by the formula “demand  is equal to supply”. The market itself regulates the cost of Bitcoin, so  price then grows or falls.

It looks like they talk about the ideas of the next Internet generation - namely the need to change the system of DNS servers as well as the way to login in using blockchain technology. So you can refuse security certificates for websites and have only one account for all Internet resources. The idea is very promising and its implementation will make a revolution in the Internet space…...

Undoubtedly, the course of crypto currency  is rapidly growing but should  not  take a loan or sell a house for the sake of it. Because it's still risky. Maybe the agiotage will soon decrease in this direction, but, maybe,  will increase. Time will show.

Quantum computers are able to make more computations than personal computers or even ASICs farm. We know that Bitcoin’s network change it’s difficulty every 2016 blocks. If quantum computers connected to the network as a miner, the network would adapt to it after 2016 blocks. After that Bitcoin will work as usual: 10 minutes for each block. But most part of network’s hashrate will be property of a quantum computer. So no one except quantum computer’s owner would get reward per block. Although he will manage all transactions in the network. So it wouldn’t be a decentralized system. I don’t want even imagine this. I believe that in far future there would be a lot of quantum computers and Bitcoin still decentralized and independent.

It is quite logical that the equipment manufacturers respond adequately to the level of the market. It is very good. I think that the next crypto-currencies will appear taking into account the presence of GPU-capacities and the possible development of video cards in mining, artificial intelligence, etc.

It is very good that this topic is raised. If they can make the machine able  to identify images,  to learn new solutions to all sorts of problems without the human help, then in the future the development will bring many useful functions to the man. But what is the  question? Will they be able to bring the development to market?  It is too expensive as they say in the article.

Hi, Veqtor! It's a good question! To protect user's data we have chosen the best way, which is being tested now. Our desision  means use of TensorFlow, that is also being tested. You have bad experience on using other varaints? Why? We are ready to discuss your experience. Have any advice?

I think it’s a news, because it’ll allow to make over 7 transactions per second. But in sake of changing the size of block you need to change the operation of the protocol, which will bring so-called “hardfork”. And with it most users of the network will have to agree, or at least the main miners and stock exchanges.

Our developers know about this problem. We are looking for the most productive way to solve the problem. If you are interested in this topic and you are ready to share your experience, we are glad to cooperate with you.

Sounds that 21st century brings us the rapid development of cryptocurrencies... but isn't it scarcity to invest fiat??
