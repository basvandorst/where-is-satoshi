I am in highschool and I only had like 1000worth few days ago. I am mining but I am curious about how you as a student afforded to invest 5000, if I may ask?

Thanks for answering this, is there a place to learn about these type of concepts?like the basics?

Quick question: If I want to make the most profit from trading Zcash to bitcoin and believe that bitcoin is the future and gonna hodl it, I should look into a high price of BTC/ZEC pair instead of ZEC/USD right?

If what is hsppening at Coinbase is insider trading, why didn't they do it less suspiciously by buying BCH, announcing the news, and then proceed with the integration after a few days so that everyone is happy?
And how can anyone fall for buying BCH when they can see that they can't  withdraw?
Thanks !

One option.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:17:53
Wait.. I thought both are yellow?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:10:42
You think it is not over yet?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:58:18
Damn 14000...I hope you are right.

Can't you fund usd on coinbase too?

How is buying high a better entry point?
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:00:41
Low values in bitcoin's case means low amounts too.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:42:59
I wouldn't buy a hardware wallet to store small amounts, it is not worth it for me, but it's your choice.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:55:57
I actually tried to make sense of it lol.
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:55:33
They say always buy, there could some dips coming though.
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:34:09
What? I was saying that there are other secure options to store Bitcoin especially if the amounts are low.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:47:08
We are talking about the possible scenarios that could happen if I convert BTC to USDT right?
For the second scenario: it would still give slightly more profit than hodling btc?
3rd one: why would I lose money If it did not dip and stayed at the same rate? I would just exchange the usdt back to btc. Or did you mean I would lose through the exhange fee? 
Just needed some concepts corrected.
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:53:34
I understand the long term investment, what I meant is won't I make more profit if I exchanged it right now to a more steady currency like Ltc or usdt, Wait until Btc dips (we all know it is very likely) and then buy btc again? Isn't it easy profit?
Btw I really appreciate your response I was looking for more than an hour for a assuring answer!
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:42:37
Alright I am not gonna buy, but now I got someone to blame if it skyrocketed.
EDIT: I bought.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:59:52
You don't lose the value if you don't sell.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:44:50
I would say this is the bottom.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:00:03
Bull traps or it could just be people buying the crash.
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:57:15
newbie here, what am I supposed to do with the bitcoin I have? 
1-convert to USD?and wait until it dips and buy again?
2-what if it didn't dip and instead kept increasing?
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:45:39
Is that because of your job? If I may ask.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:34:51
What do you prefer for knowing more/being up to date with the latest Bitcoin analysis?
 I feel like this subreddit isn't active on hourly basis for latest updates and posts rarely get upvoted by a huge amount(so I can know what is the dominant opinion). Why is it like that?

OP's said 


which suggests that he is gradually going in with fractions only.
