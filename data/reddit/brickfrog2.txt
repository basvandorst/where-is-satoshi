The payment is in progress. Coinbase already initiated a ACH transfer from your bank account to Coinbase that normally takes something like 3-5 business days to complete. If the ACH transfer fails for whatever reason then Coinbase charges the CC on file.
Technically since today is Saturday I'm not sure if the ACH transfer actually got started yet, could be Monday when it gets started officially.. not 100% sure on that. ACH is a U.S. banking system so it's not going to process on weekends/holidays.

That's a lot of PP transactions, pretty sure they'll want to investigate them if you do that a lot. At that point they'll want to freeze/cancel the PP accounts involved since they consider anything bitcoin-related as against their TOS.
*Maybe* if both parties keep using different PP accounts.. seems like too much work just to use PP as the platform for payment.

Slightly off-topic, I used to use SnapSwap to deposit USD into BitStamp from the U.S. (SnapSwap USD --&gt; Ripple --&gt; BitStamp USD)
Anyone know any alternatives to SnapSwap for this usage in the U.S.? And/or other ways to deposit USD into BitStamp from the U.S.? (Anything aside from attempting international bank wire transfers)

A BTC withdraw there isn't going to happen nowadays. You'll have better luck trading for another crypto &amp; withdrawing that instead.
Even worse, if you're not verified there then the tier 0 withdraw limit is only $100/month. Even converting to another crypto isn't going to help you withdraw 3 BTC there anytime soon.

So far BTC is the only coin I found that Cryptsy won't withdraw. Everything else works fine, though LTC withdraws do seem to take ~24 hrs last I tried.
MYR, DOGE, PPC all had near-instant withdraws last I tried. But in general you should be OK if you avoid BTC withdraws.

Not sure how it'll work in your specific situation but I've read that PP does pull $$ out of your connected/last used bank accounts if the chargeback is initiated outside of PP.  e.g. they do this when Ebay transactions are disputed.  Not sure if they do that if it's just a dispute initiated within PP itself, I guess you should read through their TOS.  I'd be curious how it works out for you.
Is the attached bank account your main account, or just a extra bank account?  I'd suggest moving the $$ out of that account for the time being, maybe even close it, &amp; see how it goes.  No one should attach their main bank accounts to PP or any other 3rd party payment services IMO.


99% sure PP does not allow you to change bank account details when you're in the middle of a dispute.

AFAICT this sort of behavior isn't even common with fiat BANKS. None of my BANKS have asked me what I'm using my fiat $$ withdrawals for, let alone given me an ultimatum to answer or close the account.
I get that a regular fiat bank might start asking questions if you're doing a lot of $10k+ transfers, or doing bitcoin-related business, but Coinbase is going above &amp; beyond what even a BANK does IMO.

I think Coinbase *is* one of the faster ways to buy 50 BTC quickly.  Once you're Level 2 verified a 50 BTC buy would only take you however long the ACH transfer takes (typically 2-5 business days).
If you're not verified &amp; need 50 BTC like right *now*, I'm not sure what to suggest offhand besides LBC (that's a big purchase though, may be better to do it in chunks?).
There's also  but I don't think you'll be able to do a 50 BTC buy through there without cleaning out their sell orders, frankly.
Bistamp would be a good bet if you're OK waiting on the international wire transfers.  And there's also CampBX/Coinmkt/VoS if you want to do it in chunks.

What is the exact message it's giving you?  If it's just saying you need to be verified, then you need to go through verification.  No way to get around that with MtGox.
Actually, if you're not verified on MtGox yet you may as well get started now, it'll take least a few weeks if not more.  You can't withdraw BTC without verification anyway.
@_date: 2014-01-05 17:13:45
I've wondered this myself.  Since they already have all the proper MSB licensing they're technically already a step ahead  of most people.
The only downside I can think of is that they are required to ask for your ID for any transactions (certainly in the U.S., not sure about other countries).  It's not a *huge* downside, but that'd definitely put off some buyers who aren't used to having to provide extra info to do a cash purchase.

You should assume that you'll be paying taxes (capital gains?) so plan for that.  If your bank sees huge deposits of USD like that they *will* report that to IRS, I think it's anything over $10k.
If you're looking to do particularly huge transactions definitely get in touch with Secondmarket.  Otherwise, I'd suggest just getting set up for Coinbase or Bitstamp if you only plan on trading chunks of BTC to USD.  You don't *need* to cash out the whole thing at once, unless you need to buy a mansion ASAP &amp; need those $831000+ ;)
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:09:12


That doesn't sound right.. without verification you can indeed deposit BTC into MtGox as well as trade.  No verification needed for that..  you only need verification if you intend to withdraw any BTC or fiat later.
Since the account did not have 2FA enabled it sounds more plausible that someone simily got into your account (it happens a lot at the bitcoin exchanges without 2FA enabled)
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:50:21
No personal experience, but the gist I got from the [epic MtGox bitcointalk thread] ( is that MtGox is currently taking 4+ weeks or so for EUR SEPA transfers.  So, it's not impossible to withdraw that way, just a bit slow.
But you better verify before doing *anything* there, that alone may take a few months.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I think dd itself would just write the data, wouldn't actually wipe the old data completely.
Hmm... it's a *longshot*, but you could try running Photorec on that flash drive &amp; see what turns up.  You could also grab an image of the flash drive (via dd or ddrescue) &amp; run Photorec on the image file, in the case you don't want to run photorec on your flash drive directly.
There's also Testdisk if you want to try recovering the partition(s) before you overwrote the flash drive.
Just some ideas you could try.. depending on how many times you overwrote the flash drive your odds won't be too good, but you never know!

re: 2FA, can I ask what he used to link as a phone number to Coinbase?  Unfortunately, even with Authy or Google Authenticator, Coinbase still sends the 2FA text code to the linked phone number.  So in essence there's two 2FA entry points.
If it was linked to a regular phone number, do you know if his phone was lost/stolen at some point and/or had malware on it?
Or, if it was linked to a Google Voice phone number, was his Google account accessed by a 3rd party at some point?  (technically in this case it would be best to lock down the Google account with its own 2FA, not that it matters at the moment)

There's some other threads about this, one commenter mentioned this is probably b/c Humble Bundle uses Coinbase for their bitcoin purchases.  (Coinbase is U.S. only)..

You probably just need to keep waiting for now.  You won't be able to withdraw bitcoin from MtGox until you're verified, there's no way around that.
Unfortunately they're so slow &amp; backlogged that it may indeed take a while.
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:43:02
Eh, I wouldn't be against it if it was tied to something like FB, in that you already know the people looking you up.
Otherwise, you'd not only need to centralize the ability to see users via face/bitcoin address/GPS proximity, but the idea of announcing that stuff to complete strangers is a bit unnerving.

Avoid Chase &amp; Capital One.
Out of the big banks, Wells Fargo might be the best bet.  None of the U.S. banks are "friendly" IMO, but WF seems to be the most tolerant.  At least a few crypto companies have accounts with them too (e.g. SnapSwap, Litetree, others?).  Speaking of which, I've always kind of wondered who Coinbase uses for banking in the U.S., considering they do a lot of ACH transfers..
Besides that, people always say credit unions are a relatively safe bet.  But I'm not sure that would apply for a business account.
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:37:58
You can't do much of anything right now.  However, if your MtGox account is verified &amp; you're able to do JPY withdrawals or EUR SEPA bank transfers then you should be able to withdraw cash. (so.. basically Japan &amp; some EUR countries)
Otherwise make sure you're verified on MtGox, afterwards you can withdraw bitcoin when/if MtGox re-enables bitcoin withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:45:00


And Coinmkt.  And maybe Cryptsy if they ever roll out USD trading.  There's a few others too but they're still in beta I think (Buttercoin, Coinsetter).
CampBX &amp; Litetree are technically options too, but probably best to avoid for now.
@_date: 2014-02-05 04:38:43


Yes.  If you're unverified you better get started now, it'll take at least a month for them to even get around to looking at your verification docs!
@_date: 2014-02-05 05:29:57
I think you're getting confused w/ ZipZap?  e.g. from Ripple's [blog post] (
[SnapSwap] ( allows for cash deposits at any Wells Fargo bank.  (I think you can also ACH into their bank account, but I've never attempted that)  The fee is .99% + $.30 which makes it very cheap to deposit USD into Ripple.
However, sending the USD to Bitstamp does lose some $$ during the conversion..I'm not exactly a Ripple expert so I'm not sure how/why that is, but it definitely knocks off maybe $6-$9 from what you started with.  The overall fees are still *way* cheaper than an international bank wire, plus you're not involving your bank in the wire transfer to Slovenia, so overall I consider it totally viable for getting USD into Bitstamp :)  Wish more exchanges allowed for Ripple USD deposits!
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:09:03
Sorry, this pretty much happens on most bitcoin exchanges/services for accounts without 2FA enabled.  e.g. feel free to search for people whose BTC-E accounts were also hacked when they didn't have 2FA enabled.
CampBX isn't going to be able to do much about this.  You could ask them for the IP address that last accessed your account, maybe?  But it won't be much use, most likely the hacker avoided using his/her own IP address to access your account.
But at least it was only .285 BTC lost?  A lot of people who forget to enable 2FA tend to lose way more than that, so you lucked out there at least :)

You can easily do a cash deposit into Ripple &amp; have the funds transferred into Bitstamp, for example.  I don't know of another way to deposit cash for use at Bitstamp.  Plus nowadays you can technically just trade USD for BTC inside Ripple itself.

?  The general consensus is 6 months or more, aka "indefinite", when doing wire transfers from MtGox to a U.S. bank account.  (presumably you're in the U.S. since you're comparing to Coinbase)

No, sorry, no one reputable would take Paypal.  Currency/cryptocurrency transactions are against Paypal's Acceptable Use Policy, you'd be taking a pretty big risk going that route.
With Bitstamp you can deposit via international wire transfer, though that means you may need to get your bank account set up first.  You can also deposit USD through Ripple but I'm not sure how to do that in Japan (maybe someone in Japan can answer that one).

Oh yeah, a lot of people have had the same "problem".  Just do a search in :/
MtGox is so backlogged that it's taking them a very long time to do any sort of verification, let alone fiat withdrawals.  They're just not worth dealing with at this point, at least not until they get their shit together.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:35:30
Hmm... yeah, in that case give Kraken a shot.  I know for sure you can send/receive XRP with Kraken, but not quite sure if you can send BTC via Ripple to Kraken.
BTW, Kraken *is* working on becoming a full Ripple gateway from what I've read, but they haven't said anything about when that'll happen exactly.
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:52:08
If they have the system working correctly there's no reason it's not possible.  Though it does mean for *very large* withdrawals there may be a delay, depending how they handle those.
Doesn't seem all that different from brick and mortar banks, they certainly wouldn't have enough on-site if every account holder were to suddenly want to cash out all their accounts.

Presumably you have evidence that a bitcoin mobile wallet does logins off a SSL connection?  That's what your Pineapple link is all about.
Also.. are you referring to web-based wallets, or mobile wallet apps?  I'm not following how this applies to wallet apps, unless you're claiming that they're transmitting private keys over wifi, over a non-encrypted connection?


Can't keylog an encrypted connection, unless you're the NSA ;)  Now, if you're saying someone can hack your phone &amp; then keylog it.. yeah maybe that's possible if there are 0 day attacks, unpatched software, etc..  But that has nothing to do with public wifi, right?

Ripple is somewhat useful for getting USD into Bitstamp but the whole affair isn't nearly as smooth as just using Coinbase.
Though for the record I don't even have any issues w/ using Coinbase, mostly just listed the current options for USD users in the U.S.  Eventually BitSimple will be the Coinbase competitor IMO, though they really need ACH to actually get there.  None of this domestic/international bank wire BS.

If you're doing your MtGox withdraws via JPY (in Japan) or SEPA (in Europe) that would be your best bet, but still plan on waiting maybe 4+ weeks to ever get the funds out of MtGox.  Outside of those options you won't ever get your funds out of MtGox (especially if you're in the U.S.).
The other thing is you need to get verified on MtGox before attempting any of that, that alone can take a few months.
In short: Bad idea, but you could try if you wanted.

If you're in the U.S. just avoid MtGox.
You should search around this has been asked a lot.  But basically, you can't withdraw USD to a U.S. bank account from MtGox, just won't happen.  In theory people claim 6+ months, but I'm not sure who actually does it &amp; waits that long just to see if it pans out..
MtGox does process JPY &amp; EUR SEPA withdrawals slowly (might take at least 4 weeks or more) but they do those eventually.

Two things:
 1. Check with Authy &amp; make sure there weren't any other devices added to his account, and/or his Authy account wasn't accessed by a 3rd party somehow.  Remember if you're using Authy then Authy itself becomes another attack vector.
 2. Coinbase still sends a 2FA code via text to the linked phone number.  Was this his regular iPhone phone number (AT&amp;T, etc.)?  Or was it Google Voice or something else?

All the wallets already have strong passphrase encryption, correct?  If you're worried, I'd suggest doing backups of all of them offline (e.g. USB stick).  Then you can temporarily remove the wallets from the Mac if you like, &amp; copy them back onto there later on.
Just make sure you have your game plan down re: backup &amp; restore (might be good to do a test run so you understand how to it).

CampBX doesn't even have an official bank account anymore.  USD withdrawals from there involve a $20 money order that you may or may not receive in a few weeks.

How often does someone get arrested for *just* money laundering alone?  Usually arrests happen b/c of a bigger connection, e.g. funding SR or similar, &amp; it just happens to be that money laundering was going on at the same time.

Not sure what you're asking, exactly.  Are you looking for exchanges that trade altcoins *and* accept fiat?  Offhand, check out

 * Vault of Satoshi

Keep in mind cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are against PP's user agreement.  Because of this they're not going to try too hard to resolve the dispute in your favor since you're already breaking their rules.  If anything, there's a chance they'll suspend your PP account now.

If you want to buy gift cards with BTC that is easy enough.  Not sure exactly what is available in Brazil but there are places like     etc.


That is difficult, what you're asking for isn't always legal.  (maybe it is in Brazil, not sure).  I've seen people sell prepaid CCs, like in bitcointalk or other websites, so maybe check there.  Also try Googling "bitcoin card", there are a few sites but I have no idea how legit they are (honestly I've assumed they are scams, but maybe you can let us know!).
@_date: 2014-01-16 05:30:25
Not sure about specifically prepaid, but these sites all deal w/ CCs.  No idea whether they're in the U.S. though.

There's also  but I think they're more about gift card CC vs regular prepaid.
BTW, if you're in the U.S. you really should just use the other avaiilable methods.  e.g. Coinbase is great as long as you have a checking account.

Interesting.. but not the "first time" ;)

They take a very long time to verify, sorry.  You're just going to have to wait until they get around to it.  Could be a few more weeks, or a few more months..
If you search in you'll see that many people have the same problem with MtGox.  The issue is compounded b/c you can't withdraw anything without verification there, so your bitcoin is essentially stuck there.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:52:41

@_date: 2014-01-30 18:46:06
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  The way MtGox is set up you need to drag the 2FA thing into Log In, Withdrawal, *and* Security Center if you want to be super-secure.
Outside of that maybe it's API related.

You prob don't need to be too worried.  I just meant that you double-checked what you copied/pasted for the addresses in question.
I don't use Multibit, but for most bitcoin clients your receiving address(es) would be in the "receive" or "request" address section.  It's unlikely you managed to copy some other random address ;)

Why are we still pretending there are no U.S. exchanges?
Lets be honest here, users at MtGox were either
  A. People who started out with Bitcoin *way* back, before there were any other viable exchanges, &amp; simply kept using what they already know.
  B. New to bitcoin, &amp; though MtGox was the only place to buy/sell bitcoin.
 C. Thought they could make a quick buck by selling BTC for the artificial MtGox price
 D. In Japan

On an Android device you can try the Coinbase Trader app.

Not offhand, just playing the waiting game for now..  I've got an account there but am not allowed to verify (I think to level 2 is it?) for fiat transfers.
You can technically still use Kraken for non USD stuff, until then may be better to stick to another exchange w/ real USD transfers for the moment.  But Kraken is pretty legit, once they finish rolling out to all 50 states they'll be hard to beat!
For now I'm sticking to Bitstamp, &amp; also trying out Coinmkt.  Also have an account at CampBX but they've got their own bank issues ATM, prob better to avoid them right now.  Vault of Satoshi looks promising too.
@_date: 2014-03-22 18:54:26
They're OK for limited amounts of BTC.  Coinbase is already more secure than a lot of people's home computers or even traditional banking websites, IMO.
There are of course a lot of security precautions you could take to avoid any issues, e.g.
 * Do not save user/password or 2FA on any web browsers
 * Speaking of 2FA, absolutely set one up (Authy or Google Authenticator, preferably)
 * Enable 2FA for all withdrawal attempts from Coinbase
 * Strong, unique, passwords for both your Coinbase account &amp; your linked email account(s)
 * Enable 2FA for your email (yes, this is a common attack vector)
 * If you're using Google Voice, absolutely enable 2FA on that Google account too
 * Keep API disabled unless it's something you need (you mentioned this already)
 * Open up a spare checking account &amp; link *that* to Coinbase.. if all your other security precautions fail, at least your main bank account won't get cleaned out with the attacker attempting to do large buys.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:49:54

To buy/sell bitcoin.  (with USD, for example)  Exchanges are more geared for doing lots of trading which may or may not be what you're looking for.


No.  Sending/receiving bitcoin just requires the sender's &amp; receiver's own bitcoin addresses.  (maybe not so different from just sending some text to an email address)


Kind of an open question right now.  In that sense you may want to avoid BTC-E &amp; CampBX, the others are pretty legit (Bitstamp, Kraken, Coinmkt, Vault of Satoshi, etc.).

You may want to change pw from another computer.
Also do you know if you saved email user/password on any browsers/computers/phones anywhere else?  Could be a compromised machine somewhere else.  Depending on how crappy your email provider is, a logged in session somewhere else will keep them in your email account :/
I'd suggest changing some of these accounts (e.g. Cryptsy) over to a more secure email account, maybe GMail w/ 2FA enabled.  But don't do that until you know your current email is no longer compromised (otherwise the attacker gets all the change email requests).

Strong email password, &amp; you *really* should get 2FA enabled on that email account.

This is incorrect.  However I have read that MtGox users *before* the policy change can still withdraw BTC without being verified, I'm going to guess your account on MtGox has existed for probably over 6-12 months.  (this doesn't apply to fiat withdrawals, you'd always need to be verified for that)
Newer users (like OP, presumably) won't be able to withdraw BTC without verification.

You're talking about Coinbase, meaning you're in the U.S.  Generally speaking you're not going to be able to withdraw any fiat ($$) from MtGox to a U.S. bank account.
Being unable to withdraw $$ from MtGox leaves buying more bitcoin on MtGox as the only withdrawal option.  More buyers means the price goes up.
Of course, MtGox is somewhat processing fiat withdrawals for banks outside the U.S., but it's still pretty slow.  So even outside of the U.S. if you want your funds in a reasonable timeframe it means buying bitcoin to get your funds out of MtGox.

I don't know about licensing, but Coinmkt does seem to allow deposits from all U.S. states.  (via USPS money orders or domestic wire transfers)

And/or social engineer some sort of sale/trade for BTC now that the attacker has control of your account.  There's a lot of different ways this could go..

Your passwords are compromised for sure (that's how they got the 2FA request).  You may want to think about *how* they even got that info &amp; fix it.
In the meantime, is your email locked down w/ 2FA?  Did you install anything risky on your computer, phone?  Or did you log into one of the exchanges via a compromised computer at some point?

Realistically the only way to get anything out of MtGox, if you're in the U.S., is to buy BTC &amp; transfer *that* out of there.  Yes, your BTC buy price will be higher, but it's b/c of this reason that it's higher at MtGox than at other places so don't act surprised ;)

You might want to check out  for comparisions.
Bitstamp's trade volume is huge (in fact, the biggest exchange for USD trading now) so they're a pretty good exchange to get set up at.  Downside is you'd need to do deposits/withdrawals via international wire transfer, that may or may not be easy/expensive depending on your bank.  They also do USD deposits/withdrawals via Ripple but that may be a bit much to deal with if you're just starting out (you'd need to look at getting yourself set up with a Ripple wallet &amp; on SnapSwap at a minimum).  Personally I've been transferring USD into there via Ripple, no complaints :)
Coinmkt has a *much* smaller trade volume &amp; their web interface's performance is way slower than the other exchanges' websites.  But as a usable exchange they've been fairly reliable, rarely have issues with them.  With both Coimmkt &amp; CampBX I've been depositing USD via USPS money orders, it sound kind of dumb but I find it's a pretty easy way to deal with doing deposits without getting banks involved.  (VoS also accepts money order deposits if you're curious)  Coinmkt recently implemented deposits via domestic wire transfer so that's a new deposit option worth checking out.
re: CampBX, I've never had problems with them.  Their trade volume is higher than Coinmkt &amp; their web interface is loads faster.  But with their current bank issues I'm not sure if they're the best place to get set up on unless you're willing to take on some risk (not to mention, forgot about getting USD out of there for now).

Or even worse, allow any disputes to go through later since buyer/seller protection does not apply to bitcoin-related transactions, plenty of people have lost both $$ &amp; BTC that way.

Really?  Come on, if this is a student they know full well what they're risking irregardless of bitcoin.  There's no reason they shouldn't be banned from the comp lab at a minimum.
..and yes, I've been kicked out of college computer labs before, so I've been on that side of the fence ;)

Offhand I think(?) it should be possible, similar to the guys that set up currency exchange shops.  I'm not sure on all that's involved re: getting registered as MSB, though I think officially you'd need to check everyone's identity.. at least that's how the currency exchange shops in the U.S. do it.
You'd be similar to [Coin Cafe] ( since they allow for people to come by their offices to buy BTC.

If you're specifically looking for exchanges in the U.S. then [CoinMKT] ( may be the most reputable that can do USD deposits/withdrawals.

Eventually we'll also have [Kraken] ( [Coinsetter] ( and/or [Buttercoin] ( depending when they start trading in USD in the U.S. and/or are out of beta.

Don't worry about mining.  If you're thinking bitcoin is "free money" then this won't interest you much, frankly.  (the people actually doing real bitcoin mining have to put in $5k-$10k+ on equipment to do this &amp; won't necessarily earn back those $5k-$10k+)
Beyond that check out the sidebar.  I also like  as a good intro.

Yes..sort of.. you *could* link CB to an empty bank account, but you do realize you'd be paying your bank's overdraft fee/NSF fee PLUS the surcharge CB adds to the CC buy.  This could get expensive, &amp; CB will likely boot you off if you do this enough times.
There are certain sites that deal specifically with CC if that's your thing, of course they have their own high fees..

Well, you've heard of Coinbase now ;)  A lot of exchange wallets don't transmit TX immediately either (but to be fair, who would use an exchange as a bitcoin wallet, that's crazy!).
I agree the above example is a Coinbase issue, however that becomes a customer service issue for OP's wine bar.  What should OP do in the case a customer pays, but the TX never came through?  I don't have a straight answer for that scenario, at least not one involving the customer to accidentally double-pay (e.g. if they give up &amp; just pay with cash/CC).
Only thing I can think of is for OP to have spare wallets on hand for slow web wallet scenarios.  e.g. Coinbase-to-Coinbase would be very quick vs Coinbase-to-network.  It's still a dumb solution for a problem that shouldn't exist.

Yes.  Though I'm sure you won't complain if the price goes up instead of down ;)  Either way the Coinbase transaction is set the moment you buy, nothing about the USD $$ or BTC value will change with the transaction.
*Technically*, if you go through all the Coinbase verification (&amp; link a VISA CC as a backup payment method) you can do instant BTC buys without waiting.  But you need to get set up on Coinbse &amp; do a few buys first before you get to that level.

You would be better off using some other wallet honestly.  re: "online" wallets not sure what to suggest since you're not into Blockchain.  (though Coinjar is in Austrailia, no?)  There are a few others out there but I'm not familiar with them.

Not good.. you're just going to have to see what PP decides to do.  Every once in a while PP actually lets the seller win the dispute.  But usually.. no.
Bitcoin transactions are against PP's terms so they're not really inclined to accept "proof" for a transaction they don't support.  Not to mention your PP account may get suspended/canceled due to dealing w/ bitcoin.
Good luck!  Hopefully gets resolved in your favor, just be realistic that you may have been scammed successfully on this one.

You can re-add the same QR codes from any screenshots, or printouts.  So, when you're adding new 2FA QR Codes into your 2FA app just make sure to grab a screenshot (or print it).
If you *are* saving screenshots of QR Codes, don't leave them on your own computer, or an internet connected computer.. best to keep them on a USB stick or similar.  Otherwise if your computer is compromised the hacker could potentially keylog your passwords *and* have access to your 2FA backups..which isn't good obviously ;)

Chase &amp; Capital One might be red flags, the others are usually OK if you're just using Coinbase and/or the occasional wire transfers.
It's a bit different if you're doing a lot of trades via Localbitcoins, &amp; having random people deposit into your account (especially personal checking accounts).  That's usually when people have issues w/ their bank it seems.
There's a list on [bitcointalk] ( not sure how up to date it is.
One thing I'd suggest, definitely have a separate checking account for bitcoin/website stuff.  It'll make it a lot easier in the case a bank decides they don't like transfers coming in from bitcoin-related companies, etc.

Coinbase is weird with their 2FA.  It *should* be possible to enable 2FA with just Google Authenticator, but AFAICT they always require a phone number.
Kind of a hack to get around it, but the only thing I can think of is to set up a Google Voice phone number &amp; give Coinbase *that* phone number, which'll enable 2FA &amp; then you can add GAuth as well.  Coinbase is still going to send 2FA codes to your "phone", so this may or may not be a good idea..  (at the very least, enable Google Authenticator on that Google Voice account to minimize any future hacks!)

Coinbase is the only other service in the U.S. that can do bank ACH transfers, you should check them out if you haven't already.
Outside of CampBX there are a few exchanges you can use too, but they'd require domestic or international bank wire transfers so the transfer fees will be a bit higher.  e.g.

If you can do EUR SEPA withdrawal that would be your only chance (it still takes MtGox maybe 4-6+ weeks to process the withdrawal).  No idea if that's an option in your country.
No other fiat withdrawal option is viable at MtGox.  You should just use Bitstamp, IMO.

Do you use Cryptsy?  Those are account trading keys, for receiving fund transfers within Cryptsy (from other Cryptsy users).  Each key is tied to individual Cryptsy accounts.
It means that person has account(s) on Cryptsy itself.  Cryptsy likely has their IP addresses, emails, &amp; whatnot (though I'd expect the IPs were through Tor).  I'd think Cryptsy would probably want to at least shut down fake Vern's account(s), if they aren't already shut down.

I'd guess within a few weeks if you're doing SEPA withdrawal (or withdrawing in Japan).  If you're in the U.S. you may as well cancel the $$ withdraw now, otherwise you're looking at 6+ months wait time..

Coinbase is likely the most trusted bitcoin service, or at least pretty high up there.
That said, if you're nervous you should really open a spare checking account &amp; link *that* to Coinbase (or any other website that needs access to a bank account).  That way even if your account was somehow compromised you would only lose whatever is in the spare checking account.

Wire transfer USD to a U.S. bank?  You haven't been waiting long enough, check back in maybe 6+ months.
But seriously, MtGox hasn't been processing USD withdrawals to U.S. banks for a long time now.  Your best bet (really, your only bet) is to cancel the wire, buy BTC, &amp; transfer the BTC out of MtGox.  In the U.S. Coinbase should be pretty easy to trade BTC for USD.

I guess you could email support however they are U.S. only so what you're describing isn't an "error".
Also: Coinbase does not allow purchasing through credit card, they use that as a backup payment method.  They always charge the linked bank account (U.S. checking account) for bitcoin purchases.  *Only* if the bank account transaction failed (e.g. insufficient funds) will Coinbase then charge the credit card as a backup payment method.

Not that I've heard of.


While I'm not directly involved w/ any businesses accepting bitcoin I'd think you would treat these transactions the same as cash.  Any sales tax owed to the city/state would need to be paid in USD of course.


That's a tough one.  While *usually* things would go smoothly &amp; quickly (if you're OK w/ zero conf transactions) you may have the issue where someone is using a slow-ish web wallet (e.g. Coinbase) that won't always transmit the transaction to the network in a timely manner.  Not sure what the best workaround for that situation is.
@_date: 2014-10-07 20:35:44
More info needed... are you in the U.S., &amp; is this a transfer from a U.S. bank?  An ACH transfer between U.S. banks typically takes 2-5 business days, not counting weekends/holidays.  *Maybe* panic if it's been over 5 business days, otherwise just hold tight.  You are correct, the bank will lock those funds on your end so you can't actually use that amount of $ anymore.
Technically if you're coming from Coinbase you should be used to this by now :)
Related: I don't see how much of Circle's "instant" promises are going to hold up long-term, they can't always front the $$ for things like these ACH delays.  (granted, perhaps I'm not understanding their entire setup...or they're still working out all the bugs)

No 2FA?  Ouch!  Your account was going to be hacked sooner or later :/
Does your email provider give you a list of IPs that access your email account?  e.g. GMail &amp; Yahoo do that sort of thing.  Could be worth a look just to be sure.  Though now that I think about it, maybe email isn't that relevant here.
The conspiracy theorists in will probably say that someone within BTC-E likely hacked your account.. I'm not sure if I buy that story, but BTC-E *does* have a track record of accounts w/o 2FA being hacked *and* having said account's login notification emails temporarily disabled during the hack.  Does seem a bit weird for those emails to suddenly get disabled, just to be re-enabled later..  Kind of makes you wonder.
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:41:58
Ouch.  This might be something best to ask outside though I'm not sure where would be the best place to ask something like this.
If anything, I'm surprised Capital One didn't close your account just for transacting with bitcoin.  They're infamous for closing Bitfloor's account after all.
Offhand?  Well, you can't pay back Capital One so consider all your accounts with them closed &amp; suspended.  Best to start over with a new bank account somewhere else.  Capital One might try to send you to collections I guess?  You'll definitely want to get legal advice, or maybe even try going the bankruptcy route?
BTW, is the user still in good standing in Litecoinlocal?  Unfortunately they're not going to be much use either since all your subsequent transactions were outside of them.
You could also try perhaps?  They might have better info re: the litecoinlocal angle.

That's pretty normal if you're signing up for an exchange.  If you want anonymity you'd need to at least stick to cash transactions (e.g. via Localbitcoins).
I wouldn't describe bitcoin as "anonymous", but maybe pseudonymous if used correctly.  e.g. don't link your bitcoin addresses to any paper trail, bank account, identity, trackable transactions, &amp; always create new addresses for every transaction.. it's not that easy doing all that ;)  Also consider that bitcoin's entire transaction ledger is open to the general public.

That won't really help with anything AFAIK.  When you look up an IP address for a bitcoin transaction, I think you're just seeing the country of the bitcoin node that initially broadcast the transaction.. something along those lines, someone more in the know can explain that better ;)
The email with the login IP is the closest evidence you have, unfortunately it is highly likely the person logged in using Tor, Proxy, or similar, so the IP address is very very unlikely to be his/hers.
You could try filing a police report maybe, though you'd really need to talk to whoever deals with international theft matters (aka not your local law enforcement).

Doubt it, PP would claw back the funds.  Maybe your best bet is to take out all the $$ from the linked PP bank account and/or close the bank account itself.  That way PP can't claw back the funds.  (of course, consider your PP account terminated at this point)
You might need to cancel any CC you linked to PP too.

Hard to say, you need to narrow down all your attack points.  Is it your gmail?  Or other accounts as well?  Remember this could be any email account, phone (e.g. if you're using Google Voice), your computer(s) (esp if you have remote access enabled everywhere), etc.  Also, if you ever saved website users/passwords on any web browsers (or clicked that device as "trusted" during login) all of those computer/device browsers are also attack points.
As a matter of practice, anything online bitcoin-related, &amp; yes email/phone, should always have 2FA enabled (preferably Google Authenticator, though Authy seems to be OK too).
OTOH that's *a lot* of BTC to even keep online, that sort of amount might be better for cold storage.

Sounds like you've got the right idea!
Eventually you may want to think about backing up your Authenticator QR Codes, in the case your phone is lost/stolen/dead.  Usually you can just save a screenshot of the QR Code to somewhere offline, e.g. USB stick or similar.  Or some people just print them out &amp; keep the printouts somewhere safe.  (in the case you need to re-add the codes to a new phone you can simply re-scan them from your backup QR Code pictures/printouts).

You could try contacting the [BitMinter pool] ( &amp; tell them that miner (miner user nats989_SGLwk12) is installing malware on your systems to mine to their pool.  You have their miner user/pw in the file.  There's a good chance the pool will ban that user from mining there.
That technically won't stop the culprit from trying the same thing on another pool though.
The better solution is to install something like Deep Freeze or similar &amp; constantly wipe the lab machines on a daily basis, or however schedule you like.  And/or stop giving people admin privileges to install/run things like that.. e.g. without admin privileges they could only do something like that while they're logged in.
Also: You aren't logging who is coming/going into the lab to use the machines?  I find it hard to believe it'd be *that* hard to figure out who the individual user is &amp; simply discuss this face-to-face, or ban him/her from the lab.

Yes, AFAIK deposits are still possible.  Keep in mind you need to be verified, &amp; it might take some time for them to credit your deposit, but should be possible otherwise..


We can't predict the price there by the time your deposit is credited at MtGox.

I'd also go with Ripple.  They have a ton of funding already, &amp; if they manage to get more gateways it'll be even easier to get fiat into the Ripple network.  That alone solves the problem that most bitcoin exchanges have with receiving fiat deposits.
OTOH Ripple can also be complementary to bitcoin so it's hard to say if they're direct competition, e.g. it's already pretty cheap to use Ripple for sending USD into Bitstamp (vs expensive international wire transfers).  Or just to trade for BTC within Ripple itself.
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:06:59
What country are you in?  Unless your bank is in Japan or in one of the EUR SEPA countries it wouldn't be possible to get a funds withdrawal, even with verification.
However, if you verify then you can at least withdraw bitcoin when/if they ever resume bitcoin withdrawals.
Not sure *how* you're going to be able to verify though.  Perhaps temporarily have some of the bills at your residence changed to your name?  You're also going to need government ID (e.g. in the U.S. that would be driver's license or similar).  Or.. I guess you could fake it, not sure how often that works though.
Either way the verification process is going to take over a month or more, so don't expect it to happen too quickly.

I think you're misunderstanding, 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) generally requires that you have an app on your smartphone.  It has nothing to do with installing things on a computer.  Are you not allowed to install apps on your phone?
e.g. I have Kraken too, &amp; have 2FA enabled with Google Authenticator.  The GA app itself is installed on my Android phone, but is linked to the Kraken account by taking a picture of the QR Code that the Kraken website displays when setting up 2FA.
You should really set up 2FA on all bitcoin-related sites &amp; your email if possible (this is easy with GMail).  Remember that hackers will try to get into both those types of accounts.
Aside from Google Authenticator some sites can also use Authy (another 2FA app) or do 2FA via SMS text, or sometimes via email.  The email one is the least secure IMO b/c that definitely means you need to lock down your email account..

I personally haven't had problems with them (if anything, their USPS deposit times seems to be a bit faster nowadays).  But I get that some people definitely have had issues with them.  I'd strongly suggest taking a picture of the USPS money order &amp; receipt *before* mailing them anything (&amp; keep things legible, of course).  And don't try to deposit more $$ than your account limits allow, that's just asking for problems galore.  Just my 2 cents.

You have a few options if you're in the U.S.  Coinbase is easiest if you just want to do an easy buy &amp; occasional selling of bitcoin (they'd link up to your U.S. checking account).

Offhand, I'd suggest checking out Bitstamp.  You'd need to send the deposit in EUR (or maybe USD), they'll basically convert the EUR to USD for USD trading there.  Kraken would also be good to check out.
You should definitely avoid MtGox at any rate.

I'm not aware of the banking specifics in Japan, but presumably if they can do international wires like everyone else then they should still be able to trade at Bitstamp or other exchanges.  (or local broker services like Localbitcoins, etc.)
It's unlikely MtGox is the only exchange people in Japan can use.. that's like saying users in the U.S. are unable to use Bitstamp, VoS, etc. ;)

Well, OP was comparing to MtGox.  The U.S. based exchanges most certainly are viable alternatives to MtGox ;)  I've been using Coinmkt &amp; CampBX myself.  (also use Kraken, but of course they don't do USD trading in most U.S. states yet)
re: Bitstamp, yeah I'd definitely agree they're the main exchange w/ the most volume at the moment.  But they already were even when MtGox was up, so even Bitstamp was more viable vs MtGox!

On the U.S. / Coinbase side you'd be looking at 1% fee + $.15 bank ACH fee.  You'd want need to do the math (obvs) but it sounds like it'd still end up cheaper than the wire transfer.

I don't know if that's necessarily true.  WF seems to have at least a few cryptocurrency clients, e.g. SnapSwap, Litetree also seem to have accounts at WF.
Doesn't necessarily mean WF is bitcoin *friendly*, but they seem to be tolerant for the time being.  Otherwise we would have seen WF shut down those company accounts Chase-style by now.

You should probably open a support ticket with them.  AFAICT they do seem to respond to support tickets &amp; fix things.
I had the opposite issue, completed an order just before they disabled escrow.  They went ahead &amp; manually released the escrow to the seller without my consent, which I guess is what they are doing sitewide "manually".  Problem was that I hadn't received what I ordered yet, &amp; the seller wasn't answering my messages!  But I opened a support ticket &amp; Cryptothrift transferred the BTC back into my escrow so I could request a escrow refund, so it all worked out.

Ouch!  I'm in NYC too, though admittedly haven't made it out to any of these meetups.
Your encounter is a bit surprising, there's plenty of women in finance (this is NYC, after all) so it's not a stretch that there would be women interested in bitcoin.  And some may even come out to those meetups.  Your experience is definitely cringe-worthy, hopefully that sort of thing doesn't happen often at these things.  I can only say that not all us NYC bitcoiners are like that :)

Are you sure your systems just aren't compromised by a hacker?  I only ask b/c nats989 seems to be someone that has been mining bitcoin, at the bitminter pool, since at least [November 2012] (  Whoever it is, it's someone that's been into bitcoin for a long time.  There's a chance this person has a fair amount of bitcoin &amp; may even be a bit well off if they've cashed any of it out.  It *could* be a student.  But more likely someone that works in the labs, faculty, or just a hacker with easy access to the school's poorly protected network.
You're a CS prof so I'm sure you can get creative with some more tech ways to stop this.  e.g. start logging when the systems get this software executable, null route or firewall connections to bitminer.com and/or port 8332, actually install some real anti-virus that'd flag all instances of minderd.exe, cgminer.exe &amp; bfgminer.exe (most AV programs do this already!), things like that.
But if it's any consolation, this is someone who's been mining on the same account at bitminter since November 2012 so they'd be pretty sad if you manage to ban them from there ;)

I dunno, stick with Coinbase if you need cheap + ACH?
If you need to buy from somewhere cheaper than Coinbase then you should use one of the exchanges (of course none of the exchanges do bank ACH transfers AFAIK).
Hmm... looking into it further, BitSimple does seem to have an ACH option for withdrawals, if it matters
..though they don't seem to have the option for buying.

Yeah... I'd avoid MtGox personally.  Then again I'm in the U.S. so I'm biased ;)

@_date: 2014-02-20 00:04:00
Yup, that thought did occur to me.  But you'd need to make sure the payments are being matched up with particular invoice/receipt  that angle is more complicated than just randomly sending BTC/$$ to some person/address.  From what I gather even the Venmo app isn't doing payment invoicing/tracking like that.
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:09:16
In case you're looking for an actual answer:
Not sure what country you're in, but generally you're looking at doing an international bank wire transfer into MtGox (unless you're in Japan, or maybe one of the EUR SEPA countries).  I wouldn't describe it as "fast", but it's the only way to get fiat into there.
That said, I'm pretty sure you need to be verified first before doing bank transfers.  That process alone takes at least a month, so you better get started if you aren't verified there already!
@_date: 2014-10-01 22:39:09
Ouch!  In theory, support could verify your ownership if you're able to show proof that you own the bitcoin addresses that the wallet transacted with, or some other proof of transaction times/amounts, or maybe IP addresses that accessed the site.  Dunno how their support would handle such a request.

If you have friends willing to trade PP for BTC that may be your best bet, honestly.  Any sort of BTC transaction is against PP's TOS so technically both seller/buyer are risking their PP account for these types of transactions.
But I suppose a friend may be willing to take the risk for you?  Only other thing I can think of is to find a random person willing to do this on the regular for you (for a high fee) but that won't be easy.

Judging from the comments in that article it seems you're not the only one mislead by it.
re: the codes you lost, you have to contact BTC-E, Havelock, etc. &amp; attempt to do a 2FA reset.
In the future, you can back up your GAuth codes using either:
a. Rooted Android phone + Titanium Backup (make sure you're encrypting those backup files)
b. Take a screenshot, or print the picture, of any authenticator codes you're setting up.  Store the screenshots offline somewhere (e.g. USB stick or similar).  To re-add onto a new phone you'd simply open up each screenshot &amp; re-scan the code back into GAuth..

What country are you trying to withdraw to?  MtGox only processes fiat withdrawals to banks in Japan (JPY) &amp; some SEPA transfers (EUR).
Nothing else can be withdrawn from there (especially to U.S. banks).  They'll tell you it's processing, but you're literally going to be waiting 6+ months easily.

Hopefully you're not in the U.S., you would have never been able to withdraw $$ to a U.S. bank anyway.
What's annoying is they are perfectly happy to let users send BTC *into* MtGox without verification.  Kinda wonder if this is MtGox's way of getting free BTC loans from users, there's always a lot of conspiracy talk about whether MtGox is even solvent nowadays.

Wallet passphrase doesn't matter, no way you'll ever recover an old wallet.dat file from a DBAN'd HD.  So the wallet.dat's passphrase is useless at this point.  Think of it as a passworded zip file, the password doesn't help you if you no longer have the zip file.
However, the bitcoin addresses/private key pairs are in the blockchain.  If you still have the private keys for each of your bitcoin addresses then you have a shot at recovering the balances in each bitcoin address.  It doesn't sound like you do, but yeah.. that'd be your only shot.

At first I thought maybe this happened b/c you accessed your bitcoins/MtGox account while in China (remember that business travelers never travel to China with their regular laptops/phones, &amp; immediately wipe those devices on return to the U.S.. for good reason!).  But then again MtGox accounts tend to be hacked quickly when they don't have 2FA enabled so maybe your travel to China is just a red herring in all this.

No one reputable really deals with Paypal/BTC transactions due to fraud/chargebacks.
I've read some people like to use VirWoX, where they do Paypal -&gt; SLL -&gt; BTC.  There's a lot of fees involved so I wouldn't recommend, but it's an option if you really want to go that route.  (may want to Google around for specifics)
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:25:14
It's a CC, isn't it?  Wouldn't you just do a chargeback and/or get a new CC number?
Unless it's a particularly huge theft, or part of a theft of thousands+ CC numbers, it's unlikely the CC company is going to spend much time trying to figure out who stole your number.
re: bitcoin, it's not exactly anonymous.  In theory you could get law enforcement to subpoena records from Coin.mx such as IP address &amp; whatnot, but most likely the thief wasn't even using their own IP address/email/etc. so it's probably not much use.  The bitcoin itself was probably already transferred out of there &amp; is long gone.

Too many loan defaulters, best to avoid btcjam IMO.
You should diversify, the problem is usually one defaulter will significantly lower the total earnings you would have made (or maybe just put you in the red).  Even worse, nothing can be done about the defaulters.  BTCJam claims to send those loans to arbitration (net-arb) but that company is pretty shady itself &amp; doesn't have any legal backing to really do anything about a loan default.  I'm sure BTCJam is very aware of those issues but won't do anything, so the whole site is kind of a scammer's paradise.

Country?  If you're based in the U.S. it'll be a long time before you get your USD withdrawal.  People have said 6 months at least, though I've read of people waiting longer than that.  MtGox just isn't that usable if you need to withdraw USD to a U.S. bank account.
On the other hand if you're outside the U.S. then your withdrawal delay is weird, MtGox users outside the U.S. apparently haven't been getting these massive delays (from what I've read).

Not normally.  People will just send you bitcoin &amp; you won't know where it came from.  With some custom work you could in theory script something so you can record the information of people making donations (e.g. similar to what the [EFF] ( does).

PSA for what?  Your post title is very confusing.  Maybe a PSA for everyone to enable 2FA on their accounts? :)
Either way it is clear both your Coinbase &amp; Cryptsy accounts are compromised.  Probably your email too.  Hard to say how/why, but at a minimum you should be checking your computer, &amp; any other computer/phone/device that you access those websites with, for viruses, malware, etc.
Did you have 2FA enabled on your Coinbase, Cryptsy &amp; email accounts?  If not, enable them immediately.  Also change all your passwords to unique strong passwords.

In Kraken if you're enabled for fiat funding then you should be able to see your account limit by clicking funding, then clicking your fiat.  In the right-hand side there should be a blue box w/ your deposit limits.  You can also see account limits under the "Get Verified' section, e.g. this one is mine: 
(of course, Kraken doesn't do USD deposits/withdrawals so I can't say how accurate those limits are atm...  someone with EUR set up can chime in here re: EUR limits).
Not sure on Bitstamp, though I think(?) the limits would be posted in the screen where you set up fiat deposits/withdrawals.

I guess Ebay?  You're liable to get scammed, plus Ebay &amp; Paypal may suspend/close your accounts b/c the accounts were used for bitcoin (cryptocurrency is against both site's policies).  But if you're willing to take on those risks then maybe it's an option.
Otherwise if you'd rather play it safe you should really avoid Paypal when it comes to bitcoin.

I know what you're getting at, but is right, there are a few places that have been accepting CC for a while

Not sure why CoinDrip would be all that different.
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think the general idea with those sites is to get a lot of verification info on the customers + add a huge upcharge on the BTC price.  In that sense even if the sites get scammed once in a while they would have charged enough on the legit transactions to at least break even, if not profit.
Using CC to buy BTC is still a stupid idea, but it could be workable if you set up the system correctly.

Bitcoin (&amp; all cryptocurrency) transactions are against Paypal's TOS.

The litecoin video's color scheme is a bit weird in the beginning, to me it looks like blood droplets (though maybe it's a blood drive telethon in which case it's perfect!).

Kraken is great, but they don't do USD trading in all 50 states yet.  (unfortunately I'm in one of those states)  They're pretty popular already with the EUR SEPA crowd.
They're also set up w/ Ripple which will be useful (I already use Ripple to deposit USD into Bitstamp).
Once they have wider availability in all 50 states they'll likely be one of the bigger exchanges easily.  Right now the volume isn't quite that high.

Well, if you go by the article a possible replacement would be an RFID card (e.g. "tap" instead of swipe).  MTA already has RFID deployed on some turnstiles in Manhattan, I think it's their test run for the moment.
You'd still need to load the card with funds, which can be done with bitcoin if the MTA ever went that route.
Bitcoin itself as the method to get into the turnstiles would be too slow.  Even the current card swipe solution is too slow.  Although.. you can't rule out an MTA app that enables RFID from someone's phone, that would allow funding your "account" which could be on the app or a RFID card.

You can't enter a debit card number into Coinbase.  e.g. [Square Cash] ( performs transactions using a debit card, that's not something Coinbase does.
Coinbase *does* do ACH transfers to/from U.S. checking accounts using bank account + routing number.  It's not quite what OP was asking for, unless OP got confused maybe.

Incorrect, MtGox's policy changed sometime in the past 6 months or so.  Basically all new users need to be verified to withdraw fiat *or* BTC.
The change also affected a lot of users before the change, though some users weren't affected by that change (I'm not sure how/why, if you weren't affected consider yourself lucky!).
Just do a search on plenty of users have run into this issue already.

Not sure if you would sell that amount on an exchange TBH.  You'd be better off trying to find someone looking to purchase a large quantity, decide on a price, &amp; then do the trade.  I think(?) that's how the whales do it without affecting market price.
The other option is to sell it in chunks on exchanges &amp; slowly add it to your bank account, though that would take a while.
There'll be tax implications either way, but if you're talking 1000 bitcoin then you already know that ;)

In theory they probably wouldn't need it if the bitcoin ATM vendor already collected all the ID info to set up an "account" for you to use that ATM.  Like, *cough*, a bank.
Since the bitcoin ATMs at the moment are not linked to personal accounts AFAIK then the next best thing is to ask for the ID when you're using it.
It's not really that they want to do it, but otherwise government gets to swoop in &amp; confiscate all their assets.  It happened before with MtGox already, no reason to assume it wouldn't happen again.

That's kind of a stretch..  Neither that thread, nor the Google suggestions page, is confirmation that Google is working on anything bitcoin.

I can't comment on the android apps, but data inside any encrypted connections won't be monitored by your ISP.  A standard HTTPS connection would be enough for that, e.g. 
That said, I seriously doubt your ISP cares about how much bitcoin you have.  They're more interested in you being able to pay your bill (in USD, or whatever currency your country uses).

Only spend what you can afford to lose, you never know if the price is going to go up or down in a year, or 10.


You should prob avoid mining.  Bitcoin mining has moved on way past CPU &amp; GPU mining so it's kind of pointless.  Not to mention nvidia GPUs have always been terrible for mining coins.  (if you *really* want, get an AMD GPU &amp; mine one of the altcoins instead e.g. Litecoin, check out if you want to go that route).

Withdrawing $$ to a U.S. bank account?  It'd take at least 6 months or more to process.  Better to cancel the withdraw, buy bitcoin, &amp; transfer the bitcoin out of MtGox.

I admit a bit heavy handed (Citi could have just said "Hey, you've exceeded your transfers for the month on your savings account!").  But don't banks tell you this when you sign up for a savings account?  That regulation has been around pretty much forever.
It's also why it's a very bad idea to link things like Coinbase to a savings account.  You've got to stick to checking accounts if you're going to be doing many transfers.

There are no legit exchanges that accept CC deposits AFAIK.  Remember that CC transactions are reversible so no one really wants to touch CCs when it comes to buying/selling BTC.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but running a node does not imply that your transactions get transmitted or confirmed any faster AFAIK.  Someone else in asked the same thing a while back re: brick and mortar store.
re: my post, it wasn't so much regarding getting transactions from the POS to the network faster, it was more in regards to customers paying with bitcoin from web wallets that are slow to send transactions to the network.  For example [this guy] (wanted to pay out of his Coinbase wallet, however Coinbase can be ridiculously slow with sending out BTC sometimes.  It's not a big deal when you're doing a random online purchase, but if you're doing a in-person POS/restaurant/bar situation &amp; the BTC didn't come in within the first minute then it becomes a huge hassle.
In that sense Coinbase is great for their services but they're a pretty crappy web wallet unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:34:41
Wow, yeah that's a weird one.  Wonder how they connected your email account to BTC-E.  Maybe your email was part of the bitcointalk hack a while back?  They must have known your email was connected to bitcoin somehow.
For what it's worth, I think (?) when Google says "passed a sign in challenge" that means the hacker got a security question during the login attempt &amp; typed in the correct answer.  Like, if you ever try to access your GMail from overseas or through TOR Google will throw up security questions, etc. in the case it's a hacker/something.
I can't tell really if maybe you set your security answers too easy, or the attacker somehow had all this info.  In the meantime, I strongly suggest adding 2FA onto your Google &amp; BTC-E accounts &amp; reviewing what security questions/answers you have on there.  (2FA in the form of Google Authenticator or Authy, preferably).
In the end though, maybe the attacker just happened to get lucky in that both the GMail &amp; BTC-E accounts did not have 2FA?  None of that is really going to help you w/ your lost coins though :/
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:52:24
Your best bet is to ask this question in the forum you copied that bitcoin address from.  The owner of that address is a member of that forum, right?
You're really relying on this person to send the BTC back to you, there's no other way to do it, so it's imperative that you at least get their attention by posting in whatever forum he/she hangs out in.

CryptoThrift works fairly well IMO, &amp; might(?) be the biggest site for this purpose now that BitMit is gone.  There are certainly things they could do *better* (e.g. their system does not handle automatic releasing of sold codes/keys, BitMit was so much better at that).
However, you may want to hold off until they resolve their escrow issues (escrow is currently disabled there).  Selling stuff for bitcoin without some sort of escrow system in place is kind of useless unless both parties enjoy taking risks.

I don't think they're bad necessarily, some of them can be interesting experiments that may apply to bitcoin eventually.  e.g. that Premine (PMC) coin may end up being an example of how bitcoin will function once all the blocks are mined (&amp; miners only mine for transaction fees).

Yeah, I may have to test the theory myself sometime.  I *can* confirm that copying the browser data typically keeps any save website user/password data intact.
Being a computer tech this is something I do when setting up a new computer for someone (you'd be surprised how many people have no idea what their old website user/passwords are if you accidentally delete their browser data!).  I've always assumed any saved 2FA information would work the same way, since it's just being saved locally as part of the browser data that can be migrated to another computer if desired.
To be clear: Coinbase should *not* be allowing users to save 2FA codes on any web browsers, IMO.  I'm only describing current behavior :/

I'd go with Bitstamp based on trade volume / legit.  Their trade volume is huge &amp; they're not pulling any scams like MtGox (who, for the record, you should avoid!).
You could also check out Kraken, Vault of Satoshi, Coinmkt, they're all pretty legit IMO.  (Kraken can't trade USD in all 50 U.S. states, if you're in the U.S. you'd want to check that out first)

Coinbase isn't an exchange.  For USD trading try

Bistamp has the most trade volume, technically if you want to do this a lot you may as well get set up there.

This is a bit confusing, though it sounds like that 1 day span that there was no 2FA enabled was enough for someone to jump into your account :(
Unfortunately BTC-E has a reputation for people's accounts being accessed when they don't have 2FA enabled, so your account being cleaned out isn't that surprising.
What *is* a bit weird is that the 2FA was reset without your asking them to?  Or maybe that's BTC-E's policy, to reset 2FA when someone accidentally locks themselves out of their account?  Thing is, even then there was something wrong right?  It's almost like someone had already changed the pw on you in the beginning of all this.
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:10:39


Not yet AFAIK.  IRS would certainly go after you if you owe any significant amount *irregardless of bitcoin*.  I have a few friends who've been audited, trust me you don't want to go through that if you can avoid it ;)


I would report.. this is my first tax year with BTC though, so I can't comment on how exactly to report.  Most people say BTC will be considered capital gains, but until the IRS issues some more guidance on the subject it's a bit hit or miss.

re: Coinbase, they're not exactly an exchange but it *is* very easy to buy BTC through there if you're in the U.S. so it's definitely worth getting yourself set up there.  BitSimple is another service a bit similar to Coinbase but not available in all U.S. states yet.

@_date: 2014-04-09 21:35:49
Not sure if this answers your question: CampBX &amp; Coinmkt both accept deposits via USPS money order.  Useful if you're in the U.S., though maybe not so useful if you're international.
You could also do a cash deposit if you're buying through Localbitcoins or bitquick.co.  Or if you're adventurous you could also buy BTC through Ripple (you'd also do a cash deposit into a bank to start off).
@_date: 2014-03-30 04:19:46
Hopefully it's just maintenance like they say.  I last used them a month ago &amp; had no issues withdrawing BTC.
That said, I don't have any BTC or USD there anymore.  Their lack of a bank (no wire transfers, ACH transfers, etc.) make me a bit nervous.  Trade volume there crashed after their bank issues, it's not even cheaper to buy there vs other exchanges, or Coinbase, nowadays.
Never had any real problems with them but would rather sit this one out in case anything happens with the exchange.
@_date: 2014-01-26 05:56:29
Yup.  Essentially CB is trusting that your bank account will be good for the BTC purchase, but if the bank's ACH transfer fails then CB is going to hit your CC as the backup payment method.

Through Ripple?  Nah, it's much easier to sell BTC through Coinbase &amp; get the USD into my bank account that way ;)
However.. I think by emailing SnapSwap (the gateway I'm on) I could get my bank account linked up to them, after which I should be able to withdraw USD.  I've haven't tried to do that yet so not quite sure how feasible it is.
Maybe someone else in has done this &amp; can comment on the process..
For what it's worth, for depositing USD I always deposit cash into SnapSwap's Wells Fargo checking account.  It appears as USD in my Ripple wallet in 1-2 business days.

There's a few places you can check out

For the actual bank deposit, fill out a deposit slip w/ the seller's account # &amp; exact amount you're depositing.  Take a picture of the deposit slip, in case you need it later.  Make sure you have the exact amount, in cash.  When you're at the teller just tell them you're making a deposit &amp; give them the deposit slip &amp; cash, that's pretty much it.
Once the deposit is made, once the deposit is verified by the seller they'll send you the agreed amount of bitcoin.

Or JPY transfer if you're in Japan, maybe SEPA EUR transfer if you're in a EUR SEPA country.
My hunch is that the BTC price will be much different by the time you manage to get any funds into MtGox.

OP never mentioned anything about having multiple bank accounts in multiple countries.  Normally you have a U.S. bank account, or you don't.
But yes, if say you have access to bank accounts in Japan &amp; in the U.S. then trade away.  Feel free to start your own thread on the topic if you like.

Unlikely, once the coins are transferred out they're gone.  Sorry about that :/
You definitely need to enable 2FA when dealing with bitcoin sites (preferably with Google Authenticator or Authy).  And even then, keep in mind that your email is also another attack vector, so you'll want to have 2FA for your email too (easy with Gmail) or at the very least a strong password.

Nope, Coinbase is not an exchange.
Never say never.. but I doubt the same would happen at Coinbase.  They have a lot of venture funding behind them, seems unlikely the VCs would allow their investment to tank like that.  Not to mention being in the U.S. they'd attract a lot of lawsuits if they pulled anything close to what MtGox did.

Log into BTC-E, click Profile, click Security.  There you'll see your options for enabling Two-Factor Authentication.  (You may want to install Google Authenticator on your phone first, if you plan to enable it)

Depends a bit on your withdraw method &amp; country.  If you are withdrawing JPY to a Japanese bank account, or you're doing EUR SEPA withdraw (to a country in the Euro zone), then you can expect maybe about 4+ weeks for the withdraw.
Any other withdraw method (international wire) means you are not getting the fiat withdraw.  Especially if you are attempting to withdraw to a U.S. bank account.  In these cases the only way to get anything out of MtGox is to cancel the wire transfer request, go through verification if you haven't already, &amp; then buy &amp; withdraw the bitcoin from there.  It's the only way.
@_date: 2014-01-26 16:41:43
Reading the bitcointalk threads it seems that SEPA &amp; JPY withdrawals are delayed, but delayed like 4+ weeks, so they're not quite impossible but definitely not fast either.  International wires on the other hand...

Won't help much now, but with BTC-E &amp; other bitcoin sites you really need to enable two factor authentication (via Google Authenticator or Authy, preferably).  And also secure your email, preferably with its own unique password &amp; two factor authentication.  Otherwise accounts on sites like BTC-E tend to be hacked quickly unfortunately.
re: your theft, there's little that can be done now.  Once the bitcoin is transferred out it's gone.  You did mention they cashed out via BTC-E code?  Not sure how likely it is, but if the code hasn't been cashed out yet maybe BTC-E can void the code &amp; credit you the USD.  Or at the very least they'll see another account on BTC-E that ended up using the BTC-E code, maybe they can deduct the funds from there.. who knows. (though it's likely the code itself was sold to someone else)  Not sure what their procedure is for that.

It's not a *huge* deal to me since I generally mail in money orders, &amp; later cash out through Coinbase, but they're not anywhere near a serious competitor if users can't even do a basic bank wire or ACH to/from them.
(even worse, they charge $20 for mailing out a money order.. at least Vault of Satoshi does that for free!)

A lot of us are in the same boat so you're not alone :)  It's worrying enough that I'm not sure if it's a good idea to actually submit SSN as part of verification for other exchanges.  e.g. Coinsetter asks for SSN, &amp; even though they seem legit I'm here wondering what happens if they get shut down or something.  It's still the early days with bitcoin, that's for sure.
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:52:04
My last few USPS money order deposits took about 7-10 days.  Presumably with a check they'll have to wait for the check to clear (another 2-5 business days), so I'm guessing you're looking at closer to 14 days maybe.

No.  CB is U.S. only at the moment.


I doubt it?  The only time they were selling bitcoin was through a 3rd party service (through SMS) so it was more of a service referral at the time.  They've never been in the business of buying/selling directly.
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:18:34
Yes, but you need to verify yourself at MtGox first before withdrawing bitcoin.  That alone may take a few months.. not sure why you'd really want to go through all that.
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:51:51
I dunno, it's been a while since anyone in has recommended MtGox.  In fact, it's *not* recommended to use MtGox if you're in the U.S. since you effectively can't get any USD out of there into a U.S. bank anyway.
But to answer your question, when I verified back in like June it only took about a week.  Nowadays people seem to be waiting a month or more to get verified (judging from all the posts in about this subject)

Hmm.. well, they're $5 million in the hole due to USD seizures, with the possibility of further fines/seizures.  So I guess they'd want want to sell for at least $10-$20 million?
It's likely cheaper to build out a new exchange &amp; get all the proper MSB licensing etc, &amp; start off with a clean slate.
I suppose if you think the MtGox domain name, &amp; Midas, are worth that much?  And/or inheriting a userbase that wants to jump ship ASAP?  Not sure if any of that is really *that* valuable, but maybe..?

Ah, well at least *someone* is remembering to enable 2FA ;)
But seriously, you're going to have to work with Bitstamp support on this.  Presumably you already verified with them right?  I imagine they can unlock your account once they verify you are who you are.  Downside is 2FA resets on most exchanges usually take a few weeks to a month.  (not sure on Bitstamp's specific policy)
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:13:23


Do what everyone else does, email support ask them to review your transaction &amp; if possible to re-instate it at the original sale price.  You can also ask them to "whitelist" your account for future transactions.  Just don't expect a reply instantly, it takes them a while to get back to you unfortunately.  (my last email took 10 days for a response, but I haven't had problems since then)

Did you search ?  If you're attempting USD withdrawal to a U.S. bank, this is not possible.  People say to wait 6+ months, but even then it's not a given that you'd get a withdrawal.
Your best (really, your only) bet is to buy bitcoin &amp; transfer that out of MtGox.  But only if you're verified.  If you're not verified you better get started, that alone will take a month or more.

You should give it a shot &amp; see how it works out.  In the U.S. Coinbase will be the easiest to link a U.S. checking account to (&amp; likely also the cheapest), your BoA account should be usable for this.
The U.S. part is easy, the more tricky part is how you're going to buy the bitcoin in Sweden.  You should figure out how easy/doable that will be.. technically Bistamp should be easy to use for you, but then you may have to wire/SEPA the funds which may involve bank fees(?), thus defeating the purpose of this..
The only other hurdles are whether the bitcoin price goes up/down during your transfer (which, technically if the price went down &amp; you're not in a rush you can simply wait until the price goes back up before cashing out through Coinbase).  And whether BoA suddenly doesn't like seeing Coinbase deposits, that *could* happen but I doubt you'd encounter that problem (though I imagine they may question it if the deposits are much larger than what the account normally gets).
@_date: 2014-01-23 04:40:06
Cash deposit buys are generally faster (unless you do qualify for Coinbase's instant buy).
Besides Localbitcoins you could also check out bitquick.co.  And maybe cashintocoins (though I'm not sure how fast they are).

Coinbase &amp; CampBX are the only ones that can do ACH transfers into a U.S. bank account AFAIK.
Coinmkt is another alternative, they won't do ACH but they do domestic U.S. bank wires which *should* be cheaper than international wires.  Kraken also does domestic wire transfers, but they may not be available for USD in your state (they're not operating w/ USD in all 50 states AFAIK).

Can I ask how?  I've never seen a way to disable phone 2FA on a Coinbase account, even with Google Authenticator enabled.  Outside of just outright deleting the phone number from the Coinbase account..


AFAIK you can't read SMS messages for T-Mobile phones online.  That was the whole reason I set up GV initially ;)  Not to discount your concern, since I too have GV enabled on Coinbase (though after your post maybe I shouldn't...).

Out of those four I'd say Coinmkt &amp; Kraken are the most "legit".  Hell, Kraken can't even trade USD in all 50 states yet b/c they're trying to get all the proper licensing, etc.
None of the U.S. exchanges have a huge amount of volume but maybe if/when MtGox goes away they'll have their own uptick in users.

Did your friend recommend MtGox in November?  Not the best advice!
You can't do anything about this right now, no one can withdraw BTC from MtGox.
In the meantime, is your MtGox account verified?  You need to be verified in order to withdraw BTC from there, &amp; that process takes over a month, so if you're not verified yet you should get started on it.
Not sure on your country, but you *might* be able to withdraw fiat if your bank is in Japan or one of the EUR SEPA countries, otherwise that's not an option either.
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:52:53

The thing about Coinbase, when it works it works very well.  But when there are issues they tend to fail pretty hard.
They also kind of suck as a wallet.. while it's very usable, their system sometimes slows down &amp; you'll be stuck waiting an hour or more for your BTC transfer to go out to another non-Coinbase bitcoin address.
All that said, I only had problems when first starting out with Coinbase (the dreaded order cancellation due to "high risk"), but after getting that sorted out it's been smooth sailing.  Their setup does make it way easier to buy/sell small amounts of bitcoin vs the competition.

Presumably you already emailed Coinbase?  Usually they can push your order through at the order's original sale price and/or whitelist your account to avoid being flagged high risk.
Outside of that, not sure if there are any other bitcoin services that can do ACH bank transfers like Coinbase.  BitSimple is the most similar to Coinbase but they're not available in all U.S. states yet.
Regardless, there are a few options if you're in the U.S. that you could look into if you wanted.

On a rooted Android device you can backup with Titanium Backup (make sure you encrypt the backups!), though you may want to figure out a system for where to store those backups (obvs if the phone is gone you don't want your backups gone too).
The other easy way to do it is to just grab a screenshot of the QR Code authenticator &amp; save it *offline*, say a USB stick.  Then if something happens to your phone you can simply re-add all those codes back onto your new google Authenticator on your new phone.
Authy solves this somewhat by taking care of the backups &amp; syncing to new devices for you, but you have to trust Authy with all your codes &amp; hope they don't get DDOSed off the net.  Not to mention trust Authy's support works well enough that they'll believe you when you need to change to a new phone (I've read they don't always transfer your codes to a new phone, thus defeating the purpose entirely).

The reversal itself is something you should discuss with your bank. (if you did indeed have the funds available)
Otherwise, pretty sure you're out of luck.  You could technically email Coinbase if you want, but they're not obligated to honor a purchase price for an order you were unable to pay for.  (admittingly, your bank kind of screwed you on this one)

At that point you'd no longer have any sort of PP account going forward..  Kind of drastic, but it depends on how much $$ we're talking about.

Do you have an example of any "payment partners" that allow USD from the U.S. to be deposited, &amp; then transferred to OKPay?  Presumably you've done this before..?

You may as well consider the previous SEPA request canceled.  If you never received it earlier that means it was just in the queue, never actually executed.
Of course now that the company declared bankruptcy it's safe to say that nothing is being processed as far as SEPA/wire transfers.

The BTC-E hacks were usually people who were using 2FA to their email account.  With a compromised email account it's pretty easy to get a pw reset as well as receive the 2FA code that way.

?  Not sure how you got those figures.  As far as fees they're pretty reasonable.  e.g. CampBX's fees are lower than Coinbase's actually (.55% vs 1%)
e.g. Your example, a $500 trade would have a $2.75 commission, so you'd end up with $497.25.

Oh, I meant setting up GAuth through the [website] (  You're quite right, you won't be able to use the app.
Basically with the above hack-around, you'd link the GV "phone" &amp; your installed GAuth app to Coinbase.  When you attempt to log into Coinbase it'll ask for a code, &amp; you'll have two codes available: the SMS Coinbase sends to your GV, &amp; your GAuth code.  You can enter either code to 2FA into Coinbase, though in your case you'll really just be using the GAuth code to get in.
Downside: On every login attempt there'll be a SMS sent to your GV phone with its own Coinbase code, eventually they'll  just kind of pile up in your Inbox there.  You may want to clear them out.  And/or forward the GV texts to an email address if you wanted (you can do stuff like that with GV phone numbers, it's awesome).

Sounds like you're in the U.S., so you can rule out ever getting $$ from MtGox to a U.S. bank account (even with verification).
Right now MtGox isn't even processing bitcoin withdrawals either, but hopefully that gets fixed eventually.  You're going to need to figure out how to get those verification documents, if they deny your verification request then you just won't be able to get BTC out of there.
You'll technically have those documents eventually, as you get older.. I dunno if that means your BTC will be stuck there long-term though. :/
For what it's worth there's plenty of other places you can buy/sell BTC from the U.S., MtGox just isn't one of them.

I'm not sure that "They comply with AML/KYC laws" is compatible with "You can use the exchange without verification, you just have limitations on what you can do", in that respect they're just barely complying with AML/KYC.  There's a reason they're trying so hard to stay under the radar ;)
Though I haven't had issues with them personally I'd recommend *avoiding* them for the time being.  At least until they figure out their bank issues, otherwise too risky on how easily you can get USD out of there.

If that's the case then you don't really need Coinbase.  Not sure on your specific setup, but you could always use a bitcoin app on a phone to generate bitcoin address(s) &amp; receive coins (e.g. [Mycelium] ( etc.).

re: Dwolla, they don't want to be associated with cryptocurrency (e.g. bitcoin), so last year they cut off all ties to any &amp; all cryptocurrency exchanges/services such as MtGox, CampBX, SnapSwap, etc.  In fact they changed their terms of use so if they catch any users using Dwolla for crypto transactions they'll likely suspend the associated accounts.  PayPal has similar policies in place (in case you're curious).
It was around this time that Dwolla added their little blurb at the bottom of their homepage: *Financial institutions play an important role in the Dwolla network.  Dwolla, Inc. is an agent of Veridian Credit Union and all funds associated with your account in the Dwolla network are held in a pooled account at Veridian Credit Union.*  IMO Veridian must have pressured Dwolla into dropping crypto support, but honestly I don't know enough of the backstory there.

Just about everything is different between the two.
 * Kraken is an exchange, Coinbase is not.
 * Coinbase is U.S. only, Kraken is not. (although Kraken currently is not very usable in the U.S.)
 * Coinbase deposits/withdraws from your bank account via ACH transfers, Kraken does USD transfers via bank wire transfers as well as EUR SEPA.
 * Kraken has EUR support, Coinbase does not. (thus Kraken is popular with the EUR SEPA crowd).
 * Kraken supports some altcoin trading, including Ripple.  Coinbase only supports selling/buying BTC for USD.
They *are* both technically located in the U.S. though.
Not sure if you were thinking about something specific to compare between the two.

MtGox withdraws to the U.S. are slower than anything else, people in general say to expect 6+ months before the withdraw ever clears.  So I guess you have another 4+ months, roughly.
According to other threads I've read canceling a wire transfer is pretty quick, definitely not 6+ months, maybe like a week.  Not sure how slow *that* is nowadays though.

Technically if he saved the user/password and/or 2FA code on any web browsers, &amp; then that browser's computer was compromised, any attacker could have easily copied the browser session/cookies &amp; automatically had the 2FA on any other machine (thus a different IP address).  At least I believe that should be possible (saving 2FA really means you're saving into local browser data, probably in the cookie), though someone can correct me if I'm wrong.
Outside of that, it *would* be strange that it's a different IP.  Unless it was some sort of browser or phone attack it should not be possible to authenticate 2FA unless Coinbase's 2FA system itself is compromised.

No bitcoin withdrawals, but maybe they'll re-enable those withdrawals eventually/maybe/one day?

Yes.  If you're specifically looking for exchanges you can use from the U.S. try one of these.

Two Factor Authentication.  I like Google Authenticator, but others prefer Authy, so that one is up to you.  Either is better just just a simple user/password login.
Coinbase has a minimum 2FA in the form of sending you a SMS text with the code, that's *mostly* reliable.  But you should try adding google Authenticator or Authy to your Coinbase account in case you can't receive the SMS texts from Coinbase somehow.
tip: If you use Google Authenticator, save the QR Code/authenticator code *offline* on a USB stick or similar, anything not connected to the internet.  In case you lose your phone ;)

Hmm.. I like Coinbase, can't really think of a downside offhand.  I mean, you *do* need to link a U.S. checking account to it.  Some people are skittish about that, personally I'd suggest keeping a spare checking account to link to Coinbase or other websites but that's just me.


Coinbase is more of a "broker", like a bitcoin store.  You buy/sell directly with them at their prices.  An exchange is similar to a stock exchange, you're buying/selling from other users on the exchange who are buying/selling.  You can also make more advanced trades on on exchange, e.g. buying/selling at specific prices, etc.
When you asked about an exchange I wasn't sure if you meant an actual exchange, or you're just looking to do a simple bitcoin buy somewhere. ;)


Coinbase works via ACH bank transfer.  Every time you initiate a buy Coinbase initiates an ACH transfer from your bank, these can take anywhere from 2-5-ish business days.  You're not actually waiting on Coinbase, you're really waiting for your bank to finish the ACH transfer to Coinbase.


The price you get is whatever price you initiated the order at.  e.g. if you buy today at $800, &amp; the ACH transfer takes 4 business days, so you get your bitcoin on Friday at the $800 price you initiated the order at.

No, you are not.  You seem to think that Coinbase is an exchange?  e.g. exchanges like Bitstamp, etc., you're buying/selling with other members on the exchange.
Coinbase is more of a "broker', or kind of like a bitcoin store.  You're buying/selling directly with Coinbase.
re: the delay, that's just Coinbase waiting for your bank's ACH transfer to come through.  ACH transfers can take anywhere from 2-5-ish business days.  The message you got, for example, they're predicting 4 business days for the ACH transfer to come through.  Once that comes through that means you've officially paid for your bitcoin &amp; Coinbase releases the bitcoin into your wallet.

Ah, OK.  In the U.S. you have a few options.  Coinbase is by far the easiest to use so you may want to start with them.
There's nothing wrong with using Bitstamp (esp if you're doing high volume trading) but you'd need to wait out the verification process.  Pretty much all the exchanges that deal with USD will require some sort of verification, though each does it a bit differently.

Interesting.. for IRS that means someone got your social security number.  AFAIK you didn't need to submit SSN for MtGox verification, correct?
Usually when it's identity theft &amp; it makes it way to the IRS (via W2, tax return etc.) the likely scenario is that someone is employed using your name/social security (ahem.. someone working in the U.S. without a valid social security number).  I've seen it happen before to other people &amp; usually it's that.
Either way identity theft *is* a very real concern, esp with regards to bitcoin exchanges.. seriously, how well *are* they securing our data?  I'm just not 100% sure if your specific issue would be connected with MtGox unless you somehow sent them your SSN and/or someone was savvy enough to obtain your MtGox info &amp; match it up with your (stolen separately) SSN.

Exchanges do not operate as you described.  The users on an exchange are buying &amp; selling from each other, neither are doing transactions directly with the exchange.
But to your point, Coinbase kind of acts as an in-between broker so you do buy/sell BTC directly with them.  I'd find it hard to believe they'd be a ponzi though, besides all the VC backing they must be making a ton in fees alone.  Seems more like a normal business to me.

Did some BTC deposits &amp; withdrawals yesterday &amp; today, no problems.  Thankfully their BTC withdrawals are always pretty fast compared to other exchanges.
re: USD, I've only ever deposited with USPS money orders &amp; that's worked OK in the past.  Not 100% how feasible it is to withdraw USD from there currently with their bank situation :/
I'd be curious if people have been receiving their $20 money order withdrawals after the ACH withdrawal was closed down, though I think it's a bit early to tell for sure.  According to the site they only do those like 1-2 times a week, so in theory no one would even receive any withdrawal money orders 'till maybe next week or the week after?
If you have BTC there I'd strongly suggest sending it to Coinbase to sell there &amp; deposit the USD into your checking account, much easier!
Incidentally, I've noticed the CampBX price has grown higher in comparison to Coinbase/Bitstamp/etc, not a good sign.

If your email was hacked then you would not have seen any of the email confirmations from Bitstamp.
Based on what you mentioned it sounds like either:
A. Did you have API Access enabled?  Someone may have gotten your API key.  (Bitstamp may be able to tell you what IP addresses accessed your account through API?)
B. Did you have your 2FA backed up somehow?  How did you have it backed up?  Could be your 2FA backup(s) was accessed somehow.

An exchange is somewhere where you're buying &amp; selling currency, stocks, etc, from other users on the same exchange looking to sell.  Exchanges have order books, each "buy" or "sell" gets listed on the order book.  You can also do more advanced types of buys/sells, e.g. "limit" buys/sells.  The exchange itself typically makes money off the transaction fees for each successful trade.  The price on an exchange moves up/down based on the price of each trade being made between users.
Coinbase does not meet any of that by definition.  There's no order book.  When you buy/sell on Coinbase you're not buying/selling from other users you are buying/selling from Coinbase directly.  Coinbase has their own algorithm to make up a price (though their algorithm seems to follow Bitstamp's price somewhat).
Coinbase is really more of a bitcoin retail store in that respect.

In general an exchange is similar to a stock exchange (in the U.S. think Wall st, NASDAQ, etc.).  You can do things like set multiple buys/sells at different prices, you're buying/selling BTC &amp; other currencies with other people on the same exchange, the price moves up/down based on the prices people are exchanging at, things like that.  You can probably Google around for a better definition ;)
Something not quite like an exchange, e.g. Coinbase, operates differently.  In Coinbase's case you're buying/selling BTC directly with them at Coinbase's prices (Coinbase has their own algorithm to determine price, they follow the Bitstamp price roughly speaking).

You don't, it doesn't work that way.  You need to contact Coinbase &amp; tell them specifically that you were using Google Authenticator, *not* Authy.
Ask them what their 2FA reset procedure is (I'm not sure how they handle these requests to be honest), what you really need is for them to reset your 2FA code on your account.
Most of the bitcoin exchanges will give you a mandatory waiting period (2 weeks, 1 month, whatever) before doing a 2FA reset, just not sure what Coinbase's policy is.

There are *always* going to be altcoins, that's just the nature of the game.  It's not really worth discussing, aside from downvoting the trolls.  (it's funny how the Doge peeps say they're all friendly yet keep trolling &amp; the other subs anyway).
I don't see any of the altcoins as any sort of "threat" to bitcoin, they're just testing grounds for new ideas, strategies, etc.
If anything, Doge might in fact surpass the other alts if it keeps its momentum (if so, it could be argued this may not be so great for litecoin &amp; others).  But most people only buy alts to trade for BTC or USD, so it's not like they're really taking anything from bitcoin IMO.
@_date: 2014-02-15 22:47:35


The issue might be that you're using Bitstamp as a bitcoin wallet.  Most of the exchanges are *really* slow when it comes to transmitting bitcoin transactions out to the network, not surprised at all that this happened to you unfortunately.
For spending bitcoin you'll have much better luck using a good wallet.  e.g. blockchain.info's wallet, or even one of the desktop/phone wallets, they're all faster than Bitstamp.  With a good wallet you'd see the transaction hit Bitpay almost instantly.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:57:14
Sending BTC out of Coinbase?  They're sometimes slow to broadcast the transaction out to the bitcoin network.  One time it took about 2-3 hours to send some BTC out of Coinbase :/
For now I wouldn't worry too much, unless it takes more than say 3 hours.  Coinbase is great, but their wallet sucks if you need to execute time sensitive transactions.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:25:50
Haven't had issues with them, but I'd suggest avoiding them for the time being.  With their current bank issues it's not possible to do any sort of bank transfers to/from them, &amp; their $20 money order withdrawal is supposedly backlogged so people aren't getting $$ out that way either.  At this point I wouldn't be surprised if they end up shutting down MtGox style. :/
If they fix their bank issues they may be worth another look eventually.

Maybe stick to mining doge?  I honestly didn't think mining doge with CPU was even viable, let alone bitcoin.
Or mine one of the CPU only coins (primecoin, quark, etc.).
Either way you won't be mining much.  This may be OK if your electricity is free &amp; you don't mind running your desktop/laptop into the ground with all the heat &amp; fan usage.  I used to mine primecoin w/ my 4th gen Core i7 CPU but eventually stopped, it just wasn't worth it.

You're kind of assuming Amazon would even use Coinbase.  It's true they could add Coinbase or Bitpay as kind of a plug-and-play payment option to their shopping cart &amp; call it a day.
But really, Amazon is so huge that they have enough software devs on staff to script bitcoind (or similar) to integrate bitcoin into their shopping cart on their own.  In fact it'd be advantageous for them to do so, they wouldn't need to pay any % fees to Coinbase/Bitpay by rolling their own solution.
Another advantage: If they roll their own solution then bitcoin is part of Amazon's native shopping cart, &amp; any 3rd parties using "Pay with Amazon" would instantly get bitcoin as a payment method through Amazon, if they wanted.  That would be significant, let alone just amazon.com accepting bitcoin.  (whether Amazon would care enough to go that far is debatable, of course)

Perhaps recommend people to run the full node with disablewallet enabled?  Then there will be no bitcoin wallet to steal.
Also, if you're not port-forwarding the RPC port then you're much less likely to be hacked anyway.  bitcoin-qt doesn't accept or understand commands on the port that is used for accepting connections from other nodes.
Of course, nothing is 100% hack proof, but really if you were going to be hacked it's unlikely to be through a bitcoin node.

I don't think anyone is dumping their bitcoin for dogecoin, are they? (wow, I hope not!)  It's not so much that anything is being taken away from bitcoin, doge just tends to attract more of the very new users (esp if they're into meme type things).  It's not a bad thing, people have to start somewhere :)  If those same users end up taking their crypto more seriously down the road then they're likely going to buy bitcoin at some point.
On the flip side, I think is actually gaining some more of the more serious users since the Doge devs decides to leave their currency uncapped, though I guess that's an entirely different topic.

That's a good question.. offhand I don't think so?  That's not an issue I've ever had, or have heard of happening.
Someone else may be able to clarify, my impression is that Coinbase likes to queue up their outgoing transfers to the Blockchain &amp; send them out in batches.  This is why sometimes people initiate an outgoing transfer, but the transfer doesn't even hit the blockchain until Coinbase gets around to it.  Normally it's still pretty fast, but as you can tell sometimes there are hiccups in the system ;)

This sounds like a good thing for the founders at Gyft who managed to cash out before First Data "reorganizes" the company.
Not so good for bitcoin, AFAIK there hasn't been any indication that First Data even *wants* to be associated with bitcoin, let alone explore the bitcoin economy.  If you follow the $$ First Data stands to lose a ton of it if bitcoin were to catch on, it's probably more profitable for them to have Gyft stop accepting bitcoin or shut it down altogether.  But who knows, maybe there's unannounced projects in the works at First Data re: bitcoin, guess we'll see where they're at in a year.

Did you search ?  If you're attempting USD withdrawal to a U.S. bank, this is not possible.  People say to wait 6+ months, but even then it's not a given that you'd get a withdrawal.

I'm not sure where you're getting the idea of bitcoin stocks/options.  There isn't anything different about getting paid in bitcoin, you still need to pay your taxes on income.  This varies depending on what country you're in, of course.
In the U.S. I'd assume the taxes are either being withheld from your bitcoin payout (e.g. typical salary worker with all taxes withheld so you get a net payment), or you're freelance &amp; will pay the IRS the taxes owed via a 1099 or similar.  Also keep in mind the U.S. (&amp; likely other governments) does not accept tax payments in bitcoin, so you'd still be paying them in USD or whatever fiat your country accepts taxes in.

PP does not provide buyer/seller protection for any transactions related to bitcoin or cryptocurrency.  PP might give you back your $$, it's tough to say..  usually they do, just don't expect too much support from them regarding the matter.
If anything there's a chance PP might suspend your account due to being used for a bitcoin-related transaction, but hopefully not..
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:59:02
I don't think you can make many changes to your PP account once something is in dispute.  Not to mention PP can simply claw back the funds from previously linked bank account or CC info.
If you *really* wanted to, you could try canceling any linked CC/bank accounts to PP, or changing those account numbers, or taking the $$ out of the linked bank account, etc.
I'm not really an expert on that stuff so you may want to Google around.

Nope, just deposit cash at any Wells Fargo into SnapSwap's checking account.  Afterwards SnapSwap credits your account with the deposited USD, which you can then send to Bitstamp via Ripple.
(SnapSwap also allows you to do ACH deposits into their Wells Fargo bank account but I've never tried that yet)

Banks typically limit liability to $50 when "fraud" is concerned.  (liability for the customer claiming fraudulent transactions).
So what happens with the other $50+?  Banks, much like Paypal &amp; other similar organizations, will do everything they can to *not* be the one left holding the bag in these cases.  So yeah, they *will* claw back the funds based on a dispute rather than pay out of their own pocket.
I'm too lazy to read my bank account's fine print on this stuff but I wouldn't be surprised if this is mentioned there somewhere.
BTW, you brought up CC, but you do realize CC works the same exact way?  If a CC chargeback occurs the CC issuer is never the one that eats the chargeback.  That $$ is taken out of the merchant's bank account.

Technically they haven't re-enabled bitcoin withdrawals, so even with verification you would not have been able to withdraw anyway.

Offhand you should be able to use Localbitcoins, or maybe Bitstamp, since they're more international.
There may also be local exchanges in Mexico, maybe someone closer to you can provide some suggestions :)
EDIT: Sorry, I thought you meant you were looking to buy bitcoin ;)  For *using* bitcoin, if you can get the bitcoin to your phone (if you have a smartphone) that would be easiest.  e.g. If you have an Android phone try installing Mycelium or Bitcoin Wallet, then send some bitcoin from whatever wallet you have over to your phone.  At that point you can easily buy something at 7-11 by sending bitcoin from your phone to their bitcoin address/QR Code.
And/or keep your bitcoin on a web wallet, e..g Blockchain.info, then with the app installed on your phone you can initiate a send from your phone to 7-11's bitcoin address/QR Code.

Bitcoin, yes.  Cash, no.
You can sort-of withdraw cash if you are withdrawing JPY to a Japan bank, or withdrawing EUR via SEPA to a EUR country that participates in SEPA transfers.  Those methods seem to take maybe 4+ weeks or so.

Offhand I'd say BitSimple is the closest, but they're not quite there yet (they only do domestic bank wires AFAIK).  IMO being able to do bank ACH transfers would be key, unfortunately the *only* service in the U.S. that is able to do that is Coinbase.

Realistically speaking ... if you didn't backup the wallet.dat file then it's highly unlikely that you ever exported the private keys either.


The private keys to each of your bitcoin addresses are stored inside the encrypted wallet.dat file you already DBAN'd.  (your bitcoin-qt passphrase decrypts the wallet.dat file to allow you access to those private keys).  Unless you backed them up or something then it's not possible to find those.

For a lot of the bigger laws/regulations, especially on new stuff, certain states tend to take the lead on it &amp; then other states follow the example.  (historically this has often been CA or NY)
So yes, it's somewhat important b/c if NY, for example, says people need "bitlicenses" then all the other states will eventually follow along with similar regulation.  At that point the only way to override that is with regulation happening on the federal level I think..  which *could* happen, being that bitcoin allows for interstate trade which falls under the Fed's jurisdiction.

U.S. banks have a lot of regulations, typically you're going to need at least a social security number, proof of address (legal documents e.g. driver's license or similar), will need to physically be in the U.S., etc.  It wasn't always that way, one of those "post 9/11" things.

I have a feeling it would be much more complicated than that. Wouldn't you need to link your bank account for deposits/withdrawals? I'd imagine the bank account itself would need to be tied to a non-NY address. Or is that not part of KYC?
Or you're saying to open an out-of-state bank account using a U.S. proxy address? U.S. banks would normally have to follow their own regulations ("anti-terrorism", etc.) &amp; wouldn't open a bank account for you using a random mailing address you give them. You'd have to start looking into having utilities, drivers license, etc. using that proxy address. Not saying that it's impossible, but that's sort of a gray area that people normally don't get into. Legally questionable as well.
OTOH maybe opening a out-of-state LLC would work, not sure on the procedures for that sort of thing. Although that could be a different set of issues, you might end up in a different fee bracket with different regulations if you're claiming to be a business dealing with bitcoin.

You're going to need to get that wallet synced if you want to eventually spend spend that bitcoin, or export/import that bitcoin address private key into another wallet to spend it from another wallet.

It's definitely there now, if you log into your Ripple wallet, click Trade, then look at BTC/XRP there's a huge bid/ask order book.  I'm still new to the Ripple thing so am not sure exactly how it works, though I do have SnapSwap &amp; Bitstamp set up through there (SnapSwap is the gateway, I think).
Seems interesting but I've never tried it yet.  (though I do use Ripple to send USD to Bitstamp, better than international wire transfers IMO)

Yeah...  but does that really make sense?  Dorian also [claimed to the AP] (that he heard about bitcoin 3 weeks ago via his son, who was contacted *by a reporter*.  So now a reporter shows up on his doorstep &amp; he claims he has no idea what she was asking about?
I doubt he'd be confused unless he's been having reporters show up on his doorstep every other day asking about random crap, maybe.  Or we pretend he's old &amp; gets confused easily, even when he basically had the same question from his own son 3 weeks prior.  (I mean, it's possible sure, just seems kind of stretch after already being asked about something called "bitcoin")
I don't really care all that much about figuring out whether he's Satoshi, or someone else is, etc., but Dorian's explanation doesn't quite make sense IMO.

Maybe your Authy account itself compromised? That sort of compromise would defeat all your 2FA protections at Coinbase.
Did you check that your Authy account is still set to the same phone number? Can't find the post but I remember someone complaining on Reddit about how trivial it was to have Authy change the account to a new phone number.
Caveat: I don't use Authy, just read about these sort of hacks.
EDIT: Also double-check your other accounts, especially email, to see if it was accessed by an unknown IP.. it would be pretty easy for someone to simply delete/reroute any alerts to connected email addresses that way.

AFAIK they haven't been processing BTC withdrawals for weeks or months at least. Search the sub.. not sure when they last successfully processed BTC withdrawals.
Most people withdraw using various alt coins, the less "busy" ones still manage to withdraw. Yes, that means you'll likely trade at a loss to get a withdraw from Cryptsy.
Also double-check your withdraw limits, you won't be able to withdraw 2 BTC worth immediately with all their withdraw limits (supposedly more if you verify).

Yes &amp; no.. remember that CC charges are reversible, so Coinbase is taking a bigger risk having to charge a CC at all.  OTOH I imagine you might get kicked off Coinbase if you were to chargeback a BTC order like that.
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:30:12
Coinbase instant buy just means that they still do the transaction through your U.S. bank. The CC is only charged if something goes wrong with the bank transfer (e.g. low funds, etc.). The CC is mostly on file as a backup payment method, not to be used as a primary.

It's probably just more labor intensive AFAICT.
e.g. [with USPS] ( you can't even buy money orders over $1k, &amp; they won't let you buy over $10k worth of money orders in a day (though I think after a few $k the USPS clerk may get weirded out about the sale).
Not sure on the other services but I'd expect similar limitations, which would mean spending a lot of time going to/from USPS/etc just to buy limited quantities of money orders.  Though with this ACH news it does sound like CampBX is going to end up spending *a lot* of time doing this now.

The blockchain is basically a public ledger so if they wanted they can track outgoing transactions from their bitcoin address. At a basic level you can try that yourself (e.g. see 
That said, I'm not sure if Coinbase is literally tracking the entire history of every future transaction that originated from a Coinbase bitcoin address. They for sure track the *first* outgoing transaction but are they also tracking transactions afterwards? My hunch is maybe not, we only ever hear about people having problems with outgoing transactions directly from Coinbase. I'm curious if anyone knows if Coinbase is actually tracking tracking transactions even further out?

re: wallet, Yes probably.. You'll need to export the private keys from your current wallet to import into somewhere else. Been a while since I've done that so you may need to search around for a how-to, or hopefully someone else can better assist.

When did you initiate it? You mentioned Saturday January 16th but Saturdays-Sundays are off-days for U.S. banks. On top of that Monday January 18th was also a U.S. bank holiday.
What I'm saying is if you initiated this on a Saturday, the U.S. banks didn't even get started on the transfer until Tuesday January 19th, &amp; you still need to give them 3-5-ish business days from there. I'd say if you still haven't received it after Tuesday January 26th then *maybe* I'd start worrying, otherwise you've literally only waited 1 business day.
(this is assuming the transfer was initiated on Saturday January 16th, &amp; this is a ACH transfer)

Yup, that makes a huge difference.  You're not going to be able to withdraw USD from MtGox to a U.S. bank account (like you already know).
In the U.S. Coinbase is easiest, but you have a few other options if you're looking to trade BTC for USD.  Depends a bit on what method you're comfortable using.
 * [Coinbase] ( (ACH deposit to your bank account)
 * [BitQuick.co] ( (sell to someone via bank deposit)
 * [LocalBitcoins] ( (sell to someone via cash, bank deposit, etc)
 * [BitSimple] ( (domestic wire transfer I think)
 * [CampBX] ( (ACH transfer to your bank account)
 * [CoinMKT] ( (domestic wire transfer)
 * [Bitstamp] ( (international wire transfer)
 * [Vault of Satoshi] ( (international wire transfer, I think)
 * [Litetree] ( (domestic wire transfer, I think)
 * [Kraken] ( (they don't do USD trades in all 50 states yet, but if they're available in your state then you can withdraw via domestic wire transfer)

You normally can't buy pre-paid credit/debit cards with CC, those are cash-only purchases at most locations. Is this something you've done before, or maybe just one particular CVS/Rite Aid is letting you do that?
That *might* work if the CC transaction is being done as a cash advance against your CC but there's big fees if you're doing that. The fees are definitely higher than any airline points you'd get.

Not really, lots of PayPal+Bitcoin scams.  Remember that PP is a reversible payment method so you have to hope that whoever you're sending PP funds trusts you enough not to reverse the transaction on them a few months later.
Also keep in mind PP does not like cryptocurrencies &amp; may put a freeze on accounts involved if they figure out you were buying bitcoin using their service.
Only way I can see that working is if you have a friend/someone who trusts you that has BTC &amp; is OK receiving PP funds for it.

Just to clarify, you sent litecoin to a litecoin address.  It's not possible to send litecoin to a bitcoin address, or vice versa.
That destination litecoin address just happens to also exist in the bitcoin blockchain as its own unique bitcoin address.  (there are certain addresses that exist in both blockchains)  You're basically screwed unless you know the owner of that litecoin address you sent to. (EDIT: You mentioned Bitfinex in your other post, are you sure Bitfinex owns that litecoin address you sent to? If so, contact them)
Feel free to double-check by looking up that destination litecoin address (or transaction id) in a litecoin blockchain explorer.

Wow, I didn't realize CampBX is still up. They're basically on life support, not sure why you'd want to send any $$ there.
Also, both CampBX &amp; Coinbase don't have anything set up with Dwolla so you can't send Dwolla funds to either of them... In case it's not obvious there aren't any bitcoin-related businesses that deal with Dwolla nowadays. Not to mention Dwolla would cancel your transfer &amp; close your account if they think you're doing anything related to bitcoin.
Really your only recourse would be to withdraw from Dwolla into your own U.S. bank account, &amp; from there do what you want with your $$.
Coinbase &amp; Circle  is capable of doing ACH withdrawals from U.S. bank account so you could set yourself up at either &amp; fund your purchases from your bank account.

I bet it's because their verification provider isn't capable of verifying passports. Likely nothing to do with KYC requirements. Passports are way more verified vs a simple state-issued identification AFAIK.

This is going to sound dumb, but do you know if your particular address exists in an alt coin blockchain? I remember seeing this happen with LTC.. Could be someone with multiple coins (BTC, LTC, etc.) thought they were sending x coins to their LTC address but accidentally sent x amount of coins from their BTC holdings instead, which went to that address on the BTC blockchain. (e.g. from a multi-coin exchange, perhaps) The "from" addresses would probably correspond with an exchange if that were the case.

Bitcoin Core does have a -upgradewallet command line option you can run when launching bitcoin-qt, that should upgrade the wallet.dat to the current version. I'm not sure that you absolutely need to run that (this might happen automatically?) but worst case you can try that out.

Sorry, I didn't pick up anything about you trying to accept Paypal/CC for bitcoin on your own website.
Well btcquick &amp; coinmama do it by charging extra in fees.  Basically, try to cover yourself for all the CC fraud you're going to attract.  You're going to lose at least some $$ due to fraud, no way to get around it, but if your honest sales are enough to accumulate fees to cover the bad sales then you're good.
re: Paypal, [eobot] ( used to accept Paypal but they'd hold Paypal orders for 45 days (45 days is the window Paypal gives users to [dispute a transaction] ( so that's an idea.

Ah, Bitfloor was my first bitcoin experience too, though luckily I was using them before their bank problems.  They were awesome when they were up &amp; running, it was so easy to go to a bank, deposit cash into their bank account, &amp; then trade away.  Even now there aren't any major exchanges that make depositing straight cash *that* easy (e.g. Gox, CampBX).
Luckily I only had maybe maybe like $.01 when they had their bank problems so it wasn't a big deal.  It sucks that they had their bank issues just as you were about to use them, but hopefully it doesn't put you off from bitcoin in general.  There's a lot more stability w/ buying bitcoin nowadays so it's unlikely you'll hit another crazy issue like we had with Bitfloor.

You just have to download/install a wallet app on your computer.  Kind of your personal preference, offhand check out    or even the default [bitcoin-qt] ( app.  Whatever you use, make sure you encrypt/passphrase it, &amp; make sure you know how to back up your wallet!

Transferring bitcoin is easy, just send bitcoin from your Coinbase account to any of your generated addresses in your wallet app (usually they call it the "Receive" address, depends on the app you end up using).  If you're not sure how to work it, send a small-ish amount first (e.g. .01 or whatever) just to make sure you see how the transfer works.

Just read the Paypal link.  Paypal gives users 45 days to dispute a transaction.  So in theory, if you sell via Paypal &amp; give someone their BTC within those 45 days then the person can dispute the charge &amp; get their $$ back (&amp; keep the BTC).  So a way to get around that is to deliver the BTC only *after* the 45 days.  It's kind of a crappy way to do business though, not sure who would actually want to put in a Paypal for BTC order &amp; wait 45 days for their BTC.
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:44:21
Correct.  Unfortunately this means it'd be very easy to reverse the charge w/ Paypal.  OP's PP account will end up being limited for at least 6 months and/or closed outright simply due to not following PP's terms.
But ultimately it depends on the buyer, if the buyer isn't a scammer everything should be fine.

I dunno, if they don't feel like accepting bitcoin donations then they're just not that interested in receiving donations IMO.  Same with Wikipedia.
Maybe with non-profits it'd require some extra work on their part, since they may need to keep track of where the donations come from &amp; be able to send donators donation tax info.  Hardly impossible, but obvs more difficult than just throwing up a BTC address on your webpage &amp; calling it a day.
That said, I *do* try to donate to various non-profits, software projects/developers, etc when possible.  This is the first year I've tried to do that exclusively using bitcoin &amp; found some nice surprises. (aside from the obvious bitcoin-related projects)

In the U.S. you'd do a domestic bank wire transfer to/from Kraken.  I haven't done it myself but should be fairly workable.
There are are a few other exchanges you can consider depending on your needs
 * CampBX (USPS money order deposits, ACH withdrawals)
 * Coinmkt (USPS money order deposits, domestic bank wire withdrawals)
If you're trading in volume you should really consider Bitstamp, that's where all the action is.  (deposit/withdrawals would be via international wire transfer)

Or alternatively, log into all those sites, turn off/on Google Authenticator but for your 2nd time around make sure to grab a screenshot of each QR Code &amp; save that in an *offline* backup (e.g. on a USB key).  Don't save those on any connected computers/etc, otherwise you're defeating the purpose of using 2FA ;)

re: U.S. exchanges, it's easy to fund CampBX &amp; Coinmkt via money order, though that's definitely a hassle.  (CampBX will be able to fund via ACH deposit towards the end of November if that helps)
I'm not on BTC-E or Bitstamp, but I think Bitstamp can accept Ripple deposits.  Haven't done this myself, but in theory you can sign up for a [Ripple wallet] ( then sign up for Ripple gateway in the U.S. ([Snapswap] ( fund your Snapswap/Ripple account via ACH deposit, then send the XRP from there to Bitstamp.  Bitstamp receives it as USD &amp; then you're ready to trade.
At least I think that's how it'd work?  Was planning to do this myself in the near future, though maybe someone else in has already done this.

What is "viable" to help the network?  Certainly not viable ROI b/c that won't ever happen, but even these ASICs help the overall network hashrate, no?  Plus you'd also help secure the network against a theoretical 51% attack.  Of course maybe I'm misunderstanding how this works ;)

Oh, definitely.  This will become much like bittorrent management is at the moment.  e.g. Bittorrent today has protocol encryption to deal with this.  While expensive/time consuming/controversial, ISPs can figure out torrent traffic patterns &amp; attack *that* (e.g. [sandvine] ( etc.).  You could in theory pursue the same or similar methods for Bitcoin.
Of course, *all* ISPs would need to be legally compelled to ever bother with anything like that.  And we're not even talking about the legal precedent of actually enforcing internet censorship in the U.S.


You do have a point there, though that'd be a tough thing to implement.  Encryption is pretty much *everywhere* nowadays, e.g. just to check your email, let alone for crypto currency usage.

Whoa, that's pretty cool, hadn't heard of it before.  Do you use it?  What price do they use to exchange BTC to fiat onto the debit card?  The website says a 5% fee, but doesn't mention what BTC price they are using.  (e.g. Gox, Bitcoinaverage, or just their own rate..?)

AFAIK you do not need to be verified just to fund a MtGox account.
You *do* need to be verified if you ever want to withdraw any funds or BTC, so really you're going to have to go through verification at some point.
Not sure about your other question, maybe the transfer is just kind of slow right now?  You can check on blockchain if you have the transaction ID for your BTC transfer to MtGox.

If you're in the U.S., check out CampBX or Coinmkt (money order deposits, ugh).  Or if you're OK w/ doing USD wire transfer deposits then best to stick w/ Bitstamp, or try out Kraken.
Or if you're just looking to do some simple buying/selling of bitcoins without doing the whole exchange thing then check out Coinbase, Localbitcoins, or BitQuick.co.

 1. Log into Cryptsy, click the Balances button at the top
 2. Next to Bitcoin click BTC Actions &amp; select Deposit/Autosell BTC (copy this bitcoin address, it's your Cryptsy deposit address!)

Not for Bitstamp, but you *can* mail USPS money orders to CampBX or Coinmkt if you're in the U.S.  Not sure if that's really what you were looking for.
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:25:49
It's normal when you're starting out.  Remember that ACH transfers take 3-5 *business* days, there's nothing Coinbase can do about that one.  And Monday 11/11 is Veteran's day, so that day doesn't even count b/c it's a bank holiday ;)
30 days after your first successful purchase your account will become level 2 verified, so you can place larger orders.  And then, if you link a VISA card you can do "instant" purchases of bitcoin.  Coinbase's instant purchases are really where it's at, but you need to become fully verified to get to that point.

You're comparing to the Gox price (currently $140 USD).  Gox's BTC price isn't realistic at this point so it's a bit worthless to compare them to anywhere else.  Most users can't transfer any fiat out of Gox so that $140 USD price is artificially high.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:50:42
Yes, it's possible to do some limited arbitrage.  Just make sure to check how easy it is to get USD in/out of the different exchanges.
Wouldn't bother doing this w/ Gox, it's kind of pointless since you can't get USD out of there.  If you sell BTC there you're kind of stuck until you decide to buy more BTC at the Gox price (thus keeping Gox's BTC price artificially higher than everywhere else).

Maybe you meant "the Bitcoin users will ultimately be using whatever block chain the miners choose"?  The miners do have some influence over the block chain being used.  e.g. if the majority reach consensus on forking the chain they could do it, in theory.  That'd cause a majority of bitcoin transactions generated onto the new chain.  (assuming it's not a full consensus this would end up being a 51% attack)

@_date: 2013-10-22 13:24:48
That might work?  It seems very odd to fund something like that with a CC.  Overall the fees would be higher vs sending a money order to CampBX, but might come out cheaper than a wire (depending on the amount you're sending)
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:57:23
Did you search first?  The withdrawal issues @ Gox are not new.
I think (correct me if I'm wrong), people trying to do arbitrage @ Gox are probably trying to sell btc for a high price, then wait to see if the btc value goes down so they buy back in at a lower price.  They can't get their fiat out so it's not like they can do a withdrawal after selling any btc there.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:09:28
You should really enable two factor authentication to avoid this sort of thing (technically should be doing it on all bitcoin &amp; bank related websites).  In BTC-E that's under Profile / Security.

Just hold onto your BTC, no need to cash them out as soon as you get them.  If you buy a little at a time you'll eventually accumulate enough to make exchanging them worth it, if you want.
BTC value will go up/down as the exchange rate changes, but eventually when/if you cash them out you should be able to time it to keep your value at about the same, or maybe even make some extra in value.

 * Kraken (domestic wire transfer deposit)
 * Localbitcoins

In theory if someone is actually a licensed money transmitter then they *will* need your ID.  (but not your bank card)  That's the way it works if you change currency somewhere (your EUR for USD, for example).
Thing is, most/all sellers are LBC aren't technically licensed so wouldn't require this sort of thing.  And even then, no need for your bank card either.
So.. I'd avoid that particular seller.

There's at least two issues with this approach:
 * The buyer isn't protected b/c the seller can sweep the bitcoin address if they keep the private key (like said)
 * The seller isn't protected if the buyer puts in a SNAD dispute.  e.g. "this QR code is just a link to a website, it's not a bitcoin!" or similar.

This.  One of the strongest selling points is other merchants using the same tools, even better if it's another local business.
A plus would be if a local business is willing to be a "reference" for a new business to ask them how the bitcoin setup process went.  But that'll be tough unless you personally helped them with the set up &amp; can ask to use them as a reference for other businesses.  This is how it works when you set up a business with a new ISP, new POS system, etc, they'll always want to know who else is using it.

 * Paypal won't process payments for miners, so if they notice your auction was for a bitcoin miner they may freeze your account, etc.  It's a bit disingenuous for Ebay to to allow those auctions to go through while letting the Paypal side screw the seller over on that.  You don't have to believe me of course, just search around on Google/Reddit/etc. for all the sellers who got screwed by Paypal on that.
Bottom line: Ebay &amp; Paypal suck.

Do you mean an incorrect *valid* address?  Those bitcoins aren't lost at all.  But they're probably lost to *you* forever, unless the receiver is nice enough to send them back to you.
If you meant incorrect *invalid* addresses, that's not possible.  Those would bounce back to you, I think?  (not sure on the process on how that works)
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:51:25
There are other exchanges, but none of them are as fast/convenient as Coinbase.  It depends on what you're after.
Been using CampBX for a while, no problems with them.  (I'm also verified there now)  It *is* annoying having to mail in a USPS money order for USD deposit, then wait for them to get it, then wait for them to credit your account, but it's always worked out for me.  The exchange doesn't have nearly the volume of Bitstamp, but there's enough activity for light trading IMO.
re: before you deposit anything, make sure you read their [FAQ] ( I think they have daily deposit/withdrawal limits for unverified users ($1000).
There is another US exchange: Coinmkt, could be worth a look.  They also accept money order deposits, but also accept bank wire transfers.  The site is still very beta feeling, kind of sluggish &amp; not much activity which kind of causes the prices there to remain high (sucks if you're buying).  This might improve over time, right now I'd stick w/ CampBX.
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:06:24

In the U.S. Coinbase is the easiest to fund by far.  The other easy ones are bitquick.co, Localbitcoins, CampBX, &amp; Coinmkt.
The others are good too (e.g. Bitstamp has the largest trade volume vs anything based in the U.S.) but you'd be looking at doing international wire transfers or similar if you need to transfer USD.


Correct, transferring BTC between the different services/exchanges is the easy part.

Pretty much everyone in has been saying this.
It sucks, but I don't really know what you can do :/  For now you're going to have to wait for BTC-E &amp; see what they say?  If you're lucky they really did get the funds back in their account &amp; they can simply credit your BTC-E account with those funds.
To be honest I've always wondered why/how BTC-E is allowing withdraw to Paypal, they must be using multiple Paypal accounts in case things like this happen.  Keep in mind the Paypal account that BTC-E used for your particular transaction is probably also being limited/suspended, that's how Paypal works when this sort of thing happens.

Assuming you're in the U.S..
Coinbase might be the easiest?  Your buyer will still need to set up an account &amp; link up his/her bank account, so it would take a few business days for the whole thing to go through.  It'd be kind of like setting up a Paypal account for the first time.

Not necessarily true.  While it was never proven I have a feeling [this guy's] (Coinbase account was hacked even though he had 2FA enabled.  How?  Because Coinbase is allowing two stupid security lapses.
 * You can save your login/password on any browser you use for Coinbase: 
 * You can save your 2FA code for 30 days on any browser you use for Coinbase 
On the one hand I kind of expect the login/password saving feature (I wouldn't do it for security, but can see others doing it for convenience).  But I don't understand why Coinbase allows saving the 2FA.  The problem is if a computer is hacked (or, you unwittingly checked those two boxes on a shared computer at work/school/whatever) then someone has instant access to your Coinbase account, &amp; yes your bank account.
So yes, Coinbase can be secure, but don't *ever* save that login/password/2FA on any browsers.
Forgot to add: As an aside, Coinbase discontinued the 50 BTC instant buys right after that.  I really don't think it's a random coincidence..
@_date: 2013-08-21 16:16:13
It's been discussed before, you did a search already right?  e.g.
You certainly wouldn't be able to guess at this juncture.  Maybe in a few decades people studying the blockchain will notice addresses w/ bitcoin that haven't been touched for decades &amp; consider those "lost".  It's not a bad thing for the bitcoin community, unspendable coin helps keep the price up overall so it's kind of a donation to the community if you think about it.

Yes those other amounts are transaction fees.  It might help to think of them in terms of BTC, not as USD.
The fee itself isn't strictly .0005 BTC, it may end up being higher/lower depending on a bunch of other factors.  Mostly I'd expect that Coinbase probably pulls the amounts from a bunch of different sized inputs, your 
"wallet" there is really just part of a larger pool of bitcoins on their end, it's not all in one address.  Hopefully someone can explain this better than me ;)

Won't help much in this case, but for anyone reading this PLEASE enable two factor authentication on both your GMail account &amp; BTC-E account.  (preferably w/ Google Authenticator or Authy)
Using BTC-E with just a 2FA email confirmation, with the emails being sent to an email address not protected by its own 2FA, is basically the same as not bothering enabling any sort of security at all.
OP, was it your laptop that was accessed remotely?  I'm only asking b/c the hack you described could have been accomplished by simply hacking your GMail account password.  Once in your GMail it would be trivial to see one of the BTC-E "Successful authorization" emails, saw your BTC-E username, then go to BTC-E &amp; reset your email/pw.

The ACH system in the U.S. is *not* instant, so Coinbase lending you instant BTC while they wait for the ACH withdrawal to catch up is very much a loan.  It would be awesome if the ACH system was in fact instant, but we're not there yet unfortunately.
Your argument is more along the lines of building trust.  It's a valid argument, but don't pretend that a loan isn't a loan.  So the question is, do trusted users merit free loans?  I'm not sure if Coinbase is really in a position to do that..  they could in theory offer "instant" loans to trusted users for a higher fee, over time they'll have enough in the reserves to cover random users that didn't have the cash in their bank account.  But of course you'll just rant that Coinbase should not raise fees or charge fees for the privilege of an instant buy.

Ah, fair enough.  If other users vouched for them (&amp; presumably received orders from them) then it's likely they're legit in some sense, though maybe new to e-commerce.  If that's the case it's totally possible it's just 1-2 guys &amp; they're just on vacation or something.

POS, as in buying something physically at a retail store w/ bitcoin?  Those sales taxes get collected by the retail establishment &amp; then *they* pay the sales tax to the state/local government.  So in regards to that scenario, you'd already be paying the sales tax.  There's no reason a retail establishment would decline to collect sales tax for your purchase just b/c you're using a different currency.
note: that's how it works in the U.S., not sure on other countries re: sales tax collection.

If you're able to it'd be interesting to hear what their followup is.
AFAICT connecting Dwolla to Coinmkt or CampBX should be fine w/ their TOS, there isn't anything stopping Dwolla from completely cutting off Coinmkt/CampBX if they felt otherwise.  (they did it to Gox so why not?)
I know they're not as happy about people using Dwolla to sell bitcoins directly to other persons (P2P), e.g. through Localbitcoins, but that seems like a different use-case. (ref: [this reddit post] (@_date: 2013-08-29 20:59:13

Coinbase takes a while to respond to requests, but they do respond.  (my last communication took 10 days to hear back from them, if that means anything)

You can also try something [like this] (  To be honest, it looks like Coinbase support emails are routed through Amazon SES so I'm not 100% sure how to verify they're really from coinbase.com.

Yeah... I looked at a few of those, &amp; many of them don't even have a viable method of funding from the U.S.  That's when I gave up ;)  But seriously, maybe someone that's been sending USD in/out of there can chime in on this one.
Personally I'm comfortable mailing money orders to fund CampBX/Coinmkt in the U.S.  Luckily CampBX will be implementing ACH deposits in November which would make them the easiest exchange to fund in the U.S.  (outside of exchanges, there's also Coinbase or Localbitcoins for us in the U.S. )

If anonymity is important to you then stick to cash transaction via Localbitcoins.

Weird, I'd think the "suspicious activity" is the other way around.  If you're accessing your account from multiple IPs that would definitely look suspicious.
It's also possible, if you're staying at a hotel, that there are other people at the same hotel that are accessing other Gox accounts.  This means that yes, that hotel's IP address is accessing multiple Gox accounts.  Maybe let them know you accessed your account from a shared (hotel) internet IP &amp; see what they say?

If you're unverified *don't* send them more than $1000 at a time.  It's like you're begging for a problem to occur.
Personally I've had no problems with CampBX.  Mailed them a $1000 USPS money order about 2 weeks ago, took about a week to process &amp; they credited my account.
Sucks about the verification though.. I submitted verification about.. I think 2-3 months ago, they took something like 4 weeks to process it but they did eventually verify my account.
Though I haven't had issues with them, definitely have read that others have had problems.  Tip: Before mailing them a money order take a picture of the filled out USPS money order before dropping it in the mail!  (&amp; keep the receipt!)  Apparently support will ask for that if you have issues with a deposit.
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:37:48
No way.  I do try to buy some every month if the paycheck allows, but no need to go overboard.  Maybe half to spend &amp; half to hold onto for the future.  Honestly if people are just obtaining bitcoins to hold onto, rather than spend them on anything, then we may as well give up on bitcoin now.
Your post does make me think of all the people trying to sell defaulted notes on btcjam, people that gave someone 20-30 btc thinking they'd get rich quick on a 20% return &amp; instead lost all those coins.  Be careful "investing" out there ;)

No, you just go to that bank, fill out a deposit slip, get in line for the tellers, hand them the *exact* cash deposit + deposit slip, say you're doing a deposit there.  That's pretty much it, has nothing to do with your own bank details.
@_date: 2013-09-09 02:32:51

@_date: 2013-09-16 20:52:45
I mostly use CampBX at the moment since I can set up more advanced trades (e.g. limit buys) on there.
Nothing wrong w/ Coinbase, they're very useful for buying coins at market rates or just for doing quicker buys.  OTOH they did cancel my last order due to "high risk", so they can be a bit annoying sometimes!
@_date: 2013-10-30 04:21:11
There's a lot of different opinions on this.
I agree with you, if no one is spending any bitcoins then there's no point for merchants to bother jumping through the hoops trying to accept them, let alone your own friends &amp; family.  And if no one bothers building out services to accept them more easily (which won't happen if merchants/etc. don't care for it) then the whole bitcoin idea just dies on the vine.
Right now I don't *think* that is happening, lots of momentum with different businesses/services appearing every day to deal with bitcoin transactions.  We're still in the early days so it's hard to say how things will play out in 10 years.
That said, you've got to accumulate a share of them for yourself to at least spend some later, so I think of it more as saving up to spend some as purchase decisions come up.
It's been discussed before of course, e.g. @_date: 2013-12-08 15:55:12
Depends on which country you're in.  If you're in the U.S. avoid MtGox (you won't be able to withdraw $$ out of there).
If you're outside the U.S. you should be able to use either, though I think Kraken is slightly faster processing SEPA transfers.  (I'm in the U.S. so can't say for sure, just read that from other Redditors)
Other stuff: MtGox has higher trade volume vs Kraken, but Kraken also supports altcoins besides bitcoin (if any of that matters to you).

@_date: 2013-12-24 16:08:16
Officially, they don't support debit cards. But I think when they initially rolled out the CC verify thing they may have accidentally allowed for adding VISA debit cards.  AFAICT they "fixed" that now, so newer Coinbase users won't be able to link a debit card.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:07:55
Here you go :)
In short: Email them to ask to review your order, &amp; if possible re-instate your order at the original sale price.  And also ask to "whitelist" your account.  Worked for everyone else w/ the same problem.
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:56:34
Just do a small purchase, once successful that'll get the 30-day countdown started.  After 30 days you'll be able to do instant buys as long as you're level 2 verified.
You can technically keep placing orders during the 30 day window if you like, just be prepared for the 5 day hold on your orders.
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:02:36
Indeed.. I wish we knew what Coinbase is verifying against ;)
Most of the CC systems I've worked with are only configured to check the street address numbers (e.g. the "123" in 123 main street) + the 5-digit zip code.  The other info tends to be ignored unless the CC AVS is configured differently.

From sidebar *Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed* --&gt;
Try @_date: 2013-11-02 20:14:22
Avoid Gox.
Coinbase is easiest.
For USD you could also try CampBX (.55% trade commissions, $2 ACH bank fee).  Or Coinmkt (.5% for a money order withdrawal or bank wire).
Bitstamp is the bigger exchange but you'd need to do bank wire transfers (or maybe transfers through Ripple, not sure how that works exactly).
And there's always Localbitcoins or bitquick.co if you're looking to sell for USD.
@_date: 2013-09-10 22:27:33
 - For *just* crypto you probably don't need to register as a money transmitter.  From  my understanding that only applies if you're converting any virtual currencies in/out of real-world money, e.g. BTC to USD or USD to BTC.  (someone correct me if I'm wrong?)
 - Offhand I'd stay good 2FA (both on logins and any outgoing currency transfers).  Advanced trade options maybe.  It would also be nice if more exchanges made it easier to do the calculations for buys/sells, like say I want to spend X amount of btc including fees but I want the website to figure out the exact buy/sell cost + fee..like a combination of CampBX's Spend-X + Cryptsy.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:53:12
From people who sell to them plus whatever exchanges they're set up to trade with.  Bitstamp most likely?  (though I wouldn't be surprised if they're set up on all the major exchanges)

My personal opinion being that if *everyone* is hoarding then the bitcoin economy won't grow &amp; the whole idea will just kind of collapse on itself.  (not that everyone agrees with that, just my own stance on the subject)

@_date: 2013-11-26 23:38:33
Yes, that's what most people do.  e.g. if you're in the U.S. you can easily transfer BTC to Coinbase, CampBX, etc., sell your BTC for USD &amp; do an ACH transfer to your U.S. checking account.  You just have to go through the process of getting yourself set up on those other services.
There are other ways to sell BTC of course.

No idea on your setup, but I'm assuming you're going to attempt to GPU mine?  Check out [cgminer] ( the readme txt files in there should give you enough of an overview to start off.  (you'll want to be comfortable w/ setting things up in the command line of course).

Seems like it's legal, you'd just need to register yourself as a MSB w/ FinCEN on the federal level.  On top of that there are also money transmitter laws in your state (and/or any other states you operate in), they'll have different regulations you'd have to follow.  Assuming you do all that then yes, you're in the clear.

Hmm..  for less than .10 BTC not sure what to suggest exactly.  maybe Localbitcoins?  Most of the ones below will work better if you're trading for more than that.
For U.S. try:
* Coinbase
* bitquick.co
* Localbitcoins
* CampBX (USPS money order deposits, but they are looking to implement bank ACH deposits towards end of November)
* Coinmkt (USPS money order deposits or bank wire)
Other Exchanges:
* Bitstamp is the biggest, but you'd need to deposit via international bank wire or Ripple
* BTC-e is another one, you'd need to do international bank wire.  They have some other methods but I'm not sure which would work for U.S. users.
Other ways:
* Maybe sell stuff on bitmit for BTC?  It'd kind of like selling on Ebay, but for BTC instead of USD/Paypal.

Not a *bad* idea, but your Paypal account may get frozen before  you make it to the 180 day count, at which point they automatically refund all your pending transactions (not sure what exactly they do for the ones that weren't pending).

A large amount of U.S. offices have been closed for the Thanksgiving holiday since Thursday.  Kraken's offices are in the U.S. so it's not a wild assumption they too may be closed.
So when you say "5 days" what you're really saying is that you've given them 1 business day, or really less than 1 business day, to get back to you.
Of course, I don't work at Kraken so I'm only surmising what their office schedule is.  (but believe me, *tons* of U.S. offices have been closed since Thursday)

Technically your bitcoin addresses will always be in the bitcoin blockchain.  But if you never backed up the wallet.dat file, or at least backed up your wallet's private keys, then you have no way of ever recovering whatever you had before.

In general you should be avoiding Gox.  Plus, since you're willing to do international wire transfer deposits to Gox you really should just sign up to Bitstamp instead, they're close to the same [trade volume anyway] (  Though now that I think about it, it won't be feasible to do a international wire transfer for $30 worth, not sure why you're trying to get into Gox..
You have other options if you're in the U.S.  If you're *just* buying $30 worth you should be looking at Coinbase, Localbitcoins, or bitquick, IMO.
 * [Coinbase] ( - Just link your checking account for ACH deposits/withdrawals
 * [Localbitcoins] ( - Cash  purchases or bank deposits
 * [bitquick] ( - Bank deposits to buy BTC
 * [Bitstamp] ( - If you need to buy w/ USD you'll need to do international bank wire transfer deposit first
 * [CampBX] ( - Mail in a USPS money order to deposit USD (though they are implementing ACH deposits towards the end of the month)
 * [Coinmkt] ( - Mail in USPS money order to deposit USD, or do a domestic bank wire transfer (the exchange is still pretty small so you may be better off with the other options)
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:42:41
That doesn't sound like it'd work, processing a money order means they'd have to clear the whole amount at one time.  Not sure what they do when they receive deposits for greater than the account was set up for, you'd better ask CampBX and/or verify your account.
Though for the record I've deposited smaller amounts w/ them using money orders with no issues.

Exit out of bitcoin-qt (just make sure it's not running).  Then download the current version &amp; install it over the version currently on your computer.
Not in front of a Mac at the moment so I can't give you a real step-by-step, but it should work the same way with any other program you install updates to.
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:23:43
No idea.  My guess is that since they have lower volume vs the other exchanges it wouldn't be in their interest to have low volume *and* high fees.
@_date: 2013-10-16 23:19:36

@_date: 2013-09-04 05:34:18
Probably Coinbase &amp; Campbx?  Campbx has been pretty reliable for me ;)
Not sure how viable Bitstamp is for U.S. residents?  You'd basically have to wire USD in/out of Bitstamp, so it would only work if you're a high volume seller.  For the rest of us, those wire fees are going to add up fast.  (I think you can also use Ripple to deposit USD into Bitstamp, not really sure how that works or if it's better/worse than wiring funds)
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:13:30
Nope, sorry.  Paypal has already frozen my account a few times before for non-Bitcoin issues, so I rarely touch anything Paypal nowadays.  (fun fact: Paypal doesn't like virtual credit cards either)

@_date: 2013-12-26 05:47:36
Sorry, not sure.  Just giving you the options, I'd never deal with CC for bitcoin/litecoin personally, the fees are crazy high.

@_date: 2013-11-05 01:26:46


No.  Way too risky, too many Paypal scammers &amp; Paypal themselves may cancel/freeze the associated accounts for selling virtual currencies.
Now technically, maybe  ?  They do put a 60-day hold on Paypal orders so it's not necessarily what you'd want.  OTOH they're only doing that b/c of the 60-day window for Paypal to reverse the transaction, so really they're trying to filter out the scammers.

Aren't you in the U.S.?  (I'm just assuming b/c you are currently using Coinbase)  I wasn't aware that there *is* a good reason to use MtGox if you're in the U.S.
USD Deposits: You're going to need to go to your bank &amp; set up an international wire transfer that your bank may/may not do for you.  Will cost about $15 fee, $75 minimum transfer, plus whatever your bank will charge you.
USD Withdrawals: Not possible to any bank in the U.S.  (though if you wait 6+ months then maybe, but I wouldn't bet on it)
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:25:23


What country are you in?  I think people outside the U.S. usually end up using OKPay or SEPA transfer.
You're a bit screwed if you're in the U.S., really the only way is with an expensive international wire transfer that your bank may/may not refuse.  (U.S. banks don't always honor wire transfers to/from BTC-E)
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:38:10
At Bistamp you could
 * Buy more bitcoin
 * Withdraw via International wire transfer
 * Withdraw via SEPA transfer
 * Withdraw via Ripple (I think? I don't know much how that works)
(it's on the [homepage] (
I suspect you can do international wire transfers in South Africa so that would be the way to do it?  Maybe SEPA, but I'm not familiar enough with South African banks to know for sure.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:31:44
I believe you'd need to do international bank wire transfers, so it would only be worth it for amounts larger than $100, or probably more,  IMO.  You'd need to check with your bank re: fees.
Bitstamp does also accept Ripple deposits/withdrawals, but I don't think there are any Ripple gateways where you can deposit USD to send Ripple to Bitstamp, at least not in the U.S.  (I think you used to be able to do this with SnapSwap until the Dwolla fiasco).

Do you have any software set up to remote into your computer?  e.g. VNC, Remote Desktop, etc.?  And/or any firewalls set up on the network or computer itself?  Outside of that, maybe you had accessed your Coinbase account from a computer infected w/ a trojan horse.  (you probably know every computer/phone that you've accessed Coinbase on so it'd be fairly straightforward to narrow down the culprits)
Hackers don't just magically gain access to people's computers, there has to be a weak link somewhere, you'll want to spend some time figuring it out.  Of course, Coinbase can tell you if your account was accessed from your home IP address or somewhere else.
The other possibility is that maybe Coinbase's 2FA implementation is broken somewhere (aside from leaving the browser logged in).  e.g. someone found a backdoor into their website.  That would be bad news :/

In general to play it safe with Coinbase
 * Don't save your user/password on any web browsers
 * Don't save your 2FA code on any web browsers
 * Do save a 2FA code with Google Authenticator or Authy, in case you can't get the texts from Coinbase to log in

Yes &amp; no.  For bitcoin deposits you do not need to be verified.  But, for bitcoin withdrawals yes you do need to be verified.
Search around here in you'll find plenty of people that accidentally deposited bitcoin into MtGox before realizing they couldn't withdraw any of it until they go through verification.

I had that problem, fixed it by exiting both programs &amp; then starting bitcoin-qt with the -rescan option.  You already tried that option?
The other option is to try clearing out Armory's program settings &amp; letting it start from scratch.  (obviously back up the files first, particularly the .wallet files!)  It's possible one of the Armory files was corrupted.  I don't know which one but the blkfiles.txt and/or mempool.bin files may be suspect.
(this is based on running Armory in Windows 64-bit, though it's probably the same process on Linux)

Did you think this through?
You don't actually think a bank would allow $100k worth of debit card transactions to go through without incident?  They have limits on ATM &amp; debit withdrawals, you would for sure get a debit card decline &amp; a phone call after a certain amount, way way before you hit $100k.
Not to mention how you'd go about buying $100k worth of moneypaks without raising suspicion.
Perhaps if you did it over a span of a few months or a year, but you'd have a hard time saying your bank account was hijacked a few months ago/a year ago without you noticing.

It'd be tough, probably impossible.  In theory you could attempt to firewall it in the way technology has developed to block/slow down Bittorrent (aside from blocking port 8333 which wouldn't work anyway).  But for that to really be successful you'd need every country *and* every ISP to coordinate efforts to do this.  Something like that just isn't possible now or even in the near/far future.
And even if that happened.. well then the network could simply run hidden on alternate networks, e.g. something like Tor.

You should fix the title of your post.  The link you posted is complaining about issues when attempting to convert $50k fiat to BTC quickly.  And yes, I kind of agree it may not be so simple converting large amounts of USD to BTC quickly (aside from doing a bunch of consecutive transfers/buys on CampBX or similar).
But your post doesn't refer to money transfer with BTC at all.  You never even had $50k worth of BTC to attempt to transfer.
Correct me if I'm wrong though, did you in fact have $50k worth of BTC &amp; had issues sending that to someone?

As long as it's being reflected on the official donation page of the organization that's basically all you need as far as legitimacy.
Could be as simple as listing a bitcoin address there for people to send BTC donations too.  Then for your own donation drive(s) just use the same bitcoin address (which could be verified by seeing the same address on the organization's website).
Slightly more fancy would be using a Coinbase or Bitpay button if you stick to sending people to the website directly.

Sure it's valid, but it's also something of a necessity if you want to buy any BTC online.
That said, why not just open up a separate checking account for your online stuff?  Personally I have two bank accounts, my 2nd/spare checking account is the one that gets connected to whatever websites I need, including things relating to bitcoin.  I only keep whatever minimum amount of $ I need in that account so it cuts down on a lot of risk IMO.

You literally just need those two numbers to get started on Coinbase, or any other website that connects to a bank account.

MtGox technically says you *can*, but I dunno, people have been waiting 6+ months without a withdrawal so in practical terms USD withdrawal to the U.S. does not exist.
You can blame the U.S. government for that one, ever since all their U.S. funds were seized MtGox hasn't had any reliable banking partners in the U.S.  I'm guessing you're just catching up to all this, here's some reading to get you started, you can Google around for more on that ;)

When you do your taxes you can claim gambling wins/losses if you wanted.  I doubt it'd be any different from, say, going to Vegas.

Or if you lost a massive amount &amp; are trying to write them off somehow (but I think you can only write off gambling losses up to the amount you also won during the same tax period.. e.g. if you lost $10k, but made $20k, you could try paying taxes only on $10k of the winnings).

Verification worked for me, but doesn't seem to work for everyone..  
I kind of wonder if they have something weird set up with their CC AVS system (address verification).  Usually these systems only check the first numbers in the street address &amp; the zip code.  But sometimes they're set up weird &amp; also check for the zip+4 code.  Not saying this would work for you, but in addition to your billing address try entering the zip+4 code instead of the normal 5-digit code.
e.g. if your full zip is 10001-1234 then on Coinbase enter 100011234 as the zip.
I'd be curious if that helps at all, though it's kind of a long-shot.  Really, Coinbase would be the ones that know how their AVS system is set up.

Ugh, that happens to me b/c of Lastpass + Chrome.  Is your Firefox trying to autofill the login textboxes?
The BTC-E site is set up in a way that apps that autofill the E-Mail/Password boxes can't get to the OTP textbox that is hidden behind the E-Mail/Password boxes.  e.g. So with Lastpass, if I let it autofill the E-Mail/Password &amp; then attempt to log in I get the same "Invalid one-time password" issue.
The solution?  Manually enter the E-Mail.  Then manually enter the password, or copy/paste it from Lastpass.  *Then* attempt to log in.  Doing it that way the BTC-E site will reveal the OTP textbox.

CampBX is planning to add ACH deposits sometime this week or next, so that might be worth keeping an eye on.

This is true, it could just be part of his con (pretending he was hacked to withdraw 50 btc).  While that's always a possibility I'm thinking he's being honest about what happened.
If the hack happened the way he described, most likely someone physically or remotely accessed a browser he previously logged into.  Said browser may have had saved 2FA auth for 30 days, thus getting around the login 2FA.  Required 2FA re-authentication on withdrawals *would* have prevented this attack vector.
Of course that's just one scenario, eh who knows exactly what happened?  I do wish he explained a bit further, there's only so many computers/phones that you'd access your Coinbase account from so you'd think you can narrow it down a bit further from there.

Realistically you would not have been able to cash out of MtGox anyway (unless you're in Japan) so worst case you would have ended up sending the BTC back to yourself.  I've never understood why people outside of Japan bother sending anything to MtGox.

To be fair, no one said that Mozilla needs to start accepting *anonymous* donations.
Your are correct in that many tax-exempt organizations would need to report their donations, this is why they generally ask for the donator's name/address.  Accepting bitcoin, or CC, or Paypal, etc. has nothing to do with that, the organization would still ask for a donator's name/address regardless.  Of course that means it's not as simple as throwing up a QR code / bitcoin address up on your website since you'd need to capture additional information.  e.g. it'd be similar to how the [EFF accepts bitcoin donations] (

Are you old enough to make your own decisions?
There are lots of us on that use them w/o any problems.  There is also a loud contingent of users here that have had problems with them.  Nothing is hack-proof, if you're looking for someone to tell you *that*, sorry man.
The company itself is legit, but could use some beefing up of their security.  While their security is actually better than a lot of banks' own websites, I'd suggest:
 * Don't do the instant checking account verification, let it go old school &amp; do the two deposits that you'll check on in a few days.
 * Don't save your user/password on any web browsers
 * Don't save your 2FA on any web browsers
So far every time I've read about someone's Coinbase account being compromised it was b/c of one of those 3 things.  Practice safe computing &amp; you'll be fine.


Those are standard ACH deposits/withdrawals, very common in the U.S.  You just need a bank account number &amp; routing number to get that going.  You've ever transferred $$ from one U.S. bank account to another?  You ever get direct deposit from work?  Same system.
ALSO: If you're *really* paranoid, set up a separate checking account for Coinbase and/or any other websites that you need to connect to a bank account.  That's what I do, even if my Coinbase was hacked I wouldn't lose all that much $$ ;)

It's been a continuing subject on people are *always* posting asking how to withdraw fiat from MtGox and/or why MtGox isn't wiring their withdrawal after 6+ months.  You seem to be new to Reddit so I'll assume you just have seen all the posts asking about this subject.
When you're withdrawing you're doing it in EUR, correct?  Are your withdraws small-ish amounts, or fairly big?  e.g. over 730 EUR at a time?  Also, are these SEPA withdrawals or international wire transfers?
Sorry for the questions, genuinely curious.  You seem to be the the only person on that has mentioned no problems withdrawing fiat from MtGox so it's notable.  You could literally start your own Reddit thread on the topic if you wanted, you'd certainly get a lot of replies.

Well, to be fair, no one really knows who owns CampBX either but I haven't had any problems with them.  (&amp; they're in the U.S.)
BTC-E, I would maybe use if I could figure out an easy way to actually get fiat there.  (aside from sending BTC)
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:43:48
What?  You're overthinking it. Assuming you're sending 1 BTC (valued at $750), you only sent &amp; only lost 1 BTC.  What the recipient decides to do with that 1 BTC is up to them, for all you know the value may go down immediately after he/she receives it (or, go up).
BTC-E technically has all sorts of fees for withdrawing to fiat (assuming this person is indeed able to withdraw, that alone is no small task there).
I'm also not sure how this would apply if the recipient was simply receiving to his/her wallet e.g. bitcoin-qt, Armory, Blockchain (to transfer to BTC-E later), would you still consider that a loss?  What if they didn't tell you they only cash out via BTC-E?
I suppose you could make the same argument if you were to send BTC to someone in Japan, &amp; they insist on receiving at their Gox account.  In the end, you should be looking at it as sending BTC to someone, otherwise just send via a wire transfer/Paypal/Google Wallet/etc if you're trying to send them fiat.

So, not any different from loaning cash to someone.
In reality there's nothing stopping a bank/credit organization from loaning bitcoin to someone (though I'm sure the interest rate scheme would be.. different).

You're talking about arbitrage.  Like you already discovered it's very difficult getting USD in/out of MtGox, in fact getting USD out is almost impossible.  Thus it's not so easy to pull off what you're talking about.
Because of that difficulty something like MtGox is really only usable by users in Japan (they can withdraw JPY out of MtGox much easier than we can withdraw USD), so I'm sure there are users in Japan set up to do arbitrage between MtGox &amp; other exchanges like you said.  But for someone in the U.S. MtGox is basically a no-go.

I'm hardly an expert so perhaps I'm mistaken, but it does seem like Ripple is being positioned to be something like a modern money transfer/exchange service.
The idea of "gateways" that can handle different currencies &amp; convert the currency you send them on the fly is an interesting one.  Not clear why you couldn't do the same with bitcoin, but maybe Ripple just has more marketing $$ to pull it off?  I wonder if in the long term these Ripple "gateways" will always accept bitcoin too, so the side effect is that the Ripple Gateways end up helping users convert between bitcoin &amp; fiat more easily?  Who knows.  Right now the gateways are barely functional, the one the U.S. (SnapSwap) can't even deposit/withdraw USD ever since Dwolla cut off ties.  Instead you have to go outside the Ripple network to exchange for XRP with, you guessed it, bitcoin.
From trying to use it it doesn't seem like it's easier than bitcoin, in fact it's way more complicated.  I can't even "activate" my Ripple account without getting some XRP first, &amp; since I can't directly buy XRP the whole thing feels like just another altcoin that you trade BTC with.
And that's not even getting into IOUs, granting "trust" to certain users/exchanges(?), the whole centralization aspect, etc.

re: Localbitcoins, sounds like you gave up way too easily.
There are other ways to buy bitcoin, but I can't think of any you'll rule out for one reason or another.  You don't want to do cash transactions in person or at a bank, you don't want to link your bank account to anything, &amp; you don't want to verify anywhere.

Try selling through Coinbase (ACH deposit to your bank), CampBX (ACH deposit to your bank), Localbitcoins (face-to-face cash transactions).
Or if it's a larger amount it might make sense to sell on Bitstamp &amp; then do an international wire transfer to your bank. (though the other options are easier if you're in the U.S.)
@_date: 2013-08-23 13:25:00
The quick answer is NO.
I do deal w/ chargebacks at my job from time to time, &amp; yes you can contest a chargeback.  The CC company mails/faxes you a form to fill out, it becomes a long annoying process of mailing/faxing forms back &amp; forth.
Most chargebacks are innocent "Oh, I forgot I actually did buy that from your store, sorry!"  The other certain %, well those you just end up having to write off at the end of the year.  How much you can afford to lose depends on how much you made to cover those losses.  Luckily most customers are honest but maybe that depends on the product you're selling.
The thing is the CC customer can reply to your contesting of the chargeback &amp; say you basically lied, have it wrong, etc.  CC merchants *always* side w/ their CC customer if they persist through the chargeback process.
All your extra evidence wouldn't mean anything.  Remember, the security code on the back of a CC is already an attempt at making sure a charge is legit (as well as signing receipts &amp; all that jazz), but even that won't prevent a chargeback.  Besides claiming fraud a customer could simply say whatever you sold them didn't meet expectations, maybe you sold them "broken" bitcoin (hah).  Companies do their due diligence but it doesn't really matter, there'll always be that % of dishonest persons that'll always do a chargeback.  Hell, you can even do a chargeback on Newegg if you really wanted.  (though funny enough Newegg will respond w/ a permaban on ever shipping goods to your addresses)
Why do you think some small businesses don't even bother trying to accept CC?  It's not always b/c of the fees.
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:43:32
Maybe I'm misunderstanding, aren't you basically sending BTC to another bitcoin address that just happens to be the same as your alt-coin address?  Otherwise the transaction would have been rejected if the bitcoin address was not valid.
So the result would be the same as whatever happens when you accidently send BTC to a valid bitcoin address that you don't own.
EDIT: Thinking about this more, it'd really have to be quite a typo.  e.g. While bitcoin &amp; litecoin addresses are identical, litecoin starts w/ L while bitcoin starts with 1 or 3.  Not sure on the other altcoins.

Armory relies on bitcoin-qt to function correctly.  Try shutting down both Armory &amp; Bitcoin-QT, then launch bitcoin-qt with the -rescan option.  Wait for Bitcoin-QT to finish launching, then launch Armory &amp; see if that helped.
If that doesn't work, you might want to try clearing out some of the files in the %appdata%\armory folder &amp; see if that helps.  I don't know which files exactly, I think the mempool.bin &amp; blkfiles.txt?  Or just clear out the whole folder (leave your .wallet files) &amp; see how Armory starts up.
Obviously backup your .wallet files before doing any of that.

I'm curious about the 2FA too, that should have stopped any unauthorized access to the Coinbase account?  If the account had 2FA set up I can only think of two things:
1. Someone physically or via internet hacked into any machine that was logged into the Coinbase account recently.  e.g. if you log into Coinbase, enter your 2FA code, &amp; click the checkbox "Don't ask me for the code again for 30 days when I use this computer." then that browser won't ask for 2FA again.
2. Unlikely, but maybe the 2FA codes were being backed up on the same computer, or another computer, somewhere.  (presumably then the computer was hacked &amp; the 2FA backups were accessed).  With that it'd be trivial to load the 2FA key onto a separate desktop/phone app &amp; generate new codes to log into Coinbase.

No.  The problem w/ CCs is that it is *very* easy to do chargebacks on just about anything which leaves the BTC seller without their BTC or their money.  Because of this most sellers won't accept CCs as a payment method, &amp; the ones that do will charge high fees to cover for the scammers doing chargebacks later.
Same thing with Paypal, very easy to reverse charges, e.g. [this] (
Basically, you're expecting strangers that don't know you to trust that you won't do a chargeback.  Why should anyone trust you?
re: Google Wallet, yeah would have the same issue if you're using a CC.  In theory might be OK if you're strictly using ACH transfers from your bank account into Google Wallet?  I'm not sure on the answer to that one.  (Square Cash would be another one that in theory could work?)

Deposits: Only money orders via mail &amp; wire transfers.
Withdrawals: Only money orders via mail, &amp; wire transfers.
They *did* have Dwolla support for both, but we know what happened with that.
For what it's worth, they seem to be working on adding ACH deposits/withdrawals but who knows when that'll happen.
Summary: Coinmkt's options are actually a bit worse than CampBX's at the moment.  At least CampBX gives you the option of ACH withdrawal for a $2 fee, &amp; personal check deposits (both of those options only available if you're verified @ CampBX first).

Coinbase has their own price, they're kind of a bitcoin "store".  The exchanges also have their own prices but will go up/down w/the market. (Coinbase kind of does this too but they use their own algorithm)
re: Coinbase, if you have a U.S. checking out you can just link it up there &amp; should be all set.  Your first buys will be slow-ish, there's some verification you'd need to do to get going (when you register there you'll see all this info).

It would be better if Payza could just cut you a check or something, since they don't really want you on the service anymore.

e.g. you may as well assume your email/web communications is readable, no matter what endpoints you're using.  HTTPS, secured SMTP, hell you may as well send emails/IMs through Tor but it won't matter since your webmail/IM endpoints are compromised.
But if you're properly encrypting those communications, e.g. strong PGP encrypted emails/IMs/etc, then none of your leaked data will actually be readable.  Of course if this was the NSA, &amp; you're a high value target, it'd be easier for them to try to obtain your PGP key somehow.

They told me they can't cancel the pending bank transfer, &amp; also clarified that we can't send money to CampBX as of October 15th.  So basically a complete non-answer.
Seems like I'll have to wait 'till the 15th, then initiate a withdrawal back to my bank account.  ARGH!
But at least they don't charge for incoming/outgoing ACH?  Seems like they're losing $$ by letting it go in &amp; out, but whatever.  I'm just annoyed my money is going to be in limbo for at least 7-10 days &amp; Dwolla won't do anything about it.

Move to Japan, get a residency card, open a bank account in Japan.  Profit!  (if you're already in Japan this part is easy)
Otherwise, there is no way to "capitalize" on the price difference between Gox &amp; other exchanges.  Just search for Gox &amp; withdrawing USD/EUR/whatever, you'll see what I mean.
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:50:34
How long have you waited?  My last email to them took 10 days for a response...  I never said they were fast :)
re: your $$, it's an ACH transfer so it'll be back in your account 3-5 business days, maybe sooner if you're lucky.  That's just how the U.S. banking system works, not much anyone can do about that  (I'm making an assumption that you haven't already been waiting 3-5 business days, I may be mistaken)
@_date: 2013-09-29 21:14:04


Yes.  Buy bitcoins in Gox, then transfer those out to Coinbase, then sell the bitcoins on Coinbase &amp; you'll have your USD.
It's an easy solution but it's not what you want.  Don't know what to tell you, this has been discussed to death already.

Give up on the Paypal method, it won't be possible.
If Localbitcoins doesn't work you might want to look at doing international wire transfers into Bitstamp &amp; buy/sell bitcoin through there?
Outside of that, not sure if there are any BTC exchanges/services specifically in Brazil.

Did you ask your CC company about this?  They probably declined it b/c they thought the Coinbase charge was fraudulent or something.  If that is the case, even if you change the CC number your CC company will just go &amp; decline the charge again.  Then Coinbase will remove your instant buy again, etc etc.
You could always try a different VISA CC from a different issuer if you have one (or, just sign up for another VISA CC &amp; use that w/ Coinbase).
source: I unfortunately deal w/ web orders at my day job, December is a fun time of dealing with tons of customers who had CC declines even though their balance is fine.  Good times! ;)

Once it's limited you're pretty screwed.  You'll have to wait, &amp; after/during the waiting period they *will* ask you for all sorts of additional legal docs before they release your funds.  Last it happened to me I think they wanted driver's license, utility bills, valid phone number, social security number, among other things.
Assuming you made them happy w/ the additional docs they might decide to release your funds in 180 days.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:59:17
The exchanges all have different liquidity.  But yes, in theory if you think you can quickly deposit &amp; cash out of those exchanges quickly then you can make some bank..  unfortunately not as easy as you're making it sound ;)
e.g. w/ Gox you can't even withdraw funds unless you're in Japan w/ a Japanese bank.
@_date: 2013-12-22 15:27:26
Wouldn't that be a redeemable code, basically?  Most of the exchanges looking to comply w/ U.S. regulations discontinued all those (  Not sure on China's stance on those, maybe it's possible there.
Even if selling those codes was possible I doubt they'd want to be in the business of physically producing those things to market into retail stores.

Coinbase only works with U.S. bank accounts (usually checking accounts), it's not going to work if you only have debit/credit card.
Try  or  just be prepared for the high fees.
In general it's not a good idea to buy bitcoin with credit/debit/paypal.
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:39:22
Why shouldn't they?  Someone has to be pretty crazy just to even attempt to accept Paypal for bitcoin.  Plus Paypal gives someone [60 days] ( to dispute a transaction, so I'm guessing they wait out the dispute period before assuming the Paypal transaction is legit.  Interesting idea.. but yeah, stay away from Paypal.

As of October 15th CampBX can't accept $$ through Dwolla, so really that's the date that Dwolla becomes truly useless.

Reddit only has 5 main rules &amp; you still managed to break one.  Kudos?  
re: your question, those bitcoins aren't coming from Coinbase.  Transactions coming from Coinbase themselves would say "You received bitcoin from Coinbase".  e.g. 
So basically, someone outside of Coinbase is sending bitcoin to a random bitcoin address that happens to be one of your Coinbase wallet's bitcoin addresses.  There's not much Coinbase themselves can do about that, though I guess they could remove that particular bitcoin address from your wallet so you don't keep receiving the random bitcoin deposits from whoever, though I guess then Coinbase themselves get to pocket these "donations" ;)
@_date: 2013-12-31 13:34:02
That's strange.  You haven't seen any checkboxes to confirm you're not using OKPay for crypto-currency transactions?  e.g.
That's just what I heard, I'm in the U.S. can't use OKPay (though I take it you're outside the U.S. so OKPay should be usable for you, assuming they're now OK with being used for crypto-currency transactions)
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:30:20
Seems pretty risky.  Paypal has a habit of freezing both the seller &amp; buyer accounts if they deem the transaction "unsafe".  Not saying they always do that, but it's happened to me twice in the past so I can attest it *does* happen.  (though for my part, those two instances didn't even have anything to do with bitcoin)
But still, good luck!  Maybe you're better off trying to sell BTC for Moneypak?  Assuming the moneypak is legit it can be loaded into your Paypal if you're just going to use the funds for an actual Paypal purchase.  Not sure if that's what you want for paying hosting, but it's an idea.
Also agree w/ Cowboy_Coder, just move your hosting to Namecheap!  They're a pretty great hosting company *and* accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-10 01:44:11
Eh, I'd rather they just went away.  Could you imagine Paypal limiting your account for 6+ months &amp; freezing your btc assets in there?  They already do it with USD.
Better if websites use their own checkout + btc options.  Or 3rd parties that support btc e.g. Coinbase.  Even Google Checkout &amp; Amazon Payments would be better options vs Paypal (even more so if they supported btc!).

Thinking about it a bit, if the rate bothers you why not just conduct the trade at BTC-E rates?  You may as well since the recipient is insisting on receiving at BTC-E anyway.  Did he/she insist on the trade being at Coinbase/Bitstamp rates?
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:14:07
This gets asked a lot..
In short: Different exchanges have different liquidity.  You may think you can buy low at Bitstamp &amp; sell high at MtGox, but how do you plan to withdraw your USD/EUR?  You simply can't.  (of course, if you're in Japan then the story is different, go do some arbitrage!)
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:53:27
You've got to make it to level 2 verified *plus* have a backup CC on file for instant purchases.  e.g. in your specific case that means 30 days after your 3rd purchase (which was successful).
Yes, it's kind of a pain.. e.g. on my end of things, b/c my first order was flagged as "high risk" that 30-day countdown to level 2 didn't even start until my subsequent successful purchase.  So really, I ended up waiting like 40 days to make it to level 2 verification.  My account is fine now, but it's something to keep in mind if your initial purchases get flagged for "high risk".

Seems easier to buy some btc quickly on Localbitcoins if you just need some quickly for whatever reason (assuming funds are available).  Or Coinbase if you're already verified there.
Your idea has high potential to shut down your CampBX *and* Dwolla accounts for "lending" your account info out to third parties.  Plus I'm not sure if the trust level is there, to trust that your CampBX account isn't already locked up for some other reason.
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:25:17
You mentioned the NSA/SEC/IRS, so I'm assuming this is "how to stop bitcoin in the U.S."
 1. Laws have to be passed to make all crytpo currencies illegal.  (technically this may also make in-game currencies illegal, e.g. those famous Linden dollars)
 2. ISPs would need to be coerced into actively censoring the internet, specifically bitcoin traffic.
 3. Actively enforce &amp; prosecute anyone violating  or   In the name of "national security", or "we must protect our children from CP!", whatever bogeyman the govt needs to use.
no. 1 might be enough to decimate the Bitcoin economy in the U.S. (not the rest of the world)  People would still find ways to buy BTC, only there won't really be any "legal" ways to spend BTC in the U.S.  And with the threat of enforcement/prosecution it won't be possible to buy/sell BTC in the open.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:47:45
Best to avoid credit card/paypal for BTC transactions.  Especially Paypal, crypto transactions are against their TOS &amp; they *will* cancel the order &amp; freeze accounts if they find you doing it.  (that's not even counting the Paypal scammers that dispute the transaction after receiving their bitcoin)
Try  or  ?  Just be prepared for the larger fees since they have to deal w/ credit fraud.

No particular timing, but it does depend on two factors:
- If I need the coins *now* then will just buy them at whatever price &amp; leave it at that.
- If I don't need them right this second I'll just deposit the $$ into my exchange &amp; set up limit orders for amounts slightly lower than the current bitcoin price.

It's a risky proposition, but you *can* pursue a wire transfer deposit if you really wanted.

Localbitcoins is not U.S. only.

I don't think that's how bank ACH works.. you generally need to have that amount in the beginning of the transfer period.  It sounds weird, but I've had a few times when the deposit into my bank account cleared 1 *day* after an ACH transfer was initiated &amp; the entire ACH failed later on.  Not sure why this is, must be how the banks have the ACH system set up.
re: your issue, just email Coinbase, tell them  to attempt to re-withdraw from your account now.  (&amp; leave that amount in your account, of course)  You're probably going to have to wait at least a few days for Coinbase to get back to you.

Hard to give you any real suggestions otherwise, though you can at least check out Localbitcoins should work for you just about anywhere in the world (assuming there are sellers in your area).
Also, most sellers won't accept Paypal/credit cards for bitcoins b/c those are reversible payment methods.  In fact Paypal outright cancels any orders connected to bitcoin so that'd be a bad idea all around.
If you *really* need to use a credit card try  just be prepared for the extra fee.

?  If you're not ever going to withdraw fiat or bitcoin then you don't need to verify on MtGox.  Otherwise if you plan on ever withdrawing *anything* then plan on getting verified, it's the only way.
I'm assuming you're talking strictly withdrawing bitcoin.  If you're in the U.S. you won't be able to withdraw USD from MtGox, but that shouldn't affect you since you're just looking at withdrawing bitcoin.

Agreed.  I also do light stock trading on one of the online brokerages &amp; all those trades get reported to the IRS, so for U.S. users it makes sense that at some point this stuff will get automatically sync'd during tax time.  I have a feeling that the exchanges trying to stick to strict compliance guidelines would be the first to do this (e.g. Coinmkt).

It would be a Japanese Domestic Transfer.  I don't know anyone in Japan who has done it, but supposedly those go much quicker now that MtGox is set up with a new banking partner for those:
So, it might be feasible if you know someone in Japan with a bank account they can lend you?  Presumably said person can also do a international wire transfer out of their bank account to the U.S.
(You're not going to actually be able to open your own bank account in Japan unless you have a residency card there.)

Ah you're right, the first Dwolla deposit has a 31 day verification.  (I just deposited w/ money orders during that time)  After the initial 31 days it's smooth sailing w/ Dwolla deposits.

From the [MtGox site] (
*Documents required for verification:*
 * *A valid copy of a government issued photo ID and:*
 * *Proof of residence (less than 6 months old) - this can be a utility or phone bill.*
In the U.S. most married individuals will have a government issued photo ID &amp; a cell phone (granted, not sure on other countries).
Though I guess your argument is that most married people are on shared cell phone plans under one person?  I don't buy that, but if that were the case it'd be an easy fix since most married people have a *ton* of utility bills, just temporarily change the name on one of them (or spread out which bill is under whose name).  I'd argue this is *easier* for a married couple to figure out vs college student without bills &amp; having his/her parent pay for everything. (I'm assuming this is OP's case)

Lets try this again:
In short, yes I think(?) you can add an international bank as a withdraw method, it would end up being a international wire transfer.  *But* it will take a very long time for you to get your withdrawal.
You really should consider purchasing BTC &amp; transferring that out of Gox, especially if you were planning on having those funds within the next 1-2 months.

To be fair, this thread is about customers in the US trying to use bitcoin exchanges.  Unless Kraken's FAQ is wrong it would seem the only deposit option they support are wire transfers for US customers. (feel free to correct if I'm mistaken as I don't have an account with them)
Depositing funds to Kraken might be much easier for you since you're in the EU &amp; can do free SEPA deposits (I'm assuming).  Wire transfers are a bit of a headache for US customers (have to go to the bank, or email/fax a bunch of forms, &amp; then the bank may not even approve the transfer if they feel like it)

Not when the difficulty goes up:
Just saying.. I have 10 of them mining away as kind of a fun little side project, but these things won't ever pay for themselves. ;)
I personally just use public [P2Pool nodes] ( which if you wanted you could pick one &amp; set it up as a backup pool.
To add any backup pools, you just add more to your command line for bfgminer.  e.g. you'd have something like this:
-o pool_1_ip:pool_1_port -O pool1user:poolpw -o pool_2_ip:pool_2_port -O pool2user:poolpw -o pool_3_ip:pool_3_port -O pool3user:poolpw


With a USB Erupter your return is always going to be about the same I think(?), main thing is to mine in a pool &amp; that should give you some sort of return.

Not much you can do, if he doesn't want to pursue it then move on (maybe in the future?  Or his competitors will end up accepting bitcoin before he does?).
If he's a merchant accepting CC he *definitely* deals with more fraud involving CC.  Likely he just doesn't feel like dealing with setting up another payment method.

Here's a fun example: 
There are others of course, feel free to search around.  Paying via Paypal is definitely not recommended.  (or CC for that matter, due to the same reason: chargebacks)
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:56:06
Correct.  Unfortunately I haven't read of a fix for this one :/
Best you can do is call your CC &amp; verify the billing address on file.  Keep in mind that the billing address is *not* the same as the mailing address on the account, so it's always possible the CC company has something different for whatever reason.
But if the CC company has the correct billing info then you might have to wait until Coinbase has a fix..  Or, for kicks you could try getting another VISA CC &amp; see if that works out?  Worst case, just close the VISA account if it turns out you can't use it.
(the CC verification worked fine for me, if that matters.. but obvs it's not working for everyone!)

Everyone in keeps saying it, but it seems like you're not quite understanding.
 * If a buyer is paying via Paypal they have 45-60 days to dispute a transaction.  It doesn't really matter what reason is give to Paypal, simply saying the bitcoin wasn't delivered would be enough to reverse a Paypal transaction.
 * If the seller has already sent the buyer bitcoin, &amp; the buyer opens a dispute during those 45-60 days, then the seller loses both the $$ &amp; bitcoin. (&amp; probably their Paypal account on top of that)
 * Paypal does *not* accept proof of delivery for bitcoin transactions b/c they do *not* support their platform to be used for trading bitcoin or other virtual currencies.  Therefore sellers via Paypal have no way of proving a bitcoin transaction was sent, this always leads to the Paypal transaction being reversed.  You mentioned transaction ID, but no, Paypal does not accept that or anything else related to bitcoin as proof of delivery.
I'm not defending this guy, but it's obvs you're confused about Paypal's policy towards bitcoin.
Maybe this read will help?

It's doable, just be cautious:
1. Absolutely encrypt your wallet.dat with a unique strong passphrase (if you're using bitcoin-qt)
2. If you're using another program to run backups absolutely add a strong password/passphrase to it, obviously something not identical to your wallet.dat file.
You're going to be putting some faith in an online service e.g. Carbonite, so be careful with your accounts on those types of services.  I don't know if Carbonite, etc. do 2FA but if they do, definitely enable it.

Personally I'm over Dwolla, if I'm going to send fiat I'd just stick w/ Square Cash or Google Wallet.  (Square's method doesn't even require an account which is infinitely better vs telling someone to sign up for a Dwolla website they've never heard of).  Maybe Dwolla will be useful for Ebay? (of course Ebay frowns on anything not-Paypal, blah)

I'm not following why'd they ask for a fee just for a deposit?  Doesn't make sense.
Maybe you just had a particularly chatty teller, usually you just go to a bank &amp; give them the slip &amp; $$ &amp; say you're just doing a deposit today.  They *usually* won't ask why you're making a deposit but if they do you could just say you're paying back some $$ owed / paying a bill (you *do* owe the seller some $$ technically).
Bank deposits are pretty normal, tons of people deposit to 3rd-party bank accounts to pay off utility bills, or just to deposit $$ for their work (retail store, bars, restaurants, etc.).
I will say BOA tellers (at least in NYC) are very pushy about trying to get you to open an account there.  Be prepared for the sales pitch ;)

If their feedback is good (&amp; it's it looks like it's from different LBC users) then you should be OK.  Someone w/ good feedback is unlikely to ruin that by running off with your cash.

You're not making sense.  Any website that links up to your bank account will verify by doing 1-2 small deposits into it.  TBH it sounds like you need to get yourself over to (esp now that you're talking about Paypal).
If your post is legit, then take a look at Localbitcoins &amp; just meet someone for a cash transaction.  (or if you're lucky you can find someone there that accepts Paypal, unlikely but who knows?)

2. Make sure your bitcoin-qt is on the latest version (0.8.5), upgrade if necessary
3. Shut down bitcoin-qt (make sure it's not running in the background either)
4. Start bitcoin-qt with the -rescan command line option, e.g.

Well, you're comparing to CampBX so I'm assuming you're in the U.S.  You *can't* withdraw USD from MtGox to a U.S. bank account, therefore your idea does not pan out.  Sure, you can sell high at MtGox but then what do you do with the USD you have stuck there?
If, however, you're talking about two exchanges outside the U.S., &amp; you yourself are based outside the U.S., then yes there is some limited arbitrage you can try.
It's all about how easily/quickly you can deposit/withdraw USD from the different exchanges.
PS - This question does get asked a lot..
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:14:39


Not with MtGox (I'm going on the assumption you're in the U.S. since you mentioned Coinbase).  MtGox has many, many issues with sending wire transfers to U.S. bank accounts so you could never realistically "cash out" of MtGox.
With Coinbase + U.S. bank account it's very easy, but you're not keeping a USD balance with them.  Every buy/sell will initiate an ACH transfer to/from your U.S. bank account.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:38:03
To be fair there are a few exchanges in the U.S., e.g. Cryptsy.
Coinbase isn't an exchange.  They're more like a bitcoin "store", &amp; there's no direct competition for that in the U.S.  Not to mention Coinbase's ease-of-use is far ahead of the U.S. exchanges.
 * Cryptsy
 * CampBX
 * Coinmkt
 * Kraken

Did your backup contain a wallet.dat file in the bitcoin folder?
That's the important one, as long as you have that you can re-install the client and re-download the blockhain if you like, then copy the old wallet.dat file into the new folder.  Or, try copying the entire bitcoin folder &amp; try starting up bitcoin &amp; see how it goes.

@_date: 2013-12-19 05:26:53
True, but I think it'll be a while before BTC value can kind of be its own independent thing vs pegged to local currency.  For the foreseeable future shoppers will continue to shop for things priced in their local currency regardless of *how* they want to pay for it.
Bitcoin has a while to go, first it needs to break out of being a niche currency/store of value/whatever you want to define it as, &amp; actually be more of a mainstream payment method.  e.g. the next "paypal", or something like that.  *If* that happens then maybe, just maybe, it can take off as a independent currency of its own?

They could just use whatever 2FA is already set up on the account &amp; *always* require it for any withdrawals.  Maybe even require it for all purchases?  Other exchanges already do this, esp. for withdrawals.
AFAIK Coinbase does not currently require 2FA for withdrawals, can someone confirm?
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:42:03


You might want to elaborate?  AFAIK it's not even possible to top up a Liqpay account with BTC.
Liqpay is all about credit cards, if you "top up" a Liqpay account that typically means charging some amount to a CC, &amp; if the charge goes through they add that to your Liqpay balance.  The Liqpay account of course is tied to a phone number.
Though for what it's worth, personally I can't use Liqpay for anything really..  I'm in the U.S. &amp; they only accept VISA/Mastercard CC from [CIS countries] ( from what I could figure out :/  (I did try for a while to get that to work from the U.S., argh)

In fact I have a hunch that this is how [this user's] (Coinbase account was hacked (assuming everything he said was true, of course).

Bitcoin transactions themselves are fast, the slowness is due to any sort of fiat conversion.


Not really.  ACH bank withdrawals aren't instant, those tend to take 2-5 business days depending on the bank.  So generally speaking, Coinbase *should* be making people wait.
When you're level 2 verified + CC, they do give you "instant" transactions.  But really, that just means they're loaning you that amount of BTC in the hopes that your ACH withdrawal doesn't fail later on (thus their 2nd requirement for a backup payment method just in case).

I just logged in there &amp; there's a grand total of *eight* BTC sell orders on the books.  About 3.8 BTC total.  A tiny bit of that is in the $740-ish range so not too bad, but the majority of the sell orders are at $800 up to $999.  Problem is without the trade volume the prices there stagnate, not sure why you'd want to pay a price premium to buy there.
But yeah, I guess assuming your USD deposit is already there &amp; credited then yes you can buy as much as you can.  Remember that we're talking about having to mail in a USPS money order so the whole thing wouldn't be same day.
You should really set up an account first, they do all sorts of ID verification before you can trade anything there (they do like to bill themselves as the exchange with the most AML compliance).

It's not.  Ebay/Paypal do not accept any sort of proof for virtual currency transactions.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:52:41


Probably not.. well, maybe they are processing by hand.  But they've already mentioned that their [current bank] ( just can't handle many USD withdrawals.  I remember someone mentioning that Gox is only limited to something like 5-10 USD wires per business day (maybe someone can confirm?), plus they probably also have limits on the amount of USD they can wire out.
This is just a guess, but I think the issue is compounded b/c of the Dwolla seizure &amp; the U.S. case against them re: operating as an unlicensed money transmitter.  Most/all banks won't want to do business with Gox until all that is settled, so they can't just sign up for an account somewhere else.  Until all that is resolved they're going to be stuck, &amp; your USD will be stuck there too.

To be fair, this could easily happen on a regular banking/credit card website, or email/etc.  You'd be surprised how many people's GMail/Yahoo accounts are cracked on a daily basis b/c users did not enable 2FA.  (seriously, just Google around, it happens quite often)
Absolutely need to enable 2FA on just about everything important.
Hopefully you can regroup &amp; buy some more bitcoins in the future.  The theft is unfortunate, but there are few options to pursue once it's done.

Had the same issue, emailed them a quick "Hey, is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening with future orders", waited 10 days, they emailed back saying they'd whitelist my account.
That should be all you need to do, though I'd be curious if anyone on the "whitelist" still gets orders canceled by Coinbase?  Sometimes I wonder if they're saying they'll whitelist an account just to get out of the customer service issue, or if they actually do have a real procedure for whitelisting..
I agree that they could be a bit more speedy w/ their customer service response.  And it *does* suck to get hit with the "high risk" cancellation, especially for new customers or people who have been using Coinbase for a while with no previous issues.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:16:04
It's possible, though I haven't gotten any emails so far.
Not clear if that means CampBX was hacked at all, or maybe partially, or maybe another bitcoin-related source was hacked for emails &amp; then those emails were filtered/targeted for anything relating to CampBX.

The questions went OK for me.  They're getting those questions from your credit history(?), other banking websites seem to get those same question/verifications from the same sources.
This won't help you w/ Coinbase, but you may want to check your credit history (I think [this] ( is the website) in case that address pops up somewhere there.
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:32:36


Not necessarily.  My first Coinbase transaction was canceled for the same reason, &amp; it was only for 1 BTC.  So I did what everyone else does &amp; emailed them, they apologized &amp; supposedly I'm "whitelisted" now.  So far all my other transactions have gone through fine, but that first one wasn't such a great experience.


.. which is why I tend to do most of my buys on CampBX.  Cheaper BTC &amp; lower fees.  The major downside is getting $$ into there, Coinbase definitely wins that one!  But overall CampBX does come out cheaper all around.

*Suppose I lose my phone and need to get those tokens again. Can I simply go to the Apple store, get a new iPhone, download GA, rescan the QR codes that I have backed up, and then be up and running?*
re: your 2nd question, the QR codes you backed up already contain the keys you need.  You can technically backup the QR barcodes or the actual keys, whichever is easier for you.
Just one thing: Don't keep the backups on your phone/computer!  Best to keep them offline somewhere, e.g. 1-2 USB sticks somewhere.  And you'll maybe want to store them in an encrypted container, e.g. a strong-passworded .zip file is fine, or Truecrypt if you're really paranoid.
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:14:49
No error or message?  That's weird.
Some people do get "Invalid bitcoin address", basically that just means to try the withdraw again later.
Or it's possible you're attempting to withdraw over your limit?  (though I think you'd get a message for that as well)

Why can't they be taxable?  The entire ledger (blockchain) is a matter of public record.  Really, the IRS/whoever would just need to know your bitcoin address(es) to see your gains/losses.
re: normal transactions, it'd probably be something similar to internet sales + state taxes, e.g. sort of voluntary, not heavily enforced.  Dunno how exactly it could be enforced, maybe if the IRS compelled businesses accepting btc to report transactions.  (though I have a feeling the U.S. would need to figure out the internet sales tax thing before ever getting to btc)
re: Trading, the larger exchanges could end up requiring your SS# to sign up for any accounts.  Then they'd helpfully mail you your tax forms every year detailing gains/losses, which are also being reported to the IRS.  Why would it have to be any different vs current trading platforms (ETrade, etc.)?
This is all U.S. speculation, not sure how it would work in other countries.
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:32:26
I was comparing to the cheaper deposit options for BTC exchange users in the U.S.  Used to be $0.25 Dwolla -&gt; CampBx, but currently that would be [$1.20-$1.60] ( money order deposit to CampBX or Coinmkt.  Admittedly not the best deposit method, luckily CampBX is planning to implement ACH deposits on November 21st which would be much better than wires or money orders.
My point, if we're going to pay wire fees anyway then why do it at Kraken?  It'd make more sense at a higher volume exchange like Bitstamp.
This question about fees won't really apply to larger volume traders of course, if you're wiring $1000+ then the fees would barely register.
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:41:49
You're already on Coinbase, just link your bank account there &amp; then buy your bitcoins right there.  Definitely the easiest way.
If you need them quicker then try localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:45:19


Coinbase, &amp; pretty much all the online exchanges, do require verification.
You should stick to cash transactions via Localbitcoins if you don't want to worry about showing identification.
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:41:08
Did you get the transaction id / details?  May be a longshot, but if the amount was bounced back to an internal Bitmit wallet then maybe Bitmit can find it &amp; credit your Bitmit account.
Stuff like this makes me nervous about sending BTC out of wallets I don't own, in case BTC get bounced back, etc..
@_date: 2013-10-24 00:36:43


That should be possible in theory.  But Coinbase itself is not anonymous, so really that's the paper trail right there.  If you consider a Coinbase -&gt; tumbler transaction anonymous enough then it's anonymous.
Otherwise you'd probably want to stick w/ cash + Localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-19 00:37:35
You could put in your numbers here &amp; figure it out yourself:
PS - The others are right.  There's nothing wrong w/ getting one (or some) Erupters if you want to mine as a hobby.  Don't do it expecting a ROI, you're not even going to mine $31.98 worth bitcoins w/ an erupter in any sort of short/long term.  In fact if you pay for your electricity you'd just be paying more in you electric bills than you'd ever make from mining.
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:38:08


I suppose that would be real-deal money laundering?  This is kind of like that scene in Office Space ;)
Not really sure what to suggest for you, but will mention that banks do report to the IRS so it's possible somewhere down the line they may get curious about where the $10k deposit randomly came from.
In theory the most anonymous would be to keep everything cash (&amp; do it through LBC), but that wouldn't work for very large amounts of buys/sells.
(This is for the U.S., not clear if this would be different in other countries.. )
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:42:09
Pretty much everyone on has been saying mining isn't worth it...  so yeah, there's that.
I don't know anything about your mining setup, but presumably you're bitcoin mining using CPU or GPU, definitely won't mine a profit using that.  In fact if you're paying for electricity you're actually losing money while shortening the life of your computer.
If you have a $5000+ ASIC miner in hand *and* are not paying for electricity *and* are mining with it right now, then *maybe* it's worth it.

Buying/selling on Coinbase will be the fastest thing you can find (outside of cash transactions via Localbitcoins).
re: MtGox, you cannot withdraw USD.  You may be able to do international USD wire transfers for deposits but I don't know how long it takes (frankly, it's best just to avoid MtGox completely if you're in the U.S.).
re: BTC-E, getting USD in/out of there is difficult if you're in the U.S.  I'm not even sure how to accomplish it (I've tried figuring it out to no avail).  You *can* technically do international wire transfers if you're doing at least $500 at a time.  Not sure how long that takes.
If you're willing to do international wire transfers you should really be doing trading at Bitstamp.
Also keep an eye on CampBX, esp. since you're in the U.S.  That's what I use personally, but they are lower trade volume vs something like Bitstamp.  Takes a while to get USD into there (mail a money order) but it's pretty easy to do an ACH withdrawal from there.  They are planning to implement ACH deposits at the end of the month so that *should* speed up deposits there in theory.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:16:31
ACH transfers takes 2-5 business days (not counting weekends/U.S. bank holidays obvs).  I can't tell from your post, have you already been waiting past 5 business days?  If you have, then yeah something might be up.  If you haven't, just be patient for now :)
It's cute that Coinbase tries to predict the estimated amount of days these deposit/withdrawal transfers will take to hit your checking account, but somehow I doubt it's a perfect measurement.  They have no control over how fast/slow the U.S. banking system will route these ACH transfers.
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:47:35
Did you search first?  Gox has been having major issues with USD withdrawals.

A bank check?  Why not just go to your bank &amp; have them issue a stop payment on the check?  Banks do that.  Unless I'm misunderstanding something about your situation?
A bit perplexing why he/she would even tell you a check would be fine, that's too much hassle since they'd need to wait 3-5-something business days just to make sure the check didn't bounce, &amp; the bank can always issue a stop payment so it's not nearly as good as cash.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:15:29
You should be fine, just don't save your user/password or 2FA on any web browsers.
If you end up with any huge quantities of BTC later you may want to consider moving some of that to an offline wallet.  I'd be OK w/ leaving small amounts of BTC in Coinbase for easy access.
@_date: 2013-10-05 00:29:44
Probably impossible at this point.
Maybe if it was right after you could have attempted data recovery/undelete, though honestly I'm not even sure if that exists for Android phones.  Somehow I think that may be possible on a rooted device, but it certainly wouldn't be a straightforward affair.  But either way, data recovery wouldn't be an option after a few days/weeks/months.

Bitstamp would probably be your best bet.
Technically BTC-E might be doable since you're probably looking at spending over $2000 easily, but I dunno they're a bit risky to do international wire transfers / SEPA into.
MtGox might work for you as long as you do all the verifications first (and you're not in the U.S.).
I have a feeling if you're a large investor that you can probably set up something w/ the individual exchanges if you manage to talk to the right people.  Or even look at things like

Merchants/vendors do care about lower fees.  And people do care about easier money transfers.  Whether buyers care *enough* to try out bitcoin is another question.  Then again, there's a ton of people that seem to trust Paypal for some reason, so I do think there's a huge untapped market somewhere.
Of course it's possible I'm the only person using bitcoin that hasn't been on SR (let alone buy/sell drugs w/ bitcoin), so take that for what it's worth ;)

To be fair, in "small world" New York City I really haven't seen any businesses that accept Dwolla.  I know Dwolla likes to tout this stuff on their homepage, &amp; maybe there's even some obscure bakery somewhere that accepts them, who knows.
Generally speaking I've seen *way* more businesses that accept Paypal, Google Wallet/Checkout, Amazon Payments, Square, etc..  But Dwolla?  No.
I get that Dwolla is a thing in, say, Iowa.  And Iowa has a stake in accepting paid taxes using a local startup.  But that doesn't translate into some kind of countrywide wave of customers that use Dwolla or even know what Dwolla is.

You're selling BTC to Coinbase, &amp; Coinbase sends USD to your checking account via an ACH bank transfer.  This past week is probably the worst week to be waiting on the U.S. banking systems.  I'd guess the processing times around 2-5 business days (no weekends/holidays) but I'm not sure if the Thanksgiving holiday throws things off.  As long as it's still processing &amp; not cancelled you should be fine.  (normally you'd get an email and/or see a cancellation in Coinbase if that occurred).


Same answer as above.  When you buy BTC from Coinbase, they initiate an ACH withdrawal from your checking account.  This itself will take some time, just like the ACH deposit.


No idea.  If you get a "high risk" cancellation just shoot them an email &amp; they can re-instate your order at the original price.  That said, first time users are usually the most at risk to that issue.  For what it's worth, if you stick it out 30 days after your first successful buy through Coinbase you should be less likely to have that issue.


Maybe?  Coinbase won't give you BTC if your ACH withdrawal was blocked by the bank, but if you do that enough times I'd think Coinbase might permaban your account.  (just guessing, I haven't seen anyone posting about doing this)
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:06:42
The hardcore money launderers are quite adept at that, though I'm not sure how "legal" it is to pull that off.  Overall that may depend on the country you're trying to open a bank account in, trick is many (most?) countries have laws about opening bank accounts if you're not living in said country.

You should start by finding a location near you that does Western Union money transfers via  , from there I assume you'd give them cash &amp; pay them a fee.

The best way is to not use Paypal to buy/sell bitcoins.
Is your Paypal connected to a bank account, &amp; is your bank account in the U.S.?  If so you could always withdraw to your bank account &amp; get set up on Coinbase to buy BTC there (they'll do an ACH withdrawal).
I'm not sure what country you're in, or if you have other options besides Paypal, but yeah there are a few non-Paypal options out there.

Yeah.. I'm still 100% sure this is a spam email attempting to get your Coinbase info.  Did you click the "Restore My Account" link &amp; enter your Coinbase login info there?
From your screenshots you're on Outlook.com.  You *can* view the email headers, just open the email, click Actions, click View Message Source.  That gives you the full text of the email.
Scroll down to the body of the message, can you tell us what link the email is telling you to click on for "Restore My Account"?  e.g. it'd be something like this:
Also, since you're in the header, the information there will give you info on whether it even came from Coinbase, or somewhere else.  You could paste it here if you want (remove your email address of course), or paste it into an email header analyzer website e.g.   or similar.

Depends on what you want.  Mtgox is an exchange while Coinbase is not.  If you're only looking to do some simple buy/sells every so often then Coinbase is probably all you need, otherwise if you want to do more active trading then you should really look at an exchange.

You're really looking for limit buys/sells, that's really the kind of stuff you'd want an exchange for (like Bitstamp).  See my post below for other exchange options.
re: Coinbase, if you have an Android device you can use the Coinbase Trader app to do simple limit buys/sells.  It's a nice workaround but if you're doing a lot of those types of transactions you should probably just trade on an exchange.

Though there have been 1-2 incidences (read here on relating to Coinbase, not quite a backdoor but incidents when the Coinbase user happened to save their login &amp; 2FA on a browser &amp; a person or malware happened to access that same computer/browser to get into a Coinbase account.

Not really.  w/ shipping each one of those cost $13.48.  And OP already stated needing to buy a hub which will add to the total.  OP didn't mention whether he/she pays for electricity, unless stated otherwise we may as well assume electric costs also come into play.  And on top of all that, the difficulty keeps rising!
So, you may never mine any of those costs back.  But if they're patient, maybe in a few years?  Though I think at a certain point the electricity costs mean you're going further &amp; further into the red &amp; would never get to a point of attaining profit.

For Paypal, no.  *Maybe* you can sell via Localbitcoins?  However, payment via Paypal is very fraud-prone &amp; Paypal themselves may reverse the transaction thus most bitcoin sellers won't touch it.

The VISA CC is just a backup payment method (in case the ACH withdrawal doesn't come through).  The primary payment method on Coinbase is always a linked U.S. checking account.

It's not that, it's just that the same issue gets posted *every day*, sometimes multiple times a day.  I guess we could start copying/pasting the same answers?  Frankly you haven't mentioned anything that makes your situation special or different from everyone else that posts about the same thing (though I am willing to hear you out).
Incidentally someone else posted about the *same* issue after your post today.
The answer that everyone else gets, in every other post, is to buy the bitcoin, transfer them out somewhere else (e.g. Coinbase) &amp; sell them there.  Yes, you'll be selling at a loss.  Your other option is wait 15+ weeks &amp; hope Gox eventually processes your withdrawal.  It might take longer than 15 weeks, so be wary.  It *does* suck but there's not much you can do about it.
If you're smart/very, very patient: Try to time your Gox buy when the price swings low, transfer your BTC out, then wait 'till the price is hopefully close/equivalent on Coinbase/CampBX/wherever &amp; finally sell.  It's kind of an alternate option I guess?

Ah, I'm not sure on that one.  Waiting on my own email response ;)
From what I understand Coinbase may push your order through if they review your order &amp; it turns out you weren't high risk.  Whether they mark your account as such for future orders, no idea.
Doing all the verifications is a good start but they still might flag your orders regardless.

Hmm..it looks like the option is still there, but I wouldn't trust anything through Dwolla at this point.
Sure you don't want to just do a $2 ACH withdrawal from CampBX?  You're only saving $1.75 going the Dwolla route after all.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:51:09


I think so?  But then you won't be able to buy/sell through Coinbase, Coinbase only does this through linked U.S. checking accounts.  (it can accept a VISA CC as backup, but it's *only* for backup charging in case the ACH withdrawal from your bank fails)
Just to be clear, you're not "depositing" $$ to Coinbase.  They don't hold your $$ ever.  When you buy BTC there, they do an ACH withdrawal from your checking account for payment of that BTC, &amp; if that clears you get BTC in your Coinbase account.

Currently only ACH withdrawals.  For deposits you're looking at mailing in USPS money orders.  That said, they *are* looking to add ACH deposits towards the end of the month.
They do have lower volume vs Bitstamp of course (ref [bitcoincharts] (  But there is activity, definitely enough for doing light trading.  You're going to want to be at Bitstamp if you want to do any sort of heavy trading though.
Their website could use a redesign ;)  But it does run fairly fast (e.g. compared to Coinmkt, tried them out recently &amp; the interface is way way slower than CampBX).
Seems pretty secure to me, just make sure to enable 2FA (which you're doing for all your websites, right?).
@_date: 2013-10-11 03:13:03
Google Wallet/Checkout?  Not only can you link CC's to it, but you can also link bank accounts &amp; fund your "wallet" just like Dwolla/Paypal/Coinbase.
It's strange that no one mentions them.  Not sure what their policy is re: bitcoin, but haven't heard of them shutting down accounts or doing anything anti-bitcoin in general.
@_date: 2013-09-30 17:49:38
For what it's worth, CampBX does has a lower fee vs Coinbase (.55% vs 1% for quick trades).
Depending on the price it is sometimes cheaper to buy BTC at the buy price on CampBX.  At the end of the day I like Coinbase for its simplicity but usually end up buying on CampBX.

There's no "earliest" you can sell to make a profit.  Since you're speculating you'd just have to wait &amp; see if BTC value goes up in a few days/weeks/months/whenever.  Of course BTC value could also go down, it works either way.
If you're in the U.S. maybe try CampBX if you want to set up a limit order to sell at a higher price than you bought.  Coinbase is great, but it's not really an exchange platform with people buying/selling at various prices.

5 days, or 5 business days?  (e.g. not counting Saturday/Sunday)  My last USPS money order did take them a while to credit, like 4-5 business days, but CampBX did eventually credit my account.
That said, would be nice if they cleared money orders faster.  I suspect they're swamped w/ deposits b/c of the Dwolla fiasco, hopefully this'll be easier when their roll out ACH deposits at the end of the month.
For some people the money orders don't ever clear (see their FB page for example), I'm not sure if that's CampBX or the post office though.

I've only traded BTC there so far.  I do have some XPM &amp; LTC too, but generally Cryptsy has been my goto for altcoin trading.  Re: comparison, I'd still prefer Cryptsy over Coinmkt but that could change if Coinmkt were to speed up their UI &amp; get more volume over time.
Coinmkt does have the advantage of being able to accept USD deposits, but when dealing w/ altcoins I usually just trade them for BTC, not USD.
@_date: 2013-10-25 03:44:17
Branded altcoins are indeed possible, but for those bigger financial companies would it make sense?  e.g. VISAcoin couldn't be decentralized since they'd want to keep control of it, thus a huge part of the bitcoin pro goes out the window.  Really if the CC companies thought of BTC as some sort of threat they could end up pursuing some sort of 0-1% transaction fee prepaid debit card.  Since the CC systems are already built out there'd be immediate support everywhere.  But would they do something like that knowing they'd be *losing* money instead of gaining any?  Seems unlikely.
For what it's worth, I do think there are opportunities for those types of companies to build services *around* bitcoin.  e.g. Paypal/Mastercard/Visa/etc could build escrow systems around bitcoin, they certainly have the capital to pursue it if they wanted.  The great thing about bitcoin is non-reversible transactions, but that also makes a lot of people uncomfortable, so things like escrow end up being the middle ground.  Just my two cents ;)
@_date: 2013-10-12 15:59:44
First: Coinbase isn't even an exchange.
If you're looking for an exchange, in the U.S. try CampBX or Coinmkt.  You'll need to mail USPS money orders to both of them for deposits, so no "instant" buys.
And there's always Localbitcoins (not an exchange, but always worth mentioning as a place to buy/sell)
@_date: 2013-09-25 19:27:56
That's a tough one, those questions are seeded from credit report history AFAIK.  Other websites that do this sort of verification use the same data (I don't know exactly how that works, just an observation).
You might want to get a [free credit report] ( just to check that your credit history makes sense.
Outside of that,  maybe just keep trying w/ different answers.  Or contact Coinbase &amp; see what they say?  Coinbase's support does take a while to get back to you but they do respond eventually.
Edit: I've verified my Coinbase account w/o those issues, but have read about other people on Reddit w/ your issue.  I'm also pretty anal about checking my credit history every year, dunno if that helps ;)
@_date: 2013-09-28 17:08:39

As long as you can reliably sell them in the UK it should be no problem, IMO.  This might work best if she doesn't need the whole BTC balance right away, e.g. just exchange some of them at first via LBC or other exchanges.  Then exchange the rest of the BTC later as you need them.
In theory if you guys are already set up w/a  linked bank account in the UK then cashing out via one the exchanges should be straightforward.  If you're going to pursue this then definitely make sure you have that set up prior to attempting any bigger transactions ;)
Of course the other risk is the possibility that the BTC value somehow crashes during that time period.  Unlikely IMO, but still a risk to consider.
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:00:15
This happened w/ my first purchase too.  But I emailed Coinbase &amp; they supposedly added me to their "whitelist" so future transactions aren't canceled for the same reason.  So far my other orders haven't had problems.
Also, they can still push through your order at the original sale price if you ask them to.
Their anti-fraud system seems automated to be extra cautious.  Hopefully over time they can tune it to be less cancellation-happy.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:28:26
Personally I have a separate checking account for anything connected to online services (e.g. Coinbase) so technically that's always an option if you want to be safe from any worst case scenarios.  Once Coinbase is connected to your bank account the possibility of a hack doing a withdraw from your bank account is a valid concern.
It also helps if you have a bank account that notifies you when deposits/withdraws happen.
Coinbase itself is mostly secure, just don't save your user/password or 2FA code on any web browsers.
That said Coinbase could use some beefing up of their security reporting.  Right now you don't get any emails when people log in from unknown IP addresses, you don't get a running list of login dates/times//IP addresses that accessed your account, half the time you don't even get an email receipt when a transaction occurred, etc.  I'm  not saying Coinbase is bad, just be mindful of your own security precautions.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:53:18


Yup, plenty of people have (just search &amp; you'll see other people's posts).  Not sure what to suggest, though I don't think it's a first/middle/last name issue.  CC AVS systems are usually checking the street address &amp; zip code, name/city/state doesn't really matter unless the system is set up to be very very strict.  Granted I don't know how Coinbase has their particular system set up.
The CC verification worked for me personally (if that matters).

re: identity tracking, just stick to Localbitcoin cash transactions.  Not sure why you'd even bother registering with any exchanges, let alone Coinbase.
If any tracking was done at all it'd be through the banking system.  Remember that your linked U.S. bank will see all incoming/outgoing transactions, whether it's ACH transactions, domestic/international bank wires, or simply lots of deposits/withdrawals.  Banks do report to the IRS at least.  None of that has anything to do with Coinbase specifically.
The above applies for the U.S., not sure on other countries (Coinbase is U.S. only so seems like a fair assumption you're in the U.S.)
@_date: 2013-10-16 19:35:29
Just a note, CampBX does have $2 ACH withdrawals.  A bit more expensive vs Dwolla, but ACH is way better than Dwolla overall.
Outside of that, for deposits you can send money orders or do wire transfers to CampbX or Coinmkt.  And there's also Kraken (they only do wire transfers at the moment).
AFAIK Coinbase is the only one that has ACH deposits *and* withdrawals (though they're not actually an exchange, more of a bitcoin "store").
EDIT: Bitstamp is also a very good option if you're OK doing wire transfers.

Every country is going to be different about this.
In the current scenario I'm thinking in the U.S. the taxes would be similar to whatever taxes apply to FOREX trading?  I have no idea how that gets taxed (any FOREX traders here?), thinking it'd be similar to capital gains &amp; you'd be taxed on whatever gains you made, if you converted them to USD during the tax year.  BTC itself likely wouldn't/couldn't be taxed directly, but the IRS would certainly notice if your USD bank account suddenly had $50k, $100k+ extra in deposits in a given year.
If, say 50%-100% of the population was suddenly using a non-USD currency then they'd likely adjust the tax laws accordingly.  e.g. maybe change up how income is taxed, or property taxes, or a national sales tax.. there are a bunch of different ways they can go about that.
That's just my guess, maybe someone who's paid taxes on FOREX trading has a more informed answer on this one.

If you're in the U.S. then you're not going to be able to get USD out of MtGox.  Try sending bitcoin to Coinbase or CampBX &amp; sell for USD there (they both support ACH USD withdrawal to U.S. banks).
Bitstamp is also good, but you'd probably need to do an international wire transfer to get USD out of there.  And there's always Localbitcoins &amp; bitquick.co if you want to try to sell for cash or bank deposit.
re: buying prices, usually MtGox is going to be the highest so you're really looking at buying high &amp; selling low.  Sometimes Bitstamp or Coinbase will be at at about even price-wise but you'd have to wait until that happens again, usually only happens when the BTC price is fluctuating up/down.

You can try BTC-E ($500 minimum, 7% fee, $2500 max per transaction).
What country are you in?  Is it unfeasible to sell your bitcoin for cash and/or bank transfer, then deposit that into your bank account to transfer to your Paypal?

Are you verified?  I believe it would be a $1000/day limit on all deposits/withdrawals if you're unverified.

To be honest I'm not sure what their procedure is when deposits happen to go over the cap.

Curious about this too.
Capital One is one to avoid for sure, not sure about others.  Presumably the others listed in LBC/bitquick.co should be OK?
The issue isn't really the whole ACH process like Coinbase does.  It becomes more problematic (for banks, I guess) when they think you're suspicious when your account is suddenly getting tons of cash deposits each month.  Someone on bitcointalk mentioned this is usually more of a problem w/ personal accounts, vs business accounts.  Maybe?

CampbX can't withdraw from Dwolla as of October 15th, so you wouldn't really be able to send anything to them via Dwolla as of that date.

Coinbase is generally problem free once you've made it through all the verification steps but it tends to be a rocky start.
Your issue is a weird one, you're saying you managed to make a purchase *before* verifying your bank account?  I didn't think that was possible.  Typically it's the other way around, you need to verify your bank before actually making a purchase.  You might've found a bug in their system if that's the case.
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:50:49


Not possible.  Based on your requirements you really don't have any options, sorry.  Coinbase is a very good option in the U.S. but does not meet your requirements.
If you specifically need to buy with a CC you can try  but I believe they'll want you to do some sort of verification.

Bitcoinity sorts their listing by order of exchange volume.  I like CampBX but they're a small player in the grand scheme of things.
To be honest I'm not sure what "online tracking site" OP is referring to, CampBX hasn't been dropped from anything AFAIK.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:06:07
Maybe [Litetree] (  Can anyone confirm?  Their [FAQ] ( does claim that they support ACH transfer, but I'm not that comfortable verifying my social security # with them so I've never really tried to find out for sure.
There are other U.S. exchanges but they don't support ACH transfers
 * CampBX: USPS money order deposits, ACH withdrawals
 * Coinmkt: USPS money order deposits, domestic wire transfer withdrawals.
 * Kraken: Domestic wire transfer deposits/withdrawals
The next closest is maybe  since they use SquareCash it's basically buying bitcoin with your bank debit card.  I haven't used them but it sounds promising, though I kind of wonder whether Square is going to allow transactions for bitcoin in the long term.
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:31:12
You really need to be using an exchange.  e.g.
 * Bitstamp
 * BTC-E
 * CampBX
(there are others, depends on your country &amp; ability to deposit/withdraw funds to the exchange)
[bitcoincharts] ( is also useful to compare volume between the exchanges (when it's not down, argh).
@_date: 2013-10-10 23:49:46
That's interesting.. maybe if you get your Coinbase receipts you could get a claim based on what you paid?  You won't get your bitcoins back, but at least it's something?
It kind of depends whether they insure cash that was stolen.
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:57:01
What country are you in?  You could probably get some suggestions if you at least provide that info.
Or if you've given up.. at least you tried?  Not sure what to tell you, in the U.S. it doesn't seem *that* difficult to get bitcoin but maybe it's just me.
@_date: 2013-09-15 18:32:28


Just curious why the extra requirement? e.g. Last I checked, ATMs at airports that withdraw multiple currencies do *not* require bio-metric scanners, just the user's ATM card is fine.  Not sure if perhaps they follow different rules b/c they accept ATM cards (assuming your ATM only accepts cash).  Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.
Also, you'd have better success if you secure your loan request.  Just saying :)  Good luck either way.
@_date: 2013-10-12 03:33:49
Nope!  I'm not aware of any that support it, was merely mentioning an idea ;)
I do wonder if it's worth it for Localbitcoins to add Google Wallet as an option?  They have Paypal on there &amp; that's far more risky.
@_date: 2013-09-18 02:37:52
Besides Localbitcoins another option to try out is  maybe?  I haven't tried them out yet, but seems pretty straightforward.  You basically do a cash deposit into one of their bank accounts &amp; the coins you bought get sent to your bitcoin address.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:46:46
I'm not sure if a bank would let you open an account with a temporary residence card, e.g. when you're just visiting.  Either way you'd need to at least physically be in Japan to even attempt this.

Can a bitcoin address exist without a private key?

Yes.  re: his list, I'd put CampBX before Bitstamp in terms of purchase ease.  (mailing a USPS money order is easier/cheaper than dealing with a bank rep to do an international wire transfer IMO)
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:17:55
In the U.S. I've been using CampBX &amp; Coinmkt (both allow USPS money order deposits).  Between the two CampBX is the better one IMO, Coinmkt just doesn't have enough volume yet (plus Coinmkt has a BTC withdrawal fee which is a bit weird IMO).
Both those exchanges don't have the trade volume of the bigger ones (Bitstamp, BTC-e) but they're easier to deposit USD into.
Don't use Gox, just avoid them, you can't reliably withdraw any USD from them (just search for all the other Reddit posts about that one!).
@_date: 2013-10-28 01:51:14
Only other thing I can think of, when you re-installed you did a clean re-install right?
Assuming you have all your Armory wallets backed up:
Try exiting out of Armory (make sure it's not stuck in the background), then go to your %appdata%\Armory folder &amp; delete (or temporarily backup) everything in there.  With the folder empty try restarting Armory &amp; see how it goes.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:54:18
Whatever you do, at the bare minimum encrypt your wallet &amp; backup bitcoin-qt's wallet.dat file somewhere off your computer (in case your "hard drive fries" like you said).  It won't matter if your computer catches fire, blows up, etc. as long as you have your wallet.dat file backed up somewhere.

@_date: 2013-12-18 22:43:54
Wouldn't a merchant just accept prices in BTC pegged to their local currency?  (e.g. USD/BTC).  Nothing changes there regardless of the BTC value going up or down.
In terms of what a merchant does *after* the transaction, that's up to them.  e.g. with Bitpay they can just cash out to USD/local currency immediately, if preferred.
Though IMO, if the merchant doesn't need the money from the sale *immediately* they can probably just hold onto the BTC &amp; eventually cash out amounts of BTC later on.  (hopefully when then BTC price is the same or higher vs the original customer transaction)
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:10:44
My CC verified fine, but other people are definitely running into issues w/ this.  Not sure what to suggest offhand, seems Coinbase is still working out the kinks on that one.
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:50:54
Jesset77 has the best answer (assuming you're in the U.S.!), but I'll add if you're just getting into bitcoin now then don't bother w/ mining.  Just buy/spend/sell your bitcoins.
Coinbase will have the most similar transaction system if you're coming from Paypal, you'll just need to connect your bank account to buy anything (similar to how Paypal works).
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:32:28


I thought it was the other way around?  When users have issues withdrawing funds from an exchange then their only way to "cash out" is to buy more BTC at that exchange to transfer out.  Lots of people doing the same thing would cause an increase in buyers vs sellers on the exchange, thus drive price up.  That's been the common thinking on why MtGox's price tends to be higher than the rest.
Realistically re: MtGox, the withdraw issues are mostly for U.S. based users (MtGox has huge issues wiring funds to U.S. banks).  In general users outside of the U.S. are still able to withdraw from MtGox.  Maybe not *quickly*, but very possible from what I've read here in @_date: 2013-12-03 05:50:22
Outlook does not look good.  Though you could ask the guy in the other thread if he ever actually got his bitcoin (seems unlikely, but who knows)

They're still working on rolling out ACH deposit AFAIK.

Outside of the U.S. I think some people use OKPay, not sure if that's an option for you.  Otherwise Lebitcoin is correct, getting fiat into BTC-E can be difficult/impossible for many people.
@_date: 2013-10-28 02:15:06
Yup, you should be safe w/ the paper wallet and digital backups.  Backup the %appdata%\Armory if you want to be on the safe side.
When you delete everything from the armory folder, try starting armory *without* copying anything back into it.  From the log, maybe the wallet itself is corrupt?  If so, you may have better luck importing it after getting Armory going again.
If that *still* doesn't work..  you may want to hit up Armory &amp; see what they say?  Aside from a possible corrupt wallet file I'm not sure what could be the problem :/
@_date: 2013-10-10 20:47:05
I sent them an email, I want to close my account but literally *just* initiated a deposit this morning.  And FML, the deposit clears on October 15th, same day CampBX would be unable to accept $$ from Dwolla.
October 15th is key, merchants would be unable to accept deposits via Dwolla so really Dwolla is useless to us as of October 15th.
re: Dwolla merchants:
*October 15 (1700h, Eastern Time): Your account will be limited to sending money only. You will no longer be able to receive funds from customers.*
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:48:40
You're right re: the 28th.  Not sure about that one.
If it's a significant amount of $$ maybe it's better to just do the $2 ACH withdrawal, you're only saving $1.75 using Dwolla after all.  Then again if it's under $10 you may as well stick it out since Dwolla would do it for free if it's under $10.
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:23:47


Why should they?  Payments involving cryptocurrency are against PP's terms of service, there's no reason they should even attempt to guarantee transactions that are against PP's rules.  If anything you would be lucky that PP doesn't freeze/cancel your account for being involved with bitcoin/litecoin/etc.  (they've been known to do that)


Maybe ask PP that question ;)  Not sure if anyone in works at PP to give you a real answer on that.


Yes, exactly.
Just to be fair, there *are* a few services that specifically deal with CC bitcoin transactions.  Just note that they do ask for *lots* of your personal information, &amp; also charge a high premium, b/c they are trying to avoid the CC fraud you mentioned. e.g.

Not sure what you're asking..?
Coinbase doesn't hold your $$, they just let you buy/sell bitcoin.  So when you send them $$ you'll get bitcoin in your Coinbase wallet.
You *can* transfer bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet to anywhere else that accepts bitcoins, including your account at Coinmkt.  (technically you can also send bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet to BTC-E, if that's what you're trying to do).

Coinbase is easy once you're set up.

Cereal-Spiller is right.  There is a reason Kickstarters need to fund 100% *first*, &amp; then accept other forms of payment (usually Paypal, ugh).
If your project starts off attempting to fund w/ other options, &amp; the main kickstarter funding does not meet its goal then the whole thing gets canceled.
My guess is you *can* accept bitcoin, but first you'd want to let the Kickstarter project fund 100% the regular route.  Once you know for sure the project is going to succeed then feel free to add all the other funding options you like.

Stick w/ bank transfers.  Or cash.  e.g.

* Bitstamp/BTC-E should be fine if you're OK w/the bank transfers.  I've read that Bitstamp can also accept deposits through Ripple, that may be an option if there's a Ripple gateway you can use in your country.  (I'm not with either so can't provide much more info on them)

Maybe...  but you *are* adding the software authenticator to your "Log In" &amp; "Security Center", correct?  Therefore you'd need the authenticator just to log in, let alone withdraw funds or change settings in Security Center.

That's only going to work for Indigogo campaigns with Flexible Funding, right?  (any campaigns that get your money regardless of whether the campaign's funding goal is successful or not)
In general any Indigogo or Kickstarter campaigns that *only* get funded when the main campaign is funded won't benefit from additional funding sources, including bitcoin, at least not in the beginning of the campaign.
It's the same reason that Kickstarter campaigns only accept Paypal funding *after* the main campaign is funded. (which.. technically they could accept bitcoin funding after the main campaign funds too!)
It would be cool if Indigogo/Kickstarter accepted bitcoin funding by default, then the funding can be part of the main campaign &amp; everyone wins :)

Otherwise, in general for Windows yes you'd go to your %appdata% folder.  The folder itself is hidden but once you're in there you can see everything inside it, so if you're there &amp; you don't see "bitcoin" then it's not there.
If it's on your old netbook, you'd need to take out its hard drive, hook it up to a USB adapter, &amp; then try browsing through it.  In that case, if Windows Vista/7/8, head into
    c:\users\(your-username)\AppData\Roaming
in there look for a "bitcoin" folder.

Incorrect re: torrent trackers.  None of the private trackers I'm on have ad banners on them.  Those do generally run on donations, or sometimes staff kicks in operating costs.  If they're smart they'll accept BTC for donations.  The problem is then paying for webhosting, etc.  Most of those don't accept BTC, thus the complication of cashing out BTC for a fiat currency.
You might be thinking of public trackers like TBP, KAT, that run ad banners on everything.  The ads may still not cover operating expenses.

Hate to say it, but you're going to end up losing both $$ &amp; the bitcoin you sent.  Selling bitcoin is against both Ebay &amp; Paypal rules so they won't help you, if anything there's the possibility of your Paypal account being frozen after this.

Why wouldn't it be?  Sounds like a standard cash deposit at a bank for bitcoins.  Lots of people do it, as well as a few other btc websites.
You'll likely need to send him/her a picture of the deposit receipt (or at least that's the usual requirement).
edit: I do think it's funny that they list 6am - 3am contact hours, there's no way you'd find an open bank branch to do a cash deposit at 3am, hah.

Any reason you specifically can't use CampBX anymore?  Is Dwolla a requirement for some reason?  Hate to break it to you, but Dwolla isn't going to partner with any crypto exchanges anytime in the near future. ;)
In the U.S.
 * CampBX Deposits: Mail in a USPS money order for deposits.
 * Coinmkt Deposits: Mail in a USPS money order, or do a bank wire transfer.
For non-exchange:
 * Coinbase: Link up your checking account to buy BTC
 * Localbitcoins: Cash or bank deposits for buying BTC.
 *  : Bank deposits for buying BTC.
EDIT: For what it's worth, CampBX is planning to implement ACH deposits towards the end of the month.  If that happens then depositing to them will be exactly the same as depositing into Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:07:28
In the U.S. to do easy buys/sells try Coinbase, or Locabitcoins, or bitquick.co.  Those aren't technically exchanges..
If you're looking for a real exchange check out CampBX or Coinmkt (CampBX also has lower fees vs Coinbase).  At the moment you can mail USPS money orders to deposit USD into them (Coinmkt also accepts USD wire transfers) so that's kind of a pain.  CampBX is looking to implement ACH bank deposits towards the end of November so that may be useful as well.
The bigger exchanges are outside the U.S., being Bitstamp or BTC-E, but for both you'd need to look at funding via international wire transfer deposit which may be costly depending on how much you're wiring.  Bitstamp also supports deposits through Ripple but I'm not sure exactly on the procedure for that.
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:12:32
Towards the end of 2010 they were at $.30 per BTC, assuming [bitcoincharts] ( is accurate.  That would mean you have about 50 BTC, or ~ $11,950 at current prices.  That's kind of a conservative guess, you might've bought them for slightly cheaper than that if you bought them earlier in 2010.
But honestly, I wouldn't overthink it.  You don't even know if you still have those coins, let alone if you can access &amp; open your old bitcoin wallet.  But maybe it was a good investment after all :)
EDIT: Not sure where to get data from April/June 2010, but yeah you probably would have more than the above estimate.

There's no guarantee.  There never was.
You're thinking of this all wrong, you *only* have what you currently have.  If you keep telling yourself you can magically trade back up to the original amount of $$ you had in the past then, really, you have a gambling problem &amp; need to stop.
You still have ~$280k, so you're still ahead of many people re: wealth &amp; such.  I'd strongly suggest holding onto the rest of that, put it in regular investments or something.  Frankly, you've already tried to day trade &amp; didn't do too well, best to stop now.  Come back to bitcoin w/ your own earned $$ if you like, just leave alone that shared $$ you have w/ your sister.

To be fair, I've sent money orders to CampBX &amp; they've received them fine.  USPS certainly isn't a pillar of reliability but you're making it sound like they'll lose every piece of mail going to CampBX. ;)

Local Bitcoins is probably fastest?
You could also try getting onto an exchange to sell them, but there'd be a delay withdrawing funds into a bank account, especially if you're setting up for the first time.
There's also Coinbase, though I suspect there'd be a similar delay if you need to add a bank account to withdraw funds into.

Whoa, that was a crazy thread!
But in the end it was the same thing, OP sent his BTC to a bitcoin address he did not own.  It just happened that the bitcoin address on the receiving end (what he thought was a TRC address @ btc-e) was actually a bitcoin address owned by btc-e.
You're right, it's interesting that TRC apparently uses the same addresses as bitcoin. (which is why in that thread btc-e really owned both the terracoin &amp; bitcoin addresses associated with the same private key)  But in the end a bitcoin transaction can't jump off the blockchain &amp; into an altcoin's blockchain, just isn't technically possible.

Merchants can't really tell what the limit on a CC is without actually attempting an authorization of that amount or higher.  Coinbase doesn't do that, they just do two tiny test charges to check that the CC is good.  So there's no need to worry about the CC limit.

In the U.S. Coinbase is easiest.  If you want something more akin an exchange w/ buys/sells try Campbx.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:32:15
It's not much of a comparison, w/ Bitfloor you'd get credited to your account within 30-60 mins of the cash deposit at the bank.
Mailing a money order means you have to wait a few days for USPS to actually deliver it (assuming they don't outright lose it in transit!) &amp; then waiting another few days until CampBX actually cashes it &amp; credits your account.
I haven't personally had problems w/ CampBX cashing money orders (though they're slow) but obvs it can get problematic for some people, e.g. OP's situation.

 * Don't save your user/password on any web browsers
 * Don't save your 2FA on any web browsers
 * Don't do the "instant" bank verification (just let them do the 2 small deposits into your checking account)

Might be safer to establish a 2nd wallet somewhere else (either offline, or on your computer, or another online wallet).  The flipside is, if you do carry one on your laptop you should create a good passphrase for the wallet &amp; have a good back up routine for it.
And **ENABLE** 2FA on *all* online wallets you create, including Coinbase!  (Also, a strong login password doesn't hurt either)
@_date: 2013-10-27 15:57:22
You may as well plug it in &amp; run it, at least until you're uncomfortable w/ the electric costs (if you're paying for electric).
Outside of that, you could just try selling it on bitmit or wherever, there's a chance that you'll make more money that way vs attempting to mine with it.
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:17:49
Just have a separate checking account at another bank for for your bitcoin, online transfers, etc.  (obvs if you're being proactive you're not going to connect *any* 3rd party websites to your main bank account, right?)
And probably avoid Chase &amp; Capital One.
Some good info:

OK, then mail a USPS money order to CampBX or Coinmkt &amp; wait to buy BTC at the price you like.
Anyways, it seems like you're going way out of your way to rule out every possible option so I can't think suggestions to help you.
Since you seem to be *really* worried about waiting a few days you should really just suck it up &amp; do cash transactions via Localbitcoins or  it'd be faster at least.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:51:45
Wow, probably not.  Have you been using Windows/Linux on the same drive for the last 5+ months?  Should've mentioned that part!
Two things you could try:
1. Run  on the drive &amp; see if it manages to find your old wallet.dat file.
2. Boot off a Linux rescue disc/USB &amp; run [PhotoRec] ( on the drive, &amp; maybe Testdisk.
Thing is, by now you have like a .01% chance of recovering a deleted file if you've been using the same computer/hard drive all this time.  Now, if you had immediately shut off the computer &amp; removed the hard drive from the moment you deleted the file you would've had more of a 99% chance of recovery.. maybe next time ;)

A few options offhand
 * Coinbase
 * bitquick.co
 * Localbitcoins
 * CampBX
 * Coinmkt
Intl Exchanges:
(if you're comfortable w/ international wire transfers or similar)
 * Bitstamp
 * BTC-E
There are of course other options as well, but the easiest for users in the U.S. is Coinbase if you just want to buy/sell a few BTC.  Otherwise take a look at the exchanges if you're thinking of doing more trading.
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:39:35
There's also Coinmkt, but I don't think they have an API (yet).
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:06:57
It might be possible, depends heavily on how easily/quickly you're able to deposit/withdraw USD from both exchanges.  Hint: if you're in the U.S. your plan is not possible at all.

It's an ACH transfer to/from your bank.  ACH transfers have never been instant, they've always taken somewhere around 2-5 business days.  That's not Coinbase, it's just the U.S. banking systems.


??  What addresses do you speak of?  Coinbase controls all their bitcoin addresses.  Outside of that, it sounds like your paranoia level is very high.
@_date: 2013-09-04 21:14:37
Yes.  Which is why, technically, you shouldn't be backing them up.
On Android, Google doesn't provide a real backup method for Google Authenticator codes *by design*.  The QR codes are meant to be used that one time, then thrown away once your authenticator app is synced up.
So if you're going around those precautions, absolutely do not keep the backups on the same phone/device/computer.

What country?  It's not really possible to get USD out of MtGox to a U.S. bank account.  (presumably you're in the U.S.)
If you're in the U.S. check out
 * [Bitstamp] ( (plenty of trade volume)
 * [CampBX] ( (not as much trade volume as the bigger exchanges, but easier to withdraw USD by far)
 * [Coinmkt] ( (they're based in the U.S. but probably have the least volume in this list)
 * [Kraken] ( (depends if they allow USD trades for your state)
 * [Vault Of Satoshi] ( (haven't used them but looks promising)
For just a quick buy/sell you can always use Coinbase too (but they're definitely not an exchange for any sort of volume trading)
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:26:32
Not possible, the code would just get forked (even easier since it's open sourced).
But since you're curious, this sort of thing *has* happened before.  Just look at [eDonkey2000] ( after the lawsuit the code was destroyed/shut down.  But the P2P nodes were not affected, &amp; eventually users just migrated to eMule which already had an open source version of the same protocol.  Interestingly Jed McCaleb went on to be a major part of MtGox &amp; eventually Ripple, it's funny how these things work out ;)
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:41:43
If you have a debit card, then you have a bank account.. just link it up to Coinbase &amp; buy from there ;)
If you really do prefer CCs check out  just be prepared to pay an extra fee for using a CC.  (though I think they're going to ask you for personal details anyway, since CC transactions tend to be fraud-prone)
You can also check out CampBX (USPS money deposits), I don't think they'll ask for much KYC info if you're doing small deposits/trades.
And there's always Localbitcoins / bitquick.co if you just want to do cash purchases &amp; keep your anonymity.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:30:48


Also, if you have a CC you could maybe try  or  but they're going to be expensive too.  Anything related to Paypal/CC + bitcoin is going to be crazy expensive b/c of the chargeback fraud.
@_date: 2013-10-19 20:22:31
OK..?  [16rjg4] ( did say try to *buy* US dollars with a CC.  And you replied with a different idea for taking out a loan instead of outright buying currency.  So you guys agree then, there's no way to *buy* US dollars with a CC. :)
But to your point, yes you can take out a loan for some US dollars.  Whether OP is specifically looking for a BTC loan is another question..
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:13:38
You can do some arb for sure, but the problem is slow USD deposits.  Mailing a money order deposit takes about a week or so for CampBX to credit your account.  It's doable, but you may get stuck waiting while the BTC price goes up/down.
There will likely be *way* more volume there once they implement ACH deposits IMO, which should close the gap a bit.

You have an up-to-date bitcoin-qt installed on your system, right?
Two things to try: bitcoin-qt's salvagewallet option or pywallet.  Neither are guaranteed to work, but at least you can try ;)
Salvagewallet:  I've never needed to use it, so can't guarantee it'd work.. but try something along these lines:
 1. Exit Bitcoin-qt
 2. Delete/rename whatever current wallet.dat files are in your Bitcoin folder (e.g. for Windows it's in %appdata%\bitcoin).
 3. Copy your corrupt wallet.dat into your Bitcoin folder (or any corrupt wallet you want to attempt recovery from)
Now when you attempt to launch bitcoin-qt, make sure you launch with the -salvagewallet option. You may need to do this from the command line, or add the -salvagewallet option to your bitcoin-qt shortcut e.g.
bitcoin-qt.exe -salvagewallet
Supposedly what it will try to do is launch Bitcoin-qt, rename the current wallet.dat file, &amp; attempt to salvage that corrupt wallet.dat's public/private keys into a brand new wallet.dat file.
quick ref: 
For pywallet, make sure to download/install [Python 2.7.6] (  Then try running something along these lines:
    python.exe pywallet.py --dumpwallet --datadir=%appdata%\bitcoin --passphrase="whatever your passphrase is" &gt; bitcoindump.txt
If pywallet works you'll have a text file with your wallet dump contents. For each "addr" you'll see its associated info in separate fields.
Good luck!

Ah OK, your problem is w/ the  site, not Coinbase.  (should've put that in your post's title!).  Honestly I have no idea how that site works, sorry :/
Offhand what I'd suggest is to sign up for Coinbase directly at  then see if you can send the amount from trybtc over to your Coinbase wallet.
In Coinbase, after you're signed up, click on Account Settings, then Bitcoin Addresses, then click Create New Address.  The address you created is your new bitcoin receive address, just copy/paste that into trybtc somewhere to send bitcoins from trybtc's wallet to your Coinbase wallet?  Something like that.. like I said, I don't really know how trybtc works..

To be fair, only crazy people take Paypal.  You might reverse the charge on them, or Paypal themselves might cancel the transaction.
But.. if that's really what you're going for, maybe  ?  They put a 60-day hold on paypal transactions so it's going to be a long wait.  (60 days is incidentally the timeframe Paypal gives to dispute a transaction)
Also, I don't know if they require proof of address documents..
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:31:07
Sorry, none of this makes sense..  did you have two factor authentication enabled on *both* BTC-E and GMail prior to downloading that software?

@_date: 2013-10-12 21:04:27
True.  Not much profit, but in theory you could make roughly $7 (it'd be less than this when the difficulty rises of course!).  That means you'd need to obtain an erupter for under $7, including shipping.

This gets asked a lot ...
In general, the only way to deposit USD from the U.S. is via an expensive international wire transfer ($2000 minimum, 1% fee, minimum $20 fee, plus whatever fee your bank will charge).  There is no other way AFAIK.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:21:09


You don't, unless you're based in Japan w/ a bank account there.  Best to buy BTC in MtGox &amp; transfer that out, AFAIK it's the only viable way to do it.
But I guess if you're patient.. it's been 6 months, maybe give them another 6 months?  I wouldn't hold my breath on that one.
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:58:22




No.  Maybe not with a $10k+ rig either, the difficulty is rising too fast.  That sort of thing depends on whether you pay for electricity, how much you got the rig for, how soon you're going to have it up &amp; running, etc.


No.  Err.. well I've always assumed those things are scams.
From your questions it sounds like you're thinking bitcoin is free money when it's really not.  You should just buy bitcoins (Coinbase, Localbitcoins, Bitquick, etc.).  Or sell stuff on Bitmit.
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:54:20
To be fair, you have an address that a package was shipped to.  Not technically the buyer's home or work address.  Scammers never have stuff shipped to an address connected to them.
But I kind of agree w/ you, if the buyer has a good history on Ebay then it's unlikely he/she is a scammer.  Just don't rely on Paypal to figure that out.  People have been scamming sellers w/ Ebay/Paypal for years, long before Bitcoin was ever around.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:54:07
Did you actually have 46 BTC there?  They were hacked a while back, AFAIK all the payouts &amp; whatnot are frozen due to all the pretend BTC balances there.  Not sure why people are still using them TBH.
@_date: 2013-09-29 10:44:44
You should really do a search on Reddit, this stuff has been discussed before.
But the quick answer: You will *not* mine anything significant with a CPU or graphics card, or even a USB Erupter.  In fact you'll spend more money buying any of the above + electric costs.  There's nothing stopping you from mining, but will *not* make any sort of profit.
If you have some $$ to spend, best to just buy bitcoins &amp; not deal with mining.
@_date: 2013-10-19 22:26:49
Sure they are listed
Their volume might be a bit lower since the Dwolla fiasco, but then again they've always had lower volume vs a bigger exchange, e.g. Bitstamp.
EDIT: Yes I still use them, but of course getting USD into them is a bit annoying with the mailing a money order routine.
@_date: 2013-10-14 00:49:27
Depends on your idea of the "best"?
re: Deposits/withdrawals the situation is a bit tricky.  CampBX &amp; Coinmkt are both exchanges in the U.S. so maybe check them out?
CampBX Deposits: USPS money orders.
CampBX Deposits for verified accounts: They also accept Personal checks.
Coinmkt Deposits: 1% fee Wire transfers &amp; USPS money orders.
CampBX Withdrawals: $2 ACH withdrawals, $20 wire transfers, &amp; $20 USPS money order.
Coinmkt Withdrawals: Wire transfers &amp; USPS money orders (not sure on fees?)
There's also Coinbase, not an exchange but they're pretty easy to do ACH deposits/withdrawals with.  And there's always Localbitcoins.

You're asking about cash &amp; then asking about Paypal, they're not the same thing.
For cash transactions check out  or 
For Paypal... can't really help you there, too many scammers use Paypal so hardly anyone deals Paypal for bitcoin.  But you could check out [eobot] ( if you wanted (higher fees + 45-day hold for Paypal transactions).

Being in the U.S., depositing USD there is a bit annoying since I'd have to physically go to my bank &amp; set up a domestic wire transfer to them.  (at least CampBX/Coinmkt gives me the option of mailing in a USPS money order.. which isn't great, but better than dealing with a bank rep!).  That said, it's probably easier for people outside the U.S. that can do SEPA transfers?
Other than that, not sure.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:02:00
Just log into Bitstamp, click Deposit, there you'll see your options.
AFAIK if you're in the U.S. you'd need to do an international wire transfer to deposit USD to Bitstamp.
Bitstamp technically has support for Ripple deposits, but I'm not aware of places in the U.S. you can buy Ripple for USD (you can buy them for BTC, but that defeats the purpose of trying to send USD to Bitstamp!)
@_date: 2013-10-15 23:15:39

You're sure the wallet.dat wasn't corrupted at some point, right?
I haven't seen that error, but one thing to try is the -upgradewallet flag with bitcoin-qt, so when it launches it tries to upgrade your wallet.dat file (if indeed it is *that* old).  No guarantees of success, but it's worth a shot?
Rough steps (assuming you didn't already upgrade bitcoin-qt)
 1. Make a copy of your original wallet.dat file to somewhere else (the original can be located in your %appdata%\bitcoin folder normally)
 2. Delete that entire %appdata%\bitcoin folder
 3. Install/upgrade to the latest [bitcoin-qt] ( (should be 0.8.5)
 4. Launch bitcoin-qt like normal, let it sync the blockchain (this will take a while)
 5. After its all synced up, shut it down, then copy your old wallet.dat file into your new %appdata%\bitcoin folder (it's OK to copy over the new wallet.dat file in there, you don't really need it)
 6. Go into the command line, browse to your bitcoin program folder, you'll want to run something like this:
    bitcoin-qt.exe -upgradewallet
... &amp; hopefully bitcoin-qt will start up &amp; attempt to upgrade your old wallet.  If none of that works, bitcoin-qt also has a -salvagewallet flag you can try on the old wallet.dat file &amp; see if that helps.  And if all else fails, try using pywallet to extract your keys.  Something along these lines (FYI pywallet works with Python 2.7.6 AFAIK)
    python.exe pywallet.py --dumpwallet --datadir=%appdata%\bitcoin --passphrase="whatever your passphrase is" &gt; bitcoindump.txt
.. If the above works you should have a new txt file with your wallet file dump, each bitcoin "addr" has its associated info under it. (you might have a lot of separate addresses in there!)
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:08:03

You should probably just send them a message.  I have a hunch that you just had the high risk cancellation thing, but you'd normally get an email about that so it's not entirely clear.

I'd expect it Friday/Monday/Tuesday.  (giving it 3-5 business days)

It's very, very difficult/impossible to deposit/withdraw USD to BTC-E if you're in the U.S.  If you *really* need to use BTC-E then send BTC there to trade for altcoins, don't bother trying to send/receive USD from there.
That said, here are your options:
 * International wire transfer ($2000 minimum, 1% fee, $20 minimum fee)
 * International wire transfer ($1000 minimum, 1.5% fee, $150 minimum fee)

To be fair, if you live in Japan &amp; have a japanese bank account you're probably making all sorts of bank on the arbitrage ;)
If you're not in Japan.. yeah, no idea why you'd be using Gox.  Probably b/c newer bitcoin users think it's the biggest exchange when really [Bitstamp] ( is the bigger &amp; more liquid exchange nowadays..
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:13:33
You're going to have to figure out how to get that stuff, otherwise your bitcoin will be stuck at MtGox long term.  Not sure what to tell you.
You also have to be 18+ to verify at MtGox, usually people 18+ have at least one of those bills/utilities in their name, but I get that's kind of on a case-by-case basis.

If you're just looking to buy bitcoin you don't necessarily *need* to sign up for an exchange, that'd be up to you.  An exchange is really set up more towards doing lots of buying/selling.
Coinbase is by far the easiest to use, but you do have some other options.

When you opened your bank account did they give you a set of starter checks?  Both your account &amp; routing number are right there at the bottom of the checks.  You will need both of those numbers to verify/connect the bank account on Coinbase, otherwise Coinbase is going to be useless to you.

Who runs the ATM?  I bet it's the company that owns the ATM, &amp; a certain percentage of the sale goes to the store/bar/whatever that has the ATM there.  That's exactly how regular cash ATMs work (the $$ certainly isn't coming from the bar/supermarket/etc).
Think of it as Coinbase, but as an ATM.  (Coinbase itself is really just a bitcoin store, you're buying/selling from *them*, not a community of users).
Outside of those specific use-cases, the majority of bitcoin transactions are between people.  e.g. if you sell on an exchange like Bitstamp then you're selling to someone that was trying to buy BTC on that particular exchange.  If the trade is successful the exchange will take a small cut of the sale (the fee) &amp; that's how they make their own profit.
EDIT: re: the bitcoin ATM, I'd add that I haven't really read into it too much, but wouldn't surprise me that's how it works.  Can't imagine why/how the ATM would be directly linked to Bitstamp or whatever, that would be overly complicated.

If you're using Coinbase that means you have a checking account in the U.S...  you can't withdraw USD from MtGox to the U.S., thus arbitrage is not possible.  (not possible for you, anyway.. for other people yes, but they won't be using Coinbase since they'd be outside the U.S.)

A bank is not an exchange.
In a bitcoin exchange, much like stock market exchanges, you're buying/selling BTC from other users in the exchange who are buying/selling their own BTC.  The exchange itself profits by charging a fee for each successful transaction.
For what it's worth, something that's not a bank nor an exchange would be Coinbase.  They're more like a bitcoin "store", anything you buy/sell with them means you're buying/selling from them specifically.  They get their own BTC from other people selling BTC to them, as well as their own reserves (supposedly they do their own trades through Bitstamp).
@_date: 2013-09-14 23:25:52
Sounds like a misunderstanding then.  He/she may have thought you were trying to transfer/wire $$ to another bank, thus you would've needed a bank account there first.  e.g. you can't deposit something at a Chase bank for a BoA account without having an account at the Chase to deposit into.
Normally you'd go to the bank &amp; fill out a deposit slip w/ your seller's account info.  Then go to the teller, tell them you're making a deposit, &amp; give them the deposit slip &amp; the amount of $$ on the slip.  It's not something out of the ordinary, employees from bars/restaurants/retail stores/etc make these sort of deposits all the time.

What did you expect exactly?  Paypal routinely cancels transactions involved with bitcoin, &amp; yes they likely bounced the transactions out of Eobot's old Paypal account back into your Paypal account.  Eobot would not have been able to withdraw your payment from Paypal regardless.
From Eobot's perspective your Paypal payment(s) never made it to the 45 day window, thus you never really paid for BTC from them.
It's surprising it took that long for Paypal to cancel Eobot's account, I guess they had a good run while it lasted. ;)  It's also surprising that so many people still insist on buying BTC with Paypal, but I guess if there's a market maybe another Eobot will spring up somewhere &amp; attempt the same thing.

Simplest/quickest would be Coinbase.  Bitpay is also definitely worth a look.
From a merchant perspective, think of implementation similar to implementing Paypal, Google Wallet etc.  e.g. customers will have balances in their own wallets/accounts.  You'll also have your own wallet/account that customers send funds into for purchases.  The collected balance you can withdraw or leave in the wallet for a period of time, depending how you run your business.

I agree that people should actually be spending bitcoin, otherwise people outside of really won't see what the point is.


However, there are definitely costs for a business owner associated to accepting a new payment method.
 * They'd have to spend $$/time training employees.
 * They may not a tablet set up, or a screen POS set up to swivel around to face customers.
 * They might not have wireless internet running in the location, and/or might be set up in a building where cell service is a bit crappy.
 * Their entire end-of-day / end-of-year financials are going to be different &amp; would need to be updated.  Accountants hate changing things, trust me ;)
 * Extra customer service when things go wrong ("Sorry, the transaction was never confirmed for some reason, maybe it's just taking a while. Oh, you use a Coinbase wallet? Better settle in for a bit!", etc.)
 * Money might be tight, so assuming they can spend time/$$ on all the above then they certainly won't be in a position to hold any bitcoin.
Yes, all of those things are fixable.  But after you put in all the time/$$ towards all that &amp; only get like 1-2 customers using bitcoin over a month/year/whatever, what was the point of bothering with it?
This is just stuff I think about since I work with small businesses, they typically don't want to spend extra time/$$ on anything unless there's actually going to be some return on it.

Correct, they're not even accepting signups from the U.S. right now.  Last I checked BTC-E wasn't accepting wire transfers from the U.S. either.
That might leave Payeer as the only way to get USD into BTC-E maybe?  Hopefully your wire ends up clearing eventually!

Yes, you can.  I don't think you understood him, he's not talking about CCs he's talking about Paypal specifically.
People open disputes on Paypal &amp; get refunds *all the time*.  And w/ any virtual currency it's trivial, Paypal doesn't even like dealing w/ virtual currencies so not only would you get your $$ back but they'd likely freeze the other person's account.
(incidentally, this is why no legitimate seller would accept Paypal as payment for bitcoin)

Should be fine, I've done a few sells through Coinbase &amp; never had a problem with the transaction or the ACH transfer.

It's best not to mix bitcoin with Paypal/CC, but if you *really* want to go that route there's always  or  though their rates are pretty high since they have to deal with CC fraud.  (it might be cheaper to stick to Localbitcoins).

And you listed all the places that typically accept credit cards.  Some of them also accept debit/ATM pin pad transactions, but those people don't benefit from adding Dwolla when they're already set up to do it directly.
Lets be honest, payment via bank transfers is not a big thing in the U.S. vs say Euro countries that do this on the regular.  You're claiming this *might* be a big thing in the future.  It's possible?  Who knows?  Dwolla might not even make it to that point.  25 cents on $10+ transfers doesn't support a business, other people have already written about that.

That said, in theory yes if you sell at 151.01 at Mt Gox, then wait a while &amp; hope the price goes down you can buy more bitcoins.  You might have to repeat a few times to get some sort of real profit, but it should be doable if you're patient.

What if we think bigger?  Lets say, in this future world you propose, by this time bitcoins are being used on a massive scale.  Lets say it's at about the same volume as credit card transactions.  In [2011] ( this comes out to around 135.33 billion/year.  If my math is right, that's about 257,477 transactions per minute.  re: transaction fees, *if* the fee was the same in this future then that'd equate to about 1.29 BTC in fees per minute, or ~ 676,650 BTC in fees per year.  (one unknown is how much 1 BTC would be worth in this future, doubt it'd be $200)
Honestly?  I think the fee would have gone up by that point, hell it would have gone up sometime before all the blocks were even mined.  The last few blocks will likely take *years* or longer to mine, so the community will deal with the idea of increasing fees to keep the miners going.  So really, 676,650 BTC/year in fees would be the bare minimum to expect that far out in the future.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:52:12


You don't.  Way too risky for both parties, especially the seller.  Too much fraud on the buyer's part.  In addition Paypal themselves may cancel the transaction &amp; freeze associated accounts (since bitcoin is against their TOS).
The thing about that SL linden dollar thing is you're not actually buying bitcoin with Paypal, you're buying something else &amp; exchanging it for bitcoin.  In that sense, maybe buy something people would buy, using your Paypal, &amp; then sell it on   maybe?
Or just go the normal route &amp; buy bitcoins with cash, bank deposits, etc., at other exchanges.

Paypal has frozen my account so many times that I can't think of any Paypal "benefits", honestly.  And that's not counting bitcoin-related transactions.  (Hint: They do not like virtual credit cards, and or you using more than say 2+ credit cards on an account!)

Paypal has also been a major PITA for people running projects on Kickstarter/Indigogo, e.g.

re: CC, I wouldn't directly compare that to bitcoin since they are very different financial instruments.  CC implies credit &amp; loans (yes, that $50 purchase you made on a CC implies a loan the CC company gave you that they expect payment on at the end of the month).  Bitcoin is certainly not anything resembling a credit and/or loan system, at least not in its current form.  It's really more akin to cash, or gold, or something along those lines.
It's nice to think that everyone in the world qualifies for a CC, but realistically there's a large percentage of the population that either can't qualify for a credit card and/or can only qualify with very unfavorable terms.  Not to mention the whole idea of credit seems a bit Americanized, ever talk to your friends from Europe, etc., a lot of them have never had a need for a credit card.

Well, it *is* Paypal so it's quite easy to open a dispute.  Heck, if you mention bitcoin they might reverse the transaction even faster!  (though I'm not sure what exactly Paypal will do with your own account).

Overall this is why no one really accepts Paypal.  Basically the only way to accept a Paypal transaction &amp; *not* have it reversed on the seller is to wait 60 days.  But no one wants to pay for bitcoin &amp; then wait 60 days for it to arrive, so in the end nobody wins.

Hmm... not sure if you're spreading FUD or just confused.. the "instant withdrawal" you're referring to is the old CBX voucher/coupon withdrawals they had (reference: [FAQ] ( under CBX Instant).  Yes, those are disabled.  They are also disabled at Gox, Bitstamp, pretty much all the reputable exchanges.  This is due to FinCEN regulations.  ( all the exchanges could have gotten in hot water over that.
re: your Dwolla issue, I've read that the 32 day countdown could accidentally be kicked of if you clicked on the old "Dwolla" withdrawal option.  It's been removed now, but you're right, CampBX support should have fixed that for you.  While CampBX has worked well for me, I do worry their support is.. *ahem*, lacking.
re: them being "insolvent".  I don't quite understand how an exchange can be BTC insolvent, you understand when you're buying BTC there you're buying from users that are selling their own BTC there, right?  And vice versa.  You're not ever buying/selling BTC from CampBX directly, they make their $$ from the fee they charge on each trade.
If you're saying the exchange is taking everyone's buy/sell BTC out of the exchange, that's a pretty big accusation.. how would the exchange even function in that case?  There couldn't be any buys/sells at all, right?

You can't really.  Technically you can chance a international wire transfer deposit ($2000 minimum, 1% fee, $20 minimum fee) , if you wanted.
Weirdly, the Ecoin USD deposit option might actually work (since they seem to accept ACH deposits and/or check/M.O. deposits from what I understand?).  But that service is very shady.  Just to get an account going they want a passport scan in addition to all the other verification docs, seems way too risky.
There's also the possibility of doing a QIWI transfer to RUB deposit in BTC-E, but I have had 0% luck actually funding a QIWI account from a U.S. CC or bank transfer.  At this point I think the only way to fund BTC-E from the U.S. is with deposited BTC or altcoins.

If you're verified on CampBX you could do a $2 ACH withdrawal.  I'm thinking I'll need to go this route myself :/  $2 is annoying, but not crazy.  USD wire transfers to other exchanges would normally cost you more than $2, for example.
Coinbase is also a good alternative as afar as doing withdrawals *and* deposits via ACH.
And there's always Localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-08-30 19:03:23
Or open a separate checking account for this stuff w/ a minimum balance.  You'd transfer additional funds in/out as needed.
Seems safer not to have online/trading accounts connected to your main bank accounts IMO.  Otherwise you'd be in a bad situation if your Gox/Coinbase/Dwolla/Paypal/whatever account gets hacked *and* the hacker has direct access to your main bank accounts.

You should review their [accepted payments policy] (  Bitcoin is not on there.
Yes, you can maybe put bitcoin in the description, and/or email customers after the sale has ended, but since you're running afoul of Ebay's policies there's a chance they may cancel your order and/or close your Ebay account.

Just FYI, Coinbase is U.S. only (need a U.S. bank's checking account to link it).  Wasn't sure if you're in the U.S. (since you're talking about EUR &amp; SEPA).
If you're in the UK you have other options (e.g. Bitstamp can do SEPA).
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:50:44
I'd suggest Coinbase, but I don't know if you can get verified?
Localbitcoins meetup or bank deposit, or bitquick.co if you want to try buying w/ cash (maybe rule out Localbitcoins if there's really no sellers in your area).  That won't require you to provide proof of address.
CampBX might also be an option, I don't think they need KYC info for amounts under $1000 (you'll need to mail them a USPS money order to deposit funds).
You could also sell stuff on Bitmit for bitcoin (but they might also need you to upload documents to get verified).
You're really looking at doing cash transactions if you can't do any sort of address verification, almost all the online methods require some sort of KYC.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:03:35

Some background on why they may have done so:
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:15:06
Sorry, once they're gone they're gone.  :/
You've got an IP (from the BTC-E access, or the Gmail access attempt?), it's likely someone that accessed through a proxy, Tor, etc. so not sure how useful it'll be.  But you could technically try to report the theft to LE &amp; see how it goes?  Depends who handles that sort of crime in your country.  BTC-E is pretty shady so not sure how cooperative they'd be with any sort of LE investigation.
Doesn't help much now, but you *really* should enable two factor authentication on all bitcoin-related websites.  Also do it for your bank/credit card sites if possible, as well as Google/Gmail if you haven't already.  BTC-E's security isn't great, but two factor authentication would have helped a lot.
EDIT: Your work computer may not necessarily be involved, but has it been checked it for viruses/trojans/etc?  *Maybe* someone at your work accessed your BTC-E account, but that seems unlikely (though I don't know anything about your work, so perhaps?).

Coinbase itself is very safe.  I wouldn't go so far to say they're hack-proof, or that your own computer/accounts could be hack-proof, but it'd be very low risk going w/ Coinbase.
There's nothing wrong w/ having a separate bank account for linked online stuff, that's what I do.  e.g. have you linked any bank accounts to your Paypal / Google Wallet / Dwolla / etc. accounts?  My point is Coinbase is hardly the first company looking to link bank accounts to make transactions easier.
If you're just worried about the pw (vs linking the bank account), some people first change their bank pw, then do the Coinbase verification, then change their bank pw back to whatever it was.

Paypal typically cancels orders involving virtual currencies.  They also go out of their way not to cover those transactions, which makes it a much riskier transaction.

I was under the impression that each USB erupter can use up to 1A, but maybe I'm wrong?  If that's true then the included power adapter for the hub definitely can't handle 9 x erupters at the same time.

That site mostly exists to push their merchant account service, you'll even see the ads in every forum post.  So they certainly wouldn't push a payment method that *isn't* the merchant account provider.

@_date: 2013-11-07 23:00:32


Hmm... maybe, but they'd have to be particularly sketchy.  That would also mean there would be widespread problems withdrawing BTC.  So far it's been pretty straightforward withdrawing BTC out of CampBX (I just did it yesterday), but I suppose that *could* happen in theory, somewhere.
It *is* annoying about the Dwolla 32 day hold.. that's really just a stupid website bug they should have fixed for you by now.  I suspect your account will be back to normal once that goes away, but really it should not have happened in the first place. :/

Localbitcoins (in-person cash transaction or bank deposits) or maybe  (bank deposits).
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:46:53
Are you talking about your fees when you bought the BTC, or when transferring?  AFAIK there aren't any fees paid by you for transferring BTC out of Coinbase.  (they do pay a 0.0005 BTC transaction fee, but I think they cover it on their end)
The buy fee itself is based on whatever the price of the BTC was at the time of the buy.  e.g. log into Coinbase, click Buy/Sell, pretend you're going to buy 1 BTC.  The Coinbase fee will be 1% of the USD calculated at the time of purchase, plus $.15 for the bank fee.  This means that the Coinbase fee will always fluctuate up/down depending on what the USD/BTC was at the time of your buy.  (though it's always 1% of the buy price).
Not sure if that answers your question though..
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:59:01


Wouldn't that only apply if it was an allowable sale on Ebay?  I'm not quite why you'd think there'd be a binding contact if Ebay themselves won't enforce it.
Feel free to ask Ebay about this, of course..
You haven't mentioned *how* you're receiving payment on these auctions, but if you're using Paypal that's an additional non-contract.  But again, you could always ask Paypal directly if you're not sure.

Personally I have a spare checking account for anything connected to online accounts, including Coinbase.

No options (yet).  CampBX is planning to add ACH deposits on November 21st, so maybe keep an eye on them.
I'm curious if any others in the U.S. would add it in the future.  Offhand there's also Coinmkt, but they only do money orders or bank wire deposits thus far.
Your only other option is to just cash that out &amp; buy through Localbitcoins or bitquick.co, though you may need to do a few transactions if you're looking to do $10k worth.

Yes. 
You can email them, supposedly they might put your account on a "whitelist".  Took them 10 days to get back to me last I emailed them, so it'll be a while!  Not sure if the whitelist thing really fixes anything, someone on another thread said they still get orders canceled due to "high risk" even after they were whitelisted.

BTC-E is OK as long as you're not trying to send USD there (that's practically impossible from the U.S. aside from a large international wire transfer).
In general..
 * Coinbase (in the U.S. this is the most popular method)
 * Localbitcoins
 * bitquick.co
 * CampBX
 * Coinmkt
If you're able to do international wire transfers it might be worth taking a look at Bitstamp too (they *are* the largest exchange after all).

Coinbase is fine, but don't do the instant bank verification.  Just let it verify your bank account old-school (it'll make 2 tiny deposits to your account, you'll have to log back in after a few days to verify the two deposit amounts).
If you *do* want to do the instant bank verification anyway, temporarily change your bank website password to something else, let Coinbase verify, then change the password back to normal.

Yup I've done some trades there.  (I have them &amp; CampBX as far as U.S. exchanges go)
If you need to deposit USD they currently support money orders &amp; USD bank wires.  Incidentally they process money order deposits *way* faster than CampBX, like 3-4 business days faster.
That said, their UI/graphs are crap &amp; take forever to load.  They look nice but are painfully slow, I end up missing CampBX's ugly but fast UI by comparison.  And they're definitely small-time, not much volume.  If you think CampBX has low volume, Coinmkt's volume feels like 5-10 times lower.  Hopefully that changes in the future.
They do take the whole KYC thing way more seriously than the others, you're going to need to upload government ID, utility bills, etc. if you want to do any real trading there.  Whether that's a pro or a con?  Not sure.
@_date: 2013-09-04 17:51:46
Good question!  You should probably contact them, honestly I don't know how they go about resetting 2FA.
In theory, they could have you send them some identifying info verifying you are who you are.  This would only be possible if you already did some verification on your account.
If your account was never verified.. no idea how you'd go about proving who you are.
On the other hand, both Gox &amp; CampBX will be getting a ton of emails from iPhone authenticator owners so maybe they'll set up some sort of process for this.
@_date: 2013-09-05 18:57:43

In the U.S. CampBX is typically the cheapest in terms of fees.
There's also Coinmkt, trade fees slightly cheaper but they also charge fees on Bitcoin withdrawals, &amp; getting $$ out of there isn't quite as simple as CampBX.
If you're planning to trade in volume then you should consider Bitstamp.  Yes you'll be doing international wire transfers for USD but the trade fees will come out cheaper.

For what it's worth, those GPUs won't be worth mining BTC, but could be interesting to use for mining an altcoin (e.g. LTC).  Check out if interested.  re: bitcoin mining, if you still want to try it out as a hobby look at buying a few USB erupters.  Like the GPUs they won't ever generate their own cost to return a profit, but at least you won't be spending gobs of electricity in the process ;)
In practical terms, just buy some bitcoins via Coinbase/elsewhere whenever you can, you'll eventually build up a nice bunch of bitcoins for yourself.

I dunno, maybe they're legit but their website sure doesn't pass the scam test.
By that I mean that most/all legitimate e-commerce sites should have a listed mailing address, listed *working* phone number, as well as a listed way to contact them online (via email, form, whatever).  Bitbrew's site just has a shady form you get to fill out that probably doesn't go anywhere.  (they sent you an email receipt w/ at least an email address contact hopefully?)
But then again it's the first I heard of them so maybe I'm passing judgment too quickly.

They're probably just authorizations, meaning they'll drop off on their own.  You're technically not "charged" until your CC company bills you for the amount, e.g. when it's on your statement.

You do bring up a good point, supposedly it's much easier now for people in Japan to withdraw from MtGox.  This has definitely increased arbitrage there, which would cause MtGox's price to get closer to parity with the other exchanges.

 * Depositing USD is about the same as CampBX right now, you can mail in a USPS money order.
 * Withdrawing USD, not sure.. you can have them mail you a money order or do a domestic wire transfer I believe.
They also support OKPay/Egopay for transferring USD but those services aren't usable for users in the U.S. AFAIK.
Coinmkt is OK, though I prefer CampBX personally.  Coinmkt has a spiffy looking website but in practice the interface is way slower than CampBX, &amp; the trade volume is much much lower vs CampBX let alone the major exchanges (Bitstamp, etc.).  Coinmkt is also one of the few exchanges I've seen that charge a fee for withdrawing BTC, seems a bit weird to me (but the fee isn't particularly high).
On the plus side, Coinmkt processes USPS money order deposits much faster than CampBX.  And their support does reply to every email, usually within the same day if not 24 hours.  Unfortunately CampBX's support is almost non-existent by comparison.
I think Coinmkt does have potential, though right now I wouldn't use it as my "main" exchange.

Cowboy_Coder is right, Coinbase can push through the transaction at the original price if you ask them to review the order.  You can also ask them to "whitelist" your account for future orders, assuming they realize you're not "high risk" after all.
That's what everyone else does when they get the high risk email (discussed in other Reddit threads).  Coinbase *does* take a while to get back to you, my last email took them 10 days, but they do respond eventually.

Yeah, I've got no clue either, it's definitely *not* easy.  Maybe not even possible?  Honestly have *never* seen anyone on post a viable method of depositing USD into BTC-E from the U.S.
I do have an idea though.. from seeing another post on [bitcointalk] ( it seems you can set up a wallet on  then "top up" that wallet with USD (or RUB).  Once the QIWI wallet has funds you can deposit those funds into BTC-E as RUB (not USD), up to around $450/day.  QIWI does the USD to RUB conversion (just make sure to create both RUB &amp; USD "accounts" under your phone # there).  In the end BTC-E ends up receiving a RUB deposit from QIWI (which is one of BTC-E's supported deposit methods).
With all that said, does that even work?  In practice, not sure.  Supposedly you can link a CC at QIWI but that never worked for me, maybe QIWI doesn't support CCs from the U.S.  The other option is to go to a physical money transfer place that supports the [Contact network] ( where you can give them cash to transfer into QIWI.  Haven't been able to make that work either so no idea if that's possible  (the first time I tried the rep at the money transfer place had no idea what I was talking about re: Contact or QIWI, argh!).  Plus keep in mind when you add up all the fees it'll be like maybe 5%-6% total in fees.

They had to deal w/ the Gox seizure, are shutting down any accounts connected to Localbitcoins, etc.. at this point they may as well pull a Paypal &amp; just refuse to do anything with bitcoins.

Check your spam folder, or double-check the email address you have set up in Coinbase.  They definitely send an email when they cancel orders.
It *is* a bit frustrating.  My own order was canceled last week b/c of "high risk", waiting on their email response but I'm sure it'll be at least a week before hearing from them.
If you're in the U.S. try getting yourself set up on CampBX (you can use Dwolla or money order to deposit $$ into them).  CampBX is my usual go-to for bitcoin, they've never canceled my orders for "high risk" before.  (optional: if you want, sign up via my [referral link] ( &amp; they give you 10% discount off their commissions for the life of your account, otherwise just go to their main site

You'll find this through other posts, but if you're in the U.S. you can try Coinbase, CampBX, or Localbitcoins depending how you want to go about buying some.

Depending on your country many of these will be difficult/impossible to transfer funds with while others will be simple to use.  Transferring bitcoin itself is easy, it's the deposit/withdrawal of your USD/EUR/etc. that isn't so easy.  e.g. liquidity like AureliusM said.
Some aren't even exchanges, e.g. Coinbase is more of a bitcoin "store" where you're buying/selling directly from them.  re: the regular exchanges, you're buying/selling from others who are buying/selling BTC.
Everything also has slightly different fees.
Quickie breakdown:
 * Coinbase
 * Localbitcoins
 * bitquick.co
 * Bitstamp
 * BTC-E
 * MtGox
 * CampBX
 * Coinmkt
 * Kraken
Besides the above there are all sorts of other options for buying bitcoin ;)

Pretty sure you'd need to do a international bank wire transfer.  I don't know how many days it takes for them to credit your account..  It's almost impossible to *withdraw* USD from Gox, but maybe not impossible to deposit.
But honestly not sure why you would do this?  Since you'd be doing an international bank wire transfer anyway, why not just use a more legitimate exchange like [Bitstamp] (  You'll even *save* money since BTC is cheaper there vs Gox.

Just curious, *why* do you want to use Paypal?  Paypal means you have a bank account, or want to use a credit card via Paypal.  (or maybe you have a ton of Moneypaks)  Which is it?

Paypal + Bitcoin = Bad news.
That said, you could try the crazy Virwox method and/or BTC-E's Paypal withdraw.  Both methods will incur crazy fees on your part so it kind of depends how much $$ you're willing to lose in the conversion.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:49:09
In BTC-E "purse" is where you enter their requested details for the deposit/withdrawal you're doing.  e.g. account numbers &amp; whatnot.
I've never done BTC-E to Paypal so can't say exactly what they request you to type into that field, though from the sounds of it you may have to wait for BTC-E support to rectify your issue now.

What's the timeline?
A bank ACH transfer can take 2-5 business days, sometimes more, after which Coinbase releases bitcoin into your wallet.
However, if Coinbase cancels your transaction ("high risk") then it'll take another 2-5-something business days for the $$ to be returned to your bank account.
So, have you waited at least 5-ish business days since the transaction was canceled for your $$ to re-appear in your bank account?  Keep in mind weekends/holidays don't count.
re: your transaction codes, that's best for Coinbase support.  Try going to  log into Coinbase, click "My Cases", click "Create a new case".

When you say cashouts you're referring to withdrawing fiat out of Gox, yes?  USD, EUR, ?
Just curious, what country are you in?  What type of bank account do you have?
I'd assume you're in Japan, or maybe trolling.  Though I do remember reading about one random guy in the U.S. that claimed he always got withdrawals from Gox no problem, it's hard to believe those kind of claims when like 99% of Gox users can't get any fiat out.
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:06:00
For what it's worth, they do say they're a bitcoin *store* &amp; you could sign up to *host* a bitcoin ATM.  So the business owner doesn't actually own the ATM &amp; likely doesn't own the BTC in the ATM either.  Definitely seems like you'd be buying/selling from Bitcoiniacs.
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:25:57
Uh.. just read all the other posts.  You can't.  (or maybe, you can if you're oK waiting 6+ months for the withdrawal to actually be processed?)
You basically need to do the reverse: Buy BTC, then transfer those BTC out of Gox.  It's the only way.  It's also why the BTC price in Gox is so high, b/c everyone else needs to do the same thing &amp; this pushes the Gox price higher than everywhere else.

I imagine you'd need to get yourself set up similar to someone that handles private investments for a few clients in the non-bitcoin world.

Sounds like your Coinbase account was hacked, maybe?  Did you have 2FA enabled?  You should be looking at your bank account, they might be draining the balance down to $0.

If you actually want your money within, I dunno, 6-12 months, you should really just buy bitcoins &amp; transfer those out of Gox.

You might want to look into their available deposit methods.  From the U.S. there isn't any way to send USD there, but if you're outside the U.S. you may be able to use OKPay.
Most people tend to use BTC-E to trade between BTC &amp; altcoins, not really to send/receive fiat dollars.
@_date: 2013-09-13 13:08:25
Why not just do what all the big exchanges do?  Keep your spending bitcoins in your hot wallet, store everything else in cold storage.  Every once in a while if you need more funds just withdraw them from cold storage into your hot wallet.
The exchanges have already thought about this, IMO their servers are *way* more at risk to hacking than your own network. ;)
Doing a simple cold storage really just means you have a bitcoin address active, &amp; you can always deposit to it, but if you actually need to withdraw from it then you'd need to grab your offline wallet (on USB, etc.), open it up, then withdraw whatever funds you need out of it.  Then unplug the USB key &amp; put it away again.
This isn't anything different from what you're doing day-to-day (if you store your savings in bank accounts, etc.).  In real life most people don't carry their entire life savings in their wallet &amp; take it everywhere they go.
@_date: 2013-10-19 20:14:24
Coinbase themselves aren't an exchange or a bank, they're more like a bitcoin "store".  You don't actually deposit USD funds into them &amp; leave the USD funds sitting there.
When you buy BTC from them, what they do is initiate an ACH withdrawal directly from your linked bank account.  Same with selling, if you sell BTC they'll deposit the USD funds directly to your linked bank account.  (similar to employers' direct deposit for paychecks)
If you specifically need an exchange (e.g. similar to MtGox) then check out CampBX, Coinmkt, Bitstamp, Kraken, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:44:27
Nope, you can deposit to Coinmkt via USPS money order or domestic wire transfer.  In fact they clear money orders faster than CampBX (though CampBX clearly has way more trade volume).
It *is* funny that they added OKPay/Egopay when you can't even use those in the U.S. (them being a U.S. exchange &amp; all).
@_date: 2013-09-14 20:26:36
The other thing you can try is maybe going to another one of the seller's bank branches &amp; see if they tell you the same thing?
@_date: 2013-09-06 00:26:12
Pretty sure people would notice the lack of liquidity long before all the bitcoins are bought up, via increasing value of BTC.  Of course, there are plenty of people that will just hold onto them regardless of short-term price, so buying *everything* may not be possible.  Over 50% of the market?  Maybe, but it'd be expensive!
If the price gets forced up like that then general day-to-day transactions would end up being done in mBTC, or who knows, maybe even smaller ;)  The general transactions would still be business as usual in that sense.
What would be the end goal here?  If the U.S. government (or any government) wanted to take down bitcoin it'd be far cheaper for them to attack the network rather than attempt to buy up all the coins.  It'd be a bit similar to how ISPs/colleges/organizations currently attempt to block or severely limit bittorrent bandwidth.  Of course being the government they'd have vast resources beyond what even one ISP can do (e.g. straight up outlaw BTC, force ISPS to attempt to block BTC traffic, life in prison if you're caught with a BTC wallet, you get the idea).  Does make me wonder if China will ever attempt to firewall bitcoin.

None of the bitcoin exchanges accept debit/credit cards.  You could check out  or  just be prepared for high fees.

Try  (they used Square Cash which links to your debit card)
Is this a debit card for a bank account?  If you're in the U.S. it's really easy to link up your bank account to Coinbase to buy/sell bitcoin.  Or    if you use your debit card to withdraw cash &amp; then do a cash transaction.

They are different wallets, they don't sync up together.  However, you could send bitcoins from your bitcoin-qt wallet to your blockchain wallet.  And vice versa.  (assuming you have bitcoins in either wallet right now)


Don't.  Your laptop will likely be dead long before you ever manage to mine anything on it.  Bitcoin mining has moved on from CPU &amp; GPU.  Currently you'd need a very expensive ASIC (think at least $5000) to even get in the mining game, &amp; even then it's very risky to assume you'd even break even let alone mine a profit.
 Since you're probably going to ask "how to get bitcoins", check out the sidebar on your right to get you started --&gt;

Depends on your bank's policies.  What happens when you attempt to transfer out more than you have in your account?

Yes, but I'd also want the apps to update through Google Play.  Not sure what the middle ground is, maybe build out an internal extension/service that apps can use to accept bitcoin for upgrading to paid versions?
Maybe a separate app store might be workable, assuming the apps are still being updated (e.g. that's one of Amazon's problems, the apps don't always update at the same time Play store apps update).
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:40:14
It might be worth it if you're looking to put in significant capital into trying to buy ASICs?  If you're asking b/c you have a spare computer, GPU, etc. then the answer is no, it won't be worth mining.
You should check out particularly the sidebar info.
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:49:01
Coinbase is great, but it's kind of a toss-up on how long they'll take to transmit transactions out to the network.  They're OK as long as you're not in a rush to do a transaction.  If you need to do a quick in-person bitcoin transaction Coinbase may not be the best option *unless* that person/store/merchant is also using Coinbase.  (Coinbase to Coinbase transactions happen instantly AFAIK)
MtGox isn't even designed to be a usable bitcoin wallet so not sure why you'd compare them here, they'd be even worse than Coinbase.
A desktop wallet or even the Android bitcoin wallet will likely transmit bitcoin faster than Coinbase, but it's at a small cost of convenience so you'd want to weigh out your options.

These suggestions all assume you're in the U.S. of course.
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:34:24
Yes, but they only charge the CC as a backup in case the ACH withdrawal from your bank does not go though.  Normally instant purchases will still be charged to your bank account.
So you still need to add &amp; verify a bank account to do any transactions on Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:46:09
In short: Don't bother mentioning it to them anymore, eventually they'll come around on their own if they like.
Kind of a tricky thing, I don't usually talk about bitcoin unless it somehow comes  up in conversation, &amp; even then I don't really spend much time trying to get people to buy/not buy bitcoin.  In general people will make their own decisions when they're comfortable with it, otherwise they tend to not be too into receiving investment advice.  (esp if you're not already a banker/broker/etc!)
It's kind of like hearing from someone "Hey, you should really buy some Twitter stock, it's gonna be huge OMG!!!", you might disregard the first time but then the 2nd or 3rd time you're going to think they're just crazy. ;)

@_date: 2013-10-18 21:41:30
What country?
In the U.S. check out CampBX, Coinmkt, or Kraken.  The first two do USPS money order deposits while Kraken only does wire transfers.  (honestly if you're going to do wire transfers stick w/ Bitstamp, they have much higher volume than any of the U.S. exchanges!)
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:33:51
In the U.S. Coinmkt is also an option (money order deposits or bank wire), though right now their trade volume is very low (lower than CampBX, which is saying a lot!)
@_date: 2013-08-30 17:03:07
PP is never the one left holding the bag.  If there's a CC chargeback they *will* take the $$ out of the seller's account.
Best practice (if you actually do sell w/ PP) is to connect a separate checking account to your PP, &amp; immediately withdraw any sales $$ from PP &amp; the checking account.  At least that's how I do it, then again I've been limited a few times so what do I know ;)
@_date: 2013-10-08 19:46:03
Some banks are just extra-careful w/ certain transactions &amp; tend to always mark them as fraud, especially charges in foreign countries.  I get that a lot with BoA credit cards (not with Bitcoin, just random purchases).  Not much you can do about that beyond calling the bank &amp; telling them it's not fraudulent.  Or maybe getting a different bank/CC for that?
Though to be honest you're better off buying bitcoins using other methods (e.g. in the U.S. try Coinbase, CampBX, or Localbitcoins).
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:24:48
Offhand seems like Localbitcoins would be your best bet (if the sellers are near you).  Or set yourself up w/ Bitstamp (but that'd require SEPA transfer).
Maybe someone in Ireland can give you more specific advice!

@_date: 2013-11-19 23:57:38
It's a different system.. for every buy you make at Coinbase you're really initiating an ACH withdrawal from your bank.  U.S. bank ACH withdrawals take 2-5 business days to clear, that's really the U.S. banking system not a Coinbase issue.  The "hold" period is really to make sure the $$ actually comes through for your Coinbase BTC purchase.
With CampBX, they already have your $$ since you have to deposit funds *before* even attempting to buy any BTC.   Since they already have your funds the BTC purchase itself is "instant".
@_date: 2013-09-24 19:48:04
Does your bank also charge a fee?  Could be that.
Otherwise not sure, you're correct that their site claims a 1500 Yen wire deposit fee.

From outside the U.S. many people seem to use OKPay.
From within the U.S...  no idea, I've never figured that one out myself.  You *can* do a international wire deposit if you're looking to trade a large-ish amount ($2000 minimum, 1% fee, $20 minimum fee).
BTC-E is often used for trading BTC for altcoins, or vice versa, so there's always that.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:46:46


No.  Some people have said *maybe* on Ebay, but you're really just asking to be scammed if you go that route.  (either Ebay or Paypal will want to cancel that transaction, assuming the buyer/seller aren't trying to scam)

re: the email coming from Coinbase, unless you have some sort of payment button, I think(?) the sender needs to be logged into Coinbase to do a "Request Money" to an email address.

Was it August 21st that you initiated the Dwolla deposit?  Yeah, that should've cleared long before Dwolla discontinued services to CampBX, etc, in October.  I suspect there's some sort of bug on their website w/ that old Dwolla countdown.
Now, of course, you're not going to be able to get anything to/from Dwolla &amp; CampBX.
Try posting a message on their FB page &amp; see if that gets you anywhere (heard that worked for some other users).  While I haven't had any issues w/ CampBX myself, it does sound like their support is lacking :/
@_date: 2013-10-11 23:03:07
Probably not in 2013.  A conservative estimate of 3-6 months maybe?  Some people have actually been waiting for even longer than that..
If you need that withdrawal sooner you really should just buy BTC &amp; transfer that out of Gox.  Yes, you'll be paying Gox rates, but then again that's why the Gox price is so high in the first place.
That's discussed in other threads already

I know this might sound crazy, but what about opening a new Visa CC account with whoever, make sure the name/billing address on that account is correct, then link that to Coinbase?  See if that works?  Worst case scenario, you can just close that CC account if Coinbase couldn't verify it &amp; you don't need it.
It would be better if Coinbase fixed or expanded their CC verification options, but for now that's all I can think of :/

The billing address is for the credit card verification.  When you add a VISA CC it'll verify the card by doing two small test transactions, which will also verify the billing address associated for the CC.
You don't need to add a billing address if you're not adding a CC for instant buys on Coinbase.

Nope.  Dwolla dropped all support for virtual currencies (including bitcoin) so there's no support between them &amp; CampBX at this point.

They don't look legit IMO, but to be fair I haven't read of anyone using them successfully (or being scammed by them).
You might eventually want to pose an update, just so others know if they're actually legit or not :)

10 BTC?  Wow that sucks.  Doubt Paypal is going to help you out, but you can try &amp; hope for the best.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:20:50
Yup, Bitcoinstore / Memorydealers is legit.  They might've been one of the first online stores accepting bitcoin (I think).

There's some really sketchy mining contracts on Ebay, I wouldn't trust any of them.  This one is somewhat entertaining
(though I suspect those *have* to be fake bids to bring the price up?)

No, Coinbase purchases are done through U.S. bank checking accounts.  They do charge the VISA cc as a backup, but only if something went wrong with withdrawing funds from the checking account.
For CC purchases try  or  though you'll notice their prices are much higher due to credit card fraud.  Most people would not buy bitcoin with a credit card/Paypal, best to avoid unless necessary.

You can definitely have the same private key for a bitcoin address &amp; a litecoin address.  But they wouldn't be the same public address for receiving coins (I think).  Or maybe it's possible if you purposely create an address that way, I'm not clear on that part to be honest.

Lets just say updating to the *latest* version of Bitcoin-qt will solve this problem. :)

Not sure *why*, but it does seem that MtGox is requiring verification for bitcoin withdrawals.  So.. better get going on that verification process!
@_date: 2013-10-29 20:31:22
Worked for me a few days ago, not sure if something went wrong in the last 24 hours though.

You sell bitcoins.  Hard to give you any recommendations w/o knowing your country, but offhand Localbitcoins can be used almost anywhere.
@_date: 2013-09-11 22:10:55
None of the exchanges accept credit cards.
[btcquick] ( does accept CC for bitcoin, just plan on paying a huge premium for the privilege.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:17:48


Yup, you could do that.
I'm in the U.S. so I mostly avoid using MtGox nowadays, but yeah some people will use MtGox the way you describe.
If you're doing a fair amount of trading you should consider Bitstamp too, you could at least get USD in/out of there from the U.S. (via international wire transfer).
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:06:28
If they have a withdraw fee then yes, you will be charged a withdraw fee.  (I think Cryptsy has a 0.0002 BTC withdraw fee)

MtGox should be OK if you're outside the U.S., apparently they have been processing wire transfers &amp; SEPA for users outside the U.S. (according to other redditors).
If you're in the U.S., don't bother, you're never going to get a USD wire transfer out of them.
There's a bunch of other places you can use if you're in the U.S., not sure why you'd bother with MtGox?
 * Coinbase
 * 
 * Localbitcoins
 * CampBX
 * Coinmkt
 * Kraken
 * Bitstamp

Funny, I keep reading that &amp; yet have not seen anyone with a bank in Japan post anything on Reddit to verify this claim.  Maybe we just don't have a lot of Japanese users on this Reddit?

Nah, I wouldn't say it'll be that bad.  You can still mail USPS money orders no problem.  The irony is that the money order will probably clear faster than Dwolla anyway.
The whole Deposit to Dwolla --&gt; Wait for Dwolla to clear your deposit --&gt;  Transfer to CampbX  was always such a weird artificial waiting period.
