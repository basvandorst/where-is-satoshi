Tbh if Amazon started accepting BTC it value would be 5000$ at least and the butthurt from VISA/PayPal would be huge, so huge that there could only be 2 outcomes : 1. Start accepting BTC 
2. Go 404

No problems,this was dedicated to people who create threads like "Bitstamp hacked" while they don't even know what a phishing site is. 
Making something good is easy, explaining it to the dumb people(You) out there is hard.

Nobody is bragging, i'm just stating that people don't know what they are doing on their PCs and then cry like babies when they lose their coins.
There is nothing wrong with Windows(except it has a couple of backdoors) but I believe NSA has more important things to develop than reading what a guy on reddit is doing.

Yes I agree that BTC has to be "idiot proof" but those "idiots" blame companies and exchange sites due to their mistakes and that is making BTC look like some back alley midnight drug market with DEA spying 24/7 on it currency.

Reversing Secrets of Reverse Engineering is a good book which goes in depth about executables and malware analysis

I understand your concern about my virtual money but trust me, Its you who gave "hacker" that information, not Bitstamp (lets take them for example) -&gt; It takes literally 2 seconds to click the A4 paper icon next to url to check if its a phishing or not. Besides that, Bitstamp has SSL.. One has to be blind not to notice that

No, something like a directX dll injected into another executable. This gives people very good idea how malware can work and PE in general.
I doubt many BTC users know that executables load DLLs

XSS is easy to see since URL is miles long.

Nope, back then I had ~ 11 BTC but I spent them on hosting and dedicated servers instead :D. There were moments where I was tempted to buy couple of 5 GH/s miners tho.
