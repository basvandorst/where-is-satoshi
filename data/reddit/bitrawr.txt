That's a really great question. We are actually going to be in contact with all of the ATM providers and they will be sending us real-time data showing that the ATM is online and operational. We'll also have comments and ratings for users to vet the specific ATM location. On top of that we will have the option for business owners to add their blip onto the map. 
I'd love to hear some of your ideas. Can you send an email to alon

Thank you so much! Mobile does need some more optimization and work. We also plan to add price charts, developer resources, merchant points on the map. Your feedback is &lt;3

Highly recommend the Ledger Nano S. The new model "Ledger Nano X" is also pretty nifty coming with a larger screen and Bluetooth connectivity. You can compare the two models in this guide [

You'd need to contact a business owner that would like to host an ATM, as well as a Bitcoin ATM Operator to provide the service. You can start by reading this blog post.
