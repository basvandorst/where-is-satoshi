@_date: 2017-12-18 01:28:41

@_date: 2017-12-12 22:27:05

Hahahha ;) it's still pretty funny... it's as if the euro is zimbabwen dollar and bitcoin is euro.
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:07:58

@_date: 2018-06-10 09:31:22
Nah fam, coz liek u reinvest in bitconnsss, BITCONNNSSSS!!
@_date: 2018-06-22 07:31:18
"Here are your 5bitcoins sir"
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:03:35
Nah, fuck coinbase. Couldn't make an account for months with them, with kraken made one in 5minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:07:29
I think it's in the name.
A coin is... a coin... it's more difficult to imagine buying 0.1 of a coin...
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:35:15
I think there is too much hype amongst not just the closed circle, but also regularRpeople, for it to crash anytime soon.
I think if it crashes, itll happen in mid 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:27:53
By reducing anxiety I used to watch threads about Bitcoin and I always knew I should invest but coinbase gave me a lot of verification problems and so it dragged on 4 month and even now I don't have a coinbase account but with Kraken I had zero issues and had one set up in a matter of half an hour.

"Look at meeee, I'm mister bitttcoiinnn."
"Hey, could you reach 10k euro before 2018?"
"Ooooo weeeee, caann dooo!"
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:19:18
No... *shakes his head* no... for your name is josh, and you buy only when it tops xD

@_date: 2017-11-20 23:37:25
What... does that mean? "Futures"?
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:19:13
...unless you didn't hodl and kissed the shotgun, for frustrations... then you're really out..
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:06:29
Well, baseless is a strong word. I prefer... temporary. The difference in the why. One group, holds due to their understanding of the technology, and their interpretation of its meaning for the future. Another, holds because... the bandwagon.
One of those groups will, indeed, jump off of it once the going gets rough. Like a girl in whos ear you just whispered... i got hiv... versus the girl who whispers back... the same thing :).

@_date: 2018-04-17 10:45:41
Fuck the current financial system, hope usd collapses. Bitcoin is not gonna change the world, it already changing it.

Oh. Hmmm, curious
@_date: 2018-04-19 00:06:10
Fight the powerrr
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:56:25
But... it kind of makes no sense... like, nobody uses it, and adoption is amazing towards bitcoin... s like, it seems like bcash is very much an altcoin if we look at usage... 
In a way i feel bad for bcash.
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:16:46
Calm down edgelord
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:26:11

Hmmm, so lets sayyy economy one is 100 strength and has 10 bank notes circulating. Economy 2 is 200 strong, but has 20 bank notes circulating.
In this simplified version, would economy 1 bank note equal 1 economy 2 bank note?
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:34:59
