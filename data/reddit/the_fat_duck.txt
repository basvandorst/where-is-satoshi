Not sure about that, when I die nobody will pay for the safe deposit box, so the bank would probably just drill it out and steal anything inside. They wouldn't care about my potted plants to, but whoever does deserves to inherit my portfolio.

Who says you can't decentralize it? Hide it in your house and in other peoples homes too. Hide it in books, memorize which books and which page the word is on. 12/24 word seeds are supposed to be hidden in cleaver places.

Well, you could easily heat up all the water you need, even with a small rig. Most of the heat will be lost anyway. That'll be the cheapest solution as you'll need only some pipes and a huge fan. The more efficient solution would be a water cooled rig, but that's also expensive to build, even if you loose less of the heat.

Looks like a scene from Venezuela, tones of fiat bills all over the floor but no one seems to bother picking them up. A few years ago there would have been a huge fight over those bills, guess people realize how worthless fiat has become.

That's literally the definition of charity tho, wouldn't be charity if you'd made profit from it right? I've seen enough "charity" organizations with bosses taking out million dollar salaries, using volunteer labor and bullying their volunteers who decide to help others than the organizations main target. That's why I stopped donating to the mainstream "charity" organizations.

The irony is that more transparency is the obvious way to make money laundering and corruption harder and more expensive. Yet these banker guys always seems to want less transparency, hmm.
