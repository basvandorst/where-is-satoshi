Was unaware of those facts, however, because the place of contracting, the place of performance, the "physical" location of the bitcoins supposedly being in Japan. I would say that doesn't matter too much from a contract standpoint. 
As far as being registered with Fincen, I don't think that effects their liability to its customers regarding jurisdiction on a contractual claim. The only way any of us are getting into a Fed Ct is with Diversity Jurisdiction, and because there's an adequate forum in Japan, Fed courts will punt. Del state law is awesome, but would likely punt to Japan on any contract issue brought to its courts.

I don't think there is anywhere else to discuss it, I just feel bad that your post and likeminded posts are getting down voted to shit, because that can't make you feel good. At the same time I understand why these posts are being down-voted. People inherently have a limited ability to empathize with things they cannot see personally. 
Maybe send a message to the mods and see if they'll mind setting up a sub, or at least stickied grievance post. Or maybe set one up yourself and crosspost here. I bet it would get to the top because both sides would likely support it.

I have $ invested in Bitcoin, so Im certainly not a hater, but seeing that Amex teamed up with apple for their new payment system makes clear why Apple was keeping bitcoin off IOS. They have the market reach, the infrastructure, and the marketing to crush crypto currency. 
It completely eliminates the ease of payment benefit from bitcoin, and leaves only the decentralized argument and the processing fees argument, which normal consumers don't give a fuck about. 
I'm not saying BTC is dead in the water by any means, but to say that apple wallet is not going to be a big deal is a travesty. Droid needs to incorporate bitcoin.

Coinbase is based in the U.S. I am an american citizen. As far as I know, they are the only established exchange ("brokerage") based in the U.S. That fact alone subjects Coinbase to jurisdiction that I can access if they were to breach their user agreement (which I have gone through). Gox is a good example as to why this matters. 
Thus, they are valuable to me. However, I can be frustrated with a feature that I don't like about their service, and post a question asking if their is a legitimate reason for these hikes. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:17:12
While I think economically speaking price should go down, because BTC price is so related to good/bad news and a consumer confidence... I think Gox refunding customers would have a positive effect on the market.

Preach. 
(the only counter argument I can make is that institutional investors that aren't in the baking inner circle have staked interest in BTC succeeding and will hopefully fight against big banks protocol, though they can't stop the destabilization of Bitcoin, the biggest hope we have is that a bunch of investors hop on SecondMarket when it opens, which is specifically designed for large institutional investors... we lose most control of the market that way, but the functionality and core values of BTC will remain the same.)

Upvote for your opinion. I was/am speaking towards average US/First world consumer adoption.  I just think ease of payment was "the thing" that was supposed to be the selling point for normal consumers. 
As for your other points, 
1. let's not pretend that Bitcoin has a security image problem towards the average consumer. All they know right now is how the CEO of bitcoin mismanaged money and over half a billion dollars was "stolen." Apple (Apart from this most recent I-cloud thing) has a generally great reputation for quality and security amongst average consumers. 
2. Faster- Apple wallet will be faster. They won't need multiple confirmations from the block chain to ensure payment. 
3. Censor proof- True. But. The average consumer doesn't seem to care too much about it. 
4. Global: apple &amp; amex are also global
5. No barriers to entry. Yes. For commercial use bitcoin beats apple here no question about it. for consumer use. How hard was it to buy your first bitcoin? 
Now then, as for the "it's going to take off in the third world, and then supposedly gain market adoption in the first world." That could happen, and it if it does it will be both revolutionary and unprecedented. I believe in Bitcoin so I believe there is a chance. However, that's not the way history usually works, and I don't think it's naive to say that history may repeat itself. Usually, the First World gets the fancy new toys, and then companies shift focus to emerging markets. A trickle down effect if you will. The third world nations that we want to adopt bitcoin first need to put a reliable infrastructure of a secure internet and cheap smart phones. 
Bitcoin cannot survive in the long term if it gets thought of as obsolete in the short term. 
The real hope that Bitcoin has is that there is some money behind it. People are lobbying for it, and people who are smart see the opportunity in it. Those people need to not give up. (or Google could back it)

Yeah buddy.... this is majorly wrong. Every hour the line completely changes. At 11:30 it said the price was supposed to be 627 at 1:00. Now. at 12:00, it says the price is going to be 640 at 1:00.

You did great Charlie. I think the professional opening about collaboration really legitimized the criticism you gave of the article. It's important not to radicalize your opponents actions to the point where you look like the type of person she was describing ("someone wed to the idea of Satoshi remaining anonymous"). I also like that you didn't get too far into the emotional aspects or damage done to Dorian as the result of her poor journalism, but kept an analytical framework in breaking down her process. 
As far as defending questions about your case, I think you've rehearsed that well enough to not need feedback. I also think the continued emphasis on the value of Bitcoin not coming from "whatever others are willing to pay for it" but rather on the technological innovation should be the narrative given any time when confronted with a question like that. 
My only suggestion, and some may disagree, is that when you get excited or impassioned by what is asked, or what you are trying to get across, your voice pitch heightens and it is easy to tell that your are heavily emotionally invested in Bitcoin. Now, anyone who knows anything about you will know that is obviously the case, and why should you hide it right? But. By appearing that way you seem inherently less objective(if only slightly), which can allow the other side to dismiss your points as biased.  
But, honestly, you rock!

Whether the comments are biased, the news will show up here pretty close to first. So as far as keeping up with news, here is as good as a place as any. If you wan't to have intelligent non-biased discussion about BTC, you're not going to find it very often anywhere. The media  (aside from Bloomberg) did a really terrible job with it, which has provoked an equal response in the opposite direction from BTCers. Including myself at times.  
Bloomberg is a pretty good news source. I was happy with their approach, brought on experts from both sides etc.

This would get more views if posted under a title that actually gives the reader any idea of what the article is about. There are so many spam posts with similar titles that most readers won't pay attention to a post with that title. 
The content of the post details private insurance company  which will begin insuring Bit-Coin, something that the community may get excited about. Thus, there doesn't need to be a Gimmick to attract views. Name it something like "Inscrypto: Private Insurance for Bit-Coin may lead to Boom." 
Also, as far as the company goes. I'm not sure if the community is already aware of Incrypto, but the problem with Private insurance companies is, you need to believe that they'll actually pay you when shit hits the fan. 
People buy car insurance because they have to, get health insurance because it usually come's with their job (and now they have too under Obamacare) and a lot more would roll the dice if insurance wasn't a real choice. 
I used to be for Private-Insurance for BTC as a game changer, but the more I think about it, it seems like those Afflack supplementary health plans. Some will buy, most will probably roll the dice with a trusted wallet/exchange. What is imperative for even that to succeed however, is a large company with a huge amount of capital that people can sue if they don't get their claim paid. I'll have to take a closer look at this company's model for decentralized insurance, but... for now I'm skeptical.

If you stop viewing it as a way to make money, but rather a way to save money if mainstream adoption were to occur (transmittance fees/convenience/tax shelter(if you're into it), then you can immediately see that it has intrinsic value. The problem is that people who truly believe in it pitch it as a money making scheme to get others on board, as well as speculators speculating to try to make money. It needed slow growth, but it gained attention too fast. Now we have to deal with the growing pains, which might end up killing the currency. 
Further, if that is your only definition as to why it is a scam, all currency is a scam. All currency needs trust and newcomers and widespread acceptance for value. If not it's just a promissory note. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:32:53
SEC does not have and will not have jurisdiction over Bitcoin, Federal judge has ruled it a currency and that is the standing precedent as of now(at least in that region), SCOTUS would have to rule on it for it to be binding on the nation. OR, Congress would have to do some regulatory magic to put SEC in charge of regulating BTC. 
However, Bitcoin derivatives/futures (when they're developed and ready to go) and what not may meet the criteria of an investment contract under SEC... Who knows...  
TLDR/TIL; Its a regulatory nightmare and I appreciate that Ben Lawsky is spearheading the operation (at least for New York)

Sure. The price has been trending downwards since a big crash in December. Then, in late January/early February, Mt. Gox (the largest exchange at the time) became insolvent. This also effected the price negatively. It also really attracted the media's attention. Bitcoin is no longer niche, everyone knows about it. However, the media has not portrayed Bitcoin in the most positive light. People argue (and I agree) that most people reporting on the subject did not understand the basics of Bitcoin, but knew the topic was trending so they reported on it (See stories like "Bitcoin Bankrupt"). These media outlets would then ask guests on their show to comment on Bitcoin, and most traditional economists and investors are bearish on BTC (for legitimate reasons or not). Thus, the general consumer outlook on BTC is not really positive right now, and adoption has slowed. Also, because new BTC are constantly being pushed into the market, supply is up and demand is down, you're going to have a downwards trend until one of those changes. (Also, when BTC began receiving a lot of attention, a lot of capital got spent investing in BTC startups, capital that might have been pushed into the market instead, but long term this was for the better.)
Additionally, the continuing uncertainty about how Countries will regulate BTC has caused (and accelerated) the price drop. For Americans, the IRS recently stated that BTC is property for tax purposes (reporting requirements are no fun for anyone). The downwards trend continues. 
Why April 15th? China. Chinese investors really took to BTC. They have been pumping the market with capital for a while. For the last few months, there have been numerous rumors that the Chinese Govt is going to ban bitcoin causing flash drops in price. Most recently, news reports of a "leaked" memo from the People's Bank of China (PBOC), stated that effective April 15, banks and payment companies must close all the accounts opened by the operators of websites that trade Bitcoin. The Chinese market has panicked from this news and has been dumping Bitcoin which has triggered panic sells from investors around the world (the reason for the price drop from 680 to 450 in less than a week). The validity of this memo is unknown. No trading companies have verified its authenticity, and some have denied the truth of the memo. Whether the memo is true or not, it has carried enough weight that mass selling of BTC has been occurring for the last week. Personally, I'm not like the rest of the sub here which outwardly denies the truth of the memo. Certain Chinese exchanges have been making changes to the way they operate, the PBOC has not commented on the issue, and it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if China did payment processors from dealing with BTC exchanges. Either way, uncertainty has been continuous, and as people begin to panic more and more as we get closer and closer to April 15th, the price will continue to sink (barring really good news elsewhere, or an early positive announcement by the PBOC). 
On April 15th, if no announcement is made by the PBOC (though you would think we would know sooner because there should be a notice provision in their banking agreement for termination, but I don't know Chinese law... If there is a notice provision it's probably 14 or 7 days... so if on April 2nd or April 8th you see flash sales by the Chinese, that's not a good sign), and the exchanges bank accounts are still operational, I would suspect the market will rebound to some degree quite quickly because may will regard the memo as bullshit. However, the uncertainty will continue until China takes an official stance on BTC and lays out clear guidelines for Chinese traders. 
That was a really long winded response just for you my friend. So I hope you enjoyed it.

That wouldn't be a bad PR move. I'll look into them. We would absolutely need to verify IDs for this (At least I would need to verify my ID to all of you), and a contract would need to be signed.

Might be, college kids aren't the ones buying bitcoin right now. I'd take time to learn more about bitcoin in your free time. No one is going to figure out how to bill bitcoin right besides a lawyer that figures it out through research, trial and error. You might be one of the first lawyers to do it, or do it right. I don't know of any in the NYC area that have started to try to figure it out. 
I don't think a traditional model would be most efficient. You'll have to upcharge your clients for the transaction fees (so BTC will be more expensive for them than regular cash), and in the worst case scenario may have to bill them again if the market drops. I think it's going to take some time for us to figure out how to bill Bitcoin correctly.
One thing I will say, if you believe in Bitcoin, then consider billing and holding BTC as a pet project/pro-bono opportunity. If Bitcoin continues to do well, you're essentially rewarding yourself for not cashing out as soon as you're paid. 
Don't take on huge clients that want to pay all in bitcoin (though I doubt that will be an issue), take on small ones that need small things done.
Advertise that you accept Bitcoin, learn as much as you can in the mean time, and keep us all updated on how you do it haha!

OP, I should just send you a pm. I was huge into Bitcoin a few years ago. Sold all of it because I had to in order to afford a security deposit on an apartment (nyc). I'm less into it now. I'm not sure if questions like this come up often and that's why you're getting so much blowback or what have you, but your question is obviously legitimate and the circle jerk that appears to be going on in this sub has been this way for a long time. To give a legitimate response, it's hard, about as hard as opening a new bank account at one of the major banks. That's a problem. People customarily accrue money before ever needing to open a bank account, which provides the incentive to go through the hassle to get a bank account. Here it's the opposite. Right now there's not much you can do. Maybe it will change. Maybe it won't. A ton of Bitcoins value comes from speculators not from actual use as a fiat, thats a bigger problem. Unless there is a policy shift, it's going to be this way for a while.
