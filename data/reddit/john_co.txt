If you let an "old" node sync it will follow BTC Bitcoin rather than BCH Bitcoin Cash chain.

Why?  It seems like reducing/increasing future BTC creation is the same thing, just a matter of +/- in the code, right?  What makes one different from the other in terms of one being a possible soft fork?

So Bob Smith has 100 BTC in cold storage and missed the memo about the "5 year rule" and now lost a fortune.  And there's probably a lot of people in the same boat.  That seems like a bad idea just by this one example.

Scam: a dishonest scheme; a fraud.
It is a scam though, because that site likely leads some people to believe it is the site of Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash.  It is dishonest.  Why not use bitcoincash.com?
