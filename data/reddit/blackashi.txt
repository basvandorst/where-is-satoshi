Some people actually like to drive their cars. not saying it as a sassy diss but a tesla's driving experience falls off pretty quickly unless you can afford a p100d and even then, all you're good for is your ludicrous launches.

The current administration isn't the brightest. They've been repealing things that make a lot of sense all year

Ohh, here's one. Store your 26 seed word in plain sight, but add in 2 random words at positions you know and are easily memorizable.

in the next 5 years, whats a reasonable top and bottom estimate at which bitcoin could x% increase by and still be stable/not disrupt the world economy or common sense?

My boss is great but I wouldn't want him knowing how much wealth/loss I really have. That's almost never good when it comes to time to get a salary bump
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:10:02
Thanks for a realistic answer!

The more time 'they' wait the hard it's going to get with institutions and everyone's grandma getting in. Only a matter of time before someone wants stuff like this regulated
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:13:57
(i don't understand sorry) are you saying no one will risk doing this because it could introduce a huge bug?
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:34:15
why do forks happen? Like how/why is currency/money just created ?

Hey, you know your shit. Why is bitcoin king? Why won't there be like 40 equally great cryptos? Also the major solution everyone wants to solve with bitcoin is transaction times. at 1% adoption rate, won't this mean a loooong time to confirm transactions?

someone just said gdax doesn't clear until 5 days, and the price isn't locked in. This doesn't sound like good advice (based on ^^). Is it true?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:14:44
PAUSE, so no one knows who he is in real life?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:08:56
learnt this with robinhood, decent training for crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:17:06
If the stock market crashes, i believe crypto will skyrocket.

Think of it like this, if you had four hundred million dollars and you wanted to transfer to someone would you trust the ach to go without a hitch? These people have a accountants bankers and workers dedicated to doing jobs like transfers.

You realize "just have more money" isn't a solution right.
