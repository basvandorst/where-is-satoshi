So we're glorifying scammers here?
  
The real satoshi lmao

all bank deposits in eu are insured up to 100k
this is just one company that holds both bank account and exchange account for you
and result is the same. you have to trade on the exchange and if you want to spend it, you have to put it to your bank. bitwalla just simplifies this process.
@_date: 2019-08-31 07:18:38
this is good. you didn't really think a few hodlers will take down the whole financial world ?
@_date: 2019-10-06 07:24:59
not sure in India, but in EU all bank deposits are secured up to 100k.

it creates a black hole and all bitcoins are gone
just like a real life economy, it's gone, it's all gone.
@_date: 2019-06-16 00:12:41
it's like any other gambling, probability and risk/reward ratio.

Are you dumb or just trolling? Sorry, shouldn't speak like that to mentally disabled people. Carry on little one.
@_date: 2019-04-13 10:06:18
idk who that is but i call bullshit
@_date: 2019-04-28 06:53:47
OR WHAT ?
@_date: 2019-04-20 09:56:46
should have anchored in international waters
@_date: 2019-04-28 06:52:36
so they all work like this, yeah? first you need to register online, complete the KYC and then use these?
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:42:29
Bitcoin is not inflationary currency.
  
By that logic it should be worth about 1.34$ by now.
@_date: 2019-04-13 07:48:05
What, is there a notion that Satoshi is back? Or known? Because he's not lmao.
@_date: 2019-09-22 07:55:16
Do you need kyc to buy at these?
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:08:40
leverage for one
@_date: 2019-09-29 08:34:28
i am sorry, what ? forget the nakamoto part, but wtf was this event?
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:23:01
that's a weird flex to buy 2 BTC but yeah, cannot withdraw crypto from skrill. they only act as an exchange. with 1.5% trading fee. it's ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:31:14
i have no idea how they hold the coins but given the fact that you cannot withdraw it, and if you want to keep it, i'd get the funds off via bank and purchase btc elsewhere, where you can withdraw
crypto exchanges have fees around 0.10% - 0.2% ... even 1% seems high
unless you're laundering money, in which case ... carry on :)
