I'm guessing that's /s. I don't get the hostility around here. Nothing wrong with differing opinions. Wish you the best in your endeavors :)

Nope, just a bad investment for anyone who doesn't use most government services and programs, like myself. :)

You're trying really hard to put words in my mouth. Nothing wrong with trying to better society, however I believe the more of their own wealth people control, the more they will give back. Could be because I'm a Christian, but whatever. The government has no obligation to improve society, just to maintain it, and allow innovators to improve it for ourselves. And the tax rate in EU countries is just so absurd you might as well be an employee of the queen.

Should've clarified, 450% on what I've cashed out on.

Well, I'd rather pay for my own than have the government take half of all my income and give me back some for education.

Key word in my comment- "Most". Private school and actually have a driver's license with a motorcycle endorsement but that's irrelevant. I also live in a major city so off there too. If you think that people need to pay the insane taxes that they do in Europe just to have a PD, court system, and some poorly maintained roads, you must've done the math wrong. :) Taxes are great to an extent, I just think they've gone overboard in Europe. To each their own though.

Eh I've become able to pay my own 4 year tuition fully at a state school through crypto so I'm happy :) arrogance or not, I realize wont last forever.

Being in a leadership position at my universities student-ran investment firm, which strives for total net of 9% I feel this on a personal level. I now scoff at &lt;300% returns haha
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:59:33
Oh I understand the difference fully, I'm just saying it's hard fighting for 9% when I've made ~450% on my own in crypto. There is undoubtedly more underlying value in stocks than bitcoin. What can I say I'm a gambler ha. Not the leader either, but the VP :)

Of course not. I'm happy with what I pay and what I get. Since I don't use many gov programs, I choose to live in the country with the lower taxes. Personal preference.

Thank you very much, there was too much there I got confused.

1350-1400 I think we have been overpriced for a while now, sadly.
