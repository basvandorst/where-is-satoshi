There's an Intel hardware bug that [was recently discovered]( and there's a lot of speculation about it specifically regarding the crazy privilege elevation that may be possible. For example, a VM being able to take over threads running on its host.

Consider donating to Baltimore's [Book Thing]( a charity dedicated to giving out free books. It does not have a BTC donation address but I'm sure they would be _more_ than happy to set up a wallet for a donation.

So does "have to create a new wallet" mean I need to transfer from the old to the new, and pay ~200sat/byte to do it?

This is the part that I'm confused about. There has to be _some_ fee, right? The transactions involving Coinbase had to be "settlement" transactions, right? So wouldn't a miner's fee be required? But the payments were instantaneous and _exact_! 
Could somebody (break this down, each transaction at a time, explaining what exactly happened? I think this is totally awesome but I am mystified.

That helps a lot. So this sort of works as an intermediary between Coinbase &amp; Lightning. 
Coinbase &lt;--&gt; LightningRamp's Coinbase Account = instant and free
LightningRamp's Lightning Node &lt;--&gt; Other Lightning Node = instant and free(ish?)
So, since lightningramp is connected to both, lightningramp serves as a way to liaise funds between the two. Unless there's something I'm not seeing, though, doesn't this require a measure of trust, though? We'd need to trust you to move money on lightning after we send you our money on Coinbase.
Edit: I see this conversation about trust is already happening elsewhere in this post.
