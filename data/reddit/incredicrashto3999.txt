I've been bashing bitcoin since 2017
Then it quasi-mooned to 10,000+ and this guy told me "Time to sui"
But as an experienced economist and Wall Street maven, I knew it was headed back down to prices like $4250 and $0
Possibly lower

Bitcoin is a fake torrent. It means that it used technology to verify that the file is copied well, but then you opened it up to find nothing of interest.
However we live in times of Post-Truth, so it is often heard that "earth is flat with an ice wall," "putin is a jolly good fellow who would never use chem weapons," "bitcoin is valuable," and other fake news.

It's just a mistake, a confusion. Sort of like people today are happy if Exports are up, not realizing that if you exported the whole country, everyone would die. 
People forgot Why they wanted to export. The knowledge was lost and forgotten.
So anyway, people somehow got into US Dollar, and then forgot why, and later they switched to BTC and forgot why.
However if you sit down and do the analysis, the whole Bitcoin thing is a mistake and a bunch of nonsense that contains nothing.

You can't really claim that just because some Past technology succeeded, then whatever you propose today is also valid.

If you suddenly declared 100 Bitcoins redeemable for 1 ounce of gold, then one bitcoin should trade at $12. 
However you don't even have that declaration, so the fair value is actually $0.
I'm not sure what Ledger means, but I will assume it's like a piece of paper, but not suitable for toilet tissue.

Here's how blockchain would behave if it was a useful technology.
You would read on the news "A bunch of 20 year olds that invented blockchain, have sold the patent to JPMorgan Chase for $25 million."
And this would mean that your banking fees drop from 1% to 0.2%.
However none of this has taken place, so Nouriel Roubini has concluded that blockchain is worthless.

Dear fool, 
The price per share is not important. Kuwaiti dinar is probably 500+ yen, and it doesn't prove that Kuwait is 600 times richer than Japan.
In other words Unit Size is not crucial. You could have a million:1 reverse stock split of Enron and it would trade at 10,000 bitcoins.

There is such a thing as "account value." Namely if you invested $100,000 and the thing went down 80% then your account value is counted as $20,000 not a hundred

One doesn't have to be an expert in a particular field, in order to grasp its value.
For example if I'm 9 years old, I can be convinced that a VCR is useful, because I can record cartoons.
So I will pay $ for the VCR and I don't have to be an electrical engineer and understand the device's inner workings.
So, it's just a copout to say: "You don't understand why this homeless bum's used toothpick is worth $10,000,000 and you only consider it $0 because you aren't a biologist with a deep understanding of the DNA of saliva."
That is your argument about bitcoin, that I would see its value if I studied at Geek University of Flat Earth

A torrent is a way to Verify that something is the same.
So it's exactly like bitcoin.
Now the trouble for bitcoiners is that those Torrents that contain no media are in fact worthless.

You have to understand the following.
If something is in Demand for the sole purpose of reselling it higher, that is not an authentic, deep demand.
Suppose a wealthy prisoner in jail has a stack of 1000 cigarettes (money). If the others reject his currency, he can still smoke them (intrinsic value).
But if he owned 1000 fake torrents, then if the other prisoners reject his currency, he can just throw them into the recycle bin (no intrinsic value).
Tldr You are deluding yourself that BTC is ever going above 4300 in the next one quadrillion thousand millennias.

I don't see any value in "solving unspecified math problems for nobody." 
Also computers function with 1s and 0s, so it's impossible to "limit" anything to 21 million. More 1s and 0s can always come in.
Not that scarcity matters in light of valuelessness.

You really should have done your Research as to why dollars have value, before creating this crypto thing and making people lose 1 trillion.

No. There was only 1 mooning worth mentioning, the one in late 2017.
However 2018 has been a house of pain, so nobody wants a piece of the action now.
The thought process of buyers has been pretty childish: "How can I be rich? There MUST be a way, God has my back. Well, I heard that Bill Gates was inventive and he bought into something 'modern' early. I should do the same with this 'bit' thing! After all, I read a website about it, and it mentioned multi-syllable words, that neither I nor the author understood."

This goes back to the question in economics: If you sink a bunch of money into some project, does that prove that the project is worthwhile.
In a way, your own case as bitcoin buyers proves that Marxist claim wrong. Namely you sunk $14,000 into BTC and now is it fetching that much
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:24:31
Basically the creators of bitcoin made 1 big mistake which rendered their whole project null.
They assumed that U.S. dollar was worthless, and people accept it for no good reason.
So they said: "Hmm. In that case, we have another worthless thing (BTC), and people may accept that as well."

There was only 1 hyping event, and the previous moonings were tiny and insignificant. Only known by the dork lobby.
