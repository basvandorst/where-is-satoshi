It's the mainstream media, they do this all the time.

Honestly, I'm not sure if buying illegal stuff is a good idea, especially in the middle east.

Absolutely nothing. That's why this bubble will most likely burst one day. The only value bitcoin has for those buyers is the BELIEF that someone out there will want to buy them off their hands later on for an even higher price.

Serious questions: Is coinbase/gdax the same thing? also, why are the prices on coinbase/gdax always so much higher than other exchanges? (example: BTC/EUR is 14k on coinbase but 'only' 12.5k on kraken)

Can someone explain to me what GDAX is and why it shows prices way higher than what I'm seeing?

Well, to be honest. 95% of the people who buy/bought Bitcoin see it as something to invest in. I'm almost 100% sure that the majority of this sub consists of people like that too. I bought bitcoin to earn money, not because of the idea. 
I know it's probably going to be its downfall, but does that really matter? Bitcoin would never be worth this much without these people.

Thanks for the detailed explanation. One more thing, I'm not sure how all of this works but if I have let's say 0.1 bitcoin on Kraken, and then the fork happens, will I automatically have 0.1 bitcoin and 0.1 of the new bitcoin fork (not even sure what it's name is), or do I have to do something to obtain the forked currency?
