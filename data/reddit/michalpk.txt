It isn't easy task to choose the right fee. Imagine unlucky period of 30 minutes without a block coinciding with surge of transaction let's say 3000 extra TX with 41sat/byte  from an exchange deciding to use this low fee period to consolidate UTXO. Suddenly your 40 sat/byte TX which should have made it easily to the next block is stuck in the mempool for months...

Use bitstamp no withdrawal fees and they support segwit

Risk worth taking. All Bitcoin community members must learn that blockspace is valuable resource. Bcash will learn it too, but the hard way
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:42:26
Bitcoin can still increase the block size if there is not adoption to LN and completely  erase the bcash from the crypto landscape.

Just out of curiosity who was his employer?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:19:32
What would push "progressive" companies as Coinbase to implement more efficient ways to use blockspace if we simply increase blocksize now? 
@_date: 2019-07-25 11:13:49
It would be as useful as preparing for Trump becoming the pope.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:14:26
There is no one mempool. Every node has its own with adjustable rules of what TXs are evicted.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:41:16
Difficulty and mempool are completely disconnected. Difficulty changes as  hashing power changes to keep blocks being mined approx every 10min. Mempool is getting full because there are many more then 1MB per block size  transaction submitted. More efficient transactions and segwit transactions could increase the amount of transactions processed.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:25:39
My personal opinion is that after segwit and schnorr adoption will go to ~70% and we have still full block we will have very easy job to get consensus on some simple blocksize increase.

Good luck in getting rid of anybody especially miners.  If core team at least a tiny but understood something about emotional intelligence and listen to other people we didn't have to be in this mess.  But the attitude I know what I am doing all others can just FORK Off will mean that others will do just that.  Which is shame.  Bitcoin will survive.  Core team most likely not....  Unless miracle happens and after successful activation of segwit on litecoin majority of miners will vote for segwit.  But I believe that is just wishful thinking of many on this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:25:31
And why they don't like Core? They just woke up one morning and decided Core is evil?

For those who complain about the fee. I buy bitcoin every month las time it was on 15th of Feb for ~1000USD Today I will spend let say 10 USD in my regular coffee shop  I saved on BTC price increase over 2USD in two weeks. Paying 30 cents fee isn't such pain. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:07:42
Absolutely agree! I was just about to write similar post. In last few months I realized this anger and hatred affected me nuts to much. goodbye bitcoin core goodbye BU. Mainly good bye this little ridiculous group of angry people. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:57:48
Why are they suspicious? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:13:04
The more you insult BU suppoerters the more you push them to position "We will never accept core's solution". Agree their development team can't do much good development, but they can do a lot of damage. Fanaticism on any side hurts us all. Luckily both subreddits are insignificant sample of the whole bitcoin user base.

If I were to deploy LN on a big platform/ wallet(something like cashapp I would deploy quite a few LN nodes with enough liquidity to ensure smooth enrollment. Just my 2c 
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:41:58
This kind of attitude is the main reason BU exists.  If  core team and its supporters had a tiny bit of respect and communication skills we could have been on 90% hash rate support just about to activate Segwit. ��

Thanks now I went through the settings and found import of XPUB on Mycelium
@_date: 2017-01-30 14:17:37
Hope you learned the lesson that desperation has no place in SW development. Especially not when 15B USD is in stake. This puts BU back at least by 6 months if it ever recovers. I am not a miner but I would never put BU on my machine after this unless I personally review all the code. Which is too much work comparing to staying with existing code or moving to segwit.
@_date: 2017-01-29 11:37:01
This debate is for long time not technical. It is about making majority comfortable with the solution. And accepting some compromises. And this proposal is as extreme as it gets. It is a huge slap in the face of the group which wants at least some on block scaling. Even if it would technically the BEST solution ever, significant part of the community will block it because it does exactly opposite to what they trying to achieve for next 7 years. I don't believe it will get anywhere close to 50% support in its current form. With starting point of a value somewhere around 1MB there is no reason for anybody to object.

Agree. I think I will have to talk to the big shots in the bitcoin community.  But at the moment I am not even sure if it's good idea.  I can already see "expert"  media reporting about civil war in bitcoin :-))))) 
@_date: 2018-10-26 09:42:59
Depends on your channel setting. You can have lockout time set to one week and then you need to check only once every couple of days but you have to wait 1week to get your many when you close channel without cooperation with other node. Or set it to 5 hours but then you have to be online pretty much all the time ...

Just to add to condors theories.  I am really bored today...  :-),  He could have deleted keys in panic moment if he believed he would be a target of an investigation.  
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:23:23
Because even channel open/close transaction can one day overfill 1MB block. And there will be still transaction where participants will prefer to settle directly on chain. If the blocksize growth is in sync or lower than HDD size and network speed increases why not take advantage of technology upgrades? My parents would be fine with 10MBit/s internet connection, but when they got offer for 40MBit for the same price they obviously accepted it...

Don't ever sell them for Fiat. Pay with them for  goods or services.  
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:31:21
Think about waiters in coffeshop or salesmen in any other brick and mortar shop. With cash one must trust that employees hand over all the money at the end of the shift. With this approach I don't have to trust salesmen or worry that somebody might steel the tablet with bitcoin wallet.  Basically nobody in the shop can give out bitcoin not even at gun point. :-)
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:21:59
No it will happen when merchants will technically refuse fiat money by making it very expensive to pay with fiat.

Dimon believes governments are going to ban bitcoin when it gets too popular:
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:03:12
Yes that's true but luckily developers don't need anybody's permission/collaboration. After segwit all development is on top of bitcoin. So no miners, exchanges or anybody else can delay it anymore.
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:52:20

I still use bitstamp but circle is at least as cheap sometime maybe a bit cheaper and has huge advantage of being linked to my debit card so I can buy instantaneously unlike on bitstamp where I have to wait 2 work days.
@_date: 2016-11-10 21:27:58
Simple solution. Stop using coinbase or any other "managed" wallets. Buy bitcoin there or on better places like bitstamp or circle, withdraw it and store it yourself.
@_date: 2017-01-28 21:04:45
It might be technically perfect but with 0 chance of activation...

Probably thanks to the exchanges batching TXs. The average transaction size is way higher recently.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:00:35
correct ... thats actually even simpler and more powerful in some sense.... 
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:43:28
End a real ass miner could mine empty blocks. forcing "real" BCH miners to mine yet another one if they wanted to get any transactions mined... Or the whole BCH freezes. So the potential loss would be even lower as he would need to mine 1 block every 2 hours minus the real blocks with transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:24:31
Anonymity, time to get approved might cost you more than BTC fees... hassle of sending passport photos and other shit.... and in many countries banks don't send money to Bitcoin exchanges. For example whole Raiffeisen bank group.

As it happened to many good projects in the past , they loose the focus on customer and try to make quick money instead of developing features. I am going to delete Mycelium (default wallet for 3 years) right after I find first stable android wallet with segwit and custom fees. Makes me sad ...

It is more important now to make bcash look like useful currency and make spam transactions there. Otherwise they would have 2kB blocks

In case of chain split they will decide which chain they follow. They might loose a lot of coins on replay bugs etc... and go bankrupt. Also in general unless you do daily trading, keeping coins on exchanges is very stupid idea. Your trust third party with your coins.
