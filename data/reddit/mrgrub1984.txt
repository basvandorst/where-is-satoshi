Because you control and hold your own money...not a bank or visa.

No...someone else is in possession of your money that u withdraw with your debit card that you are in possession of. The institution that stores your money in an account that they allow you to have access to is truly in control of your money..the government could seize your account, the bank could cancel or freeze your card, etc. They are in control of your money whether you chose to see it or not.. just Google to find stories of people getting fucked by banks, visa, governments, etc. 
Jesus Christ...this isn't hard.

Conspiracy theory? Wtf are you on about...I'm just pointing out that technically you don't control your money...it is possible for them to do exactly what I'm talking about. People have these things happen to them all the time...try googling it. I haven't tried but I'm sure you will find horror stories all over the internet asking for help...

Not true, my company does tests to check knowledge on a subject..very few of their positions require college. Companies are starting to tap into the self taught crowd because they realize people like you exist..they don't want to learn...they just do what they have to so they can get by. No real initiative..

I still remember sitting at my computer first time I found Bitcoin..it was less than a penny then. I wish I would have actually read about it instead of just scoffed at someone I thought I was trying to get my hard earned money...

For every 9999999 people that have no issue there is always someone that does. Maybe you?
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:26:59
Yep..fuck you.

Wow. .such nerdage.

That's not a diss...if it only sees $5700 and not less by the time everything is all said and done this round then it's a compliment. It was less than that just a few months ago..

I'm sure there are exceptions..but...I'd put money on it he's one one.

Yeah...this place is pretty dumb anyway. I don't think I've seen one useful piece of information on here...all I get is alerts for stupid memes when the price changes one way or the other. Bye.

You must be a Democrat..."gimme something for free... I deserve it!"

Not internet no...just Reddit and social forums. But...thanks either way. If I see /s again I probably won't remember that it means "sarcasm"...
