This kind of misunderstanding is one of the biggest roadblocks to mainstream adoption. You are expecting everything to be "taken care of" of course, and a visual bug like showing you your balance when your balance is not confirmed is a huge breach of trust between user and blockchain.
This is an unfortunately expensive way to learn about the importance of always being in possession of all of your private keys. Sorry to hear about your loss :(

It's not the ideal acceptance of Bitcoin, but we have to crawl before we can walk. The idea is that more businesses will consider Bitcoin, which leads to more of it being held and price stability.
Unless a business can pay its bills with Bitcoin, it is unreasonable to expect them to hold it. To me, a passthrough might not be ideal, but it does more good than harm.

In your analogy, I believe you are correct. Most pigs see a bar of gold and think nothing of it. Smart pigs see a bar of gold and think "ooh, shiny, I bet some people will want this, I'm gonna get some." That's you. 
A smaller minority of pigs says "this is a unique metal in that it is an excellent conductor of electricity, one of the most malleable and ductile metals available and perfect for currency - it's rare, supply is controlled, malleable enough that my primitive society can make coinage and doesn't tarnish/corrode and I'm going to value it accordingly". That's a pig with a proper outlook and more important has the proper logic to be able to apply an appropriate valuation. 
Of course you think it has no future. You know see something interesting, but you don't know why. There are reasons that gold (not analogy gold, real-life gold) became an important metal for civilization, as opposed to any other element.

You are confusing FDIC insurance with federal limits on credit card/debit card liability. The $250,000 is the guarantee from the US government if your bank shuts down and it is covered as a cost-of-doing-business from banks. They pay for this by other activities, but it's irrelevant.
What is applicable in this case is not insurance, it is federal laws (and thus no premiums involved). For cases of credit card fraud, you may be liable up to $50, depending on how the fraud occurred and if the bank believes you, which they usually do, but it's not insurance. If the fraud occurs via ATM/Debit card, you may have to be liable for $0/$50/$500/fully liable depending on the time period it takes for you to report the fraud.

The Rodrigue chart is used to explain the stages of a bubble (the text on the x-axis) not the shape of the bubble, that's just illustrative. His point was that bubbles go through stages not "this is literally what it will look like". 
It's totally irresponsible of whoever wrote this to lead the reader to the conclusion by warping their data to PART of an illustration. If they want to show correlation and seriously believe that it's not an illustration, they should show the R value not just a thumb-in-the-wind.

You missed my point. I don't agree that bitcoin (or gold) are a financial investment at all. If they are an investment at all, they are an investment of time/support/attention in the future. We should all use it more, regardless of if the activity of doing so is related to future wealth.
The economic impact of maintaining "the ability to transfer wealth between people" is huge and a weight on the global economy. The idea of Bitcoin lifts that weight.

I've been debating the same thing myself for a $100 gift. All the recipients I have in mind are people who don't have the interest level to follow along a complex discussion of keys and security. The occasion is more of a "savings bond" type gift than "amazon gift card."
I think OpenDime fits my needs, but haven't seen much discussion on r/bitcoin about it.. 
* It's a physical object that they can keep around somewhere  
* they don't have to understand blockchain or cryptography, just that it's sealed until they break the seal to confirm the value  
* I can put some btc in it and they can verify the value without my help
* They cost $12.50, which is not obscene

Kurzegesagt videos don't always have to be about something with practical applications. One of the most helpful videos they have is on explaining the Fermi Paradox. With the exception of a few billionaires, there is nothing we can do but sit on the sidelines. However, knowing the paradox does open your mind to think more deeply about the idea of life and what it takes to have sentient beings.
The Kurzegesagt video that the community needs more is along the lines of "What is the original purpose of money, how bankers and governments repurposed it and what are some solutions out there to return it's pure form". Bitcoin is just one version. There are (and have been, and will be) more. But, if we can show an explanation video like that to someone who has not been exposed to the reasoning (and there are plenty out there, but Kurzegesagt has a particularly appealing approach to it) then they might start to get interested in Bitcoin and start doing follow up research - which adds to the critical mass.
To grow the community, it doesn't always have to be full-on recruits. Sometimes just the idea of Bitcoin bouncing around in someone's head (a seed) will manifest itself in different ways and random places start invest in Bitcoin because "they saw this cool video once and that got me interested".

You were asking for the password to a server you didn't manage on behalf of a user. This is not the same thing at all. In fact, even in the case you mention, end users should take other measures to authenticate you before handing over the password.

He's really just saying that he thinks bitcoin is a scam and he doesn't know why. Neither of those statements are substantiated if you've done "a lot of research on Bitcoin". That sounds more like what you'd say if "I've heard the word Bitcoin and I think it's a scam".
1. The original holders of Bitcoin cannot set the price of Bitcoin any more than Warren Buffett can set the value of the dollar in the global market.
2. Similar logic, there are too many bitcoins to be able to influence it this way. Also, if he really believes this, then shouldn't he buy bitcoins now and wait for the creators to execute this move and thus profit? I don't even see how this part makes it a scam. This is more like a simplistic argument on why you should invest/speculate.
The market capitalization of bitcoin is approximately $1.5 billion USD, so you'd need to have enough bitcoins to be able to move that amount of value. There are approximately 11 million bitcoins in circulation, and 25 new ones every 10 minutes (or less). While technically any market can be influenced, it might actually be easier to do it with another commodity or foreign currency than BTC.

It might be easier to mentally separate out the actions of using bitcoin for purchase and converting from USD to BTC.
For example, on the day that bitcoin is worth $135, you could find someone to sell you 2 bitcoins. Now you have 2 bitcoins.

I think you might be misunderstanding what gets included as a transaction. If I have 10 BTC in a wallet, and I buy something from you for 0.1BTC, I have to transfer the entire 10BTC, 9.9BTC back to myself and 0.1BTC to you. 
It would be the equivalent of counting the entire value of my checking account every time I bought a candy bar. That's why it's not a meaningful metric for bitcoin, it's not a proper comparison - not because transactions aren't meaningful.

Spending bitcoin is the same thing as selling it on an exchange. Until businesses can buy their raw materials with Bitcoin, they will ~~liquidate~~ convert them to fiat immediately.

I think what they meant to say was that you need security ops people in addition to developers that inherently understand security. Even if developers code their software properly, not securing the production systems that the secure code is executing on makes their code a waste. Security is an organizational wide commitment. 
It's like making a totally secure ATM and putting it outside in the worst neighborhood in a city. Sure, the ATM manufacturer did a good job assembling the ATM under typical bank conditions, but the environment matters just as much. As does all operational procedures related to the ATM.
tl;dr it's everyone's fault at Bitcoin Central, not just the developers.

That chart has "an algorithm that attempts to remove change". The entire point of the anonymity of Bitcoin is that intent is not apparent. Wallets like Armory sometimes send change to a different address than the origin address, so you can't tell if it's change or what. There is no way to know how off the chart is - it could be 5%, it could be 50%.

"Okay, hondadewd, what's the plan?"  
"I found a third party payment processor that will allow us to accept 'Bitcoin' - you know, that new digital currency that's in the Wall Street Journal and CNBC, etc. We get US dollars, but we get to say we accept Bitcoins!"  
"What? That's just nonsense."  
"I dunno, that dealership in California that started accepting bitcoin is nationally known now, I bet we could get WABC to do a quick story on us.."  
And then take it from there - many upvotes to comment about not being obnoxious about it. If you push too hard, then it will just make it a sore subject, and that's not what you want.

I think something was lost in the way it was phrased. Once a nonce+transaction list (a block) matches the difficulty, it is announced to the network for all other clients. Then it must be accepted by a large amount of the network before it is official part of the blockchain. It is technically possible to introduce whatever block you want, without meeting difficulty requirements and with made up transactions, but getting enough clients to accept it is the hard part. 
So, as global hashrate increases, it is more computationally difficult to compromise the network by introducing a forged/bad block because it simply will be rejected by the majority.
Hence, the assertion that the service miners are actually providing is securing the integrity of the network.
