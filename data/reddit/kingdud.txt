This is why I love reddit. I read the initial article and thought "Typed random characters into a captcha and got an IP address? What? All you'd get is the IP chit-chat back and forth + a 'captcha failed, try again' answer."

I personally find it somewhat amusing that the ASIC revolution made it so that 'miners have to...' do stuff. It also just so happens that the same company that makes the ONLY profitable ASIC for mining bitcoin, and runs one of, if not THE largest bitcoin mining pools, also has a twig up their ass about not activating larger blocks for as long as possible.
I'm aware other altcoins have tried to prevent ASICs or limit their power, and some are successful. I know it's a gnarly problem. But it's just...it's hilarious in that way that you chuckle, but you really just want to shoot someone in the dick. I wonder how much of this segwit/block size drama can be boiled down to antminer not having an ASIC design ready for larger blocks, or some other feature added in, and needing time to get the ASIC design ready before the feature activates...
I'd also be curious to learn: What happens if we change the network such that, instead of X% of miners having to signal segwit (or anything else) to activate it, we have individual full nodes signal agreement of requirements for things, and any miners who do not generate blocks matching those requirements do not get bitcoins?
I'm aware a LOT of miners would stop overnight, but the hashing power of bitcoin is not at any more risk than it already is, with one company effectively having a monopoly on mining hardware.
...or is the problem with my idea that it's relatively easy to run 50,000 copies of bitcoind on a linux box, and generate a HUGE number of nodes to 'simulate consensus', and the reason miners were picked was because that requires far more monetary investment, and thus, is unlikely to be abused as easily?

Let's put it this way, you and two others in this post are the only three to say anything other than 'thanks, great review', and all 3 of you say "But there *might* be something you missed; core devs need to say it's ok.." as your core argument. I call that FUD / fearmongering / etc, and all 3 of you immediately respond with ad hominid attacks ("I'm crazy", "I'm arrogant", "I don't take criticism well", etc). Meanwhile, I'm just sitting here being amused.
I made this post expecting questions like "What do the {} mean?" and "Wait, how did you figure out what IsWitnessEnabled() did again?" Instead I was met with:
1. 1 note from Phil that I made a negated logic mistake
2. 1 request to clarify inconsistent phrasing around segwit being required vs already being enabled (I used the wrong word in two paragraphs).
3. Many thank yous
4. 3 people all saying the *exact* same line, getting called on their BS, and losing their minds.
That is not coincidence. That is not chance. You've all 3 exposed what you're actually here to do and I am amused as you flop around trying to make sure no one notices you're a fish out of water.
@_date: 2017-03-31 02:37:36
True story: I'm not familiar with the codebase either. I just found that stuff by searching for function names on github and reverse engineering what was happening. :)
Also, you've completely missed the point of bitcoin being open source. You are trying to say "Trust only the core devs", whether you realize it or not. That is not the trustless system Bitcoin is meant to be. That is why I wrote this post to say "Here's how you read this, here's how you interpret what you read."
Granted, it would take months of study to really be able to read this code as well as I do, but...we all need to start somewhere, and sometimes one good explanation is all it takes to get a brain 'in the door' as it were. Regardless, the point is that anyone, even a joe-blow like me who can read code, can read over the code and trust that it isn't being nefarious. I don't have to trust a GPG signature from some guy I've never met. I can trust myself.

Uhhh, no. You write the code to say 'until block X, use PoW algorithm Y. After that, use Z.' That's how you maintain 6 years of blockchain history while switching PoW algorithms. It's actually pretty trivial.

I don't have a Pi to test with, so two questions:
1. Does ubuntu's auto-update feature work in the pi-reduced version of ubuntu? If so, that would keep it up to date.
2. can you run a bitcoin node on a pi nano, or is that too gutless and you need the actual pi?
@_date: 2017-03-11 20:17:48
genuine noob question: I thought running a full node required the entire blockchain to be useful? Or is a full node running in pruned mode still useful to the bitcoin network, just not as useful as a full node when it comes to helping new people get up-to-date with the blockchain?
edit: Oh. Ok. So apparently because one does end up downloading the *entire* blockchain with a full node, even in pruned mode, you *have* actually validated which blockchain you are on. So running in pruned mode is the best of both worlds with the caveat that truly new users to the network will have to rely on people willing to save the full block state before they can setup their own full nodes. (without reverting back to trusting someone that is).
@_date: 2017-03-31 13:55:21
oh, ok. In that case, yes, do not include the changes to validation.cpp and that will have the desired effect of showing you as running a BIP148 client. My reccomendation, change:
    ss &lt;&lt; "UASF-Segwit:0.2(BIP148)/";
    ss &lt;&lt; "UASF-Segwit:0.2(BIP148-NE)/";
to show you support BIP148, but do not support it. (-NE meaning non-enforcing...this is a convention I came up with here and now.)
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:45:31
Eh, we need the miners, but they need users. There should be a check and balance system. Currently it behooves the miners to hold everyone hostage because:
1. They generate new coins, to fill in lost ones.
2. They create the blocks that allow transactions to take place.
3. The higher any fees go, the more bitcoin they get for finding a block. At current fees, of about .0005, if they include 30,000 transactions in a block, they earn another $18,300 for finding that block. granted, compared to the $61,000 (they still get 50 coins per block? Or did it halve again?) they got for the block itself, the $18K is somewhere between a nice bonus and a LOT of extra cash. Why would you want transaction fees to go down when you make nearly 30% more per block with them high?
I agree the miners should get fees, but there needs to be a mechanism in place that...does not reward arbitrarily constricting transaction throughput.
@_date: 2017-03-31 12:37:40
Yes, as I said, the standard Core client does this. The Core client would require miners (only) to activate BIP148.

More FUD. Lovely. [Line 1738]( is where the rejection function begins. It continues until line 1997.
Nowhere in the entire function is any lock issued or requested. None of the rejection cases request any lock, or do anything other than return a non-true result (and set an error message). Moreover, this function does not reference any static variables (it does access global data, but it does not update it; read-only). The function calls made by the function only get values or check settings, they do not change them. These two things combined mean that the function is [thread-safe]( by simple virtue that it doesn't write any value to non-local storage, it only reads data, then returns a result based on what it read.
But for real, you can't attack me as a person for being 'new with the code base' then try to cover that up with 'I understood it as you did -- looks correct'. You're either ignorant of programming and don't understand how to evaluate a function for thread-safety or you do. I do. If you did understand how, you wouldn't have worried about locks. Quit throwing FUD around to distract from the fact that this patch does exactly what it says it does and nothing else.
Also, don't try to FUD an engineer. We see right through that bullshit.
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:51:31
So, finding a block whenever: ok, fine. Not filling that block 100% (assuming enough transactions exist in the mempool) unless the block is elastic (IE: any un-used space isn't written to disk/network as 0s): totally unacceptable.
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:17:37
I'm waiting to see the high level implications myself. I may stop running a BIP148 client just before the change would start if it looks like only a small portion of nodes are going to force its activation; no sense causing a chain split. But taking the 'wait and do nothing' approach is wrong, so today I'm taking an action and will constantly re-evaluate my position as the landscape changes. Segwit failing is not the worst thing ever; it's a painful slowdown, but other, potentially better, ideas can take its place that do the same or similar things and are more accepted. Or...maybe the miners will just dig their heels in until all transactions (fee and value) go into their coffers. Who knows.
Regardless, I am just as in the dark about the high level implications as you are. I just have faith that by signaling 'I demand this happen', maybe some people will actually agree it's a good idea and cause it to happen. When faced with a chicken-and-egg problem, I just decide to be an egg, because at least I've then decided *something*.

Hm. I shall brain on this. My counter arguments all run into the same problem: switching to a CPU only algorithm forces miners to buy CPUs instead of asics, but they have hundreds of millions of dollars. If one miner has 500,000 CPUs, me firing up an i7 6700k might actually not be profitable, because I have to pay for power and he (basically) doesn't. Let me think about a way to resolve this issue...because that's the best counter-pow change argument I've yet heard, the reality that it would actually solve nothing. The altcoins that use CPU-only mining haven't seen the end result of this because, quite frankly, they aren't worth enough to go after in that way.

The potential for the chain split exists. However, 'wait and do nothing' doesn't work in bitcoin-world. We have a chicken-and-egg problem where, metaphorically, people say "Well nobody is going to vote for a non-frontrunner candidate, so I'm not voting at all because what I want can't happen!"
Then this BIP comes along and says "Here is the candidate you all wanted to vote for, you just need to donate to their campaign!" We donate by running full nodes with this client. As more people join the campaign, the unknown becomes a front-runner candidate, and it becomes possible for the masses to get what they want, because a few people were brave/smart/willing enough to resolve the chicken-and-egg problem before wider agreement existed on who would win and who could win.
Think about it this way: a chain split only occurs if people let themselves be locked to inaction by fear. If we are brave and dare to do something new, a chain split won't occur, because who mines blocks that can only be validated by a few dozen nodes scattered across the globe?

The block, as it stands, is 1MB, whether it's 1MB of 0s or 1MB of data. This argument makes no sense. That is one of the reasons the blocksize debate focuses so heavily on so-called elastic blocks. So we don't end up with 3MB blocks where 1.5MB are just 0s. Instead, a 1.5MB is just that, 1.5MB. But the current spec would make a 1.5MB (data) block actually take up 3MB on the network/disk, because the rest of it would be 0s.

The reason for it is this: Currently, 95% of the mining hashing power needs to signal support for segwit / generate segwit enabled blocks for 2 weeks before segwit will activate. Since, in the past year or so, no more than 30% have actually started signaling support for segwit, and the fees to transfer value with bitcoin have surged, people are getting a bit pissy with how much money they are losing to fees.
Depending on how you collect your numbers, it breaks down something like this:
* Miners: 30% are ok with segwit. 30% want BU instead, 40% remain neutral.
* Exchanges: Remain neutral by and large.
* 'users' (people running full nodes): 98% or more support segwit
* Transactors (people sending bitcoins around): No metrics exist on these people, unless they are also running full nodes / mining.
If Segwit fails to get 95% consensus from miners by November 15, 2017, the proposal will expire and segwit will *never* activate. It can, at that point, be replaced by a potentially newer solution or the idea can be scrapped all together.
The reason for this UASF is because of a realization that a significant chunk of miners do not have bitcoin's best interests in mind, and the gestalt belief (I personally think it's a wrong belief) that miners are happy to mine and remain ignorant of how bitcoin proposals can work. Thus, relying on the miners to vote with hashing power alone creates centralization and this is bad. So allowing nodes to require segwit blocks lest transactions be rejected encourages (in the same way jail, or whippings encourage) miners to signal support for segwit, or risk losing all income entirely when their blocks get rejected.

FWIW: You can run a full node on a super-small piece of hardware (mine runs on a $200 [mini-pc]( {$200 price includes SSD and RAM needed to get that box working). Also, if you can install it on an OS/filesystem that supports filesystem compression, do so. Compression will save you about 25% disk space (depending on compression algo) vs normal. With compression, a full node install will need approximately 94GB of disk space, and without compression 117 GB.
As for it becomming a bandwidth hog, my own full node only uses about 3GB/day of upload traffic, and the daily download traffic is tiny, maybe a few hundred MB. On linux you can use [tc]( to limit your upload bandwidth so you don't choke your connection.
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:02:42
yea. Not to mention dropping $2k on a miner which then (in the U.S.) costs about 11¢ PER HOUR to run, and needs to run 24x7x365 to be useful...that's $963 just in power costs, on top of the $2120 order price. That's...a bit expensive. If (and there is a reason they don't) they would build these where you only bought 1-2 asics at a time, the power efficiency would make them economically viable.
The price to get involved is simply too steep for the average person. Way too steep. Most people don't have $500 in savings, much less $3000.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:47:34
As of about 4 days ago, a good option became compiling your own full node with this:  source code (basically, it says any block mined after August 1 2017 that doesn't support segwit will be rejected). As more nodes come online, momentum will grow. Miners will have an incentive to support segwit of a large percentage of all the nodes which validate their blocks require segwit in order to consider a block valid.
@_date: 2017-03-04 12:01:44
...that is the most moronic thing I've ever heard of. I don't mean you are a moron, I mean the idea that you have transactions waiting to go into a block, a block that TAKES UP FUCKING DISK SPACE, and you choose not to shove those into the block. What the actual fuck?!
Ok, I read a few more replies before submitting this comment and calmed down *slightly*. I don't understand the low-level implementation of bitcoin that well, so am I correct: I thought you could only find a block every 10 minutes (or maybe that's dogecoin...but the blocks are *supposed* to take around X minutes to find a correct nonce). So am I right in thinking that what they are doing is finding a block 'early', say at 9m, and rather than filling that block to 100% over the next minute they publish it at the 9m mark, with transaction space leftover, because it ensures they get the profit instead of some other miner who finds the same nonce in the next 60 seconds and happens to have a slightly better latency or whatever?
@_date: 2017-03-31 05:04:43
This is the FUD trying to come back. *FormatSubVersion* is only used to generate the User Agent string, and that function is only called in two places in the code: both times to set the User Agent String (surprise surprise!).
As for the modification to actually reject blocks, the code works the same way as all the other reject statements within that function. "Condition not met? -&gt; reject".
This argument that there is somehow something to be gained by having a bird's eye view is, in this case, completely baseless. It is the creation of FUD through ignorance. I may as well say vaccines cause autism because I don't understand how vaccines actually work. That is literally the exact same level of argument you and forkwarofattrition are making. You don't know/understand, or 'someone might not' so there is 'reasonable doubt' in your eyes. This is bunk. It is little more than thinly veiled feamongering. The only thing I don't know is whether you do this because you genuinely can't see your own actions in their absolute context, or because you are actually malicious. Either way, the harmful outcome to the community is the same, so please stop, regardless of cause.
But I agree, by all means, more eyeballs than my own should review this code. The onus or myth that only a Core Dev's input is valuable though needs to die. This change is *truly* simple. So simple I'd see it as a reasonable assignment for a second-year programming student in any college in the U.S. Obviously, not every student would get it right, but they would have the skills, by and large, to implement this change correctly. Compare what your technical skills were like your second year in college to what they are like now. Huge difference right? 
I do not have an adequate command of language to fully describe just how trivial and isolated this change is. These two particular functions in Bitcoin are not tightly integrated to *anything*. This is not like the linux kernel, where a change in one spot will have unforeseen impacts elsewhere. This is more like two sheets of paper that have been taped together. To draw from one to the other, you just move your pencil down.

@_date: 2017-03-06 23:30:08
Hm. I've been on both sides of the fence. I was originally for BU because anything that would get bigger blocks on the network fast was good. 37¢ transaction fees are NOT a good thing! But what brought me away from BU? Two good arguments:
1. "What coin has ever retained value following a hardfork?" (my reaction) "Oh...right..."
2. Back in 2014 I was all about dogecoin (I have never really been that hard for bitcoin, but I am grateful for what it started). I remember there was a debate back then as to whether dogecoin would remain as designed, with unlimited coins forever, or follow a bitcoin model where all the coins to ever exist were finite and that was it. Once it was set in stone that dogecoin would forever be unlimited the price crashed from .XXX200 to .XXXX14 within a month and stayed there basically ever since. Something as upending as BU will, in all likelihood, lead to a similar price crash. Neither fork will (probably) recover.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:31:24
Not sure if you're joking or not. But you aren't seriously saying a 51% fork to BU is somehow based on a greater consensus than the requirement you've laid out?

@_date: 2017-03-31 02:56:40
I don't understand the full list of motivations, but basically, the date was chosen because it was the 'last chance' to activate the BIP before it would become inactive because it took too long to reach consensus. The date of August 1 was actually moved back (er...closer to now) from its original place in time because if not enough miners signal segwit support, there may be a massive drop in network hash power, and that would take around 2 weeks to correct, so the activation window was lengthened to ensure Segwit activates, one way or another.

@_date: 2017-03-23 11:54:40
Since nobody is answering your question completely and accurately: The only thing you can do is power up some relevant mining hash power (so recent Antminers, such as the S7 or S9, basically) and point them at a pool that supports segwit (you'll have to google this. Apparently slushpool lets you? But I don't actually know which pools do/do not support segwit).
Hashing power signaling segwit is THE ONLY thing that will help activate segwit today. We need 95% of all BTC hashing power signaling segwit for 2 or 4 weeks (I forget which) before segwit will be guaranteed to activate.
So, even if you found some novel 0-day to shutdown all the BU signaling hashing power, you'd have to keep them shut down for almost a month before it would allow segwit to activate...don't bother going down that route.
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:08:08

So...your argument to someone wanting a decentralized coin is to convince that very community to accept a centralized takeover? What the fuck do you think we are? Mindless drooling idiots? No. The second that 93% of miners leave for 2x 93% of miners will find themselves owning hundreds of millions of dollars of ASIC mining hardware that can no longer mine bitcoin. That's what will happen. It will be the swiftest kick in the balls you've ever seen.

It's not really appalling to me. BitcoinXT has been mentioned here quite a lot despite the claimed censorship. I only see what pops up in my feed because I'm subscribed to and I learned about XT within a day or two of it happening (the common delay of me learning about any bitcoin advancement).
The blocksize 'discussion' that I see is more like two children screaming 'no I'm right!' and the adults who propose changes being shat upon for thinking instead of acting. In such a climate, putting some of the children in timeout and ensuring that things besides what the children care about are allowed to be seen and discussed is reasonable.
If I start seeing people complaining that they have to pay a $1-2 fee in order for their transactions to be processed within 1 block (10 minutes) then I'll agree that the blocksize debate is indeed quite dire. So far as I know, most people pay 0 fee and still get most of their transactions caught by the next block in the chain; most certainly the people who pay a nominal, probably sub-cent fee are still getting their transactions processed within one block...the system is working exactly as it was designed and providing us PLENTY of time to think about a good solution like adults.
Seriously, it's not censorship if someone who is not passionate about bitcoin like me knows about the issue at hand. At worst I suspect the moderator's actions can be described as 'limiting spam' or 'quelling the vocal minority'. Of course I've also seen some very interesting numbers on the number of XT clients and miners being downloaded and deployed. I agree with the notion that the blockchain, not a single repo or group, determines the future of the technology.
If people want to knee-jerk to this issue, ok. That says something about human culture...or that I am woefully uninformed as to how bad the problem has gotten. Either way, you're being overly dramatic, and that doesn't help anyone.

Yea, I'm one of those people who might one day hold bitcoin (dogecoin is more my thing...all $2 or so of it). From what I've gathered the 1MB blocks are too small because more transactions happen in ~a time interval~ than can fit in 1 MB. Thus, someone said "We need bigger blocks! Clearly!" and another camp said "No! All transactions will complete eventually, if you NEED to fit in that first block right after your transaction, you must increase the 'fee' you give to the network for that transaction!"
And from that simple difference a giant bitching fest was born because people are spoiled by merchants sucking up the transaction costs of credit cards? Did I fail to understand the core argument, or is there something I didn't mention also at play?
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:20:30
I didn't even consider that part. Now I know :)
@_date: 2015-08-17 21:35:42
Eh, yes and no. I'd say that the blocksize goes up when a given transaction cannot be completed in...*checks bitcoin's block time* 3 blocks (~30 minutes). I assume the backend can be programmed to keep track of what pending transactions are waiting to enter into a block. The new blocksize would therefore be 'however many transactions happened, or the new MAX_SIZE, whichever is lower'.
It's a headache to program, but flexible enough to work in the real world. The 30 minute (I'd also be ok with a 1-2 hour window) window still gives an incentive to pay an increased fee because, well, you only have to outbid the fee others are paying, and I really doubt people will start paying more than a penny or two anytime soon. A few ppl who are bad at math, sure, but not most people.
Keeping a static blocksize doesn't scale, I agree with that. Especially not with blocks every 10 minutes. At the same time, it makes no sense to have fuck-you sized blocks that are mostly empty.
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:25:35
Uh...ok? Let another altcoin handle those cases? Dogecoin maybe? Bitcoin for moving large volumes of cash, altcoins for moving small volumes of cash frequently. A $1-2 fee won't kill buying goods on Overstock or a meal at your local pizza place, the only thing I can really see it killing are people who want to send $5 back and forth very quicky for...some reason.
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:04:22
It doesn't, it grants some transactions priority over others. It's the difference between saying "I want my widget from Amazon in two days!" and "I'm cool with about 2 weeks." Hence the reason the fee you give to the miners determines your priority, it's no different than paying for shipping from amazon.

hah. Right as I stopped mine. Long story short, p2pool is CPU heavy. I was trying to run it alongside my bitcoin node, but it simply takes too much CPU time. After 8 hours of running, it had only verified 8000 or so out of the 17000 shares in the pool. My getBlockTemplate times were nearly/a little over 1 second as well. Note: the PC I was running it on was a low-power mini-PC. The total system power draw at max is 17W.
So...p2pool (by itself) is about 3x as heavy as running a bitcoin node in terms of CPU need. When you add in the frequent calls to getblocktemplate, that becomes more like 4x-5x. A modern desktop CPU wouldn't break a sweat, but my little minipc can't handle it. That, combined with the fact that plenty of p2pools already have 0 miners, and me not doing any mining of my own...fun project to screw around with for an evening, but not something I'll keep doing long term.
I'm not mad or anything, we all have our technical acceptance criteria.

Whoever gave you your router also gave you a locked down firmware that can't be customized outside of their pre-defined whitelist. This makes support for them easier because they take away people's ability to do stupid shit to their hardware. It makes it a nightmare for a power user who just needs a little bit more.
For what it's worth, if you get a mini-pc (I use a Zotac CI232) you can turn it into a router (the CI232 comes with 2-ethernet ports + wifi; use a simple $8 switch to get more ethernet ports if you need them). It's powerful enough to be a router @ 1Gb/s (so if you have Gb internet, it won't throttle you) and run a bitcoin node, and mumble server, and firewall...you get the idea. :) Considering it costs about the same as a router (~$200) it's a pretty solid deal imo.

For real though, that post is 'bitmain hates Greg Maxwell; he didn't post any 'proof'! Just a well constructive narrative we will, also without proof, debunk categorically'.
Well, that's a decent plan, except for a few glaring problems:
1. You are literally the only group that doesn't think segwit activation is worth doing...but your post claims you support it, despite your own pools not signaling support.?! Wtf?! Pick a goddamn side!
2. No mention of Bitcoin Unlimited anywhere. Why?
3. 'To the moon' is mentioned, but specifically the language used on reddit about the exact same feature, 'extension blocks', is not used anywhere in the post.
4. Greg Maxwell is one guy. One guy with a pen does not topple a legitimately profitable corporation unless there is legitimacy to doubts. Bitmain: Is there any legitimate reason to doubt you? No? When why are you afraid of one man with a pen? Have you heard the phrase 'sunlight is the best disinfectant'? It applies here...sunlight removes doubt.

PoS is useless because it allows power to snowball. Imagine all the dollars Jihan has now compared to you (something on the order of 100 million) and now imagine that gave him 0.5% of all mining profits going forward because he has 0.5% of all the money. '.5% isn't much' Ok...compare that to your $100 investment granting you a mere 0.0000005% of the profits. In other words, you'd make 1 ten-millionth the amount he would. How would you *ever* catch up in this system? How would the large ever do anything but get larger?
PoS is an interesting idea that is HORRIBLY implemented. PoS should be a requirement to allow PoW, but should not determine coinbase rewards in any way.

@_date: 2017-04-27 03:59:23
What you really need is an algorithm that doesn't scale with money. LTC and Vertcoin both just demonstrated that people with lots of money can fuck you over (via nicehash in the case of vertcoin, and via bitmain in the case of litecoin). A PoW change can't fix that problem...or at least, I don't know of one that can. Until that issue is fixed, the fight is largely moot.
I mean, sure, we can fix bitmain's kill switch with a PoW change, but that would be a patch for..what? A year? Two? Maybe constant change is enough. Maybe not. What I want is people smarter than me to think about whether it's possible to have a PoW which doesn't scale with monetary investment. Whether you have $1 of mining gear or $10,000,000 you are able to mine at a level playing field. I'm NOT talking about proof of stake. That's a bad idea.

loooooooooooooooooool. Because emotional arguments have any place in a technical solution. looooooooooooool. Bitcoin has prospered under technical excellence. A lot of people forget that, but it has. Trying to say anything other than robust technical logic will bring about 'good' is folly.
Every single full node verifies blocks and passes them out. Every pruned mode node verifies blocks are correct. Every.single.node.participates. Period. No if,ands, or buts about it. No qualification of it. Every single node participates equally.
The thing I will agree with is that if, by some fluke, 'the market' reacts badly to a UASF then would kill off one of the two chains. Amusingly, this is exactly what is predicted to happen, except it's the BU chain that will die off, not the bitcoin one. Or at least, that's what is supposed to happen. I really, really, doubt BU will be the Trump of the bitcoin world. I concede it is technically possible though.
We agree on signaling, that's why I made mention of clients that actually run proper BIP148 code. Because those are (effectively) flag-day based nodes, not signalling nodes.

Strictly speaking, you don't need to have an algorithm that is resistant to ASICs. You just need an algorithm for which no existing ASIC works. It takes...somewhere between a few minutes and a few weeks to code a new algorithm or tweak an existing one such that ASICs stop working. It takes months to get an ASIC produced. Imagine if you had a stack of PoWs in your code just waiting for a bit flip to be activated. Any ASIC that could handle them all wouldn't be fast. Any ASIC designed for just one of them wouldn't work once a bit was flipped. People would realize the futility of developing ASICs before they ever hit the market.
This whole debate of 'we need ASICs!' vs 'No we don't!' is a bit silly in my eyes. We need mining power. How much and where ti comes from is immaterial. Anyone with $10 million can buy more hardware than someone with $100. Until an algorithm is developed that can normalize the power of money...ASIC vs anything else is just a dick measuring contest between two females.

Alternative: Use a deduplicating filesystem, like ZFS (if you turn dedup on), and then you can have 3 separate copies of the blockchain that only take up 1x disk space. That said, pruning mode is probably the better option.
Note: Nodes in pruning mode WILL NOT pass blocks out to connected nodes, they will only validate transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-19 12:01:05
Ehhh....yes and no. Two chains will be created regardless of where they get created. If it just so happens that the first two blocks mined after BIP148 clears are both segwit signaling blocks, then the BIP148 chain will be the longest chain period. As for nodes processing transactions, well, only miners create blocks, every other node just:
1. Keeps a mempool of pending transactions
2. Confirms blocks that miners generate.
So all nodes are created equal in that sense. Only non-pruned mode nodes (so light wallets are out) actually pass blockchain data to other nodes though. Yeah, no, your argument doesn't make any sense due to how the chains work. Where the nodes run actually is unimportant, and that's kinda the point.

the -j \`grep\` stuff on the make command just causes it compile in parallel, using as many threads as you have have. This *dramatically* reduces compile time. With -j4 on a 6700k, it will still take around 5 minutes to compile. Note: C++ compilers are memory hungry, you'll need around 2GB of RAM to compile with -j 4.
the '-r' option to useradd says 'make a system account', so no login shell, no home directory, no ability to login with that user, only for that user to run processes for the system.

Would it be technically possible to keep the current hashing algorithm, but add in a second, also valid algorithm, which was GPU only, with its own difficulty? In that way, blocks could be found by ASIC *or* by GPU, but their difficulties wouldn't affect each other (so if 70% of the ASIC power died one day due to a 'bug', the GPUs wouldn't cause blocks to take longer than 10 minutes while difficulty retargeted).

Segwit will not activate. Fact. Jihan won't allow it and he personally controls/is responsible for the signaling of something like 15-30% of the hashing power of bitcoin. If Greg had addressed this issue I might care more about what he had to say, but "do nothing and wait for Jihan to die" is an unacceptable solution. One person should not have as much power as he has, and BIP148 undermines his power greatly.

IE: if two wallets had the same private key, both wallets would see coins disappear after a transaction occurred.
3. Tie into point 2 the reality that if you received 5 bitcoins on 5 different addresses, and you wanted to buy something that was 20 bitcoins, your bitcoin transaction would need to use at least 4 of the 5 addresses you received coins on. This is where the 'data size' of a transaction comes from, and is why fees are 'computed' rather than static.
4. Tie into point 3: the person who receives the 20 bitcoins would, theoretically, receive all 20 coins to a single address, so when *they* went to spend them, they'd have ~1/4th the network data needed to send coins as you did with 4 addresses.

Sooo your argument is that because LN requires two transactions to pay someone (transaction start, transaction complete) instead of 1, clearly we need to double the size of the blocks?

segwit already makes the blocks literally 4x larger. Well, up to 4x. In practical terms, it will double them just by turning on. This whole "Well give us big blocks too!" is just a farce to save face at this point. We don't need bigger blocks. We need segwit. We can create a BIP for bigger blocks once we get segwit activated, but trying to play U.S. Congress and tack bullshit onto a good idea to 'get it passed together' is not going to fly.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:14:52
False. This UASF works by rejecting any blocks that do not signal support for segwit (IE: the one action that would cause segwit to activate). Because some miners will not signal segwit and NOT run BIP148 supporting nodes, they will cause a chainsplit.
* bitcoin^A: This is the chain where non-BIP148/anti-segwit miners create blocks
* bitcoin^B: This is the chain where BIP148/pro-segwit miners create blocks.
At current hash power, bitcoin^A will mine 30% faster than bitcoin^B. That will cause it to become the longest chain and standard wallets of 0.13 and higher will follow bitcoin^A. 
After 2016 blocks have been mined, the difficulty on both the bitcoin^A and bitcoin^B networks will retarget. bitcoin^A will become 30% easier to mine and the bitcoin^B will become 60% easier to mine. At this point, any intelligent miner will switch to the bitcoin^B chain and start mining. "Why?!"
Because the second the bitcoin^A and bitcoin^B chains split, coins earned by mining became tied to the chain they were mined on. Once the difficulty drops 60% on bitcoin^B if the 30% of miners who are undecided opt to signal segwit support and mine on that chain, they can find 12.5 bitcoins every 5-7.5 minutes, versus fighting for 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes on bitcoin^A. Not only that, but almost everyone wants segwit, so *of course* the chain that supports segwit will win in the long term. It makes no sense to earn coins on the chain that will always lose in the long run. Some miners will switch before the difficulty retarget, others will need to see the light before they switch. In the end, the majority of hashing power WILL tie itself to bitcoin^B because they aren't' fucking retarded.
Within one block period, bitcoin^B will overtake bitcoin^A as the longest chain, and all 0.13+ version wallets will rewind their blockchains to when the chain split, delete the data relevant to bitcoin^A, and replace that blockchain with bitcoin^B automatically. This is how consensus within bitcoin works; the longest chain always wins, and if a chain becomes longer, the offending data in between is removed and replaced. "How did bitcoin^B become longer than bitcoin^B again?" Because the non-retarded miners (IE: everyone except bitmain -- everyone who wants the coins they mine to have value more than 3 months after they are mined) will point their hashing power at the chain which supports segwit, which is bitcoin^B. That, plus the difficulty retarget, will cause bitcoin^B to mine blocks faster than bitcoin^A's chain, and that is why B will overtake A as the longest chain.
"What about exchanges? Which blockchain will they follow?" If they do nothing and remain neutral, they will work just like any other 0.13+ wallet. If they are savvy, they will follow both chains and allow investing on both. Regardless, the only chain, long term, that will see a rise in value will be the segwit chain. So whether exchanges remain neutral or support it does not matter. The segwit chain always wins in the long term. Too many people want segwit for it *not* to become the most valuable chain, even if it's shorter, and that will eventually make it the longer chain.

With pruning, you need around 2.5GB total. The chainstate itself won't shrink in pruning mode and takes up around 2GB of disk, the blockchain will take up the other 550MB. This assumes you use --prune=550. Even in pruning mode you will have to **download** 136GB, but no more than 2.5GB of disk will be used at any time, the rest will be thrown away as newer data is ingested.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:28:37
Uh....so will it overwrite, yes. However, because the 'make install' step just copies the binaries out of the compilation directory (I'm assuming you didn't compile the code in /usr/local/bin) if you ever wanted to switch back to core you could just cd into the folder where normal bitcoin was compiled and re-run 'make install' (no need to recompile, just that literal command, 'make install'). Then restart the service.
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:04:04
Yea, you can. But there's a catch, think about this as the blockchain:
* block 1500 -- oldest block kept in pruned mode (current block - 500)
* ...
* block 1998
* block 1999 --wallet a last synced to here
* block 2000 --wallet b last synced to here
time passes
* block 5001 -- current head of live chain
When you launch wallet A or B and you are as far behind as in the example above, whichever wallet syncs fully will orphan the other wallet, requiring the entire blockchain to be downloaded. The reason it will be orphaned is that it will need to start looking for new transactions at block 1999/2000, but the oldest block in the pruned storage will be block 4500. So it can't find block 1999/2000 and will complain that the entire blockchain has to be downloaded to search for transactions. There are two ways around this problem:
1. When you are far behind, only allow your wallets to sync for 100-300 blocks before closing the wallet down, switching wallet.dat files, (or however you switch wallets) and continuing the sync. this way neither wallet ends up being more than a few blocks ahead of the other one.
2. Keep ~2GB of blockchain data, and open your wallets daily to ensure both stay in sync with the network. You can, of course, keep more. The chain grows around 1GB/week, but once segwit activates, it could grow at ~500MB/day.

The mempool will drop the lowest fee transactions once it fills. By default the mempool is 100MB, and the current number of unconfirmed transactions (~230K) is 10MB shy of this limit (unless I am mitsaken). So no, you don't need to make the mempool bigger. As for RAM requirements, I believe a stock node will run with around 1.2GB. It will grow to that over the course of a day and stabilize there, it won't need that much just to start up. I have tweaked my own node so I can't use it as a guideline.

That's when the final segwit activation period ends. All BIP8 activated BIPs have a time window in which they can be activated. November 15th is the end of the activation window for Segwit. Segwit can be reintrocuted on Nov 16th with a different signaling bit, but it would have a (6 month?) activation window (again).

listen=0 makes it so you only download data from the network, and don't upload any (so you should get unconfirmed transactions!). maxuploadtarget disables sharing blocks with the network, since you don't have the bandwidth for it. See if this helps.
edit: listen=0 might make your node useless in some scenarios (IE: you run a no-wallet full node {good idea!} and connect to it with your actual wallet via LAN).

The only way to own coins and have the government NOT know about it is to mine them. Even then, they will be able to figure it out unless you do some creative bookwork. The government knows what an Antminer S9 is for, and has a realtime graph of your power usage (or rather, can get said realtime graph from your power company; assuming you have a smart meter). So unless you buying that Antminer shows up as 'Sugar, 3000kg' (which is also illegal, btw), they'll know you own *should* own some bitcoin.
Now, here's the catch. The systems to connect all these dots are not automated yet. The government is working on many big data projects to automatically connect these dots. Do not use the word paranoia for what is, in fact, reality. Shame anyone who dares use the word paranoia to dismiss valid reality.
So, is there a way to get bitcoin in a truly non-tracable way? Yes. Is it easy? No.
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:32:23
We sure can! It's called 'download and install a UASF node'. Then we get segwit, just like BIP91 would do, without any changes to the UASF code (which everyone says is already rushed and just barely sufficiently reviewed). Compromise is a two-way street, and in this case, the UASF only ever got created **because** of the transaction spam and miner's clinging to a non-binding HK agreement as some source of moral outrage. I don't care one iota if they kowtow or not. I care that they pull their heads out of their asses and realize that the rest of the word will NOT put up with their culture's bullshit.

"But bigger blocks won't be a problem for anyone. 4TB hard drives are only $100!" &lt;--every segwit2x supporter out there. Remove head from ass, and realize users, like this guy, are already underwater, and you *are* working to centralize even more with bigger blocks!
Now, onto OP's question: you'll need to rescan the entire blockchain in order to find all the transactions involving your private keys. This means you have two options:
1. Run your wallet in pruning mode, and download the entire blockchain from scratch (just delete the blocks and chainstate folders..DO NOT delete wallet.dat!). It will import transactions as it downloads each block
2. Find a friend with a full node (or anyone who has the entire blockchain). Put your wallet.dat on their system, rescan the blockchain using your wallet, then move the now updated wallet.dat file back to your machine with the pruned blockchain. 
The way that  works is by updating the internal metrics within the wallet referencing what the last block scanned was. Basically, among other things, the wallet has a bit of data that says "And all of this is correct as of block 451,544", so as long as your pruned-mode node has block 451,544 in it when you start it up, your wallet will continue to sync correctly (if not, it will give you an error that you need to redownload the entire blockchain, which in pruned mode will cost you ISP bandwidth equivalent to the blockchain size, but it will not take up all that disk space, it will only take up 2GB + pruning limit).

Hard forks can never reorg (reorg is the term for when the initially shorter bitcoin^B replaces bitcoin^A). Only soft forks can end in a reorg. It is technically incorrect to consider this a hard fork in any respect. By technically I mean 'physics says no' not 'he got off on a technicality'.
Could a miner attack bitcoin^B in the way you described? No. The moment segwit activates the chain they are trying to defend becomes worthless. They wouldn't go back to mining there. **Nobody** has a realistic scenario where the non-segwit chain ends up being more valuable than the segwit one. So...no. That attack doesn't work because economics make it non-viable for the attacker.

Altcoin price skyrockets along bitcoin price because of places like nicehash, where you pay bitcoin to have other people mine altcoins for you. Between that and trading, there is an extreme incentive to keep the prices closely related (or at least inflating together).

Note: mining to an external wallet is actually cheaper until you have &gt;= .05 BTC to withdraw, prior to that, withdrawing from a nicehash wallet incurs a (substantially) higher fee rate {22-4.5%} than just mining to an external wallet directly {4%}.

So you're saying you don't trust yourself? Well taht explains a lot. By your own definition, your side is full of traitors, and our side is full of traitors. So when everyone's a traitor, nobody is! Yay! The fuck is the point of 2MB blocks anyway? So more transactions can be spammed to fill those too? Or is it purely down to greed and not wanting to lose any of those sweet, sweet transaction bucks? 
I hate to break it to you, but nobody will support bigger blocks so long as greed can even be a theory as to the motivation, and if the past year and a half of seeing bitcoin's network attacked with transaction spams to keep fees artificially high have taught us anything, it is that we will hate the miners more if such behavior continues in the future. The UASF happened due to miner stubborness. Do you really want a PoW change, or any one of a dozen other options users have to *completely* fuck over all the HK miners? I wasn't at the HK agreement table, neither were the hundreds of other UASF nodes. Guess what?

Not really, in any scenario (chain split, hard fork, soft fork) you keep your coins. They may lose value for a few months as the market stabilizes and picks a winner, but you'll have coins with value on all the chains that get created. The winning chain *should* end up with a value equal to or greater than today's coin. If it doesn't, it's because (somehow) chinacoin won, and in that case, your coins will be worth very little I imagine...because too many people aren't stupid enough to want chinacoins.

(one reason of several) Hard forks require a client change to support the fork. Soft forks are backwards compatible with existing clients. The BIP-148 chain can eventually reorg the 'core' chain, replacing all blocks since August 1st in the Core chain with -148 blocks. This is why it's a soft fork. If that couldn't happen, it would be a hard fork

If the overall score is below 1600 or so, or the per-thread performance is lower than ~450, it will be too slow to be a useful node. If it's something like 1500/425, that will probably be ok.

Segwit needs to activate and become the dominant chain before 2MB blocks are hard forked. "But why 2MB blocks?" Because more fees. But also because they are *desperate* to sneak changes into the header in with the 2MB proposal that re-enable ASICBOOST. Activating SEGWIT prevents all forms of ASICBOOST.

FUD. But also, say that the Core chain persists for a month before the -148 chain overtakes it. That means:
1. All blocks mined on the Core chain (and their associated coinbase rewards) vanish from the miner's wallets.
2. All transactions (payments!) on the Core chain vanish
Those are both 'bad' outcomes. That is why the -148 crowd keeps saying "The safest thing is to just run our software...". It really, really is. It's why the miners are using segwit2x to try and activate segwit before the UASF happens. They don't want *any* miners to lose income mining on the core chain, because that will truly wound bitcoin. If the bitcoin community is so broken that a month of transactions could be undone...smart money would simply move to another coin.
That is what makes 148 'the big stick'. Every single node currently deployed (Even BU nodes!) would reorg to the 148 chain if and when it becomes the longest chain. There is *nothing* that can be done to prevent that without a hardfork.
The chain split argument comes from this reorg risk. It's people trying to argue that a reorg is a bad thing and shouldn't be allowed to happen, without actually saying reorg, because reorging the chain is actually a critical component to the health of the chain (that feature exists to recover from bad actors, not solely for -148 to use).

@_date: 2017-06-22 17:43:42
1. Maximum block size will change from 4MB on disk (Segwit) to 8MB (hence the 2X). Meaning the blockchain goes from growing at a maximum rate of 52GB/year (today) to ~209GB/year (segwit), then to 420 GB/year (segwit2x). This assumes all blocks are full, which the recent transaction spam shows is trivial and cheap for miners to do for months on end.
2. Impossible to know, not worth while to predict. Transaction spam can fill big blocks just as easily as it can fill small ones.
3. Not anytime before 2019 I think. Most core devs are against it primarily due to timeline (but that is not the only reason). It would be late 2018 or sometime in 2019 before sufficient time would have existed to develop the code, test it, debug it, think about its implications, and start rolling it out as a core release.
edit: I see you asking about bandwidth requirements. You can run a full node on (more or less) any size pipe, it will just take longer to transfer each individual block. If the on-disk blocks become 4MB instead of 1MB, then the number of blocks you can send per day (assuming you're always using 100% of your upload bandwidth) is reduced by 1/4. If you are not currently using all of your bandwidth, then you should instead multiply your current bandwidth by how large you think the average blocksize will be. I always think worst case, so for segwit that would be a 4x multiplier, and segwit2x would be an 8x multipler (vs today).

So here is where the NODE_NETWORK flag is defined in [src/protcol.h]( which includes the useful description of what that flag means:


(quote reformatted for reddit)
Then, in [src/net.h]( we can see that NODE_NETWORK is part of REQUIRED_SERVICES, but we don't know what REQUIRED_SERVICES does just yet.
Unsurprisingly, [src/net.cpp]( reveals to us that REQUIRED_SERVICES determines whether or not we connect to a node, and we do, in fact, only connect to full nodes, not pruned-mode nodes.
And, finally, in [src/init.cpp]( where you said you couldn't find anything about pruned mode, there is the line where nodes get their NODE_NETWORK flags unset if they are being run in pruned mode.
So, that pretty unequivicobly demonstrates that you:
1. Are wrong

Semi-related question, mostly because it's been bothering me for the past week or so since I thought about it. From [Bitmain's plan]( it seems like they are expecting/hoping for this chain of events to occur: {terms: Chinacoin = segwit2x, bitcoin = current bitcoin)
1. NYA flag triggers segwit activation on or before August 1
2. 2 months pass and the 8MB block hard-fork code activates within all chinacoin clients.
3. Bitcoin's hash rate drops dramatically due to 80-90% of the hashrate leaving (the 'hope' being everyone signaling NYA is also running chinacoin wallet/node software).
4. In the scramble to continue transactions, the user base will hurriedly switch to chinacoin clients because their coins exist on that side of the fork too, and block confirmation times are normal.
5. Bitmain gets the control of chinacoin while keeping most of bitcoin's former value. His coup de'tat is successful.
Have I overlooked something, or does that seem like their actual plan? If my scenario is correct, do we have a backup PoW anywhere else we can drop in quickly (just add another SHA256 round as a patch until a better PoW is chosen?)? I...my thought is that this plan may actually work if bitcoin doesn't have a contingency plan in place that will prevent the userbase from having a good reason to move to chinacoin. Thoughts?
I wish I had the mathematical background to come up with a PoW on my own. I'm more suited to...simpler programming tasks. :/ I feel like we're about to get caught with our pants down and I'd really love to have pants on under my pants.

I always figured if I could get $3 million I could find a way to invest it such that I could live on the interest forever. I'd do some looking into the most tax-advantaged way of doing that, but at the most knuckle-dragging level, drop all $3 million spread across various index funds and you should get 8-13% interest per year. I think anyone can live on $240,000/year. And if it's a shit year, well, hopefully you didn't spend all $240K.
for reference, I have no intention of *ever* needing 200K+ per year. Rather, around 40-50K is currently how much I need to live comfortably. However, I live in a VERY expensive part of the country, so housing is about 65% of that total. I'd move somewhere far cheaper to live first. Most of the extra cash is for when I'm old and if my body starts to fail. Also to account for inflation.

The UASF gives miners no choice *but* to activate segwit (well, no choice where the coins they mine have any value).
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:45:15
Here is the simple version:
1. Currently the miners are signaling support for 'NYA'. This is a BIP9 signal bit similar to BIP141 for segwit. Currently, no BIP/code gets activated by the NYA signal.
2. The NYA signal is an informal (IE: manual) agreement between miners that, come July 21st, they will add the BIP141 signal to their blocks, to try and activate segwit.
3. The reason July 21st was chosen is because it is one block difficulty retarget period (around-about) before the August 1st deadline of the UASF activation. Basically, they're delaying activating segwit as long as possible, and are truly terrified of a UASF.
Those are the technical arguments. There are more social/speculative arguments to be made, but I'll leave those out for now.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:51:13
 There is far too much red in both tables for me to believe that the China-coin fork will have any value. And if China-coin causes a PoW change...they have to realize that all those developers saying no to segwit2x absolutely will do a PoW change and the users will go along with them. It won't be a minority chain. It won't. The number of common users who understand the value in a stable, decentralized coin is too high. China-coin will not replace bitcoin's value. Too many people are not idiots.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:42:06
For those bad at math, that means that in 1 year the blockchain can grow by 420GB. Currently it can grow by 52GB/year. Also for reference, the entire blockchain since 2009 is currently 160GB. Remember the transaction spam we've had for the past few months that caused all the blocks to be full? Well now the blockchain grows by 420GB/year instead of 52GB/year. Tell me how sustainable that is for *your* node storage.
Now, I want you to understand why some people want bigger blocks (one of many reasons).
1. Imagine that another UASF gets proposed and miners decide they don't like it. 
2. The UASF date is 6+ months away, but creating UASF nodes is easy, so UASF nodes start popping up.
3. Miners, using their new 8MB blocks, begin spamming transactions. Why? Well they own 80% of the hashing power, so they get back 80% of any fees they spend. By working together, they can make sure 8MB blocks get generated every 10 minutes, forever, and statistically only lose 20% of the money they put into those transactions. This is easily sustainable if the UASF would hurt their profits.
4. Within 6 months, the bitcoin chain has grown by 220GB. People who were running nodes on raspberri Pis and other systems without 500+ GB hard drives have to stop running their nodes because they can't store the blockchain anymore.
5. People cannot run pruned-mode nodes because pruned-mode nodes do not broadcast blocks to the network, and therefore only enforce the chain rules on themselves. They cannot help ensure other nodes reorg.
7. To prevent further UASFs from ever being a threat, the miners continue the transaction spam for 2 years. Now the blockchain is over 1TB in size, and it's only 2019. **Setting up new bitcoin nodes now takes over a month, due to having to download over 1TB of data**. UASFs are effectively snuffed out as a threat.

The PoW would change **because** of a massive drop in the hashing power of the network. By your definition, at that point, the difficulty and security would already be compromised. The PoW change would allow an immediate difficulty retarget + restoration of security through continued non-trivial hashing.
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:19:45
In the short term, yea. But long term, once segwit activates (and it WILL activate if he helps attack it) the price will surge and he may make money from his attacks, but also incur the wrath of the entire mining community for fucking everyone over. *grabs popcorn* this should be good!
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:42:31
How would you 51% attack a chain that only accepts blocks built on segwit? I'm...missing something. The only way that attack would work is if the bitmain-attack chain (for lack of a better term) were started at the same block as the current BIP-148 chain, but managed to be longer. Which they actually, probably, have the hashing power to do...ok, I think I answered my own question.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:40:37
Ok, let me ask the same question you are, but from an equally as accusatory angle:
1. Why did we have to create UASF code, fight this hard, and go through all this bullshit to get the miners to activate Segwit here, at the very end, one block retarget period before the UASF would force the issue?
2. Why is a whole new proposal, segwit2x, needed, when Segwit will do everything that is actually needed? We don't need bigger blocks. Why is that getting tacked on? Now that the transactions spam has ended, the mempool is almost empty. The size doubling from segwit alone would allow the mempool to completely drain.
So, I ask *you* how on earth is segwit2x for the users, when it gives us everything we want, but tacks extra bullshit onto it? Congress does the same thing and they are HATED for it. Why would we put up with yet another group treating us like congress?

Below is copy-pasted from another post I made (in which I was quite annoyed with a sockpuppet), so that's why the phrasing seems a bit...off. I can't be arsed to fix it.

In addition to what said, be aware, the hard fork he speaks of will only happen if you run a wallet that supports segwit2x. The hard fork will (probably) happen. For clarity's purpose, going forward **bitcoin** refers to the bitcoin we have today, know, and love. **Chinacoin** refers to the segwit2x-hardfork coin that gets created by the hard fork. That said, [Bitmain's idea]( is to get enough of the hashing power running this chinacoin software such that when the hardfork happens, bitcoin's confirmation time and hash rate drop dramatically. Their hope and belief is that, in the scramble to keep bitcoin moving forward and transactions occurring, everyone will switch over to running Chinacoin clients (since, ya know, all your coins exist on both sides of the chain!) and thus Bitmain will gain the control over bitcoin they so desperately want. This is basically a Coup d'état since BU failed.
What will happen, should the hard fork occur in the way I've outlined, is that bitcoin will switch PoW algorithms and let the chinacoin go off to its own special hell and die. All of bitmain's ASICs will, overnight, become as worthless as the chinacoin they helped create.

Don't keep a wallet on a running full node. Run a full node and keep the wallet somewhere else (in a VM, on a different computer, on your smartphone, etc).

@_date: 2017-06-20 19:11:09
*sniff sniff* I smell bullshit. I used the entire blockchain size because it wasn't until this year that we started having full blocks and ~something~ that was causing a transaction spam to keep the mempool full. If that transaction spam ever starts up again, the 8MB blocks are full, and that 420GB number becomes a reality. Suddenly, a raspberri pi can't run a full node anymore, because, well, darn, look at that, a full node now needs at least a 500GB hard drive! Well gosh darn bobby joe! That's unfortunate isn't it!
"Wait, another UASF is being threatened? Well..." *6 months pass* Now you need a 750GB hard drive? More UASFs? Fine! Years later 2TB minimum. This is **very** centralizing and totally unacceptable. Transaction spam isn't a theorical problem, it's something the miners can do on a whim without cost because, guess what, 80% of the miners want the bigger blocks, and 80% of the miners get the blocks, so any transaction fees they put into the blocks to spam the blocks they get at least 80% of back! Do you not see how this is an absolutely horrible idea? Really?
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:57:47
I disagree with your views on UASF, but since you ask a valid question:
None. I don't know any phones with the nessessary 165GB worth of storage space to hold the full blockchain. Due to reasons [I already explained]( pruned-mode nodes do not help spread the blockchain, they only validate incoming blocks. A phone like this would be useful as an edge node for a set of full nodes behind a network (why you'd run a pruned-mode edge node is a completely different matter, but it would work) or as an edge-node for a LAN where clients are frequently updated (so as to never get behind the end of the pruned limit).
Also, no, in pruned mode, if you say "keep 2GB" you only need about 4-5GB (the Chainstate takes up about 2.5G, and is not included in the pruned size limit, so it ends up being 2.5G + &lt;pruned size&gt; total space on a pruned node). You will only ever need that 4-5GB to run a pruned node in that config. You will, however, have to download the entire blockchain (or copy it from an existing full node).

It makes arguing with the government (should that day ever come) considerably easier. "You were hiding a wallet! Here's all your reddit posts about bitcoin! Where is your wallet!"

@_date: 2017-06-20 15:41:52
So, the NYA (which is what they are *actually* signaling) basically says that on July 21st, everyone who had been signaling NYA will start signaling segwit (BIP141) instead (or in addition to NYA). For now, the NYA signal doesn't actually do anything at all. Also, the process, come July 21, to signal BIP141 is manual, not automatic. So...keep running your BIP148 node until then....and after too.
The reason July 21st was chosen was because it is on or around the time that a new segwit activation period begins (it's an estimation). So if everyone signals segwit together on July 21st, they will activate BIP141 before the August 1 UASF date hits and causes a chain split.
They will then (probably) try to pivot into a position of "Ok, our NYA says you have to hard fork to bigger blocks now! We activated segwit!" and cry until 'we do it'. Similar to how the hashing power on litecoin held the coin hostage until miner's demands were conceded to. I don't think this will work out well for them.

When you run a pruned node, the NETWORK flag is disabled. The NETWORK flag is the thing that enables you to send blocks you do have to other nodes. A pruned mode node will never, ever, help send blocks to the network. So that is why running pruned mode nodes is not useful as a workaround for bigger blocks.
No evidence of a UASF being effective? I think vertcoin and Litecoin would beg to differ sir. It was extremely effective for both of them.

I didn't learn about 'face' culture until after I had stopped working with them. That said, I'm...not one to step on eggshells. I will give you technical objectives to hit and objective data/measurements to meet or find. If something 'fails' it is clearly defined that it did indeed fail to all invovled parties and the only determination as to why is:
1. Did I scope the data wrong such that I, essentially, placed the goalposts at the wrong spot?
2. Did they legitimately fail to hit the objectives?
In this case, I'm ok with them losing face in the event of number 2 because, well, you lose face for making mistakes, and they made them. So...system working as designed.
At a higher level, I always advocated to dividing work up with China more so that they had work they worked on and we had work we worked on and we didn't work together on anything. Why? Because:
1. Language barrier made worse by phone technology.
2. 12-13 hour time differences. Let's save both parties calls at 7am/9pm.
3. Cultural differences that will take generations to uproot.
It makes more sense, in order to get work done *today* to allow them full autonomy on something where you can clearly define the inputs and outputs. If they don't work in a way you like, then improve your requirements. Fundamentally they work to please their masters, just like westerners do. It's just that you need to give them far more objective and specific detail than most western managers are prepared to provide.

It's not just signaling support. The blocks also have to be built on blocks that signal support too. Basically, come August 1, 100% of blocks added to the BIP-148 chain will be segwit blocks, meaning the BIP-148 chain need only mine 1814 blocks before segwit will switch to 'locked_in' and activate during the next block retarget.

The default mining configuration (for CPU/GPU miners, I can't speak to ASICs, but also for the standard bitcoin wallet which you'd use to call getBlockTemplate() -- the method to actually get the template for the block you're building) all by default filter out 0-fee transactions.

Right, so BTC (non-segwit2x) gets segwit, and China-coin (segwit2x) gets their hard fork. So anyone who doesn't agree with the hard for literally just needs to not upgrade to a segwit2x wallet/node (IE: the same way we currently avoid running BU software) and we will get segwit without their hardfork. then, when they hardfork away and the hashrate drops, it won't really matter because nobody is going to suddenly start using their fork when all the value is still on the BTC name and consensus / resistance to change. I mean, hey, I'm all for them disrupting the network and causing a PoW change. Go for it. I...just can't wrap my head around how they possibly think they will win this battle.

It's actually pretty common for the Chinese to reinvent something that already exists. I'm not sure why they do this. But...when I worked with co-workers in Chengdu, for example, any script or program I wrote, no matter how well documented (or translated -- we had professional in-house translators who could and did make it perfect in Chinese), they would re-write it themselves. I never got a good feeling whether this was hubris, for their own understanding, so they could say "I made this thing" or some other reason. It never made sense *why* they acted this way, but I can confirm they do, in fact, act this way. Very consistently. It's cultural.

tl;dr: Run a BIP-148 enforcing node and your coins will be safe no matter what.
Think about it this way:
1. Prior to the chain split, any coins you have will be on both chains.
2. Once the chain split occurs, there is no way to predict which transactions will show up in the legacy and -148 chains. Both chains will be built on the same mempool, but because, at least initially, the legacy chain will build blocks faster than the -148 chain, those transactions will be removed from the mempool for the -148 chain by the time it gets around to building a block. So...it will be chaos when the reorg happens, figuring out which transactions did and did not duplicate across the two chains.
The simplest, most bulletproof way to ensure your coins live on is to run a BIP148 enforcing node as your wallet. The -148 chain cannot be reorged by the legacy chain. The legacy chain can be reorged by the -148 chain. That's why the -148 chain is the only safe bet.
Alternatively, don't spend or receive any coins for 2-6 weeks, while the chain reorg and UASF are underway. Once the reorg to the -148 chain occurs, it will be safe to resume sending and receiving coins. Any coins you already have will be completely unaffected by the chain split if you don't send them anywhere.

Put your coins in any offline wallet. As long as they are confirmed as in your wallet before the chain split occurs, they are safe. You can spend them once the chain split is resolved (IE: whenever segwit is active) and life will go on normally. For now, the normal bitcoin core wallet (from bitcoin.org, not bitcoin.com) will tolerate the chainsplit cleanly, but any wallet compliant with bitcoin core (NOT the bitcoin unlimited one!) will survive the chain split correctly.

You need to run a BIP148 enforcing client. You can get the software from [here]( (if downloading via command line, use **git clone  --branch 0.14-BIP148**)
Then compile and install to run. Alternative, pre-built binaries can be downloaded from

Here is the simple version:
1. Currently the miners are signaling support for 'NYA'. This is a BIP9 signal bit similar to BIP141 for segwit. Currently, no BIP gets activated by the NYA signal.
2. The NYA signal is an informal (IE: manual) agreement between miners that, come July 21st, they will add the BIP141 signal to their blocks, to try and activate segwit.
3. The reason July 21st was chosen is because it is one block difficulty retarget period (around-about) before the August 1st deadline of the UASF activation. Basically, they're delaying activating segwit as long as possible, and are truly terrified of a UASF.
Those are the technical arguments. There are more social/speculative arguments to be made, but I'll leave those out for now.

Note [Pruned mode nodes]( do not share the blockchain, they only download it. You will need around 132GB of storage on your phone to run a non-pruned mode node (Full Node). I have no idea how you'd get that much storage on a phone, but if you can solve that problem, go for it.
If you happen to have a freeNAS box, and can mount drives via NFS on your phone (idk, just theorizing!) then know that enabling gzip-9 in ZFS and storing the blockchain there will save you nearly 25% on disk space.

A few people I talk to say "We're preparing a PoW change" but like you, I see no code. This leads me to believe two possible truths exist:
1. There is no code and it's just a panacea
2. They have the code and it's being kept private so ASICs cannot be prepared ahead of time.
Personally, I'm willing to lean towards two. Sure it's 'keeping stuff private!' and the sockpuppets will run with that, but the people working on it are smart enough to realize you cannot beat someone as corrupt as Jihan by playing only in the light, so I'm totally ok with them keeping some things dark.

The funny thing about this attack is, sure the people orphaned lose some income, but the attack still helps Segwit activate. Even by attacking, he's still helping activate segwit. So...go ahead Jihan! Attack away! Help us activate segwit faster! I think everyone with more brain power than a carrot will realize they'll recoup their electricity costs within a month or two once segwit activates and the price surges. :D

FYI pruned nodes do not share blocks with the network, they only download them. A pruned node is only useful for a wallet, not as a network node (because it doesn't share any blocks with the network). Well...ok, a pruned node would still keep a copy of all transactions in the mempool. But that's about it.
I'm not trying to say 'don't do it!'. I'm just trying to explain that in terms of serving others, pruned nodes do next to nothing.

I don't know enough about SPV clients to answer your question. Breadwallet is an SPV client. It *should* follow the correct chain, but I can't say that I know it will in any way, shape, or form.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:32:06
Yeah...there'd be a proof of work hardfork before everyone installs the chinacoin client. If the hashing power ever tries to swing its dick that hard, we'll cut their fucking dick off.

In terms of losing your coins, as long as you run the official bitcoin core wallet (from bitcoin.org, NOT bitcoin.com) or some other wallet closely based on its code, you will automatically follow the BIP148 chain whenever it reorgs to be the longest chain. The only thing to not do prior to that reorg is to spend or buy any coins. Just sit and wait. As long as you wait, your coins will be safe.
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:58:58
I have an insufficient amount of knowledge about electrum to answer your question. That said, do not use the 148 node's wallet. Instead, for example, use a wallet on your PC that connects to your 148 node only (-connectto flag) and use that to sync. That way your wallet stays on the 148 chain and your wallet also remains isolated from your public facing node.

Heh, I've uploaded around 3TB personally, but I've restarted my node far more frequently (updating it, the OS it runs on, etc).

It's a threat that lasts for less than 2 months. The number of people who have value pent up in bitcoin and who want segwit will make the extreme majority of people HODL until segwit locks in. I totally agree spending coins during the activation period is...foolish. I've stated that view ever since the possibility of a chain split was presented to me.

That rate assumes bonds and long-term market decline. But yea, that's also why I target 3 mill, because the original number was geared for a 3% interest rate, then I realized I could pretty easily make a LOT more than that.
