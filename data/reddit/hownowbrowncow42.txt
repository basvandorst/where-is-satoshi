The average person who is buying a very tiny fraction of 1 bitcoin has close to 0.00% impact on price.  
Also, you didn't present the other side of what could happen.  You buy 1 btc at 15000,  then buy another at 7500 which lowers the cost basis to 11250, but also increases your overall investment by 50%, which means you have considerably increased your risk with no guarantee that you ever get back to break even, regardless of your new lower cost basis.

Ever single major bank in America is FDIC insured, don't fool yourself.  The vast majority of people who use banks in this country, use ones that are FDIC insured.  Just because there are a handful of small local banks that aren't FDIC insured doesn't mean it's not the standard.  The requirements for FDIC insurance are generally regarding capitalization level which can be manipulated very easily.

They know the government will fully refund any lost customer's money up to $500,000.  If that were not the case bank's would have to be considerably more careful with customer's money just as people would have to be considerably more careful on what bank they used.  It's not complicated, when you remove possibility of loss people take unnecessary risk.

At this point in time, that is correct.  However If you have $1,000,000 that you can put to the side you aren’t going to go to a local bank and just dunk it in a savings account.  Any half decent index fund will yield 5% average annual return given a reasonable time frame.

Looking pretty good.
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:49:32
No, you're missing the core argument.  My main point, if you bothered to read back to my original post, was that if you had a large sum of money to put to the side, over the course of 100 years, it would be insanely easy to outpace inflation even with very conservative investment strategies.  You seem to have the impression that investment is somehow a bad thing instead of a great opportunity.  
Also your sample size for bitcoin not devaluing over tame is based on such a small window of time, that it's tough to give it serious credibility.  
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:51:49

In fact I’ve mentioned several times why I think it’s important to have a strategy to outpace inflation.  
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:56:16
I mean, if you want to be technical, nobody with $1,000,000 that they don’t need to use is just going to park it in a savings account.  That level of interest rate is relatively recent phenomenon as well.  In the 80’s standard bank savings accounts carried 10%+ interest rates.
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:22:43
By this same logic, couldn't any crypto, created at a quantity of half the total bitcoin, be twice as scare and therefore twice as valuable?

The majority of bitcoin users are not using it as a store of value though.  The majority are either people who buy and hodl or are speculating on price.  The majority of people purchasing bitcoin are not seeking a safe haven for their wealth.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:41:36
Some of your points are valid but I’m not sure you understand how compound interest works.  If you put 1,000,000 in an account with a 5% annual return, at the end of 100 years it would be worth over $130,000,000.  Your purchasing power would be just fine.
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:04:38
Might be a better phrase for it.  Krugman is also a man who once advocated for the Untied States having a housing bubble, so there's that as well.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:10:07
That is totally untrue.  It's impossible for a lot of people to 'see a bubble coming'.  That's inherently part of what makes something a bubble.

@_date: 2017-09-27 22:22:52
How can something that routinely loses 20%+ of its value in a short time be a store of value though?  Charts show now correlation between prices swing in gold and bitcoin or the dollar index and bitcoin.
In theory I could see how it could pose a threat to gold but there's no proof that's actually occurring.

I’m not arguing that fiat is a good store of value.  I haven’t even remotely suggested that, you’re setting up a straw man.  
The technology available today makes investing, in a huge variety of options, easier than ever.  You can trade stocks and options commission free on Robinhood.

If your financial strategy involves never investing, you will never be able to achieve any decent level of financial freedom, regardless of currency.  
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:48:47
It's market cap (which I agree is small) is 4-5x what is was in the beginning of this year and it really hasn't gotten any less volatile. It's not like it's price is anywhere even close to stable, and certainly not enough so to be considered a store of value.
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:56:51
Actually that's not what a Ponzi scheme is at all lol.
What I'm saying is that the entire reason bitcoin is valued at higher than a few cents is because people believe it will be worth more dollars in the future than it is today.  Bitcoin, as it stands now, is being used much much more as a speculative asset than it is a currency and is the predominant reason it's seen such an amazing run in price in the last year or so.
Every currency in the world requires trust that you won't turn around tomorrow and be left with something worthless.

@_date: 2018-03-18 23:25:36
That seems like such a wild standpoint to try and make an argument from.  You really think someone who is smart enough to have earned $1,000,000 (or any other substantial amount of money) that they don’t need to use would really just put it under their mattress?  Of course not, they’d put that money to work by investing it.  Even something hyper conservative likes bonds would be enough to outpace inflation in most years.
You’re also assuming people got into bitcoin when it was trading at below current market price.  It’s obviously up an absurd percentage on almost any measurable period of time but someone who got in at $14,000 certainly isn’t outpacing inflation.  
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:47:40
You are mixing such a wide array of points into one argument that it’s very in-cohesive.  Although it’s very typical of what I’ve seen on this sub from people who are interested in crypto and only crypto.  
Again, the original point was if you left $1,000,000 in an account for 100 years you would lose purchasing power.  I’m saying that’s verifiably untrue and if your idea of money management is sticking any of your extra money under your mattress, or in a generic savings account, then you’re likely not going to have much success.  
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:23:17
lol that spreadsheet is solid proof that he actually did that 
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:28:11
Let me explain this differently.
In order for a bubble to be created, what has to occur?  A continuous stream of people willing to buy an asset as the price rises at unprecedented rates.  It's the greater fool theory.  If 'a lot of people' saw a housing bubble forming in 2003, they would not have bought houses and the bubble would have never been inflated.  Same thing for the dot com bubble before that.  
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:10:21
Right, what I'm saying is the phrase  "raised rates multiple times" is tremendously misleading.  
Yes - rates have been raised in literal terms.  The fed funds rate fell to .09% in December 2008.  It is now September 2017, nearly nine years later and the rate is 1.16%.  It's been raised by a little over 1% in almost nine years.  If you think that actually qualifies as raising rates, I'd argue you are very wrong.

A handful of articles do not make something 'rather mainstream'.  The housing bubble was not known by a lot of people, that's totally revisionist history.  If it was known by 'a lot of people' then it would have ended a lot sooner because people would have stopped buying real estate.
Even less people knew about credit default swaps and CDOs.  That's a nice line you took directly out of the big short buy the way ;)
Even without those products though, the housing market collapse would have still been devastating to the United States and world economies.

@_date: 2017-09-28 18:33:51
Just because something has appreciated in value over a short period of time does not make it a store of a value.  A store of value is something that will not lose much or any of it's value in a very volatile market.  It's something you can count on to preserve your wealth when many traditional investments are losing value.
By the logic you just laid out, Valeant pharmaceutical stock would have been a great "store of value" from 2009 to 2015.  However after that it lost close to 100% of it's value.  I'm not saying that will happen to bitcoin, although it might.  
However to claim something is a good store of value when it has fallen over 20% in very short spans on numerous occasions this year, has never existed in a recession/depression, and is still incredibly early on in it's existence, is inaccurate to me.

Also why would I mention the US stock market being a bubble in a thread about bitcoin?  The fact that they are both bubbles has no correlation.The entire US stock market is, without question, a massive bubble.  I think the same thing about bitcoin.

LOL @ raised rates multiple times.  You can't be serious with that. 
The fed funds rate has basically been at 0 for eight years now.  Only in the last few months have they even been able to raise it to 1%.  To suggest that they had multiple rate hikes is absolutely ridiculous.  
As far as inflation goes, I think the CPI under reports inflation.  No we haven't gotten the high inflation that he's talked about - you're right on that, but no economist is right all the time.

No I'm not willing to say that.  I'll openly admit bitcoin could run up to $10,000 or $20,000 or some amount much higher than that.  What I'm saying is that it's price is being driven almost entirely by price speculation and not by the underlying technology and at some point it will come to an extremely abrupt halt.  It won't go to zero, but I don't think it'll be worth much more than the cost of mining.

There's a difference between writing an article about something being a bubble and creating an investment strategy based on the outcome of that bubble bursting.

How many millions of smart people with access to that same knowledge were unable to do what he did though?  
He did the same thing during the dot com bubble just a few years prior.  I'm not saying the guy is a prophet but I am saying he very clearly has an understanding of economies and finance that not many other people in the world do.
It's amazing to me how many people here are acting like every money manager with a brain and a pulse saw the economic collapse coming in 08.  It was an incredibly small number of people who saw it coming and positioned themselves to profit from it.  Again, I understand if you like bitcoin and think he's wrong about it but dismissing his economic prowess is crazy to me.

@_date: 2017-10-13 12:50:46
It's a conclusion I've arrived at after studying the technology, arguments for and arguments against.  I'll try and briefly summarize why I think that.
I think the current price of bitcoin is almost entirely based on price speculation and people trying to profitably trade it.  I think almost none of the current value the market is pricing it at is based on the actual underlying technology.  The largest buyers and sellers of bitcoin don't want the actual coin, they want more dollars than they have now.  I think that because of those underlying facts, it will never be stable enough to actually be used as a serious currency and will remain a speculative asset, only drawing in more speculators in the short run.  I think bitcoin has a price floor of whatever it costs to actually mine, but I don't think it'll end up being priced at much more than that once enough people are no longer interested in speculating, which could end up not being for quite some time.  When I say it's a bubble, I don't mean this is the top, bitcoin could end up going to $10,000 or $20,000 or some other very high price, but I think it will come crashing down very hard very quickly in the end.

Unless the volatility is cut in an unbelievably massive way, merchants won't be able to accept it as payment though.  If you have a profit margin of, say, 8% you'd really be gambling by accepting payment that has routinely lost 20%+ of it's value in a matter of days or weeks.

You poor math skills explain why hedge funds performed so poorly during the housing crisis a decade ago.  It's that exact line of incorrect logic that led to horribly inaccurate modeling of potential mortgage defaults.  The fact that you also don't seem to know the difference between debt and equity instruments also explains a lot.

It's hyperbole.  I understand that a few 'moon kids' are not the sole reason why people are skeptical of bitcoin.  However, his/her opinion is only a slightly elevated version of the what 75% of the postings in this sub reddit contain.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:38:48
This is incorrect.

Not the bottom.

If you took Germany and Venezula's GDP, combined them, and multiplied them by 5 it would still be less than the United States'.
It's not even in the realm of comparable.

Actually a true holder wouldn't even be looking a price on a daily, or even weekly basis.

There's been inflation going on for decades here.  There is never going to hyperinflation here though.  The 'inflation is coming' crowd, has been saying that same thing for over 20 years now.

I really don't understand how people think comparing Zimbabwe to the the United States makes even the slightest bit of sense.

No no, $5mm doesn't sound like a dream.  It sounds like incoherent ramblings of someone who doesn't understand how any basic math works.

Your math is wrong. $1,000,000 x 21,000,000 = 21,000,000,000,000
21 Trillion, not 21 billion
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:53:26
Seriously, this is very incorrect.

This is, without a doubt, the dumbest thing I've ever seen posted on reddit, and I don't just mean within r/bitcion.
Basic math here:
21,000,000 btc is max
1 btc = $5,000,000
21,000,000 btc = $105,000,000,000,000.00
So to get this straight, you think, in two and a half years, the value of bitcoin will be worth more than the entire world's GDP?  
This is why people are still skeptical about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:37:05
This made me laugh.

Wrong 
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:12:49
This is literally the most incorrect thing I've ever seen on reddit.

Actually his $5mm estimate isn't bad on anything other than pure conjecture.  "Local Purchasing Power" has no releance on the fact that he's implying in 2.5 years, 1 btc will be worth 5,000,000 USD.

I used to really like Ron Paul until I realized he just makes the same doomsday predictions for decades on end until they eventually come true.  On a long enough timeline, even many wild predictions come to fruition.

BOOM.  ROASTED.

People complaining about the drops obviously didn't buy bitcoin at $576.70.

I said it was irrelevant because he was implying that Peter Schiff is almost always wrong and just got lucky with his prediction of the economics crisis, which simply based on his history as an investor is flat out incorrect.
