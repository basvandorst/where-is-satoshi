As in becareful with the electric bill. Someone pays it.
Have you looked at how much a bitcoin cost to mine with your equipment? Plenty of websites to help you out with that.. I think you will be shocked with the price.
Im sure the persom paying the electricity in your base wil be hell of happy with that type of bill lmao. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 08:08:20
Perfect. Its what everyone needed to read.

Well I don't care of the people who answer for their own gains. I care for what Bitcoin was created for. The people. Why is it that it has completely drifted away from that? Ok Bitcoin is a technology and we decide what it was created for.. The problem is if too many decide on something that is only for that group of people.. How is BTC for good? Doesn't that make it bad for all others?

I'm not here to talk about "When Moon"
I'm here to talk about aspects and the future of BTC. When i say "Ruin" I mean ruin the most basic thing of btc.. Mining. Sure nobody controls Bitcoin, But prices are manipulated. And if mining and prices are in control of others, then what makes it interesting to any other joe out there? It does remain censorship resistant to some extent. If were talking about BTC itself. But if were talking about price discovery, it is NOT censorship resistant. Just look how Asian traders use information to pump or dump the price?? Immutable yes, I agree. BUT "open to all" I do NOT agree. How does it stay open to all when a regular joe like me can't mine it? Sure i can go buy some and make the miners in control of BTC mining happy.

The level of fud on this post.. Lmao wow this is insane.
@_date: 2019-11-30 17:43:43
Need others to discuss this with! Lets go BTC community!
@_date: 2019-02-21 15:05:27
Nope nope nope sooooo much NOPE! 
@_date: 2019-12-18 19:49:50
Ummmm blocks? Doesnt make a difference if there was no transactions. Block time is still every 10 minutes. Lol?
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:05:43
They are not sitting there for 10 minutes. They are all hashing together for a higher chance to find the next block and be awarded accordingly. Which is 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes. It does not matter if transactions are included or not. What miners basically do is hash blocks that include transactions or not to secure the Bitcoin network. Its a very simple concept to wrap your head around... Not any of this non sence about Iran using the Bitcoin miners for nuclear simulation.. If that were the case, the USA would of made sure Bitcoin would be dead. But sure, Bitcoin is a super computer of sort. But not in the way you are describing it. I really hope your just trolling or are new.

Seriously, who gives one flying fuck about craig wright? Focus on bitcoin, not faketoshi who has no fucking proof. Remember that he is the one who caused your btc price to drop from ATH. Since he has been in the crypto space, he has caused nothing but drama and uncertainty. Best way to do away with him is just to IGNORE.
@_date: 2019-12-01 03:41:58
And so what? Mining pools have a crap ton of hashes in the network too! What makes them different now compared to google and amazon? That's not even a good comparison... All three of these comments  feel so low balled to me. I feel like you guys have been spoon fed shit information.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:14:51
Have you looked at the code for Bitcoin? Its for everyone to see on github. Find me a line of code that proves what you are saying and than maybe we can start speculating of the horrible things Bitcoin can do. Also Iran is for Bitcoin for one simple reason. THE US SANCTIONS. Its lets them get around the sanctions the USA and other countries have put on them.
And i can't hook up my computer. Most Bitcoin mining is done with ASIC's these days. And good luck running a simulation on those lol. Also, China has 60%~ of the Bitcoin hashing power... Sooo yea.

You will look back at this moment in a few years and think of why in the hell you sold. Just remember that. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 20:25:45
You dont have to look far. AltCoins. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:38:14
If I were you, i would at least wait for the bottom  before buying more. I mean imagine you invest at these levels and it tanks to 1k.... Wouldn't you want to wait for 1k to accumulate more? 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:06:16
No more trading for bch on coinbase. I find that funny. Also, it seems to me that the hardfork is causing more problems for BCH than creating solutions. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:37:34
If they say sell, buy.
If they say buy, buy.
If in doubt, close your eyes and HODL. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:07:01
Oh, i thought i would be first to post it. Too bad.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:51:11
Im not timing the market, Im just seeing the market drop off by 18 BILLION dollars in just 2 days....
You think thats a good time to take a loan out (when you have no other money) and invest into Bitcoin? lol 
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:41:02
More like "The wake up call, governed paper backed money is retarded" 
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:43:30
No, I'm just looking out for someone that i don't even know and that might be making a big mistake. If you buy now, i think your in for a hard time till we hit bottom around 1-2k.
@_date: 2018-11-09 10:32:52
In your dreams. Im not fucking selling! 
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:04:53
Not about the money, its about proving everyone in disbelief about Bitcoin wrong. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:28:05
Let me just say it like this.. Normally, its advised to not take tax advice from strangers online.
HOWEVER! not declaring taxes on capital gains (since you are reverting your btc to a form of fiat currency) is illegal. Its falls under money laundering (since bitcoin is still new to governments and that they dont understand much of what it is yet or how to trace certain transactions.. When its public to them lol) and tax evasion.
So with that said.. You dont have the receipts or any information relating to the transactions. All you have to do is 1. Know how much you put in TOTAL! 2. Know the capital gains tax in your country.
Then, detuct that percentage from the GAINS you have made, not the initial investment. And then and only then you write that number on your taxes in the appropriate field.
If they ask you for proof, retrace your btc transactions from the exchanges you used. All exchanges have your transaction history.
One last thing.. Dont be stupid and think they wont ever be able to trace your bitcoin transactions. One day, you might get bad news. 
Your welcome :)
