This is good for Bitcoin. No more mining centralization.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:58:29
Yes it's correct. 
You cannot receive more money through Lightning in one transaction than the sum of your payment channels values.

@_date: 2017-08-31 11:25:39
Trezor and Ledger are supporting SegWit. Electrum will add support in the next update. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:59:19

You can burn BTC by sending it here: 
They're not deleted but there is no private key to this adress.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:27:24
People hodling = low supply = price goes up
@_date: 2019-04-24 08:37:22
You send BTC to an unspendable address. There is no known private key. 
For example: [
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:08:54
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:29:37
4000 on Bitfinex
@_date: 2017-04-18 06:58:48
People can't withdraw USD from Bitfinex so they buy and withdraw BTC.  That causes the price to rise.

Do you realize this is an exchange cold wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:38:10
You don't need bad news for the price to fall.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:24:28
And you can't even pay with Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:53:51
Two things: 
- It should update every second, not minute.
- You should add exchange names on the price boxes.

That's why you should always remain emotionless while investing.

It's not priceless, it's worth $8722 at the moment.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:28:30
Because they mined more blocks.
BCash  is 1415 blocks ahead of the original chain.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:58:42
So you think moving from a stock market that drop 3% to BTC that can drop 60% in one month is a wise choice?
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:45:55

I think it's too violate to be a currency.
I was buying some stuff with BTC yesterday.
The problem was once the payment got confirmed, the value of BTC dropped and I had to make another transaction to add the missing value.
Edit: spelling
