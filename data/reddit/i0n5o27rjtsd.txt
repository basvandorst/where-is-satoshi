I tried to quicksend.
Cut and pasted.




I just went into import/export. I clicked on "Export Encrypted" and it said "Below are your private keys AES encrypted" followed by a kajillion digit key. Now what?

I can't believe how complicated this is.
I went to blockchain and tried to send money to the address I created. I got a message saying I had insufficient funds, I suppose for the fee. I pressed a button that said "adjust amount", which I assumes subtracts the fee, and then got asked for my private key again. Which is where I started.
What am I doing wrong?

I went to and sent a message for "balance" and "history". How long does it take to get a response?

Yup. Funny story. The "Captcha" was "ezpzee". 
Now that I'm an expert, tomorrow I'll do some mining.
Thanks again

Someone sent it to me on reddit a few months ago. I saved the blockchain webpage as a bookmark. If there was more info I should have saved, I didn't know it at the time.
Really, I just forgot about it. I think it was less than a buck then. It's up to $25 now. But it's not money I worked for, so it's not a tragedy. It could be worse. I could have been that guy who threw away the hard drive with $7,000,000 and now it's in a landfill. So there's that.
Thanks for trying to help me out. I appreciate it.

You never know. Could go either way.

Someone sent them to me to blockchain. I with great difficulty managed to import them into a blockchain wallet. I may well have imported them as watch only, whatever that means. If I wanted to import it normally, I still need my private key, right? Where can I find it? 
This is easy once you know how, right?

The address I used starts with a 1. I checked the original page and there is nothing there beginning with a 5 or 6. There's a "hash 160" string that begins with a 2.
Am I out this money without a private key? It's not a lot, but still.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:26:19
I'll give that a shot. Thanks.

I did it! I created a new wallet from and then went through the process again. It didn't ask for a private key, I guess that happens behind the scenes. This time the transfer went through.
Thanks for your help.

That's what they said about Enron and Lehman Brothers.

You make it sound so easy. See the rest of the thread.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:08:39
I knew that. I'm an expert, remember?
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:40:18
Thanks for answering.


I did that and it asks me to enter an email address. Which email address?
How much of a fee?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:21:45
Could you break that down for me?
