[Blockonomics]( will be glad to help them accept Bitcoin without any fees on their website.

I think [Blockonomics]( would be the right fit as it ticks all the three check boxes. It is pretty easy to use free Wordpress plugin and could be installed in less than 4 min. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:26:14
It is amongst one of Blockonomics' most important priorities and we plan to implement it very soon.

Wow! It is kinda scary to imagine a whole population's salary and saving losing its value for no fault of theirs. 
I know it will take some time but I hope things will get better.

Thanks, appreciate it!

I am not sure about the tax aspects. Maybe someone here could help out. 
I've heard it is being sold at price many times multiple to general rates in Iran etc., A decentralized fiat solution is equally important.

Can you talk about the biggest changes you have experienced since the crisis become magnified?

Blockonomics is exactly that. Although it may seem like an institution, at no point in time it participates or regulates the transaction.
Its system uses Xpub key to generate addresses for merchant and BTC goes directly from customer's wallet to merchant's wallet giving them total control of their finances.
Although being an intermediary can allow a payment gateway to have a lot more features which are often demanded by merchants, Blockonomics has always kept principles of Bitcoin at its core and gives merchants complete control of their BTC. All of this for a 5 min installation unlike BTCpay installing which is a bit more technically involved process and perhaps not for everyone.

Great to hear that! [Blockonomics]( would be glad to cover your payment fees. DM me and we will help you set\-up your gateway.

First Wikileaks shop and now Expedia. I wonder how a revolutionary journalism merchandise company and an air tickets company has wronged Coinbase. Why are they suppressing adoption?

Here is a demo of how a Bitcoin payment check out would work:

This [blog]( lists all the options with pros and cons for each.

Shouldn't hold barts inside. Let'em out. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:38:48
It is primarily that i suppose.

Spend and Replace \(SAR\) should get as much attention as other jargon.

Will it be manipulation if all of the hundreds and thousands of believers decide to push the price up at a co\-ordinated time? It seems like a dangerous idea but man that would be fun. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 08:07:19
\(For the record\)
@_date: 2018-06-02 08:29:41
The skeptical me is pretty sure that a lot of this is happening. But the optimist me tends to think that in the middle of these manipulative spikes and falls there is also a volume of resurgence somewhere hidden in there.
@_date: 2018-06-25 09:43:28
Well that is not possible anytime soon. But there is Blockonomics - completely permissionless, decentralized and you will forget it once you've installed it : [
