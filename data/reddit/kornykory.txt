I'd start even lower, at 0.03

I want to basically send a link. I want to buy a physical greeting card and create a QR code for the link and put that in the card. 
Thanks for that link though. It is helpful.

Reddiqutte? But I agree with stickying the faq again. It is helpful. I'm one of the noobs that you're talking about but I'm not a dumbass and I know how to lurk. 
But that may be because I've been on reddit for a couple years now.

It's on the bacon reader app. Once in the sub hit the buttons in the bottom right and click view sidebar.

Now if I can just get enough adfly clicks to get a pay out ha ha
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:17:13
I'll check out woo commerce when I get to work. 
So it's like a marketplace that I set up? Is it free? Is it something that I can use with wix.com? I've started building my site on there. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:20:46
Thank you. Does that site try the sites or just have other people give them reviews?
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:12:43
Oh thanks! I was looking from mobile, guess I missed it.

647 is a Westminster, SC number as well. I thought this was from my hometown for a second.
@_date: 2016-06-01 13:29:43
Awesome! Thank you!
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:13:27
Can I sell multiple quantities and set a shipping fee? I looked at it a little but it seemed kinda confusing. I didn't really want people to have to download a program to buy my stuff as well. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:11:19
I built my website with wix.com. I don't know if plug-ins work there. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:14:24
Thanks! I hate having to start over again but if it's a better experience all around then I'll switch.

I think it's a little extreme to get so upset of the terms. It's like calling the *xbox one* the *xbone*. People we're losing their shit over that too for some reason but to say it's a conspiracy that people are calling bitcoin cash, bcash, because people are just trying to trash the name is a bit much I'd say.
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:28:56
3 hours late for that one... 
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:22:40
That's for buying and selling bitcoin. I want to accept bitcoin for my items. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:54:10
BitCash? 
@_date: 2016-02-23 20:57:25
Er... then I went back and looked and this is the flipside of the coin 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:23:48
Don't worry it will be 6k before you know it
@_date: 2015-11-18 19:08:27
I just had my first link post on there. I got 5 bits for the one upvote... I think it got upvoted... I got 5 bits for someone voting one way or the other lol
@_date: 2015-11-19 05:28:00
I'm not too familiar with zap chain but I have used it a little. I can see how there are some similarities but I don't think they are that closely related. Sato.sh has posts about everything, not just cryptocurrency related articles. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:25:38
So this is your site?
@_date: 2015-11-18 18:42:18
Well there are a lot of post pertaining to bitcoin but you can post anything there. There are news posts and such. It revolves around rewarding users bitcoin for good posts so that is why it has that name.
@_date: 2015-10-16 14:35:14
Yeah a real thief would just take the cell phone and jet
@_date: 2016-05-12 19:11:53
I signed up to test it out. Once I uploaded a video I didn't see any of the other videos. I'm only able to see my video profile. I click the button, type in the url, everything I try takes me to my profile. Only thing I could do is "search" then change the category.

Coinbase uses credit cards now too. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 19:03:02
So there are ads and you can pay to make it ad free?
@_date: 2015-02-02 05:33:52
I saw where  won that last week. 
You must make a lot of money to be able to tip so much. What do you do for a living of you don't mind me asking? 
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:58:35
Yup, got up around 230. I was going to sell mine at 240 but it never got there. Guess I'll hope for a mid week spike. Now (~220) is a good time to buy more if you got some cash.
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:54:17
I believe you can on their exchange but not on the app 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:40:47




It's amazing what people will write on public profiles.
@_date: 2015-02-01 06:36:43
From what I have noticed the weekend the price seems to drop on the weekend. If exchange doesn't work just add cash to your usd wallet and then buy when the price is right. 
I just bought $50 worth today. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:56:36
Bits everywhere!
@_date: 2016-05-12 19:17:28
Someone once told me bitcoin isn't real
I told the guy to just chill
Paper cash is backed by imagination
It changes with inflation
Then I used my Shift card to pay for my meal
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:55:40
Hey OP I have just started using it. Deposited 0.01 bits. Hasn't shown up yet. Will update you though. If you want to be a cool guy you can click my [link]( :) 
The 0.01 ended up in there. The payout slowed down.
** Payout went sped up
*** By my calculations at current pay rate. Assuming that you do this on point for 18 hours a day for 1 month you'll have 0.063504 btc... That's without upgrading
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:10:40
Have some on me too! 50 bits
