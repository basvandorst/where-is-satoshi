This is exactly what I think it is. I'm sure we all dealt with bank bullshit for years with bullshit fees and policies made to maximize fees like the process order being largest value to lowest value to create a cascade of overdraft fees if a transaction causes a negative balance.
I've had it happen too many times to count, and it mostly was due to incorrect balance reporting by the banks, to which they reply that I should be taking better care to keep a balance sheet, knowing well that almost everyone has a number of services automatically deducting funds every month, some more predictable than others.
My last overdraft cascade came from a bank error. They first charged a check bounce fee, even though the funds were available for the check. That in turn the next day caused another larger transaction that had been authorized days prior to cause an overdraft, which then with the fees accessed caused all the other previously authorized transactions to all overdraft.
Suddenly, because of their error, I had about 5 or 6 overdrafts, plummeting my account in to the negative. I called up pissed off and told them that they made the error, that the funds were indeed available.
They responded that there was about an hour between the incoming funds being available and the check being processed. They already had known these incoming funds were there, they displayed it as received online, but they just decided to process it later on the books to cause an overdraft situation for the check and the 5 or 6 transactions that were already authorized.
In the end, they reversed all but one of the fees, admitted to the error. But this type of selectively manipulating the account transaction processing times to cause such event nets them $2 BILLION dollars a year at JPMorgan, $1.8 BILLION at Wells Fargo, and $1.7 BILLION dollars at Bank of America.
They make serious income off of stealing money from people, and targeting especially those that have lower balances which often are the poorest.
It's corrupt to charge $35 to $40 per transaction, especially if the transaction is less that $10. The UK government tried to come down on overdraft fees, but apparently from what I've learned recently, all the forward progress the government meant to protect account holders from these predatory and unjust fees have been reversed. Still, I believe the outcome in the UK is that the fees must be more proportional, so charging $35 for a $6 transaction wouldn't fly in the UK, but it certainly does in the US.

So, effectively, the fee was 12.2% to purchase. I've been wondering about the whole automated weekly purchases that people do for small amounts and if the fees would be worth it rather than just buying a larger value in greater intervals.
I've switched to GDAX bank account transfers, though it took 4 days to get in to my account to actually be able to buy, and the price has soared since effectively making paying the fee better than waiting a week.

Regarding the transaction fees and processing time, these are challenges that are actively being worked on. The Lightning Network is a possible solution, and SegWit is one that has been developed, but not universally adopted.
As for power consumption, the idea is that technology will improve to keep up. We saw the absorption of the GTX 1070 and 1080 cards being used by miners, and shortly after the ASICs took over making the GPU mining obsolete for Bitcoin, but still doable for altcoins.
What Bitcoin, and potentially any other successful crypto, demands is that industry keep up with it. It's a motivator and perhaps will have a side-effect of fueling the need for solar and wind power as well as advancing technology.
It's like Bitcoin is **the** proof-positive test run that never got shutdown. It also is the best testing ground for real-world high demand blockchain usage. Regardless of the debate whether it is or will be ever a currency, or whether it is a huge bubble, it is possibly the most important live experiment we have going in the financial world today.
That being said, many see the importance of what it is beyond the market value, many bank on it being a paradigm shift in global economy. It's still early adoption, and the growing pains are more than present, but everyday, more smartypants people are working on solving the problems.
Now, the surface benefit is that we stand to make profit off this experiment in that the value has had a trend to increase overall in time. Economists are divided, but I can't help but to think that it truly will soar in 2018, so I'm going in heavy (I have little to lose if it bottoms out, I'm very resilient to loss).
There is so much positive about Bitcoin happening right now. I knew better to get in years ago, and have been kicking myself for a good solid month because it took me this long to get in. I tried before, but it was too confusing for me at the time I looked at it 7 years ago.

My basic point wasn't that Bitcoin will make everyone millionaires, but that the US dollar is an inflationary currency with built inflation that is fairly consistent over time.
Basically, the longer you hold USD, the less it is worth, so investing it in something that might have a return could help offset the ever declining worth of the USD.

It's called load balancing, and apparently GDAX failed to set it up correctly or haven't allowed it to provision enough server instances.
I thought they used AWS at first, but realize it's actually Cloudflare, so here is the URL to Cloudflare's load balancing info:
I personally suggest AWS, deploying via Elastic Beanstalk on load balanced t2 server instances (which credit for lower process demand), with the database being delivered by RDS all within a VPC.

I also have an Excel spreadsheet open that has all my BTC transactions in it and tells me exactly how much profit/loss I have in USD and percentage as well as the current worth of my Bitcoin. It auto-updates every minute, so I'll glance over at it from time to time, or use it to see what return a buy will have.

@_date: 2017-11-27 23:55:57
If you by via GDAX through the bank account transfer, you will have to wait several business days before the funds are available - unless you do a wire transfer which costs $10 via GDAX for the incoming wire and whatever your bank charges for an outgoing wire ($35 or so). The wire is "immediate" if processed before the bank cutoff (around 2pm) or the next day.
The deal is that the price is volatile and could potentially continue to rise before your funds are available, meaning 1 BTC would cost you potentially $100 to $200 more than if you bought it now - and by the same token, it could drop by the time the your funds are available. So, any fees you pay could completely be not worth thinking about since you are planning on investing $10,000. So wiring the funds in would be the best way to have quick access to purchasing 1 BTC, and those funds would still be USD, so you could wait for a dip or buy right away.
Coinbase is GDAX's simplified site and allows you to make immediate purchases, locking in the price. The buy price is always slightly higher than market price via GDAX, so you pay more via Coinbase and pay fees.

1. Nasdaq announced today that they will offer Bitcoin futures.
2. CME Group (largest futures market in the world) will start trading Bitcoin futures in December as announced a month ago.
3. Square is doing a pilot program with some users to allow them to trade Bitcoin.
4. Bitcoin has set new high records several times this month.
Do you think the price will rise or drop before 2018?
I think you missed your best chance to buy in a few minutes ago in the dip. You can wait for another dip, but that might come after the price rises to $15,000 and dips to $11,000. Or it could drop to $5,000 again. It's really up to your best bet based on the research that you do.
Personally, I think buying in with a small amount now at any price would be worth it to just get in. Sit on it and wait for dips to buy in more.

To be honest, I'm not sure on it, but I'd imagine with enough support it should distribute the weight properly and be fine. There are also different types of materials, plastics, metals, and even wood pulp, one of which would out perform the others.
I saw a Youtube video of 3D printed boat propellers and some tore, most ground out in the center, and surprisingly the lacquered wood bested the plastics - though the winner was a special process that isn't easy to pull off.
For myself, I'm drawing up a stand that will act as stand and an organizer for pens, and such. But I don't have the weight that you'll have. But still, you most likely could fit in some sleek pen holders without compromising load stability.

Not necessarily. I have an insane metabolism and can not gain fat. The most I ever weighed was 160 lbs for a few days before getting sick, but to to so, I had to go to the gym 3 or 4 times a week to gain muscle mass and eat 4 plates of food at a buffet.
I got sick (cold) right after, and my edema (swollen ankles) was problematic and liver levels were spiking. I stopped working out for a few months and lost 10 lbs.
If I stop going to the gym, I'll eventually return to my "normal" weight of 130 lbs no matter how much I eat. If I really forced myself, I'd die of liver failure probably before I ever got fat.

Assuming Mike is right, $3000 * 4 = $12,000. Not a bad return. Even if it only makes it to $20,000, you still "win". Also, Etherium is worth investing in too, so it might be worth while to put some funds in Etherium, which is only a FEW MONTHS OLD.

"JPMorgan made close to $2 billion from overdraft charges last year. Wells Fargo made $1.8 billion, and Bank of America made $1.7 billion on overdraft fees." - CNN Money
I don't need to go in to the absurdity of overdraft charges - anyone that dealt with them already knows. They are exploitative and unbalanced, and make the banks a huge amount of money.
If you do overdraft, or worse have a cascading overdraft situation in which they pay the most expensive item first regardless of time purchased and they hit you with fees for multiple small transactions, then contact the bank and fight.
Banks usually will "forgive" one or two overdrafts a year, and I've caught them recently trying to give me $200+ in fees due to **their error** and had them reverse all of the fees except one.

Yes, but funding GDAX takes 4 business days by direct account payments, but wires are much faster but cost money to use, so only make sense for large amounts.
So, if you are looking to make an immediate purchase, you might be stuck using Coinbase. If you are wiring a large amount or are fine with waiting for the funds to be available to trade with, then fund GDAX and buy via GDAX.
Also, there is no fee for transferring between your GDAX and Coinbase accounts, it's pretty much instant too.

It's just three images, one is the tool, another is the with the band employed, and the third is what it looks like after the testicles and scrotum have been removed. It's not terribly gory, though the last image may be disturbing.
Beyond that, there is a description of the tool and it's use.

Thanks for the answers.
I do realize there are other options for wallets, just specified the one I used since Coinbase doesn't have a way to import from paper at the moment.
As for the QR codes not matching, nope, I'm looking at the correct QR code and it doesn't match the one shown on blockchain.info. I did, though, scan both in the Blockchain app and although different, both resulted in the same Bitcoin Address. I assume this is due to different checksums being used in the QR code.
So, the only question I still have is: How can you verify that your Bitcoin Address and private key match? I feel there must be a script out there similar to the bitaddress.org script that confirms whether or not a key matches the address.

As a new Coinbase user, after you buy, it will take about 8 days before you get access to your Bitcoin, so not immediate trading.
Their sister site GDAX.com allows you to deposit funds with them which you can then use to trade with, but it a more complex system, though has ways of missing out on fees. The thing with GDAX is that funding your account via ACH takes about 4 **business days** for funds to available. You could do a wire as well, for more immediate funding, but that will incur wire transfer fees from your bank and I think GDAX charges a wire receiving fee if under $1000.
So, Coinbase for immediate entry, and GDAX once you feel you feel comfortable.

I was right on it, and cheering. Until Coinbase crashed and failed to let me buy at 87xx. Or 88xx. Or... hell, I missed the dip.

Point is simple: Fiat currencies are almost always devaluing by inflation over time, where Bitcoin's as a currency has had a trend to increase in value over time.

Sorry that your post didn't get as many upvotes. It seems you forgot to attach a meme to make people upvote it. (Yeah, I'm annoyed with all the memes filling the sub.)
I've been watching GDAX, and last night there was a huge shelf of about 210 BTC waiting to be sold at 9200. Once that popped, it's been a nutso drive for 10,000.
There is another huge shelf at 9500, so expect that we will see that today.

Coinbase is a good way start for small purchases, but their sister site GDAX is what you would do well with. Wire in the money to have it available as soon as possible, then you place orders for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin while avoiding fees.
There are some great Youtube videos on how to effectively use GDAX.
Then research cold storage, most seem to go with Trezor for the ease of storing on a digital device, but also make a paper copy as well. Don't lose your Trezor password, or you'll lose access to your money.
Research, research, research.

I put this together for myself to have a quick idea of what the value of my Bitcoin will be based on the Buy and Sell values. This doesn't take in to account fees, inflation, or anything else, so it's just to get a rough idea.
For example, I bought $100, so I stick it in cell Q2. It was bought at 7060, so round to 7100, and then look at current value of 6500. My $100 USD buy is worth about $8.40 less at the 6500.

I had a client offer to pay in Bitcoin in those first few years, I could have been a millionaire had I accepted it **and** held. Chances are, though, I would have converted it to USD shortly after so, 20/20.

Simple, only went in a small amount, $100. I'm going long and expecting a few years down the road for a return. If it drops to $5000 or $4000, I'll dump way more in.

You realize that castration happens everyday on farm animals? There are also humans that do it as part of extreme body modification usually using an Elastrator, a high tension rubber band that cuts off the blood flow to the testicles and scrotum, and after hours of pain, the skin and testicles are dead and can be cut off without any further pain.

They know how many people are signing up, so they should be increasing their system accordingly to be able to handle spikes in traffic. It is something to blame them for, as they surely have access to data that tells them the usage and due to the large probability of a spike, to have extra resources already running to accommodate.
It's not wrong to bitch and moan, it is making it clear that we demand better service. They did a maintenance window late last night, and claim it was to deal with the issue. Hopefully they have taken the necessary steps to ensure high availability.

Basically, all Bitcoin is "stored" in accounts. These accounts are identified by two pieces, the Bitcoin Address and the Private Key.
The Bitcoin Address is used for receiving Bitcoin payments, where the Private Key allows anyone full access to withdraw from the account, so you should **never share your Private Key with anyone**.
To make payments, the Private Key must be provided. Since this is dangerous, as they payee now has your Private Key and could clean out the balance of your account. So, every time a payment is made, the entire balance must be moved.
This is where a wallet service like Coinbase comes in - they are considered a safe place to move your Bitcoin to temporarily. Coinbase and other wallets manage a Bitcoin Address and Private Key for you behind the scenes, and every time you make a payment from your Coinbase wallet, they do all the work in moving your funds to a new Bitcoin account and making the payment to the party you wish to pay.
So, rather than run the risk of Coinbase getting hacked and losing all your Bitcoin, you can pay your Coinbase balance to your own Bitcoin address which you create using a tool like bitaddress.org. By doing so, your Bitcoin is then in "cold storage", which could be a paper wallet (literally the Bitcoin Address and Private Key on a piece of paper) or a USB hardware wallet.
When you make a purchase of Bitcoin, you are charged a fee, so buying $5 would be a really stupid thing to do as you would pay just as much in fees. Also, if you bought $5 worth of Bitcoin valued at $6,000, even if Bitcoin raised to $12,000, you would have less than $10 of value as there are fees involved. So, don't bother with $5 worth, you'll never benefit from it.

I do the same exact thing. I've caught spam coming in to addresses that only existed it the outside company's database, and not on my server.
Years ago, I caught Tiger Direct doing this. I know this because two weeks after completing an order, I started getting 10 to 20 spam emails to tigerdirect
1. I never used that email address ever before
2. I entered the email address in to their system which was using SSL
3. I retrieve mail through an SSL protected connection
4. I keep all spam and have a custom spam search that will allow me to find if anyone ever sent mail to a particular email address prior, and of course, never before
So I called Tiger Direct, spoke with someone that said, "everyone and my mom knows that just having an email address you'll get spam". I told him, I don't have an email address, that the server is set up with a catch-all, so only they could possibly have been spamming me unless they had a data breach coincidentally after I ordered.
I believe I threatened to go to small claims court. He then got abusive, and since I wouldn't tell him my name, he tried using the phone number that CallerID gave, which was wrong (maybe it was a VOIP portal number), and started naming of "my" personal details.
I then pointed out that was not me, but now he's breaking privacy and giving me someone else's personal information.
Funny thing, that email address stopped receiving spam right after. It went from 10 to 20 junk spam to none. So, this told me that they most likely have been running a spamming operation to most likely make back some of the money they lose in the price wars.
Sounds like you caught them.
