The internet is tubes.

I’ve seen fees larger than that.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:34:45
the store of value is a result of the fees. no one wants to move it around cause of what they lose when they do. Even if these scaling solutions are deployed, i don’t see it returning to use as a currency and I don’t see many of these altcoins with goals of being an exchangeable currency. 
I think those days are over and corporate has kind of filled that void with things like square cash and Venmo. Which charge you fees but it’s “fun and instant” and there is no learning curve.
Crypto community has also kind of moved on to thinking more about private transactions and to disrupt other industries like healthcare, legal, and IoT. 
Generally Bitcoin is a testing ground for altcoins of what to do and what not to do. It’s a roll with the punches kind of thing. I don’t think it’s going anywhere but it will definitely look different in a year or two. For all my negative sounding opinions I’m pretty optimistic about it’s longevity.

Just saying I came up with this idea before Cryptokitties
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:09:32
There’s only one rule don’t trust anyone.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:50:28
I might be controversial in saying so but Bitcoin shouldn’t scale. Let the whales flood someone else’s swimming pool.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:05:37
Yes I think the whales and high frequency traders are the problem. The network works when you don’t have the make it rich crowd. Right now the network just doesn’t work also all of the solutions proposed for scaling are incredibly stupid. They all sat around and all they could come up with is “what fixes blocked up blockchain? MOAR BLOCKCHAINS!!!1”. Side chaining, block lattice, lightning. It’s more useless network entities added to your transactions. More places for things to fuck up.

If you use it to buy another asset like a Tesla/Lambo with your crypto instead of converting it to fiat?
If you cash out in smaller amounts, are you safe from having to report capital gains ?

What if, it’s like that time PayPal released an app called “totally cool and not PayPal” *cough venmo* that lets me pay my friends and send them emojis and it also carried a hella fun 3% fee for every transaction. Super great! ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:19:30
General rule- there’s always a fee
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:29:46
Guy wins the lottery, must be a genius. He has this mentality that because he’s rich people should care what he has to say. He’s a hard worker with shit for goals. 
Bitcoin if you really believe in the technology and that it should be decentralized doesn’t care about a community or user experience or trade price it cares about one thing processing transactions and confirming them cryptographically everything else is just nonsense. Here’s what everyone can do to solve this whole issue...stop being sheep ��. Make decisions for yourself choose the network you want for you nothing else matters. 
This is the point of bitcoin and crypto as a whole for you to make the decision that’s best for what you want. Fuck what anyone else says and how much money they have make an actually thoughtful decision on what you spend your money on. If it takes you to the moon great, if not at least you learned something *(hopefully)*.

Your dream is called iota ... you’re welcome
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:11:55
The sheep statement is about the mass of people here just asking where to put their money and not willing to put the time into research or learn about what is happening in the space. the scammers know it and they are the wolves feeding off of people so easily separated from their money. I’m not saying that the community isn’t helpful with answering questions and navigating pitfalls but when you start talking about regulating the rules and behavior of bitcoin it is sounds like centralization to me.
The novelty of this technology is that it can accomplish its transactional goals and navigate trust in a very secure fashion. It does this by not caring who you are and what you’re about. Each member of the transaction is equal. 
I don’t understand the devolution of your comment to a personal attack about my personality or character. I’m just throwing out my two cents here if you disagree that’s fine but argue with me about the topic not some perceived notion you get about me from a few lines of text on reddit.

Coinbase does take an exorbitant time to process a money transfer. But they say it’s all in the name of security.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:30:52
They are Dutch which makes them like most Western Europeans frugal, judgmental and skeptical of things that aren’t organized from centralized authority.

Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it ;)

Possibly something from UAE called [BitOasis](bitoasis.net). I’ve only used bitcoin in Israel while traveling.

They have the internet in France so yes it’s just as easy to exchange.

Has anyone listed what the advantages of fixing something that isn't broken are?
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:01:40
Well my idea is to put the code near the inner wrist on the right sleeve. So like if you went to shake someone’s hand or something they’d be like whoa what’s that?
I like your idea for the athletes but would probably work better for something like track betting. You could run some smart contracts that pay out to the winners addresses. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:49:08
None, they’re all scams.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:18:23
Completely normal

If you want to operate in strictly bitcoin and don’t exchange it for fiat you never lose except to fees.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:57:22
You should probably also move your coin to private wallets off the exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, GDAX, Etc) if you aren’t actively trading them.

His sassy walk when he explains this makes me laugh every time.

I’ve heard Andreas Antonopoulos talk about implementing blockchain in philanthropy to track the money through the organization and see what projects your block of money wound up funding. This was on Kevin Rose’s podcast, [The Kevin Rose Show](
For TV/YouTube it’s easy enough to just throw a watermark in the corner, or the description, or in the credits/on next card, or add a sequence to your video speaking about the fund/sponsor like most do for Patreon/SquareSpace/Audible.
For podcasts and blog posts, put it in the show notes/description
It’s easy to just post these things up and get people asking questions and start conversations. It’s just the disinformation campaign about what bitcoin is and what it’s for has a lot more money behind it. So most people are just hodling and waiting for cryptocurrency prove the loudest voices wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:46:05
This is a case of fundamentally misunderstanding why cryptocurrency exists. When you put this technology in the context of state identity and citizens you lose what makes it so ideal. The concept is to empower the individual to be independent of the collective, organization, corporation, or government.
EDIT: Ethereum is an exception to my premise which instead wants to empower virtual corporations to be our robot overlords.

Let your cash account go down to 20$ it will magically disappear
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:11:24
*if you’re doing high volume (&gt;200$) trades. 
Their limits are extremely picky and all the left over micro transactions are basically shoveled into their money bags 
It can be the best if you’re used to bad accounting and money going missing for no reason.
