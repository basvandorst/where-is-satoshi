Heaven forbid healthy debate should ensue from an article being read when you can just start throwing chairs and shouting immediately instead.

May I suggest some safety goggles? The underlying narrative is that all naysayers are sat on the sidelines telling everyone BTC is a bubble. They don't give a timescale, just sit and wait to say 'I told you so'.
Essentially, anyone can be a smart arse, and all markets are in a perpetual state of bubbling. The expert opinion is the one that operates within this realm, yet knows when to get out before the market contracts.

What evidence are you looking for? The idea of the article is to show that saying bubble constantly does not a bubble make. 
The idea is to suggest that all markets are in a state of bubbling at any given time; calling when the bubble bursts is where the real skill lies, not merely saying 'bitcoin is a bubble' for the last 3 years without committing to a timescale for contraction.

And thanks for the feedback. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:24:53
Lol. Did you read the article?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:35:34
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:46:48
Yep, that pretty much sums up the article.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:50:50
That's open to interpretation. I personally don't think so, but the argument for 'intrinsic value' could suggest otherwise.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:03:01
Wow. All that hard work creating a new platform that could advance the freedom of all, and we've finally reached our zenith.
What a time to be alive.

Precisely - this whole 'qualified investor' stance by regulatory bodies is essentially the establishment saying 'STOP MAKING MONEY, PLEBS!!!' No billionaires want crypto-punks sullying their rarified air now, do they?
We'd best all get back to our station and stop upsetting the 1% by outrageously making money through bitcoin and the Blockchain economy.
Who do we think we are?

And yet the conventional wisdom is to invest in stocks and shares. There's never any issues with manipulation of value or absconding with invested dollars in those markets.
What, 'Enron scandal'? What does that mean??
As previously stated, a terrible article with no research and probable ulterior motive.
It may as well read 'Don't do anything new - if it was that good it would exist already. Just keep doing what you've always done and get what you've always got' etc etc
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:50:51
Extrapolate that to 'don't buy anything if you don't know how to store it safely'.
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:23:52
Thanks. And yes, a rising tide etc. I think it's pretty clear that market cycles in Crypto are hyper and stock markets move like glaciers in comparison. Although the stock market does look like it's entering a bearish period as per the market cycle.

Your dad is four-T-four.

I thought along these lines too, and the comparison of crypto to M1 supply. But then it became apparent- mainstream media, banks and regulators have been telling all that would listen for almost a decade that cryptocurrency is a perfect tool for money laundering. 
If it is that great, why aren't all criminal proceeds laundered with it?
The answer is, because it's a lot easier to track than cash. So criminals deal in fiat because its tougher to trace than crypto. But that doesn't fit the narrative so instead we get headlines saying 'billions laundered in crypto' instead of 'criminals actually use fiat for laundering'.

I find cold storage unless you're day trading with them. And don't brag about how much you've got, because not Venture cold storage can stop you getting turned over if everyone knows how rich you are in an anonymous asset.
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:22:36
What for?
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:52:48
Lol. Buy high, sell low. I see this isn't your first rodeo.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:50:28
Your license fee was singularly hypothecated to make this FUD headline.
You must be mortified.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:13:22
Yeah, the headline seems totally sensationalist when you consider the fact crypto is only responsible for 3-4bn out of 100bn in laundered money. 
You can trace most crypto-transactions anyway, hence why the criminal fraternity seem to avoid bitcoin.
If it worked as well as banks and media make out it does for money laundering, they wouldn't be able to put a figure on it and every criminal would use it.

Wow, thanks for the gold. 1st one!!!
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:09:59
Yep. And you should have known it was coming in 2017.
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:12:51
Touché 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:11:37
Pretty sure he's at the start too!!!
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:34:00
Nope
