Not poopooing what you’ve done, but one part of your analysis is off. The equity in your house is most certainly appreciating. Real Estate typically gains 5% or so annually (possibly much higher in the right areas). So that equity wasn’t just sitting there doing nothing. Also, when you’re computing your rate of return on your investment you need to deduct the interest portion of your loan payments.

Your second paragraph is exactly where logic led me as well. I would have to think that interest rates (the % on the loan itself) would have to be lower to account for the deflation. Just as today they are increased to account for inflation. I haven’t thought through it yet, but there would be some interesting things going on with deflation risk and who holds that risk (borrower or lender).
Just a topic I haven’t seen discussed. Thanks for being the only response that came even close to addressing the issue I was exploring.
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:29:09
You’re seriously hanging your hat on this bullshit. How about you provide a single source showing your definition is correct or even another use of the term by ANYONE? 
Do you want to make any points about not being 100% exposed with your idiotic loan scenario? Or are you conceding that you’re completely wrong on that point as well?
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:44:25
That’s not at all what your first post said lol. And this second one still doesn’t address how loans would be affected by an environment with deflationary currency. “Banks and loans can function on top of bitcoin” isn’t really saying much of anything. 
I would agree that it is unlikely fiat will be completely replaced.

Not totally following you. If it’s indistinguishable from HODLing then why would I as an investor take the risk and loan it out?

Again, statements that have very very little substance.
Paragraph  I’m smarter than you and that’s why you don’t understand my incoherent statements.
Paragraph  statement of the obvious, then a claim that my question is soooooo speculative that it’s not worth discussing.
Paragraph  statement that banks will make it work with absolutely no substantive statements as to how their loan business model will be affected.
Brilliant stuff! Also very curious what baseline assumptions/knowledge I’m missing to understand your incoherent statements? Be specific....
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:26:10
Please please please tell me how you “lock in gains” when loaning an asset if you still own the asset and will be repaid with said asset. Seems like you’re still at risk of devaluation as the owner. Is this some special uber intelligencia financial knowledge you learned on Forex that I just don’t understand as a simpleton video gamer?
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:44:52
You’re getting the interest payments! You said this yourself! You just said “essentially mitigating risk” the rest of that sentence is so wrong it’s almost sad.
I love the fact that you avoid the fact that you do t know the meaning of the term locking in gains. And that you completely avoid the fact that you are so fucking wrong about not being 100% exposed. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:35:09
That’s risk mitigation NOT locking in gains bone head. And yes you still would get 100% of any gains because you’re still getting the same fucking asset back! You still have 100% exposure to price fluctuations. Yeezus! I’m out, you’re not as intelligent as you think you are bud
@_date: 2018-09-12 07:30:23
You skipped the part about fast forwarding to a world where bitcoin has replaced fiat. This is a hypothetical question about how business loans (or any loans really) would be affected by having a deflationary currency. Not sure exactly what point you’re trying to make, but it definitely doesn’t address my post.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:37:43
This comment will probably get downvotes to all hell.....are you serious!!! Yes when you invest in a mutual fund and make money you receive a 1099-Div. And yes it is reported to the government even if it’s only $1.  Apparently because it’s bitcoin people think it’s ok to break the law? I just don’t get it. 
Pay your taxes people! 
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:32:35
I agree with a lot of what you said. But I do think that investment will be greatly affected by a deflationary currency likely resulting in lower % rates on loans to account for the higher real interest rate due to deflation. Kind of the inverse of what we have now where loan % are inflated to get a fair after inflation ROI. Wasn’t really trying to get to the “main point”, just trying to think through how things would actually work with business loans (or any loan really) in a bitcoin world if that were to happen.
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:48:06
Why am I arguing with someone that thinks stock splits are similar to central banks printing money? I actually have a finance and law degree and have been a small business owner since I was 23. But yeah stick with the ad hominem attacks when you don’t have anything of value to say. If you have better things to focus on, then why the hell did you respond to my post lol. 
And yes you are totally wrong!!! Loans can absolutely be based on bitcoin in a somewhat stable deflationary value environment. The interest rates would likely just be lower because otherwise the real cost of borrowing money would be prohibitive otherwise. The inverse of our current system where interest rates are naturally inflated to account for inflation. 
Good luck sir. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:19:48
Your exact words dude
“Correct me if I'm wrong, I think I'm understanding that bank loans won't work on bitcoin as its a currency that goes up in value, so banks just hold it rather than loaning it..”
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:03:45
Generally when posing a question you use a ? not..  Or use the phrase “you’re saying” instead of “I’m thinking” to provide a hint that this is a question. I can only interpret your words and punctuation as you poorly use them
And no that is not at all what I’m saying. Funny how you accuse me of putting words in your mouth when that’s EXACTLY what you did. I interpreted your words as I think 9/10 people would.
And lastly, your thought that a bank will loan bitcoin to lock in gains is just silly. They could also sell the bitcoin and achieve the same goal with zero risk. Total nonsense. See some of the other comments and my responses so you can wrap your head around things. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:56:40
Who said anything about loaning without any interest? Just wow man. I can’t even follow your thought process anymore. You’re spinning yourself in all sorts of directions. Locking in profits means selling an asset to realize the gains. Just do a simple google search dude. This doesn’t take a finance degree (not economics). And yes the science of economics is open to debate and disagreement, but financial terms are pretty much used with a meaning attached to them that everyone agrees on. It’s good to see your full idiocy on display though.
I was engaging with you because I was hoping there was something I was missing. Alas, just total nonsense
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:53:10
Accuse? WTF are you even talking about? 
I never said that it wasn’t locking in gains, but rather that isn’t WHY a bank would loan bitcoin in a world where it’s replaced fiat currency as you claim. Again, read my original post and other discussions. You’re way out in left field dude. Trading on Forex means pretty much nothing when it comes to theoretical financial discussions about bitcoin, but good for you ����. I’ve often found that when people don’t have anything of substance to add to a discussion, they engage in ad hominem attacks and other logical fallacies. Your appeal to authority as a Forex trader is laughable. 
Your original comment was based on large fluctuations in bitcoin pricing both up and down. You then claim that a bank would make bitcoin loans to “lock in gains”. HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU LOCKING IN GAINS IF I PAY YOU BACK WITH BITCOIN THAT HAS A 10% LOWER VALUE?! Cause now you’re saying that the bank wants to lock in gains and still own the asset. LMFAO!

And then to further prove how special ed you truly are you claimed that this thing you pulled out of your ass somehow makes you a figurative Jedi and me a figurative padawan.

LMFAO. We’re discussing the equity of a house or investment aspect not the physical house. No one is discussing the utility of the home except for you contradicting yourself to make a comment about something we’re not even talking about.
Differentiated thinking? What the fucking fuck is that. Are you just totally making up your nonsense now? Please provide a google link to something that discusses this so-called differentiated thinking! There is a thing called “Differentiated Instruction” or “Differentiated Learning” but neither of them is even close to what you think it is 
I’d also like to point out the idiocy of your comment from 2 comments ago “if I don’t spend my bitcoin eventually they will become worthless.” Will the world cease to exist when you die? Bitcoins will have no value because u/hanspanzer died?
I will be waiting for an article, or really anything, from anywhere with even a hint of credibility that discusses “differentiated thinking” and that making contradictory statements is somehow a strategy within your newfangled theory of thought.

@_date: 2019-08-24 12:03:18
I think you’re talking about something totally different. What you’re talking about IDK though.
There’s a lot of wealth in the world that is not held in cash. Real Estate being a huge one. If bitcoin replaces cash as the monetary supply, it isn’t replacing the value of all real estate too.
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:14:50
The point is that there are a lot of other lower risk assets you can buy to escape inflation than real estate. Cherry picked the one thing you could poke a small hole in and totally ignore everything else?
@_date: 2019-08-25 18:59:59
Here’s a great chart to educate you. Generally t-bonds and certainly corporate/municipal bonds (lower risk profile than real estate) keep up with inflation. Yes, there’s been an anomaly the last few years. But it’s just that, an anomaly not the general state of affairs. 
People do not generally invest in real estate to escape fiat inflation. It has too many transaction costs, too much risk, and is not liquid enough to be used as a parking place to merely keep up with inflation. I cannot see a scenario where demand for real estate is lower in a bitcoin dominated world than it is with fiat currency. I’m open to being persuaded, but you’re not doing a great job so far.
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:12:37
Er, I think you mean Iceland
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:50:06
And then real estate would become worthless? In order for Bitcoin to replace ALL wealth, then literally nothing else would have ANY value. If that’s what you think is gonna happen, I have a bridge to sell you. 
Also, the efficient distribution of capital is a big deal for healthy economies. Wishing for a world where people just stuff their money in a mattress and no money is loaned or invested would not be a result we’d be happy with.
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:51:35
Speculative demand is not driven by investors “trying to escape fiat inflation”. You can escape fiat inflation by buying bonds or t-bills or any other number of lower risk profile assets. They’re trying to earn a return on their capital. They see people making money buying X and all of a sudden a ton  of people are doing the same thing, buying X, which in turn drives up demand and thus the price of X. Absolutely nothing about that dynamic will be different in a world where bitcoin has replaced fiat. Capital will still search for return and speculative asset bubbles will still be here as will the realities of supply and demand curves.
Real estate’s value (as with most financial assets) is largely derived by the income it produces. Assuming of course it’s not wildly overvalued by an asset bubble situation which is generally the case overall. Is everyone going to all of the sudden start paying less rent? If rents will still be the same and I own a building that I’m getting $20,000/month rent, why would that income stream all of the sudden have less value or utility to me or someone that I would sell the building to? 
You make some very declaratory statements here with absolutely no argument or logic to back them up. “If global bitcoin hard money existed (instead of fiat), some of that speculation value would go into the bitcoin market cap.” LMFAO, come on dude. What mechanism would transfer wealth from a building to a digital coin?
Now you could argue that less capital will be invested overall because people will just sit on their bitcoin due to deflation. This situation could lower the demand curve for real estate and thus lower the price of that asset overall. But I don’t see how that wealth gets “transferred” to the bitcoin market cap as you boldly claim with zero argument or logic. In reality, the scenario you describe is actually wealth destruction. If real estate as an asset class is all of a sudden worth less, that value doesn’t magically get transferred somewhere else. That wealth is gone. If I owned a 100,000 home in 2008 and all of a sudden it was worth 20% less, who got that $20,000?
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:57:56

You’re on an island with this one man. Do you understand that MasterCard and Visa are just networks? Bitcoin is also just a network. You don’t need 2 networks to do transactions. That’s redundant and again goes against a huge feature of bitcoin in that it doesn’t need a 3rd party intermediary skimming a % off transactions on top of the bitcoin network transaction fees. 
Yes, bitcoin or any crypto currency has a long long way to go before mass adoption. But stripping away one of the hugest incentives to actually make the switch to bitcoin damn sure isn’t going to be the thing that causes mass adoption.  Literally no one on this subreddit that understands bitcoin would want Visa or MasterCard anywhere near bitcoin. Bitcoin is the democratization of currency so there is no longer a need for centralized trusted 3rd party actors in our financial system. Again that is a major feature of bitcoin that I don’t think you understand. 
I’d continue this convo, but your anecdotal stories and lack of knowledge aren’t enticing enough. Basically what you’re saying is that people will have a hard time adapting to high speed internet so they’ll stick with their dial up modems because that’s what they know how to use.

That’s a UI issue. Have you ever had to set up merchant services for a small business? It’s not plug and play in the least. Square has actually simplified the UI which is a big part of their success. 
Not using scanables? What does that have to do with anything? If a business can set up merchant services, they can set up the necessary hardware to accept bitcoin. And in the future the tech will be much much easier. The times we’re in with bitcoin and block chain is like 1992 internet. 
Again, I mean absolutely no offense, but I don’t think you understand the fundamentals of bitcoin/crypto/blockchain.

From basic google searching to confirm previous knowledge. Greenland traditionally uses oil and diesel power plants for electricity. They do have a hydro plant and potential for more. But as of now, very little capacity. Also 3/4 of Greenland is covered by an ice sheet.
Iceland on the other hand produces 85% of its energy from domestic renewable sources. And is the largest electricity producer in the world per capita. 
Electricity costs vary widely in Greenland, from .25 cents to .50 cents per kWh depending on the season. Iceland electricity costs .05 cents per kWh. (American dollars)
No one is setting up shop in Greenland, but there are several bitcoin mining operations in Iceland.

Huh? Why do you need MasterCard or Visa for any of that? Or a card? One of the major ideas with block chain is that you don’t need intermediaries.

Yeah except your heirs will inherit it, you can sell your house and rent, reverse mortgages to take advantage of that equity that has gained value, you can borrow more against it because you have more collateral, you can sell it when you’re old to pay for medical bills or nursing home, and most people downgrade homes when they get older.
And guess what! All of these things will still be true in a world dominated by bitcoin. I’ve got another tidbit for you. The point of bitcoin is not as a skyrocketing asset, yes we do happen to be in that unique time in its development where that is what is happening. But bitcoin was not intended to replace the common sense financial move of owning your home and building equity in your property (there are exceptions in some markets). 
Lastly, your comment is kinda silly. If you HODL bitcoin until you die it’s just numbers, you do not really gain anything. See how silly that sounds.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but they’re not at the printing money stage yet. I don’t have a total understanding of the exact mechanics, but I believe this money was loaned overnight and then repaid. Quantitative easing, commonly referred to as the Feds printing money, happens when the Feds go out and actually buy assets and increase bank reserves etc. What happened the last day or so is pretty damn close to QE and has a lot of people rightfully spooked, but they’re not printing money just yet.
