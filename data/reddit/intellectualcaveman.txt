This reminds me a lot of Cryptsy. I had all my BTC there. I lost it all when it disappeared.
When reviews are so shitty, you know the end is near for a company.
I'm in the same boat, deposited funds that didn't get to my account. Deposit shows up, but funds aren't there.
Either way, I'm starting to accept that my funds may be gone. Would I ever put funds in there again? No.
Crazy story for me personally. Never asked my mom (rich) for a loan in my life. In 2013, I asked for 15000 usd to buy 100 bitcoins. She didn't give it to me.
With my own money I did some exchanging on Cryptsy. That disappeared.
After years with a bad taste in my mouth I gave it another go and deposited on NiceHash. A few months later my funds there were gone.
So judging by how shitty my luck is, I really think this might end terribly.

Did you eventually get your problem resolved?

They're trying to find that sweet spot where they can milk the market as much as possible.
The other companies too have increased the prices of their miners.

Thanks for the kind words. I don't put my life into cryptocurrencies so it's ok. Have good things going on for me. Gotta stay future oriented. Think productively.

In re-reading your post, I noticed a similarity (I have the same problem). It was only confirmed on the blockchain a few days after it showed up as deposited as well (low transaction fee).

I have seen zero proof from anybody. At least the m3 miner from pangolinminer.com has some reviews. And I still don't trust that.

Down 5% since you agreed with me. You and me are onto something, but most are too gullible. You see the big picture. You have my respect.

What goes up so fast almost inevitably goes down significantly. How is volatility caused by market manipulation instead of nice stable increases in value a reason to celebrate?

It always happens when you buy BTC. The trick is to never buy and see it go up.
