People are confused because you accidently typed tether instead of ether.  Easy mistake.

No. SabiWabi is the worst person since Hitler.  Do you know what I would do if someone randomly gave me a few thousand dollars?  Neither do I. Now I'll never know.  That bit of human knowledge is now lost forever.  Science just took it up the ass and SabiWabi is to blame.

I bought a car not too long ago so all my extra cash has been going towards paying off that loan early since interest not paid is interest earned.  Of course, that means if I want to invest money, I have to beat a 3.19% return or I'm effectively losing money.  Knowing that has made easy for me to justify not bothering.  It's easier and risk free to just pay off what I owe early.  But maybe next time I see something that makes me think "These people are crazy" then maybe I'll put my money where my mouth is.

I felt pretty confident about both.  I don't know much about investing but I do know technology and I was *knew* everyone predicting doom for Netflix was crazy.   Bitcoins are  obviously riskier, but I've been watching htem since they were well below $1 dollar each, but the MTGOX compromise scared me away from them.  I did eventually make a Dwolla account so I could use a different exchange, but never go around to it.  But if I had bought them, I would have sold them at $30 when this guy was buying.   The current price strikes me as crazy.  Seems like it has to be a bubble . . .

I wanted to buy some back when they were $6 a pop not long ago but I Certainly didn't have the balls (or probably the collateral) to take out a $30k loan. I also wanted to buy Netflix stock after the Quikster debacle when it was super cheap.   Now it's worth more than double.  I really need to stop thinking about doing shit and do it.
