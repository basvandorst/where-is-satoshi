We alleged that 1) BFL violated Kansas Consumer Protection Act 50-623 in part; 2) BFL knowingly made false representations; and 3) BFL engaged in breach of contract, all of which caused injury. We were prepared at trial to present documentation and evidence, and are convinced that our preponderance was greater than anything BFL could produce to the contrary. All attempts to communicate with BFL prior to filing were exhausted, so we had no choice.

Thanks for all the comments. I am impressed by the diversity of opinions. I will try to address certain ones:
As to the default judgment:
-- My atty Mr Stanley Bachman was fully prepared to argue the facts of our case before the court. In his view, BFL, by its own actions, has caused injury. If BFL has determined that it was in its own best interest to not show in court, this was their decision.
-- As to the Bitcoins paid in the initial order:
Mr Bachman thought that the court may not consider recission or payment of claims, fees, or damages in BTCs due to the unfamiliarity of a lower court with the technology. It was his determination to pursue a USD claim. I had always preferred to have my BTCs back, regardless if they were worth 2cents or $1K each. I believe in the BTC movement and the whole purpose of buying mining equipment in the first place was to acquire more BTCs as a longer term investment. Recission is still an option for us in future litigation.
-- As to being a cry baby:
Our complex society requires that people with legitimate grievances participate in a system of laws so that disputes may be resolved according to the rule of law. I am willing to subject the facts of my case to be examined in a public forum of law, and I am willing to yield to its judgment. If I wrong someone, I seek to make restitution because it is just and fair to do so. I do not seek to do harm to BFL, only to resolve my issue and help those who, like me, may have experienced the same kind of perceived injury, and who may want to take lawful, public action to resolve their dispute.
-- As to ever obtaining the garnishment, the Bitcoins, or any kind of resolution:
BFL continues to behave the way it always has: ignoring communications, failing to perform, and-- in our view-- violating Kansas Consumer Protection statutes. My judgment contains interest on the penalties which will continue to accrue as time moves forward. I may never see a dime, but -- in my view-- I had to do something.
-- The facts of my case:
I will make --at my discretion-- copies of my petition available on a case-by-case basis, by request. I have already provided copies to 4 people who wanted to see if their situation matched mine. Any specific questions can be directed to me and I will make attempts to answer and share information to the BTC community.

How do you know this? Do you know where they bank?

Thanks. We used assetresearchcompany.com aka  for part of our search.  They revealed that an account at BoA by BF LABS INC was closed. They continue to monitor electronic existence of accounts using the name BF LABS INC, but have come up with nothing, which indicates that BFL shifts monies around different named accounts.

-- As to the 'default ruling' being a 'win' or not:
If the ruling stands, it is a win. If it is challenged for vacation by BFL, then I look forward to my attorney's ability to argue our case.
Either way, in my view, it is a win. To do nothing, is a losing proposition.

The only thing I see wrong with this analysis (or point of view) is that gold/silver has been completely manipulated through the use of derivative contracts where 1 ounce of gold is "held" by 600 contracts -- all claiming ownership.
-- If Bitcoin is 'prohibited/protected' from a demand for delivery at options' expiration, like gold and silver are today, who knows the results? -- except to say -- BTC will be as controlled as gold and silver.
