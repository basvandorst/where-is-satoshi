No, I base it on all the posts.
The 'no' part looks original, the 'coming February' part shows several signs of being editted.
First Line support don't write those, they click 'someone is trying to sell cryptocurrencies again' and the text is supplied to them.
That means ALL of them would have accesss to this information and everyone getting a warning now would get this warning, not just the OP.
First Line Support gets told LAST, press releases come first, lots of staff would need told about the policy change before they started telling customers as they removed listings.
We wouldn't hear about it because one guy got a warning with a message of hope in it, that's the way someone faking the news would do it but not how the PR department would handle it.
First Line Support does not break news, this makes it so unlikely the bullshit alarm should burn out.
It is obviously fake because this isn't how they would handle something of this significance - the decision would have had to go through a bunch of people before FLS and a bunch of them would have told us before they told FLS.

@_date: 2014-11-06 13:31:14
Potentially, yes.
Although Bitcoin's code itself can't be changed by legislation the actions of companies definitely can - if the government made a blacklist law retailers would obey it - if your coins ended up on a list that prohibited Amazon from accepting them, your coins would be worth less than coins not on the prohibited list.
This is where we will be either temporarily saved by bankers who lobby for less legislation or fucked over by bankers who realise their coins are in the "higher value" stack and decide to throw the rest of us under the bus by sponsoring legislation to make their Bitcoin worth more.
Realistically, you have to ask yourself what you get out of risking it, especially with DarkWallet not being finished software.

I'm sorry for your loss but I have to stick with the Blockchain we have.
You backed the wrong horse and while that has to sting I can't support reversing the legitimate transactions that happened during the same time period to bail MtGox's customers out.
If the price of letting the all the other merchants who didn't screw up the last year keep their money is letting the people who chose to use MtGox lose theirs it is no contest.
The advice has always been: Don't put in more than you can afford to lose, don't use an exchange to store coins, beware your exchange isn't running a fractional reserve, etc. and people ignored it, thought they would be fine, thought Bitcoin was such a sure thing they didn't need to listen.
This was the reason why and now the next time the conversation comes up I don't have to have the argument I just have to link to this event.
If you lost money with MtGox, unfortunately it seems the only thing you will get in return is this lesson.
If you didn't have money with MtGox - I hope you learn from the people that did.

You need people to verify people, there's no perfectly decentralised full electronic solution. 
That's not a huge problem with voting.
The west needs to admit India does elections better 820 million eligible voters and a huge turn out.
You want to verify people's identities so that you can know people only voted once by checking a list.
I would say that it doesn't matter who people are as long as people only get one vote each.
Combine how the west arranges voting - you turn up, get a bit of paper - with how India prevents repeat voting (theirs is the most tried and tested system, it works) by dyeing their finger.
You just need to stop people voting more than once, you don't need to know who they are to do that.  
Have them turn up with their public keys to the place they turn up to vote now, the volunteers that are there now anyway now sign their public key (making it eligible in their election) and dyes a finger.
It can all be done in public so that it can be seen to be fair with the list of keys signed made public so the number of keys signed can be compared to the number of people eligible to vote.
The volunteers can sign keys with an address that is generated on a cheap device in public, broadcast, used in plain site and the device publicly wiped.
We don't need to track identities and arguably shouldn't, we can still act as human captchas for each other without needing to know background info.

There is no trust worthy test that beats having people say 'this is a person'.
The reason I want to decentralise voting is so everyone has an equal, verifiable vote not on politicians but on individual issues directly.
Once that key is verified they can vote directly on any law until the next round of verification.
It doesn't matter how I verify people are people. If I allow the current systems to handle that part now the rest can happen - if I insist on changing the lists I have to wait until I have a better list.
If I go with what we have now I can swap it out for technology as it becomes available - I don't need to make everything perfect at once, I just need each part to work as well or better than what there is now and start upgrading bit at a time.
The initial verification is a steep mountain, I'm not sure about the value of the reward, given it means no system until you have a technical solution.
It'll take a lot of time and even if it worked flawlessly may not be trusted.
Big changes meet big resistance.

Easy to build but not terribly secure in some configurations - leaving membership open would risk bots.
Invite by mods will be most secure but at the expense of being a community people would join.
Of all the other methods I like the idea of voting users in the most, it decentralises well - maybe give communities a nonmembers area people can 'knock' on the doors of to get in where they can introduce themselves and get voted in.
If you were building something for the purpose you wouldn't need to co-opt dust transactions because you could use something made specifically for that use.
@_date: 2014-01-19 18:49:26
Well, that's good, always hard to know where to start.
I'd start by stop using 'Adwords' - it gives the wrong impression, like calling it McAds or iAds...
First - private keys stay private, you don't give someone money by giving them a private key anymore than you pay your bills by sending your physical credit card and telling them to help themselves.
Second - as others have pointed out, direct on the blockchain transactions are not compatible with the current Bitcoin, you'd burn it out.
Otherwise there is the makings of a great idea here - cut the users in to stop them using ad block.
There are Bitcoin supported Ad Services but none that encourage the user not to get rid of the unsightly bullshit marketers think will make me buy their crap - and on the internet it is mostly crap - ' Women in 'Proxy' near you!', get (thin | rich | more hair | bigger penis | thinner | muscular).
The reason users opt not to see Ads is because they did once and it wasn't worth their time.
Sure, you could pay them and more will look at weight loss ads but that doesn't mean they'll buy that crap.
It takes more than showing keyword based ads to beat Google, there is so much wrong with internet marketing I think the guy that starts again has as a good chance of finishing before a hundred guys trying to fix what we have.
I don't think this is quite it but as you aren't working fulltime on it and are competing with billionaires who do I think this is along the right direction and I think it could trigger some good ideas.
Bitcoin makes moving money online trivial and accessible but you still have to move it the right way, to the right people, in the right amounts.
Target marketing is where users give up their personal information, I don't see why I need to tell anyone why I want the ads I want? Why can't I keep private bruising habits private and have my computer request the relevant ads? 
Of course, there's the whole security issue but you had that anyway.
What will kill Google is misplaced trust, I don't see people rebounding from that into the arms of more of the same - using Bitcoin and offering rewards to users doesn't tackle the reason people block ads.
Requiring a plugin doesn't help the cause.
It is hard to be too critical or serious when I know it is just an idea you are kicking around but the tl;dr would be that it is hit and miss.
I don't see there being any benefit to getting rid of Google, at least not the role it performs - it does so well and got so popular because site owners liked it because it pays out, isn't too ugly and is fairly strictly regulated by comparison to other advertising networks.
Replace that with a plugin and even if I lie about the odds and say users and companies advertised will be so happy they are having orgies in the street with no one paying the websites with the content it all slowly goes away.
A market place that brings websites and users and advertisers together will do better than one that cuts out the reason users are on the internet - content.
Keep everyone happy and you have a better chance and by getting websites on board you can get rid of requiring a plugin that if it ever gained traction websites would go out of their way to detect and block.

Because the price THIS SECOND should not be our focus - it teaches people new to Bitcoin that what matters isn't Bitcoin's utility, its revolutionary decentralised network, it's what it's worth right fucking now so you can sell them at a profit.
There's a reason a browser plugin that added a Dogecoin price ticker managed to steal so much coin - when you are hyper focused on the price all the time you let the simple shit slip you buy - like not installing software from random nobodies onto a machine that controls real money you can't get back once it is stolen.
The PRICE of Bitcoin shouldn't be focus - it should be improving Bitcoin. Making it better to use. Easier to obtain. Safer. Adding more places to spend it. Those are the things we should care about.
We don't need a price ticker so all those get rich quickers don't need to open another tab.

As well as it being possible for an authority to mark keys as authorised to participate in elections, it is also possible to use vote collection methods that:
* Allow each voter to know 100% that their vote was counted and was counted **correctly**
* Prevent any voter from proving how they voted to *any* third party, even the government, even though they themselves can be certain their vote is there
* Allow votes themselves to be encrypted, combined in their encrypted state and the *total* but **not** any individual vote is then decrypted - meaning the total is known but no single vote is
* Allow various levels of decentralisation

Check the other sources on the matter - Mt Gox is passing the blame because *their* code went wrong, Bitcoin isn't broken.
There are parts of transactions that can't be changed, the important part that handles security.
Mt Gox decided to use the part that can be changed - a choice they made, to store their transaction ID instead of tracking it internally with their own database.
If their tag got left off a payment you could contact support and when they couldn't find a payment with that ID in the blockchain they would assume you didn't get paid and *manually* pay you the same amount again.
Bitcoin did not do this, Gox staff did this and this is how they are handling the embarassment.

Because laws apply to the country people live in - if you think the majority of people are going to be trading blacklist Bitcoin for whitelist Bitcoin you've another thing coming; most people will just avoid blacklist Bitcoin full stop.
It'll be like when people were buying Mt Gox Bitcoin - it'll be a risky proposition attempted by a tiny number of people and one side will lose out.
A company will legally relocate to avoid taxes, they will not ignore a law in a country they operate in or avoid a country with shitty laws that potentially will give them a profit - the companies that matter will operate in the countries with shitty laws and they will follow the ones they can't avoid or lobby around.
They didn't incorporate in Ireland and stop trading in the USA or start breaking US laws - they did it because US law specifically allows them to do that to avoid tax. They aren't doing anything illegal and they will continue not to do anything illegal if asked to blacklist a given subset of Bitcoin.
They don't immigrate out; the change their legal HQ - the difference isn't a small one, when a person leaves a country they aren't there any longer, when a corporation moves to a tax haven they still operate in the country they "moved out" of.
Who wants Bitcoin that doesn't worth with Amazon, doesn't work with &lt;list of first world countries here&gt;? Far fewer people than who'd be happier just sticking to Bitcoin on the whitelist and never worrying about it.
That a few people will still trade tainted Bitcoin won't be a huge legislative problem, they aren't going to think their law failed because a tiny percentage of people ignore it(it certainly didn't convince them to give up on the war on drugs for decades), if anything, the majority of people following it will make it harder for those small number to stay anonymous if they live in a country where legally they cannot trade Bitcoin from the blacklist.
It'll get ever more difficult, time consuming and they'll be trading at bigger and bigger losses as time goes on.... or they could bypass that bullshit and install the whitelist themselves - what do you think sounds like most people?

"China can't blockade the internet, it'll flourish elsewhere and they'll have no choice but to be more accommodating". That'll be why the UK got its own firewall? Negative ideas can spread just as easily as positive ones and you have enough money, enough press and enough bullets you can put any cat back into the bag. THINK OF THE KIDS. Job done.
The average person dies less than 30 miles from where they are born.
The idea that people will move if the place gets shitty, especially in some particularly minor way like this(relatively speaking) is baseless crap. While the idea may exist elsewhere it can die out in places and given Bitcoin has the advantage of being global without the bullshit of banking that hurts the cause.
I'm sorry but if this experiment is to win out action is ABSOLUTELY required.
There are countless ways to derail Bitcoin - you can make it hard to spend - ID laws for money you hand over or make it too expensive too early so its mostly owned and controlled by a tiny few just like every other currency, hard to obtain - ID laws et all for money you receive.
They can leave the Bitcoin protocol running and cripple it so much in the execution that all the freedoms are lost. If you know where enough of the money is it becomes useless as an anonymous currency too.
Bitcoin stays worth money as long as more and more large companies keep accepting it; that can all go away with a few laws, a few regulations...
When you look at the entire landscape, when you acknowledge the NSA's evil, the technology they have and how it could be used combined with the other areas of the government and how little they've acted to curtail the NSA in any reasonable manner, this is not a won war - the other side has been building tanks while we've been making bunting. If you think everyone can wait it out you're going to be disappointed.
Hell, if I was the government's advisor on defeating Bitcoin, I'd hire people to spread the message the government is losing and the storm can be weathered without further effort. This could easily be dollar 2.0 with all of the disadvantages and then some.
Bitcoin can succeed as money and yet the revolution it promised could still fail - the value of Bitcoin is our biggest blackeye. We let greed take over.

If you would allow me the liberty of rephrasing your question I think I might be able to answer. How do you feel about:
    Could a decentralised system provide the
    same functionality as Netflix/Spotify without
    the need for a central authority to store,
    censor, bill or monitor the new network?
Going with that - I think that mostly centres around the functionality Netflix and Spotify provide, such as:
* Providing a catalogue of media users can browse and consume
* Collecting money from those users that is distributed between the content host and the owner of the rights to the content
* Allowing users to share recommendations
* Allowing users to review and rate content
I think it could do those, I think it would struggle with other things Netflix does - like, creating House of Cards.
I think it would even have the benefit of giving more money directly to smaller/newer artists and artists in general. I would be surprised if there aren't many attempts at this in the works.
I'm sure there are plenty would be anonymous documentary makers who would love to monetise their efforts that require a non-traditional media distribution channel.
The main problem there is - the current competitor to to that idea is creating a torrent of the movie/song/etc and collecting voluntary or web-based payment via Bitcoin and they do it already. I think people are pretty happy to make do for now, they aren't demanding a consolidated network for it.

Of course he did, but I made a joke because I'm not serious either.
"look good" to who?
I'll tell you what doesn't look good - when Mt Gox can quite possibly lose more Bitcoin than they can afford to pay their customers and then they try to run their company without admitting the fact to cover their asses instead of coming to us with their cap in hand and an apology like they should have.
I'll tell you what doesn't look good - when you have to blame someone else's code because you were surprised your code needed to account for a year old wiki entry that explicitly described and predicted the problem you would have.
I'll tell you what doesn't look good - when you use a mutable field that is sent plain text over a peer to peer network to store a unique ID your customer support NEEDS to verify payment was made after the documentation made clear it wasn't safe and has done for over a year.
In those circumstances, "fuck Mt Gox" exactly the correct statement, as decided by a majority vote of the users who bothered to vote here - to censor the naughty words looks far worse when the sentiment that fuels them is more than justifiable.

Bitcoin can steal most alt coin ideas - but since they stole Bitcoin's code to create the alt coin they've no grounds for complaint.
I'm not saying it is right or wrong, just that you have to admit it will happen and that changes the landscape with regards to how long alt coins have to live - you can't pretend that Dogecoin being worth next to nothing is a unique selling point because the Bitcoin crowd just started pushing "bits", that hurts its long term prospects.
Do you see Dogecoin evolving and continuing to innovate? I don't. I see it running out its usefulness and novelty factor eventually. It's based on a meme - a rage comic based alt coin would have taken off a few years ago but since rage comics fell out of favour it would have died by now. 
The Shibe Meme has a limited life span, after that what's left and how do you reconcile that with the horrible branding that no longer makes sense?

"It hasn't been done before so it will never happen" - well done on underestimating and nullifying every invention, ever.
By your statement, Bitcoin itself shouldn't exist.
Can you imagine how strange a world we would live in if Bitcoin, invented by a non-programmer who couldn't even finish the client code before disappearing, turned out to be better than any other attempts made until the end of time? How unlikely that is?
Bitcoin has being the original on its side, but just because I can't tell you what the next big cryptocurrency will offer doesn't mean there isn't a market waiting to be discovered and exploited, it just means I won't invent the solution.

Keep having fun and waiting till Bitcoin builds tech then Doge-fying it.
Dogecoin's biggest boon is the low value and the community spirit - it is *fun* - the last thing they need are sharp price increases because they'll lose the only real edge they have - they should concentrate on the positivity not the price.
As an alt coin what merits Dogecoin's existence amongst all the other alt coins is the community, bring a lot of speculators who'll get angry at everyone and stress at the price and you have another Bitcoin without the merits of Bitcoin.

 If you were transferring money you would do it with Bitcoin not a printed Bitcoin key stuck to a coin. The middle step doesn't add value.
Plus, people still can order coins, have them sent to someone and fund the coins themselves.
The government haven't really stopped any of the things they were complaining about yet are now happy - that should make you distrust their motives more.
What is a worry is that if the coins have a standard value backed in Bitcoin the whole thing becomes a bit more user friendly and it competes too directly with normal currency - eventually there wouldn't be so many that they were collector's items, they would be worth face value and people would spend them instead of hanging on to them. That's what the real worry was and why the government left them alone now they stopped standardising them.

The NSA's software specifically seperates out users who use privacy services like TOR and VPN's.
While in theory these services should make you more anonymous they actually just paint a bigger target on your back, especially since there are successful unmasking attacks historically.
I think mixing will do the same - if you have a bunch of users and some are trying to hide their activities and some aren't, you are going to be more suspicious of the users who do and put more time into finding out what they were really up to.
There are exactly 0 mixers you can trust not to be honey pots or can trust not to leak or save more data on you than they advertise.

If they can't write a client you don't want them building an exchange.
The standard client is made for the standard user - exchanges have exceptional needs; more concurrent users, much better account/wallet separation, attack detection, etc.
They should be building their own clients - Bitcoin has an exceptionally elegant protocol compared to some banks, it is much easier to work with and the test environment is great - no registration, no passwords - you just connect to the testnet.
You bet they will now be much better tested now.

Being able to see an address has funds shouldn't make those funds anymore at risk of being stolen because that information is already public.
You can view the balance of an address you don't own so your site and the blockchain.info account you use for the site should be a seperate account from the one that actually has accesss to spend funds.
Create one account for managing money.
Create another for the API. Use ONLY the address and never the private key with this account. If it gets compromised they won't have accesss to any money in the other account.

Given those are not the demographics of the planet in general I don't see what it matters how Bitcoin is distributed today; unless you don't expect those demographics to change in which case Bitcoin never sees mass adoption.

Check my post history - that's a reddit visualisation site particularly good for this. It'll show I don't post in Dogecoin, don't have them and don't promote them.
That said - Bitcoin is serious money and serious business with serious work going into it, the reason we aren't as cheerful is because we are no longer just hobbyists.
If you are here long term it is the only game that matters, that's why I said anything any alt coin did right would be absorbed by Bitcoin (and after the alt coin took all the risk to prove it worked I might add now) but short term there are still people who want to enjoy themselves and they aren't going to just vanish because Bitcoiners get grumpy.
Dogecoin will be around for a good while because there is a demand for it - all it takes is for people to tell themselves there's a difference between it and Bitcoin and the perceived difference will attract a number of people greater than zero and that's all that needs to happen.
It's only bullshit if Dogecoin is imaginary - as long as people want it to have value it will continue to do so.

The emotive argument won't get us anywhere and comparing a whole currency to a decentralised eBay clone is asinine - I don't need to tell Satoshi, he stopped with the currency too.
Decentralising a currency was a big thing, that has far reaching implications for the entire online payment industry. Before Bitcoin there was no way to send money remotely without going through an authority.
That's big.
Decentralising a website is for a lot of the users moot, they sign up, they use site, they buy stuff, stuff arrives, they don't care about the politics of shops.
Decentralising a currency changed the game, a decentralised eBay clone done right should keep most of the implementation details out of the faces of users - a few years down the line and half won't even know it is decentralised because they won't care to ask which means the majority of people using such a time wouldn't know about the only USP you have - that doesn't make it particularly important or pivotal.
Sure, for some people it matters but I think you should re-count them - just because that group of people posts a lot in doesn't mean they are sufficient in number to run what will be a shitty eBay clone that's not as good but people will use because it is decentralised without any other selling points.
I don't want to buy anything illegal and I have zero motivation to forgo the buyer protections I get from centralised stores that I can go back to and yell at. It's cool but it just isn't a revolution by itself.
Whether the years will impart enough improvements for a decentralised market to overtake eBay or not isn't important at this point in time - in the years it will take to happen there is no guarantee the first decentralised market will be the one that makes it big. The first to do it may not offer enough other things; the second mouse could easily be the one eating this cheese.
The mouse trap here is believing one feature elevates you beyond a company worth hundreds of millions when the fact is that even if that company is hated by a huge number of people, that one feature is just one feature.

I don't think people are "anti white", I think that's just the last defence racist people have now that times have changed and you can't just be openly racist and they are gaining support from moderates who think compromise is agreeing with everyone a little.

Only if you assume being the highest bidder comes with extra merit than merely having the most money, it doesn't.
Google doesn't just sell our eyeballs, they exercise editorial control over who they are sold too and compared with every other advertising company out there now that I see regularly online they don't even compete, they leave a hungry competition to fight over scraps.
Screw the highest bidder first approach by itself, the profit margins for scams are high because if you don't deliver you don't have costs and since Bitcoin can be stolen remotely people will discover zero days and stick up ads to the malware infested crapnet.
It isn't about how loud they are, it is about trust.
A company that has costs because it actually ships products will not be able to outbid one that merely steals things over the internet and never has to provide the customer with a product.
Google is one of the few super large companies who's fans like what they do, you have to better them.


No, you did good and I like the idea on the whole it just isn't finished yet and as an unfinished idea it still needs refinement.
It isn't your fault, it isn't your full time job - your IDEA competes with existing ideas whether you mean to follow it up or not and those other ideas have seen billions of dollars flow through them - you are just sharing a passing idea that you don't plan on working on.
It isn't a surprise that your idea isn't quite ready to out compete them yet, *no* idea would be at this stage. 
It has the potential to be, but it just isn't yet.
That doesn't mean it is a bad idea - I'm sure AdWords wasn't up to much after only a few hours of work either but as the idea isn't there yet and as it isn't actively being worked on further I can hardly declare it a Google killer.

It isn't an unselfish act when is trying to up adoption by giving insignificant amounts(as they cannot be spent on anything, they have no practical use) away in an attempt to increase the price so much that the value of their remaining Bitcoin goes up by more than they gave away in tips.
It is a half baked investment scheme that aims to generate a profit the tippers, not an act of kindness.
Or are we pretending that the upswing in price that comes with adoption isn't why we are trying to get more people involved now?

Lack of representation is the negative - it isn't the number of white guys or the number of people who aren't white, it is the number of people who have no one speaking for them.
Diversity for diversity's sake was always a losing idea, "positive discrimination" is a joke - but representation should be something everyone wants and something people shouldn't have to defend wanting, because it should be so obvious why it is needed.
How can we be a global currency when we have such a narrow band of people in positions of power?

OP is right about how people could have used the bug.
If Gox stopped withdrawls to cash out themselves elsewhere, they could then drop this announcement to crash the price and buy in at a lower price, recovering some of the lost BTC.
I'm not saying they did but it is amongst the things that are possible and it would have been amongst their better moves at this point because this could be the potential death of MtGox, what is left to play for could just be how deep the people in charge get buried when people attempt legal action and the government considers fraud and negligence charges.
Unlike banks, Gox is not too big to fail or make an example of - if I was a lobbyist for a bank this would be the pressure point I would be applying my leverage to.
Even if the banks secretly favour Bitcoin this is in their interests because they'll be able to capitalise on the lower price.
This won't end Bitcoin - I know that because my faith in it hasn't been shaken and you are never the only person who's thought something on the internet - but the price could still go down further if panic spreads and people start throwing their weight around.
We live in interesting times.

If we jump all over every company without our own due diligence because of our own greed we are no better.
Just because there is Bitcoin stock code doesn't mean every company needs share holders and dividends.
Most of the companies that do know enough about shares and Bitcoin to be dangerous - literally enough to *want* it and to feel the cool factor. It wasn't a reasoned decision.
A lot of the people buying shares know even less about investing but it is soooooo accessible now how can they not?

I don't disagree - that's what I described it as marketing - however, there are varying levels of dishonesty in marketing and how much your actions constitute a deliberate, conscious deception matter.
Some marketing is trying to find the right people for the product, some marketing is trying to sell the wrong people on the product.
This is the latter.
Bitcoin has the potential to be a currency that is widely used and safe... or one only suitable for a small number of technically minded people and everywhere in between.

Loss of physical control is loss of security period.
If someone gives you their USB stick then I can NEVER know the private keys weren't compromised the same way I can generate my own address offline and know I'm golden.
You can't prove or guarantee it wasn't hacked, rooted or otherwise compromised and I wouldn't know until my dumb ass lost money to a thief.
Besides, without the network you can't know the Bitcoin on the usb key haven't been spent and if you have access to the network you should use it, given it is several orders of magnitude more secure than a finger print scanner you would have to be crazy not to.
Your USB stick makes Bitcoin worse by removing the peer to peer network that secures it.
Finger prints aren't secure, you leave copies of them almost everywhere you go and worse case muggers force you to press it.

MtGox verified it paid customers by writing their own internal ID's on the Bitcoin transaction.
Unfortunately that ID can be taken off the transaction before it is included in a block and rebroadcast without it.
That means they get the money but MtGox's tag gets left off.
Then they email MtGox and say there's money missing.
MtGox looks for a payment with the ID, when the customer support couldn't find it they assumed the payment didn't go through and sent more money.
This allowed people to get MtGox to send out more than they had.
I haven't used MtGox - can you sign up without providing ID? If so, this is very bad for them.

Especially since it gives us access to a class of devices that can't afford the 13GB the blockchain currently needs.
My PC uses 500 watts of power, a RPI uses 4 watts and costs $50 - to protect the value of the Bitcoin I currently own I would more than happily deploy a RPI to hold up the network and I'm sure other people would too but if I need to use a PC I'm not going to bother - my Bitcoin would decrease in value at a slower rate than my PC would need repaired and chew up power.
I'm financially better off now.

That might have lead to interest in transaction malleability and the DDOS attacks but they are distinct events and not the same thing at all and each one requires its own solution.

Their salaries depend on misrepresenting it and not promoting it by saying anything positive until they are in a better position to profit and control from Bitcoin, not in being ignorant of how Bitcoin works.
Them saying something positive would make the price go up; it is their ace in the hole - they won't be deploying it until they own Bitcoin. When they do, they'll personally profit just from saying good things about Bitcoin. They won't waste that before they've skin in the game.
They have people on staff who are there just to explain stuff like this to those in positions of importance.
Once they've prepared an actual plan, put in place their technological solutions, prepared notes for investors and other stakeholders, prepared a sales pitch to customers and got the technology in place so customers can buy in through them, oh and sorted through all the legal crap, they will be able to buy in, pump the price and get out.
Just look at how many more people now trade Bitcoin and do so by involving their bank at one point in the process, look how many people were having transactions blocked and accounts closed a few years ago compared to now. 
Look how many more companies that deal with Bitcoin have got banks on board for the fiat part of transactions.
Banks are more informed on Bitcoin now than they ever were and they are only going to learn more as we go on. It doesn't do the community well to ignore bankers and their influence, to right them off as idiots.

Bitcoin is safe because it cannot EVER be TAKEN (funds in traditional banking can be taken by banks, governments...).
However, the mechanism that allows Bitcoin to be given - private keys - enables people who are bad with technology to inadvertently give away access to funds.
Bitcoin is perfectly safe, it is people that are unsafe.


Your phone's insurance company can't shut down your phone like your bank can shut down your account. Your bank account isn't safe, if a dispute between you and the bank or the government were to happen you would be fighting to get your money back, not fighting to keep it.
If a dispute over your Bitcoin arose between you and the government, if you had done your part correctly, you would have your Bitcoin until you gave it up. With money it can be taken by someone else.

Mining is where currency is created, that screws with your maths (and you are ignoring investment and running costs) and what you are saying.
You can't just count the transactions and divide by the Bitcoin the miners received and say they were paid for the transactions and that is the cost per transaction. 
They are supposed to have extra incentive over the fees because given the number of transactions if the reward was only a reasonable amount per transaction the network wouldn't be secure enough to use.

The part that I disagreed with was this part:


The NSA, unfortunately for people like you and me, hire some of the most brilliant mathematicians and programmers the world has to offer - they aren't puting out work that would get discovered very quickly.
If it was true that their work was this sub par then the what if is simple:
Every tax paying American should stop whatever they are doing right now and demand a refund for the money they've been shelling out to the NSA, they should de-fund and eliminate it completely and immediately because it is utterly useless.
Of course, it isn't, the NSA may not be 100% composed of brilliance and I consider the organisation to be completely immoral but they certainly captured enough of the talent to put to rest the idea that they would be this incompetent.
The idea that they can't have done anything because we would have noticed by now is laughable. They have all the funds of one of the richest nations in the world to play with, all the talent that gives them access to and the benefit of not being answerable to anyone in reality.
Anyone wishing to have their minds blown shouldn't be looking at Area 51 at all, they should be trying to work their way up the NSA ladder.

The desire to coin-ify everything is understandable but when I weigh the pros and cons, look at what it would take to create, I'm not sold.
There's nothing inherently wrong about a cryptocurrency backed peer to peer media distribution network but the part of you that doesn't have developer experience is letting you down when you say you want to put the media in the coins themselves.
There is no real value in that - it doesn't add anything for miners, consumers or people hosting the files.
This is a great idea from your point of view but puting things 'in' coins doesn't add anything for anyone else. It just sounds kinda cool. In practice it makes everything a little bit worse for everyone.

Saying that the software is theoretically secure is no good.
PGP/GPG has been available for years; all the email hacks, all the government eavesdropping, all of it could have been completely avoided. We've had the technological means to protect ourselves for over a decade.
Yet no one does - the problem with Bitcoin is while there are ways to secure yourself the majority of people are not going to use Bitcoin that way. If you give them options a big portion of users will choose the wrong ones. 
Bitcoin is theoretically secure yet millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin has been stolen anyway.
The education isn't there yet, the hardware isn't there yet, the software isn't there yet - this is time to work on those things, not trick the technically inept into buying in by moving the decimal place over, changing what we call things and saying "see how much more you get for your money now".

The secure way is to transfer ownership, giving someone a copy of your wallet is merely sharing ownership.
The original owner doesn't need to give up control and by the time you realise this you will have zero of the funds left.

It was for comedic effect - I promise my volume never went above "lazy nerd who can't be bothered to yell".


That's a silly question - it's an either/or affair - either you save Gox from liquidation and run it in the hopes of making the money back or you liquidate and take what you can get - after liquidation there won't be anything to make an attempt at being a company with. If they strip Gox there'll be nothing to run - not that it matters, what there is now is code written by Mark Kerples that can't be trusted or re-used AT ALL in any future endeavours.
There's nothing worth keeping even if the company wasn't liquidated. I think if you put everything Gox has in a blender and drank it the nutritional value of the paper would be higher than the monetary value of Mt Gox. That's the closest people will come to "getting their money's worth".
Surely people don't think they'll get to eat their cake and keep it?
They are barely getting acknowledgement from Kerples that cake ever existed; the cake is a lie.
I'm glad the side action is keeping people from going postal, as inept as he is people volunteered their money to Kerples - theft should't result in death; but they can't really expect to see *money* back at this stage. From the look of the OP it is just another legal firm trying to bring in more wealth on the backs of misfortune.

He just said "if it goes into liquidation its zero"(NONE of that extra stuff) but the truth is the value of liquidating may be greater than the value of owning the "company" that emerges out of the festering corpse of Gox - I don't disagree they get to own 0% if the company gets liquidated, but they will get more actual money and actual Bitcoin back.


I did NOT say that - I said that they would get more than  0% because they would get the liquidated assets(even if only at pennies to the dollar), not that they would get to own more of the company.
I did not say if Gox was liquidated they wouldn't get 0% ownership, I just wanted to make it clear they would get more than 0 period.
You pushed 0% as a low figure - but since ownership of whatever comes out of this is only half the battle, it may be the more profitable option. That's why I replied.
I feel sorry for the people who got Gox'd, they are about to get Weekend at Berney'd by some lawyers making the corpse of Gox "wave" at them and sign cheques that'll do nothing but bounce.
Giving Mt Gox is poison, you should consider owning it negative money; it's almost a step down from 0.

With the internet you only need to SEE something to get value, with Bitcoin you need to SPEND it. You still don't get it. They can fuck with your ability to spend it by passing laws companies have to follow - they don't have to fight the technology head on at all, EVER, by comparison to tackle piracy they have to cut the supply lines (because seeing is consuming) and that is a lot harder because you can't trace anything or cut things off without effort. By comparison, they already know where Reddit is, where Gift is, where CheapAir is - if they want to enforce laws it isn't going to be like fishing in a huge ocean like policing the internet, it is going to be like buying a fish from a pet shop.

You realise I mentioned dye NOT as a suggestion? 
I said it next to 'tick names off a list' because while some places have lists and a person ticking off names other countries use dye that wears off after a few days.
Right now.
I wasn't suggesting your country use dye, I was saying my model supports countries that already do so they don't have to change how they handle elections.
This isn't a change I'm proposing, this already happens! 
You aren't following - you don't VOTE in person, just verify you ARE a person. Once every four years it would be here, same span as elections already requiring physical attendance.
After the once every x years key signing event you can participate in the decentralised network as a citizen of  that country.
Verification has to be done in the physical because we do it that way now - my idea keeps a lot more things the same, that's why even if your idea is better mine would happen first.
Everything is decentralised and online but the only reliable way to verify a person is a person is using people.
So once every election cycle everyone gets new keys, come together to verify them and can vote from home.
In person voter verification happens now so if we are racing, I win!

It was tailored to a *very* specific version of firefox(actually the firefox that comes with Tor Bundle which is why I believe Javascript is disabled by default now) but I forget the OS.


The JS code itself was next level - if I remember correctly, buffer overflow that caused a specific section of memory to be manipulated resulting in firefox connecting to a specific honey pot server whilst bypassing the TOR settings, revealing a user's true location. It also "tagged" each user so the honey pot knew which users they were tracking already.
It came immediately before the shutdown of various child pornography sites and was more likely related to that than because it occurred after DPR's arrest.

There are variations - but taking a sample of 7 blocks out of 282034  dented your credibility.
There are variations on normal banking too and I see you didn't comment on them and you seem to believe that speeding up confirmations would help which as the root poster said - makes you misinformed, I'm here to help you understand and compare with the banking system you should already be familiar with, not argue.
If confirmations happened quicker it would be because blocks took less processing power to mine, which would mean they were less secure, which would mean merchants would require more confirmations to accept transactions, meaning your wait time would be roughly similar.
It might be frustrating having to wait an *HOUR* this one time, but the same thing can happen with regular banking and god forbid you have to wait for a replacement card.
I want you to take away three things:
* Speeding up the confirmation time wouldn't help you.
* Blocks are generally less than every 10 minutes, that is why we are further ahead with mining all the Bitcoin than was originally predicted, variation aside, it is on average less than 10 minutes
* Traditional banking has lots of issues that causes you to wait just as long or longer.
If you need to be able to turn around and exchange on a dime, you should have kept your money with the exchange and not tried to shovel it in at the last second.
It is not Bitcoin's problem you waited until the instant you wanted to trade before moving your Bitcoin to the exchange - if you wanted to be able to exchange instantly, you need money on the exchange.
That's true of traditional banking too.

I'm not sure encouraging solo mining and increasing the price are positives.
I think the price has outstripped our infrastructure and places to spend Bitcoin, I think mining pools keep the difficulty high.
I'm not sure making the formula for checking valid blocks more complicated will make things better.
I don't want to "encourage dedication to the coin" either - I want people using Bitcoin because they continually choose to of their own free will, not because they have been incentivize - all that means is that they are waiting for an alt coin with a better reward to ditch you.
If users are punished for having x% of the hash power, they will pose as 2 users, or 3 or 4 or 5, whatever it takes to maximise their gains. You couldn't stop them. They would cut through any measures you put in place like a blowtorch through butter - there's money in it. They will cheat.

Side stepping how? ALL the companies I can think of that accept Bitcoin and operate from the USA or the UK that aren't actively being pursued by law enforcement operate within the law and they would do so if the law changed.
Name some names - exactly who is sidestepping exactly what? I realise Bitcoin gives the feeling that we are operating outside of the normal financial system but is there any evidence that we are? Or is there evidence we pay lots of banking fees to send fiat to exchanges that comply with the same KYC laws as everyone else and then send the Bitcoin to companies that immediately exchange it back to fiat?
There will be NO BITCOIN LAWS. There will be CRYPTO CURRENCY LAWS. They will cover alt coins.
Alt coins won't take off like Bitcoin after the laws come into affect because unlike with Bitcoin where companies were able to accept it legally, it won't be true of your alt coins, those laws will cover alt coins not made yet the same way drug analogue laws cover drugs not invented.
How can you grow alt coins with no exchanges and no companies accepting it for payment? You can't.
"There" opinion isn't an opinion - it will be legally binding and they will enforce it with force.
They haven't lost their grip, they are just yet to squeeze. It is a complicated game of many moving parts and you've dismissed their actions as useless when they will amount to something when it all comes together.
They can regulate Bitcoin. They don't need to change the code or fuck with the blockchain or the client.
They only need to make laws regarding the acceptance and trade of Bitcoin and apply it to COMPANIES. Why? Because once you do that you can take the spending power away from people with Bitcoin that didn't go through system X or process Y or comply with procedure Z - you can make it illegal for companies to accept Bitcoin the government doesn't want companies to accept.
They'll give good reasons - terrorism money, drug money, child porn money. People will be okay with it.
 If I say "All Bitcoin your company receives have to have come through an exchange with X license" we are done here. You might hate it but the companies wont.

That's the entire point though, it is only how you see it not how things are.
As more people have BTC it will be easier to exchange with individuals in person.
You can't just look at the direction things have taken and assume they will continue on that path - things change.
Exchanges are needed to interface with the current banking system because the current banking system has a fraud problem and there aren't enough people with Bitcoin for in-person exchanges.
Bitcoin's future isn't just going to be a higher price and more users, it is going to incite and fund a whole wave of innovation. As someone who develops, amongst other things, interfaces to traditional banking I can tell you that Bitcoin is going to give a whole new class of people to set up online and get paid online.
Amongst the things that will change will be exchanges.
Exchanges don't have veto power over transactions, they can't like Visa did refuse donations to Wikileaks, that is the centralisation Bitcoin was aimed at and it is doing that job excellently.
I'm not worried, I'm excited.

In the UK where I live you aren't anonymous, they just haven't finished the data mining processes. Just because they haven't combined people data with blockchain data doesn't mean they won't and can't.
The NSA monitors all traffic, you bet they've linked thousands of transactions to real identities by catching the transaction origin.
That's only the tip of the shitburg.
Bitcoin is not anonymous, we just have not had a chance to see the cards the other team has.
The thing about Bitcoin is the transactions don't go away, there's no pressing need to trace people right now, the government isn't in a hurry.
Combined with the tax and KYC stuff the government has plenty of people identified, eventually they'll hit them up for tax - my guess is they are waiting for a percentage of moon pie.

That is an okay analogy but it falls short and while your complaint is right about the analogy, it doesn't fit with Mt Gox because Mt Gox didn't use an existing product like Target using Linux in that example; they built their own version of it.

Completely wrong, the end part of all addresses are a checksum that validates the first part(just like the last digit of your credit and debit card allows offline validation of the well formed ness of the card number) which means there is a limited, specific set of valid addresses and it is very hard to make a valid address by making a few typos on another address

If people won't buy into Bitcoin because they feel buying a whole Bitcoin is too expensive and buying a fraction of a Bitcoin is pointless and someone suggests if we rename the units we can get more people who aren't smart and don't understand fractions to buy Bitcoin at an inflated price(because they'll mentally view these new units as being worth more even though they aren't)which will drive up the price, what do you call that?
It is using language and maths to convince people you've decided aren't very smart to buy something they wouldn't have otherwise.
If that isn't suckering them in, I don't know what would be.
It is an attempt to inflate the price by using a mental trick to convince people to buy.
Just another transparent ploy by the "get everyone into Bitcoin quickly, I need a price spike" camp.
They don't care whether or not these people should buy into Bitcoin, whether someone who doesn't understand fractions will be able to secure Bitcoin or use it properly.
Sure, they are leveraging the people who genuinely think fast adoption now is essential for Bitcoin's survival but that doesn't mean they are right or that they have everyone's best interests at heart.
Adoption goes up artificially, price goes up artificially - a chance to sell that will be followed by a drop with which to buy in at - that's the goal.
Not adoption that will drive up use, adoption that will temporarily drive up the price until people realise their "bits" aren't worth a whole cent each and lose faith.

The nodes not the miners should control the network because there are faaaaaaaaaaaar more nodes than miners. It wouldn't be any sort of consensus if you let miners, who get paid to do their job already and paid a predetermined amount so they could weigh the costs and benefits before committing so they've no right to complain it isn't what it should be and therefore no case to change it, decide how the network changes, they are not even the 1%.
It isn't broken - it stops the miners, who have an assigned and agreed upon purpose and are by far a minority - changing things to their advantage, like voting amongst themselves to increase the reward.
Things are as they should be, the reward for miners was decided upon before mining even started and the miners shouldn't be able to devalue my Bitcoin by voting to create Bitcoin that shouldn't exist; the OP's idea isn't workable.

Since the first failure there are bots that automatically detect the bug, calculate the private keys and sweep the address the instant the second transaction becomes visible on the network - at least one of the bots is run by a redditor who has returned funds to plenty of people already, it isn't all theoretical... The others are black holes. If they get it you won't see it again.
With a good crypto library you should be safe... But mistakes have been made in the past.

Bankers are not burying their heads in the sand, they just don't want to sell out their own product by plugging ours publicly.
Privately, they are informed and will be on the bandwagon and because they have plenty fiat wealth to buy in with, they will benefit from the upswings in prices to come.
The hard truth is that Bitcoiners are burying their heads in the sand.
Bitcoin will make bankers RICHER.
Before Bitcoin came along I bet half of never even had to pay ridiculous fees to send money abroad to strange, self labelled, self regulated "exchanges" - where do you think those fees go? To bankers.
As more people buy Bitcoin bankers get richer.
They can also use their software to monitor the transactions to and from their customers to/from exchanges and they can spot trends and they can put their automated trading software onto that.
When huge numbers of people are trying to buy in and waiting for their money to clear, banks will know, banks will buy in while their customer's accounts are still in transit and they will take advantage of their infrastructure to make a profit.
Bankers have a huge leg up. They have money to play with, they have talented programmers on staff that are used to finding exploits and loopholes in financial systems.
The stock market and high frequency trading made distance to the exchange a significant factor in wealth creation.
The thing about stocks is that normal people don't buy them in volume with the same frequency as people will hopefully be trading Bitcoin; that means that bankers will have a lot more data on their customers' buying and selling habits and they will data mine a profit from that information.
Sure, just now all they use that for is to cancel "high risk" transactions, but once they've trained the software properly they will be able to turn a profit from knowing information the rest of us doesn't have access to. 
Bankers aren't burying their heads in their sand - they are waging war and understand the value of the element of surprise. When Bitcoin is about to explode they want to be in there themselves, they don't want people who give them money to invest to start puting their own money into Bitcoin instead of leaving it with bankers. They can't publicly plug Bitcoin yet, but once they are holding significant amounts they will change what they say, make it easy to get Bitcoin from them and they will offer that as a service to their customers to make sure they always have a finger in the pie.

The Blockchain is a distributed ledger that lists transactions in order that can be verified by any third party - just now, all Bitcoin does with it is watch money getting moved around. That's important and the incentive the creation of Bitcoin provides is important to keeping the whole thing working but that doesn't mean we couldn't do far more with a distributed ledger than we are.
I would rather it was done separately from Bitcoin to reduce bloat and reduce the number of systems that can fail at a time and that would need to be banned, blocked and firewalled separately.
I think that's where the Alt Coins with long term sticking power will come from - Blockchain based systems that produce cryptocurrency as a side effect not a goal, where the main goals are rewarding collaboration and contribution to a network easier when no one is in charge, to prevent systems where one person is arbitration in charge and to use it you have to trust that person.
Yes, there are things like Primecoin but those came at a time where creating an alt coin so you could get in early on the ground floor and make money from being an early adopter was the goal and they tacked something interesting onto Bitcoin so they would stand out from the other Alt Coins.
I'm not talking about Alt Coins that happen to use something potentially useful in the Proof Of Work or other solutions looking for a problem or that are trying to avoid the "why waste so much energy" question by having something they can point to.
The Blockchain contains the fundamental parts of a peer to peer transactional database where we don't need a secure host to hold onto login credentials or keep records everyone else doesn't have access to. We can use cryptography - keys and signatures - to do everything out in the open and still not fear tampering or misuse of the data or data being stolen or sold.
There is lots of potential we haven't begun to touch; the Blockchain does have potential on its own.

It is still far too many transactions. Micro transactions keep it off the blockchain until the money is claimed.
Until it hits the blockchain, it isn't really yours anyway at which point it takes up as much room as any other transaction. Your link refers to this as "finalizing" the transaction.
Microtransactions prevent a single person from spamming the blockchain with lots of small amounts - if hundreds of thousands of people used it, it would still be too much.
Your idea competes with them whether you pursue it or not, as you don't have the time to dedicate to it you aren't "winning", since you aren't in anyway invested in it I'm sure that doesn't come as a huge blow but it is true.
The microtransactions don't really add value to anyone here and they still spam the blockchain more than is necessary because there is no point retrieving money the instant you can because it isn't worth spending.
There is no point claiming $0.10 of Bitcoin by itself.
Have it maintain a balance, make people withdraw when they want to - as they will do this far less often than automated withdrawals would occur it'll decrease the load because most people won't waste time claiming insubstantial amounts.
I understand completely that you aren't working on it and that is why I have had to judge it in its current form - unfinished.
I'm a developer too, with paid work and personal projects I think my calendar is going to be full for a long time so I can't work on new things either but like you I like to drop my 2 cents in the well and see if anyone else can make progress with it.

Definitely at least a few developers have had Bitcoin stolen; I don't see being "smart as me" as a shield against theft.
However, there are definitely more people who have made basic mistakes who have lost Bitcoin - it frustrates me, it does not make me feel better about myself that I'm "better" than them, because Bitcoin needs to work for everyone and it does not.
It is simply too much control given to people who have no interest in learning how it works and while not everyone who has had Bitcoin stolen was stupid, stupid people are struggling really hard to hold on to their money!
The problem is when you let everyone be their own bank there are a lot of people who get greedy and want in but who make shitty bank managers and won't take advice from anyone until they've lost it all.
There are no chargebacks, no do overs, nothing - your money gets sent somewhere and it is gone, forever... There is no authority, no company you can turn to and even if there was - eventually someone on the inside would steal all the money and send it on anonymously.
Some people aren't able to do it for themselves and that means they aren't qualified to vet people who offer to do it for them. It means there is no option that makes Bitcoin work for them in its current incarnation.
People are going to lose money because they aren't technically capable of securing it - the Bitcoin community needs to accept this. It seems the OP's whole plan is just to feel sorry for them, not to fix anything, not to work on security or accessibility - but to say that they aren't to blame, even though they were 100% in control of their money when they lost it.
You can't decentralise currency, take all that power and responsibility personally and then blame someone else when shit hits the fan.

Sure, but not in a likely manner, it ignores so much detail.
For Bitcoin to be a point of vulnerability for a specific country to where an attack from another nation would serve a purpose would require massive changes from today.
Firstly in adoption, since it is unlikely to become that important in one place and for that value not to hold in another it is safe to assume it will still be global. That means an attack on Bitcoin would be an attack on all countries that use it. 
It is less crazy to send in ground troops with forks than to attack Bitcoin to harm a specific government.

It is emotive because you said "ask Satoshi" like invoking the name by itself was some sort of argument or spell.
No, I said that not ENOUGH people are asking for it to be the sole USP of a site looking to slay the existing Goliaths. That's not nearly saying nobody is asking for it.
There are lots of potential advantages over eBay, but if I had a dollar for every ounce of wasted potential, well, it wouldn't be wasted.
Satoshi made something new, saying "let's do that thing Satoshi did, but with auctions" is not on the same level as creating a decentralised currency for the very first time.
You will be the Namecoin of the auction world - too late with a few good points that while technically good aren't real world good.

What the guy right here who knows a handful of programming languages is doing isn't rocket science either, but I don't think you want to take over from me right now either.
It isn't about you judging how hard someone else's job is, it is about having them communicate the very little things that can make or break the process for them. That means respecting their experience doing the job, not deciding their job isn't that hard and you could do it.
Even if I was sure you could do it - you haven't - knowing the theory and having practical experience are miles apart.
I don't need you to teach me the theory there and you have no experience to share; that is why I would find someone who does and can.
All the "not rocket science" stuff I did without you here, all the stuff that a casual observe could know or infer has been supplied by me already so there's nothing left for you to do there. All the stuff about his job that you could guess having never done his job I guessed for you.

Catches up - meaning I believe they will.
The world doesn't stop working on new technology until the whole world understands it, that isn't elitism, that's just reality.
You can keep up with developments or you can be an octogenarian with a VCR you can't program, it doesn't matter what the world does to make learning easier - people still have to want to learn - and the rest of the world still continues forward once you've decided you know enough or don't care about the latest version of the iPhone because you can use the one you have.
The bullshit thing you "quoted" me was neither of those, it was this:


That's bullshit, I never said that. I never intended anything I said to be understood to mean that.
What I did say was:


I didn't say they need to work harder, if anything I said if we were teaching them improperly WE need to work harder.
I only said they needed to WANT to learn; I never said that there was people who "didn't want it enough" or wanted it but "weren't trying".
All I put on them was the desire to learn, the DESIRE, not the aptitude. Everything else I left to the rest of us - if there are people who want to know and don't, I think it is because they aren't being taught properly not because they aren't learning properly.
You've maligned me for no good reason and it detracts from the places where you said something meaningful because wilful deception (it isn't accidental you are quoting me in ways that make it appear I'm saying something I haven't said - despite me being an asshole who must have left lots of good quotes you could have left instead) takes away from your other content because I have to reconsider it a few extra times because I already feel your dishonesty is the deciding factor in the things you say - it is certainly the part of the conversation you replied to.

Anyone with that address could disappear the money and you couldn't tell which one, horrible idea.
ANY wallet could be used by someone with the private key, it doesn't need coinbase to be 'online'. You could all use different wallets for all it matters.
You probably want to look at m-of-m transactions.
Sharing private keys or a coinbase account would be like giving dozens of employees the same expenses account with no way to differentiate between them. They could buy anything and deny it risk free and you wouldn't know who did it.
M-of-n transactions mean each people gets their own key and you can require 2 or more DIFFERENT people to approve transactions.

Whenever I suggest everyone should be treated equally with regards to getting a vote on issues I get a reply from someone warning me about stupid people.
I always do the same thing - I ask you think about how you came to be scared of 'stupid people'.
I think that's the greatest piece of propaganda ever because no one takes credit for it, it keeps multiple countries under *separate* governments and it is pervasive on every side - rich/poor, left/right, athiests/theists - a huge number of people on all sides of everything believe it and it goes without question.
More importantly - no one can trace it back, *everyone just knows that groups of people turn into stupid mobs*, right? 
Sure, there are mobs, there are stupid people but collectively I don't think we should be scared of each other.
We should be scared of whoever keeps the fear alive in us. 
Don't be convinced to give up your piece of equality because you are worried about being outnumbered by stupid people - we outnumber the people in charge and that's not doing us any favours - you should focus on getting a meaningful say in how things are run for yourself instead of worrying about what other people will do with theirs.

You don't?! The value is that you can transition to the new government without violent revolution.
You create laws from the start but knowing that if you voted to legalise murder that wouldn't save you from jail.
You need a transitional period to get all the old laws off the books and to reach critical mass where the new government has enough support to shut down the old government, otherwise you are just another oppressive minority that will have to beat its people down.
It draws people in because they will see what other people are voting for and they will want to be counted.
Everyone gets to see the government they would be getting BEFORE they got it so all the people saying groups make bad decisions would have to practically defend that accusation if all the voting produces moderate laws.
People will see actual laws before the government changes.
Unlike all the past revolutions where the new boss didn't keep promises this will produce BEFORE it gets practical power and we'll get to see it in action before it does damage.
That means people will use it like petitions before the current government is replaced which will attract attention and the big issues will be publicised through social media.
Some of the people voting won't have read all the background information on the network itself to begin with, they'll just want to vote when people on Facebook start trying to get their friends to help them sway issues - with all sides of all issues doing that we could collectively organise very quickly.
I see us doing great things collectively.
I think the majority of people are good and mean well and given a chance to make a difference that would actually work and not be a small interval before the cycle resumed they would.
If the majority of people aren't good enough for you consider this - you are ruled by the majority of politicians now, do think they give more of a shit about you personally than the average person? 
Whatever you think about the majority of people, the majority of politicians aren't people anyone would pick if they weren't made to choose from a selection of politicians.

It doesn't scale and it isn't nearly secure enough for serious use.
As for "just run some fraud analysis" - if that was a thing as simple as that we would have been able to eliminate fraud.
You'll have to do better than borrowing existing software to solve this in a way that is in anyway better than leaving the Bitcoin Foundation in charge because you can't borrow decentralised identity validation - it doesn't exist(and talking to strangers is hardly verification), you need to make something new.
No point replacing the Bitcoin Foundation with a different sort of centralised organisation - whatever it is, whatever insignificant task you give to them because you think they can be trusted with it, they will disappoint you.

The song-in-the-coin thing just doesn't do anything but the pairing music distribution with a cryptocurrency is full of potential.
Files(no reason to be song specific) on a peer to peer network that prevents art and information being censored - good.
Maybe as well as miners producing an index of files and transaction history you have hosts too - volunteers who like miners are rewarded for their participation in the network - good, provides good incentives for people to operate small scale where Bitcoin mining is no longer casual.
File creators get paid their share in the cryptocurrency, consumers buy with it.
There is lots of potential to integrate content distribution, media creation, media consumption and a cryptocurrency.
The value comes from having something to exchange it for - you buy a song and your client splits that between the file host and the content creator and you get the file.
That's the value people want, they don't want media in an intangible form inside money - they want to swap their money quickly and easily for stuff they want.

Those are different things, the transaction malleability link is misleading but DDOS attacks of all sorts will always be possible and will come and go, the problem with MtGox is of their own making and doesn't affect anyone else.
With MtGox in the news I'm not surprised you picked up on the DDOS attack involving transaction malleability but they are two different problems and there is no reason to be worried about transaction malleability - MtGox's problem was their own code, DDOS attacks can happen at various points but that doesn't mean those points need removing or replacing.

Hacked, rubber hosed, it shouldn't matter to us - we are being asked to trust ghash and the people behind it and that should set up the alarm bells.
The sudden climb is alarming because it means there is an entity somewhere that is willing to move power there and can back that up with actual hardware.
I was suspicious about all the coverage ghash got and how it was being reported as narrowly avoiding the end of Bitcoin.
So it gets fixed for a few days and springs back up? 
If we are sharing our wild guesses - it is being reported as a disaster so that now, when the hash rate bounces back, people will know to panic sell.
Someone with 20% of the network strength wanted to lower the price so they moved temporarily to ghash - scaring a bunch of people and causing them to panic sell.

I've always felt that wealth redistribution wasn't something Bitcoin did directly - it isn't something I want or need from Bitcoin.
Bitcoin isn't a shady black market currency to me - it will bring transparency, fairness (money can't be taken, only given and no authority is higher than that rule) and openness to a corrupt banking system leeching on the rest of us.
Most people don't want wealth redistribution they want a fair chance to earn and to have control over where that money goes - imagine if the government had to tag your tax data all the way through to where it left their hands and what that could begin to do to corruption and bureaucratic inefficiencies.
Bitcoin is a milestone - our grand kids won't believe governments used to take people's money and spend it on things no one wanted sometimes without telling anyone, that even some elected officials were kept in the dark about 'black projects'. That billions could routinely disappear.

I was replying specifically to comment that we should consider doing something because it "also would have psychological affect to the price!". We could do both, and potentially the move to bits *could* be a move towards a better, more understandable wallet, but that wasn't the comment I was answering.
The problem with tricking people to make the price go up so you can profit and sell is that it is exactly how the banking system was running before Bitcoin came along anyway and sure that will make a few of us richer but at the expense of Bitcoin's real potential - to empower everyone.
Bitcoin has the technology to revolutionise banking, but it has a community of people who will hype every little thing, sell out, buy back in, laugh at all the people they convinced to get in at the top; rinse and repeat.
The Bitcoin community has no affinity for delayed gratification - we know the software isn't ready for the mainstream, we know the education isn't good enough for everyone to be as safe with Bitcoin as they are with traditional banking. Bitcoin as a technology is plenty secure, but in the ways people *actually* use it, it is just isn't there yet - so now the community mostly requests things they think will net them the most return quickly.
We only have so many resources, even collectively - it is a shame greed is so many people's primary motivator, so much wasted potential.

I already stated that my problem is with the lack of diversity, not that the lack of diversity comes in the form of white people.
The only reason you would need to ask me that question is because you are still having trouble separating what you imagine I believe with what I've flat out told you.
You've already had your answer, you just need to admit to yourself that you've been wrong about your assumptions so you can begin to absorb what you've already been told.
You need to drop the denial, stop thinking "this question will get him, this will prove I was right the whole time, he has to be the person I think he is". Wanting it so hard is interfering with your ability to recognise and process the truth.

Accepting is the right word though you are right we should make the distinction between them accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment and accepting Bitcoin as an item to be listed - this is what I meant anyway, my post still stands.

It is a competitor - you pay with Bitcoin OR Paypal.
That they might change themselves to prevent losing the battle doesn't change the fact that they are right now in competition.
It would still be significant because eBay would then be functioning as an exchange and that would take a lot from them to comply with KYC laws.

Like I said, I understand fine but most of those people do have the ability to run server side code even though they decided to use a client side cart.
This solution is only for people for with no server side access at all because the rest would use the javascript cart with a server side checkout page for Bitcoin.
That is a very small group - people not willing to add server side code at all but wanting to accept Bitcoin through a shipping cart, just now it is just the OP.
I could replicate what PayPal does with their hosted payment pages for Bitcoin but my worry would be no one would need it because there are very few websites running shops completely without the ability to run code on the server.
Even if they've used a front end cart most legitimate businesses would be willing and able to add a checkout page for Bitcoin - I don't think a huge number of the unwilling and unable people will have heard about Bitcoin so that leaves me with a target market of the OP - it would be more profitable to consult with him directly than build an app only the OP will	 use.
Money on the internet should be handled like electricity in wires - there's a reason you get an electrician. If your business can't afford the cost of implementing Bitcoin - which may mean being able to pay someone to do the technical parts then your business should not accept Bitcoin.
If you can afford to take a 'that'll do' attitude to implementation you can afford to pay to have Bitcoin implemented properly.

Imagine this - I'm either going to threaten you or bribe you so that you vote for me - this means I have to know that you really did vote for me. If we used Bitcoin that would be really easy - you just sign a message to me with the same private key as you signed your vote with and I can look at the vote and see who it was for.
If you can't prove to someone else how you voted that goes a long way in securing elections because it eliminates a good amount of bribes and threats.
If we are going to open voting to a decentralised system we have to make sure it isn't being manipulated which means we need to be able to check and guarantee our own votes - if everyone sees their own votes were counted properly we are in the clear.
Traditionally - you could either prove your own vote was counted successfully OR have anonymous elections because whatever method you used to check your own vote (say a receipt) someone else could use and that's not good!
Cryptography allows the voter to see their vote and say "THAT ONE IS DEFINITELY MINE, I'M HAPPY AND CERTAIN" **HOWEVER** at the same time - while they can know that and be 100% on the truth of it, they don't get a receipt or a private key they could show someone else.
That means you can be sure about your own vote but you can never be sure of another person's vote and you can never satisfy a third party - you could, as far as they are concerned, say *any* vote is yours and you couldn't prove it and neither could they.
If we just use Bitcoin and pretend it isn't money I can prove my vote by signing something else with the same private key that I used to sign my vote with - that is why Bitcoin itself isn't suitable for serious voting because Bitcoin can't revoke access to a private key and private keys are too powerful in this context because it functions in ways we don't want and can't prevent.

No I am not, if anything I believe you are.
I believe they reached a lot of people with their name,  I don't think they converted a lot of customers and that's why I consider it a failure.
You could get a billion customers on day one of your launch, if your cost per acquisition is ten times your profit margin that's a failed ad campaign.
The CEO skipped with the remaining money because the ad campaign failed to drive the business he planned it to, the amount of business he budgeted the campaign on.
That's a failed campaign, even if because the CEO sucked at running it, the campaign itself failed and then Neo &amp; Bee failed.


No, it is proof I personally put a lot of time into monitoring the Bitcoin space - it is my success not theirs - and I first heard the Tagline AFTER they closed, when someone was laughing at newspapers running "Where's NEO?" ads so neither of us can be doing too great.

What makes you think I would be acting unlawfully? 
Just because I disagree with current politics doesn't mean I break the laws - where I live building and using such a system would be legal as long as you kept to the laws the existing government wants you to.
I'm not planning on breaking the law, I won't be in a cage.
I imagine people using the shadow government while living under the old, it will be an interesting comparison to actual laws and allow things to be broken in without any temporary crazy laws as pockets of extremists are absorbed. A teething period so people can see what laws they COULD have without serious consequences while adoption is low.
That continues until there is enough people to simultaneously {disavow, de-fund, quit jobs at, etc} the current government. With no money and not enough staff they couldn't punish people who didn't pay tax and it would implode as everyone else people started seeing the end and jumping ship.
It isn't illegal, it wouldn't require an armed revolution our any form of aggression towards the current government.

I think you have something and if the internet has taught me anything it is that if it is possible someone will do it.
You probably won't have to wait too long to see some sort of decentralised spending, it has so much potential someone has to get there eventually.
It is also likely to be part of the first decentralised market place (can't have people in charge, can't have nothing to stop fraud).
I think whatever people solve that problem with will apply to this and given the financial incentive I expect it soon.

Except I don't see that attitude anywhere.
Bitcoin doesn't need to do what Dogecoin is doing - getting its name out there - because people already know Bitcoin.
What we need to do now is construct the tech and the infrastructure so all the people who know about it can actually use it safely and if you keep up with the news you'll know that behind the closed doors that matter no one is waiting for wall street, they are all busy doing just that.
Dogecoin's mistake is thinking people will use it if they hear about it; truth is the technology needs work, serious work, and Bitcoin is putting far more of it in.
Dogecoin is one ad after another with no plan to convert people into users, sure 'look what Dogecoin did', but look what Bitcoin achieved.

The host should encrypt file to the client and send it, releasing the decryption key on payment with a trusted third party handling the exchange.

Do the OP a favour, be harsh. It will give them a chance to reevaluate their idea and gain the skills and experience they need to pull it off.
The OP would have to deal with people vocal about disliking their idea even if it was great but the chance to deal with someone honest doesn't come up that often.

Which is a good use.
Don't forget how much power the banks use and competition hasn't driven them to the same degree as Bitcoin mining has.
They still have the occasional machine from the 90s with code no one understands - ASICs are crazy efficient and it secures the network to where outside forces would need to create ASICs to attack Bitcoin, they couldn't repurpose other hardware because no amount of it would be enough without being crazy huge, crippling to run and death to assemble.

Who cares about pitchforks? I think you fundamentally understand the weapons with which this war will be fought and what the sides are - Bitcoin won't flourish outside of America because America won't be acting alone. The KYC laws are similar in many countries for the exact same reason Bitcoin's regulations will be similar everywhere. Watch the legal fluff accumulate, watch the barriers to entry rise, watch the laws be applied to the Bitcoin Foundation's members and used to influence who gets control of the reference client. This is a war of ideals, information(fought against an enemy that records our every email, every call and every forum post no less) and sustained effort - as soon as you stop correcting the lies people start believing them.
If the truth is inconvenient you just need to repeat a story long enough to get people to believe it - have you seen Fox News?
If you think continued existence is okay - Bitcoin will be a corpse on life support so people can say "it exists".
Just because there will always be something called "Bitcoin", doesn't mean they can't kill the revolution separately.
There are so many people that haven't heard of Bitcoin or that barely understand it that it or frankly care about the money and not the ideals(and if the money stays and the ideals go, they won't give a fuck) that you could pervert it into something unrecognisable, still call it "Bitcoin" and still satisfy enough people that any complainers will be dealt with like conspiracy theorists.
The people involved in Bitcoin for the ideals are but a rounding error of the overall user base, especially since as it spreads people will pick it up because it is money, not because it once stood for something.
All we do is plug it based on the value, how much it has gone up, how much it is going to go up... so we've attracted people who care about the value and that's it. We created an army of people who only want to succeed as individuals and are more than happy to do it at the expense of everyone else on their side. They may as well be the other side.
Last years userbase will be next years fundamentalists, you'll be like the Christians who don't eat fish on Fridays except you'll spend Friday harking back to when the limit was 21 million Bitcoin...

Paper, metal - anything electric or digital runs the risk of bit rot, failure, accidental death, reaching the end of its life, etc.
Hard drives are safer than USB keys but USB keys are meant to have a limited life span, I wouldn't trust either as my only backup longer than a few hours.
Paper copies are quite safe but you can also get etched metal wallets, those are safest.
There is no good digital backup solution - the ones that are safe are cloud based and therefore not as secure as I would like, the ones that are local aren't safe enough because they aren't redundant copies.

I want to start by saying I upvoted all your posts, I was hoping to add to the discussion not argue with you.


My point there was if you need to bring in people to code because they don't know how to (it is different if they could and haven't because of time constraints and just need more labour - that's a good strategy)that means all the work up until that point was done by people who don't understand something fundamental and the risk goes way up.
You don't want exchange code written in by PHP by someone who doesn't understand Bitcoin because that's how you get Mt Gox.

When you come to make a transaction just now you use a nonce that the wallet generates - a random number - that is where it would start to be a problem.
Here is what happened when an Android Wallet's Random Number Generator wasn't calculating random enough nonce's -  - it allowed people to take two transactions with the same nonce and public key to derive the private key and steal funds.
There are lots of places bad things could happen.

Wanting to own a company is stupid - it's the reason people got Gox'd in the first place - "oh hey, Bitcoin exchanges are a thing now, I'm going to be a rich day trader."... and it's gone.

Using Bitcoin for this shouldn't be the end game, so we can let those things slide with a mock election - if the problems are exploited then we wasted time voting but if it goes well we may worthwhile insights regarding what we are told about how people voted and how people actually vote - sounds like we win big or lose tiny, fuck it.
Before we could use this for something serious there would need to be serious development - for this we would build something specific and not just piggy back on Bitcoin.
Besides, philosophically we shouldn't treat voting (which should be intrinsic and the same for everyone no matter who you are) and money, which doesn't work if we always just have the same amount all the time.
There are solutions that fix those problems - that allow voting without a receipt, that allow an authority to restrict who can vote (to say, people actually from a given country) while preventing them from knowing how any single person voted - while still allowing a decentralised network to authenticate the process happened fairly.

Companies influence the laws now and when they do I always feel another inch fucked over.
They know what the profit margins on slaves are, they'll find ways to make money, give us less and give themselves more.
If money talks no one gets equality and since the rich people are the people in charge now there would be barely any practical difference in leadership.
The new boss would literally be the old boss.
I wasn't purposing communism, shops would price their own goods - I'm all for giving free market room to breath. As for the value of currency - free market exchanges will do that like they do with Bitcoin.
We can still vote to leave things be if that's really what is best.
I'm offering you some of what you want, if you were rational you'd be on my side - you'll never see the government you describe in your life time but you could work towards it by working with the people tearing down what we have now. You'll even get some of the changes you want.
Realistically, if you hold out on supporting change until you can get people behind the exact government you want then you get none of the things you want, you never dent the status quo.
I don't know what government we should have, I just want to give everyone equal power - nothing does that better than by giving them a vote.

You can pre-sign the transactions and share the signed transaction with the service without sharing your private keys with anyone which would mean they couldn't take your money, only send it to yourself earlier than you intended, if you are broadcasting after you detect a spend being sent to the network then even with a higher fee there is no guarantee you can stop it as they would be first to broadcast and their transaction could be with a miner before your client catches it.
If you require manual interaction such as a pin number that extra delay could be what costs you the race.

We never agreed to career politicians - we agreed to the baker who we see thrice we week representing us on his day off or to quit being a baker for a few years so he could represent his community by making laws that he would have to live by when he went back to being a baker.
Now politicians don't come from within and they don't join us once their time in government is up.
It is never up, they didn't just create a job out of representing us, they didn't even just create a career - they create a social class out of it.
All politicians are these days is a focal point for lobbyist, why vote for them when you can vote for yourself?

Not always - some bloat isn't transaction data, it is just data.
If stuffing crap into the blockchain becomes common place we'll all suffer - a good developer may go the extra mile to make their transactions prunable, one that can't think of a better database than Blockchain may not.
Over thousands of developers all reinventing sql in the blockchain it could get ugly.
Whatever happens today will happen thousands of times more frequently as adoption grows - look at how ugly the iTunes store is, when that level of content bloats the Blockchain people will either go to an alt chain or light wallet and full nodes are important.
This isn't 'I don't like your transaction' this is 'that isn't a transaction'. This specific use may never be a problem, but I can see the influx of developers trying to cash in outpacing Bitcoin's ability to process more transactions - I don't think we should panic but we should be more mindful of the complainers.

Because last year people got interested in Bitcoin as an investment.
The price went up.
People heard about the price going up and they too invested.
There was a bunch of negative press and the price didn't go up and because the new investors ignored the first rule - don't put in more than you can afford to lose - they had to.start pulling out and the price fell.
Behind all that usage was building.
A few big failures have made people more cautious, now there is bad press to give people pause and they've stopped taking out credit cards and puting everything all in.
Bitcoin matured.

That's not how the future works - you don't *need* to see it.
There are plenty of potential improvements to the blockchain that could reduce the cost of including transactions in blocks and allow miners to include much more of them.
There's no immediate danger, no need to change how fees are calculated.
What strengthens Bitcoin's value is keeping our word - we agreed there would be 21 million of them and we agreed on how they would be created and how miners would be rewarded. It doesn't do to have people jumping ship.

I'm not, I don't work for the government and if I did I would turn a blind eye to weed dealers as long as there's rapists and people cooking meth; the government on the other hand tends to have a hard on for easy to catch criminals like you who keep giving up personal information (like that they work at KFC) and who clearly couldn't put up much of a fight either in person or in court.

You keep referring to "intelligent people" and your own prowess in that regard like it is factual, far from giving you credibility - you being a complete stranger and all - it detracts from your otherwise sound arguments, except in this post where you put something I didn't say in quotes then skilfully defeated it instead of making a sound argument. There's not much merit to defeating what you imagined I meant.


There's no proof of that - just proof it'll be a lot more valuable to existing Bitcoin holders if it takes off - and if it does take off, we'll have the Satoshi and uBTC, both of which will be usable given their value after mass adoption.
The argument that we should work in smaller denominations is also a separate argument than the argument that we should call the units of that smaller denomination "bits".
You are defending having a smaller denomination but that isn't hard - I don't disagree smaller units may be useful - I'm as ready to accept "bits" as the name for that denomination as I am ready to send money over to the guy who said he'd sell me the Brooklyn Bridge.
There's also no defending the idea it all needs to happen NOW.
Bitcoin isn't ready for mass adoption NOW, it couldn't even handle the traffic.
If people aren't going to rush to buy Bitcoin while 1 BTC is the base unit then we should count our blessings and use the time to work on the infrastructure Bitcoin needs so that these users can USE Bitcoin instead of working out how we can SELL them Bitcoin now and make it work for them later.

File this under "not my problem" - you don't need to know and it would be pointless me giving you these answers at this stage when so much of the rest of the project is completely undefined and without input.
Since this is outside of your remit, I would do just as well supplying this part myself as asking you - it is equally not about either of us. I wouldn't waste a resource such as yourself by asking questions I could answer myself when there are still things I want from you that I can't get from someone else.
You aren't being asked to architect a solution that works for everyone else, you don't need to know about the people on the stage because by the sounds of it THAT ISN'T YOU.
Stick to your side of things - I'll ask the guy on the stage what he wants personally.
Just tell me what *YOU* want from an app, how *YOU* would expect to use it  and how *YOU* would expect to use it.

Why? Citation needed.
As far as I can tell, a lot of people think we need to spread adoption to people not technically equipped to secure or use Bitcoin because when people buy in the price goes up.


It's one thing to say we NEED to balance the negative exposure - but it is just rhetoric unless you show that without it Bitcoin will die.
Until then, its just something the pump and dumpers *want*.
Bitcoin is in its infancy - we aren't going to die just because we didn't fuck all our money away on useless ads and telling people about us for no good reason. Remember when the internet was young and the internet got TV ads?
ISPs advertise. "The internet" never needed it.
Bitcoin does not need it.
It is time to DEVELOP Bitcoin, not SELL it.
The problem is that now we have speculators and exchanges a lot of people bought into Bitcoin expecting it to be done already when they are just begining to realise that it will take YEARS for Bitcoin to develop.
When people say "Bitcoin is like the internet in the 80s" they mean - we've another decade of development work before it'll be a good idea for the general public to use it as a matter of course - but like with the late 90's a lot of people put money (and money they had to borrow or money they'll need for rent next month) into Bitcoin expecting it to work like a cash machine that'll pay out any minute now...
I can't believe Bitcoin is being described as being like the early internet and people are still investing like it is like the internet now. The description included the warning those investors needed.
The reason people aren't using it is because Bitcoin isn't there yet not because we haven't told enough people - impatient people who want to make money on price increases are just puting the pressure on and saying we NEED to do a bunch of things - like advertise.
It helps them.
That's all.
Bitcoin doesn't NEED to do any of that.
All immediate but useless awareness might do is drive up the price for all the people who weren't suckered into investing money into advertising some guy's investment fund - cause that's all this is - you bet the guy encouraging you to spend your money is keeping his just in case you manage to move the price because the effect of advertising is temporary and these people won't use Bitcoin anyway - it'll be a minor price spike at best.

Moving the conversation to gmail isn't better for the scammer security wise so I am going to assume they did it for convenience because they get email alerts to their phone and a greedy scammer is going to have a contract iPhone registered to themselves.
The OP has nothing to gain by believing the scammer did everything perfectly and a lot to gain by assuming otherwise.

It could be made to run a full node, the current versions of {all software here} aren't really optimised for that use case but it would be more than possible.
Bandwidth isn't really the issue because it'll use whatever you have, you could use a usb hard drive instead of an SD card and no, while larger SD cards aren't cheap the value of Bitcoin holds while the network is secure.
Realistically it isn't serving copies of the blockchain we need nodes for, it is relaying transactions we need more of(at least right now), maybe we don't need "full nodes" we need "relay nodes" and "storage nodes".
A raspberry pi could store all unpublished transactions it needed to in RAM and forgo storing the full blockchain and serve them fast enough to be an improvement on what we have now.

I kinda like the idea of a Bitcoin Tycoon.
I would love to know the more of technical details and about the people building it so I can ask more specific questions and see if there's anything I can help with.
I am tempted to build something similar, it is definitely the sort of game I would play based on some of the forum posts.
On objective I have a suggestion - the game starts on the date of the first Bitcoin block and ends when the time in the simulation reaches the time in the real life (you can scale the time in game based on how long you want them to last in real life).
Also when one player or pool mines {x} consecutive blocks in row a given cryptocurrency that cryptocurrency is dead(cross compatible mining rigs will also be offensive - leaving players with the choice of trading old gpu rigs for ASICS or keeping them to use against smaller alt coins later)and the scores for that currency are handed out - if you only held that currency then you are out until the game resets.
At the end winners are declared in various categories (most hashing power, most USD, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc), prizes awarded and the game reset - that will stop people gaining too large an advantage because they've been playing a while.
Maybe tie in-game currency values to donations received in that currency(capped at say a 30% boost), that gives them a reason to donate and to trade currencies in-game.
If you have in game trading you need to let people attempt double spends when buying equipment and trading between cryptocurrencies - reality exaggerated a bit because it is a game.

From a security stand point things just aren't there yet, I don't sell people on Bitcoin who don't have the technological background with which to understand it.
Otherwise you become tech support for the people who ignore you on what counts as a sensible amount to invest, invest their kids' college fund and lose it all installing yet another toolbar.
My elevator pitch is: there's some background reading, if it feels a little technical wait a year while more secure software is developed.
Nothing gets people interested like hearing they can't have something anyway.

You can criticize Bitcoin intelligently but for being here 3 years you went with "we need faster confirmations so I can transact quicker" - which for the reasons above, isn't true - what you said is exactly what most people say when they find out there is a 10 minute wait
Except they stop when someone explains reducing the confirmation time wouldn't reduce the wait because you would need more confirmations to be safe.
Suggesting lowering the difficulty so there are faster confirmations is not a good solution to anyone's problem, never mind yours and that is all you came up with - of course that didn't go down well, you were wrong.
I didn't downvote you, I explained why I thought you were wrong.
That isn't disallowing criticism, that is criticising your criticism.
I find it amusing how when people are shown that they are wrong, rather than say "Ah, I see now!, I was frustrated and annoyed at the situation which I could have handled differently and I see changing Bitcoin is not the answer to how I feel personally" you claim to be censored for expressing an unpopular opinion when no one has stopped you talking at all.
I'm all for criticising Bitcoin when the criticism is well thought out, it is the only way we will be able to improve it - by being honest about what is really wrong and what really needs done.
I get it! I understand being annoyed at something you aren't able to change. You have to understand that from the point of view of someone who isn't frustrated and annoyed with not getting the price I wanted on an exchange this exact moment your post is just you venting, you aren't having a conversation, you are just complaining about what irks you - that's okay, but we can't all change things because you are pissed.
It is okay to vent, but people aren't going to agree with you when you aren't right.
The reason I know about the bank outage - that's my fucking bank and I was one of the mugs who got to checkout and couldn't buy food! I get it, I really do. But you haven't came up with a solution that actually works so I can empathise with your situation but I can't agree with your solution.
It isn't because you can't say negative things about Bitcoin, it is that if you want people to take up your solution it has to be something every newb doesn't suggest until they are told why its wrong.
I get that you are frustrated at the circumstances that have meant this one time you can't turn around your Bitcoin on a dime, but it isn't a problem with Bitcoin, it is a problem with not keeping money on an exchange when the minute to minute price matters to you.
Don't take it personally, I'm wrong all the damn time and the nature of Reddit means that if I've even made a spelling mistake someone will be along to tell me.
Don't feel it is a criticism of you, it is helping you move past "faster confirmations" because who knows, once you accept that isn't the answer you might move on and think of something that is.

Given the way you calculate the reward in the OP, there will come a point where mining two blocks and appearing to have 25% of the network power between two people will be more profitable than mining 1 block with 50% as a single user.
Besides - I cared about the rest of my complaints a lot more - even if you can make the maths work I'm not sold on the idea that you should.
Just now I buy on the assumption that 1 Bitcoin is roughly 1 of 21 million total coins - if I keep having to adjust that 21 million to account for burned coins the entire thing becomes more complicated and I lose interest and move to a coin where everything is very simple and clear - because I'm a human being and that's what comforts me and that's what comforts everyone of the potential users of your coin.
I'd rather have mining pools than having people destroy money for a chance at mining a block.

If they over invested they should fail.

Yeah but all they need to be told is that they are wrong.
It isn't a real barrier, it is imaginary - it doesn't matter when we fix it - even if we made the switch to bits universally the backend code would still run on satoshis. It is a purely cosmetic fix to drive up adoption, if you value a smaller community so we can reach a consensus on other issues then this shouldn't be a priority right now. We can do it later; once the real issues have been solved we can tackle imaginary ones.
There's no reason to prioritise this problem, the people that need told Bitcoin has decimal places just like all other currencies and still don't get it are the very people who won't follow the proper steps to secure their wallet - the changes to the way wallets work and the way we teach people how to use Bitcoin needs developed first for the benefit of the very same people the bits change is supposed to help... except they need the other things more than the change to bits otherwise the only thing they'll be able to do is better describe how much money they lost.

I claim that its size today is not a sign of how big it will stay, this is an aggressive move by some big players.
They are bringing legislation to NY with regards to cryptocurrency because someone with the money to make shit happen asked for it. We all know a lot of legislation is written by lobbyists and that is why larger companies don't fear it, they get to write it, you have to ask "who pulled these strings and do I really trust someone with that much power to pass laws and go back to sleep? Do I dare assume they used their influence to create legislation but have no plan to use it?" because I would bet that by the time you get to where you have this level of influence you also have a plan.
This isn't happening in isolation, it is a foundation.
I would bet that there is a large amount of money in the current financial system that someone wants to move into Bitcoin but can't because Bitcoin's legal framework does not allow them to and now they've taken steps to fix things.
Bitcoin's financial sector will explode when people with existing fiat wealth wade in. The fact that they've waited should tell you something. We aren't talking about people who aspire to have money, we are talking about people who have billions. They don't care about where other people will go, they are going to set up where is good for them and it seems they've been smoothing out NY.

In my country 44% of the people eligible turned out to vote.

Unless the person able to compromise your machine also compromises the online service, either directly by attacking the service or by acquiring your login details - in which case, the attacker is back to having 2/3 keys.
The kind of person who needs to secure their computer from themselves is the kind of person who'll save the password to the online service in their browser.
The cure for them is read-only deterministic hardware wallets - sold in a way that lets the user set the seed key once after sale, never lets them install anything hell doesn't even have the capacity to have things installed.
Deterministic because they need to be made in a way that not even the keys can be changed because if there is any write access to the device at all it will be misused.

There are parts of the transaction that can be changed before they are included in a block.
It is an ID - it doesn't change the amount of money or where it goes.
MtGox used the ID in their internal database, people changing it messed with their database and they couldn't find payments, so they made new payments to people who already got paid.
It isn't a problem because now people track transactions based on the inputs which cannot change instead.

It won't be - I think the blockchain gives inspiration on how we could truly decentralise transactions and we should use that inspiration to build new things.
As a developer I can see how easy it would be to hack together things that use the blockchain instead of a database including a system of voting however the problem of securing voting deserves more attention, less cludgyness and some straight up respect.
There's no good reason not to build something separate and plenty good reasons to do so.
We can do so much better than co opting a currency and that comes with the obvious benefit of votes not being money - there's no point in building a new system where the people with the most money have more power, we have that system now.
We can do better than the blockchain for voting - the blockchain is good for money, that's it - we can make it more secure, more verifiable, more suitable.
There's lots of places where using Bitcoin for voting would be too prone to abuse because Bitcoin is meant to secure money not votes.

You think a company that was turning over hundreds of thousands of dollars a week would be limited to one deposit address because you are? 
When you get that size your trades aren't always posted publicly by the exchange.
The OP is exaggerating the risk for comedic effect - of course these companies employ people who are aware that their private information can be used against them and I would bet that eventually one of them slips up and it will be exploited anyway... but like the Target credit card balls up it will go away and screw ups aren't unique to Bitcoin.
World won't end, Bitcoin won't suddenly die.
Mixers may not necessarily be made illegal, there is a good privacy argument for them and they are hard to prevent - if you commit to making them illegal you have to commit money to policing it and since that isn't easy or profitable it becomes a money and a time sink.
The fact that Bitcoin allows it to be used without massively tainting and making identifiable all the Bitcoin you own means when someone does screw up a significant number of people will realise it isn't Bitcoin's fault and continue to use it.
Being possible to screw it up isn't a fatal flaw, it is a people problem - go to Google and look at all the credit card hacks and leaks - people forgive.

I feel if people waited until there was enough money in the ASIC market to cause manufacturers to make and sell them that there would have been a chance things went better, as it is - everyone tries to sweep the rug out of the existing miners and hope the next batch doesn't do the same to them.
Okay, you are right - it is hard to be sympathetic when impatient greed loses people their money, but people used to mine just to keep the network going, if it wasn't so cut throat we'd have more of them.

He's entirely wrong to ascribe that feeling to "liberals" just because he (and you) feel that's what liberals are and do.
Specifically, he ascribed it to me - you are dead wrong that I think that "not diverse enough" is the same as "too white".
If the only person actually here saying something disagrees with this guys imagined foes then how is he "kinda right"?
He's right about people who aren't here, who he can't actually point at, who a lot of people feel must exist somewhere but no one is willing to say who they are.
That's not being "kinda right", that's "feeling right", which isn't the same.
It isn't interesting. It's old and inaccurate.
The idea that people who want diversity really just hate white people has been recycled so many times it wouldn't be fit for the toilet paper schools use.
Calling people "liberals" is the new calling people "commies".
It isn't interesting, its the same old bullshit said with conviction instead of presented with evidence and a bunch of people "feel" it is right, regardless of the lack of evidence - say, like with vaccines and "death panels" - and "feeling right" turns into "well, I think it so it can't be wrong".

Really? You care so much about MY opinion that you think because **I** don't see an alternative TODAY that there will NEVER be one? You must think I'm very important! I'm not.
Before Bitcoin only 1 person on the planet imagined Bitcoin as it is today. You think it won't be changed? Adapted? Improved? Replaced? You think Bitcoin is a permanent success?
It won't be and that is GOOD.
Eventually there will be a usecase not covered by Bitcoin that will warrant replacing or adapting Bitcoin to where it can no longer be considered the same as we have today.
This is good. This is the natural progression of technology. Can you imagine if we based all our assumptions of the internet never advancing beyond AOL dial up? Newsgroups? 
I can imagine something replacing Bitcoin in 100 or 1,000 years - the fact that I don't know how it will work doesn't matter, doesn't make Bitcoin immortal.
Bitcoin like everything else has a finite lifespan, I hope it has a very long run but the chances of it existing indefinitely and never being surpassed in any form are minuscule. I look forward to progress, whenever it may come.
It will come.

'That is why it[Bitcoin] isn't secure' is what you said and I think you are wrong - Bitcoin is perfectly secure, people skipped learning because they were greedy and believed the earlier they got in the more they would make.
When they lost money it wasn't Bitcoin's fault.
Even the best bank vault in the world doesn't work if you don't lock it.
If the average person won't follow best practices then Bitcoin isn't ready to have them use it with significant funds.

 This is called an Exchange - unless you have at least a few hundred thousand dollars you should stop now.
First - securing funds - Bitcoin is not reversible, PayPal is. People will cry fraud and get a full refund.
Guess who the customers expect to pay for that? 
Second - the law - exchanges have to follow very strict antifraud and money laundering laws, reach will require full time staff the second you open. You can't run without it until you start making money.
You have to collect documentation on people and verify it, it is a pain in the ass.
The reason there aren't more exchanges isn't because they are hard to code, there aren't more because they are expensive to open.
Unless you've a lot of money to throw at this you should give up - there are other Bitcoin related projects that a developer could do with no start up money, this just isn't one of them.

As a developer I considered working on a decentralised market place but when I looked at what would need done it turned out to be far too much work and time involved for me to just do it as a personal project because it would take hundreds to thousands of hours of work with little to no guaranteed monetary return at the end.
Weeks to months of full time work to get the project started and at least a few hours every week after that bug fixing etc.
Because of its nature it isn't something you could sell, isn't something you could jam ads into -  it isn't something you can really monetise at all except by receiving donations for the development because even if you coded into it a commission for the developers they could not accept it!
If someone sold drugs on such a marketplace and the developer was given commission the developer would go to jail.
That means the only way this is ever going to happen is if it is donation funded.
This would be a lot of work by itself but you also have to throw in the fact that no one else has done it successfully yet, you aren't looking for an open source clone of something tried and tested you are looking for a pioneer.
Although it sounds fairly simple to ask for it, it is a lot of work involved - unless that demand can fund the development it will be a long time coming. If we guestimate 1,000 hours of work an assume that someone could do 3 hours a day, 7 days a week you would still be waiting 166 days - since on top of a fulltime job that would be a super human schedule it is more than a big ask to expect someone to just build it.
It could need a lot more work than that!
This isn't a hobby project, it is a temporary job.
Seeing how quickly people threw themselves at the Sheep Marketplace (seriously, clue is in the name!) and the Silk Road V2 it seems people will still trust centralised marketplaces run by people they don't know so there isn't enough demand for it, not enough to go through all the time it would take to create all the documentation to impress people enough they would crowd fund it.
I think this idea will have its time, but I think a few more people need to get arrested for trading trading on an insecure network before the lesson is driven home.
It is hard to gauge interest here without sinking in a lot of time - sure, the post always gets upvotes whenever it is suggested but nothing comes of it.
My current hobby project (which some of you will have seen me mention!) I expect to take far longer but at the same time I don't feel any need to rush it because I think if I finished it tomorrow people wouldn't be ready to use and accept it yet. As my project is a Bitcoin spiritual descendant so to speak I feel my idea will be more acceptable to people as they learn to love Bitcoin and related services like a decentralised market place and I would be more than willing to commit some time to it because it would advance my other work but with the amount of work required I couldn't just do it for free.
The problem is this doesn't need "some time" - this needs a lot of it and with dedication to match.
I would either have to quit my job or have to work on it for so long it won't be worth waiting on me to finish.

If you need this solution it is because someone compromised your private keys, probably from the computer you have your client installed on - so they could compromise your client's panic button.

You make the process more complicated but in return they get to use Bitcoin... But that means I'd be down Bitcoin and time instead of just money.
However, I do think there is a place for you - there must be people who've been gifted small amounts or with a little extra they are looking to spend.
I think the gift certificate is preferable to giving you my details and an item to order and hoping you store my details safely and don't misuse them and get my order right when you have to re-place it.
It also means if there is an issue with my order because of Amazon I don't have to contact Amazon and have you contact them.

You realise it is the NODES that have to come to a consensus not miners?
People think miners validate blocks for the rest of us, they do not.
They do validate transactions before including them in blocks because if they did not the blocks would not be accepted by the network and it would be time wasted but every full client validates and checks work received from every miner and since it is the nodes deciding whether to ship or not based on a transaction existing (or not), they are the ones doing the majority of the validation they are the ones you need to convince.
That means you would need to get a majority consensus from 51% of nodes, not miners.
If the miners all voted against and the nodes all voted for, the miners would cave.
If miners all voted to make a change that no one else was willing to implement, they'd just be publishing invalid blocks that would get ignored by the network.

The problem is anonymous is easy if everyone can vote because you don't care who anyone is.
On the flip side if everyone has to register to vote and you can check votes are from registered voters then you can know which voters.
You can't trust votes are from the correct source while keeping voters anonymous without an authority very easily because where an authority can have secrets a decentralised network doesn't
It is doing them all together that is hard and you are right, they are all worth the trouble - the fact that they are so hard to combine is why there is a lack of working decentralised voting platforms despite it sounding like an easy problem - counting from a list - there are real pitfalls.
No one has completely cracked it yet.

You can require 2 out of 5 keys to sign a transaction for example but then 2 signatures would always be valid - that is, if your family members haven't died 2 of them could take all the money.
These aren't really the best uses of multi sig though.
With the employee payroll, the funds should be coming from a company account so the death shouldn't change that so they would just start funding a new payroll key.

I reached you anyway. That was sincere.
I saw your username - you just have no idea how stubborn I am.
You can socially prove one person one vote by signing one key for every person and once you've signed a persons key you dye their hand or tick off their name from a list or however your local authority already handles paper ballots.
It is completely transferable.
Votes are only accepted if they are signed by the correct key - which is created and destroyed in front of everyone and never travels.
Signed keys are kept by the network so more keys than people can't be created - no extras.
Only votes signed by a key which is in turn signed by the correct authority and which was broadcast during the signing window for that organisation count towards the elections.

I'm not going to miss Gigabytes but that's'not the point.
Whatever is done by one person now will be done by thousands of people when Bitcoin adoption grows and you won't be able to turn just *some* developers down.
If you decide it's okay now that's a few megabytes per project. Just wait until there are hundreds of thousands of them, half of them are incredibly buggy or coded so badly the outputs aren't prunable or so much more resource intensive they use GB's each not MB's - you can't turn down or vet developers, look at iTunes App store and look at the crap there. That's WITH Apple removing the worst ones and turning some down.
Just bundling everything with Bitcoin and the Blockchain shows a lack of imagination and real solutions for most projects so the best news is a lot of these projects will be still born and won't grow large enough to bother anyone.
Storing thousands of permenant redundant copies of those dead aps is wasteful and I don't think the fee covers the load on everyone forced to carry it - it is one thing storing transaction data, that's part of the social contract, but I don't think using it as a file system is going to benefit anyone except the developers who have realised using 'Blockchain' in their app description gets downloads regardless of whether there was a good argument for using it.
I didn't agree to be anyone's SQL replacement.
You have to assume that whatever happens to the Blockchain now will happen at the same rate as it grows - I'm not worried about a few MB, I'm wondering how long it takes before everyone thinks they should get their own few MB.

As a developer I hear stories from people like you a lot.
I inherited a project where the password used in the code to move and handle money had been set to 'changeme' for four years before I altered it.
I saw a call centre where they were processing payments and they hired people to set up call logging.
They had all the phones save calls as mp3 files on a public network share with no read/write restrictions.
For the less technically minded: those calls were people reading out their credit card numbers, names, addresses,.dates of birth, etc and they could be downloaded by anyone within wifi range without a trace.
These things tend to get discovered after they go wrong.

No - it really is code by the seat of your pants and it isn't healthy long term.
The good thing about Bitcoin is that anyone could create an official specification because whatever specifications is used by most clients will be the correct one, even if it doesn't come from the Bitcoin Foundation.
I would normally suggest, since they maintain the reference client, that documentation be their job but if they wanted that job they would be doing it already instead of hopping users and the wiki takes care of it.
This will get worse as more and more custom clients come into play and the official client gets used less and less (at least until pruning) because any slight differences will have an impact - there needs to be coordination and cooperation.

The Dollar, Pound and Euro don't need a community, I imagine that when Bitcoin is technologically ready (it isn't right now!) for the average user it won't need a community either and I imagine developers will just find somewhere else (Bitcoin Talk not being it).
We don't NEED to talk people around and sell them on Bitcoin - the new Bitcoin rich and the would be Bitcoin rich would love everyone to think otherwise because adoption drives do wonders for the price - because it will continue to develop to where it is ready for mass adoption regardless of r/Bitcoin.
Sure, a few newbs might not like it here, but long term there's no need to worry. 
Even if r/Bitcoin put off 100% of visitors it isn't a big deal, Reddit is just a corner of the internet and we are but a corner of it. Bitcoin isn't ready for the level of user who would take advice from r/Bitcoin, if they stopped coming here to get advice it wouldn't be terrible for anyone involved. 
When we went from a community of people who wanted Bitcoin to succeed to a community of people who wanted Bitcoin to make them rich (and who sunk money they can't lose into it!) we lost the ability to talk with the doubters and trolls.
People here are just too emotionally involved in the price to consider negatives or to engage trolls at a level below 'taking the bait'.

In the Wild West you have someone with a bigger gun (actually not true - there were very few shootouts in the real West...) or a smaller gun they could pull out quicker or whatever and you give them your money money so they don't kill you (or they take it after...) and if you put it in a safe or a train they'd take your safe or rob your train.
In Bitcoin someone can ONLY get your money if you give them it. I'm still VERY happy with the present system because I didn't come across the phrase "due diligence" AFTER I *gave* someone all my money.
Did they use escrow? No.
Did they demand a business plan with the spending accounted for? No.
Did they demand any form of oversight or checks and balances as a condition of handing over the money, you know - before you hand it over, when you have leverage? NO.
Bitcoin has a VERY low bar to entry, because all the software is at a very early stage all the cool developer tools that normally software would hide (like the actual characters of the private keys and the bizarre strings that represent addresses) are still there. There's no one standing over you making sure you shoot yourself in the foot and no one has invented a safety yet.
Bitcoin will develop. Bitcoin will become usable for users with very little technical experience. It isn't yet.
That aside - these people voluntarily handed money over to a stranger who said they would give them shares in a company in another country without any real business plan, background checks, anything.
They just handed it over.
No duress, no pressure, just greed.
I'm sad because someone deceived them but I don't consider it a black mark against Bitcoin, you can't blame Bitcoin for something people did of their own volition - it isn't for Bitcoin to deny them freedom to spend their money and for that I am assured it will not prevent me spending mine.
I am very happy with the present system.

You tell people to send you money, then have you send it to their friends so that their friends will use Bitcoin.
You literally operate a service that only works if other people let you hold "their" money.
You may say "don't do this" - but you show people that there are sites that'll hold your money for them and that's cool - and regardless of what you SAY, that message, will be their introduction to Bitcoin.
If your site works because you are good people but teaches a bunch of people to be suckers, are you doing good?

Oh I'm all for education.
I'm just not for making the subject matter shitty instead of spending more time and money teaching people properly.
However, comparing browsing the internet to the DENOMINATIONS used in Bitcoin is stupid.
The barrier to entry that was browsing with lynx is not the same level of barrier as realising you can buy fractions of one Bitcoin.
"Here are all the commands you need" is not "you can buy half a Bitcoin if you want". It shouldn't take the average person long to understand fractions of a Bitcoin because currency already has a decimal point in most countries.
Bitcoins denomination barrier is already quite low - we don't need to lower it, we need to help people over it - the people who don't want to learn on the other hand can be left behind. They will be replaced by smarter people when they die.
I'm always for improving education but when I hear "wit ya readin' fur" I don't think we should change reading to accommodate that guy, I think "they still make you?".
If you lower your standards every time you meet someone who "doesn't get it" you won't have standards, you'll have "derps" and for simplicity "one derp" will be worth the same as "a million derps" and I'll "derp you derps" and you'll be my "derp I derped my derps to using derp". You might as well paint yourself blue, shrink to three apples high and call yourself a smurf and do away with money completely.
Educational improvements happen by necessity - people where I live can by a huge majority read and write at a basic level now because they NEED to.
If they can't mentally handle that you can buy less than a whole Bitcoin even though they already deal with up to 1/100th of a Dollar what makes you think they will ever be able to use Bitcoin securely and safely anyway?
Leave these guys with the banks for now so they've someone to complain to when they send all their money to a Nigerian Prince - if you get them into Bitcoin and lose everything picking "correct horse battery staple" as their brain wallet they won't thank you.
I'm not elitist - I believe everyone should have free access to all the education they want and I believe they should have help learning if they need it; I just don't believe we should make lessons easier so we can pat ourselves on the back because so many people "passed".
We shouldn't make our standards worse, we should make education *better*.

I also believe the person who makes the initial assertion has to prove it, they don't just get to put forward anything they think proves their case and then demand evidence in return.
All they've proven is the percentage of code written by volunteers versus full time developers - they are yet to prove pros or cons as a result.

If you think the politicians are educated by anyone except lobbyists, your awakening will be painful.
If you believe that the same uneducated people can't do more damage now by getting behind a useless figurehead once every 4 years than by getting behind 1 single useless idea at a time every day for 4 years then I don't think we'll ever agree.
Just now all they have to do is support 1 idiot every 4 years and the consequences last 4 years - if they had to vote on individual issues they'd do far less damage because they wouldn't keep up 4 years worth of voting.
Those same uneducated people get a vote now - they should, they are people first and uneducated second. Besides - the politicians are allegedly smarter than the rest of us - how's that working out?
The more things there are to vote on the more sparing people would be with their voting - they would stick to their interests because there's too much to vote on everything and I mean that in a literal sense - in a society where everyone voted and there was no politicians, 24 hours a day wouldn't be enough to weigh in on every issue personally.

"Correct Horse Battery Staple" is not a "sophisticated statistical attack" - it is stealing something from a comic because you think it is cute without stopping to consider you may not be so brilliant as to be the only person with that idea.
I didn't call people idiots, I called them morons. Not all people who ever lost Bitcoin, I just picked on people with an XKCD based brain wallet.


No, I'm calling them morons because they lost money because they were so on the bandwagon they had to rush to get Bitcoin, even though they didn't know enough about Bitcoin to know the options they had to keep it safe. They NEEDED Bitcoin RIGHT NOW even though they didn't really understand it - that is how children spend pocket money, it shouldn't be how adults spend wages.
They are morons for wanting something before they knew what it was, not because it makes me feel better about myself - it makes me feel worse about what we will be able to achieve in the future if people are so lazy with money they can't afford to lose. It severely limits long term adoption potential for lots of projects, not just Bitcoin, because you need to be able to hold people accountable for their own fuck ups.

I've been working on cryptographically secured voting for over a year now and have come to the conclusion verification should be a social issue not a technological one.
With that in mind my design runs almost the same way as voting now - in person verification.
It can be a once every x years key signing / exchange event just like ballot booths are now except that one event can be used to enable people to vote on multiple things without further verification.
I would be more then happy to dye my hand blue at an open event where the keys used to sign everyone's keys as belonging to someone entitled to vote were created and destroyed in full view of everyone.

I know - the OP asked about the value of his Bitcoin, you are arguing with me saying the value will go down because people will trade Blacklist Bitcoin for Whitelist Bitcoin.
That's stupid.
The only reason the Swiss guy is going to trade his Whitelist Bitcoin with someone with Blacklist Bitcoin is because he is going to make a profit on that trade because the guy with Blacklist Bitcoin who lives in a Blacklist country NEEDS the Whitelist Bitcoin or he can't spend it.
Like the people selling their Gox coins, they'll take a hit on the value.
The answer to the OP is that if laws passed affecting his Bitcoin specifically it would be worth less than it would be if no laws passed.
The fact that people can trade with other countries is irrelevant - the Swiss guy isn't going to trade 1 Bitcoin for 1 Bitcoin - he doesn't need to trade, he has no motive to trade, except profit, so he's going to want more in return and the other guy will agree because it's his only move if he wants to buy shit on Amazon.

With buying a car, people need a car.
With decentralised voting there are SO MANY possible issues that a single person couldn't vote on everything if they did nothing else until they died.
It is unlikely ignorance will be a big long term problem because you wouldn't know about the issues you are ignorant of to vote on them and even if you stumble by a few issues you lack the experience to vote on the rest of the people voting on that issue will be at least interested in the issue.
With some same checks and balances it would be a lot less insane than the current system.
The current system passes laws because corporations lobby them not because it is any good for us and a good number of politicians are as ignorant as anyone.
The current system is full of problems and the worst one is it takes forever to fix anything - you could pass a shitty law tomorrow, the people could hate it and we'd be stuck with it years anyway.
People will always make mistakes but in a world where we all (and not just the old guys that 'represent' us) get a vote we would change our votes and the law quicker.

They don't need to control the supply - there are enough people with Bitcoin willing to trade their Bitcoin for fiat that people with large amounts of fiat can access Bitcoin at will. They don't need to be able to mine, they have money, they can buy.
They just need to be able to stop some coins being accepted in some places, being spent in some ways, and they most definitely can.
If you blacklist &lt;coins suspected of being involved in drug sales&gt; and make that blacklist law in the USA, Amazon will not accept those coins, neither will any other US company and therefore neither will smart US citizens. This is just one simple example.
While you can't makes laws shutting Bitcoin down, you can most definitely pass laws on what retailers can accept and they WILL be followed because retailers follow the money. If they can't accept X list of Bitcoins, they just won't. Their customers will have to find a way to pay them with Bitcoin not on the list.
Amazon is not going to accept drugcoins to prove a point to the government and to make a stand. If the law passes it will be followed. The more people with influence get involved in Bitcoin and hedge their bets on its success the less they will be happy to play on an even playing field and the more they will lobby for laws that favour them; and there are plenty of potential there, despite Bitcoin's decentralised nature.
Maybe they pass laws saying that you need to be able to prove tax payments to &lt;government address&gt; within the last 5 transactions of a given stack of Bitcoin or those coins cannot be used but guess who will get a huge tax rebate and guess who won't?
It isn't like we don't have masses of evidence that proves that there are countries that will collude to make favourable laws between them, the NSA/GHQ spying should have killed off that conversation months ago so being international won't help - maybe we'll have coins that can only be spent in &lt;countries here&gt; that get traded lower than the base price as a result. Bankers will not lose sleep over it.
Look at fiat banking. Bankers WILL take advantage of anything that favours them personally.
Bitcoin is not immune to legislation. Currently, it is hard to imagine some of the tougher laws because you can't force changes to the client code or the network and people see that and take a sigh of relief - the problem is that isn't where the laws will target - they will target retailers first because retailers are less likely to ignore a law they believe they won't get caught for, especially larger ones that have their books scrutinised. As soon some coins can be spent in less places than other coins, you end up with two "types" of Bitcoin with different values and as soon as you have Bitcoin worth less than other Bitcoin the type worth less will be less desirable.
Think of all the miners who never paid tax - who've been trading and holding this whole time, people who traded earlier on with coins that went through the silk road one time - laws could reset their wealth if rich people decided it would benefit them enough.
Bankers will LOVE Bitcoin - if it is going to increase in value considerably all the bankers will be able to buy in at a huge profit. We aren't going to leave them behind, we are going to take them along with us and when they start jumping on board the game will change.
These "ground up" exchanges run by the Bitcoin community will be in the minority if Bitcoin takes off, large corporations will want to enter the market and they will enter it forcefully. They will enter it after lobbying for legal protection.
Bankers are not shaking in their boots wondering why their system has been surpassed - they've got fucking rich under that system, it is still doing them well and is still the system used by the vast majority of people and before Bitcoin over took traditional banking there will be plenty of time for them to convert their wealth and profit from the change over.

That would be gravy if any company held your Bitcoin, but it doesn't - that's not how brain wallets work.
The whole point of a brain wallet is you create the wallet from the phrase and the phrase needs to be unique or someone can access your wallet - this should be apparent when you can recreate your own wallet with just the passphrase teaching you that someone else with your passphrase can do the same - if you haven't read enough to understand that you haven't done the necessary legwork to trust your money in that wallet, it is irresponsible to send your money to a wallet that can be controlled by an attacker who guesses your passphrase without doing any background reading on the subject.
Bitcoin is new, Bitcoin is in development - if you don't want to do the reading you need to wait until much further down the line when all the kinks are worked out and it has been idiot proofed.
You want to put your money in this early but don't want to put any time into understanding how it works? Fine. Just don't expect to do a good job of it.
That's why we say "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose" - because there will be people who think they don't need to read anything and they will lose everything. It is avoidable. Choosing not to learn is moronic.

I worked on this for a while before I moved onto something a bit more achievable so I might as well share, I came up with automated challenge / response.
Eg: Before you pay out, the person who uploads the file can challenge the host on any part of the file - eg: from 10% in to 45% in and from 66% to 67.5555% in.
Or - byte 4 to byte 22 + byte 25 to byte 40 + byte 99 to byte 122.
Any collection of arbitrary points - the more the merrier.
To get paid, the host has to hash those specific parts of the file and respond with the hash to prove they still have the file.
By requesting random boundaries of the file are hashed the host needs the file to produce the hash and can't produce the hashes in advance - you can keep requesting random points of the file be hashed until you are satisfied they are calculating hashes from the file and not from a pre-stored list of hashes.
If the host doesn't have the file they can't pass this step and can't get paid.
The person uploading the file can either keep a copy and use it to verify the file is hosted OR could pre-calculate a given set of "hash-points" to be used to later verify that file.
If you don't want to run such software yourself the solution is to have one set of people paid to host files and a separate set paid to check the hosts are honest on your behalf.
As to proof of bandwidth - I say - WHY - the bandwidth isn't important, the files are.

It is relevant to the whole financial industry, if you have to ask "what is New York's relevance to the financial industry and what pull do they have" that re-frames your post for me.
Bitcoin will be traded for dollars and like with the NYSE profitability comes with high frequency and high speed - they are going to want to locate their Bitcoin financial services close to their NYSE financial services because it will be the same companies providing both and there's profit to be had in arbitrage from locating yourself practically in the NYSE.
People are always complaining banking laws are too lax but they still exist; I would wager this is the result of someone wanting to move money from the NYSE or similar but being unable to because the Bitcoin legal framework isn't there so they legally can't move money out of a legitimate bank or financial institution into Bitcoin and these proposals are specifically to pave the way for these players.
You don't just pass laws, you pass a law because you have a reason, a motive. Someone asked for this.
This is not meant to deal with the situation "at the moment", this is meant to pave way for the future.

Then the problem isn't that 1MB/s isn't enough, it is that the client is too stupid to realise when it is connected to somewhere shitty and could potentially find a better peer.
We should fix THAT bug instead, cause some people would be completely satisfied with a 1MB/s node.
The problem isn't with nodes that run at 1MB/s, its with clients who don't put their spare bandwidth to use if they've made a shitty connection.

If there is remote access to the sensitive parts of the system from one of the developer's houses then they won't steal the physical servers, they'll wait for him to come home and hit him with a rubber hose until he logs in for them.

If ever there was a case for alt chains, proof of existence and transactional databases are that case. A blockchain fits perfectly with a transactional database model, it just isn't easy because unlike Bitcoin now, there's nothing to borrow.
Shoehorning those things into the blockchain on the other hand is a terrible plan, you can't influence the blockchain or stop it changing and if the blockchain reaches a point where there is more data than cash people will go to alt coins anyway.
By comparison, create your own chain and you have flexibility to add features instead of having to stick data into something meant for something else.
The early rush of easy ideas will be decimated by the second wave of good ideas and Bitcoin will carry the corpses of every failed app that tried to use it until Bitcoin itself dies.
Anyone thinking that's okay is thinking short term - think tens of thousands of shitty apps with thousands of users each.

Given time there will be more secure clients that enforce sensible practices onto the users who would otherwise skip steps and until then they just have to stay away or take responsibility for their own mistakes.
It stays their fault not Bitcoin.
I don't care if that slows down adoption, I just refute the claim of insecurity. I would be happy to see adoption slow - it lowers the greed on both sides.
No one is sending money to an obscure company in Japan because there's a dollar in it for them and all the people leaving money on the exchange were doing it because they wanted to flip quickly.
Bitcoin's problem is greed not security.

 You can do so much of Bitcoin without third parties and the people involved in Bitcoin are technical enough to be happier using server side code - there's no demand for the less technical solution you want.
I know exactly what you mean, since most people don't have unreasonable requirements for their online store like 'no server side code' there aren't developers lining up to fix your problem.
If I thought it would help Bitcoin adoption I'd consider building something but the problem is that there are very few people running websites without the ability to run code on the server so I'm not sure how many months it will be before someone else asks.

I mean quite simply that while there is in theory steps you can take to guaranteeing the safety of your private keys and wallet that in practice no one will take them.
It isn't a hand waiving generalising, it is an established pattern of behaviour - users routinely screw up. In Bitcoin mistakes are often permanent.
I don't doubt that the wallet software will get better; I'm just saying that right now Bitcoin isn't ready for a lot of people and we do no long term good by pretending it is and making changes that will trick people into thinking the value is higher than it is so we can pump the price a little.

Why are you comparing uninsured Bitcoin to insured fiat currency in a bank?
At least where I live, only the first 30k per account per bank is insured, so we could compare uninsured Bitcoin to uninsured fiat, there's also no reason a company couldn't come forward to offer insurance on Bitcoin holdings.
Bitcoin can definitely be made to be more secure than it is now and be made to be way more secure than we keep our fiat now.

If you are interested in the anatomy of Bitcoin Transactions and Blocks the wiki is your best bet(I also recommend you hit Testnet) as it contains the closest thing to a protocol specification that Bitcoin has. 
You can't add things to Bitcoin the same way as you can add web pages to the internet unfortunately.
Where Bitcoin isn't quite there yet:
* Integration with existing ecommerce solutions (and EPOS systems).
* Finding places to spend it (directories exist but there is a way to go).

Open Source programmers working full time (especially 16 hour days on SOMEONE ELSE'S project) aren't working for free, there are plenty of paying jobs available in the open source arena - they either have a paying job and do the Open Source stuff on the side because they want to (not because they are hoping to be discovered - they already have a job remember) or are able to be paid from donations to the project. 
They aren't giving themselves 16 hours a day for free (how would they pay rent after sleeping the other 8 hours and having no job?!).
I'm not unaware of open source software - if you think they aren't paying their FULL TIME developers it is you who needs to talk to the Open Source Community.
This is not atypical.
Come on, said -


Like they are doing the developer a favour when a full time developer is worth far more than thousands of dollars - the OP is easily qualified for a $100k+ job if they aren't lying - they don't need to work for free, they could work 6 months and fund their own start up.
gubatron is selling working for free as a positive because the volunteer will gain "experience", even though the OP claims 15 years of experience and would be aiming for over $100k a year in the USA on the experience they *already have*.

Happy to prove your point, I'm not trying to pick a side.
Firstly - I think anyone with five minutes could probably find a few people who said those things. 
Given you didn't and haven't spent those five minutes it isn't unfair of people to ask you to, you don't need to argue about strawmen you just need to find a source.
Secondly - my point wasn't that they weren't real people it was that they were adults who made a choice. They could have demanded security or insurance or escrow but they decided not to.
They should be allowed to but the consequences should be theirs.
If BFL isn't offering refunds or guarantees or escrow you don't need to give them money at all.

Piracy is a completely seperate issue, don't get confused because they are both online.
A guy downloading game of thrones can enjoy it in his house.
A guy with Bitcoin needs to spend it somewhere to enjoy it and that's where enforcement mechanisms WILL work. You don't need to stop people getting, creating or sharing Bitcoin to legislate it, you need to control where it is spend because those companies already follow your laws and don't complain. Companies don't download Game of Thrones, they do accept Bitcoin.
Legally if the government created a black list or white list of payment addresses companies may complain about the law, they may even lobby against it, but until it was overturned they would follow it. There aren't just a few laws you could potentially apply to companies that would be followed, I've just given a few easy examples.
You can't name a single company sidestepping anything because they all comply with KYC laws. No one is sidestepping ANYTHING, it just so happens everything so far has been legal. We've been colouring within the lines this whole time.
We haven't been sidestepping, there was no laws to sidestep because the law did not anticipate Bitcoin.
Say a name. Say you believe Gyft has sidestepped the law, say you believe CheapAir has sidestepped the law, anyone. Do you have literally anyone? One company?

Before it does have an affect all the bankers will use their considerable wealth to buy in and set up companies that deal in Bitcoin, convert Bitcoin, POS for Bitcoin.... and will think it is great because it'll make the price go up, failing to realise that we aren't creating a new group of influential people (just because a few people got rich on Bitcoin early on that is not enough to form social class) we are just creating a method for the existing rich to hedge their bets and transfer their wealth over.
If Bitcoin succeeds they will be considerably more wealthy than they are now and they will still have influence.
The more money they have invested in Bitcoin the more they will use that wealth to influence change - eg: they'll use their lobbying power to have black lists and white lists enforced by law, essentially destroying other people's Bitcoin, making their own Bitcoin rarer and more valuable.
People see the decentralised nature of Bitcoin and ignore that it still has pretty narrow choke points and ignore that the people who care about having the freedom to spend are outnumbered by the people who care about the price going up because that's all we talk about any more so that's the people we've attracted.

Sure, there will be competition.
But like every angry birds there is also a hundred angry cocks that fail, even some that gain traction first.
There's a difference between competition and joining a bandwagon - prime coin is the only coin that does anything and it does so in a stupid way(and I consider it to be more a case of "rather than convince people mining isn't power wasted I'll placate them with some maths people can use") - the rest are Bitcoin plus "I'll be an early adopter if I invent a coin".
The fact that Dogecoin survived the early rounds doesn't mean anything - so did betamax.
Dogecoin is Bitcoin but cheaper, that's not enough USP long term - it made it fun to share and send to people - that'll be co-opted back into Bitcoin if it has any merit... why do you think the change to "bits" was so popular - bringing Dogecoin's success back into the fold.
There aren't many opportunities for alt coins because once they've taken the risk of seeing if an idea works, is popular and have let their users risk their money testing it, Bitcoin can steal the idea.

Rookie mistake - "This market is X Billion and if only I could capture Small Percentage I would have Many Millions". There's so many people in that hole that if it wasn't bottomless you could walk across their corpses to the other side.
A legal market has to compete against all the other legal markets, sites like the Silk Road get a larger slice of the pie because there aren't so many of them because they only have to compete with other illegal markets.
If you think you can just set up and steal X% of eBay's business then you'll have a rude awakening - the amount of money it takes to drive that kind of traffic back, the amount of development, design and research it takes to beat them at conversations, the depth of the pockets you would need to go toe to toe with their advertising budget (hint - of that huge percentage you mentioned, a huge majority couldn't give a shit about Bitcoin or openness, you wouldn't convert them to your site for free by default, they'd stay with eBay *by choice*) is beyond most startups without huge VC backing.

I'm not sure why it is the opposite curve from the one you were expecting.
Whenever there are huge monetary rewards the barrier to entry increases with the money.

It is a shame that the barrier to entry has gone up but it was inevitable.

We need an actually worthless currency that is functionally the same as Bitcoin but worthless so people can fuck with it instead.
Not testnet - because developers need those Bitcoin.
Dogecoin was supposed to fill the void but people started getting greedy and trying to get Dogecoin added to sites as payment options and added to exchanges, then they got super greedy and wanted to change the pow and join up with Litecoin.
We need a few fake sites with a cryptocurrency that is supposed to be worthless so people can practice without needing real money.
It wouldn't take long to create WorthlessCoin and a few webstores that accepted payments in it, sent receipts out and had no real products and a disclaimer saying the site and the currency were for testing purposes only.
Maybe DemoCoin is better than WorthlessCoin...
With a few sites:
* DemoExchange
* DemoStore
* DemoTicketsOnline
* DemoPaperWallet
* etc
You could give people a functional tour of Bitcoin without encouraging them to beg for Bitcoin in so that they can see how good the technology is with 0 risk, 0 investment and 0 begging.
The people we should be selling the idea of Bitcoin too aren't the people who will be so impressed by 20 cents that they will throw their life savings into Bitcoin, they are the people who will actually consider Bitcoin's potential, look at the security options and be happier and safer using it.

Completely separate.
There's no reason to mine votes because votes aren't money - we can create them under different conditions because if I'm running a D&amp;D club I should be able to allow my members to vote, I shouldn't have to source pre-mined votes then distribute them(if I did they would have a supply and a demand and that means they would have a value and this is awful for fair elections and voting), I should just be able to create them without external influence or having to find existing votes to use and no one else should care because me creating those votes shouldn't allow someone else to use them for a completely unrelated purpose like a presidential election. Since votes I create for my own election can only be used in that election there's no reason I should have to use premined votes that already exist instead of creating my own.
There's no reason to use that paradigm at all except it requires changing less of Bitcoin's code to do it and it has lots of negatives to boot.
If there was to be any mining it should be a parallel currency that doesn't influence votes but does pay the people mining for their efforts - but premining is a whole other thing because now there exists a bunch of votes and a method of distributing them and I'm not sold.
That is - the network may produce an alt coin but the coin itself would be used for trading and never for casting a vote so the coin can have value while votes do not.
If you make the coin and the vote the same thing then you can't reward miners unless you give a value to the votes and if you give a value to the votes you are creating Cthulhu.
You have to trust votes are given out, you have to keep your eye on a bunch of extra votes that exist for no reason and you create a limited amount of something in a place it shouldn't be limited.
Votes aren't given to you, the right to vote is something you always have - what you are given is permission for that vote to be counted towards an official total, not the vote itself.
The right to have a say isn't bestowed upon you or distributed - free speech is intrinsic.

I'll tell you right away - it is possible to detect locations, it is equally possible to fake them. You can code away the people too lazy to fake their location, you can in no way prevent determined people from doing it.
So, so far we have a feature list of 1 feature that isn't 100% doable. If your only request is not possible, that would be why there is no app. You aren't asking for anything except the one thing you can never have.
I had a look to see what would be required to physically build it (I'm a developer) over the weekend and have my own list of features but without interest from people saying they want it and specific things they want (so far we have one thing and you can't have it!) so I know I'm not barking up the wrong tree I wouldn't want to waste my time with it further.
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:55:58
You don't get a fix - everyone knew what Bitcoin was going in, how many there would be, how they would be generated, all of it, up front. It would be disastrous to Bitcoin's value if any of that changed because it means any of it could - if it can change you can't believe your Bitcoin is 1 of 21 million because next year there could be 42 million.
If something is wrong, an alt coin will fix it.
Either the alt coin will take over or, if the fix is worthy, once the alt coin has proven it works and is secure, Bitcoin would adopt those changes but right now, no one should be proposing major changes.
Remember the golden rule - don't put in more than you can afford to lose.

Mine is that while it *can* be a killer feature for a currency, given both ebay and Amazon allow normal people to become sellers, a lot of people already see those as being quite decentralised.
Not enough to satisfy mine (or your I imagine) definition of the word but enough to satisfy them.
Before Bitcoin you could not point to money that was "decentralised enough" for most people. It was a UNIQUE Selling Point because it was UNIQUE, not just ODD, it wasn't MORE decentralised than eBay, which is what your site would be, it was the only thing that could claim any element of decentralisation.
That's a far bigger development than what you propose - You are comparing the invention of the car to the creation of the Ford Focus MK III.

I'm not a worrier, I'm a code monkey who likes details - Bitcoin's potential is particularly fun to speculate on but sometimes you have to know which ideas to drop and which to work on.
It is very clear to me that you are a dreamer, you are asking for purple elephants - things that only make sense if you don't get too familiar with the details.
You know, there are banks running decades old code to avoid the risk of change? You couldn't sell this to then if it came with handjobs from the queen.

It is far better we verify each other out in the open, where we can see 0% of people cheated instead of bickering over whether it was 1% or 2% that cheated.
If 1% is possible someone will build a 99% machine.
Why is it so important technology solves this problem? 
You said it needs to be a technological solution but you didn't account for why? 
As a programmer I really, *really*, *really* wanted to come up with a technological solution because it would have been a massive achievement but in lieu of a technical solution everything works with a social one, and it means we can do it now.
You could always change to a technical solution later, but at this stage you may be waiting decades or forever before you can precede.

I know of them because they are local, GoCityHotels.com is a new website but the company that owns it has other domains and a physical location, I got an email because I've used them before  - the "view in web" link on it points here - 
The StackOverflow post  doesn't look like it was made by the same guy who wrote the email I received - they're a very different coding style(note the lack of hyphens in class names, StackOverflow post has multiple HTML Elements per line, email I received has every element indented, even link tags - no lines with multiple elements at all excluding line breaks). I'd be willing to bet those were made by two different people - code is like... a person's voice. It sounds different.
The email is dated April 14th - it opens:

I've always said the problem with alt coins is that because they are mostly the Bitcoin code + tweaks any alt coin that seriously took off would have whatever it did well re-integrated into Bitcoin and it would lose its competitive advantage.
Luckily Dogecoin's real advantage isn't in having lots of numbers - its that the community is still cheerful, welcoming, helpful and charitable - I don't see that being put into the Bitcoin code or community any time soon.

Unfortunately there are too many mixed truths in this for me to untangle it all - you mix the absolute testable truths of the digital world with cultural truths that cannot be tested or defined digitally and try to use them both together to form a joint truth and it doesn't work. You go from something culturally assumed to something definite, Eg:


You can't programmatically verify someone is a Sheik without a central authority who verifies users' Sheik-y-ness.


You are - your compensation is the search service Google provides. That may not be the type of compensation you want but it is compensation - that is what you get from the deal.


Pay Per Click does mother fucking horribly - if you remember the pre-google days of the web you will remember that the reason people think of it as it is today at all is because of the work Google did in cleaning it up and removing viagra ads.
The only thing not doing a bad job is Google and I think anyone wanting to topple them must first acknowledge what they do right and not downplay it to make the alternative sound grander.


I completely disagree - it makes all the difference - we can't cash in that potential, we have to live with what we have today and today we don't have a solution to the microtransaction problem.
I think we will eventually solve global warming and world hunger - I haven't build a company that relies upon global warming and world hunger being solved and if I proposed one before those solutions were found I would understand why I wasn't being taken seriously.
That we might eventually solve the microtransaction issue means that AFTER that happens your idea has a chance - it means BEFORE that happens(NOW) your idea is unworkable.


Indeed not - Google is good, Google is established, Google is well funded, well connected and has a bunch of smart people working on AdWords - you compete with Google like a sling shot competes with a tank.
David and Goliath is an interesting story because 99 times of out 100 Goliath would crush David.
Look at how many and how frequently Google buy's startups and you will see that Google is like a fat kid in a cake store and all those tiny companies end with an OM NOM NOM.


Google handles a lot more - it has a search engine with a high enough volume of traffic and GOOD results to attract users, they handle arbitration and fraud detection (and resolution - you CANNOT do this the way you propose because there are NO chargebacks in Bitcoin - you pay someone buy accident and that's just TOUGH).
Google does a lot - their success is in making people think what they do is trivial, that it is a simple process that only takes a few clicks - their interface is not a minor issue. The work they put into refining the process is not a minor issue.
Bitcoin by itself allows you to deal with money in a decentralised fashion but you are leaps and bounds away from being able to describe something workable, much further away from something usable and an unfathomable distance away from being able to promote and market it.
Look - I'm not saying you can't or won't succeed (or that you shouldn't) but you aren't even halfway there yet.
I realise that for most people, liking something means offering blind support and the fact that I've been fairly negative makes it seem like I'm against the idea but I'm not, I'm for the idea - it is just not there yet.


To bring it all back around:
* The general idea is possible but possible:
 * not done quite like you want to be done.
 * it would take a lot more work than is apparent from reading your posts.
 * we are missing a few key pieces of technology - to avoid failure a lot of extras would need to be developed.
 * your solution is incomplete
 * "use Bitcoin for the money" is far from being a solution itself, there are no good or secure ways to allow the decentralised spending/allocating/moving of funds that cannot be manipulated. You have to stop nodes colluding to payout funds they shouldn't - otherwise what you get is a new authority that oversees Bitcoin.
Right now, you have no workable idea that would make this decentralised.


Doesn't mean you've built it or even that it can be built (though in this case, I believe it can - though no one has succeeded yet). There are no "P2P payments" in Bitcoin. You would need to create them.
It has all the practical value of "build another Google, how hard can it be, it only searches for words in webpages - you are a programmer, right?".
Just because the Blockchain is decentralised doesn't mean it provides a decentralised way of managing funds out of the box - it most certainly does not.
I love what you've done and the insights you've put together to get things to this stage and it has been a fun conversation but unless you are willing to sink a substantial amount of time into this it won't take off.
It has potential but it is a long way from being a workable idea and as it is now it is a few working pieces of technology stitched together with wishful thinking - when it came to write code, that wishful thinking would have to remain as wishful thinking, it wouldn't become an actual solution.
I think if you put the time in you may have been able to take it beyond that but since you've already said you aren't going to then it is dead in the water - your idea relies on technology that doesn't exist and that you aren't going to build in the end I have to say it won't work.
Given time I anticipate some of your problems will be solved anyway - the bloat of microtransactions will be solved because that is good for everyone, P2P fund manipulation has other uses too - that will make the barrier to entry to create this much much lower, but right now - great idea, great sales pitch but no execution and that means there's only so much to be excited about.
It's fanfiction with plot holes right now, as a practical person who likes writing code, that's a deal breaker.
I would love to work on this, I'd love to see you work on this, but what you have right now is an almost idea - I quote people on developing their almost ideas every day and most of the time nothing comes of it because they think if it takes 10 minutes to explain it should take 10 minutes to code and as a result they've budgeted 10 minutes to pay me - people don't understand that it only takes less than a half dozen worlds to ask for everything.
TL;DR - Easier said than done to the point where it isn't being done. I like the idea (though it isn't quite the first idea of this nature) but the reason it doesn't exist already is because the barrier to entry is higher than you've placed it.
I realise you aren't planning on actually making it so nothing I've said should come as too much of a blow and I do think you have the beginnings of something, I just think you underestimate how far your idea is from a solution.

Sure - but that one Blockchain does NOT have to be Bitcoin.
It wouldn't be easy to kill Bitcoin, I don't think a government or company could shut it down - but I think the community could well be persuaded if there was something worth more.
@_date: 2014-06-07 20:57:19
It does highlight what could be interpreted as a weakness in the community but remember the size of the community.
Just because a lot of people who've posted care about the price a lot it doesn't mean that a majority of people interested in Bitcoin care more about the price.
Much more likely that someone likely to return to the price several times a day is also likely to check reddit frequently.
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:21:20
I think the drop off rate is in the high 80% to 90% range (from my memory of other posts) - the great thing about Bitcoin is that the cost of continuing to accept it is so low that even if you only get 10% of the initial surge that's still enough incentive to continue to do so.
Compared to the 3% credit card companies take it is a no brainer.
I don't think it is deceptive joining together as a community to ask a site to accept Bitcoin as long as we do use them. I don't want to see Bitcoin logos everywhere for the sake of it - I want to use what I have!
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:21:01
Certainly COULD, but will a significant number bother? The less people willing to accept tainted Bitcoin the less tainted Bitcoin will be worth than untainted Bitcoin, the more countries that share a common blacklist the lower it will be worth, the higher the risk of being caught, the less it will be worth.
I for one will be sticking to the Bitcoin that is worth most and can be spent the most freely.
The more momentum legislation gains the more likely Switzerland would be to join the Blacklist and render those traded Bitcoin worthless or worth less.
If the Swiss participant trades those Bitcoin for something that can be tied to his real life identity they could still claim he committed a crime and try to get him exported to the USA - they have an extradition treaty with Switzerland.
Don't think America can and would try that for a crime not committed on their soil? Think again. They've tried it before, look up Gary McKinnon. Even when it fails it is still more than a minor inconvenience for those involved; people will want to avoid that.
 
While some people will try and profit from trading blacklisted Bitcoin, there will be a difference in the value of blacklisted Bitcoin and non-blacklisted Bitcoin due to the decreased utility and increased risk. That shrinks the market, reduces the demand - it doesn't need to go away completely to make a significant difference. 
My point isn't that governments can magic shit away - the OP asked if his Bitcoins would be damaged and the answer is yes - their value could potentially go down because Bitcoin on the blacklist will be worth less - otherwise, what would be the motivation for people with whitelisted Bitcoin be to trade? The only motive is that the guy in Switzerland you mentioned (who already has Bitcoin so has no motive to trade for Bitcoin of the same value) has is that he will get more Blacklist Bitcoin than he had Whitelist Bitcoin.
The answer to the OP's question is that if legislation passed AND his Bitcoin came under that legislation, his Bitcoin would be worth less than Bitcoin not covered by the legislation. Sure, he might still be able to trade it, but he'll be trading it for less.
That's all.

Is that to say - your system doesn't protect them, they'll want to protect themselves in the traditional fashion? 
That's to be expected at some point along the chain.
It is either that or someone with tokens in the network escrows them for the 30 or so.days it takes for traditional banking payments to 'finalise'.
This was always going to be a problem for Bitcoin adoption - once traditional banks increase their security they'll be less inclined to reverse transactions as they'll have used 2 factor auth on bank hardware.

I don't see what natural law you reference when you say that one of them *should* be showing signs of challenging Bitcoin. There's no reason why Bitcoin should be showing signs of being overthrown so early on.
Bitcoin's replacement will be created as the result of a significant eureka moment - there won't be signs, no one will have had a given idea, then, someone will have it. There won't be signs of someone having an idea before they implement or share it with the rest of us.

That's all good when the money can be put to work properly, when all the risks have been assessed and when you can leave it all to people with thirty years experience.
Less good when you give a bunch of money to people who think their job is to spend it, who've never managed a company - they will make every mistake it is possible to make.
People who have the experience in the places we need, when we stop rushing adoption to a point where it outstrips spending and infrastructure we mostly need code, realise they don't need investment because they can build it themselves and own all of it.
Beware coders with unfinished projects who give ownership away - they either don't know business and you don't want them managing your money or they need the money to finish the code.

A drug dealer who needs to ask for free money needs to go fuck themselves - at best you are a shitty drug dealer - if you sell drugs and have to beg online for free shit you need to re-evaluate. I also hope it is legal where you live and you took steps to hide your real life identity when you confessed.
You also get extra shitty points for admitting you are a drug dealer - loose lips sink ships - you sold yourself out to gain back some pride. You might want to practice not telling people. I sure hope none of your customers were expecting you wouldn't sell them out to sound cool or avoid the consequences of your own incompetence.
I'm not butt hurt, just telling you how it is quickly, going on my way and forgetting you exist.
You are a jealous fool looking at the big dogs and wondering how hard you have to beg to get a taste of their bone, here's a hint: If you are asking you aren't worthy, you are just a little fish sticking their neck out to far and like every other little fish who's too stupid to realise why they don't deserve free money who thinks they'll make it as a drug dealer, you'll get yourself caught trying to be more than you are.
You are just a waste of everyone else's time, pay your dues small time.


I'm not mad, I don't need to be civil - you ask for that which you haven't earned, but far worse - you realise you haven't earned it and still want everyone else to put in the leg work for you and tell you where free money is at. You are getting the response you need, not the response you want.

You **do know** he wants to be left alone.
There is no ambiguity there.
It was stated in no uncertain terms.


Sounds like a reliable source! (By which I mean a completely useless source that you would have to want very strongly to believe before you would even consider it credible)
You have one confirmed statement - that he wants to be left alone.
Anything else is speculation that can be avoided by accepting that he asked to be left alone and not continuing to talk about hypotheticals because there is uncertainty there as a result of us not knowing him personally.
It certainly feels like you want it to be "maybe" okay to send him things - if you want to be seen as someone who doesn't have an agenda stop suggesting it may be okay to invade this person's life.
Given all you've posted is things supporting the "it may be okay" argument it is hard not to assume you are taking that position.
We know enough to know he wants left the fuck alone, he said as much himself.
I can't imagine he would consider anyone who would bother him at home his friend and I don't believe anyone who truly wanted to show support would do hassle him so blatantly and knowingly.

We don't need a consensus - every client can have its own options and own defaults. Eventually some people will choose one way, some people will chose the other and it won't really bother anyone because if I ask you for an amount as a fraction of a Bitcoin your client will display the amount in bits if that is what you've asked it to do.


If the problem was the size of the userbase why would you condone  statement (which is the one I replied to) - the psychological effect they were talking about is more people buying in earlier and the userbase growing quicker. 
If your argument was that while we sort out the details a smaller userbase is preferable then we shouldn't be doing things just because they'll grow the userbase, we should be using this time to sort out all the details while there as little of us as there will ever be during the development stage.
The "bits" argument is irrelevant as far as future proofing goes because it isn't something that happens in the blockchain at all - it happens on every client and every merchant point of contact separately.

Hasn't returned it yet, but he could empty the wallet and return the bit of paper and no one could prove the original wallet owner didn't do it - why wouldn't he return it once the parents contact the school? 
A slight step down from '= his ass in prison' but now we are on the same page.
It isn't about the amount of power, having any is enough to get you a leg up.
He didn't mug the OP.
He said 'you need to give me that' and the OP did.
It doesn't matter how power works on paper, that's how it works in practice.
He isn't going to jail because he didn't mug the OP and because there is no evidence he took it so he could own or spend it. If all he did was sit on it, he's in the clear.
As the OP traded private keys, a giant Bitcoin no no, there's no way to prove it wasn't reclaimed by the original owner if the Bitcoin is moved.
Reasonable doubt means the school is never on the hook for this - if the police aren't going to press charges there's no bonus to involving them - just have the parents call the school.

"It can be done via markets" - therefore this shortcut, while great from them, should be considered business as usual by you who are already being screwed by them now, albeit in a less efficient manner?
Just because the have a mechanism of influence now doesn't mean I would give them a better one without considering the cost to me.
Let me reitterate - I don't want to stabalise the price.
It goes up and down because new money doesn't know how to handle it and they throw their Bitcoin around - investing in Neo and Bee and a hundred other failed ideas and obvious scams and because people are trying to use Bitcoin like a stock and want to day trade it despite 0 experience trading anything other than Pokémon cards.
I have no interest in helping them.
I'm going to let all the people making stupid decisions lose their wealth naturally as the price fluctuates and drags them under - once they are gone the market will stabilise in their absence though I believe it fluctuates because it is small relative to other markets and that means they can exert a greater amount of influence over it than they could equal sized markets.
As Bitcoin grows their influence will fall away anyway; I don't need to do anything except wait them out.
There's nothing in your idea for me - it will make development harder (which means it'll create more MtGox's, which means it'll hurt the price even if you could stabilise it) and in return I get no more back.
I like that you care enough to journey outside the box, but if there's no practical hope of it being implemented it doesn't get beyond a fun conversation

I don't centre it around the price of Bitcoin because I want to encourage my friends to spend what they can afford to in the hopes they might use it, not to speculate on the price.
Otherwise they get into it with a view to making a profit and that makes them put in far more than they can afford to because they think it is coming back and there's no guarantees.

Fake web content isn't a ghost or vampire, it shows up on film and using the method I mentioned above it would be live text and look and work like normal content except for the encoding errors you got by typing ' directly instead of "&amp;_lsquo;". 
Those appear as ? in that section of the message because you added that text to to the real message you got telling you not to sell cryptocurrencies.
This doesn't add anything to the conversation because it is still just you saying it, it just does how much free time you have and how much people want to believe.
You haven't proven it isn't fake, if your post update saying you know how to fake content but you wasn't a complete lie then you know that this doesn't prove anything so why are you still bothering?

I didn't say you personally were, that was never my point.
My point was that this benefits mostly people wanting to cash in on the Bitcoin's price and does nothing for Bitcoin or the people using it long term.
You get 1 pat on the back for being a good guy, but we are talking money here, most of the people proposing "bits" don't need a pat on the back, they need a stop and frisk because their motives are suspect.
"Bits" is shitty yet it is getting far more support than it should be, despite mBTC and uBTC never gaining significant traction despite being better ideas.
I see a shitty idea with support that can't be completely accounted for by the well meaning and I see someone with money to gain.
In Bitcoin, you don't need to go far to see there's money in it for someone.

You literally right click the text, open inspector, double click it and add your junk text.
Given a real announcement from eBay would likely increase the price I don't see why you believe this is too much work - the OP's post history and the screenshot itself proves the OP sells cryptocurrencies, they wouldn't just get lulz, they'd get money.
The OP is the kind of person to create an ebay listing for £1 of Kanyecoin - I think you overestimate how much they value their time.
Truth is first line support will probably hear about it AFTER us, they certainly wouldn't be announcing it in a warning to the OP.
Why would the OP be telling us when it would be good press for eBay - they wouldn't do this and not make a big deal about getting us to pat them on the back.
If First Line Support knew everyone else who worked at eBay would know and it would have been leaked.

You are right, there are new technologies needed but there are also technologies pending such as pruning.
Once the main client implements pruning they will be able to revisit the block size limit.
Maybe we get lucky and can go with 10mb blocks - ten times what it is now.
You are right to see the problem but do you have any reason to believe it can't be solved? 
Combine the money involved with Bitcoin and press attention Bitcoin is getting together with the type of problem we have here and you end up with a challenge that could make a programmer's career - give it a while and everyone will be taking their best swing at this.

It doesn't matter what people feel, it matters what they can prove.
People *felt* Neo &amp; Bee would succeed - but they didn't ask for a business plan.
People *felt* Mt Gox was solvent - but they didn't ask for proof.
It's never enough to feel. Since the license is the only valuable part of Mt Gox left, and since those are harder to come by than code, there's no reason a community owned exchange shouldn't be run on Open Source code.
The code isn't the barrier to entry, legal restrictions, banking restrictions and trust are.

It wouldn't be worth anything but just as a computer file it would work.
Bitcoin doesn't stop you making double spends, clients just recognises them as such - if it wanted to record them (or if they were videos the user wanted to see) they could.
I'm building a client that accepts double spends and invalid blogs for logging / auditing. They are still there, your client is just smart enough not to count them towards your balance and miners don't put them in blocks.

It isn't called stalking to click a link that appears in my inbox every time you reply(even if it was, would you think the people who'd actually arrest you are going to feel too guilty to read the things you posted in public because you might *accuse* them of stalking you?); while I don't like beggers, especially beggers who should be able to afford not to beg - I also feel sorry for young tools who put themselves in a position of vulnerability especially since I personally believe the war on drugs when applied to weed is completely bullshit; you'd do well to take my advice, you'd be less exposed with your dick out in the local park.
It isn't my job to arrest you or find out who you really are; as already mentioned I'd turn a blind eye to weed... but I do work in IT, I do see how close to the edge you've actually gone - like a Looney Toons character you've actually gone over the edge; I'm just waiting for you to look down.

Even if we could, we should not.
Bitcoin transactions are final.
Not "final if everything went okay and no one is upset or out of pocket".
This is going to drive home code hygiene, rigorous testing, open accounting, provable holdings and a bunch of other stuff that, while they won't be any comfort to you, will make the next generation stronger than this one.
I hope one of them is documentation - Bitcoin is sorely lacking in that area and the Wiki is not sufficient for operating at the level Bitcoin operates at right now.

Ultimately your post revolves around a single premise - that the USA will stand alone with these measures and they won't spread. When the home of the NSYE becomes the largest home of Bitcoin financial services other people will follow those rules for their own convenience.
The people opening these large companies by definition will be the super rich; the things that put you off don't even make their radar and they will use that money and power to leverage INFLUENCE, especially when they stand to make a profit.
The KYC stuff is a ball ache in normal currencies, they deal with it by having roughly similar rules everywhere.
You think the American government can bug the German Chancellor's phone but can't get some "me too's" on some laws that will be good for the governments of lots of countries? You think there are many countries that want to lose control over inflation and the creation of currency?
You kill something and people turn up to the funeral asking about the cause of death - they will Weekend At Bernies this thing.
There will be a currency, it will be called Bitcoin, it will be completely incompatible with the founding principles of what you call Bitcoin today - it'll just be another currency under someone's control that isn't yours.
This is it - The Governments VS the Governed.
Not a specific government versus their own people, but all governments and all people - they aren't going to create competitive advantages in other countries except in instances where it won't cause a really significant mass exodus. Token differences.
They are going to cooperate with each other because Bitcoin is the start of the end for them; as soon as we do one thing well without them we'll start trying to do more and more until we don't need them. If they haven't acted to corrupt the ideals of Bitcoin yet it is because they have not fully understood it, once they do they will not play nicely.

If you want to let people know what r/Bitcoin is all about we should sticky a 'hodl' or 'to the moon' post dependant on the price and lock the subreddit so no more posts are made.
r/Bitcoin's practical contribution to Bitcoin decreases with time, it is worth sticking around for the occasional gem but I wouldn't take it too seriously.
We started out as a community who saw Bitcoin's potential before you could spend it anywhere and before it was really worth anything and we worked on adding value and functionality because it would make the world better.
Now it is worth something we are a community of amateur investors and people who've come into a lot of money who only think about keeping the value up so their new wealth doesn't vanish. People with no interest in developing Bitcoin because they already made the money they wanted to.
It took a white paper and hundreds of blocks to prove	Bitcoin worked as an idea to the people who started r/Bitcoin.
It only took an open hand for Neo &amp; Bee to get cash from the people who make up r/Bitcoin now.

That doesn't mean that it is normal for this to happen - if anything, miners are slightly ahead of schedule and the average block is found SOONER than 10 minutes after the previous one.
Visa has had entire DAYS when their network was down and it happens to banks too - 
RBS was dead on Cyber Monday for god sakes - there was hundreds of people abandoning carts in supermarkets because they couldn't pay with their cards - 
Waiting 45 minutes this one time because the merchant you chose freely requires 3 confirmations is not a huge Bitcoin issue compared to banking as a whole.

If the small amount proves the large amount was compromised then both will get stolen.
If the small amount isn't linked to the large amount and is stored somewhere else and doesn't represent the large amount you may as well store the small amount with the large amount and all your money will be safe. It also doesn't prove anything.

The nonce can be ANY number from ANYWHERE - you are right.
The problem is that it is not.
This is not the only potential pitfall - it is only one that has been seen in the wild and actively exploited and I thought that would have been enough to show you that generating the key securely isn't enough, you have to be able to use it securely.
You could use roll a dice to generate your own nonce but no wallets currently support custom nonces and the nonce needs to be secret - you can't do it in front of people so it wouldn't work for in person transactions.
This is just the tip so to speak - you aren't trying to defeat the problems I have found, you are up against people far smarter, better funded and with more experience who have been clever enough to stay under the radar.
I may be a developer but I'm only one developer, even if you win an argument with me that doesn't make the danger any less real because I don't have any of the things the NSA has nor do I dedicate time to backdooring, creating and breaking cryptography.

It isn't an innovation to have such a low valued currency people throw it around - I've said it before and I'll say it again - Dogecoin's real USP was the people and the enthusiasm, and it has lasted until now because that part can't just be copied over from a Git repo but that only lasts so long - long term Dogecoin needs a differentiator other than its low value and people insisting it is "fun" long past the point it stopped being fun.
The community will implode and splinter off eventually, since Dogecoin's only differentiators are social it is a matter of time - you can't have a currency who's value is backed by community spirit - at best that spirit will be borrowed by people looking to get rich. There's a reason Dogecoin has to sponsor things - if they didn't pay to get people interested it would implode. Dogecoiners don't have faith in Dogecoin seeing natural growth against Bitcoin and Litecoin, they are always on the push and I don't blame them - that's the smart move if you are in their position.
AND if they ever succeeded in making it worth something people are going to forget to be generous and they will be down their differentiator. When you play pass the parcel and the music stops, you get to unwrap what you've won. That's the alt coin game.
I'm happy to admit Bitcoin will steal successful features from alt coins because  I'm not the one doing the stealing, I'm just an observer saying what I see and what I expect. It is not me doing the stealing, why wouldn't I point it out?
Besides, again, Bitcoin is only reclaiming code that was taken from Bitcoin.
Dogecoin doesn't suck - it isn't different enough from Bitcoin on a technical level to say its anything other than Bitcoin with a bad mascot and no value, at best it is a long term "meh". For it to suck it Dogecoin would have to have attempted to innovate and failed, to deserve "suck" it would need to be different.

I see things the other way around - Bitcoin needs to be decentralised and given that the Bitcoin Foundation has more than their fair share collectively regarding how the code changes  we need to balance that and make sure we all get to be counted - otherwise there will be changes that benefit them and not us, likely at the expense of us.
The Bitcoin Foundation should be by us, for us and therefore it should include all of us - just now you are treating them like some sort of *authority*, I find the idea of an authority distasteful but if other people want one then I want one that represents me, not just a collection of some people who happened to be in the right place early on who are going to hold on to their position tooth and nail while using it to directly benefit themselves personally.
Why would I want that?

If all you own of a given currency is $0.20 then that currency is pretty useless to you until you acquire more and if someone gave me $0.20 free just so I'd buy more I'd right it off - if someone who had invested in beanie babies gave you $0.20 of beanie babies you wouldn't buy more beanie babies so you could claim to have a collection; $0.20 is far below a useful amount where tipping makes sense as a tool to advertise and draw in new users - sure, giving it to people on who likely have more so it adds to their wealth is fine, but that's not what this thread is about.
This thread is about educating people unfamiliar with Bitcoin, who have no use for $0.20 in Bitcoin. Even if they were to buy their own, even if they only got $10 worth that would make the $0.20 pretty insignificant and giving it out so you can pat yourself on the back and pretend you are driving the price up is humorous at best.

As the person who paid you still has access to THEIR Bitcoin(sorry, blockchain was never updated to say it was yours) have them transfer it to an address you do own.

Exactly "in the last two days" - you think they won't converge over decades because they made a token gesture of disagrement on a separate issue on Tuesday?
This is money and control over the creation of money, they'll put aside their differences there because if they don't they'll lose their power to give themselves money by diluting money they already promised you the value of.
It doesn't need to be the WHOLE rest of the world, just a good number of places. Laws don't need to be identical, just similar.
They don't even need to be the exact same laws to be compatible - there just needs to be legal islands that inhibit the completely free transfer of money. Since they don't need to be exactly the same laws it won't even look like countries are cooperating with each other, it'll look like they are independently trying to protect their own interests.
"Oh, we're regulating this because of Mt Gox, we'll save you losing millions, promise..." 
You have to remember - you kill the IDEALS of Bitcoin, you leave Bitcoin standing and no one knows anything happened - we aren't talking about ending Bitcoin and leaving a void, we are talking about perverting it, stringing it up and showing people it's still "fine". You have to leave people something to point at so they won't be suspicious.
It won't even look like violence.
They'll just make the laws so strict that only the existing rich (so, we're talking like 10 people from our community + everyone who got rich under the existing system) are able to achieve compliance and we'll end up with gateways run, monitored and controlled by the status quo.
It'll have all the faces of Bitcoin, we'll just be priced out of using it to influence significant change because all your Bitcoin will be tied to you and you won't be able to spend it to influence change the government isn't happy with without them knowing.
It'll be just enough there are people still happy with Bitcoin. If it happens slowly enough people won't care because Bitcoin will still be worth money. Ideals will be bought and compromised in that manner. You'll never feel like you've lost freedom, there will just be one company changing their rules here, a country changing a small law there... and it'll add up.

It kinda is and kinda isn't, what I mean is - the decimal places is FRONT END ONLY - balances are **never** stored as decimals.
They are **never** coded as decimals.
The don't exist in transactions as decimals.
They don't exist in the blockchain ANYWHERE as decimals.
Balances are always stored as a whole number of Satoshis - NEVER as a decimal.
The idea that decimals are "for programmers", is wrong. They are for users - only users see them. The code does everything in Satoshis.
I didn't say a programmer didn't do it, I specifically disagree that the decimals are "for programmers" - no more, no less.
That's one of the reason it is so difficult to change from 8 places, if it was a decimal we could just add another decimal place - since things are already stored as whole numbers of Satoshi's, to add more "decimals" means changing the way numbers are stored behind the scenes.
If you have 1 satoshi it is stored as "1" not "0.00000001".
1 Bitcoin is stored as "100000000".
Code never sees decimal places.
With that in mind, adding an "extra decimal place" is hard because half a satoshi wouldn't be "0.000000005", or "1.5", as clients currently store whole numbers of satoshis and probably aren't set up to handle fractional satoshis (and the transactions themselves only ever refer to satoshis not whole Bitcoin) it is more hassle than you'd think.

No one made that argument but I'm glad you so handily defeated it.
My argument isn't that we should keep Bitcoin in beta forever, just that while it is actually beta software we should continue to call it that and once it leaves beta because it *merits* leaving beta we can start marketing it.
Why raise awareness of something most people shouldn't be using yet, why not wait until it is at least most of the things it could and should be before trying to sell it to people.

AND makes Bitcoin user friendly, there's no reason to pick "bits", a word that exist in the field Bitcoin occupies(hell, Bitcoin was literally NAMED AFTER "bits"), when we can pick another that would also have the benefit of being less shitty and generic.
Might as well call it "stuff" or "things" as "bits".

There is no backwards relation between public keys and private keys.
You would just be checking every private key possible, the sun would burn out before you succeeded and you are more likely to find someone else's key first because there is more money belonging to other people than to the OP.
'Mining' private keys - generating them over and over to see if you can create one with funds already is the best you could do, you couldn't specifically target your funds OP and even if you tried you aren't likely to ever find one private key that belongs to someone else and has Bitcoin.
Isn't even worth trying or Bitcoin would be worthless the moment mining private keys became more profitable than actual mining.

My main point was that I liked the dice rolls because at a hardware level you can never be sure it really is random - especially for larger organisations that are using 1 donation address there is a real risk they could use the same nonce twice - a dice rolled nonce between moving funds out of the main wallet into an every day spending one would be a worth while precaution for them because they stick to a single address - the nonce is the only thing protecting their funds.
It would be a worthwhile feature for them to be able to use a dice roll for the nonce.
Now the bug is known there are programs actively searching for duplicate nonces even if you weren't worried about the NSA as the Android Bug pointed out, problems with the random generator come up.

There's some truth in there somewhere. Long term Bitcoin has a future because it has a use and people that use it - I'll still be in if Bitcoin goes back to $1 because there are places it works better than anything else now. Plus, now that governments are planning to tax it there will be some legitimacy. I'm not unique so there will be other people with me there at the bottom. Bitcoin won't die.
Short term - a lot of people got in because of the price. That's the reason a price ticker made off with so much money, because people were hyper focused on the immediate value of Bitcoin. 
They told other people how rich they were getting and they got in for the same reason. All the articles about all the big car and house purchases.
Since there is a limited pool of people who will get into something because they think they can buy it low and sell it high - seriously, most people don't want to - the growth stalled and they all left.
The pool of people willing to use a proven payment technology to buy stuff is much higher, Bitcoin just needs some age behind it.
Bitcoin is here to stay, but you can't expect upvotes when so many people here invested money they shouldn't have and gambling on making a lot quickly.

We aren't talking about marketing we are talking about positions of power, the people able to make decisions and shape the future - right now, the Bitcoin Foundation is a bunch of white guys.
If you want to compare that to America we can look how terribly America treated other races when shit was run that way - the natives provided the land for the Chinese to build the railway so slaves could tend the fields.
Remember when the drug war was telling you marijuana cigerattes would make white women sleep with black guys?
Hell, now its mostly male you have politicians that think vaginas can "shut down" when they are "legitimately raped". That idea got serious support and air time.. not 100 years ago, 1 year ago.
It isn't just racial groups that need representation - clearly without representation, women are at a disadvantage because there are some old guys making laws about their vaginas even though they haven't a fucking clue how they work.
You show no understanding of how bad things were and how far America has come, but at least you care about marketing dollars even if no one said "represented in the marketing" - the Bitcoin Foundation is hardly a MARKETING organisation.

I already posted how I would make sure hosts kept files - it is in this thread.
So they waste a while sending you garbage and they get a relatively tiny payment as a reward - Because the garbage was signed by them you broadcast it with the key as proof and a warning and they get less than ten cents.
There are always opportunities for cheats - a clean reputation has to pay and it has to be possible to prove cheating after the fact even if the first victim loses one micro payment.
You can make it so reputation is part of the network structure - it is fairly easy to prove you didn't receive the file you requested from the host if you have a junk file signed by them - maybe the network should count that as one refund.
Your file should be signed by you.
Their file should be your file and the signature, signed by themselves and hashed.
The payment should specify the hash of the file you are purchasing the key for.
If you pay them and the file is junk, you publish it and the network verifies that they signed it yet it does not decrypt to a file signed by you and the transaction is reversed and a public note of the attempt is made.

If it takes a few years for Satoshis to have value maybe IT IS OKAY if people wait that long to buy into Bitcoin.
I want Bitcoin to catch on as as much as anyone but I don't think there's something wrong if everyone isn't signing up TODAY.
There is still a lot of work to be done building clients and infrastructure - private buyer protection, trusted, brick and mortar escrow, transaction insurance so you can accept 0 confirmations in your shop without accepting the risk.
Bitcoin as it exists today is very new software and is very ill suited for the majority of people and given the age of Bitcoin THAT IS OKAY.
People who want to see adoption TODAY have Bitcoin on an exchange to sell; I just want people to remember that, to remember that it is okay to build Bitcoin slowly and that it WILL take YEARS before we are ready for everyone to use it and that the things that are wrong with it right now aren't permanent and we can fix them gradually.
We couldn't even handle the number of transactions if 10% of people started using it today - why are people bitching about mass adoption like we need it right not or else Bitcoin has failed?

Like I said - everything in public and every signed key broadcast.
People have to present an undyed finger on their left hand in public to get their key signed, the dye can't be washed off, and the list of signed keys has to be broadcast to be valid so each person can only have one signed key, once it is signed they get their finger dyed and can't come up to get another key signed or go to another location.
It is decentralised, it is possible, it is in use now(so we know it works) and it isn't so technically complex and mathematically brilliant you can't explain it to most people.
A public event means it is recorded, generating the key and publishing the list prevents signing keys outside the event, you can watch videos, count how many people went up to be signed and check that number matches both the number of people eligible and the number of people in the published list.
This is far stricter than current regulations so it is more than enough.

If 20% of people used it then it would be massively successful.
More than 20% of businesses would accept it if only 20% of people had it because adoption is cheap and a market is a market.
That isn't my prediction, just making the point that it doesn't need anywhere near 100% of people to use it.

If you trust the random number generator never to produce the same nonce twice that is fine, but whenever I'm asked to "trust" anything I ask what's in it for me and what could I lose if my trust is misplaced, who's asking and would I know if they lied.
In this case - there's nothing in it for me, I could lose all the money at a given address, I don't really know enough about the manufacture of the chips and I couldn't personally detect faulty/manipulated chips.
It doesn't matter how likely it is, it worries me that I would be asked to trust something functions correctly when there are trust-less alternatives available - in this case I can safely use different addresses without trusting anyone, in their case they could generate nonces themselves.
Personally, I use different addresses but organisations using a single donation address do not have that luxury.

My point is that people are focusing on getting people to hear their name when the exposure itself is only the beginning of the battle.
A lot of companies make that mistake when they advertise - the ones that succeed focus on  how to advertise to generate SALES, to generate a RETURN not EXPOSURE.
Aiming for exposure would be like aiming to have people come into your brick and mortar shop and leave without buying anything. What kind of half baked plan is that?
It isn't about eyeballs it is about profit.
Since Bitcoin itself can't make a profit, this is kinda silly.

Look at email. You can SEND an email FROM anyone without a password. The better spam filters may pick it up but it is possible to send an email from anyone.
Speaking of Spam - there is so much email spam because the protocol is designed in a way that encourages it. We never even changed the protocol, we just filter it out on the server because we're stuck with that bad decision.
Even though Proof Of Work, exactly as it is used in Bitcoin, was first proposed as a method of signing emails and preventing spam - because to calculate the proof of work would take time and you couldn't send tens of thousands of emails a second any more. Note, even though the idea came, was presented to people and is good, we never used it.
Proof of Work never made it back into the protocols we use for emails.
Not because there is nothing better than email today, but because when there wasn't people didn't need security because it was only a small group of researchers and universities that knew each other.
Better things have been created since then but because people are so invested in email the decades old flaws are still there - they didn't get fixed and email didn't get replaced.
If you accept half a solution now you should expect to have to live with it indefinitely because that is a real possibility.


It definitely sounds it however I would wager that it sounds worse than it is because this is my opinion as a developer who has invested many hours into decentralised voting solutions, the reason I say "not that one" quite quickly is because I've been having this conversation nearly two years. It's based on what I've seen and what I know from trying; not on the content of your post.
It's nice to see the issue come up again, it's nice to see reward money on offer, but so far all I've heard is "steal x, re-purpose for voting" - if that solution was enough to carry the project through I'd have done that 18 months ago and called it a day.
I'm saying I'll be disappointed because I put the hours into this already not because of your post. If there was software I could have built on that would have met the goals I have, I would have done that.
Some of these problems may even be okay for a Second Foundation (Asimov!) but since I've been working on voting in general, I can't put up with "some fraud" in a general election or on a health care bill.
I'll be disappointed because these solutions don't go far enough, they won't be acceptable outside of the Second Foundation, which means even if the OP pays out the solutions won't be applicable outside of this specific contexts, which is kinda boring by comparison to the alternative - decentralised voting that is completely trust worthy.

I realise it is close to other things but 'stealth address' is a misnomer AND sounds sinister.
The more technically correct names are so esoteric they might as well be in randomly shuffled Dutch.
Secure Address sounds like the other addresses are Insecure Addresses.
Protected address makes standard addresses sound unprotected, something else we would be explaining to newbs until the end of time.
It needs to sound more innocuous without insulting normal addresses.
We should be focusing on the re-use rather than making it sound cool and illicit - 'stealth' is both of those and not descriptive.

Current DRM sucks donkey taint but it exists because the record labels like it.
No! This couldn't replace drm, this would be like replacing clothes with naked for the record labels and artists, it would be the honour system and the artists happy to do that already give their songs away free and take donations. This isn't better than that.
The people who will abuse it will be consumers, because of the lack of DRM.
It would be completely vulnerable to abuse without any significant advantages over simpler approaches.
Don't put the songs in 'coins' and you can make the system work for more people.

Even if we forget about the lack of source and assume the numbers are accurate there's no reason to reach  the conclusion that this is a problem.

Bitcoin can be interacted with in several languages so you don't need to pick one. If you aren't a programmer yourself you probably want to avoid the language debate as it mostly gets emotional and no one wins. Programmers will have languages they love and hate but like wives everyone loves their own the most.
Good security is knowing what can go wrong and knowing how to make sure it doesn't.
If I was hiring a developer I would want to know how they avoid those bugs in how they code and how they work.
I would expect version control software used, I would expect unit testing and I would expect them to have hypothetical knowledge of sites that have in the past had insecurities, how the bug worked and how it could have been avoided.
To build a secure site you need someone who can pin point all the holes in a less secure one.
Feel free to PM me, I realise at this stage you don't want to publicly share a lot of details.
Edit: On a personal note - all good projects start with a good specification(they make sure everything gets build on time and they make sure nothing is a surprise).
Unless you know exactly what code there is to write you can't know how long it will take (or what it will cost) so all you can do is make estimates and they are never ever right.
Good documentation is great if you can get people to keep it up to date(good luck - you'll need it).
Unit testing will help your odds if it is done well. The better your documentation is the better mileage you'll get out of unit testing.
If you are serious about security every line of code needs to be checked (automated testing counts) by someone other then the person who wrote it.

As someone who has been around a while I find the .bar .club .security .london .travel .etc domains all plenty unintuitive but the reality is most people don't type domains, they Google things and click links other people shared.
Before, as long as you knew .com was the official domain and .anythingelse was not, you could avoid a lot of maleware.
These new domains are a cash grab, they've created a near infinite number of products but kept the same prices they had (and in some cases they charge higher prices) than when there was only a handful of TLD's and the digital real estate was genuinely worth more.
They've made the internet harder to use so they can make themselves money. That's all.

Yeah - showing him you know his home address by having packages sent to him with a note that says "I promise not to keep being creepy" will show you have the best intentions and that you aren't creepy!
I'm sorry but if people knew I wanted to be left alone and they had things sent to my house I would feel uneasy.
Every package would be a reminder that I'm being watched by anonymous strangers who know my address, knew enough about me to send me stuff and I'm expected to feel better because the note says they are on my side?
No crazy stalkers have ever claimed to be on their victim's side, right?
You don't need to "know him personally" - he has expressed a desire to not be known personally so I think that should be the end of it.
Trying to act like there's a possibility he might like gifts so it might be okay to send him things is creepy. You stalked him online to find his address. That you found it easy doesn't change that.
The only thing you know about him that comes directly from him is that he wants to be left alone, sending things to his home address because you suspect you might know him better than he knows himself is crazy and creepy.
None of that says "I have your back", it all says "watch your back".

Money begats money; wealth will flow to the wealthy.
Sure - have you seen how all companies only sell things to people in Bahrain where the tax is low and they can void all them pesky socialist EU countries.
Companies go where customers are, they'll still want to operate in countries A and countries B - and countries A and B will likely be part of a large organisation/coalition of countries that all pass the same laws.
There are more countries than A and B (stupid fucking thing to say, who said there was only two countries on the planet before you did? No one, that's who) - they'll all want in because they all have bankers and other corporate entities that bribe/lobby for favourable laws.

Your value (to me at least) is as a user and not as a coder, so don't try and code - you are plenty valuable as you are.
Example: A user can and should ask for "a secure app" but a user should not pick an encryption algorithm.
I wouldn't want you to try and decide HOW the the app should be secured because that's the part *I* know already - that is my job. That's the value I add.
I'm just saying, since you crossed over to my side of the fence and suggested GPS locking the event, that it wouldn't work, so that, in the nicest way possible, you can return to your side of the fence and know why the fence is there.
When I say I value you as a user  I mean it sincerely - you have a perspective I do not and I have a lot to learn from you, but it isn't how to secure an app.
What I want from you is YOUR perspective, not mine, not what you think I need to hear - leave that to me.
Just talk me through the things YOU want from it:
* I want to see events
* I want to ...
I wasn't looking for you to have an in depth knowledge of anything, I was expecting you to do what users normally do - give me a really brief and vague statement and leave the technical details to the technical people because as someone who hasn't been to a Satoshi Square I do not know what you expect from the app so far except that you don't like people shouting bids out and you don't want people far away bidding.
But not what bidding is or how you expect it to work, see?

chargeback fraud,

and censorship.
It is a fraction of the cost of competitors such as Visa and PayPal but without any of their barriers to entry (you don't need to sign up with a bank who can later close your account, take your money, or refuse you a credit card).

@_date: 2013-02-28 00:06:40
It is largely automated.
One transaction doesn't produce a lot of paper. They do hundreds of thousands of them and end up with a large amount of paper, but the handling and document management required for a single transaction is low.
Privacy laws in most places may well prevent them implementing Bitcoin directly to reduce costs, plus they'd still have to do all the paperwork.
Even if it isn't all profit, it is still a significant sum at risk.
One thing about banks is that a given bank will provide several services people will use, once people stop doing one thing they may stop doing another.

The address is derived from the private key. Creating an address is creating the private key then working out the corresponding address.
There are so many possible addresses it isn't possible to create yours randomly.
People create private keys and work out the addresses, well, the software does, one key has one address.
They are pairs, though you can't work backwards from the address.
You can send Bitcoin to any address, it doesn't need exist - that is how addresses can be generated offline and Bitcoin sent there and claimed later, of course you can't  then get the key for it so it is lost forever, otherwise you could get anyone's key if you knew their address.

Think about it this way - even if a key wasn't created with a passphrase there could still be a passphrase that when used would give that exact key.
If the process worked backwards at all it wouldn't be secure enough to use.
Also, if you have the private key you don't need the password.
This is all very 101 stuff - litterally the first bullet point in 'hashes 101' is 'a hash is a one way function...'.

If you encounter someone on the street who says "Want to buy headphones", but if you are meeting someone at a set time and date to trade for a predefined amount, you should be fine.
If you are yet to negotiate over the exact amount (as is common with cars, turn up, kick tyres, offer less than asking), you could leave the amount blank but I would not sign an entirely hand written contract.

The value of everything fluctuates, the general consensus on Bitcoin is:
Short term - stop trying to guess the value! 
Long term - it will go up.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:37:28
Don't get high on your own supply THEmasterENT.
The value is based on how much people are willing to pay for it versus the number of people willing to sell at a given point in time.
If everyone bought Bitcoin based on the value they expect it to have in USD expecting to cash out and be rich and not because they want to buy goods and services in BTC then it won't succeed.
It would be like everyone selling their TV today for a dollar because tomorrow they expect to be able to buy two TVs for that dollar - suddenly everyone is jumping on it and you end up with a bunch of people with no TV and $1.

I would have picked that line, but I see your point and admitedly I typed it in the cold, on my phone without my first coffee - programmers don't do well without coffee.
The fee structure is fairly well explained though:
A transaction may be safely sent without fees if these conditions are met:
    It is smaller than 10,000 bytes.
    All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
    Its priority is large enough (see the Technical Info section below) 
Otherwise, the reference implementation will round up the transaction size to the nearest thousand bytes and then add a fee of 0.0001 BTC per thousand bytes.

A wallet is a collection of addresses. People can't see how much is in your wallet, they can only see how much belongs to a particular address.
You shouldn't use the same address for everything - that means although you can see your wallet balance, everyone else can only see your address balance.
On to the bar - they should be using a different address per customer.
That means you can't look at the address you used to pay for your drinks and see who else bought drinks and how much money they have.

You can't have a completely trustless system where one person has the money and one person has the goods - one has to change places before the other.
It doesn't matter what you invent, you can't fix lying people.
At best, you could have the funds paid to the miner as a fee instead of either party when there was a dispute if you are not willing to involve a third party.
What you can do is collaborate on deciding who is trust worthy and who isn't.
Screw the kids. Support for them comes LATER. In fact, never. They don't need drugs. They are kids.
If you wait until your solution is 100% you will never launch.
What you have to do is set an achievable milestone and go from there. It doesn't matter if it needs improvement, what matters is that it does a set of things well and those things can be improved upon in the future.
In this case, decentralisation is  on the list.
Mixing coins to stay anonymous is by far the LEAST significant technical barrier.
If you are too stupid to realise it is a bad idea to transfer from your Mt Gox account where you uploaded a photo of your passport straight to a drugs market place then you should not be buying drugs online.
Yes, that means some people won't be smart enough and will be left behind the curve until the process can be simplified but it also means that the solution can be tested with less users than the hundreds of thousands that used Silk Road.
Tough. They can use the market place LATER, when it is more secure and time has been spent idiot proofing it.
There are lots of possible solutions to the mixing problem - eg: the Payment address merchants give you isn't their address but the address of a mixer that will pay out to the merchant.
There is no way you cannot trust third parties unless you are willing to code everything personally, are you up for that? Even if you were, to everyone but yourself you are a third party.
If not - you have to go with the next best alternative which is giving the people the option to pick their own third parties.
Again, the other problems far outweigh the mixing problem.
This is like worrying whether or not your vaccum cleaner will work on Mars in the very first meeting discussing colonisation.
The hosting problem and who controls the code are far more significant - if you have to have any insights there it would be useful at this stage - the Silk Road's tumbler was the most succesful part technically speaking - the documents released all mention how hard it made it to track payments so it should not be a priority. Mixing can be added on succesfully to any technology that takes off, creating that technology is the only useful focus point. There is no point inventing mixing 2.0 yet.
On hosting I'm thinking Tor is insufficient and current technology doesn't do the task justice - it needs physical locations.
I'm thinking proof of stake voting for the second. Open source code where modifications are decentralised, where anyone can submit updates for consideration and no one developer would be able to go over the heads of the community to shut down the site.
Let the mixing problem go - it doesn't account for any of the Silk Road's issues.
Unencrypted private messages, TOR's weakness to flooding the network with FBI controlled nodes, the human element of having a person in control who didn't do a good enough job of protecting his own identity - that is where the front lines are.

No, just the same questions dozens of other people have asked.
Fiat is horribly inefficient. As well as the other post about transporting the money, the hardware cost is higher than Bitcoin. Sure, ASICs only do one thing but do you have any idea how much hardware Paypal and Visa use? How much hardware banks use to make sure a million people don't withdraw all their money twice using two cash machines at the same time?
The inefficiency of cash machines themselves which are always on computers. A lot of them are just pc's with windows now.
Their hardware is not used for something else and because it is normal server hardware it doesn't touch the efficiency of ASICs.
Servers processing spending patterns of everyone with an account constantly, over and over again as an antifraud measure.
Hundreds of terabytes of records of personal details in case of an audit. 
Paper copies of those records.
Customer services departments dedicated to policing access to the magic numbers they use to control your money.
As to a big agency making their own hardware to mine huge numbers of Bitcoin - it would cost them millions in hardware and we would see then doing it. We would know someone was dumping enough power to take over.
Bitcoin's value is in decentralisation - they would be spending millions to own 100% of nothing because we wouldn't stick around if they started manipulating it.
On top of that, the ASICs they'd need would be trash afterwards leaving the government to explain why in this economy that was a good idea to use their money to destroy a global network.
0 coins have been lost! We know where every single one is - their owners may not have access to them but we have no way to quantify careless users.

You can't preserve the value of Bitcoin by not trading it for dollars when the value of Bitcoin is based on what people will pay for it in dollars!


That just doesn't convey information. Read it outloud and reconsider what you meant to say.

I think the competition is good while the community is in its infancy and a few people can control things - alt coins provide a way out and just having it keeps people a little more honest.
On the other hand:
I would not be surprised if in 10 years you could mine Litecoin using the computer you are sat in front of now because everyone else stopped.
I think people's faith in Litecoin is a lot less than in Bitcoin within the respective communities, since some of the Litecoin miners are just Bitcoin miners with outdated idle machines and the only thing they do with their Litecoin is take it to an exchange that does Litecoin &gt; Bitcoin.
If it looked like things were trending downwards, I think they would be more inclined to jump ship.

If you don't have a bank account in USD and you are given an unspendably small amount in USD and you don't live in America, you are unlikely to convert money you have into USD as that would incur a fee greater than the small amount.

A hacker could easily enable IMAP and set their client not to delete local messages after they get deleted from the server - I have my phone in front of me, it shows me drafts written on my PC. It still isn't safe.
Every time Google says "Saved Draft", they'd have a copy of that draft.

Selling cheaper would mean that people would buy cheaper and from them instead of the exchanges.
Lowering the price would cause people to lose faith, under cutting the other exchanges with the infrastructure they already have wouldn't be good either. Competition between them empowers consumers.
If Paypal takes an interest in Bitcoin, they will receive complaints about the service they are providing. Even if unintentionally, this will cause some countries to attempt to impose some sort of restrictions - EG: A processor must have enough cash to pay out their customers Bitcoin balances.
While the currency itself cannot be legislated, that does not mean certain business practices cannot be.
Look at the UK - now that the exchanges can no longeer deal direct here, I have to transfer money out of the country into Euros then into Dollars then into Bitcoin.
For Bitcoin to survive, it needs to be more mature before everyone tries to jump aboard - DDOS attacks can already shut down the excahnges we have, we need to look inward and improve things significantly before Joe Public jumps aboard.
When I said get rid of the competition though, I didn't mean get rid of competing exchanges - I meant that Bitcoin is a direct competitor to Paypal, if they cause Bitcoin to do badly they will do better in the long run.

It is kinda meh, I give it a C-.
They say mining is to:


Which is wrong, mining is how pending transactions are processed into current transactions and actually get round to occuring, it does not legitimise past transactions, every full client does that, including the ones that aren't mining.
They also say:


and immediately say


From the same pesron, a line apart. How can it be solid and fragile?
They also misrepresent the community:


We recommend not investing more than you can afford to lose because the price changes, not because we believe Bitcoin itself can be hacked.
Never put in more than you can lose is standard investment and gambling advice, it has nothing to do with how we perceive Bitcoin's security. Those two sentences have no business together.
On top of that, they went with the emotive 


Yeah, supply and demand is a crazy idea. Having a limited number of things to generate value, that's completely stupid - look at how poorly limited edition games do, look at how Van Gogh's work is devalued because he didn't do more copies of each painting.
Bitcoin secures its value by making it impossible to steal directly and impossible to counterfeit - what is crazy or stupid there?.

Point 1 - the problem is that you are pretending all money is now in BTC and it would not happen - people trying to use Bitcoin Paper Wallets as Paper Money will get burned until they realise Bitcoin is supposed to be online.
There will be a market for current banking systems, some companies won't want some transactions on the block chain and some people will want to use paper money for offline transactions.

You can look at the current hash rate from Intel CPU's - it isn't possible to improve that to where it would be competitive with an ASIC with just this one optimisation.
Bitcoin uses double sha256 and regex, over and over and over in a loop with one variable that changes - yes, this improves one of the slower parts, but it does nothing for the string comparison which is also a bottle neck and it doesn't fix having to check each hash then feed the data with a new nonce over and over.

No, they don't become a $10 bill - symbol before numbers.
They become a collection of change.
The transaction looks like this(meant to be more understandable than an accurate representation):
 Dust transaction ID - 1 $0.01
 Dust transaction ID - 2 $0.01
 Dust transaction ID - 3 $0.01
 Dust transaction ID - 4 $0.01
 Dust transaction ID - 5 $0.01
 Dust transaction ID - 6 $0.01
 Dust transaction ID -7 $0.01
 ... etc
Transaction ID XYX - $10
You are right, he has to reference them individually because they were given to him individually, just like if someone gives you change, you now have change.
Having a transaction list thousands of inputs like this makes the filesize very large, hence the fee.
The person who receives the $10 only has to reference the transaction where they received the $10, so when they go to spend it, it looks like this:
 Transaction ID XYX - $10
Outputs 
 $10
**It does not matter if all the dust transactions were sent to the exact same address, you still need to reference them individually, you cannot spend an "account balance" because Bitcoin doesn't have them - what you are doing is passing on ownership of previous transaction(s), which means if you were paid in little amounts you have to reference them all.**

I think they risk to Paypal is greater if they were doing it to make money directly from the value of Bitcoin - if they were ever discovered to be actively gaming Bitcoin's value, that would hurt their investment.

An address that includes a checksum so you can't send it to nowhere.

Not my call. Maybe you should have a payment threshold, maybe if it comes down to trading people for 1/15th of a penny you shouldn't let them cash out. Brick and Mortar currency exchanges here won't even take coins - they only take notes. They'd never take 1/15th of a coin.
I'm talking about coins you are using to donate the ownership of a car because that was your first example.
Asking you to pay more than 1/15th of a penny every time you sell the car so that the rest of the community will record that transaction *forever* is not unreasonable.

Bitcoin is not the ideal method of evading or avoiding tax if you are rich, it wasn't designed for that - with a public blockchain governments could require companies file public keys with tax returns so everything is automatic. It is better placed to repair the current system.

Say - a large TV being shipped to the wrong country but the card hasn't been reported stolen yet.

Your fix is an educational one - telling people to use different keys. For that reason it isn't a fix at all.
No maintenance cost for them - everyone else has to put up with that crap stuffing the blockchain and it is not compatible with Bitcoin. They should be paying for maintenance instead of stuffing Bitcoin which means everyone now needs that data to use Bitcoin.
I don't need to link a new test to an old one so I can keep sharing an earlier, favourable, test.
In real life only the latest test is worth a damn, in Bitcoin old data is permanent. Old data is useless to an std clinic, but it won't ever go away.
Medical records are not a list of transactions, do not pass value and are not suitable for any cryptocurrency.
There is no reason to use ANYcoin for this, it is just popular to shoehorn the blockchain into solutions.

Laws in the UK make it illegal to gain unauthorised access to a system electronically, even public systems like Bitcoin.

It is unlikely to successfully manifest itself like this.
Lists are likely to have small circulations - that is, you would only see comments from people who had shared them with you.
It wouldn't be like ad block where the lists are public - it doesn't make sense.
You don't really want to mark coins, you want to mark a given transaction and you really want to include whether you are the person giving or receiving in that transaction. Anyone you share those details with can look at other transactions made from the same wallet and will know it was you.
As the link to your wallet removes a layer of privacy, no one would want to share that with the world in general.
I doubt it would be used by merchants at all, more likely it would be used by people to judge the feedback of stores they'd never used but their friends had.
There is no chain of trust with large lists. I trust my friend to tell me that a place that where shopped didn't deliver, but I don't trust you to compile a list of places you've never shopped but you've heard bad things about.

CPU mining is very inefficient in terms of power use, newer ASIC machines will use a fraction of the energy.
It isn't just a race for hash power, it is a balance - trying to get the right amount of power while keeping electricity and hardware costs down so that it remains profitable.
It is a race to profitability.
Having all the power in the world is useless if it costs more to buy or run than you can make back. It isn't enough to keep adding power.
It is self regulating in this way.

The Paypal/Ebay combo is two separate functions - money handling and dispute resolution. Bitcoin is designed to compete with both.
They do this by having access to your money so they can take more than you've ever commited to a given transaction if they wanted. Eg: They could close your Paypal account with $10 in it over a $5 item dispute.
Bitcoin itself is money handling, no question there.
You can also have arbitration in Bitcoin, where a transaction is made up of a sender, a receiver, and a trusted third party that decides who gets the money if the sender and receiver have a disagreement. They don't have to decide straight away, they can wait until the seller claims they shipped an item and the buyer didn't agree to to the transaction.
For example Bit-e-bay (may or may not exist, imaginary Bitcoin based ebay-esque websites) works like Ebay except you pay for goods with in Bitcoin with an M of N transaction that includes Bit-e-bay and the person with the goods.
The person with the goods knows that you have the money and have commited it to the transaction, then they send the goods.
If there is no dispute, both the seller and the buyer sign the Bitcoin over the the seller and Bit-e-bay doesn't get involved.
Although you would be commiting the Bitcoin before the item was shipped, it wouldn't be available to the seller until after you received the goods so they couldn't claim you didn't pay.
If there is a dispute, Bit-e-bay can decide whether the seller or the buyer gets the funds but can never take them for themselves.
This wouldn't likely be implemented by Ebay as they want Paypal to take your payments and collect transaction fees. That means it would be implemented by their replacement.
It is also the answer to Paypal because where Paypal refused to let people donate money to Wikileaks, with Bitcoin, no one can stop it happening.

Bitcoin has parallels with what a voting system needs but it also has some big misses too.
In Bitcoin the wealth originates from miners who create and distribute it.
No one should have to mine votes.
Everyone should get the same vote but with money you want different transactions to have different values.
I will say that Bitcoin came with a lot of good lessons but it is also purpose built.

@_date: 2013-08-04 21:06:05
Yes I have, and legally they log every address they assign you and when so if a warrant comes in for a particular IP address it will also be for a particular date and they can see which customer had it on that date.
Legal requests sound like "Who had {IP address} on {date}" not "Who has IP address X". Sure, with DHCP your assigned IP address will change, but they know which one they gave you and when they gave you it.
It is the law they store this -

Not really, it doesn't matter if a miner doesn't finish their allotment, what maters is preventing wasted effort by having the same numbers mined twice.
It doesn't matter if a section in the middle never gets checked because there are multiple valid nonces and they are just as likely to be anywhere.
You deliberately assign more than each miner can handle so that on a great day there is no overlap.
I realise it is unsettling to just skip over sections but since there is so much space to search everyone can be given a massive search area and because there are multiple randomly distributed valid nonces you don't lose out by not getting every number between 0 and the maximum possible.  
If you add a transaction everyone needs to start again anyway. 
If your mining pool decided never to mine nonces 0 to 1 billion for religious reasons then your pool would be just as successful.
It doesn't matter what doesn't get mined, just that you keep the miners running on new material that only they will run.

It isn't a home work lesson.
If you use an online system for an in person transaction, delete the messages from the scammer during the dispute and don't even follow up the police report by calling the police station you look suspicious.
There are plenty avenues for the OP to go down if they are legimate.
The only reasons to just harrass localbitcoins on reddit are a lack of understanding or believing the police wouldn't think the evidence supports them.
I personally would have called the cops the moment I had the ability to. Then you get the added bonus of being able to report the scammer for faking their police report at the same time.
Apparently I've to believe that while being scammed the OP deleted the texts from the scammer because "that's what they do" and to believe that they wouldn't make a phone call to save themselves from losing $700.

Then m.tgox, (and rn.tg0x, etc) and MntGox and MtGock...
As far as typo squating goes, q isn't close to g. It isn't likely to be found by accident. I don't think they should have bought this domain in advance - sure, by .net of your actual domain.

The visible text is only part of the actual text, there is hidden text in there.
As some of the hidden text contains commands and new lines (ie: the enter key) when you paste it into a terminal it pastes those commands with the new lines.
Because you run commands in a terminal by pressing enter, the commands are executed as you paste them, so you do not get time to double check what they are before you run them.
If you were to paste them into another window - notepad, reddit comment window, you would safely see the hidden command.

I don't care if you are right, or how strongly you believe you were right - it still isn't the most important thing.
A good salesman can sell bullshit faster than a bad salesman can give away gold.
You could blame them, rant for a little while, feel angry for a little while and move on once it dissapates. 
Or you can look at what options you have, what you could do better.
RIETS have existed since the 60s, while maybe Healthcare REITS was new to them, it wasn't completely foreign teritory. I'd imagine some of them have at least heard the word before.

Personally, I'd start with looking for evidence.
If evidence fails, I guess I'd talk to people - only a limited number of people can know they have mining equipment so that is a good start.
The police on the other hand would just write it down, they wouldn't make any special effort to find it or the thief.
A smart person wouldn't trust a crack head not to tell everyone said smart person hired them, the easiest way to keep a secret is to keep the number of people who know that secret at 1.
Just instructing the crack head what item to take and where to find it is more effort than it is worth.

We don't need a DPR, we need a Satoshi - Silk Road's replacement needs to be decentralised and not under the control of its creator. Satoshi no longer controls or could assume control of Bitcoin - any open market place that expects to survive will have to follow that road.
It means there will never be the massive profits in it for the creator like there was with the Silk Road, but it also means that the motivating factor will be an open uncensored market and not greed.
I think that's a big thing right now - the Silk Road left a $1 billion market gap, I expect to see a lot of clones started by people who's greed outstretches their technical ability to protect the anonymity of themselves and the users shortly followed by news of arrests.

Sorry, I may have been editing my original post when you made this reply.
As per my edit - if you sell mined Bitcoin to another person you are a money transmitter. That does not mean you can't spend your Bitcoin directly on goods (which is specifically allowed) or cash out through an exchange (which is not another person).
While MtGox does facilitate the exchange, if you look at your bank receipt after cashing out through MtGox, does it show the person they matched you with or MtGox on the statement?
If it shows MtGox, they are the money transmitter.
Although MtGox works by matching you with someone who wants to sell at the price you want to buy at or who wants to buy at the price you want to sell at you never actually deal with that person.
If you want to buy you send money directly to MtGox.
If you sell MtGox is the one who pays you.
Sure, someone else may have paid them but isn't that true of all transactions? Everyone gets their money from someone else, that doesn't make every person with money a money transmitter.

I agree that we need more reputable and accountable merchants.
It doesn't even have to be a person that you use as the third party, you could use a computer program - as long as it was trusted and impartial.
If you trusted a 3rd party enough to handle desputes, they would be able to implement Bitcoin transactions where you didn't need to trust the person you were sending the money to. The person you are sending money to wouldn't be able to take it and run off.
You would only need to trust the 3rd party.

No! No explanations, none of your predictions - you only just got here. Especially no Alt Coins from you.
Don't invest more than you can lose.
There is nothing that overrides that rule, especially nothing as ephemeral as what you thought the price would do after only being here a month.
If you miss out on hitting it big because you couldn't afford the risk that is life, at least rent gets paid and you live indoors.
You let your greed convince you everyone else was wrong and now you are back for false hope.
If you make the same mistake again you will face the consequences again.
You think the rest of us who've been here years don't see every price increase and think "Damn, if I'd used my rent I'd have a few extra thousand dollars right now"?.
Of course we do, we also see people like you, all the freaking time.
So - no. No excuses, no reasons, no justifications.
You never, ever, EVER, invest more than you can lose.
There is never a reason good enough - there's always a graph that looks like its on the up, about to be on the up or couldn't go any lower.
The difference between the people who win and the people who lose is that the people winning aren't using money they need so they have no need to pull it out until they are happy so when they pull out they are always happy.
That one simple rule means that you can always be happy. However, it means that if you don't have a huge amount of liquid capital you have to live with not becoming rich. We'd all like more, we all have to accept the reality. In your case, the reality is you don't have mass sums of money you can risk on Bitcoin's success to get rich with little to no effort right now.
You have to see all those people getting rich and not be one of them, you don't get to buy the cars they get to buy.
There's plenty of people like us who have faith in Bitcoin and bills to pay - you have to be satisfied with the profit you can safely make and not get suckered in by being jealous of everyone else.
People like you always have to pull out for some unrelated reason because they need the money.
That's why you don't use money you need, the reasons you need it will overrule the patience you need to make a profit - you will have to sell early.
You let your greed overcome your reason and now you are paying for that.
Drink this lesson in and just stop now.
The price could do anything, anyone saying they know otherwise is lying. If they believe it, it is because they are also lying to themselves.
The people who can't stop generally go to Gamblers Anonymous - the problem is the same - you think your luck will come in so you are spending money you can't afford to.

The difference between you and Walter is you can still have the coins in 5 years and they'll likely be worth more.
As for adventuring - you've picked a career you looked forward to right? I've had shitty jobs and jobs I like, while doing the shitty jobs I bought things to make up for the shitty job so everything felt okay in balance. I spent a lot less money while doing jobs I liked because the job was satisfying.
You'll appreciate a holiday more after you've worked a few years, you'll be a little older and wiser, better placed to make decisions. There will be opportunities for time off.
You also don't want to be like the Walter White who could have had money, passed up the opportunity (in your case trading it for a holiday) and suddenly you run into a situation that you couldn't have predicted and you need it.
Everyone thinks they should do a bunch of stuff when they are young - sure, when we died at 35 that may have been true, but these days the people who are happiest saved during their younger years and managed to buy houses they actually paid for and are able to retire early.

I had not looked into TOR to know that there were hosting companies who thought they can stay hidden.

From there they can install code that discovered that server's real IP address in two lines of code max in any language.
However, if you look at the code it is quite scary.

You can't - most clients don't even obey the existing scripts in case a rogue one causes a fork.
If you are worried about them changing the timestamp why wouldn't you worry about them changing the block number? 
Not a worry anyway, the scriptsig wouldn't work if they changed the time.
Your example isn't workable, no one is holding into a mined block for an hour, it'd get mined by someone else.
If you were using the timestamp with the existing commands, you could declare the outputs inside of the if statement, giving different amounts per timestamp.
The increase is possible - all inputs have to be spent, in practice that means leftover is sent to a change address. The fee could be altered by sending different amounts to your change address.
If block # = x
2 satoshis to recipient
1 satoshi to fee
1 satoshi to change address
If block # = y
2 satoshi to recipient
2 satoshi to fee
If block # &gt; y
4 satoshi to change address
That way only one set of outputs would be valid and if your transaction happens after block y it all goes to you.

If you could journey into VISAs data centre you wouldn't be worried about the energy mining uses and whether it could be better spent elsewhere.
That will come as we start to use credit cards less and they turn off some hardware or when credit card companies start updating their system so they can compete with Bitcoin on cost.
The Bitcoin network is one of the most efficient of its type because it is hyper competitive.
While VISA might run a legacy machine for years because it is expensive to update the code to run on a new server to replace it, Bitcoin has already moved on to ASICs - hardware built specifically for the task.
While VISA may update old hardware infrequently, Bitcoin miners are counting electricity usage and just looking for an excuse to upgrade.

Say we trade Bitcoin for cash. After 6 confirmations you go away.
With a 51% attack, I replace those 6 blocks with 7 blocks(if there are two different chains longest chain is considered to be real, the shorter is disgarded) and instead of the transaction where you got paid there is a transaction with the exact same coins except they go to another one of my addresses.  
The last part is important because you could save the transaction and rebroadcast it and add it to the end of the new blocks.
I'll save explaining why this devalues Bitcoin. 
6 is supposed to be enough blocks to wait to protect you from someone making a replacement chain without your transaction as with 1 confirmation this attack is possible with a lot less hash power.

Centralising Bitcoin wouldn't be a small change to the code we could miss, it would be a huge change and not one they could just force on us - there are open source Bitcoin clients, the protocol is open source.
It isn't just money they would need to make this change, they would need the cooperating of every single user and miner.
Given people are drawn to Bitcoin because it is decentralised, would you roll over and take that?
Of course not - we would be split into Bitcoin and Therecoin and if some people refused to move to the new network and they allowed everyone to keep their current balance instead of starting Therecoin completely new where everyone started with no money, you would get two coins (one on each network) for one you owned. That would kill the price, no matter what funds they have it isn't happening.

You can't buy food with Bitcoin where I live.
I can't pay my electricity bill in Bitcoin where I live.

Not once you've run the miner long enough to know the speed.
Once you do, you only need to assign everyone in the pool a range of numbers to check that is large enough to last them until the next block.
If you know you can get through around 20,000 Ghz in ten minutes you get assigned a block of 20,000 hashes to check.
You only need to communicate the start number and end number once per block per miner. 
If you aren't assigning overlapping ranges of numbers it doesn't matter which have and haven't been checked.
There are multiple golden nonces so you just need to make sure to try as many different numbers as you can.

I'm always happy to admit to being blunt but whatever you say to someone with beliefs has to be enough to make them step back and have perspective on them whether they are right or wrong.
Otherwise it isn't a conversation, it is a competition to see who believes strongest.
Sure, there are softer sells, but I'm lazy and my opinion is free.
I don't think there is *an* answer - the people who need to liquidate and pay for things with USD have to sell on CampBX and the price there goes down, the people who have dollars stuck in MtGox need to buy and the price there goes up.
Arbitrage is the gravity between them that stops it going crazy - $10s appears to be the value of schleping between them.
MtGox is also more well know, people are willing to pay more for Coca Cola than Walmart Cola. MtGox has held a higher price for longer, people expect it to have difficulties, but it seems to have staying power - given we've lost a few exchanges, it isn't impossible more could go.
A few really big players could cause a $10 difference, so could thousands of individuals - the truth is probably a mixture of both.

UML is mostly what most people would naturally draw - certain types of diagrams use stick figures with speach bubbles. It really formalises what most people were doing anyway.
I'd advise against an actual app if you can avoid it. They are just in vogue. As evidenced by Rockstar's GTA V needing you to download a mobile app to change your license plate on the console. 
Programming for a mobile device is not the friendliest thing to learn, there's the extra barrier of needing to run a mobile emulator (or 3).
All 3 of the popular mobile OS's run on different languages and the iPhone requires permission from Apple, paying a fee to Apple and owning a Mac so you could end up needing to build it thrice.
By comparison, if you were to look at Responsive CSS Design, that would allow you to build a single website that would look correct on all sizes of screens and jQuery/mobile jQuery (it is a javascript library) for the functionality, you would only have to build it once.
It would still run on mobiles, but it would also run on PCs and Macs.
CSS and HTML are easy to pick up, a factor of 10 easier than programming languages, Responsive CSS is just a method of writing the CSS so it will be cross browser compatible and you can learn standard CSS first.
A lot of people think "I want to build an app" where what they really mean is "I want my work on a phone".

I don't see a strong enough case for this, all I see is 'I can't compete with ASIC miners'.
It would be hard to develop and polish the idea so it can stand next to Bitcoin without standing out.
It isn't mining if it doesn't generate coins, it is just solving the proof of work.
It couldn't produce a 'full block' 1 in 1,000 times if the difficulty was 1,000 times lower because the proof of work for a transaction wouldn't be valid for a block because a block's hash requires all the transactions to be included and the previous block, which is also why it cannot be precomputed.

Javascript in practice can be a little messy as a lot of web developers are trained in web development but not standard programming techniques - which is fine for a dozen lines of code but for more you need proper organisation and a methology.
On the other hand - it is possible to write well organised javascript that is pleasing to read. It mostly depends on who's writing it.


Don't ask me what - I program the things people pay me to - come back to me when you've an idea you need to know if it is possible and how it should be deconstructed. :)
A lot of programming problems are knowing how to correctly apply a little knowledge (there really aren't more than a handful of concepts and keywords in most programming languages - they can take a while to grasp them, but afterwards the same dozen things can be used in an infinite number of conversations).
It's taking an idea, a process, and turning it into very basic component parts and working out on paper how they should interract. Typing code is just a formality.
I recommend having a look at some [UML]( - think of it as the stage between a real world problem and writing code that mimics it.

There are plenty of people who got into cpu and gpu too late to make a return.
There are other reasons - for the ASICs to be a reasonable price you can't make 1. You need to manufacture quantities to get the prices down. For that you need capital, hence the pre-orders.
BFL probably couldn't have raised enough money by themselves to manufacture the chips and run them until a profit was made.
Even if they did, by personally having control of that much hashing power they would hurt people's confidence in Bitcoin.
That doesn't mean their customers won't see returns, though late customers may miss the boat.

To make a rainbow table you need to know all the variables - there is no point saving the values of previous hashes, the point of a hash is that changing a tiny part of the input completely changes the output.
Since one of those variables is the previous block you can't generate a rainbow table until that block is generated.
At that point you can start building a rainbow table.
You can't build a rainbow table in advance.

I didn't.
It doesn't raise the difficulty relative to the equipment you added nullifying it, I never said that.
It does increase the difficulty and ASIC Miner would increase their capacity to maintain their share.
However, doubling your equipment after a point doesn't double your return.
If Bitcoin is left with one mining company it has no value for libertarians or people who just want a decentralised currency and assuming litecoin would still have a network of miners you would be able to buy all the Bitcoin you wanted as people cashed out.

I also get to compare it to other things I have worked on and with and it is definitely very early on - by the time Bitcoin is in common usage there will be an infrastructure built on top of it and online banking that more closely resembles real banks.

There is an investment COST - paying it to someone who's programming skill is nill because he says he's got so good an idea that he's going to build it on his own is a risk, even if only in electricity, however, the average person will not be able to compete with people who already own mining rigs and who turned them off because the difficulty rose.
You would be GPU mined to hell.
Since ASICs already exist, unless you change the hash algorith to one no alt coin uses, they will be mined by people who already have the equipment, more of the same of what we have now.
So, anyone wanting to get in just for your alt coin would be buying equipment just for your Alt Coin, that is a risk.

The majority of people with Bitcoin did not mine them, they bought them - buying your currency is the risk.

All of it except this:






There are SEO, PPC, PPI, spam and scams to name a few which are low cost, high profit and can be automated to a large degree. There's also 0-day reward programs that are all profit and legal money.


This is not accepted fact.


Traditional methods of making money are easier than finding bugs in cryptography that powers most of the internet.
There has been one cryptography bug active in the wild that relates to Bitcoin - compare that to browser bugs, OS bugs, flash bugs, java bugs, javascript bugs, wordpress bugs, forum software bugs, mysql bugs and that one random bug is a rounding error.


If it wasn't for btcrobinhood et al, we would have been screwed. A mallicious hacker could have compiled all the weak addresses into a single list offline and blitzed through them all in a handful of blocks.
Sure, it would have been visible, but they could have taken everything at once and by the time people started complaining it would have been far too late to identify how they did and and how it should be combatted and it wouldn't be fair on the legitimate transactions to reverse those blocks.


As the blockchain can be worked over offline, this is misleading as it is written.


There isn't enough overlap between Bitcoin's cryptography and other methods of cryptography for this to be true enough to be left undisputed.
There is far more incentive to look for bugs that effect SSL or the security used by wifi as they are more widely used by a few significant digits.
I mean sure, there will be some difference made by Bitcoin, but encryption already protects all our banks - that is plenty incentive already. It isn't so much a nitro boost as puting a spoiler on a smart car.

It isn't about profiting from piracy at all and it isn't a conversation I was having - I don't care if they are profitable, I was just stating the fact that enjoying what they do does not stop them being profitable. I didn't say profit was a negative or a positive, I stated it was possible. The judgement was added on by you just now.
My problem is specifically with ratio enforced trackers that sell ratio improvements. Not with sites that do one or the other, not with sites that contain arguably copyrighted material. It is the combination of the two suckering users who don't understand math that gets me.
Again, this isn't a debate on piracy, it is specifically a statement aimed at selling ratio improvements and enforcing ratio - to try and extend what I say to cover all pirate sites is beyond useless because I never said that. You would just be arguing with what you would have liked me to have said.
As to the level of trust you want to give them, up to you but I'm not enthusiastic about the phrase "Fairly transparent".
Sites don't get shut down because they are profitable, they get shut down because they are too popular. If you make money and no one knows about you then you get a pass, if you are popular (see the pirate bay) laws get passed and people go to jail.
The RIAA and the MPAA are looking for returns when they shut down sites.

Exactly, consumers are already conditioned to use online banking, Bitcoin is an extension of that, they will adapt as result.
Again, Bitcoin can be made as simple as developers can want to make it, the banking system simply can't adapt fast enough to compete long term.
It can be made to emulate familiar online banking paradigms for those it will appeal to.
Anyone can make use of Bitcoin's infrastructure and add to it, the idea that it isn't what people expect is irrelevant, if there is a market for it someone can create and monetise it.

Roommates? Shit... that's worse than family.
You got a text to your phone that you didn't remember. If you hadn't read it, it would have been showing as an unread text - the fact that you went back and had a text but didn't mention anything else in your post means when you went back that text wasn't showing as unread.
You would have said "I went back and there was a text but it was unread". You didn't, so I think it is safe to say it was read.
Am I right? When you looked did your phone say someone had read that text?
And you don't remember it.
The verification code was read by someone, you don't remember being that person.
A code specifically needed to steal your money that you received to your phone and someone read it before your money got stolen.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to buy into Bitcoin anonymously.
The majority of users are better using an exchange than risking a face to face transaction.
As the result of know your customer laws, money laundering laws, etc, it is trivial for the government to know who is buying into exchanges.
It at least makes it easy to see who is moving a lot of wealth through exchanges and investigate them further - Bitcoin is a zero sum game, there are no loans or money from nowhere so once you have got a starting point you can follow the money.
Sure, there are ways you can make it difficult or impossible to trace but there will be evidence of you hiding money, even if there isn't evidence of where it went.

    and the following philosophical objections may also apply:
    
    (*) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever
    been shown practical
    ( ) Any scheme based on opt-out is unacceptable
    ( ) SMTP headers should not be the subject of legislation
    (*) Blacklists suck

    (*) Sending email should be free
    ( ) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?
    ( ) Incompatiblity with open source or open source licenses
    (*) Feel-good measures do nothing to solve the problem
    (*) Temporary/one-time email addresses are cumbersome
    ( ) I don't want the government reading my email

I am having trouble reading the value from existing transactions, not assigning it.
However, inputs do not have values, check the wiki -  - only outputs have values.
It is not possible to spend some of a transaction, you have to spend 100% of it 100% of the time. So it doesn't need to list the value for the inputs in the transaction because it would always be 100% of the funds anyway.
Your client being smart notices that the amount in the output is less than the sum of all the unspent inputs and adds another output sending the remainder to your change address.
You could send that money to more than one places, hence the output values.

I agree mostly - I like what Bitcoin does with its Blockchain and how it works however, I have seen people advocate using it without enough modification - calling Bitcoin Votes and just letting them spend it at a given address to vote. With votes being issued and needing to be mined. I find that slightly scary.
I do like that the blockchain has a method for rewarding participants but I can't think of an elegant way to include that and not make yet another alt coin.


I want to remove as much of the establishment that functions either against the people or that needs to keep secrets from the people to function. I want to get rid of the system where people are only given the illusion of choice - by giving them the choice of two or three candidates who may meet none, some or all of their election promises after they win because although they get to choose which people will have power on paper, they have no control over the use of power. 
I don't want power - which lets be fair, in most governments is a collective expression of the citizen's wealth - to be used in ways that the people themselves disapprove of. Currently, as long as you get elected, you can ignore the people when it comes time to act on their behalf.
What's the point of voting on candidate A because he's the only candidate who advocates a policy you like only to have him change his mind and go the other way once he is in office? There is no point!
I want something different.


Greetings and damn - I post a lot! To be fair, I do most of my reading on my phone so RES doesn't catch most of the posts I upvote.


I'm just a developer who likes to develop and seeing Bitcoin with what I know of it, it isn't complex, it is elegant. I want to feel as happy about the solutions for other things. I feel least happy about politics.


You can't protect people from themselves. I think at best you can give them the choice - if they don't want people to know how they voted they shouldn't advertise it. That doesn't stop people lying on Facebook so your racist aunt won't know you voted for a black guy. The Facebook data can be poisoned some.


My solution is probably not perfect (or am I done with it), at present I have settled on a variation of mixing votes. It mostly suffers from what you mentioned - people watching you vote - more than anything else. I'm with you on that part being a social rather than technological issue. You can't program away people watching you.


Until last week I was willing to sacrifice complete anonymity for a truer democracy - I'm with you there.


When I think "what is the risk of profiling voter groups" I think of Isaac Asimov's Psychohistory and not particularly a real world instance where it could be used to do evil.
I think "for an extra step in the process, we can delay that problem". I don't think it is important to launch perfectly, I think it is more important to launch at all but I see where potential evil can be avoided, even though I don't know what it would look like in practice.
Where Bitcoin is money it is different - if everyone who created wallets with version 0.4 and below could have their money stolen Bitcoin would have died then and there - I have testing opportunities Bitcoin didn't get.
Let people use it small scale, test it, improve it.
The PTA meeting can use it to decide a chair person without there being any risks of profiling. That gives people time to use the software and people like us time to change the parts they won't have to interact with. The parts that make certain things work but that won't change the interface so they won't have any re-learning to do to use it.


I couldn't balance the need to encrypt with the need to decrypt - while encryption makes votes safe, it also makes them opaque.
The problem as I saw it is that, essentially:
To vote, a person needs a secret (key, token, whatever) only they know and have access to however that same secret proves which vote is theirs and by not encrypting it the value of the vote is knowable.
The problem is, unless you make them vote under control conditions they still have whatever secret proved they voted.
I came up with separating the two concepts and separating the problem into stages - essentially mixing the votes and letting people approve of the mix.
It requires a lot less complicated maths than other versions but keeps more implementation details from needing to be encrypted or otherwise hidden but it gives every user the ability to count votes for themselves - I like that.
Just now, I'll call a collection of votes a "block" of votes because of Bitcoin, I like the symmetry.
For simplicity, 100(or 10 or 1 million) people submit their votes to the network anonymously.
Each person in turn receives a block of 100 votes. They each check for their vote, if they are happy they sign the whole block. No one can know which vote in the block you were happy with.
Once all 100 people have signed the block we can be happy it isn't being tampered with.
However, we have the problem of secrets - so, for that block to be valid, all 100 secrets (whatever form they take) are also published to the network and attached to the block. Once the network has confirmed the block, the secrets aren't a security risk if published as they are single use.
If 99 people release secrets and the last person doesn't, everyone just votes again, new block, new process, completely new secrets. It isn't a problem as votes in an "incomplete" block can be discarded.
They can then know in their heart that their vote is really theirs, but they no longer have the evidence to prove it to anyone else. They can look at it and see who the vote is for. They can look for it in the final count too.
Votes are not valid until all the above has happened.
In short, a valid block therefore is a block:
Where all the participants have keys authorised by whomever prevents multiple voting.
Where there are x numbers of votes.
Where the people voting have only used their counterpart secret only once in this election.
Where the block is signed by x number of keys meeting criteria 1.
Where the secret information required to create the block is published.
It is secure from people who want to do anything on a large scale after votes are cast which accounts for the biggest area of concern.
It is however an improvement on what we have though not perfect - I think that makes it a good candidate for a next step even if we don't stick with it long.
Sharing secrets isn't an option for Bitcoin because I might, even if only accidentally, reuse addresses. In a system where a secret(whatever that means in practice) is only used once, you can give it up as soon as you are happy the network won't use it to modify existing data and if everyone else does the same the secret no longer proves your identity.
In this case, I have a few different ideas as to what the temporary secret would look like, but I think in practice the solution will work.
There is obviously the risk of being paired with 99 people who all want to reveal your identity amongst other potential pitfalls, but I think since you gain the ability to keep your anonymity when it all goes well and it requires a lot of coordinated collusion to unmask a single person to where you can say X vote for Y was cast by person Z I like the solution.
Mostly, I like that I can explain it simply to people and that it is less technology/maths heavy.
You can use a pack of cards, give 20 people a card, put all (or some) of the cards into a pile and shuffle them.
Then, revealing all the cards, have each person say whether or not their card is in the pile (and nothing more).
Unless all 20 people collectively pick a card, no one person's card can be identified as being theirs.
Each person can know their card is in the stack but if you had 1 of them on their own and all 20 cards, you could never be sure they were telling the truth.
I think people will understand that version of the explanation.
There are implementation details that deal with people who WANT to have evidence of ownership of a secret before anyone else could know(maybe so they can sell the vote) - eg: they could include their secret in a Bitcoin transaction comment to prove they had it before the vote network published it but I couldn't think of a way to include them in the card analogy.
Despite that, I think the basic idea is not beyond most people.
I hope it isn't too vague in this form - I'm still shuffling around specific technologies so I've stuck to generics. 
There are lots of specifics relating to implementation, safe guards and abuse prevention left out but nothing fatal. 
Edit: As long as a block of votes are signed by the voters collectively, it doesn't matter how the vote is uniquely distinguished as long as no one can prove they did it., eg: a signed message converted into a 10 bit number would be no good, people could convert it back and verify the signature.
It only needs to be unique so people can sign the block with their vote, the votes themselves don't need to be secure so much as the block does. You don't need any secret information in the vote itself however, I allow for cases where another method of generating the votes is used.
At best, you can only ever claim that your vote is inside a given block -  you can't prove which vote is yours and no one would know if you lied.
At their simplest votes need to only be:
Then you can send that vote to the network and sign the block that it appears in and knowing the UniqueID and the Outcome isn't proof that's your vote.
However, then you lose the ability to look at all the votes individually, trace them, and see when fraud occurred.

It would be better if citizens get to present one public key each and the government signs it.
If governments were providing the private keys the government would store them.
If they were stored the government could use them to vote or they could get stolen.
Each voting option could be a separate message.
The government can publish the list of public keys.
The voting software works by having people sign the option they believe in.
Only votes on the published list are counted by the government.
People from any country can then vote on any law they like then view the results by people in their country.
Issues could then be voted on without further government intervention - any issue can be raised and voted for swiftly and several layers of bureaucracy are immediately useless. 
Political corruption would become more difficult. You can't lobby everyone.
People would eventually force the government to conduct all business in Bitcoin or something resembling it.
A government that has to operate with known addresses and send money only to addresses linked with a known person or business.
Our governments would then only be able to act and spend in a way the public could stomach.
A government controlled publicly like this is still capable of military defence if the people believe in the cause and paying for it but won't be seen as a threat by neighbours who can verify they aren't planning a preemptive strike 
As more countries adopted the system defence spending would take a nose dive. If we can check that no one else buying tanks maybe we don't need to either.
A system like this makes the big things we all want available quickly and it doesn't support the industry over people and there are no choke points.
We would be able to allocate at least a portion of the tax we pay personally. The paperwork would be easy, the government sees the transaction signed with your id and if you have tax left to pay the deduction is automatic.
It would be great for people. 
I realise this might open the door to blackmailing for votes however to win by blackmailing you would need to have something on tens of thousands of people and stop the word getting out that someone is blackmailing in support of a given view point.
It makes it impossible to threaten enough people to win.
Compare it to what we have now - a system where with one picture of a penis you can corrupt the intentions of one person who is elected to represent hundreds of thousands of people and gain control over an issue.

I have spent a while on it and have gotten to where I've started to throw my ideas out there because it will be possible to create and secure (and I have ideas as to how - I am at the stage where I'm not just thinking "bitcoin could be applied to voting" but at the point where I have on specific idea as to how).
I haven't gotten to writing any official specification or white paper (on it but it is christmas!) so I can't tell you specific implementation details but I think you can use my old posts + my post below to see roughly what I think, where the problems are and the type of things people challenged me on. Being unable to prove how you voted was a bigger thing for other people than it was for me - since making the linked post I think I have a solution that makes them and us happy(though I haven't revealed it yet because I'm still fine tuning).
I think knowing these issues exist is what you want and not my answers anyway so this should be a step in the direction you want to go.

They have to collect taxes in Bitcoin and pay it out as a result of a supporting vote.
Sure they can collect money other ways but they'd lose the ability to use huge amounts of tax money.
Plus they stop really being a government.
They are just criminals, they aren't a government, just gun smugglers.
There can't be government black projects without funding and a government.
Sure there will still be criminals but we're eliminating a large class of super criminals. 
It isn't the last solution we'll need but it should be our next. We can do this for almost everyone, right now.
As for no tax: I call it a tax but really the part I care about is defining a policy for group spending because I want to fund super projects like NASA and food for starving people and health care for sick people.
My current interests don't extend to why the money was collected or the level of coercion used, I'd want any system to work for tax and donations because I don't think each country should be rolling their own voting system, I think a single system that supports multiple modes and models of government will be the one that succeeds.
That way a country cannot be annexed by their leaders because the election is secured by every other country.
Whether they want to use the system to vote on representatives or actual bills or the winner of survivor.
We do need a secure method of voting and if satoshi dice has taught us anything is that you can never be too spam resistant.
We can decide how to spend the money after we've given everyone a voice.

Sure - now they have to find somewhere to spend it, something they want and can afford with just the tip you left because more likely than not that is the only Bitcoin they have. If you have any regard for their time, you've probably realised they just spent most of your tip in time to redeem it.
You may as well given them Yuan and hope someone in China Town will take it.
You wouldn't be tipping them, you would be issuing them a quest and if they don't complete it your tip becomes worthless to them.
Tips are supposed to be a way to show your gratitude - making them jump through hoops to get it does not reflect that.

I don't want miners getting any votes on my transactions.
Why'd I pay a 1BTC fee on a 1BTC transaction and exactly why does sending 1 BTC to a sink address make me trustworthy because the miners will look for a double spend? 
By the time miners can spot a double spend so can normal Bitcoin clients. They don't get extra information because they are miners plus they'd have to wait until the next block to send a satoshi anyway, and why'd they use their money on that? 
They have a method of getting money, mining, this will be abused.

You don't need confirmations for micropayments especially if you are willing to make the occasional loss. 
As long as you connect to a lot of peers rather than the mining pools, watch for obvious double spends and validate the transactions yourself (check they really are unspent and the signature matches etc you can accept them before they go into a block.
Though ultimately it depends on what the transactions are for but you can pick up transactions a few seconds after users make them.
The standard client won't even let you make double spends against transactions stuck in limbo for days - you are safe from the vast majority of people who won't bother to try.

I am a full time programmer, I have a formal education in software engineering and nearly a decade of experience since.
Sure, if you can con people into tutoring you for free it is better than using Google on your own, however if you are unable to find basic information from Google programming is not a persuit within your capabilities.
Programming isn't learning how to do everything or the result of being taught how to do everything, it is being able to cope, on your own, with the things you don't already know.
You failed at that.
You will continue failing because you do not have a programmer's attitude or mindset.
Being able to do maths doesn't make you a programmer anymore than being able to program makes you a mathematician - if you are unable to look up basic concepts, unable to identify even the programming language by looking, you will not succeed at a project of this scope. For you to believe that you can create a cryptocurrency before you have successfully created Hello World is like me believing my first job as a mathematician, with no experience or training, is going to be solving P vs NP (see - I'm not a complete ass, I know barely enough to make a reference pandering to you!).

Other people are very concerned so yes - it is almost a must that any decentralised system makes it not only impossible to track votes but also makes it impossible for a voter to present their vote to a third party and prove how they voted.




While it can be theoretically as secure, as a member of the public you have to trust and believe there is no corruption in such an organisation. We trusted Diebold once.
While it is theoretically as secure, it can't compare to giving the public the ability to see, touch and run the code personally instead of being given a machine and told "this one has the right code on it, promise".
I actually want to keep most of the initial part of elections as they are now, the people who, in full view of other people, check your credentials, tick your name off the list of people who can vote and give you a ballot paper will pretty much keep that job. 
There is no good alternative way to verify someone's identity so you can let them vote once without knowing who they are, especially online.
Since the current system is the best we have been able to come up with, until an alternative arrives, I advocate keeping that part and improving the rest of the process.

It is odd, whether or not you are being serious other people have made the same argument with a straight face.
My current government got 30% of the votes with a turn out in the 40-50% range so a 51% requirement would be an improvement.
There is no reason laws should only require a majority - it could require a 70% consensus if that is more appropriate - the 51% figure isn't set in stone and is far higher than most developed nations anyway as turnout is less than 51% so governments there already work with less approval now.
If a 51% majority scares people, why doesn't the 30% of a 45% turnout we had in the UK terrify them?!

You would not get control, you would have an increased ability to double spend.
There are mining pools with hardware on standby so as the competition turned their equipment on so the existing pools would add more hash power, meaning it isn't enough to match today's figure - you have to compete against that potential.
A 51% attack could devalue the network, meaning you wouldn't get control of the network, you would be increasingly able to pull off a 51% attack, you'd get to mine coins but they'd not be with anything after the attack.
Unless your double spend is anonymous - fraud is still illegal - gets transfered to fiat quickly and is valued higher than your equipment cost you would lose the money you spent on mining equipment, they don't have other uses.

Sure, no questions asked refund are one thing - in the UK we already have that legally, though goods have to be returned.
Paypal fees fund the evil that they do, sure there are a group of people who will never suffer because of it.
It reminds me of the simpsons where homer receives a flyer for a gambling tips hot line with a prediction on it.
They send out different flyers with different predictions so eventually there are some people who've recieved only correct predictions and they end up believing the hotline can predict results.
Just because Paypal doesn't screw everyone doesn't mean it isn't a scam.

Addresses are constructed from private keys using a process that includes hashing, but hashing is seperate from signing/verifying a signiture belonging to an address.
Boring details here - 
Getting away from storing hashes is exactly what the OP is trying to do.


The crux being, when websites store a hash they have to construct the hash again using the components of the hash (which means they need your password) and then they compare it to the hash they already have stored and disregard your password.
That means that your password is "contained" (simplified) in the hash and someone could try lots of passwords to see which one makes your hash.
By comparison, your private key is not stored in the signiture nor public key, the website only gets hold of things that are public and you never have to communicate anything you would not share willingly.

It takes four minutes to send, not deliver,  there is a huge difference.
I don't answer emails as I get them, it is a stupid unstructured way to work.
So, lets say I have 10 emails to reply to.
That's 40 minutes.
Not just 40 minutes to send but 40 minutes where my pc is thrashing to death and mining meaning I can't even use it for work.
Now, if I'm on the train I'm answering emails on my phone. My phone can't do proof of work in 4 minutes, more like 30 and 100% usage would leave me with an hour's battery life at best.
 I build websites that send out more than an email every 4 minutes, it could use pgp/gpg fine, bitmessage adds another 0 to their hosting costs at best though I've had people buy things twice because their receipt email wasn't instant.

There would need to be some sort of network consensus and it would need to relate to the published time, not the time on the miners machine.


Just now - but if we are talking about what it does just now, it doesn't let you include the block number either. Themyos said he would like the script language to be more turing complete - there is still opportunity to change things like this.
For communicating priority to miners, it has been discussed that certain pools may start providing ways to directly send them transactions for preferential treatment in return for larger fees - this would likely be a messaging layer on top of Bitcoin not a change to Bitcoin itself.
For the fees, my pseudoexample above makes the most sense to me (I used block # in it because the current block # is known and therefor the next block # can be included in the script if you want to incentivise being included in the next block. By comparison, if two blocks were found quickly you could be included in the second within the time constraint).
However, for purely sending a transaction that hasn't been processed because it didn't have a fee, a client modification is still a better idea than a script one because the transaction that you are cancelling would be better if it was never added to the blockchain in the first place.
We can also do this now without changing Bitcoin at all - given the amount of time it would take to modify all the clients to understand new script variables, discuss it properly and implement it into Bitcoin itself we'd both be old(er).

I'm a developer and I've been thinking about this for a while and I have collected a mountain of thoughts, potential technical solutions and some philosophical musings. I'll apologise in advance for the lack of the real juicy technical bits, I'm typing this on my phone as I am travelling.
You ask: How can we issue votes 
Philosophically, I say the people shouldn't get their vote from the government, the government should get their vote from the people.
I see that translated to tech like this: anyone can create a vote and cast it, but the government wouldn't need to count every vote they recieved, just the votes of everyone eligible - more later.
A decentralised voting network would secure all votes and voting for everyone (this is in contrast to each country getting their own implementation or running their own).
Why? In places without free elections the people could run their own anyway. Even if the anonymous nature of these elections open them to some abuse, you can still use it to communicate dissent with other dissenters and get an idea if you are a fringe group or a majority without sticking your neck out. 
These elections wouldn't be how we counted votes from now on, they would be parallel to official elections.
A shadow government of the masses allowing people to gauge how much their government is really representing them.
When it eventually becomes time to use the distributed voting network in real politics, you will take your public key with you to the place you'd have cast your paper ballot. 
Instead of handing you a ballot the official would then sign that public key. In the same way they don't write your name on paper ballots they wouldn't record what key they were signing, just that yours was signed.
If you don't trust them to sign keys you shouldn't trust them to hand out the ballots and stop people voting twice.
You could then submit your vote to any node in the world, encrypted.
There would be two types of signiture - one that allowed people to participate in all votes until the next signing event, one where each public key was only useful for one specific voting event.
That way you could have one key signed for local elections and one signed for the national elections if you wanted that level of privacy but would be prevented from using the local election key in the national election, or the convenience of having one key for everything if privacy isn't your worry.
Essentially, for additional privacy you could have a group of public keys signed however each election would only allow you to use 1 of those keys, having 2 signed keys would not give you two votes in this case.
This would also be key in electoral systems where in addition to voting on members of the government you also got to vote on indivdual laws because otherwise you would be using the same key over and over.
Their key would be signed by their boss and so on.
The authorised signers of the public's keys would also be published with the area they were responsible for.
That would mean you couldn't fake votes by adding them to a specific area because you would see 10,000 people voted in a district with only 5,000 people living there.
It would also mean you could trace a group of people to the people who signed their key, which means that person could not use their key to illicitly sign more keys than they should.
A record of the number of people eligible to vote and how many of those officially had their keys signed can be compared to the number of keys signed by that official present in the election results.
You could create different key pairs for different elections so no one could ever prove you voted.
Governments announcing results of the election do so by signing all the votes they are counting as a collection.
Anyone could verify whether or not their own vote was included and challenge it by producing their government signed key and showing that the government ommited it from the results.
Anyone could publish alternative voting results, but as a rule they don't become law or official, just someone's opinion.
Such collections could be derived from election results and be published to the network anonymously if they proved or indicated fraud for example.  
The election results would only count votes from signed keys as valid however unsigned votes could still be pushed to the network, creating an unofficial election for comparison.
Each election occurs on a tree, each node can decide which branches to subscribe to. Maybe you only want your country's elections and your world of warcraft guild's, maybe you also subscribe to China's branch to support voting reform. 
Spam can be ignored at will by nodes, unlike Bitcoin the tree is not linear, you've no obligation to download all of it.
Each vote is a mini block - after the vote is signed against a specific event or outcome from a given keypair the person submitting that votes needs to solve that vote to the current difficulty before they can submit it.
This isn't completely abuse proof but it can raise the cost of faking or spamming significantly. 
Sure, you could build spam generating ASIC rigs, so to combat that voting events can be created by anyone.
That means at the drop of a hat if fraud was found another election could be held, potentially with a different algorithm used for the proof of work and a higher difficulty, making the ASICs useless.
As anyone can create voting events these can also be signed or unsigned.
That means if someone was barred from entering an election he could post his public key and people could vote for him with their government signed keys anyway. 
If an alternative government wanted to rise up, they could just do it - create an organisation, publish that organisation's root private key (I imagine the head creates their own key for each election, and signs their underlings with it who then signs their underligns, all the way down to the person working in the polling station). 
It could also be used by open elections(such as parlimentary members voting on laws) if participants published their public key.
I think I also touched on some of the questions you had in your other posts. 
There is a lot of technical discussion on cutting out spam and fraud.
On this I say **sunlight is the best disinfectant**.
Things voted on don't just automatically get accepted into law, people are given a chance to view and challenge the published results and because they are completely public they can do so with a little more faith than they would have otherwise.
Sure, people could attempt voted fraud, but at least we would have a chance to catch them and an opportunity to fix it without throwing another few hundred million dollars on an election - a new voting event could be posted and people could use their already signed keys.
The idea isn't that we just blindly obey what the system kicks out, the idea is that if we need to challenge results or methods everything is open to us and we can do so anonymously, pointing out voting irregularities with access to real data without exposing ourselves to the people who would cause those irregularities.
The idea is that one system works for every system of voting, of all sizes, for all countries, whether it is first past the post, additional member system, single transferable vote, etc.
That way each country can run itself the way it sees fit while benefiting from group security.
It allows democracy to spread virally from the countries where the system is running to the countries where it isn't by way of unofficial elections - a feature I think is sadly missing from the alternative solutions I have seen where the idea is basically Bitcoins are now votes and each country runs its own alt coin.
My biggest problem just now is that there are a lot of competing ideas and I've little to no support for my version - on one hand I'm not accustomed to discussing unfinished work, on the other hand without significant public support there would be no point in dedicating my time to this, I want to hear from people.

Your computer can verify transactions now, and full clients do even if you aren't mining. When you install Bitcoin qt, it verifies every transaction that ever occured. 
Blocks include transaction data but mining isn't solving or verifying transactions, it is finding a nonce that when hashed with the block produces a hash that meets the difficulty.
That means trying a lot of hashes to find the right one.
Once it is found it is computationally trivial by comparison to verify the nonce does meet the difficulty because you only need to test one - full clients do this before accepting blocks from miners.

Lost coins are gone forever, the remaining coins are infinitely divisible so we don't run out.
Most things favour early adopters, you are still very early today. You can't hoard things indefinitely or they have no value to you.
It isn't for us to handle rural areas - they'll have internet there long before the cities are all Bitcoin users.
People who don't use internet won't use Bitcoin just like they don't use email. 100% adoption would be an ambitious goal anyway.
Not all clients need a copy of the blockchain, they can get information from online services that do it for them.
The lag is generally much better and you don't need to wait for 6 confirmations. Also, as banks issue credit cards they can provide 'green addresses' for their customers, as long as McDonald's trusts the bank they don't need to wait, it would be as quick as credit cards.

Most people are used to money systems lacking equality.
The only barrier to mining is money, most traditional forms of advancement involve nepotism.
ASICs are useful for mining Bitcoin and that's it. Miners had to invest that money without being guaranteed any return.
@_date: 2013-08-21 21:46:02
That's the solution I settled on too - the customer facing machine doesn't ever need access to private keys, just access to a pool of public keys it can use.
I'm using a Raspberry Pi to run as the link between websites and wallets - the Rasberry Pi runs a full client, generates a pool of keys, checks websites to keep them supplied with new keys and if it sees a payment it tells the website.
It saves on polling for updates having the server get back to you.
I'd be surprised if you couldn't find a wallet with watch addresses you could use, I'm surprised they haven't got back to you. There isn't much competition because everyone likes them so much.

If they think it is a joke, do you really believe they would understand the gravity of stealing it?
No one has friends they don't trust steal from them, everyone thinks of their friends and family like you do until an action proves them wrong.
Now, learn to be pissed, learn to like the evidence. You need to drop the emotive if you ever hope to find the truth. I mean it. You wouldn't be the first husband who's wife left them bankrupt, the first child to have their parents steal from them or the first parent to have their children steal from them. You wouldn't be the first person who's sibling or cousin stole from them.
Stop feeling.


That means it is likely someone else could have seen it.
Who were you with at that time?
Who has had access to your phone?
What kind of phone?
Now, don't lie to me, what illegal or pirated things have you possibly installed onto your phone?
What possibly illegal or pirate content have you visited or downloaded on the PC you use to access your wallet?
Now you've gotten over that, I got bored following the money but it distributed itself fairly quickly in a seemingly random fashion - since actual randomness doesn't look random, I would say it is more likely something automated that moves money after stealing it and tries to make it look random. I mention this last because if I say it first a normal person would fixate on it and think because they believe it is more likely they can ignore the other questions.

There are mixing services or you could trade the coins for cash anonymously and you would think you were tracking the original theif but actually they've past through 9 individuals and 4 companies since you started watching them and there is no link to the person who actually took them.
The same would be true of someone broke into your online banking and managed to withdraw funds in cash from a cash machine.
That cash is gone.
Eventually I would hope for the same thing that we have with standard banks - that is, you trust a company to hold your wallet for you because they are insured against theft and even though you lose the coins, they get replaced.

Roughly one confirmation every 10 minutes just like every other transaction - if you are waiting on the coins to return to you, it is wasted time.
Here's the thing - I just opened Bitcoin QT - the address book doesn't have a default address for "Sending Bitcoins" - that means you added that yourself, if you aren't seeing the funds in Bitcoin QT then that address is not yours.
The address book is where you put other people's addresses - since you appear to have just given money away to a random person in your address book, that money is now completely gone unless you can ask the owner of that address to give it back.
You can either paste the address here as you've been asked to do so we can work out between us what the hell you did or you can remember who you called "Sending Bitcoin" (have you used an address book before?!) on your own.

Especially now there are no exchanges in the UK where I live, I would have loved to have started one, but I fear the paperwork and legal requirements are beyond me.
A lot of developers seem to have gone with the "if I can make it technically function so that pressing these buttons moves money between the right accounts then I have a business" and forgotten to take care of the paperwork.
With the death of exchanges Bitcoin's ability to be traded for local currencies has been greatly harmed.
Yes there is Local Bitcoins but come on - do you really want to hand over thousands of your hard earned to a stranger on the internet? Even if you don't get robbed, it feels sketchy. People aren't used to trading like this.

When banks traded in actual gold and coins they did fine.
In a Bitcoin based bank they would have to have the money they lend.
They'd start off with an investment, loan it out, make profit, loan that out.
We could still have bitcoin saving banks where you store your coins in a bank's wallet, they guarantee your transactions so you don't have to wait for confirmations, they take all the unused money and invest it, loan it out, etc and you get interest.

They are fucking useless.

I get the impression because you think you need to read the code at all, a complicated program written in a language you don't know.
I get the impression because you think the current implementation is flawed but believe you need to read the code to know how to fix it.
Truth is you only need to know how it works, not why.
If you aren't intending to personally change the code yourself reading it is a fool's errand - you only need to be informed of how it works and you could do that with no programming knowledge at all by reading the wiki where the protocol is explained in depth.
You have no need to read the code, you only need to understand its operation in English if you are merely hiring someone to do the hard part.
You don't need to read the code to have an idea about what would make an alt coin superior.

He is right, if not very helpful or polite, it just can't be done.
Fyi - if a public key is invalid you can't send funds there, the software won't allow it, miners won't allow it and since it would be yours and there would be a valid address for that private key you could regenerate the address to get the right one.
If you reimported the private key by itself the wallet will calculate the corresponding address then you can check it matches.
Realistically if you validate the address that is enough to know whether there were any errors during generation because the checksum would stop it passing if any part of it was altered.   
Bonus - you can do this without exposing or importing the private key.

I can't link people here so they can read articles for information because they would never take Bitcoin seriously if they read some of the comments here.
I understand having a political leaning, but you have to be fairly crazy to think Bitcoin is technologically great enough to cause people to adopt your political ideology so that they can use it.

Sure, if they took over every mining pool or put a filter around those pools they could stop them publishing your transactions and you wouldn't be able to spend it.
This isn't very likely to put it lightly.
It is a little bit of a crazy question, it not only ignores how badly suited Bitcoin is for this but also how the current system does all that now.
They already have working mechanisms for freezing normal bank accounts, they don't need Bitcoin as a way to confiscate money.
Visa already prevented customers from donating to wikileaks.
They don't need chips or any crazy conspiracy gadget, the system we have does everything already.
Sure, there isn't a single currency, there doesn't need to be - it is just a red herring keeping people busy.

Most people who've owned a computer, laptop or modern games console will have had something break eventually.
I'd say even more people would attest that computers slow down with age.
It is much easier to believe than your believe that they will function at exactly the same speed forever.
I didn't say it would deteriorate. If one component will hit its breaking point and dies the card will just not work. Amongst the first things to go will be the fan, as it loses its ability to cool the device will run slower to compensate but even that too will break outright. When it does, your graphics card will cease to function.
Mining is strenuous and not really "normal usage" for these components who are not designed to be running the exact same task repetively at 100%, but to run lots of different tasks at much less. Just now my processor usage averages out at **0%** if you trust Task Manager to count it. Sometimes it goes to **1%**.

No it wouldn't compared with the cost of development.
I don't want to buy mining equipment from AMD if they are selling large quantities. They aren't BFL, they'd ship on time and everything at once.
Even if they completely outclassed the ASICs that came before them, there would be so many of them your share wouldn't give you a return on the money you spent.
Then the miners who lost out when they launched would develop something better and you'd start getting no money.
Consumer rights here give me 7 days to return online purchases even if there is nothing wrong with the product. All the people realising the graphics card isn't any good for mining would do the same. Everyone getting theirs at the same time means you could tell within those 7 days there would be no ROI.

"International" is what the UK calls a "Sensitive" business name and it requires the government approve it before you can use it - 
Mistakes happen, but if you look at the other thread (link in my other post) they are clearly prickly about revealing who they really are and the whole thing lacks a sense of professionalism - like keeping their identity hidden is more important than getting customers (the domain is not registered to a real person or address either) - given that they would be the only fish in the see if they really had Script ASIC hardware, all they need to do to be successful is convince people they aren't a scam - so far, not a single person.
They litterally sell money making machines, if you really have the hardware you can't screw that up!

Run the numbers again, producing a large illegitimate chain is not easy and even if it was it would be pointless.
A government or organization would need to invest millions and they would get nothing back. As soon as they successfully proved they were capable of a network takeover Bitcoin's value dies and they cannot recover the money they spent.
It would be an outright investment in closing the Bitcoin network. No government wants to throw money away like that, no company is going to spend millions on equipment it can't even resell to kill Bitcoin.

What we have now is people in power with a personal interest in retaining it.
I've no interest in continuing anything indefinitely, I want to enable change. If you want to reduce and reform government you have to move away from what we have now - politicians won't vote their own jobs away.
Nothing stays the same, time conquers all enemies - giving everyone equal power is the next step that allows us to move away from a system with power over people.
You'll never achieve that from a standing start, politicians and their friends are too heavily invested in what they've got now.

That isn't verifying it is correct - eg: making sure they are spending money that is theirs, making sure a given block has the right amount of coins in the Coinbase - though miners will verify every transaction they include, they do it for their own sake so that they don't waste their time solving a block the rest of the network will reject.
It is not what mining is or what mining does.
Miners could include invalid transactions or allocate themselves too much Bitcoin and as a result verifying blocks is done by all full clients to keep them honest.
While it is true that the deeper into a chain a transaction is (confirmations) the harder it is to produce an alternative chain that reverses that transaction, that isn't verifying the transaction - that is checking that the transaction has aged enough to be considered final so you can act upon it in good faith.
If mining was what verified transactions, miners could give the rest of the network invalid blocks. We don't trust miners, they are not an authority - they operate within a set of rules that all clients make them adhere to by verifying each transaction and the proof of work supplied by miners is correct.
The miners are not in charge of validating blocks and transactions, everyone else is - it is just in their interest to produce blocks the network will accept.
Both are important but they aren't the same thing.

You would pay for that much server bandwidth from a host.
@_date: 2013-08-04 20:00:31
Tor traffic is distinctive.
Tor traffic only goes 3 hops.
The NSA monitors the network.
If you visit a known website 1,000 times at different times of day, you will get a pattern of nodes involved in Tor traffic around the time those 1,000 requests were made.
As some people turn their computers off, you can eliminate some of them because they won't have been involved in every request.
As Tor has 3 hops by default, you can eliminate the nodes that didn't relay any requests during the 30 second (for arguments sake, damn Tor is slow!) period you made those requests or that were already relaying traffic before you made the request and therefor those requests can't be the target request, etc.
You end up with a slimmed down list of potential nodes that could be the host.
Then you look at the quantity of traffic for each node in that list - given that particular host accounts for a lot of Tor websites they will have a lot more traffic than average users because they will be involved in every request for every website they host, where most users will only be involved in a fraction of that because the 3 hops rule means they wouldn't need to.
If you cross reference the "people always involved in requests for this website" and the "high Tor users" I bet you end up with quite a short list.
Then you can monitor each one closely to correlate with requests you are making to the servers they hide, though depending on the quantity of traffic it is possible this host was just top of the most traffic list.
They can also add their own nodes to the network so they have a better idea of what is being transmitted.

Lets say the digitised copies know where the book starts, the script would then index the pages.
Then it would have to create lists of the first word from every page of each book, then the second word etc.
Then from those lists it would need to try the brain wallet for the first three words in each list, the first four words in each list, etc.
It would take quite some time(I think it could be gotten down to a few months) but you only need to create each key once and you can check the balances periodically.
If your advice catches on your specific brain wallet may never be found but plenty of other people won't be so lucky.

He had good ideas that failed the test of pressure and execution.
We can take those ideas and build on them.
While you should pay your respects to the previous generations because your achievements are built on their shoulders, your shouldn't build their pedestals too high - you should plan to be their successors.
Now that we have learned through experience that there is a limit to how much weight one person can bare and seen how getting to that person can collapse the market it is time to take those lessons and do better.
We can build something no one can control. Removing the temptations is the best way to.deal with the human problem and the government problem.

What does that sentence mean?
If you know who the buyer is, you know what he looks like from his ID, you know what time you should be looking at.
You could start by verifying he met ANYONE at Starbucks, sure he could have met his friend and not the OP so it doesn't prove the buyer right, but it could very well prove him wrong if he doesn't show up at all.
If the OP's story is that no one showed up and if you can get a camera angle that proves the buyer never came through the door, case closed.
You should at least be able to verify the presence of the buyer or the OP - hell, maybe you watch the tape and both arrive but never actually talk to each other.
Anything less and despite how uncredible the OP's story is your service can't be trusted to resolve disputes, actually looking at evidence is the minimum anyone could ask you to do and if you aren't going to bother with it then your service serves no function especially since up until now it seems like everything else you have accepted as evidence you have done so on the false believe that it would be difficult to fake.

Given that:
they refused to post their address (check the other thread -  ) until they were approved by Bitpay,
refused two offers of a physical visit to confirm they had stock (when they clearly need someone within the community to say something nice about them),
registered the domain without using their business address,
lifted an image and specs from another site and still got it wrong,
claims to have hardware now but won't release pictures,
stopped replying to posts really quickly when it would have been super easy to reasure people if they aren't full of shit,
they claim they can afford to develop a Scrypt ASIC without collecting preorder money but used wordpress to "keep costs down",
use a company name they likely aren't legally allowed to,
and their maths seem suspicous:


Something comparative to 230GB of GDDR5.
It would require 25,000 Watts (at least) to run a 7950-based comparative rig. - 
I'm going to say this one is busted.
They didn't even need to think of a way to prove they were legit, they had people litterally offering to drive to them.
The UK is a tiny country, I know that there is no part of it I couldn't drive to tomorrow and to get my hands on the very first scrypt mining rig in existance before anyone else I would have gladly done so. 
The only reason for them not to take that offer is that they can't deliver - it is a lot easier rip random people off online than it is to rip of techies face to face, techies that know what they are looking at, are going to want to see it run and are going to want to see the 100s of other units you claim to have before they tell the world that you aren't a con man.

If I could get you to read my other post, I give some details on how it could eventually be used to vote on specific issues. I've not had any feedback at all yet and I'd welcome it.
The way I see it - using government signed keys, official and unofficial votes could be held by the government for no additional cost after the inital key signing which would be part of the standard election cost.
That way, the government could have people vote on issues just to get feedback from them - they may not go with the majority, but it gives them easier access to the information in a secure and verifiable form.
Just now there is no "reuse" of security protocols, which makes referendums like this expensive, as verification is done during the begining of each election cycle (though each government could do it whenever they chose to, the protocol would not care) those signed keys can be reused for almost nothing to conduct further secure elections.
Almost free referendums.
Compare that to this:


I believe my solution will reduce the cost of elections. Although you still need to be verified in the same way, turning up to "receive" your ballot (in this case, get your key signed), I have revolutionised every part of the process after this.
It reduces the cost of vote counting to next to nothing, it reduces the cost of transfering and paying security to protect the votes to next to nothing.
My solution is also nearly free to reuse, as apposed to the current system which costs just as much again to use a second time.
I think cost is a big part of the current system - if it costs over $100 million to ask 1 question to a country the size of the UK, asking potentially dozens of questions every day to say America, Russia or China would be huge!
It would not be affordable to give people the opportunity to weigh in on each issue with an individual vote under the current system - my solution makes it possible.
That is how I see the middle step - to begin with, it will be used to query the public but ultimately their decision wouldn't be binding or meangingful.
It would operate in parallel to the official government stance as a measure of how well the people are truly being represented until eventually it took over.
I think in some countries the people would just start holding elections and honoring the results, regardless of the current regime which only has the power assigned to it.

I certainly didn't use the word expert.
The theory of cryptography is seperate from its implementation in any specific language - just like 2+2 always equals 4 when you write it like that or say it outloud in French.
Unless you plan to continue with programming you can skip straight to crypto theory - especially if that is where your interests are.
You will find it more rewarding and you won't miss out knowing by not knowing any particular programming language.
Sure, it would mean you couldn't build it yourself but unless that's your goal (you didn't say it was) you won't be losing out on anything you wanted.

From where I stand - if you don't understand the process what you said can be read as "if someone wanted to add code, it would just be added".
I saved a web page as an HTML file once while showing the owner what they needed to fix, I edited it locally and showed them the changes. It was one line of code. They didn't understand that wouldn't change the real site.
While the Bitcoin community seems to have a high number of technically capable users we can't just assume everyone is as knowledgable. We need to be gentler.
The steps you missed out are where people who don't understand Open Source development practices will find peace of mind.
Without those steps in the process, what you said just sounds really scary.
"Anyone can add code" isn't true because it is far more complicated than that, there are barriers to entry including getting it past review. It isn't perfect or full proof, but a system of imperfect review is surely orders of magnitude better than one with no review and no recourse?
There are people who would believe that if you download the code and change it, the code is just changed. Right there and then, for everyone - I worry about their takeaway. If you say "anyone can change the code" and don't explain the process, people will believe it.
Are you one of those lucky people who don't have to deal with customers who've never seen a line of code outside of the movie Swordfish?
I've enjoyed this, but I have to bow out and give up - this has got far too confrontational (and I accept all the blame that's coming to me for that).
I think we'd both achieve better things on the same side, I hope to see you around.

They are providing a way to use some hardware optimizations to speed up sha hashes on cpus rather than making a device specifically for hashing ie. An ASIC.
It won't likely make cpu mining profitable, it isn't really Bitcoin news, it is more for finely tuned software that would benefit from a small improvement - mining Bitcoin needs a huge improvement.

Note to self, bring a contract when dealing with strangers.
    I {sellers name} wish to sell {goods here} using the payment method bitcoin.
    
    I am asking {amount in BTC} which I value at {amount in your curreny(so that if the price of bitcoin
    changes and it goes to court, you are arguing over the original amount and not the exchange rate)} to
    be paid from {buyers address} into my account {sellers address}
    
    Signed: {Seller}
    Signed: {Buyer}
Print two copies.
As the addresses are printed and signed and the transaction information is public, it is trivial to prove you paid them.
It doesn't matter that bitcions aren't fiat currencty, it would still hold up if it went to court, at least here in the UK.

I'm not missing the point.
You can attempt to mine Bitcoins with any computer, however, a Bitcoin Mining Machine is really their dolt way of refering to things build specifically to do only that - ASICs.
If you were selling a normal computer, you wouldn't have a problem - we are talking purpose built machines being marketed specifically as a way to produce Bitcoin or taking machines that were built for that specific purpose and trying to pretend it wasn't.
You can't call an ASIC a "gaming machine". It really is a Bitcoin Mining Machine - you cannot game on an ASIC. 
Given the internal message specifically says to make sure people have the equiment and are not selling preorders and given that Butterfly Labs is famous for not fulfilling preorders and given that people tried to sell their preorders on Ebay, this is not a coincidence.
Sure, you can sell your old computers that you used as a mining rig as just a computer but as far as selling things capable of mining go, long term this is a discussion about ASICs, not just computers that you happen to install mining software on to.

They had to install the Javascript on the servers so that it would be sent to users when they visited the site and their browsers would execute it.
They did this after tracking down the host.
We are now discussing how they tracked down the host when their servers were supposed to be anonymous, as we are only guessing at this point, I am guessing they rented a server from the same company they were trying to track down so they could run server side code to reveal the location of the host.
After tracking down the host, the sites they hosted started serving the Javascript exploit - but before that, they had to find out where the host was.

It takes 10 minutes for miners to solve a block, not to propagate.
A block is a collection of transactions, though unconfirmed transactions are broadcast by themselves so miners can include them in blocks.
Propagation is a lot quicker than 10 minutes.
The 10 minute time was chosen as a balance between security and lowering the likelyhood two miners solve blocks simultaneously.
A lower target time means more miners finding blocks at the same time which means you have to wait for more confirmations(blocks built on top of that block) to be certain a block won't be replaced by another chain.

Well, the idea of a reverse green address, where customers can send money without a fee is interesting but it reverses the flow of trust.
The company is now responsible for ensuring the integrity of money sent to them and it isn't more secure overall and requires a lot of parties to join in.
In the end it is wasted energy over just asking someone to pay the fee.
For most small transaction you can keep an eye out for broadcast doublespends and be fine with one confirmation.
I have a slightly different idea.
A service where you register your receiving addresses and it monitors your senders for doublespend attempts, gives you a threat rating outside of number of confirmations and insures the transactions you receive so that if the payment is reversed in some fashion after they tell you it is safe they cover some or all of the transaction.
It could also make a directed effort to inform the swarm about transactions to you before they get included in blocks to increase the chance that it does - this can be done now without cooperation from.anyone else.
Having the fee sent with the payment is the most efficient method currently, a lot more than this way.
Why shouldn't customers pay the fee? It isn't like it is hard, most software does it automatically.

They aren't just chained ASICs, they are connected to other components (that are not ASICs) that can do more. If this was part of the definition of being a computer, we would still be safe. As it turns out it is not.
Yes, the ASICs are specialised, yes, that means while our super computer can double sha256 faster than any other super computer there will still be some tasks our super computer can be beaten at by "smaller" super computers.

Mining is not "voting on the order of transactions" because the person who finds the block gets absolute authority.
The rest of the people mining aren't "voting" for him - if anything, they are voting against.
The people accepting the block as "correct" are not "voting" they are verifying the proof of work is accurate.
There is also a luck aspect to mining - the people with the most power will see steady returns, but smaller fish can get lucky occassionally.
Chains are kept by a consensus when two blocks get mined by different people in succession but that is not voting either. They aren't collaborating on what they think *should* happen, they are recounting the history as they saw it.
Bitcoin does not have a method of allowing people to make decisions based on how much money they own nor should it.
As a small percentage of people control most of the traditional wealth, it is safe to assume Bitcoin will not be any different.
By letting the few people who have the most money make all the decisions we are establishing a new central authority.

I have been working on "a" solution and I believe it is almost possible and that although not perfectly trustless, it is a substitute for what we have now - the current system isn't trustless, there are several points in the process where we give people and organisations trust. I can think of ways to get rid of most of them, but currently I am left with one group of people I cannot replace with technology and I think that is okay.
Currently, here at least, you turn up to vote and your name gets ticked off a list and you get 1 ballot paper.
Those people are the only ones I want to keep but I can get rid of the people making the ballots, printing them, transporting them and counting them, it still leaves some trust in the hands of the people handing out the ballot papers - the exact same job we already trust them with now, but in a decentralised system there is the increased ability to audit their actions so although we still have to trust them just the same we can better keep tabs on them.
My take so far:
Instead of giving you one ballot paper, you give them one public key (whether or not they record which key will depend on local laws and doesn't really matter to the P2P network - it may matter to your ideology) and they sign it with their own key.
Their key is specific to the person signing for audit purposes and in turn is signed by the organisation that authorises them to be there.
You now have one signed public key to which you have the private key and you cannot go and request multiple keys get signed because they ticked your name off the list. That's as difficult as the process would be for the average person in the end.
That key isn't used for voting directly - but from there on I think you'll be able to guess enough of the rest to see the answer to your question - how can we ensure only one vote per person.
There are additional checks you can then do based on that initial signing event for peace of mind too.
By releasing all the keys signed (without names) you can check that all the votes counted in an election were authorised by the correct organisation and you can make sure they didn't sign any extra people's keys - if the official voter roll says 2,000 people signed up and 3,000 keys were signed we sack the people in charge, investigate them for fraud and start over. We will of course know which individual signed more keys than anyone else because the key they sign with is personal to them and that function.
That gives you a list of signed keys, a list of votes, a list of keys that voted.
You can disregard votes cast by anyone who's key wasn't authorised to vote and you can tally all the votes cast by people who were.
The solution I ended up with is a little more complicated than that because:
Although users can 100% verify their vote was cast properly, was counted in the final results and was counted towards the correct party/candidate/issue it also has to be impossible for a given user to prove to anyone how they voted to anyone else.
From the comfort of their own home I want them to be able to bring up the list of votes cast, who they were for, look at their vote, know that it is 100% their vote and that it was counted properly and still not be able to prove they haven't picked any old random vote and claimed it as their own to anyone else.
The voter will know they are telling the truth, which is good enough to audit their own vote (if everyone does that, we are good, right!?) but they won't have evidence they can give to anyone else to prove it.
If all you did was have people sign a vote with a given private key, they can prove a vote was theirs by signing something else with that key.
Therefore, I have designed it so that although you can be 100% sure in yourself about your own vote you don't have tangible evidence to give to anyone else to back your claim. This prevents vote selling, extortion, tracking voters by the NSA, etc.
Other people have suggested encrypting votes but I don't like that because you end up requiring an organisation or collection of organisations or person or group of people who's job it is to decrypt votes and publish the results and you have to trust them. There are lots of clever suggestions about it requiring a collective of people rather than a real "authority" to decrypt the results, etc, but I really want the network to carry the truth in plain sight. I don't want it to require 10,000 users simultaneously agreeing to reveal the results together I want everyone to be able to check the results and know how it turned out for themselves, by themselves.
I like what Bitcoin does for openness so I want to avoid compromising on that.
Other people have also suggested allowing fake votes, so if someone tries to extort you or offers to buy your vote, you can add extra votes to the network that won't be counted in the final results.
I don't like that, again, it outsources trust in a part of the system I want to keep open - vote counting.
If you can fool people with fake votes then it requires an authority that knows which votes are fake and which aren't and we have to trust them to tell us which are which. (And it fills the network up with junk data)
I didn't want anyone to be in charge of publishing or counting the results or decrypting the results so I have gone another way.
I also like what Bitcoin does with the software side of things.
I can program my own, independent Bitcoin client and run it on my own computer or phone, connect to the network, move my money, check I received money, and I am not a security risk to the network and it is not a security risk to me.
That is not possible with the current implementations of voting machines - you have to use their machines, their websites. It is one thing releasing code and promising that *THIS* voting machine really uses that exact code. It is another compiling your own code.
Even if most people don't, what is represented by the ability to do it is important to me.
When I started, I had some things I wanted the network to do.
Voters (or non voters) should be able to do the following using ONLY publicly available information(no false votes, no decryption, no other people required at all):
* Count all the votes cast.
* Verify that the total includes their vote.
* Verify that their vote is counted towards whatever they voted for.
Since then I have added:
* Voters should not be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt to a third party how they voted
* It should not be possible to link how a person voted on one issue with how they voted on another(ie: if you only used one key for all your votes, you could say "this person voted 'yes' on this election but 'no' on this other election" - even if you couldn't say anything else about them. It prevents datamining to influence groups that can be tracked. This isn't a problem now but it could become a problem in the future otherwise.
Obviously, the normal rules with voting were always assumed:
* The ability to restrict the number of times each person can vote - in most cases that number would be 1, but there are other voting systems I wanted to be compatible with where 1 person may vote more than once.
* Votes shouldn't be modifiable after they are cast
* It shouldn't be possible to counterfeit votes
* It should not be possible to look at votes cast and identify the voter

Some serious brain power was thrown at this at a minimum - worst case scenario however is that the bug was deliberately added to Firefox so that it could be exploited.
I see this, I see the NSA, I see trying to filter porn in the UK and I don't feel safe.
I know that I haven't done anything but work and use Reddit so they won't come for me, but they will come for all the developers who make things that offer me potential security. By the time other people like me notice the writing on the wall the net will already be closed and there will be no way to do anything without it being monitored.

A few thousand more and I will be able to finance a more robust replacement to the Silk Road.
Unfortunately I think in the meantime we will see Silk Road clones from people who think there was no parallel construction going on and who believe they can avoid DPR's mistakes because there is massive amounts of money to be made as a king pin.
I also suspect honey pots from letter agencies looking to capture the demand the Silk Road no longer fills. Or maybe the CIA sets up in that market just for the profits, wouldn't be the first time.
I think DPR will be an important historical figure and there will be an interesting trial.

Personally, at this stage in the game selling a course on Bitcoin mining like it is something attainable by an individual without deep pockets is unethical. 
You wouldn't be teaching a skill of value, you'd be convincing high school kids to get into debt and waste money on equipment they won't see a return on.

Being able to take a stolen, traceable credit card that is very risky to spend because anything physical will have to come to you and anything virtual can be confiscated and trade that for untraceable Bitcoin is the holy grail of credit card theft.
Any credit card thief anywhere in the world would be lucky to find such a service.

As for people trying to scam exchanges by filing false chargebacks - sure the blockchain is public, if you think the bank is going to look at it you are crazy.

Not in the same location, a random spot check shuts them down.
What you end with is seperate legal and illegal brothels and John's having to knowingly use an illegal brothel with no STD certification instead of ones that are safe - that slashes the customer base. Cash rewards for information relating to finding them - that makes it risky to find customers, punishments for using and running them and legal alternatives make running a successful illegal brothel more difficult.
I think it would result in girls being trafficked to other countries where the laws are still backwards because the business is still mobile.

Agreed - most people don't need large sums of money in Bitcoin, especially for it to be useful.
An exchange should probably start with low limits regardless of the local laws because look at how swamped and behind all the existing exchanges are - "You are 60,000 in the queue", MtGox.
Even though Bitstamp moved their registered address to the UK they use a foreign bank acccount so I still need to complete several steps that are unnecassary (and not actually listed on their site) to send them money.
The exchanges we have now are not geared towards how normal consumers shop and that makes them useless for anyone outside the Bitcoin echo chamber.

I'm sorry I can't help more.
I realise it has parallels with Bitcoin but by definition that means the paths don't cross.
Bitcoin is secured by a network consensus that won't allow money to be spent if you don't own them.
Paper money relies on a hard to duplicate pattern/design that can only be made by the government.
No one is spending casascius coins, they are collecting them because they can only be safely used 1 time. No good for real money. You also have to trust the company put the private keys on the coins but didn't keep them. 
Anything you make on a commercially available printer can be copied by another.
You don't have the ability to stop duplication and you've no way to verify authenticity. 
I keep trying to think of workarounds but it comes back to being the wrong tools.

You want anonymous you buy from a miner or mine - Bitcoin is psuedoanonymous, it was never designed to dodge the law but to provide a way to guarantee the transfer of value between two people who don't know each other with low transaction fees and no central authority with the power to veto transactions.
That doesn't negate the fact that companies dealing with bank transfers, wiretransfers, etc will want to know who you were. Bitcoin isn't supposed to prevent that.

There is no serious conversation to be had about re-inventing Bitcoin as a centralised currency.
My first post wasn't serious but it was far from malicious.
Having stupid ideas is part of having ideas, I said that in my reply already.
If anything I nursed him towards the idea that a bad idea does not make a bad person.
I did not judge him based on what having the idea said about him - though I will judge him on how quickly he decided to call me a faggot.
While I stayed away from judging people despite how unhappy you both are, both of you failed there. You decided you were fit to judge me - that's where you both went after I said "it's a terrible idea, don't worry, everyone has those".

To be honest they just came up fairly highly in Google, it really shouldn't matter who you use to push the transaction to the netowrk because they are signed and the worst they can do is not publish it at all.
Inputs.io also offer the same service - 
I've seen it a few places offering it and I love what it does for staying anonymous. You could put a signed transaction on a USB key, post it to someone and have them broadcast it.
Sure, it would not be fast, but it shows how difficult it is to prevent a Bitcoin transaction reliably - signing can be done offline and broadcasting can be done in another country. You wouldn't wait that long for a McDonalds but you might wait that long for a few thousand dollars worth.

If you did that right there is no link between your identity and online payments, they couldn't get a warrant because nothing points to you personally and if they did you wouldn't be keeping a list of historical illegal transactions for your accountant.
There's no reason to change wallet, there's an obvious case for deleting things you don't want found.
Maybe keep two wallets if you can't mentally seperate them but you get nothing from cycling clients for the sake of it except it won't be long before you've used them all once so you better hope none have bugs.

A lot of that rely on insurance companies - the biggest dick heads after politicians, bankers and lawyers are insurance companies.

Hell, you will be lucky if being shot isn't a prexisting condition.
They have Bitcoin, you can't seize it.

They aren't registered somewhere, they operate outside of that frame work and they target people who can't afford legitimate protection.

Actually, you can configure the transaction fee.
It may be payable to the network, but you still choose to pay it.
Yes, if you want your transactions processed in a timely manner, you will choose to pay it, however (100% - transaction fee) != 100% just because there is no money left in the account.
He will be receiving less than 100% of what he gave you.

It isn't just adding the meta tag - software would need to support it.
Unlike the bitcoin link that was recently added to the spec, this would take an extra button AND effort to find it.
Either: The page itself hassles you about how they have their donation information in the page header and you can do x then y then z to pay them money, in which case they should have just put the donation information on the page, where everyone can see it or your browser would have to inplement something to tell you about the meta tag.
That means that would mean that your browser now has to display something somewhere to let you know you can tip the author of this page or you have to go through a bunch of menus.
This seems a step backwards from displaying it on the page which would work for everyone.

It feels late in the game, especially when I look at mining. It'd take a big investment to get in and with ASICs shipping and orders backlogged it is a risk that the difficulty would be too high before I got it.
Then I look at all the things Bitcoin can do but doesn't (Mike Hearn gave a talk that's on Youtube, I think you'd like it) and I look at how many people even know its name and I realise I'm incredibly early. 
Bitcoin has two immediate needs, more reliable exchanges and software that is capable of everything Bitcoin is.

It is called Litecoin. You are wrong to say it doesn't allow ASICs - mostly its is supposed to combat GPU mining, there just have not been one built yet. They would be more expensive to build a Scrypt ASIC but not impossible.
It is not possible to "disallow" hardware in this manner.
You think people are going to go back to CPU mining for you? The whole advantage of ASICs is that they are very efficient with regards to power consumption. They also fend off attacks from those who have a lot of normal PC's who would turn them against the network.


I think it will fail because you are executing it, not because the idea itself is bad. You may have a winning idea but just like my awesome idea for a skateboard trick but if I can't execute it no one will care.
Your idea may be a winning one, feel free to share it.


If you don't know your idea, you don't have an idea, you don't have anything.
I'm critiquing you personally at this point - your experience is not enough to carry this through, as evidenced by things you've already said, including the following:


Because THAT is how programming works - you have ideas THEN you program them.
I don't start with code, I start on PAPER.


No, the theory of programming is such that an idea can be proven workable or unworkable before you start writing code - in a lot of cases, the architecture can be worked out without choosing a language first as most languages enable most things.
This is why I believe you cannot execute the idea, regardless of what it is.
The point isn't to argue about the idea, the point is to argue about your ability and what would be required of you to succeed.
The point is making you realise that not only do you not have the required skills, you aren't willing to put in the work required to obtain them.

Satisfied sounds like another word for finished and there is no "skipping to the end", there are only the parts between the begining and the end.

No, they have other complex processes to make sure you don't withdraw from 10 cash machines in different countries at once before their network registers the payment and to make sure no one intercepts your credit card number because they could start spending with it - a process that includes auditing all software and websites that use credit cards as well as the hardware and electricity cost , google PCI DSS Compliance.
Their processes include other data Bitcoin find useless, such as your IP Address when you buy things online or details about the cash machine you use or the details you entered on the form of the website to verify your ID.
Both the merchant, the merchant provider and the card issuer stores all the data about each transaction, the address you used, whether you past CV2, verified by visa (which does transmit arbitrary data - it uses a challenge/response system with an encryption and signing layer), the card number, the security code, all need handled and past around and confirmed by each stage.
Even still, they have to profile the data and make maps of your normal spending patterns so they can flag fraud, they have to physically make new cards for you if yours gets stolen or lost and secure the manufacture and transport of it.
They have to store everyone's personal details and credit card numbers - this isn't done once, this is done hundreds of times so they can cope with power outages.
Credit card terminals are dedicated computers to just read the data on those cards, transmit it over the network and have it verified at the other end.
They need to oversee everyone's balance and spending.
They have to encrypt their data because someone with your credit card number can use it - their encryption needs to run on their servers, the website you buy from, your computer, cash machines and chip and pin terminals. All of which use extra power because of the encryption.
Their encryption accounts for more wasted power than the Bitcoin network that doesn't need encryption for the data it transports because the secrets all happen inside your wallet. 
Encryption is an arbitrary problem CPUs have to solve.
All that https traffic needs both sides to do it, you just don't see it because they spread the load thinner and possibly because you haven't been exposed to the inner workings of it. 
You think Bitcoin is inefficient because you have been told a little bit about it - if you looked at standard transactions with half the scrutiny you would see twice the wastage.

Unfortunately technology doesn't always favour the best solution.
Look at email spam.
I first heard about Proof of Work, the thing that protects Bitcoin, a DECADE ago on Slashdot.
It was proposed as an add on to email, essentially you would need to calculate proof of work for each email you send.
It would have snubbed spam. People don't notice their zombie pc sending emails, they would notice them mining.
It would have made hosted Botnets thousands of times less profitable.
Did we ever end up including it in SMTP? NO.
In fact SMTP was made when few trusted people were online - although your email provider may require one, SMTP itself DOES NOT require a password or authentication to send email.
It is possible to send email from anyone no questions asked.
It is still in use because it gained traction.

Bitcoin right now is technically complex. So was the internet in its fourth year, if you expect today's reality to be tomorrow's you are crazy. It takes time to build an infrastructure and user friendly software but it is incredibly short sighed to act like it won't happen.
Satoshi Dice is one Bitcoin user, it has thousands of customers to pay them Bitcoin.
Calling it a niche does not change anything, all companies need customers.
Consumers - thousands.
Satoshi Dice - one.
See? 
Satoshi Dice is proof that consumers outnumber the service providers.
Satoshi Dice is successful because there are lots of customers willing to use it.
You can't run services in an economy where providers outnumber consumers, you can't aim a currency at service providers because they'll have no one to sell to.
Saying Bitcoin's audience is the provider is utter nonsense, economies need a mix of consumers and service provides, nothing works without both.

I have no idea what is typical but I have several USB keys that no longer work.
I like this -  - it is actually far easier and cheaper than you would think, it can be done on scraps of metal if you really need to.
There are other methods of chemical etching that would work as well as the one above, I would prefer the one with harsher chemicals but no power supply since that's easier for me to do.
Since the indents are in the metal itself you are probably good your entire life and no big magnet could wipe it out, it may even withstand a fire.
The USB Keys should be fine as long as nothing happens to them, but if it was my life savings I wouldn't be stopping at "should be".

Of course you are supposed to disable Javascript when you use TOR, I'm not sure why it wasn't the default on TOR Browser originally.

If they concentrate their efforts they can catch some people, that means it is time to move on or improve it.
They may hate TOR because they can't identify everyone effortlessly with the rest of the web, but the fact that is that it functions like a bullet proof vest that only protects you by puting you in a crowd of people who might get shot instead.

Clients matter, not just miners. Miners can give themselves a thousand Bitcoin a block but no clients would accept it.
Either exchanges and merchants would upgrade or they wouldn't, it is unlikely to be a split long term because being able to spend and receive coins is the most important thing.
Anyone receiving money on the 5% fork runs the real risk exchanges won't take it and they won't be able to find another user who will so you wouldn't want to accep them as payment because they are valued at what you can get for them.
You are essentially accepting double spent coins that have no value
100% of 0 is 0. With no one mining the 5% fork transactions would stop but the difficulty would stay high, with 95% of the hash power gone it would be terribly slow and vulnerable to a 51% attack.
In the end the 5% would upgrade to keep their money.

The cookie isn't the exploit.
They add a cookie so that they don't waste processing power tracking the same user twice.
The exploit breaks out of Tor, early guesses by overflowing the JIT compiler, and connects to their server over clearnet bypassing Tor reporting your real IP address.
They only set the cookie so that they don't have to do it more than once, the cookie itself is not the exploit - it just marks you as "got this one already".

That's a smart question.
The signature is separate from the hash and is underneath - it proves the real developer signed those exact files in a similar way that you use a private key to sign Bitcoin transactions.

Your initial post mentioned precalculating transactions - not if the proof of work is compatible with what we use now.
This seems mostly like people would fail and waste their efforts more than they'd achieve anything, it seems wasteful.
If it generates coins outside of the 21 million it devalues all Bitcoin and if it generates coins inclusive of the 21 million it reduces the profitability of mining, which lowers the actual difficulty which compromises security.

The nonce is the number added to a block to make the hash for that block lower than the difficulty.
For a hash to work all outputs need to be just as likely.
That makes the nonce as likely to be odd than even.
Mining is testing nonces repeatedly until you find one where the hash is low enough, if it was predictable that would change the nature of mining.

I do not think the phrase 'publicly generated key' accurately describes any part of my idea.
There is a difference between distributing public keys and keys being publicly generated.
People are not given or assigned keys, they make their own and the authority signs the public key with theirs.
If people attempted to use the same key, the proof of work needs to be such that different people would get different solutions that distinguished them, allowing them all to be included in the results.
All the votes would only be counted as one vote and this is event can be detected. As the identity of the person who signed that key would be known the source can also be traced.
Another voting event could be published if it was decided it was warranted. 
As for government abuse - it is more secure because the government couldn't link people with their keys and they could if they issued them.
Ultimately, people in the government would still habe power to abuse but it would be transaparancy.
The example I gave I gave because of how closely it resembles the current system in the UK - people would only be able to abuse the powers that they already have and can abuse.
This is meant as a transitional step rather than an end goal.
Other countries will have their own transitional steps to make, I was just giving one example.

I'm also working on something similar.
How are you dealing with the ways different countries handle elections? 
Eg: some use first past the post, some single transferable vote, etc.
If the network can't handle a given country's election counting method then to use your system they'd have to change the way votes are handled and the way votes are counted at the same time - I think requiring a double change is a significant adoption barrier which is why I'm looking at a method agnostic network.
As a developer it is my job to enable people to function freely rather than to code my morality and require adoption.
This ties in with the granularity question but is different enough I don't feel it is a waste of your time to bother you with it.
This goes a lot further than allowing more choices than 'yes' and 'no' because there are dozens of ways to count the same set of results and the nodes and miners need to understand them to produce actual results. 
I'm also curious, worried and terrified by the phrase 'built onto the Bitcoin network', would you elaborate?

Bitcoin is the answer to Paypal. As consumers, when they cut off Wikileaks we were able to answer with Bitcoin which has the potential to dwarf Paypal's current value and to remove the usefulness of it.

The end goal might be, but you don't start a journey with the final step.
The less a solution prescribes a single method of operation the harder to shut down it will be.
If you mandate one mixing service because it is part of the market for example, if that mixing service is comprimised it would effect 100% of users and they would not be able to switch to an alternative - they would need to wait until the site switched.
Given that the site should be decentralised, you just centralised it by creating a decision maker who has the final say as to what mixing service is used and that defeats the purpose of decentralisation because if that person is corrupted or caught, we have a weakness that didn't need to be there.
If the market enables users to select their own mixing service, it will create a market for trust worthy escrow companies who will be able to operate in the open because they are not directly involved with a market that is in conflict with the laws of some countries.
In the begining that means there will only be a few people testing out the various options, but in the end it will allow the best solutions a platform and that freedom of choice is what will be best for the average Joe. Creating a market where you get to choose your own escrow company means that there will be a demand for trustworthy escrow companies.
If no one can vote with their feet they might put up with a less than excellent solution because the rest of the market is valuable to them.

Bitcoin addresses actually have parts, it isn't one long strong as it looks.
The end section contains a check hash, a hash of the rest of the address.
If you type a character wrong the hash won't match the rest of the address.
To type a valid address accidently would require a close address to one you have (a few mistakes max) with an almost identical hash.
This is nigh on impossible.
If the address isn't valid a client won't let you send coins there.
Tl;dr - Bitcoin protects against typos in the address.

The entire solution so far is 'just use Bitcoin', if I saw this going somewhere serious I would volunteer some more time but as it stands you don't have a solution, you've just added 'use Bitcoin' to the problem.
You want something reversible, medical records change.
You want something doctors can direct.
Just now you have permanently published results.
If you aren't using any of Bitcoin's features and your app bipasses any real access to the Bitcoin network you might as well develop your own data storage. You'll have as much luck getting doctors to sign up.
The problem is that your answer to not getting STDs is to have a doctor write you've no diseases on money, in the hope that other people will do it too. It isn't enough.

It isn't intuitive that way around, I agree with you - it is no good being able to type in fields that change after you've set a value, you could lock values in but it is a little painful.
A better solution is that you give people the option of a custom change address.
The custom change address would give two suboptions:
* Normal (what we have now) only transactions that would otherwise be partially spent go to the change adddress.
* All funds available and not spent in the transaction go to the change address.
They would enter
* Recipient
* Fee
* Change address
* Change address mode
* Total Spend *(Change address mode 1 only)*
Calculated fields:
* Amount sent to change address
* Amount left in wallet
* Total transaction value
Now your target transaction has a much simpler interface and the OP can empty his wallets to his heart's content while leaving his spending wallet with a nice round amount.
Obviously, when you are using change address mode 2, there is no need for a total field.
In mode 1, especially if collecting a lot of dust, changing the Total Spend may increase the transaction fee and if the transaction hits the rules on a requiring a transaction it would automatically lock or require that minimum. Editing the Total Spend edits the total that goes to the change address.
How's that?

The white paper says proof or work is *essentially* one cpu one vote compared to 1 IP Address per vote and is really an explanation of why that route wasn't taken. It is a simplified comparison of the two systems so that it is easy to understand and a statement on why 1 IP Address 1 vote is a bad idea rather than a philosophical mandate or technical specification.
It is comparitive.
Cpu power is almost irrelevant in Bitcoin today but the conclusion is a little more accurate, it says people vote with their cpu power - today's reality is people earn money relative to their hashing power, but most of the blocks mined are mined by pools making it one pool one vote.
The white paper came before Bitcoin - it was the seed but it isn't the tree, what we ended up with is far from one cpu one vote and with GPU mining and ASIC mining, although he saw the hardware arms race coming, I think Satoshi underestimated how driven people would be - that is why we were further through mining all of the Bitcoins than was predicted.

With the amount of money and persistence it would take to eliminate a distributed network like bitcoin we would be talking deep pockets.
Either a very large company or government.
I can't exactly see the American government saying "This alternative currency threatens our way of life, we should start a proxy war by sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to Russian gangs so that they'll do the fighting for us".
I think most governments would consider an attack of this magnitude an act of war when instituted by a foreign government and directed at servers within their own borders.
I think most companies large enough to pay for this sort of thing would likely have shareholders who would probably protest funding illicit entities.
Most Bank CEOs couldn't do this alone, hell, they probably couldn't even think it could be done on their own. They'd have to bring other people in, news would get out.

It also requires downloading 9GB of Blockchain to get the results.
If you don't think the bloat will be significant that means someone has to synchronise the whole blockchain to access a tiny part.
If the app provider syncs blockchain themselves so clients don't have to then results don't need published to the blockchain at all because the results are signed and the end user only uses the app which becomes a defacto authority and normal users won't know the data came from the blockchain.

You would probably want to make transactions to the game and have the game pay out players so it is aware of the transaction rather than direct player to player transactions because the game needs to change ownership of whatever you bought anyway. 
They get paid from their return microtransaction by the game.
That way the cash for sword deal can be guaranteed. Game gets payment, item changes hands, game pays out and game has a mechanism for commission.
Otherwise the game couldn't stop you taking payments and not forking over goods without human intervention which increases the cost of running it.
In game transactions of a reasonable size aren't spam and would be fine, they represent payments anyway. It's just the small, repeated, transactions you want to keep off the blockchain.

By your own admission you saw everyone else buying flash cars and doubling their money and you wanted in on that so much you were willing to risk your rent money even though everyone else told you, and everyone else with the same idea, that they would lose in the end.
Here you are, having lost, complaining it "feels like you got conned".
If someone told you to do something and you did it and lost your money, you could say you got conned.
When every single person says not to do something and you did it anyway and you lose your money, you do not get to say you got conned.
Jealousy, envy, greed.
Pick one, choose another - ultimately it doesn't matter why you did it, it matters that you did and you need to learn not to do it again.
Whatever you ultimately attribute your actions to, you will in time either learn that it wasn't sound judgement or continue to throw good money after bad.

Your post says they 'will' be included but that isn't true, they only *might* be included - they have to rely on luck, combined with the 3 other points that apply to you, you are a lottery unless you have a substantial argument regarding why those points don't in fact apply to you.

That's what is wrong with Tor.
It has a host or multiple hosts, both are bad. It needs to be decentralised. Someone owns and controls the website. And you need Tor installed.
If you thought needing to find your own mixing service was a barrier to entry, Tor websites use stupid unmemorable addresses, you need to setup browsing specifically to use it (and as a result, the NSA tags you and monitors you in a seperate high risk group as with users of VPNs).
Any solution that has a guy running the site ends up with people tracking him down eventually. It only takes one person in the whole world to outsmart you and the game is over.
If the FBI and the NSA know there is someone at the top, they will get there. **It doesn't matter if you dislike parallel construction it will happen and you will go to jail.** Anyone who thinks they are smart enough to overcome those odds needs the lesson in hubris that being caught will bring.
If you host it from home, they correlate spikes in traffic with home users. They will flood TOR again and it will work.
If you host it from a hosting company, eventually they will just offer rewards to hosting companies in the millions and all it will take is one employee to notice that there is TOR traffic leaving the building and to investigate the server, maybe they'll threaten them or maybe they'll just be able to trace it eventually.
There will never be thousands of Silk Road sites on TOR because it is pointless - there aren't even that many successful Facebook clones and it is successful and legal.
Most people will gravitate to one service because it will emerge as being the most trusted, containing the biggest range of product and having the best prices.
While the NSA's front line is known to be ex-stalking sociopaths, you cannot understimate the development and math talent they command.
TOR was initially sponsored by the US Navel Research Laboratory.
That decision would have been cleared by the NSA unless the NSA was comfortable with the threat it posed.
TOR is not a viable option.

No, you don't.
There is a type of transaction where you declare the max you want to pay someon on the blockchain as normal but start by only signing over a small fraction of it. Then you increase that amount by little bits up to the max payment amount privately. So every microtransaction isn't a new transaction. 
This is how microtransactions should be handled.
Your payment to the game and the game's payment back to you should be one of these.
That way you can send thousands of payments and not Satoshi Dice the blockchain.

I believe this is the first time that someone has said an association with Butterfly Labs adds credibility.

I believe ASIC miner said they wanted to account for around 20% of all blocks mined though it could have easily been someone else.
20% seems to be where they believe they can get the most Bitcoin without harming the exchange rate, so if you believe them it makes sense to keep anything that would push you over 20% offline.

Data goes through the internet.
There is a connection to the internet.
Even if the device cannot directly access it, there is a route - yes that route is used to connect to other Tor nodes, but it still does so over the internet.
Tor is not its own network, they don't run their own cables, it runs ON TOP of the internet and as such parts of its activity can be monitored even if not decrypted - decryption isn't necassary when you are both sending and receiving the data in question.
They aren't trying to find out what is in the request because they are the one making the request, they only need to follow the effects of multiple requests until they can find a pattern that leads to the host at the point where their network reaches the internet.
Since that is going to be the location where the servers are, unless they are running cables from another building, finding where this private network first meets the internet is how you find the host.
You keep saying "there is no route to the internet" but the traffic travels across the internet between nodes - at some point data has to go from his network to the internet, at that point it is vulnerable.
That is a route, that is a weakness.

Do I need to submit a comment or is the quote enough?
@_date: 2013-09-10 12:01:24
Donating or "Donating"?
How I would separate it - is this a private tracker that needs you to maintain a share ratio above 1 to keep your account open and do donations increase your share ratio?
If so - that makes them a for profit business and not a charity - I am not commenting on this site specifically because I am not a member, just asking the question because I have no other way to tell.
The problem with private trackers that do all of the above (mandatory ratio, ratio increase for donations) is that some people will inevitably upload more than 1:1 - that means there is someone who will then be under 1:1 and they will be forced to pay to keep their account, there is no way for everyone to get to 1:1 if even 1 person goes beyond 1:1 unless someone donates.
Sure, they could make it back by uploading extra on another torrent, but that drives someone else's ratio under 1:1 - eventually someone has to bite the bullet and "buy ratio".
There were a few large trackers that would take the donation money, which exceeded their costs, and give "donations" to users who would run "Seed Boxes" - because Seed Boxes are incredibly fast, I have seen accounts get a ratio of 1000:1 - leaving hundreds of people with a ratio of under 1:1 and a need to buy more ratio.
The more people that "donate" the better Seed Boxes they can afford, the more people's ratio they can destroy with the Seed Boxes and the more people have to fork out cash.
I realise anything negative tends not to be read, but it is a pretty pervasive scam and people like Seed Boxes because what they see up front is faster downloads - paid ratio sites need to go. It isn't obvious to everyone that it isn't always going to be possible to keep your account and not pay for it.

Just because other people aren't paying tax doesn't mean you shouldn't - Bitcoin can't make them, it isn't responsible for them. Bitcoin didn't make them greedy.
Stability is a product of age and growth.
As for taking a loss - on smaller things I may just accept Bitcoin at the exchange rate but the majority of work I take on is not of that nature. 
If I am quoting on a job that is 3 or 4 months of work I'm not going to prepare a quote in my local currency and stick that into an exchange rate calculator.
I would be looking at the price over a larger time scale and quoting appropriately. If Bitcoin was $100 yesterday and $260 today, you do not get quoted based on the $260 price - don't like it?
Tough. I am not a currency speculator or an exchange. If you want the exchange price go to the exchange and bring the fiat back to me.
It is unlikely they bought in at the peak and besides, I don't see supermarkets rushing out to reprice everything when the exchange rate on fiat changes and they import a lot from multiple countries in multiple currencies. The exchange rate could make or break them if they just blindly followed it like some companies do with their Bitcoin prices - live exchange rate down to the minute!
They price to cover the range of currency fluxuations instead of manically updating their prices every 2 seconds, when the larger players enter the Bitcoin market, they will too.

It is efficient as it needs to be to be secure.
When you look at all the power that goes into encrypting and verifying and storing credit card transactions behind the scenes you begun to realise that it is full of secret data and stored data gathered from many locations, encrypted, assembled and verified for each transaction.
Everyone contributes a little bit of this load and it gets spread thin enough for users not to notice and the bulk of it happens on their severs so you don't think of the cost of running them, but that inefficiency is there too.
Look at their giant data storage and processing facilities, the backups they are legally required to keep, the safe guards they have.
Look at having to encrypt every message because having a credit card number is access to funds. 
Not to mention the programmers and physical security guards, Bitcoin is more efficient - VISAs process isn't open source and you don't belong to a community examining it.
They don't care about efficiency, all credit card companies follow the same laws and procedures so efficiency isn't important as they all have similar costs, they put their costs into transaction fees, companies will pay them because they would lose out not taking credit cards.
VISA doesn't need to compete with Bitcoin on efficiency, I'm only saying if you think Bitcoin is inefficient it is likely you haven't examined any other systems because it does a lot better than them and no one is complaining.

It is assumed the value of Bitcoin will increase a lot but until it does the current smallest unit isn't really worth anything. It would probably cost more in electricity to receive 1 satoshi than the satoshi is worth.

The problem with Bitcoin is that it is so technical in nature that its early adopters are mostly techies.

If the text from the phone wasn't used I would be suspicious of just the password being shitty, however, something caught my eye, the OP said:

Again, finger points at roommate because they had opportunity to steal the password and access the phone.

There's also reclassifying one crime as a lesser crime (that may not get a customodial sentance) because you get a double whammy of catching one criminal while reducing the stats of a more serious crime.
You also don't want prisons to be completely full, because some guy on the news saying "we've so many people in jail we've no more room at all" sounds really terrible.
As does the followup segment "we are letting rapists out early to make room for murderers".
As with most government programs, prison numbers aren't about who should be locked up, they are about which party can take credit this term - it's a game of seeing who can take the most tax money and use it to manipulate the electorate the most.

It wouldn't really be something you did with every spend(it's mostly just a sanatised solution to the OP's problem of "how can I send everything except X amount without screwing the interface), it would be something you did once in a long while to say... send 4BTC from your main address to your savings while sending the rest back to the main address, taking advantage of the 4BTC to gather the dust at the same time. This is worth while because I've had transactions where there was so much dust the fee was almost as high as the actual spend.
My thought on the dust though - if you had to ability to clear out accounts rather than waiting until you have KB's of dust you will be able to prevent this by clearing out the address more often.
Plus, although the dust is a problem, it isn't a problem with my solution it is a problem with the OP's question. If he wants to clear out an address that contains dust, he has to clear out the dust too. It doesn't matter how he tackled it, it would pick up the dust. 
There are also two places to get dust - wasting your time with faucets that give out dust and having change from previous transactions. If you are sending all your change back to yourself with each transaction the dust would never build up from your own transactions, though it would be more sensible to bundle the dust in with a legitimate transaction after a little has build up to stop it getting worse.
By bundling all your transactions into transactions to yourself you end up merging the dust into 1 single transaction again. If you do it before hitting size limits and with an address with a reasonable amount of aged funds, you could once a month cheekily send all your money back to yourself with zero fee to merge the dust.
By making the clients clean up dust, pruning the blockchain becomes easier. Sucks to have to keep a whole section because there is an unspend satoshi.
That said, this probably is an answer to the OP's question rather than something you would do with every transaction.
Avoiding taint is possible because clients already have the blockchain, they could pick up on which addresses have mingled and which haven't. I think it would potentially take a bit of work but not an impossible amount.
Currently I would recommend people use different wallet software or accounts with an online wallet provider, it is worth the hassle but it would be nice to avoid it.
Double spends would still be a danger, if you were connected to a internet to check against them, you would be just as well submitting the transaction and having it included in a block - there is no better proof of you owning funds than your ability to give them to me.
I'm hoping there will be a "protocol light" in the future - so that light clients can request some specific information rather than blocks. Eg: "Is transaction ID X unspent:" and you get a "Yes/No" answer - security is achieved by asking a lot of nodes the same question and there would only be issues where the outcome is questionable, in which case back to sending me money.
You would really need to verify it online, I could sync to a point and spend the money after that point from another wallet, if I'm not fully synced your last few blocks could include transactions that never occured on the main net and if you have "old money" you may be carrying around a lot of blocks.
The Bitcoin doodads work/will work this way - they let you sign transactions and return them to the merchant who broadcasts them to the network for you, meaning the doodads can be made cheaply because they don't need internet access.
1. Your lite device only knows about its own transactions, doesn't contain any blocks.
2. When you try to send money, you enter the amount and the address and sign the transaction and then send the transaction to the merchant who broadcasts it for you.
Realistically, anything but live information can't be accepted as proof and if I trusted you(if say, you were my brother) I'd trust you without proof.

You don't to look further than the people who have already replied to you to understand it wasn't "injected into the source code".
I'm not saying ignore vulnerabilities. I'm saying we should do the opposite - crowd source finding them.
I'm saying if you keep trying to simplify your explanation there is a risk that you will say things that are no longer true.
When you start saying "anyone can just add code", you've done just that. You've taken to explaining the  Open Source of Bitcoin by missing out things and those things are actually important to how things work and as a result what you said just simply isn't true.
Sure some of your satelite statements are "true enough", it isn't invulnerable, people will attempt to exploit it, someone may even try to have mallicious code accepted into the Satoshi Client. Sure, there are a lot of people who have worked on various parts of the code base.
That doesn't quantify or qualify the code review process. It doesn't MEAN anything - lots of people contribute to closed source software which also has bugs.
But when it is all said and done it matters that what you said isn't true.
For someone who is "recognising potential vulnerabilities" you have yet to acknowledge the true source of an actual vulnerability even it has been pointed out to you several times and you don't seem to have offered a single solution.

They don't have to do anything. It sucks but it is reality.
I'm not saying you shouldn't attempt to get your money back, I said the opposite.
At the same time, it didn't happen because you didn't have access to information, it happened because you thought you knew better than every single person who gave you advice - there is no one who says to use PayPal, that means you had to ignore everyone and everything you read.

'Accept' meaning I give them my secure Bitcoin and they give me access to money they can take back whenever they want?

You can't make an address send something because they broke the rules, transactions need to be signed and you can't let miners decide anything and call this trustless - you'd need to trust them.
The system we have prevents double spends better, and actual green addresses are more useful.

1 - this is silly. If they had access to your account they were likely checking it, that it happened to be a day is not by itself noteworthy. It doesn't suggest someone was notified, if they were, they would have been notified earlier.
2 - Probably a script that always leaves enough to cover the transaction or a user who didn't take it all.
3 - Kind of, but given that you can't tell enough about the owners of addresses from the Blockchain, by the time it passes to someone you can get in touch with they probably have no way of tracing the transaction back to the person who stole it and the person you are speaking to isn't responsible for covering your loss.

It is very unforgiving - a compromised private key is forever compromised. It isn't like online banking, you can't change a password.
Average users will want to use online banking, with security measures and no direct access to private keys.
There is a place for banks in Bitcoin, there just isn't enough users right now for banks to think it is profitable.

Bitcoins are only worth anything if you can exchange them for goods and services.
I would stop accepting Bitcoin if enough people decided to go down this road for it to happen.
I'd also start telling friends/family that a lot of other people are going to follow suit and they should cash out.
Remember 'miners' aren't a homogenous group and as soon as you have more than one person giving an opinion you have a disagreement.
This would need the majority of miners to be for the idea and a lot of them won't be - they understand the fixed number and release rate contributes to Bitcoins value.
If you double the amount you half the value.
Sure, some new miners might like the idea of higher rewards but the miners who have been around longer and have significant savings in Bitcoin don't want to see the thousands they have saved devalued to increase the reward.
'You can have a reward of 50 coins instead of 25 coins but the thousand coins you already have saved will be worth half as much' is an awful deal.

Looks like someone playing with scripts -  
Originally, the person who owned them attached a custom script instead of sending them to a specific address, that script is:
    OP_DROP OP_1
Which seems to just mean anyone can spent it, I 'translated' it to mean:
    return true
Bitcoin does not have a sender address exactly - Blockchain.info just lists the address of the last person who received them which for most transactions works but in this case, because the coins were attached to the script instead of being sent to an address, when they are later claimed the last person to own them is not an address so Blockchain.info can't show you the sender.
Edit: From the wiki:


However, the method they mention for this is:
     scriptPubKey: (empty)
     scriptSig: OP_TRUE
Since the OP's example uses a different method, it wouldn't be effected by checking for the above script, so it would get broadcast.

When I say signing algorithm I mean, whatever you use to create a digital signiture.
Bitcoin uses ECDSA for the signiture part, although it uses SHA256 in a number of other places SHA256 is not used for signitures.
You cannot sign something with SHA256, that isn't what it does. Hashing is one way and verifiable only if you have the component (read SECRET) parts where signitures are only useful if you don't have to give away private information at all.

A lot more!
Me point is one is re-painting a white door brown, the other is sandblasting it.
You could end up with brown wood either way, but they aren't the same - that becomes apparent when you try to sandblast your car brown.
You cannot physically create a signiture or a private key with sha256.
There is no way to take something "signed" by a sha256 private key and verify it against a sha256 public key to make sure the owner of the public key really has the private key. With hashing, they know you have it because you give them it - which isn't very secure because they can now take it and log into other websites with it.
I think you are thrown by Bitcoin using Sha256 in the process but it does not use it in the part of the process that handles signing/verifying signitures.
It does make it more secure - to verify a hash, they need your "private" information - in most cases your password - to verify a signiture, they only need your public key/address.
As with signing no private information ever changes hands, it cannot ever be comprimised or stolen, this is not possible with hashing where you have to turn over your keys to prove you can.

Visa runs more servers and stores more data than Bitcoin.
As almost everything is secret (eg credit card numbers are access to funds) everything needs encrypted which adds to the server load. Doesn't sound like a lot. Over hundreds of thousands of machines it is.
They also need to run antifraud measures constantly to make sure you are spending 'like normal' and run countless cash machines. If you thought mining rigs were heavy duty you should see a data centre.
They also manufacture pointless plastic cards that get thrown away eventually and that now need metal chips that need dedicated hardware to read.
They have dedicated computers on every high street so you can access your money, they run all day regardless of how many people use them. A lot of atm's are just windows pc's and a screen now, don't expect anything hyper efficient or specialised hardware.
Vendors need specialised hardware to read cards.
They store many many redundant copies of everything.
They need to post and deliver the hardware and the cards - the plastic and metal in card machines is not green.
Anyone who thinks Bitcoin is more wasteful doesn't understand the technology they use now never mind the technology behind Bitcoin.
Bitcoin uses electricity to prevent fraudulent transactions and create money.
You don't think creating fiat money takes resources? 
Not only is money expensive to create, it is expensive to transport and destroy, the security systems and cameras watching the people handle it must use a comparable amount of electricity without counting the machines that actually do the printing.
Manufacturing those machines isn't easy either and needs to be supervised. Can't outsource your dollar printing machine manufacturing to China, they might make an extra. 
ASICs are getting increasingly energy efficient - hash for hash against a normal pc, watt for watt, it isn't even a contest.
It took Bitcoin 4 years before market forces created the efficiency jump while Visa can still afford to run normal servers.

Reddit Enhancement Suit now refers to you as "[+9]" - I have read and voted(positively) on most of your posts on the issue(and a lot of everyone else's too) to the point where I recognise and know your username. That includes the above post from a year ago - although we differ in places on implementation I do not think we disagree on anything significant.
I'm not surprised, like the OP, SrPeixinho and many others that we saw Bitcoin and realised that we can have secure checks and balances without an authority and realised that we can apply it to other problems.
One place where we can substitute trust for a consensus on the truth is voting and by doing so we can begin to unravel some of the problems created by the political machine - given how blatant some of those problems are I am not surprised so many people are interested in solving it.
I actually like that we haven't came up with the exact same ideas just as I like that my idea will be worked over by smarter people with the benefit of hindsight once I'm done. 
Even though we ended up at different places, we both started from the same point and intend to reach the same point so we are bound to cross paths along the way. Although I haven't taken from your ideas directly (I feel your existence makes copying unnecessary and that if I am to contribute something it should be something else) I definitely gained a lot from the experience and you have to have inspired some of the choices I made. Even the ideas of yours that I read and won't be puting into practice taught me something. 
We have a shared origin story, shared goal and shared inspiration - familiarity is inevitable.
As we would say in Scotland - I may not be you, but I'm not a kick in the arse off it either.
At this point, I'm mostly here to renew my faith in the public (technology can't beat human nature, so you have to believe ultimately people will do the right thing), to let some of my ideas out so they can have some breathing room and to see if I can fine tune implementation details based on the input of people who aren't me.
I had a few things I wanted to get clear(problems not quite solved) before I committed to actually constructing it or ironing out the full technical details and I'm quite happy with that part now after the last week.
Now I mentally have a complete system, I'm taking a break to let it sink in before I continue, it will be christmas soon and there's lots of real world problems for me there and to make sure I haven't left out the human element by talking to people so next year I can start on the practical problems.

Without calculating difficulty changes, price changes, electricity cost, etc, it would take you almost 2 years to see a return on $5m if you ran all of them and got 20% and kept it through magic. Since the difficulty would go up etc, you would never see a return on running all of them, you would see less on running half.


Yes - if you were able to get them a lot cheaper.
ASIC Miner has pledged to keep 20% of the network and they have spare equipment to back up that claim.
You would be reducing everyone's share, in response, they would deploy more hardware until their share had climbed again, reducing your share and everyone else's further.
The increase in difficulty from you and ASIC throwing that many miners at the market would eventually come back to hurt you to.
It would depend on your costs but unless you are able to manufacture at significantly cheaper than other people purchase at, sell some excess stock to guarantee a profit, your best bet for a return is always to run them the second you can get them because the difficulty is only going to go up and other people will be receiving their ASICs, reducing the share 21 THash/s would get you.
Up until the point where your share of the market harms the value of Bitcoin, more is better and what you have will always be worth slightly less tomorrow.

I think we will have an immediate period of competition because when Bitcoin mining got difficult alt coins were a way for people to use their newly outdated mining rig.
Now that exchanges support both, there are people mining LTC just to trade for BTC - to me that says some of the people involved don't have faith. Compared to Satoshi who has never cashed out or spent his coins.
Unless it does something significantly better and fills another need I think eventually we will have a "winner".
Just like Microsoft's HD DVD and Bluray - when technology is new there are options, but in a lot of cases on wins.
If say, the Bitcoin foundation did something to harm Bitcoin's public image or a country wary of the reputation of Bitcoin but liking the idea of a crpytocurrency endorsed Litecoin we would be down to one currency very quickly.
Just now, Bitcoin is the odds on favourite to win but it isn't certain - it just has a headstart being the original.

No, if a transaction doesn't get included in a block you can create a new transaction with a fee and broadcast it - have a look at createrawtransaction in the API if you managed to get some money stuck by setting the fee too low.
For larger transactions the fee is optional.
My point remains -
    (100% - fee) == 100% // Wrong
    (100% - fee) &lt; 100% // Right
End of discussion.
It doesn't matter if you have to pay the fee, it is still taken from the 100% leaving less than 100% and therefor he won't get 100% back.
It isn't your fault the network mandates a fee, it is your fault you are pretending it doesn't detract from the 100%.

See, we aren't so different - I just think that as soon as we are hitting emotive labels we are distancing ourselves from the issues.
I think Liberal as a label is awful, equally as awful as Conservative but that's besides the point - someone who calls themself a Liberal may be being lazy, there are lots of social, economic, political, etc positions you could take and be accurate enough for conversation to use the word Liberal while maintaining lots of Conservative views.
It really makes it useles to say that a Liberal has X view. That you find it odd only says something about your opinion of Liberals.
As Chris Rock said:


A minor rant:
I would say with regards to social care I am fairly liberal, I would say that America has proven for the rest of the world that the free market doesn't work for health care and prisons. We should thank them for the experiment and walk away without repeating it.
With regards to governmental powers on the other hand I'm removing politicians and ending opertunities for lobbying left and right, if I was in charge Fox News would be splicing in footage of slasher flicks to demonise me.
I think the whole current system is divide and conquer - rather than have us rationally debate issues on their own merits, we are being encouraged to split into camps before hearing the issues and mindlessly throw shit around.
Politicians have done a great job of being characters and the media does a great job of making is choose between the two of them rather than choose from the thousands of more viable ideas - we are being left shitty choices because they are managing us to get us emotionally invested in the game of it and we feel smug about coming down on firmly on one side of the argument when we should feel duped.
At the same time as getting the people who want to join in amped up, it is also managed to disenfranchise the **majority** of people - less than 50% of people vote. 
For me, that says the majority of people are done with the labels, done with the games and done with the bullshit.

Stop diluding yourself.
When you looked back to see if you did get a text, was it unread at that point? If not, here is a recap of the **facts** so far.
You told someone about a large sum of money you had.
They had access to that money.
They had knowledge of you being incapacitated by drugs.
There was a verification text sent to your phone.
When you went back to look at your old texts, that text had already been read.
They had access to your phone.
That money went missing.
Did I miss anything?!
What do you think will happen when you confront them?
One of them will lie, you already want to believe that lie and you'll just go on thinking you could have done it.
They don't even need to produce evidence at this point, you already believe you did it despite there being no evidence in that direction and all the evidence to say you are wrong wrong wrong.
The address used was a brand new address, not one you'd picked up from somewhere like an old transaction and saved.
Do you delete your browser history?
If so - it is a plecebo at best and this time it might have screwed you.
Check your iPhone and computer's browser history for that point in time.
If there are NO ENTRIES then we have eliminated you as a suspect because you could not have gotten the address the funds went to and you will have to come to terms with the truth.
That is your one task, don't talk to them - you really aren't up to it at this point in time and you will lose your opportunity, just trust me. Please.
All you need to do is check your browser history and report back.
Actually here's an extra task - since you described the password as "one of the ones you use" - have you saved this password in a browser, etc, for one of the other places that use the same or similar password?

It isn't "funny things for nerds" it is "why you should laught at nerds".
It isn't just that the jokes aren't smart, it is that they are written so that they make the people watching feel they are smart.

I don't want to build the competition too much but I do my best work when the competition is hungry and on my heels.
Here is a hint: different places will announce results and publish them - you'll probably have to hit rss feeds as well as apis.
Assign each publisher a confidence rating, require a higher confidence rating for matches with a lot of wagers.
You should easily be able to find a dozen reliable sources and require maybe half before announcing results.
Flag matches with conflicting results for manual intervention.
You will want to invest a lot of time into security.
Don't aim for something feature perfect, you don't have any competition so work out what you can launch and do it.
The experience will help and users will be vocal about theit needs and you can go from there.
Megaprojects are risky, by the time you finish things may be different, you may have established competition.

If you search for "whats my ip" on Google, Google tells you.
Your IP address will change slightly on the second half, that is normal. Unless you buy a static IP address (one that doesn't change) or pay extra, you are unlikely to get to keep the same exact one, the first half stays the same because its what your ISP is allocated - think of it like decimal places, it isn't but it does for now.
Plus it does tell you a rough location and it does give you the ISP, if that checks out we are cool - all your building.
Nice work.
We've eliminated people without physical access to your phone and computer because your email wasn't accessed by someone else.
The funds were sent to an address you couldn't have accessed at the time you were drugged so that means it wasn't you.
Don't pretend you maybe deleted an hours worth of browsing history - by default it clears everything, if a half zombie you tried to cover your tracks you would have no browser history left at all. You can't even work out your own IP address sober, I can be more blunt if you need me to be.
Don't pretend you happened to be drugged and get robbed by someone at the same time, someone who didn't know you were drugged.
You are reaching too far to avoid what is obviously left in front of you. I realise it is less painful to believe you did something stupid while incapacitated than it is to believe you were robbed by someone an hour ago you trusted with your life.

Generally speaking, extremely simplified - a script is a programming language where when it comes to run the code, the code itself is run through a program that interprates it by the person who is using it as it is being used - with javascript the code on the webpage is actually the code as it was written and the browser runs it. You can click View Source and find the actual code.
With a progamming language like C, the code you write is put through a compiler by the person who writes the program.
The compiler converts the code into something a computer can understand and that is the program that you would give to users.
Opening the compiled program will not reveal the code.
There are some inbetween languages - Python scripts are compiled to bytecode at the moment the script is run, the bytecode may or may not be deleted immediately after, but as a rule of thumb it is somewhere to start.
TL;DR - a script is code running directly on the end users machine, programming languages have their code run through a compiler by the programmer.

What good is a moral revolution lead by someone who accrued mass amounts of wealth and used it to eliminate his enemies? 
If he is guilty it is entirely relevant. It would mean the power corrupted him, it went to his head and he went from nonviolent protest to murder can be necessary if I deem it so.
The fact that there are other evils in this world don't change any of that. We can't fight evil by doing evil - evil is a concept that we can only eliminate in our own actions.
Justifying murder by comparing it to other murders is not such an action.
People need to stop rewriting their moral code to justify DPR's transgressions and instead work on solidifying their resolve and not repeating his mistakes. 
DPR's initial message was good, we shouldn't stray from it because he did.
Just because you can win an argument showing people aren't consistent with their views, back at ground level  DPR strayed too far from his own message to be beyond punishment.
It stopped being a noble cause when he thought he was taking the power of life and death into his own hands - I understand people's attachment to the figurehead and we haven't had a trial yet, but this is what denial looks like.

Avoid trackers with official seedboxes, especially if they ban users with a low ratio and give bonus bandwidth to users who make "donations".
They may seem like a bonus if you are used to having 0 seeds but they are there to out compete normal users who will not be able to upload enough to maintain a good ratio and will need to "donate" money to improve it.
The scam works like this, the private tracker:
* Hires seedboxes which causes normal users' ratios to worsen
* Bans users with poor ratios
* Accepts donations in exchange for altering your share ratio
The seedboxes make sure that there are people who cannot make a 1:1 ratio and will be subject to a ban because seedboxes have server level bandwidth - I've seen them go 1500:1. The vast majority of users will not be able to match a seedbox.
As every byte downloaded is uploaded by someone, as soon as any uploader  goes over 1:1 there will be at least one person who cannot maintain a good ratio.
People with bad ratios are then offered the chance to donate money to the tracker who credit them with bandwidth.
A fraction of that money goes back into renting seedboxes, some cover the site costs (which are lower than you'd expect) and the rest is profit.
The biggest earner for these websites are users who upload a lot more than 1:1 and force a lot of users into share poverty.
TL;DR *Seedboxes are run to make sure there are always some people who will need to pay money to stick around. It generates profit.*

The multisig question can stay unanswered, it doesn't relate.
You are burning processing power, that is why you would have to justify mining if you created your own coin with its own proof of work.
Bitcoin uses this power to verify transactions and create new coins.
Both are pointless for recording sti test results. 
Clinics should just charge money where appropriate. They can charge in Bitcoin without relating it directly to tests, especially since Bitcoin can be followed.
The clinics should be your trusted authorities, unless the app provider runs tests themselves. 
There are no good reasons to include temporary tests permanently *anywhere*.

I hear telling the IRS "Oops" makes them stop asking for money.
That's stupid - it would just mean that as well as the money they currently take, they would also need to take an address for tax reasons, the same way they need to take an address to verify credit cards now.
If a company in the USA was found to be allowing Bitcoin payments without collecting the information required by law, they would still be prosecuted even though Bitcoin itself allows the payments.
Eventually, people would try to convert money into USD and they'd need to explain where it came from, there would be audits and busts.
Unfortunately unless you can live completely in BTC you can't avoid tax and if you could live completely in BTC you'd probably get an audit anyway.
Amazon is still going to require your address, even if they started accepting Bitcoin.

The miner or pool that solves the block is rewarded with the ability to create new Bitcoins - currently 25 - which they normally give to themselves. That is the incentive to mine.
They also get the transaction fees for all the transactions they include the block.
That solved block can quickly be checked by everyone to make sure their answer is correct.
If they tried to give themselves 255 Bitcoins in that Block the rest of the network can quickly and easily call Bullshit. 
The network, users with full client, wallet hosts and other miners, will only accept that block if the answer is valid and the transactions within it are valid, rightfully spent and owned Bitcoin.
Whether the puzzle is arbitrary doesn't matter - though arbitrary means chosen for no reason.
It isn't arbitrary. It is chosen to take a long time to solve but easy for normal computers to verify they really did solve it.
Take a rubix cube - it might take you a long time to find the solution but I can tell whether or not you did quickly by looking at it. Imagine Bitcoin blocks as 100 sided rubix cubes where each transactions are a colour. Mining is finding the list of turns to make each side all one colour. Solving it is difficult, verifying you really did is easy.
When a valid block is found and added to the block chain, those transactions are considered to have happened and miners start making a new block from the waiting transactions and trying to solve it.
The real blockchain in case of two miners finding a block at the same time is decided by distribution.
They find it, give it out to the network, the network communicates with each other.
If 10 people get sent block a and 20 people get sent block b, we use block b.
However, if the people who solved block a also solved another block then that chain would be valid with less votes because it is longer.
Reversing a transaction in Bitcoin requires the person who wants to reverse it to create a chain longer than the real chain by making blocks that don't include the transaction they want to reverse. If it is their transaction, they make blocks where the Bitcoin goes to another address, then the old transaction becomes invalid because those coins can't be spent both times and the attackers transaction counts because it would have happened first in the fake chain.
Then they send their new chain of blocks which has to be longer than the real chain and everyone would start using it. The chain that did include the transaction is declared never to have happened.
Because other miners are constantly adding to the real chain and collectively have more power, attackers can't go back to before a transaction they don't like was made and start mining because the real chain keeps getting bigger and the difficulty goes up.
As long as 51% of mining power isn't trying to work on blocks without that transaction a hacker can never make a longer chain, that is how mining secures transactions by stopping them being reversed.
Normal clients verify the contents of blocks before using them to calculate balances, including the difficulty, making sure the right amount of Bitcoin was made and making sure only unspent money is being spent by people who have a right to spend it.
One cpu per vote refers to the clients voting on which chain of blocks is the longest and the real one and not mining.

Mining doesn't prove you are one person.
There **are** better options, such as having an account on the Bitcoin Talk forum - that proves participation and their barrier to having an account is 4 hours of browsing and 5 posts.
It is not particularly high, but high enough that it would be difficult for one person to control thousands of votes. Sure, a person may even get a dozen votes, but if you allow people to vote with their money, a bot could vote thousands of times easily.
Bitcoin is easily divisible, creating extra votes for those willing to pay the transaction fees.
It is not full proof, but at least we aren't creating Winklevoscoin.

I consider Bitcoin to be an example of it done right - there is no morality implied or encouraged by the protocol.
Even using Bitcoin to pay for the most heinous act is permitted by the network and treated no differently than a donation to charity.
I disagree with the accusation that this is pleasing everyone, I consider it the opposite - pleasing no one.
The network should remain neutral and uncaring by enabling morality to happen outside of the software, in the wetware of the people who use it.
It shouldn't favour anyone, least of all me, if I was fit for that task we'd not need to vote, I could be a dictator.

There are already alternatives from other developers, if it turns out there is a right system we should use nothing I do will compromise the adoption of it.
Alt coins aren't the same - it would be like having a Silk Road only alt coin, by being so specific its utility is harmed, each type of business or county doesn't have an altcoin - the differences between altcoins isn't how you spend them or what you can buy with them.

I still think eventually we will have an infostructure.
Banks will offer accounts and payments in Bitcoin and with that you will be covered by their insurance, merchants will benefit from having payments guaranteed by a bank and not having to wait for a bunch of confirmations which doesn't really work in Starbucks.
Merchant services offered in this way will offer fruad protection to increase buyer confidence and those merchant services will have the power to withhold funds from companies in order to refund you.

I think they stress test batches of a given until failure (which probably runs the card as hard as Bitcoin Mining except evenly over all components) so that they know the rough lifespan. "If it can take 100 hours of this it'd probably live 10 years in a normal PC".
Individual cards they would just test to make sure they work but realistically but not to the same degree, I've had DOA components a few times and it is cheaper to replace them than to run every card.
One one hand, Bitcoin mining might offset some of the cost but on the other hand it wouldn't test all of the components of the card equally so it wouldn't be a good enough test.

Do you make thoughts like you make your breakfast or does your brain have thoughts like your heart beats?
I think thoughts will arrive involuntarily.
Not all thoughts, just that there are thoughts that will happen even if you put no effort into making them happen.


Thoughts happen of their own accord, responsibility applies to your actions and efforts.
If your mind has the thought "smash that man in the face with a brick" that is okay, doing it is a different matter.
A choice is not like your heart beat and neither is an action, although your subconscious can influence your choices, choices are the result of conscious effort. You have to do something to make a choice that you don't have to do to experience thoughts and pain.
There are most certainly egos, there is also more than ego.


One of us isn't following the other. Dancing and music is very real.


Who else would define your own happiness?


Anyone can checkout at anytime yet we are both still here.
You say that life was forced on you, I say I was given it before I knew how to ask for it.
Am I dilluded? I don't think so.
I don't deny happiness happens, I don't deny pain is unavoidable if you want to live.
What I do say is that there is the pain caused by events and the pain caused by how you relate to events.
My opinion on the pain caused by how you relate to your events should be clear - you are responsible for your own actions and efforts - if your efforts are causing you pain you should take responsibility for those efforts and direct your energy towards wiser actions.
My opinion on the pain caused by events is that it is done. Pain is a ripple - no amount of slapping the water will stop it spreading, but you have to realise if left alone the pond will settle.
There is nothing to be done with pain except experience it - I say this as someone who has experienced pain.
Most people would call me a pessimist even.
I think this discussion is best summed up in a demonstration:
**Sit still.**
Don't think of anything, don't make any effort to think of nothing, just sit still and count to 30.
While you were doing that, did you think of something anyway?
Do you still believe that you think your thoughts? Do you think the thoughts you want to when you want to? Do you think you control your thoughts?
How high can you count without thinking of something while you are trying not to?
"Made it to 10" is still a thought, though I've never made it that high.

It is possible we found us a thief, though there is no exact correlation between an IP Address and location, it is very possible that the location marker on the map is just wrong and it really was you. As IP Addresses don't have a real "place", Google estimates them - sometimes (most of the time) it gets scary close - mine litterally points to where I'm sitting through the roof, but you can never tell whether a marker is in the right place without extra information.
I imagine the IP address handed out to iPhones changes fairly frequently and they don't have fixed locations on a map (and the marker doesn't follow them when they move, they are just the rough location of where they are allocated) so I would be 50/50 on believing it was you - however, if the marker for your iPhone is accurate that improves the odds a little.
The good news is if you have an IP Address and a time, you can file a police report and contact Verizon who won't be able to tell you specific information about the IP if it is someone else's - which is good enough, you can move on to getting a warrant, but if it was you they can clear it up fairly quickly.
If it wasn't, they will be able to reveal more once supplied with a warrant - you likely exceed the amount for your state - 
With the amount being what it is, Google will also be able to reveal further information if you were to get a warrant tough IPhones tend to be particularly traceable because they are mostly under contract.
A few other members here seem to be a little suspicious of going to the police, but as you have done nothing illegal you should definitely persue it if you can.
Contact Verizon first to make sure it wasn't you, I warn you that first line support will fob you off and might refuse to help and will insist that they can't do the thing you are asking, you need to be specific enough with how you say things to have them hand you to a supervisor but not threatening. I worked for an ISP answering the phones (don't hate me) "I'm calling the police" translates to "Thank you good sir, this is now out of your hands, say reasuring things so I will go away but take no further action".
Prefered phrasing is along the lines of (and be nice to them, it is a sucky job - I have bent over backwards for people just because they recognised I was a human being after a string of people who did not!) "On {Date} was {IP Address} assigned to my phone or modem?  I need this information to file a police report, I am willing to hold to speak to a supervisor. Could I also have your name and an extension number / identification number for you as well for the report and so that I am able to request to talk to you again? I understand if you personally cannot access this information for me but as it is urgent I will wait on the line until I escalate the issue.
Request the name / extension of everyone they forward you on to.
The reason you ask for their name / extension number isn't because you really need it, it is because most call centre employees consider themselves anonymous and nothing really ever comes back to them when it goes wrong and from working on the inside this brings out the laziest attitude where the goal is just to get customers to go away so they aren't your problem anymore - take their name, write it down, refer to them by name a few times (but not excessively) so that they know you are making them personally responsible. This is a fairly good call centre tip in general.
Good luck.

They don't need to know what is in the data because they are the one sending it - though your own encrpytion is always weaker anyway. If they did go the route of buying hosting, I assume they would have their own server's private key.
They would try it at different times of the day when different peers are connected and see if there is a pattern between one machine sending data and them requesting data.
They could do that with just the NSA's resources, but if they add a few of their own servers into the swarm they cut down the number of candidates.
Given how many services this particular host offers they can combine this data with the total traffic processed by each node and look at the busiest because a normal node would not relay as much data as an extremely popular host.
By default Tor only uses 3 hops, so each node can't see nearly as much traffic as this host would.

TOR requires a central authority to accept requests on behalf of the website.
It needs at least one node to be able to prove they speak for the site. It does so by having a secret key that is kept secret.
Whoever knows the key can pose as the market. It needs someone in charge to keep the key secret and maintain it, shut it down or run it as a honey pot. This is not suitable for a decentralised market place.
If you aren't going the TOR secret key route, you don't need to use TOR at all.


Now you see my whole ambition and the size of my mountain.
I don't want to control and oversee a market like DPR - I want to create a market that will be so free that it will be beyond my own reach.
I gave it some thought and I don't think one person can ever have that much power or responsibility without being put under too much pressure or being in a position where abusing that power will not be more attractive than the alternative.

Theory versus practice - knowing how it works is enough to build a holistic world view.
Wanting to study programming and leaving it there is like saying you want to study the practical aspects of woodwork but have no plans to build something in wood.
I find the best way to learn to program is to want to make things with it, not to learn it because you believe there is value in the learning - you really need to apply it understand it, otherwise you will hit all the points the books bring up and get nothing of value from it.
So, what would you like to make?

The ISP still assigns you an IP address.
The NSA can still monitor points on the internet for traffic destined to and from that IP address.
The NSA can still find who owns that IP address, your ISP.
When asked by the NSA, the ISP will report that it is yours.
Traffic can't get to you if it doesn't know where to go - something has to route it to you. The organisation that does so is not loyal to you.
Good luck with the plecebo.

I don't care about the size of multisig transactions, my problem is that the only reason to use Bitcoin is that Bitcoin provides data storage.

They create a private key per person (or at least one).
With the API you can give each key a label and save that label in a database linked to the person who owns the account.
When you need to send funds or check the balance you can use that label with the API.
There are tools to get you started but the exchanges did all the hard work themselves.
That said the mature sections of the Bitcoin API are relatively straight forward and if you use the Testnet you will be able to test using the real Bitcoin client without using real money.
Edit: The API is here:

It should be possible to create a program that creates near misses from your actual password and tries them against your wallet.

It is a good way to give money to someone where trust is implied: Eg: giving someone money in a birthday card, leaving money to relatives when you die.
It is an awful way to conduct a trade or buy something.

I have people enter a refund address before giving them an address to pay me.
You can lock it in so even if their account is hacked withdrawals can only be made to that address.
There are too many ways people can pay you from an address you can't refund - eg send only addresses or green addresses they don't actually own.
If a single transaction is made of lots of little transactions you only have one big transaction to deal with.
If they pay you in seperate little transactions you could refund them separately to make fee calculation easier but it isn't that difficult.
To be honest, I wouldn't use a company that thought calculating the fee was particularly hard when the rules are clearly defined. I can't imagine bug free code written by someone struggling to make a computer count.
I also wouldn't use a company that made up for their inability to program by keeping money sent to them by accident.
If less money than you require is received there should be a note sent to the use telling them what is left to pay and informing them that after x hours if that amount is not received all the money minus the fee will be returned.
If more is received, the extra minus the fee is returned.

For a web of trust to work, you have to be able to anchor yourself to it. You have to volunteer your information to people you want to have it.
That isn't to say you couldn't trade below the radar after doing so and it wouldn't stop you trading through a wallet people couldn't explicitly identify as yours and it wouldn't stop you getting a new wallet and spending coins from there. Human error happens - you send money from your account to Acme Wedding Rings and people will know.
However, not all feedback would be negative.
If you are doing well, keeping customers satisfied, it may make good sense to keep the same wallet for customers paying in so that new customers see how many happy people traded with you previously.
Although the OP wanted to mark coins, I said it would be more useful to mark transactions. It doesn't matter how much you mix the coins if I'm just following a particular wallet I know is yours because we are friends and you told me so we could share feedback about people we've traded with.
You don't always need to know where the coins were ultimately spent, just that address x belongs to organisation y and 4 of your friends labelled them "bastard".
Bitcoin is not anonymous. It is possible create a Bitcoin wallet with no association with you and to trade with it, but it is far more convenient to transfer money through a legitimate service that complies with money laundering laws and can be linked to you.
The majority of people aren't doing anything wrong or illegal so they will favour convenient methods of converting between their bank and bitcoin.
With advances in statistical analysis and full access to the transaction history will come interesting titbits about bitcoin users.
It will be possible to assign probabilities to wallets for example, to determine whether they belong to a person, a script or a collection of people.
If online shops use fixed addresses (take Satoshi Dice), it will be possible to look up that information and build lists of people who paid them money.
It doesn't matter that it is possible to escape that kind of analysis, it doesn't need to work on everyone to be useful.
The problem with automated mixing is that it follows a formula - if someone can prove a set of given trades are following a formula, they can determine the real source and destination.

If you are writing a program to crack or bypass the security measures so that you can gain access to funds you have no legal claim to you are unlikely to be considered a legitimate owner.
Essentially, since having two people with the same key is so unlikely that you can assume the second person didn't generate it randomly but got it from the first person.
The legitimate owner would be the person who can prove they used the address first, probably by having a 3rd party such as MtGox say that it was used as a payout address on X date by a user who supplied Y details.

While we can agree on what the BlockID is, we can't tell when it will be - they are only generated roughly every 10 minutes.
Timestamps on the other hand can include the timezone.
There are two options:
Option 1 the Bitcoin protocol allows time based variables be used to select different output addresses.
Neat feature but useless for replacing a transaction you sent without a fee because it would need to be included in block to matter, which means it was accepted with no fee anyway and you don't have a problem.
Option 2 Bitcoin clients provide a list of unconfirmed transactions they are trying to send and let you cancel them by creating a new transaction using the inputs of the transaction you want to cancel.
The Bitcoins could then be spent with a fee, providing the zero fee transaction isn't included in a block first.
This also requires zero changes to the Bitcoin protocol.
This isn't a double spend because the original amount was never processed.
As long as the client uses one input from the pending transaction the pending transaction would not be processed.
Eg: If you sent 1BTC collected from 10 transactions of 0.1 each, you could invalidate that transaction by sending just one 0.1 BTC elsewhere.
The second option is better for cases where you just forgot the fee.
A more interesting use of being able to add time based variables would be using it to set the fee so your transaction gets processed earlier.
Eg: If this transaction is included in the next block, the fee is 0.05, the block after that 0.2 and after that 0.1.
This is because although the idea is that higher fees gets you processed quicker you can't guarantee it.

You can't compare a device like a phone where people are used to not owning it (sorry, if you have an iPhone and you bought it outright, you still rent it from Apple who can remotely delete apps and need to approve the content you use) and a computer.
People will put up with shit on their phone because it hasn't quite sunk in that they are fully functioning computers and to be honest fuck it angry birds works.
If you buy a computer and it tells you "You don't own this device, you are not authorised to install that" it won't sell.

You can't protect people from themselves and you can't introduce a product where the selling point is "we think you are too stupid to have full control of this device you bought, therefor we've locked you out of some parts completely".
It doesn't matter  how stupid people are, they don't want you to call them stupid.

You can create a payment for say 10 Bitcoin and only sign 1 Bitcoin of your own money towards it.

Bitcoin is a secure payment network without a central authority, it is not a wealth redistribution program.
It isn't meant to solve that problem and I don't know where you got the impression it should.
What it does do is prevent VISA saying you can't donate to Wikileaks (happened) or PayPal refusing to let you open an account because they don't like what you sell(also happened) or refunding a legitimate sale and having the goods destroyed(happened to someone who sold an antique violin, PayPal instructed the buyer to destroy it instead of returning it and refunded the payment leaving the seller with no money and no violin!).
It prevents people forging their own Bitcoins from nothing.
It prevents an authority from confiscating your money (see Cyprus).

Wallets get compromised in a variety of ways but none of that is relevant here. A hacked bank account would likely end in the insurance company paying the bank and you getting your money back. With Bitcoin it is gone. Forever.
My point is - if everyone buys Bitcoin in anticipation of what it will be worth instead of using it like a currency and buying things with it, it won't be worth anything.
If we push Bitcoin's possible future value we'll end up with a lot of coins in the possession of people who just want to cash out later. We need to push uses.

More like Bazinga - he missed the mark.
Can you see where I suggested any solutions?
Hint - I didn't endorse or suggest anything. I answered his question which was "how does the current government handle it", I didn't say it was the right way - when asked directly if I agree with it, I've actually said no. Several times. Directly to him, he just ignores it.
He made personal attacks about views he only imagines I have, then made jokes about a rediculous thing I never said.
This is a perfect example of how discussion gets stiffled on and why it is edging everyone else out.
"Oh, that person said something reasonable but out of line with my political beliefs, I will now act like they said something extreme, argue against what I imagine they believe and hope people upvote me anyway because we're on the same side".
My post was a quote. I copied and pasted it from the law because he asked how it was currently handled.
It wasn't my opinion, I never said the government was doing well, I answered a factual question with facts!
I asked the same question of him that he asked of everyone else. I didn't give any opinion and neither did he - he didn't even bother to answer, he just kept rambling and he got upvotes from people on his side because they were on his side.
He's escalated to pretending I want the government to enforce things with guns and saying I want to put people with weapons outside of old folks homes and people are like "on my side, better upvote!".
**Law enforcement doesn't even get guns in my country.**
He went crazy and he got support from his side anyway.

I wasn't expecting this reply, I was hoping to get a thumbs up since the HMRC declared Bitcoin not money and be able to operate openly and give people a reputable site to use.
I was shocked at the reply because it seems contrary to the HMRC decision. When it sunk in, I was shocked again - if they'll tell me Bitcoin sites need to be licensed they'd tell anyone.
If I'm the first person posting this that means none of the UK sites did basic homework before opening - they just took a stranger's word on a forum it was legal.
A whole community sprung up without anyone getting sound legal advice, that's crazy when you think about it - we are a few years in and people have been setting up businesses without reading page 1 of the laws that affect them.
Its a scary oversight on quite a scale. I checked the UK because I live here, it makes me wonder if sites in other countries haven't neglected their homework also.
It is odd it got so far before anyone checked the law, especially given how easy it was.
I only checked because I'm a developer who thought it might be a fun side project, I had no serious plans to make one but even with everyone saying I wouldn't need a license I still wanted to personally check. 
I can't imagine building a site like this before checking the law - it is a lot of effort, I'd want assurances.

Again - I'm not taking issues with donations, even for sites that are pofitable, just sites with enforced minimum ratios that reward donors with "upload bandwidth".
On one hand they turn the site into Newsgroups because a selection of people will choose to pay instead of seeding at all and everyone's downloads are now slower. 
On the other hand, there are some people who will always be forced to either pay a "donation" or lose their account because of users who go over 1:1. 
It essentially makes it a business of selling users' bandwidth to each other and arbitrarily extorting users with slower internet.

RTS and RPG games have taught me that while you make that decision a coallition of bastards will kill you and harvest your organs.
Bitcoin currently could not.
However, as it becomes difficult to anonymously buy in, it becomes difficult to anonymously spend - they only need to pass laws mandating that companies use addresses that can be traced back to them (look at the request payment option using x.509 certificates to request payments while proving the owner of the address).
As you know their addresses, you can work backwards to make sure there is nothing wrong with the money they are receiving.
Governments only need to pass these laws and enforce them on larger merchants which will act as choke points - if your tainted untaxed money can't be used to pay bills and buy food less people will be inclined to try, given that accidently mixing it with your legitimate money leaves a permanent streak of shit back to you I think most people aren't going to risk it and those that do can be automatically fined without any human intervention.
The Government can automatically verify transactions on the Blockchain and make sure that companies are complying - it would be a lot easier to audit Bitcoin transactions to known addresses than to audit the current system.
People will argue that this isn't part of Bitcoin, but the law preventing people crossing the border with $100,000 in bank notes isn't part of the bank note.

It doesn't matter if the seller doesn't care, everyone has to be happy and secure to protect both parties from fruad.
If they sign a document stating the expect x amount from address y to address z, it is very easy to verify. If they do not confirm the sending address in advance and they use the wallet for more than one transaction, you'll need to do extra work.
If they don't sign off on the from address then if there is a dispute an additional step has to be taken to prove that the person sending the coins owned the address that sent them. It is still possible, but it is also an additional step.

By borrowing less directly from Bitcoin and not make votes mined - make voting mined.
Its a little odd if each block generates different numbers of votes because people have registered since the last block, it makes checking the right number of votes were created awkward because it changes so often.
The network doesn't need to deal with votes the exact same way as Bitcoin deals with money.
Let Bitcoin be the inspiration for a p2p vote network with incentives for nodes by all means but unlike with altcoins it is not appropriate to use the Bitcoin code near wholesale because of the difference between voting and transacting.

Paypal's terms and conditions are clear and since they had to refund the OP out of their own money so they could refund the buyer they are not going to keep this up.
This is not a trend, this is one guy not realising how lucky he is and trying to get everyone else to put their nuts in the fire.
Think about this scam - I sell Bitcoin to you on ebay, you contest it and get a refund and then I complain until PayPal cover's that refund with their own money, if 100 people did that with $100 with of Bitcoin PayPal is out $10,000 - they aren't going to stop reversing transactions, the OP believes they will give out their own money to cover it.
I can see them doing it once or twice for relatively low amounts but they clearly aren't going to make a habbit of it.

Sorry - the execution is unworkable. It is completely open to abuse and it isn't better than what we have.
If a malicious miner wanted to harm me they could lie about a doublespend. Sure, you made the fee high so they'll do it in a block they solved and get it straight back.
They can take the BTC sent to the sink address and never even look for double spends. Free money.
Why'd I 'invest' (throwaway) my money so that MacDonalds doesn't have install a real client that can see doublespends? 
Just now the information you get is exactly the same as miners get.
If miners have to send a satoshi we would have to wait until that transaction gets included in a block. How does getting that information 1 block later than I'm getting it now as a minimum make doublespends less profitable? 
MacDonalds could have accepted a 1 confirmation transaction but instead they'd have to wait a transaction to see if any miners are reporting a double spend.
In top of all that... Existing green address implementations don't require me to throw away the amount I want to spend to prove I can. 
I'd also be locked into that address, the standard advice is to use different addresses for each transaction. 
If the private key was ever stolen I can't get the 'investment' back.
Addresses are disposable, not investments.

In the same way a DNA test suggests it is yours. It is just mathematically unlikely otherwise.
The odds of someone else generating a matching private key are worse than ending up with someone with matching DNA.
If a DNA test is a strong enough suggestion to be considered proof I think you'll have trouble arguing there is a reasonable doubt someone else happened to generate the same key.
If the numbers genuinely interest you, hit Google. I read a few predictions on the profitability of 'mining' private keys with the goal being to generate one that is the same as someone else's. I'd give you a link but I'm using my phone.
I was replying to the comment chain in general, which started by suggesting saying the key was destroyed.
Lost is better than destroyed because someone finding your key is more probable.

Someone once told me - when you completely understand the rules you can break them whenever you want.
With regards to programming - at least to me - that means you follow even the rules that seem stupid and that feel wrong in the beginning.
You'll find by the time you have enough experience to break the rules you won't want to break them anymore.
While I can't tell what your specific idea entails, since you haven't presented it yet, I do know the rules, I can tell you that the Bitcoin qt source code shouldn't be anyone's first job and I will repeat that if you are willing to develop your understanding to be able to look at the code you will never actually need to.
I'm not telling you not to dream, I'm telling you if you genuinely want to achieve you should stop barking up this particular tree.
Don't compare yourself to Einsteine, you aren't developing new science you are learning an existing, established one. You have no support for a different reason - experience has taught everyone else not to do things the way you want to. If you want to disregard that advice then you can't expect anyone to be able to help you.
If you want to start following it, you will find yourself in better company in a place where people can point you in the right direction.
It may be more boring and rigid than you'd like but while writing code has an art to it, the learning process is a fairly well developed science.
While a little tongue in cheek the answer Hello World is exactly what you needed.
As Bitcoin can be implemented in most languages you don't particularly need to know any if you understand it in English. Reading the code just gives you another language to learn, so you can read the native code and turn it into English internally.
You do not gain any extra detail or understanding from the code than from the English description, at best you'll learn to write your own English description. It won't likely be better than the wiki.
That makes learning C++ so you can 'have an idea' pointless, even if you disagree you don't do so because of knowledge or experience. If you want to learn it anyway, have at it but don't do so believing there is extra value in it.
You may still decide to learn programming later but the truth is you could do all that and discover you've nothing to add to an altcoin.
Better not to learn a whole new language to discover that plus if you discover what you want to do first, you can ask useful questions, get help and only learn the bits you need to.
This isn't even your first day learning - you are still at the choosing classes stage. You may not be used to being the new guy but that's your position now.
If I transfered to your job I'd expect to take notes, you seem to expect to be the lecturer.

Yes, compared to the UK, from right to left:
Labour(UK) -&gt; Conservative(UK) -&gt; Democrats(US) -&gt; Republicans(US)
Even America's "lefties" are still to the right of the UK's most popular right party.
However, people on the "popular left" as in, "what left means to most people who consider themselves left" aren't communists by any stretch. Someone has been in America too long - it is like looking at the stars for too long, you lose perspective.
The UK's left, a distant leap from America's left but still a million miles away from communism would have bailed out the banks and went to war in Iraq.
The vast majority of people on the left are not communists.

There is the existing rule of law - tracking down the people that run Avalon and taking legal action is an option.
Cash is non-reversable in the same way, if you pay for something in cash and something goes wrong you don't just give up on the money.
If you meet someone in a back alley and give them cash you shouldn't be surprised if they disapear with it, similarly, you shouldn't just be sending Bitcoin without verifying their identity.
Note: A Planned update that will use x.509 certificates to request funds will mean that the buyer will be able to prove that a given address belongs to a given company, with the blockchain they can prove money was sent to it and by signing a message with the key that sent it they can prove it was them.
This will make getting a legal resolution for Bitcoin disputes a lot easier in the future.
Bitcoin merchant services are possible, they could hold funds for a given number of days so that charge backs come from the held funds. There are credit card processing companies that do that with card payments now, they don't just reach into the bank account of whoever you sent money to and take it out, they take it from a pool of funds they keep back specifically for this.
It is an infrastructure problem, not a Bitcoin problem - Bitcoin doesn't prevent the infrastructure existing, but because Bitcoin is new and outside of existing paradigms it will take a while for one to grow.
Sending Bitcoin one address to another without any further steps or verification is like posting cash - yes, you can only get your cash back if the person you sent it to is willing to give it back.
For larger purchases you can still pay in Bitcoin and have contracts and paper trails just in case.

Except if you successfully mine a block you get the transaction fees so you could vote stuff your own blocks essentially free.

If you live in the UK you may still need a UK developer's license from the Gambling Commission, even hosting offshore.
I'm not an expert on gambling law, but yes, if the Isle of Man has different laws there is a possibility of operating from there.
The reason I am posting is because if you look at the public list of licensed sites there are no Bitcoin sites there because there hasn't been anything posted about whether UK sites definitely need to be licensed.
Now that we are aware that they do, users can start checking if sites they use in the UK are licensed and if they aren't can make a judgement call based on the fact they could get shutdown and take player funds with them.
There are other places to host sites, this is a notice for anyone thinking of hosting in the UK without a license and since all previous discussions here and on BitcoinTalk indicated no license was needed because Bitcoin isn't money.
As with early exchanges that were shut down, there are too many sites opening because the technology is easy to develop for and then ignoring  bureaucracy and paperwork.
As the type of site that is on trend just now are ones where users can either gamble or invest in the site it is important people know they could lose their money if they give it to sites operating outside the law.

I didn't ask because I want your CV, I asked because I wanted an understanding of what you are doing.
If you are trying to read/write transactions, you need to be dealing in binary eventually, if you are getting another program or service to do it for you then that is a completely different scenario.

Don't jump protocols, stick with one and look how it evolved and you will get a fairer comparison. 
I'll stick with websites.
Originally, there was no layout. Everything was plain text only.
Then we got images and layout.
We also got Post Data - forms, so we could send data to websites and have them change.
Then video and encryption.
Layout options improved, we went from having each browser using different code (remember marquees? AOL's browser?) to moving towards a unifying of html and the addition of css.
Interactive flash games.
We added asynchronous javascript so that data can be updated without reloading pages.
Media queries gave birth to responsive design. 
We're approaching ccs3 now.
Okay, so I wrote that from memory and if you were to hit wikipedia some things on the list may need shuffled slightly but the overall point is solid:
There have been a lot of significant improvements and yes it took a while but we are here now - we don't have to replicate any of that - Bitcoin has an entire infrastructure of technology and programmers and accessible hardware that the early internet didn't.
Yes, things are early days but you are here voluntarily and we certainly aren't as far back as gopher.
From a developer's perspective - I find Bitcoin fairly easy and enjoyable to work with. The most difficult barrier to making a wallet from scratch is that blocks and transactions are straight binary - no XML or AJAX to lean back on.
However, even still, the wiki is fairly well documented and I was able to throw a rudimentary blockchain parser together in a day so I didn't have to resort to the API - I didn't even have a particular use case for it, I just wanted to see what it takes.
I remind people it is still early so they realise what is to come, I compare it to the development of the internet because they are familiar with it, but don't expect it to take the two decades and change the web has had to get to here.
We already learnt those lessons first time around.

It isn't because of the bundling, it is that there is no 'sender address' in Bitcoin.
There is also no way to verify if a user still has access to an address, if they don't and you send coins there then they are just gone forever.
If they use a green address then you'll not be sending money back to them at all.

People you trust.
It don't see it working exactly like adblock in that a dozen people compile a list and hundreds of thousands of people accept those lists as gospel.
It would be people you trust commenting on transactions they had personally made and when you traded with someone that your friend had also traded with, you would see any message they put against the transaction.
This is the same as ANY consumer review system that allows random people to leave feedback, except that because bitcoin transaction histories are public you can verify that the person you are talking to is in control of the account that relates to the transaction.
"I bought a TV and it broke after 3 months" vs "I bought a TV, it broke after 3 months and here is the transaction ID".
Maybe if you feel particularly brave, you trust friends of friends: 
You could technically make the whole thing public and allow people to verify owner of a wallet and then comment on the transactions they made and their experiences with the parties they dealt with, but as bitcoin gains traction, I see more people wanting privacy and although people think bitcoin gives it now it doesn't really.
Let's say its the year 2015 and you can use bitcoin everywhere, you are going to propose and buy your engagement ring using bitcoin. If people know that the wallet you use to buy the ring is yours and they can find out what type of entity you just sent money to, they'll be able to spoil the surprise.

No, you are never actually sent Bitcoin, they are added to the Blockchain with a note that says you can spend them.
The client just looks through the Blockchain and finds any mentions of you that you have yet to spend and displays that as a balance.
Therefor it won't know about newer transactions until you have finished syncing but it doesn't make a difference with regards to ownership.

I think that although the alt coins will provide us important information for the next generation of cryptocurrency, greed motivated their creation. Too many people creating coins using Bitcoin's code and relatively small modifications so they could mine them and be set for life.
There isn't a huge amount of technical justification for them. Yes, scrypt is harder to mine.

You cannot randomly type a Bitcoin address because they are in a specific format, random addresses do not work and someone claimed the money shortly after it was transfered there and the chances of a random address being someone's address is so far to nothing it is more likely your roommate also stole a kidney and you haven't noticed.
You are still trying to feel your way out of believing it is possible that it was them. Unless you are lying to me or missing something out, not only is it possible this is by far the most likely thing to have happened.
Look - we both have the exact same facts, the only thing different between me and you is I don't have an emotional attachment to your roommate.
That is the only reason we believe something different happened.
Unless you had that address saved in your address book I'm sure that did not happen.
So your roommates knew you would be asleep and high on painkillers. Gotcha.
Facts. Facts. FACTS.
Are you the only person in the world this person knows? I have friends who know enough about Bitcoin to call me if someone mentions Bitcoin.
Maybe they were drinking and talking to one of their other friends "Oh yeah, my roommate was all "I have $4k Bitcoin" and I was like shit dude, that's not real money" and their friend goes "Fuck, no that's legit, get me to his phone I'll give you $2k cash".
Stop trying to guess and feel your way around this. You've already been robbed, it actually happened.
You told someone, someone accessed your phone, your money was stolen.
You cannot believe they just kept it a secret. There are two types of information - things only you know, things everyone knows. There is no "things only me and the person I talked to knows but I believe they wouldn't share it" category.
You are calling them the only likely suspect, you just haven't woken up to that yet.
I notice you missed out the questions I told you not to lie about but didn't explicitely say you hadn't pirated software.
Who cares that you use it for torrents, that doesn't help me at all - if we are going to blame specific software you need to be more honest. It matters if you only downloaded movies that you double checked were .mp4 and not flash files.
You think I've randomly decided to report you for pirating software? Drop me a PM if you have to. I'm trying to help.

If everyone gets control of themselves then I vote you can't fine me, lock me up or execute me.
Generally speaking, we use voting for disagreements that can't be solved by everyone doing their own thing.

Yup, as the Licensing Officer said -


However, it is possible to see who has a license and who does not here: 
None of the Bitcoin sites I have seen are on that list.
Browing and BitcoinTalk it seems that the most prevailant attitude is that they haven't made a statement about Bitcoin and therefor none of the sites operating from the UK need a license or that the penalty for running a site without a license will be gentle.
I don't see why.
If you are running a dice site from the UK for example - your US competition can get rid of you fairly easily by sending an email and letting the government remove you.
The risk is fairly real since UK Bitcoin sites compete globally and while it may be underhanded, you can't deny the value of having your competitors taken out by their government.
While it may seem obvious to you, especially in hindsight of the statement the Gambling Commission made - site operators have not been thinking this way.
To quote someone on Bitcoin talk:


It seems obvious in hindsight, but no UK sites have gone through the proper channels and several people have cited how difficult the process is and how they were unable to find a clear answer as to whether or not the needed a license so just decided "no".

MtGox is almost certainly a money transmitter (which is why they had problems with their offshoot recently) and they will need to comply with all relevant laws.
However, they are not inside the US, which is why their offshoot had the bank account closed because of incorrect paperwork and MtGox stayed open.
I would say every other money transmitter is a precedent and if MtGox is to survive long term they will see the paperwork they have to fill out increase 10 fold.
In the meantime, that doesn't stop people using exchanges and it doesn't make you personally a money transmitter so as long as you aren't using your MtGox account as a bank I wouldn't worry.

The OP played the 3% game over 100 times.
"If you send money here, we absolutely promise you will lose 97% of the time and the 3% of the times you win will not amount to your total spend, you will end up with 98.1% of what you started with at best".
Satoshi Dice makes everything painfully clear up front - I don't know many other services (yeah, there are clones *now*) that are as blatant with how badly it will end for you and can still get people to say "Yeah, okay, I'm better than maths".

This is fairly significant given the number of sites set up on the premise that they do not have to apply for a license.
Annual Fees for a casino start at £3,000, even if you aren't taking in any money.
If you are betting on the outcome of real life events, the first year will cost you at least £13,529.00 in application fees and licensing.
These are the lowest tier of licensing available - if you take in more money, the fees go up.
Even the minimum developer fee is  £6,765.00 per year.
Play with the fee calculator (remember, hit next until you get to the Remote tab for online gambling) if you are curious, they get really expensive.
The big thing here is that it seems no one got proper legal advice before opening.
We should all remember the exchanges that cared not for KYC laws in places they were required to follow them - those exchanges are no longer with us.
The gambling sites are generally normal websites, they don't hide behind Tor and can easily be shutdown.
If sites outside the UK haven't personally sought legal advice and are just relying on what someone on Reddit or Bitcoin Talk said I suggest they visit lawyers.
If this shows us anything it is that Bitcoin Gambling sites may need licenses in more places than we assumed and just because laws don't use the word Bitcoin that doesn't mean they don't apply to Bitcoin sites.

There is 0 reason for them to just sit and wait until the donation barrier is broken, especially if it is taken a while. They'd make more accepting taking 0.25 Bitcoin donations on 4 works than waiting the same period until the first hit 0.5.
It may never get there but they've already created their next release and it would have done 10 times as well... if only your platform allowed it to be published.

A keypair is the combination of a private and public key.
If you have a private key you can derive the public key from it.
If you have a public key you can verify a given phrase was signed with the private key that created that public key.
You cannot create (or discover) the private key from the public key with a good algorithm.
Essentially most Bitcoin transactions are a message that is signed by the private key that created the public key to which the Bitcoin belongs. "send my money - signed person who owns it".
When you send it to an address, you essentially assign it to their public key, so when they spend it, their signiture has to match the key you gave it to.
With a hash, the only way you can verify someone knows how to create it is for them to give you all the things that went into creating it, such as their password, create it for yourself and see if it matches the hash you want to verify.
With passwords, that is terrible because you need new passwords for every site - if you never give sites the private details, such as with signitures, you can use the same private key for EVERY site and even if you sign up to a dodgy site it doesn't matter.
If you used a password, a scammer could start a website, take your email address and password, then later see if that password also unlocked your email account or your bank account or your reddit account.
They can't do that with signed text because the text itself is random and long enough that no two sites will realistically create the same random string - this can be compounded if each site includes something unique to the site - such as the name of the site.
Eg: If you signed into Reddit by signing "Reddit.com&lt;RANDOMSTRING&gt;" and you went to a scam site that tried getting you to sign something begining with "Reddit.com" you would be rightfully suspicious because you would know they were trying to get you to unlock Reddit.com for them.

Yup - there are a few ways to denote ownership, but the most common is "Control of these coins belongs to the owner of this address", you can also go with "Control of these coins belongs to the person with the right password" - which may not be safe if done wrongly, but is possible.
The address coins are assigned to only needs to be a valid - you could send coins to a valid address that no one owns, the coins are lost forever but it explains how you can create addresses offline and know that the key to that address has never been seen by say... malware or viruses.
It isn't like an email address where someone needs to receive the coins.

Bitcoin teaches a lesson about what to do with the current system - nothing.
Bitcoin doesn't contain a dollar section or a dollar conversation plan.
It just exists in parallel and people do the travelling between. When there is no one on the fiat side we can shut the door.
Our next political system needs to do the same.
It shouldn't be a reformation or collaboration with the existing government. It won't be a huge revolution where everyone joins in all at once. 
People should just be making the change and living that life now.
When there's no one on the other side, we'll shut the door.

Well, that depends on how they got the Bitcoins - they could be a very early adopter as well as an investor.
It isn't like you can liquidate that many Bitcoins without crashing the price so you have to find something you can buy with them.
If it cost significantly less than the current value of Bitcoin to obtain them they still did well.

This made me nostalgic.
When I started using internet it was the first thing I learned the details of.
    helo &lt;enter&gt;
    ...
I remember it vividly every time I hear the song 'Hello, is it me you're looking for', can never remember who by.
Back when I started we had it way easier than people do now.
The first thing I did was send an email to myself testing it worked and that was cool... but the second thing I did was change the 'from' address.
Back when I started that used to work almost everywhere, no questions asked - you could send an email from anyone and you didn't need a password.
It was the fun of poking around that lead me to be a software developer - you don't get that anymore. Spam ruined a perfectly good prank.
It is amazing how far everything has come - my first two computers combined are less powerful than this phone.
I've seen first hand how much has been achieved and see similar potential for crypto currencies to develop.
It wasn't particularly difficult but it wasn't elegant or intuitive either.

Smaller micropayments are dreaded blockchain bloat.
More importantly, unless you have start up capital to send reporters out on the field, you are asking if I would pay a website to take information from other websites and summarise it for me.

Why? You can use a signed challenge/response system to prove ownership of a key without that key needing to hold any money - in fact, without needing to consult the blockchain at all.
It would then be easier to use different keys for different sites.

1) People should not receive their vote from the government, the government should receive their vote from the people.
This is where the using a currency to vote with does not quite work.
2) I think you missed their point - if your vote is public and you can prove to me who you voted for, I can offer you money if you will vote for me because I would be able to check you really did it.
I actually think this is a red herring. If I was trying to keep the status quo, this would be the argument I used.
It ignores the fact that the current system is a lot more open to mass corruption and that you could never achieve anything nearly as bad by bribing individuals.
The mass corruption that happens now does a lot more damage than could be done by paying people to vote for you - if you actually had to pay every individual off and not say... a few hundred congressman things might get expensive.
There are worse things than people changing their mind for money and the fact is, if you are really worried that rich people can just buy elections and have anything they want then you have not been paying attention to the current system.
Even if it meant some people were bribed, bribery is still illegal by itself and an open system would prevent so much other corruption it would be worth it. If you consider the selling of votes to be a problem - I'm not sure I do.

SHA256 being compromised wouldn't let them spend funds, it could allow them to flood the network with blocks.
That would kill confidence in Bitcoin, we wouldn't so much fork as move to alt coins.
Bitcoin would be over, with all the money thrown into mining equipment and buying Bitcoin made useless it would take a long time for faith in cryptocurrencies would be nearly dead.
It would be forever before it recovered.

It may be no secret that the Apple world is closed on Reddit, but you speak to a person with an iPhone on the street and tell them that there is a 3 month waiting period to have a dictionary approved by Apple before you can sell it, that if your dictionary contains swearwords it never gets approved and that Apple can delete apps from your phone from their office, they'll be shocked.
They don't get money from Amazon's app store (that sells android apps) either.
The android may be known as the Google Phone and it does come with a lot of Google Tech, but it isn't *just* a Google phone and again other people provide competing services for the Android already. Google knew that going forward - the android phone was designed that way.
Google never really reacts to competition, they just improve their own offerings and hope people will choose.

I agree (which is why we've talked so much on the subject!).
The subject excites me, that's why I'm working on it.
The frequency of these posts is picking up - we need a subreddit so we aren't hijacking crypto threads all the time - I think there's enough of us that there would be value in it.
What strikes me is how much there is to know about voting before you can design a system to handle it, there are so many variations and caveats between countries and I think initially the system would have to support each country's current vote counting method - First Past The Post, Single Transferable Vote, etc, before transitioning to a direct democracy.
As a developer its easy to pick a version of Direct Democracy and build software that forces that method and I don't think it would gain traction the same as it would require multiple changes to elections at once.
By supporting multiple methods countries can begin by changing nothing about their country except the voting mechanism then move to changing how that affects government and then begin to look at Direct Democracy.

Has been interesting.
On transaction sizes, I'm a little more familiar with this because I coded something to parse the binary encoded transactions that nodes send in reply to another post to see how long it would take - not quite, they can vary based on the number of inputs and the size of scripts. Only a tiny bit mind you. 
A transaction is made up of input and output transactions.
Each transaction can have a variable amount of inputs and outputs and each input and output can vary in size.
If you feel like reading for a long time go here -  - it easier to look the map though - 
Because of the header at the start of transactions and the fact that there would only be 1 or 2 output transactions (your receiving addresses), it is more efficient to group them into one big transaction.
Take 10 dust transactions:
To collect them into 1 big transaction, you end up with 1 "header", 10 input transactions and 1 output transaction.
If you do the same in 5 transactions, you end up with 5 headers, 10 input transactions and 5 output transactions.
It is ever so *slightly* more efficient to do one big transaction than two little one because it has to repeat the headers and receiving addresses.
It is very possible to gather dust, I've been playing with it on the Test Net though I don't know of any client that gives the option.
What I have been working on is a dust cleaner - you give it your public address, it collects all your unspent transactions into one big transaction back to that address. As this can be done without your private key, you don't have to give me anything except the address which is public.
Before the transaction actually takes place, you have to sign the transaction yourself(hopefully after verifying all your money really is going back to you) and paste it into somewhere like this -  - to broadcast it.
As long as you kept enough data about the parts you pruned and first syncronised with the network to get the whole view, an offline client could very well work this way. You do need to syncronise first to make sure the chain of blocks you are receiving belongs to the real chain of blocks and not an orphaned one.
It would also be nice to see some clients using a more developer [friendly protocol then what we have\(]( JSON with gzip) that might be slightly less efficient to transmit but are more accessible.
I think there is room to develop how clients communicate so that it would be possible to say.. get the history of X transaction which you can verify it is correct by comparing it to your pruned block tree but realistically, if you can verify the last transaction is unspent you don't need to know where it was before hand as long as you can confirm that the block calling it unspent is valid and up to date.
My prefered solution for now to have my devices connect to a full node that I run - that way I get the confidence that comes with having a full client but the ability to use devices that don't have room to contain it.

Private in that they are run by corporations and not the government and because of that their contracts with the government enable them to get paid for prisoners they don't even have out of the tax payer's pocket. Sweet contracts given to friends of important politicians. Not the free market at work. It isn't public - you think if you or I tried to set up we would get the prison contracts?


Not morally, but if you are the government there is a financial optimum. The moral discussion is irrelevant to how the government acts, you should know they don't act morally - that is why there is a drug war.
The government has contracts where they will be paying the company running the prison a minimum capacity amount.
As an example lets say that contract states the government will pay for a minimum of 500 prisoners.
If there are more than 500 prisoners, the government pays the company extra per prisoner.
If there are only 400 prisoners, the government still has to pay the company for 500.
Therefor, in this case - 500 prisoners costs the government just as much as 400, so it means that 500 is "optimimum" as far as costs go (maybe 600 works out better, who cares - for the point of this conversation, you can see that 400 is definitely not cost effective for law enforcement because an extra 100 wouldn't actually cost them more money but it brings the cost per prisoner down - which looks better on reports).
There is in some cases, most definitely a financial optimimum.


And re-election campaigns, stats, amount of space allocated to various types of offenders, etc - there are lots of factors at play.
Sure, you could arrest 100% more drug dealers than you did last year but if you are Obama Fox News will be saying that Drug Crime went up 100%, if you are George Bush it will be CNN saying it.
By the time the news reaches the media, it won't look like you are doing better at tackling crime, it will look like crime is out of control.

I see my actual questions on whether donations improve your ratio and whether you need to maintain a ratio of 1:1 to keep your account open were sidestepped and those were the important notes from what I said - without that part you don't even need to read any of what I said. If they don't charge for ratio improvements and mandate a set ratio my post doesn't even apply to them.
If they are taking in more money than they are spending, that is a profit. Just because the admins like running it, that doesn't mean it cannot be profitable.
If they have a product they sell and a customer base, what part of that doesn't make them a business?

Not likely.
Here is an example private key: 5JyirZRqBG9r6rfN8roFjm1kAgFEr6Qypng3NsCKQmkwJfybUfH
Someone would need to get the exact same private key as you originally got to have access to the funds, if they are generated randomly the odds are crazy against.
I considered writing a small app to "mine" private addresses (create lots and lots to see if they could create one that was already in use) to demonstrate how hard it is to get funds that way but the odds are so against it that it seemed a little pointless.
They likely won't do anything but sit there.
If it makes you feel better, other people have lost larger sums this way.

Given how unpopular Bitcoin and Litecoin are they'd either need to have access to a big audience or a specific audience to get hits.
Economically, even the money taken from the OP doesn't justify this unless it was made by someone with big reach.
