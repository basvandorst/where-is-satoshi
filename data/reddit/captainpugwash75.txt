Absolutely not worth it in the slightest. In the early days you could mine bitcoin on a laptop (like very very early days) but not anymore.

@_date: 2018-08-15 21:56:34
Not at all feasible with a conventional computer... to mine bitcoin you need an asic (special chip dedicated only to working out calculations that relate to bitcoin mining)

How much is Ripple the company even valued at? a 700K fine seems large for such a new company. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:24:22
Well let me be clear I am for bitcoin and open ledger controlled by miners. But for cryto currency the Mining controls the issuance of currency, and would be an alternative to quantitive easing. Banks may or may not want to trial it in the future...it is not impossible.

$600K a bitcoin? how? 
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:18:16
Well, in this case the miners and bank are the same entity. In this paticluar case, it would be the bank owning and controlling. Just like if it was a FEdcoin or BankofEnglandcoin. I wouldn't want to use them but it would fit this scenario.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:58:39
But what if a company wants a private ledger running only on their systems for an alternative use?

Explain the math of this someone please it seems wildly erroneous 
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:26:35
We never had a way to send an assigned value over a public ledger with no third party. Using a sha 256 public ledger to assign value is the Solution 
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:55:30
Ofcourse they will always be against it. Before crypto nobody challenged them. Now they are forced to share space...they have created money out of nothing and used it for all kinds of wrongs . Now crypto seeks to reclaim some sovereignty to the people imo they would love to see it quashed because it’s competition.   Remember what lord rothchilds said “ give me the ability to create a nations money and I care not who makes its laws” 
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:38:33
No I said value not message

How would you send value to a country on a band list ? With no third party?

Yeah bit its sha256 elliptic curve?  Try and take my bitcoins if you can.
@_date: 2017-01-12 13:20:33
Ah ok, but where do I input the private key? when I open the encrypt/decrypt option it only has a field for "public key"
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:27:34
Are you saying bitcoin has not invented anything new because if you are.you are simply wrong 
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:44:21
You are arguing semantics here but if I send you a bitcoin it is a message of sorts but it has a huge value attached for goods and services rendered or whatever but it is done over a trustless ledger, that’s it. Yes it’s a POW system but it did not exist before bitcoin. Operable word here value 
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:15:39
That page will not load for me. What I am trying to say is before bitcoin there was no blockchain technology bitcoin solved distributed trust over a public ledger that’s why it is revolutionary 
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:50:24
It’s a lot of computers searching frantically for an answer with a very very hard difficulty. They will get there eventually but yes it can take longer than 10mins 
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:05:44
What do you mean? 
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:09:40
Even if there was only one coin in existence as all the others got lost that would still be 100 million individual satoshis
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:48:30
Or you and me 
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:31:24
So are you saying that bitcoin has not invented anything new at all? Is that it? 
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:48:20
You me and the bank 
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:23:25
Thats why I use reddit, you don't know shit about me. even if you had blockchain information that tells you little.
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:47:50
Yes a bank a third party 
@_date: 2017-01-04 10:45:33
So why bother to comment at all?
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:18:22
Ah so the fault tolerance is a network determining which system has failed but reaching a consensus. Not the same at all.

You arguing miners are a third party difference being the miners don’t have to know you or I 
@_date: 2019-03-03 12:57:10
Who gives a fuck honestly . Bitcoin has been attacked and shit on since day 1 aaaand it’s still here and has value and will continue. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 19:48:15
Fuck off 
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:32:52
Yes it does. Before bitcoin how would you send value to someone you didn’t know with trust you wouldn’t be scammed? With absolutely no third party??
@_date: 2017-01-10 12:48:44
Bout treefiddy
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:44:54
This is a bit wishy washy really, and sending money via bitcoin dosn't happen "instantly". I think we are still waiting for Bitcoins killer app before it goes moon bound. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:58:14
You have never heard of the Byzantine generals problem?

Moreover how would you send value anywhere in the world instantly (Block time accounted for ) 
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:41:23
Are you sure that's right? Did you factor in the doubling time?
Bitcoin has grown 44.9% this year! (blockchain size) from 50,787MB to 92.262MB Thats in one year. If it steadily grows at 44% it will double every 1.5 years exponentially. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:33:58
Wonder how they caught these guys on the dark web? Surely that would have been very difficult? Anyone know?

Ok well what is the probability of a false positive in this regard? 
@_date: 2019-02-14 17:41:08
Well no but they allegedly obfuscated the law, which is the issue. They may have caught a criminal but themselves broke the law and who makes them accountable?
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:11:29
You try sending gold anywhere you will find this out
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:26:27
How is gold instantly transferable may I ask?

PayPal is good for sending money via the app.... I would never use bitcoin in its place. And the argument that bitcoin is easier to use than PayPal is patently false.  only becuase I have wanted to split a bill and used PayPal for this reason. I have bitcoin too but would never use it in this scenario.

@_date: 2017-09-12 07:46:23
That's a nice find :) ...but also outlines when you think about it why bitcoins will be deflationary by nature. They'll be so many wallets people forget passwords to and will be unable to get the private key for over time....Bitcoins lost forever.

Bitcoin needs it's critics, both well informed and ill informed. If they are ignorant then they can educate themselves, but yet they may still hate it. If they truly grasp it I think it's like a big light turning on in your head.

To create a bitcoin costs a tremendous amount of computing power, + electricity , it is scarce being capped at 21M. Yes it is maths but also as the difficulty increases alot goes into finding that sum to the complex math.

I don’t think you have any chance at all. Zero chance. It was an exit scam.

From what I gather bitreserve is like coloured coins and ultracoin

We already know from Snowden leaks that agencies use tactics such as "Destroy, Deny, Degrade, Disrupt, Deceive" They are using these tactics widespread...Don't you think some of it is being used to discredit bitcoin?

Well the Government spies on EVERYONE then expects people to comply with bull shit laws. It is your duty as good citizens to stand against such wanton hedgemony! 
EDIT: And dontate to snowden or who ever the fuck else because no one is stopping a bitcoin payment going anywhere, fuck em.

Actually no it is not, it is a new technology, nascent only been around for a few years. I can assure you it is a very different from tulips, sea shells and pretty rocks. You can believe whatever you want to though ;)

You would think given the pernicious nature of botnets they would have already exploited the bitcoin system and be in the criminal business already. The article only says it's currently only research which leads me to believe there is something stopping this sort of behaviour already in place?
@_date: 2015-03-31 11:29:22
I see what you mean regards to apathy of the majority concerning bitcoin. Although I think it is enough that bitcoin exists at all, rest assured they can't stop its use even making it illegal will not stop it, and only push it to other countries where it will flourish. Bitcoin adoption IS rising, we can't expect overnight adoption of the mainstream..and actually it wouldn't be good anyway. Slow and steady is fine for bitcoin right now safe in the knowledge of its anti-fragility, it's doing OK.

Shows every transaction but little else, you cannot link easily to a specific indivdual. Unless that individual is subject to due process of law. It makes it much harder for anyone to commit blanket surveillance and know who is who.
EDIT: Also don't forget about dark wallets, coin mixer/tumblers, TOR, VPN's and privacy based operating systems.

I am ready to stand up like everybody else for freedom, Bitcoin is more than money, it is more than an exchange of bits. It is greater than the sum of its parts. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:48:58
Bitcoin lives, it can't be undone. I laugh at you .
@_date: 2015-03-27 13:35:36
Well you can regulate the on and off ramps...into and out of fiat, But not what happens inside the protocol, peer to peer exchange of bitcoins. And there in lies the issue the more people use bitcoin the less the need to use any sort of ramp/exchange into fiat. (which happens slowly but surely )
@_date: 2015-03-27 19:08:44
The currency will collapse eventually, Bitcoin is already a store of value, it does not need to be a de facto currency to live, and it cannot be shut down. It leaves options open for the little people.

The fact he is on the council of foreign relations should tell you all you need to know about this person. Elitist speaker of the establishment.
@_date: 2015-03-29 12:47:27
I don't know how it will play out, I just know bitcoin is diametrically opposed to the political and banking zeitgeist. It's fun to watch but you have to be real, they could peg it to a crypto currency absolutely but you can bet they would want it to be one they have control over.//like a goldman sachs coin or something haha ;-/

Thankfully for us, bitcoin makes it extremely hard for anyone to halt its march onwards
EDIT: nearly impossible

Fact for everyone here not up for debate: All fiat currencies no exceptions go to ZERO.

"Whether it's spy resistant or Kim resistant doesn't matter." Woaaaahhh there/ of course it matters. We know that the NSA and there ilk are spying. A mega net ( OPEN SOURCE ) is the antithesis of digital eyes on all of us.

Make sure electrum is connected to the network indicated via the green bottom left network icon

Yes all well and good in theory but the powers that be would NEVER allow Oil to be priced in bitcoin. That would be suicide for the global elite and the military industrial complex. That would mean they couldn't finance perpeptual war and enslave the population through inflation/taxation. 
Don't ever believe this could happen, it won't. The best you can hope for is the slow adoption of bitcoin into the main stream., and its doing OK.

Bitcoin will win out - ALL paper money ( yes even plastic water proof ones) go to ZERO in the end. There are no exceptions to this rule. FACT. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 11:47:13
Well in the case of the USA it's also because you have had the world reserve currency. This has allowed your leaders to over stretch themselves and be the "policemen of the world" as many a politican have said.  There is a demand for those fiat $$ globally because of oil trade.

I want him to eat those words...
@_date: 2015-03-27 17:19:18
There is a due process of law with entities of interest and they can be caught. Mostly because there is a fiat/exchange cross over. Financial records and subpoenas would not help at all if trade happens completely within the protocol with measures taken to cloak identity. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 19:23:55
You just took my words out of context, I was disagreeing with your statement.

Dingo dollars look ridiculous anyway...infact all paper money looks ridiculous. We are all kept in quiet submission by tacit approval of using pieces of paper as currency...I can't wait to see bitcoin gain traction.
