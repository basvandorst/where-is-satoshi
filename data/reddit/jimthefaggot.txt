Ok i'll bite. How is it relevant?
@_date: 2014-10-30 08:27:44
Well since you say so i'm totally convinced!

Appraisel sites are total bullshit. No idea why they exist or why anybody would use one.

Many online services require 1 to 3 confirmations. So you have to wait up to 1 hour to be able to use your money. 
That's why i prefer things like Paypal and credit cards, which are instant and secured against theft and fraud. 
Edit: so let me get this straight. Because i prefer to use Paypal i get downvoted? Really?
You people really should look up what the voting system is for because this is just as pathetic as it gets.

Very. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:53:31
Why exactly?
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:43:42
ZOOOMGG!! ALL CAPS!

I hardly see any real enemies. Banks and governments are reacting not too bad so far. The media kinda sucks but could be worse. 
At the moment Bitfinex i guess. The shorters there are taking the price down.

What are you? 15?
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:19:12
I'm willing to learn from you. Why don't you explain us what will happen exactly? As we are on a Bitcoin sub it will benefit us all, right?
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:20:49
You don't. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 09:59:26
I bet they can't wait to all move to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 07:53:17
Sure. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:08:34
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 12:26:47
Look at the date man.

In situations like this they should have as many contact options for the customer as possible. This looks shady as hell and just makes things worse. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:02:40
No really, please answer me. Why exactly? What will happen during the next financial crisis? Everyoooone will move to Bitcoin or something? Or what are you aiming at?
@_date: 2014-10-31 10:12:03
1: Yes, look at the sidebar. 
2: Is there ever anything not Bitcoin related according to you cultists?
3: This could and has happened to Bitcoin companies as well. Bitcoin user affected. 
4: There is no evidence and no reason why this would drive people to a decentralized system. It's something you made up because you live in Bitcoin fantasy land.

"The op is critical of Bitcoin's success so he is a troll". 
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:35:50
So, nothing?
