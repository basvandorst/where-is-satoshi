If you don't want a cold storage, you can move your BTC to an android wallet. Like that your private key on a device close to you. Keep a backup of those keys on a USB stick and put them in a safe.

TIL : "BitCoin" in french sound like "BiteConne" who mean Penis-Pussy

Long time ago (1994), Italien police raided ALL BBS node in italy who provide FidoNet service (email/forum service) because some users talked about piracy.  159 confiscated.  Can't wait to see that again for each blockchain node in Italy.

Partnership and signed contract are binary. It's there to be sued or not.

Facebook probably not at the moment, however  we can imagin a dencentralized social network who can use their own blockchain to manage internal currency.  Eg:  users from independant server A, can trad with users from independant server B.
@_date: 2015-09-07 11:03:46
Or monotheism vs polytheism. 
If each forum can have they own point schem like reddit, google+, phpBB, facebook, we can expect to see internal crypto-currency on very local field of applicaton too.   If Tatiana can get her own Coin, it's maybe not very practical for a lot of reason we know, but she is able to do it and that the beauty of it.

In astrology, GEMINI, are associate to 'exchange', 'commerce', but 'scam' and 'thieves' too. Did you did that on purpose ?
@_date: 2015-10-27 10:46:06
Because they are not "large market places" and it's a way to show artificials activities to get more users.
