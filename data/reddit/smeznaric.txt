OK, that was the second part of my question, if it can be upgraded. That's comforting to know. Would something like quantum computing still blow it all out though?

Yeah I guess it depends on whether quantum polynomial time algorithms contain NP-complete or not. I don't think we know this either way yet, but I could be wrong. If they do it might be unsalvagable. But so will many other encryption methods. You could build a new currency based on quantum key exchange though.

Would you really just after it had dropped by 90%? Wouldn't you have some doubt in your mind? I'm wondering if you're not misestimating your psychological reaction at that point.

I think you meant remove three zeroes. So to develop 50 supercomputers that would only take on the order of days to break this it would take ~ 53 / 3 * 15 = 53 * 5 = 265 years. Is 256 bits what Bitcoin uses to legitimise the transactions? Can Bitcoin algorithm be adapted to increase this if needed? And I guess quantum computing would blow this up entirely.

That's basically what I was looking for. But I think the calculation for 60 years is not correct. The poster assumes doubling every year so in that case it multiplies by 1000 in 10. So the breakpoint is then around 30 years away, or 45 years with the usual 1.5 years Moore's Law. I didn't check the 0.65 bn years estimate from the post.
So a few decades is quite a short lifespan for something like a currency.

What is S2X?
