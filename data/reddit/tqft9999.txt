" A question I don’t know the answer to is: can you write a Bitcoin transaction that imposes conditions on a UTXO that propagate?  That is: can you write a transaction such that whoever spends the UTXO must impose the same condition on their transaction output?"

That's the problem I want a local source so I don't have to deal with Customs and friends.
Coinabul has a local outfit but reports here on them aren't glowingly positive.
Customs says this

I had a window of opportunity in 2009 when it made sense - the difficulty was always going to increase.  End of Jan to late April at which point it became pointless as I needed the machine and not much was happening.
A few months when the price started moving I thought I remember that.  Then it really climbed - hmm must do.
