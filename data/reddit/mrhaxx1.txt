There's no safe way of doing it, *but* according to some previous trends (that are not at all indicative of future trends), the price tends to shoot up, it'll stay there for a few days at most, then it'll go down again. It's not very often it shoots up, and then it stays there, and then goes up again. But it's a gamble regardless, but it's a gamble that *can* pay off.
I mean, had you timed things perfectly, you could've double your amount of bitcoins, by selling at 20k and buying again at 10k again. For some, that would be worth the risk.
If you were to attempt the buy-low-sell-high strategy, I'd recommend dedicating a set amount of money to it and hodl the rest, so you can only lose that amount of money. **DON'T** try to daytrade with everything at once.

Face recognition by itself is not innovation.
The way they've implemented this specific type of face recognition is innovation. It's by far the most secure implementation of face recognition that has been seen in a smartphone so far.
Just like Vivo has integrated their fingerprint reader under their screen. That's innovative, despite fingerprint scanning by itself not being innovative.
Samsung is making flexible displays. Displays by themselves are not innovative, but making them flexible is.
You get my point?
New implementation or improvements of existing technologies is (and should) be considered innovative.
Otherwise, what would you consider innovative?

Right, I'm just saying that Vivo were the ones who released it, as it doesn't really matter what innovative things are going on in a lab, if it's not released.
You're completely right in it being slow, but it should still be considered innovative imo, even if it's not perfected yet, it's a pretty important first step. Ideally it should also cover the entire screen, but again, first step.

1. Create wallet
2. Write down passphrase and give it to your mom (or equivalent) and tell her to NOT give it back before it has hit 100k

This wasn't BTC, but in ETH. And the trade itself wasn't bad, it was the fact that I had accidentally enabled Stop Loss.

And I'd agree with that. It will very likely drop 20% at some point, but then OP will be sleeping, working or being social, and then he'll have missed it. It's better to just buy now and HODL. Those couple of hundred of bucks is about won't make a huge difference in the long run.

In personalfinance and legaladvice, things are generally pretty specific to people's situations. It's hard to google those things. Same goes for cycling (sometimes). I don't know about news.
Where as here on r/bitcoin we get inane questions like
* Is this a good time to invest???
* Is it worth investing $10???
* Is Bitcoin a bubble????
* When is it going to dip? When will it hit 25k?
* Is it worth mining Bitcoin on my Samsung Galaxy S3 and Raspberry Pi?
I'm not blaming newbs for not knowing those things, but all those things are VERY easy to Google, and there are excellent resources in the sidebar. I firmly believe if one isn't able to find such simple information without asking Reddit, one shouldn't even be thinking about investing in Bitcoin - or in anything else, really.
Good questions that are maybe specific to people's situation (like, if they live in some weird country with shitty laws, and they need an alternative way of buying bitcoin) generally gets upvoted and properly answered.

Yeah, but as long as you acknowledge it as a risk you're willing to take, they should be fine with it (assuming your parents are sensible people). It's not $10k you're investing, which would probably massively fuck your family over, if you lost it, but just $500. Show them articles about experts saying it'll hit $40k in 2018, and explain that if you invest $500 now,  you'll have $1000 once it reaches $25k. And by that time, you can cash out your initial $500, and just let the other half stay as an investment. There's VERY little risk in this.
If nothing else, they should just see it as a lesson for you, in case you lost it.
A friend of mine got permission to spend a decent amount of his money to gamble on football, when he was 15. His mom viewed as following: If he loses the money, it's a cheap price to pay for a life-lesson. If he gets solid profits, then that's good as well.

It's a considerable dip as it is. MAYBE it dips further, but I don't think you want to run that risk.

There's a bar not too long from my work that accepts it.
I'll also set it up at my mom's store at some point, if only to spread awareness. 
Otherwise I haven't seen any stores. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:45:57
I don't think many people disagree on it being a better idea to store bitcoins in own wallet.
The issue is just you linked a very old article with very old statistics. Had you linked an article that investigated the state of things in 2017, I think it'd look a bit better. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:17:09

Yeahh -- but as I said, I'm fairly certain if a 2 million DKK suddenly transferred to a regular danish bank account, the bank will ask "hey what's the deal with this??"

I really fucking wish people would read my other comments in this thread before commenting.
If you had done that, you'd know that I agree with people not being able to afford shouldn't gamble on bitcoin. I was just explaining *why* someone with a $100 investment would freak out over dips.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:45:42
That's something that would absolutely not happen in Denmark. People don't randomly strike up conversation, and absolutely not about something as random as bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-06 17:30:57
I mean... why not do that?
They like the idea of Bitcoin, and and the $500 is obviously not to just throw away on games or something. It's a risk, but $500 is not the end of the world, considering the potential profit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:03:42

You could also just spend some bitcoin earnings on a new GPUs.
I didn't invest that long ago, and I can buy a couple of GPUs with my current profit.

Fam, just take out your initial investment.
That way you won't have lost the money you've invested, but you can still gain massive profits from what you've already gained.
Unless you've got a reason for taking it out, like you have to buy a house now, medical shit, debt or whatever, just HODL.

Because the golden rule here is to invest what one can afford to lose.
I honestly use Bitcoin as a savings account, but that's because I'm a teenager with a lot of disposable income, so if I lose the savings, I'll manage. And if the savings triple (like they've already done), the happiness gained from that, will be much bigger than the sadness from eventually losing my savings.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:57:05
Yes, and chances are that the impact of that are lesser than those of a poor college student losing $100.

I just refreshed it without cache, and the same thing happens. No matter the number I use, as long as it contains a comma, it'll throw an error message.

My mom has a very popular beauty salon and she's going to accept Bitcoin some time next month.
She does it because:
1. It's one more payment option (which is good for everyone)
2. She wouldn't have to pay taxes (before she cashes out, anyway)
3. Spreading the good word of Bitcoin is a good thing to do
4. Why not? I mean, it doesn't really cost anything to setup, and if people won't use it (which we really don't think they will just yet), nobody has lost anything.
It is true that Bitcoin could end up being useless, and as such it might seem weird to accept it as payment, but realistically, she has very little to lose (with next to no customers who would actually pay in bitcoin soon) and a lot to win.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:11:57
$100 might be a lot more for those people than the millions you've invested is for you.

Follow the meme; buy and ***HODL***
Don't ever sell, only invest.
Feel free to wait for a drop to buy again, but you risk that never happening. You can also just buy now and ignore the fact you lose a bit of *potential* money if a drop comes. In the long run, you'll (probably) profit massively.

@_date: 2017-12-17 11:51:56

I considered taking out my initial investment, but since it has only doubled recently, I could only think of it as me cutting my potential future profit in half.

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:15:33

I actually did something very close to what OP is doing. 
Two weeks ago I decided I wanted to invest a LOT more, so I simply bought my friends share of bitcoin for its value. 
Nobody had any issues and everyone is happy.

I can assure you that I've got at least a couple of thousands invested. That's probably not a lot to you, but again, it's a lot of money to me.


You read my statement in a pretty odd way, if that was your conclusion from it.
I half-agree with the rest of your comment, just the verification shouldn't be mandatory. Alternatively, just an optional verification for *when* one initially invested in bitcoins would be considerably better.
I mean, my mom owns about 5 bitcoins, and she really doesn't know shit about it. She just HODLs. Her advice is pretty useless compared to someone who only own 0.20 bitcoin, but has been into it for years.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:58:26
Sorry about that, man
I'm 20 and I'm in my gap year before I start university next year, and I've gotten myself a really sweet job. Living in Denmark (and living at home) has made it MUCH easier for me. But I realize I'm a lucky fuck, and it's literally only due to lucky circumstances that I can invest $1000 without worrying too much.
But then there are people on this subreddit who have invested $20k, and I'm being jealous as fuck about them.
It's hard being completely satisfied with one's current circumstances, no matter how well one is doing at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:37:48
If people actually sell now for any other reason than buying more, they're actually fucking stupid.
Just buy now or when it gets lower. Or just HODL and do nothing. Those are the only sensible things to do.

Sell high, buy low, you know?
Sell the bitcoins as they drop, then buy more when they're cheap.
It's a pretty risky thing to do, but it does make sense.

I think this will be highly dependant on the person.

If I were to do that, I'd do the following:
Have an amount that you just HODL forever, and then have an amount that you daytrade. That way you risk losing *some* money, but it's not a huge risk at all.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:46:41
Look fam, it's all percentages.
If you invest $100, and the value of bitcoin doubles (and you sell), you'll have $200. Then it doesn't matter how big of a portion of bitcoin you have. 
I invested a couple of months ago, and my investment is almost tripled.
The same could happen to you. Or you could lose your money. Nobody knows

Bitcoin speculation/investing is not for you, if you can't even figure out how to google. If you googled for about 30 seconds in total, you'd know that bitcoin mining is extremely unfeasible for the average joe.
Hell, I don't even think you need Google. The sidebar should tell you enough about it.

If you figured out how to buy a litecoin on coinbase, surely you can figure out how to buy bitcoins?

Just curious, how do you find yourself in a situation with no internet for three months?

Is that a regular occurrence in your life?
