I mostly concur.  
-- the one thing I urgently ask you -- in order to appease those calling for bankruptcy -- is to beg/plead/force the Bitfinex people to become fully transparent with the calculations behind the 36% and their own holding/obligations/losses. And fast!

At least those have some following.  
Here BCH = Roger + Bitmain + paid sock puppets.  
The huge difference is the 1 million BCH coins (&amp; roughly $1-2B manufacturing losses of Bitmain). (The leaders of Gold  &amp; Diamond do not control such massive amounts).   
So IMHO once Roger loses interest (again!) and Bitmain is liquidated, the floodgates are wide open.

It is beneficial to have older versions run on the network - for consensus-checking purposes.  
Pre-0.15 versions would ~~alert~~ crash, which is still good - humans would take notice &amp; effectively reject the attempted inflation (block).

Well pedantically speaking, there are no "coins", but (multi-party) transactions that can be viewed/traced.  
Things are not very different than multi-party (hot) wallets on exchanges, but with you are always in control of your coins/keys and no one else understands the logical linkage between your inputs and your outputs.  
Coins going into exchanges also come from random places of course and on JoinMarket people have been mixing coins for months &amp; months trying to earn 0.0001% profit. :)  
Here you go, trace this:   
Where are the "worse" coins exactly?
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:46:12

Take a look here: 
JoinMarket, the P2P mixer (&amp; tumbler) with built-in economic incentive for people to use it (safe way to grow Bitcoin you own providing liquidity).  
Command line right now, but should become quite popular once wallet (Electrum?) integration is available.  
It's running the CoinJoin algorithm: trustless, decentralized, open source &amp; secure.

@_date: 2015-12-09 20:30:42
It depends...  
* If you are afraid of the site's operator walking away with your coins you want a decentralized solution, which keeps your keys/coins always under your control:   
* If you are afraid the site's operator will log all addresses of coins going in &amp; out -- and you want no one but you to understand/see that linkage:   
Otherwise, go anywhere else.

@_date: 2015-06-20 21:04:53
It's a new project, true.  
There will be a wallet plugin in the future (Electrum?).  
Several benefits:  
* private keys never leave your PC, your JoinMarket client just signs the merged TX  
* if you are the taker (the one mixing) - no one but you can identify your incoming and your outgoing addresses of that TX
  
First point ensures private crooks running the mixer can't steal your coins.  
Second point ensures that the security agency running the mixer(s) can't correlate the incoming to outgoing funds.

Some of these appear quite sketchy... guaranteed investment of certain percentage, bound to fail/disappear at any time.  
Take a look at [JoinMarket](  
Code &amp; Details here:   
***Elevator Pitch for Investors, from the lead developer***  
Firstly I'd like to clarify what I mean by investing. I don't want you to give your bitcoins to me. I dont want you to give your bitcoins to anybody. The private keys would be safely held on your own computer, known only by you and your wallet.
Features:  
1. Earn an income from your investment bitcoins.  
2. Very low risk. Your coins have to be on an online computer, but the software would only sign transactions that are valid and pay you the correct amount.  
3. No commitment, withdraw your bitcoins at any time.  
4. Improves the privacy of the bitcoin transactions, which makes bitcoin as a currency more useful and thus increases its value.  
5. Improves the fungibility of bitcoin, since the distinction between 'clean' and 'dirty' bitcoins will be meaningless. Eliminates this particular systemic risk to bitcoin.

(So when Bitcoin makes you parasitic bloodsuckers obsolete - it'll be too late.)
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:17:35
is an implementation of a trustless blind protocol-level mixing.  
Here's an example of a mixing cycle -- about 5 different people were putting coins together into 1 single transaction:   
If you follow each of the identical amounts for a few hops you'll see them leading to a DNM, but it's impossible to understand which of input (addresses) into this TX actually went to the DNM.
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:21:01
Agreed.

~~ELI5 please - between Aug 1st &amp; Nov 15th - how safe are Bitcoin transactions (regarding reversal)?  
I.e. those that get into the "invalid" blocks mined by the opposition, or those prone to reorg, etc. Any safe number of confirmations for the transactions made between those dates? Anything else?  
(This worries me, maybe I'm missing something.)~~

Because there is a huge propaganda machine and a couple of very butthurt millionaires behind this shitcoin. That's all.  
But it's mainly over today, thanks to the 20+ exchanges who finally got off their collective butts and rephrased what I said in my 1st sentence. :)

The Hard-motherFucking BU-llshit freaks will cause the Hard Fork &amp; their shitcoin to be born. It is clear even to the exchanges:  
"Since it appears likely we may see a hardfork initiated by the Bitcoin Unlimited project, we have decided to designate the Bitcoin Unlimited fork as BTU (or XBU). The Bitcoin Core implementation will continue to trade as BTC (or XBT) and all exchanges will process deposits and withdrawals in BTC
even if

In case those fucks fork you'll have to run their BU-llshit node code.

"The value proposition of bitcoin is in the fact that it's monetary supply is unalterable, nobody can change it."  
"Bitcoin's value is growing because it demonstrated that nobody can change it nobody **controls** it."  
"And we knows this because some of the very influential people in Bitcoin have been going insane trying to change a small metrics in Bitcoin and completely failed at it."  
"It's completely trivial for any other coin to change anything in their coin within a week." Just look at the many Eth forks, etc. Bcash trivially changed the block size, several times, can change the money supply parameters just as easily.  
"The onus of proof is not on Bitcoin, why it's better than the others. The onus of proof is on all these other coins, to illustrate to others why they can claim to be immutable."  
"And the reality is : none of them can do it".  
With shitcoins you gotta track what the hell the leader/foundation is doing -- every fucking day, if you're getting screwed somehow. But with Bitcoin you buy 21 bitcoins and you have 1 millionth of the total supply. And 20 years from now - you'll have exactly 1 millionth of the total supply.

Same bitcoin(s) can be "sent" to many different places (addresses). There are no restrictions.   
Whichever confirms (gets included in a block first) is the real transaction. Ideally you should wait for more than 1 confirmation for best security.

@_date: 2017-04-10 20:17:03
Hundreds of millions were spent manufacturing the chips with the exploit. With no clear (overt) way to recover those costs.

It is not just the other miners that he stole $100-200MM from, he stole it from us all (inhibiting progress, suppressing the price with drama).

@_date: 2017-04-10 13:42:24
It's a way for 80-90% of Bitcoin users &amp; nodes &amp; wallets &amp; exchanges to say FU to Bitmain mining cartel for blocking protocol upgrades the last year, wasting everyone's time (while stealing $100MM in the process with secret exploits: ASICBOOST, etc.).
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:05:13
The community is together already (95% of nodes are running Core).  
This is one way to get rid of the shills who are simply stalling &amp; wasting our time.  
Every day of stalling earns them close to $300K!! ($100MM/year)

@_date: 2017-04-06 05:05:30


an archilles heal for Bitcoin there is every reason to eliminate this legal vulnerability. Additionally, it's a technical vulnerability as well: we want getting into the ASIC manufacturing and design business to have as low barriers to entry as is feasible, and the ASICBOOST exploit significantly increases the minimum capital requirements to do so.
Remember that the whole purpose of PoW is to destroy value on a level playing field. Anything that inhibits a level playing field is an exploit. While this isn't standard crypto - we can't fix every exploit completely - since we're going to do a technical change to partially mitigate the ASCIBOOST exploit there is every reason to fully mitigate it.

According to the KNC study, investing hundreds of millions was too much (no way to profit), unless there was a secret advantage.  
This tells me the "lenders" knew of the exploit.  
And my theory is that no legit bank or somesuch would invest hundreds of millions into a secret exploit-based business, requiring lies to the entire world. Too risky.

Only Jihan/AntPool have the means to run the exploit on their miners (30% power savings give them ~5x-10x the profit).  
Buyers of miners &amp; chips have no way to activate that mode, nor to compete. I would be quite angry right now, had I bought a Bitmain miner.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:37:10
There is no software provided that can trigger the covert (secret) exploit. Only Bitmain/AntPool know how to do that.   
The stratum may allow someone else enter the overt ASICBOOST mode, but I haven't seen anyone claiming they did it.

No it hasn't.  
It's an attempt to delay the existing fix for ASICBOOST (SegWit) by another 1-2 years by wasting everyone's time on yet another media propaganda effort.  
To ensure Bitmain snatches another $100-200MM in the meantime.

Nah here I'm pointing out there's an org behind all this, let's call it "an agency" -- which manifests itself in this slow painful release of every piece of the evidence. Meaning that even if a coin moves -- I'd need a little more convincing on that it was done by the real Satoshi.

ditto you brown-noser
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:56:09
My guess is as good as anyone's. BTW I never openly participated in the blocksize discussion AFAIK.  
I'm thinking Gavin got turned around the time he went to that public 2011 CIA meeting. Roughly from moment on State-level actors were involved.  
What were "their" specific goals in 2011 &amp; now in 2016 -- have they shifted -- who am I to know (you wanna tell me who killed JFK &amp; why)?  
Did Satoshi name Gavin the maintainer just before he disappeared forever? That would lead me to believe that Satoshi is now dead and someone else was writing those words. :(  
People change &amp; I think that today's Gavin **wants** to be seen a clown in the eyes of the world, and is accomplishing that by supporting a fraudster -- to finally lose his usefulness to his masters &amp; be set free.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:30:04
Jihan, for better or worse, also said: fuck your mother.
@_date: 2016-05-03 12:45:57
The way I see it, Gavin's either:  
* a loon for continuing illogical support of a hoax  
* a narc for doing what his CIA handlers are telling him to do  
* or both (actually wanting to appear to be a loon to finally let the world know he's a narc w/o outright saying it).
@_date: 2015-10-30 10:22:58
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:11:19

Authorization to retrieve a private key must follow the chain of command you know. A week is blazingly fast in those circles!
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:03:22
Of course not. That's the whole point of this trustless mixer!  
For instance, starting with your list of addresses:   
Your coins were the input into this tx (~45 BTC) and the outputs were 7 outputs of equal size (~31 BTC) -- one of them is the guy you're looking for.   
And the ~14 BTC was likely also his (which was sent through the mixer with similar outcome). And so on.

is trustless, decentralized and your coins are under your control 100% of the time -- you don't sit around wondering for hours/days if you've been robbed.  
Here's an example of someone laundering 2.6 BTC with the help of other 7 volunteers (who got paid something, but way less than even honest websites take):

The usual assumption is that you control all input addresses in a transaction, especially if there's 1 or 2 outputs.  
(mixing protocol implementation) exists to nullify this assumption - where a dozen or more people collectively control the input addresses in a single transaction.

Similar underlying algorithm.  
Completely new code, out in the wild for a year or so.  
Decentralized key-signing -- i.e. you're always in control of your coins, Python code runs on your local machine.

Of course "leaders of the world" HATE any sign of freedom, i.e. DNM AKA Free Markets.

Mix them, tumble them.  
protocol-level mixer, running for over a year or so. P2P where only you know your input &amp; output addresses. Unlike web-site operators.

Can you sign? I've created a tx using my bitcoind:

**copying the text here -- not written by me, similar line of logic, though I think Gavin repented since then:**  
Many of you know me as cryptcracker, the bounty hunter that is uncovering the truth behind the Crypty "hack" and bringing the perpetrators to justice. However I have been doing this kind of work far before the cryptsy incident, I am making this dispatch today to reveal crucial information on the sudden news about Satoshi Nakamoto's identity and the plot Gavin Andresen has been involved in.
Satoshi was the greatest mind that I have seen in ages always calm and collected a real genius. Notice that I said was, that's because I'm sorry to say Satoshi Nakamoto was murdered by Gavin Andresen and his CIA associates. The CIA saw the transparency of the blockchain and they thought this would be a good way to track their "dirty subordinates". Let me explain, the CIA gives money, guns and drugs to terrorists so they can do things like stage a coup and overthrow governments this is well documented. The CIA saw the transparency of bitcoin and got the idea to start using bitcoin as one of the ways they fund these dirty subordinates. 
Gavin was given the task of identifying Satoshi and flipping on him which he did. Once Satoshi was found and about to be captured I was informed 1 of 2 things happened, Satoshi committed suicide or the authorities were successful in capturing Satoshi and Satoshi was tortured and then killed. I am sorry for not being 100% certain on which one it is but it was one of the two I know this because my sources also relayed documents to me showing Satoshis dead body and classified CIA files.   
Craig Wright was chosen as the CIA's front man to act like he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Gavin Andresen was to use his position in the community to pass this off. However these fools completely botched there plan because 1. they don't have the keys to the best of my knowledge and 2. they over estimated their manipulative tactics. The CIA got used to pulling these tactics on the general population but they didn't understand something this transparent wouldn't work against the bitcoin Community since it's much more tech savvy.
This was one of the saddest stories that I have known about for a while and I think it needs to get out there. I am currently hesitant in releasing the confidential CIA files because if Satoshi's identity is know his friends and family will be in danger along with my sources. I will attempt to secure them so they are not in danger once that is done I might be able to release the files.
Thank you for your time, another dispatch will be coming soon.

"EU gets closer to ending Bitcoin anonymity  
The European Commission is proposing the creation of a database that will hold information on those using virtual currencies and that will record data on the users' real-world identity, along with all associated wallet addresses."  
Good luck, because **Bitcoin gets closer to ending the EU** :D
