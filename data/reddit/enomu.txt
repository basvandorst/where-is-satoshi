This. As of now, because of its decentralization, it's the safest crypto.

For BTC, once all the coins are mined, miners are incentivized to continue mining by receiving the transaction fees as a reward. 
Yes, I’d agree to a certain extent there is some manipulation that can occur within the markets but that’s because the markets are new and small.  On a larger scale, with more adoption, any effects a large player like Mt Gox could have would be very limited. 
The overall goal is for cryptocurrency to break away from being tied to the US dollar.   Again, BTC is new so it will be tied to another currency (in this case USD) until (or if) it or another crypto becomes a standard currency.  Will that happen, I don’t know.

Slightly, confused with the wording you used but sure.
I’ll add that everyone has their own opinion on what BTC is or should be; however, I see it as a store of value similar to gold.  You wouldn’t use gold as a payment method in a restaurant, would you?

With crypto, you can have all of those things. The goal isn’t necessarily to rid the banks, but to give you absolute and safe control over your own wealth.  
One use case, look at Venezuela.  They’re govt is printing money like crazy and their people are helpless as they face hyperinflation and the their currency’s buying power diminishes.  A universal (adopted) decentralized currency protects against this.  
No one is forcing you to adopt a currency you don’t want to use.  The markets will facilitate whatever is wanted.

A network can be decentralized by having 5 different mining farms (not associated with each other) or by having 50,000 different mining farms (not associated with each other)?  Which is safer?  The latter since it is less likely 50k mining farms will join together and manipulate the network (e.g., 51% attack) compared to only 5 mining farms.  In this case, Bitcoin is the one with 50k mining farms.  Note, these numbers are made up for the sake of getting the point across.
To your second point, mining farms *can not* easily shift their workloads to any cryptocurrency.  A lot of farms of crypto (or algorithm specific) and can only mine certain coins.

The point of Bitcoin is to take power away from the banks and credit card companies and give it back to YOU.  When you own Bitcoin, no one can take it away from you.  YOU own it. YOU control it. YOU can do whatever you want with it, whenever, and wherever - not the banks.

What about the miners they are selling?  Seems odd they are selling Bitmain miners at such low cost and so many in stock.
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:00:31
yes super long

Why would anyone use these ATMs?  Isn't it easier (and maybe cheaper) to just buy BTC using a smartphone/laptop through an exchange (e.g., Coinbase)?

Is this Legit?

Is Jaxx secure to use? 
Can ethereum be affected by the potential fork and is it worth transferring it to a private wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:26:38
Is Jaxx good / safe?
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:28:44
I think one of the chain's coins (or both) will be devalued as well and thus will ultimately make the total combined value of both coins the same.  For example, you may have 1 BTC now (worth ~$3000) and then later end up having 1 BTC and 1 BCC both worth $1500 each (or one worth $500 and the other $2500).
Someone correct me if I'm wrong :)

I moved my coin's off Coinbase about 1-2 hours ago and it took approximately 30 minutes to arrive in my wallet (Jaxx).  
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:38:15
What about holding in Jaxx?
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:02:05
But it JAXX safe to use during this crisis??

Thank you so much!

+1 to this question
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:06:22
Do you include the broker's fee (e.g., coinbase) in the bitcoin purchase price?

Could you please upload the excel spreadsheet for us noobs to use :)
