I'm not aiming this comment specifically at you so I apologise if it seems harsh but I see a lot of comments like this.
I don't get why anyone here thinks they wouldn't 'get it'.
These are likely some of the brightest up and coming economic minds given research assignments to consider emerging tech and concepts and their effects in their industry. These aren't armchair experts like many here. 
A common presumtion here is that those involved in Bitcoin have some sort of mystic knowledge and understanding which the masses cannot comprehend. And those in the archaic outside system are especially resistant to understanding this true knowledge.

Most likely due to tax reasons rather than anything else

Nothing wrong with it at all. Yet it does make the title of the "biggest exporter of software and technology" a bit hollow if its just for tax.
If the tax reason disappears the real test of ROI being a true world leader in the tech sector would be if those companies stay. 
Production in china, design and coding in the US, legal and accounts likely in the US or UK. Call centers, small assembly and tax through Ireland the easiest parts to shut down and move on, be sad if it happened and I hope the ROI is making efforts to be less replaceable.

Teaches me for taking at face value what the BBC insinuated during their coverage of the tax haven stuff last year.

Problem is if it becomes a common recommendation to use a bunch of non-capitalised and unpunctuated strings of dictionary words how is it any more secure. People would put this logic into their cracking programs and it would cut down the possible combinations  dramatically.
