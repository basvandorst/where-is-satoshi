They probably do have a lot of people like yourself trying to get verified. Exchanges don’t really prepare to have a lot of people submit retire stub. I wish they would try to have a team dedicated to push through accounts getting verified. Obviously making sure it’s all legit, but still it seems most major exchanges take a while to verify new customers. 
I would say submit a ticket, but some would say you’d be 300k tickets behind. If I were in your situation I’d open the ticket, try to tweet / dm support or any other sort of their off site support team and see if they can check / prioritize you. Good luck man, don’t give up.

12wy is your address? It shows as pending so maybe just wait a little bit. When it starts getting confirms, check your balance

Change your Coinbase email to a 2 step email. Obviously someone has access to it. Regardless if you change the password, they can probably regain access. Do not continue to use that email

How did they release it? Were you locked out of your account, did you have verification problems, was your account disabled. Give more insight

Assuming support would answer their request. Lol
But definitely a lot of ways you can get fucked over buying an account. It only takes 1 ticket to have it changed back to his original email. Your funds will be gone. Have 2fa? They’ll remove that too

It would be a nightmare certainly. You wouldn’t want to back up the codes or pictures to your email. I personally just write the 2fa codes down on paper. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:02:50
Yes that would be why it’s not credited yet. Sucks, but it is what it is.

Is some quick searches and looks like your amount is small compared to what they actually took. Good luck finding them

Also tried to pay for something recently and received the same shitty type link. Was also unable to pay it. Had to pay via Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:22:48
It is a scam.

Should need to be 21 to post on reddit

A lot of pro football players go broke. Also, most of the money in football contracts is non guaranteed. Need to stay healthy / out of trouble / good at your position and many other things. Tough loss for Darren.

Order yourself a trezor, BACK THE SEED UP TO A COUPLE SECURE LOCATIONS NOT ONLINE. Spend your time away learning and growing. You’re going to come out to a nice fortune to put to use with your knowledge :)

You can download a wallet on your phone such as Jaxx and import the qr code. From there, you may send the balance of it to your appropriate Coinbase account address if you choose to

My personal thought is that if he were alive still, he’d have made a statement regarding forks / state of the market / anything. What was the last confirmed posting by satoshi does anyone know?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:23:14
Boo fucking hoo I have to pay a $50 fee (likely exaggerated) that was worth probably .25 when I got it. All to move probably $1m+ in funds. Tough life he must have had. Good riddance 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:28:48
Why can’t he. “I got hacked” prove otherwise?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:23:46
Do people actually believe this shit?

Then saying it will be available 30mins-2hours is probably just the standard auto email. Basically “it will be credited when the transaction is confirmed on the block chain” - typically 30 kind - 2 hours. Check the transaction and if it’s not confirmed, just wait. If it is, contact Gemini support and check your account periodically

Well I wouldn’t say BEST
