If you wanted to build an exchange, where would one begin to learn how?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:44:06
Got my first large position  at 17k was hoping to see it go up a bit longer. But now I'm hoping to see it go a bit lower by feb/March so I can go in on another big position.

Yeaa id love to see someone come try and repo our tanks and missiles. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:48:03
That's funny.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:42:10
Never done it, but I would guess it would involve meeting another person some where and then exchanging fiat for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:17:51
Exactly, i remember back in probably 2012 2013, buyin ounces at a couple coins a piece not giving a fuck. Those ounces could buy me a Ferrari about now. But it was hands down best I've ever had, bud wise.

its nice to be more educated on bitcoin and all that goes into than the people who are on tv and are expert "institutional investors". 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:26:02
who is this woman? Does she run cyptokitties?

Hodl on..
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:48:44
I too have a billion dollars of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:33:20
I should've just saved my BTC from back in SR days. If I had only known.

i never saw gene wilder outside of willy wonka for years and years, then i turn on the tv on day to see him in the middle of a sex scene on a train. Childhood ruined!
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:01:53
It's all how you look at it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:26:18
Oh for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:16:00
[you were saying?](
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:32:36
Just because the Wal-Mart "brand" isn't for sale, it's worth billions of dollars for the name alone. Hence why they protect it so fiercely, same with bitcoin. Just because it doesn't have a "owner" doesn't mean it doesn't have value.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:36:21
why would you use kraken for 200k? i wouldnt trust that, i wouldve gone lbc and done a person to person exchange or something similar.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:14:55
Ask jeeves tho.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:44:15
Localbitcoins.com go with bank deposit  or wire.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:10:10
I don't think you understand what my comment was implying.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:33:10
It's not a drug deal, you can do it at the local mcdonalds or whatever. With a registered handgun on you for safety, if you feel the need.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:05:52

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:04
Those are basically just IOU's basically right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:37
whats special about dec 10th?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:00
at what point do we get to throw midgets around the office and do quaaludes? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:21:15
Google play for ios
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:33:19
your best bet would probably be localbitcoins or coinbase maybe coinmama would be a place to look as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:14:57
It can buy lots and never change from bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:15:38
if anybody will actual photoshop skills, happens upon this, and wants to remake it. Id love for you too and please send me a link! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:13
What makes you think it'll go toward 10k?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:01:10
Couldn't say it better.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:27:41
It's sad that I'm not 100% sure that this is fake...i mean I know it is, but I have just a shadow of a doubt, which is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:59:03
It will, it just need the right conditions. Venezuela, Greece, etc. Could you think what would happen if us had another depression, I think bitcoin would step in at that point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:56
Bitcoin is pissing me off so bad right now. I want to buy because ive been waiting over a month for the correction, so i could buy in lower. Hasn't happened, so today i decide im going all in. EVERY FUCKING SITE is giving me some bullshit and isnt working. Fuckin shite mate, i wouldnt mind as much if i knew, i wouldnt be losing litterally thousands waiting 24 hrs.

@_date: 2017-12-27 02:48:19
We're gonna hit another 2008 or worse but bitcoin will be here this time. I'm excited.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:17:28
I try to tell people get in with 100 for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:24:54
again why would you not use localbitcoins or bank deposits for selling or buying this amount? You should know not to trust companies in this space. Feelsbadman
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:58:04
Make a script to do it for you.

took me longer than i care to admit that 7452 wasnt the amount of miles, OP drove on autopilot, but was actually the bitcoin price
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:33:08
Makes sense from a business sense. You can accept bitcoin, with little investment vs the 1000s to accept debit cards.
