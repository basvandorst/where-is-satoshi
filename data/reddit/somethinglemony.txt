Yeah sure, any metal. My point was just that physical things are always more valuable

Sorry Professor Bitcoin, didn’t realize I had entered your domain. 
I don’t really think those other examples you provided as very real or tangible either, but at least money in your bank account can be withdrawn. There is no physical form of Bitcoin. If every computer in the world lost power, there’d be no more. 
In addition, there’s a pretty narrow range of places that will accept crypto, unlike store fronts in reality, they always accept money. 
You’re lucky, Professor, that there’s enough people willing to play ethereal monopoly with made up shit, because that’s all it is. Without everybody’s collective imagination this industry wouldn’t exist, unlike logging or mining because those are real, physical resources with real, physical applications.

What! 
No, an intangible, unusable digital resource couldn’t be a scam! Unthinkable!

That’s hilarious that someone on a made-up-electronic-currency forum is so cynical about actual material riches. 
Gold doesn’t go away if you don’t have electricity. You can make circuits and useful physical things, unlike with bitcoin. It is inherently valuable, unlike bitcoin. 
If you’re gonna be cynical about anything it should be about the ethereal game of monopoly everybody is playing.

I know, I don’t like fiat. I wouldn’t disagree that USD is crap. 
I hadn’t heard of that in those other countries. I would be livid if I couldn’t pull my money out of a bank.
