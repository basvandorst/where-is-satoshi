Thanks man, I appreciate it!
@_date: 2012-10-24 23:58:53
Haha I thought so.  Great to hear from you, and thanks for the advice.  Small world indeed.  Send me an email or PM and let me know where you are in the world!  I'd love to catch up.  Oh and definitely get in touch when you get started on that BTC project, it'd be cool to know someone else working in this space.
@_date: 2012-10-23 18:39:28
Ouch.  That's unfortunate.

I guess I could see that AML could be a problem, but I checked the TOS for Amazon and elsewhere and saw nothing preventing this.  Do you know how the bitcoin exchanges not get tangled in this regard?
@_date: 2012-10-23 18:44:27
Hmm, interesting.  I offer the opposite trade where I live (cash only, of course) but so far there has been little interest.  This isn't exactly a small city, either.  Is there a better place than [localbitcoins]( to advertise?

Why hasn't someone, for example BitInstant, just set up a Stripe page to take payments with a credit card?  I could easily get a site that does this running in a week, so there has to be a reason nobody's done it.  Is it because of the fear of malicious charge-backs?
@_date: 2012-10-23 16:08:01
Thanks!  I would like to have this be a standing offer; everyone benefits when bitcoins can be used for purchasing from a wider market.
@_date: 2012-10-23 17:07:13
Yeah, you're right.  Still, suppose this weren't a manual process on my end--if I get enough interest, I can automate the purchase of Amazon giftcards.
Imagine just requesting a wallet from a website I set up, and as soon as you deposit any amount of BTC in that wallet, you get an email with a gift card for the equivalent amount.  No requirement to trust more than you're willing to, here.  The fluid transition of BTC to Amazon $ could be very useful--and again, we're cutting out the currency speculators by giving BTC instant equivalent value in purchasable goods.
Would that be interesting to you?  Is this something that already exists?
@_date: 2012-10-23 17:23:55
Is [this]( what you're referring to?  I'm not familiar.
@_date: 2012-10-23 21:04:10
Possibly, but speculation alone is not sustainable as it does not create real value.
There are innumerable examples: Pokemon cards, Beanie Babies, late 90's stock.  Even Bitcoin itself.  Remember when 1 BTC was upwards of $30?  If all you could do with bitcoins was gamble on everyone else's perception of value, things get out of hand.  The rapid discovery of over-speculation is, as I'm sure everyone recalls, very painful.  At least with MTG cards you could still play the game if nobody would buy them.  If the only thing driving bitcoin's value is speculators, we won't even have that luxury.
It's hard to say precisely whether bitcoins currently have more "speculative value" or real value right now--but this doesn't really matter.  The main thing is that it's imperative that while bitcoins have buying power we expand the goods and services that can be directly exchanged for bitcoins.  Hence, my offer. : )

Ha!  I was surprised I couldn't find anyone who had done this yet; how did you find it?  Maybe there needs to be a directory for this kind of thing.  While I'm not a fan of the fees, thanks for the link!
@_date: 2012-10-23 16:23:19
I know it's 'just' 1%, but a transaction fee and third parties goes against what I'm trying to do.  Anyone could just cash out their bitcoins for a transaction fee.
Using an escrow service assumes we both trust the service to perform the transaction and preserve anonymity, that we trust the communication medium, and that we tolerate the increased round-trip time for the transaction.  I'm hoping to make it seem like bitcoins *are* Amazon Gift Cards so that bitcoins have immediate purchasing power.  To do this, I'd like to keep the process as smooth and simple as possible.
@_date: 2012-10-24 01:13:34
That's very unfortunate.  But there must be a way!
@_date: 2012-10-24 03:50:32
Hey!  Chris S.?  E.?  Or rather, which highschool? haha.
Thanks man.  I've only had a few transactions so far but I'll just leave this as a standing offer and get on with seeing if I can make CC-&gt;BTC work. As far as Evidyon goes, after I opened up the source code back in 2010, it was forked a few times and I got a lot of requests from people making their own games.  Lots of fun. :)
@_date: 2012-10-26 16:27:17
Cool, I'll be on the watch!
@_date: 2012-10-24 01:11:50
Haha, great analogy.  I feel like there has to be a way to combat thieves and scammers, though.  Something for me to think about when I'm not filling orders, I suppose. :)
@_date: 2012-10-23 20:12:29
Has anyone done it and then been put out of business due to chargebacks, or are people unwilling to take the risk?
It seems to me that this is an argument against accepting credit cards at any store where the product is difficult to recover if a charge-back is issued.
