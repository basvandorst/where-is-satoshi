It's a scam.  It'll empty your wallets into theirs, maybe even keylog some of your other stuff.

Just fyi, anyone who vapes should make sure they get sufficient Vitamin C, [as recommended in this study of nic patch users]( to reduce risk of carcinogenic by-products.

Just fyi, Cerebral health aren't a recommended supplier (check the FAQ for better suppliers including discounts) they've sent a numbing agent to customers instead of choline bitartrate... then refused to comment on the matter.

If you have a half-decent diet, you should be getting ok amounts of choline from eggs, milk, cheese, meat, nuts, vegetables, fruit.... however if you subsist on ramen (without any vegies or meat added), then you're probably deficient.  
There are plenty of people who use piracetam without supplementing choline... but as someone else mentioned, CDP-choline is good (increases uridine levels), especially in combination with fish oil (1g DHA/day).

Go to the gym for a few hours, swim, eat lunch, home early.  Figure out what you want to do in life.

you could be rootkitted and keylogged even if your scans come back clean, you should have disconnected the PC from the internet, changed all your passwords from a different location and reinstalled.
