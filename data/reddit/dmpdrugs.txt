Everything that makes the coin better to use is done through centralization, because centralization allows for more effiency. Using a metaphorical example and then applying to crypto currency:
Humans started out as decentralized hunter gatherers, and since then centralization has been responsible for most of our improvement. Now almost no one is self sustainable, but we have better quality of life.
Everything that can make bitcoin better involves centralization. Segwit would use centralized outside companies to increase transaction speed. Larger blocksize increases cost for nodes and miners. Specialized miners mean that it's no longer anyone with a computer who can mine bitcoin. And that extends to everything, Venmo does what everyone hoped bitcoin would do because a centralized company is faster at doing things than an open source movement. If you know a way to make bitcoin significantly better that doesn't centralize it, I would honestly love to know.
Decentralizing either means outsourcing to a company (like segwit/ln would do) or making it less accessible to people at the edge of it's possible users (bigger block size).

You were asking for innovation that altcoins had made earlier in the thread
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:45:30
Bitcoin could be way more decentralized, having every cellphone be a miner, and limiting the amount of mining from any one miner, and any number of other changes. Centralization is a spectrum, not a binary. Making bitcoin slightly more centralized one time isn't gonna turn it into the fed.

A misled mistake. The title was wrong. I meant the part about how some of the developers could get bought out, and how that's what forks are for. Look at bch, the guys behind that were clearly compromised due to money, and then a fork happened and btc won out. Now it's happening again with 2x.

@_date: 2017-11-05 07:28:26
B2X still uses segwit, segwit is what Blockstream cares about. 2x is a very minor change compared to segwit. Doubling the blocksize wouldn't kill bitcoin.
Also influence is powerful, if you can influence a powerful person that's still using power. And I'm not saying they have the power to do whatever they want, I made the post to remind people that they have the power to control bitcoin if core does something stupid, you're literally agreeing with me.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:15:53

Wrong-headed? That's a scary statement, a synonym away from wrong-think. I worded my title incorrectly. Core is what you said. blockstream only supports core, and is made up of some of its contributers. Now I have learned that terminology is complicated. Perhaps someone can be wrong about terminology and it does not have anything to do with anything else?

Vertcoin uses an algorithm that makes custom hardware implausible and is best mined using GPUs, which prevents centralization and increases the power of the users. That would have prevented this whole 2x fork from happening as mining pools wouldn't have as much influence.

I meant if I was anti blockstream or something, it wouldn't matter for this fork because segwit is their whole thing. I'm just saying be careful is all

Core has been used to refer to the blockstream team, which is made up of many of the contributors to core, and which influences core design choices. But here it is mainly not used that way. In some deep parts of some deep threads here, it was used in the way I described, prompting this post.

You may be right, but there are still people who don't know, and it is a pretty important thing to know.
Intel employees working on linux code do benefit linux, but they also clearly benefit intel. Intel employees work on things like drivers that are uncontested in usefulness, and they are fine with other minimalist distros of linux that do not include those drivers. Blockstream is more complicated because there cannot be as many successful forks as there are linux distributions. Intel cannot kill off amd drivers for linux so that all linux users have to use intel. Blockstream on the other hand is against increasing blocksize, which punishes users for not using sidechains, which Blockstream is a proponent of. Sidechain projects supported by Blockstream include liquid, segwit, lightning, elements, confidential assets, and hyperledger.
Blockstream has influence over the code, and given the uncharted territorty that crypto is, which decision is best for the coin is not often known. It's entirely possible that blockstream is benefitting bitcoin and is profiting solely because they have invested in bitcoin technology. Just be aware that their investors have benefitted more than anyone from the system bitcoin is disrupting and that they have power over how it's implemented.

Okay. I'm not gonna word this post well or make an argument or complicate anything. The title of my post was wrong. Factually incorrect. I made a mistake, but people told me I was wrong, and I learned something. The point I wanted it to be about was that there are people who aren't just investing in bitcoin the currency, but in bitcoin the technology. They probably have some influence, so we should keep an eye on them.
I don't want any poop in anyone's water. I don't like any kind of narrative, I try to avoid them so I can just get the truth of the thing. I thought the information about Blockstream was important to bitcoin so I posted it here. I like bitcoin because its forkable. That's the whole thing, it's an experiment, it doesn't need to be one thing. That's what fiat is for. Forking is the ultimate decentralization.

Why would I shill when I own bitcoin? Bitcoin's current growth is being drived by investment bankers, literally nothing on reddit would change that. Even if blockstream is funded by extremely rich special interests who are influencing development, that still means that core is the most profitable thing to invest in, as there is the most money behind it and making sure that it is implemented and accepted by as many people as possible. Either way it is a better as an investment.
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:33:21
I know that because I made a mistake and someone corrected me. But I didn't carry on that mistake after I was corrected. So I didn't start every comment with a presupposition.
If you think shilling doesn't involve payment you need to go to google and just type in anything you want because you probably don't know what that means either.
I can't be using any kind of rhetoric because I'm not trying to prove anything, I posted because I wanted people to know how much is being invested in bitcoin. And that's there, there's nothing else for me to prove. It's just something to know, like there could be bad things about it, but having millions invested in making it faster is also an awesome thing. I don't really think is smarter, they are wrong about a lot of things, but they also aren't really a cohesive whole either, so they have much more diverse ideas, even if some are wrong.
Also thank you for telling me I talk smooth, another called me a wisecracker and intelligent, it was in a mean comment but I can't really take it as anything other than a compliment.

They do support Segwit2x
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:20:22
1. This is true.
2. Yes, I'm not saying that blockstream is solely responsible for it, only that they have influence and questionable motivation. I am not saying anything is wrong with it either. I am just saying not to use the argument that the original team is better because they are the original.
3. And they would never need to, either.
4. But segwit is irreversible, and the problems that may occur from it are do to outside parties' implementation of it, not from an error in the code. And the blocksize itself was added by satoshi without notifying anyone of the change, not in the way it's done today. Nevertheless, I agree that discussing and testing the code is a good thing.

If I was trying to make money I'd still invest in core as having powerful and rich investors makes it more likely to be widely adopted. And having a company made up of the biggest contributors to the source ensures they won't switch over to another coin, again making bitcoin better as an investment.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:38:55
Segwit2x is a decision, but it's still decided in the same way as any other decision, and it doesn't change who has the decision making power. Right? Even if they came up with it behind closed doors, it's still public what the agreement is, and the code will still be open source. I just don't get what the objection is, it's not like they're actually giving anyone more power. But I really want to understand.

So is it wrong to post to the subreddit with an identical purpose to this one? When I post there some of them say the same thing as you except instead with rbitcoin. Bitcoin exists to stir things up, you shouldn't be bothered by someone seeming to have an unpopular opinion when you support bitcoin. One post about basking in bankers being rustled by bitcoin, the next getting all ruffled by someone who you think supports another coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:50:42
This is true. However, many people on this subreddit refer to Blockstream as the core team, given Blockstream is a large contributor to the open source project both development and funding wise. And that they have people specifically employed to work on the core source code.

One of Blockstream's investors is the chairman of the Bilderberg group and AXA, so I really doubt that there's someone richer than him supporting Bcash. But you are right, my post really does also apply to Bcash. You should also be skeptical of the developers of Bcash and be aware that they have financial interests of their own. I really meant what I said about this not being the time to hard fork, it's just important to know where people's interests lie.

@_date: 2017-11-04 22:46:05
It's not just centralized vs decentralized, there is a ton of middle ground. Extreme centralization leads to special interest control, extreme decentralization leads to a coin that's shitty to use. In between there is a sweet spot. Right now btc is so far from the sweetspot that it's unusable for it's primary purpose, use as a currency, because of how long transactions take. Bitcoin is useless right now because of it's lack of fungibility, and most of its worth is based on people hoping that will improve.. Whatever fork improves fungibility will take over.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:39:49
And what presupposition is that? You are the the one presupposing that I am somehow paid by an open sourced software, that somehow got a hold of my two year old reddit account and had me keep posting my normal posts while I shilled. And presupposing my future actions as well.
Your post namecalls, strawmans, ad hominems, and contains no reasonable content. I can post wherever I want. I am not scared of people who have different opinions to my own. Do you think that the people on will not call me a shill for posting on What do you think a shill actually is?

Telomeres don't make you immortal, and extending them inhibits your body's ability to fight cancer.

So when your cells divide, the telomeres shorten, as you said. But when they get too short, it's not that they start damaging your actual DNA, you cell goes senescent, which means that it stops dividing and starts excreting lots of histones(histones cause inflammation, which is useful sometimes, not so useful others). When this happens everywhere all over your body, it's what causes aging.
The reason this happens, is that as cells divide, all of their DNA is susceptible to damage. The telomeres measure how many times the cell has divided. The "Hayflick Limit" is how many times a cell can divide before it goes senescent. When a cell has divided many times, the accumulated DNA damage is more likely to result in cancer, so the cell goes senescent to avoid becoming cancerous. Additionally, some cells may become essentially cancerous, and divide rapidly, but they will also quickly surpass the hayflick limit, si they go senescent instead of becoming cancerous. So you now see the conflict between telomere length and cancer.
Telomerase is an enzyme that lengthens telomeres. Basically the same as whatever treatments they've come up with. Almost all cancer cells produce telomerase, as it allows them to bypass the Hayflick Limit and divide indefinitely without turning senescent. In a sense, telomere extending does cause immortality; Henriettal Lacks died of cancer sixty five years ago, but her telomerase producing cancer cells are still alive in labs all over the world today.
Some people have diseases that involve shortened telomeres, and these diseases vause people to age very quickly. Progeria is the main example. People with diseases involving shortened telomeres very rarely get cancer, as there is a tighter leash on cell replication, but this is of course at the cost of dying really young from aging quickly.
Also, certain populations with longer than average average lifespans have had their telomeres measured, and they are longer than average telomeres.
So, you are right that there is a connection between telomere length and aging. But the cancer risks off sets this. Living healthily reduces the risk of cancer, so maybe we can lengthen our telomeres a little bit without getting cancer.
I'm glad you enjoy learning about this. I took a summer class on aging at a certain university in high school, which was taught by two doctorates doing research in very related fields, and I learned all about this stuff and more. If you want to know about other strategies to prevent aging, just ask, I would love to talk about stem cells and blood transfusions and more.
