Investments aren't gambles; they're risks.  There's a difference

TIL buying a share of an S&amp;P Index fund is a gamble.

Yes gambles are risks but the reverse isn't true.  You're describing investing as gambling and I'm pointing out there is a difference.  Gamblers frequently do not understand the source or the magnitude of their risk. Investors always do.

This is pointless; I think we're arguing about the difference between the connotation and the annotation of these two words.  Sure, it's a defensible interpretation that gambling is the same thing as investing.  You can find a definition that will support that point of view.
But intuitively, you've got to understand the difference.  At the roulette table (gambling) the chances of one outcome or another are effectively random.  Yes, there's risk -- and because the source of the outcome is random, it's almost impossible to manage that risk.   In the S&amp;P 500, in the short term there might be seemingly random walks, but there are actual fundamentals there, and causality: if the S&amp;P 500 were random, then the chances of it going up or down if there were a terrorist attack tomorrow should be the same as any other day.  But it's not random.
This lack of randomness in an investment allows an investor (not a gambler) to actually know something about the system.  To assess the risk, and to manage it, and sometimes even take direct action to eliminate a risk.   This is 100% different than a roulette wheel.  You can't manage the risk, you can't eliminate it, and you don't necessarily understand the underlying causality of why one outcome or another happened.
So -- the S&amp;P 500 is an investment, and roulette is a gamble.  It's that simple.

Price, and its rate of change, will *always* matter.  If this stuff is supposed to be like cash, usable for transactions, then pretty much nothing but the price matters.

With so much volatility why would anyone buy anything with bitcoin?  The price changes so quickly it would seem the only rational thing to do with it is to get rid of all of it, or just keep acquiring more and not sell.
