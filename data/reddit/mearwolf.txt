Worked for me

So they still stack up better than GPUs for Bitcoin specific mining?
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:17:19
Awesome. Thank for the detailed reply!

This is just like Brexit in the UK: both sides accusing the other of negative campaigning, when both are just as guilty.

And that's more profitable than directly mining bitcoin at the moment?
Are ASICs still profitable for mining Bitcoin. For example if I were to have a 5GH/s ASIC?

is it possible to clone a ledger dongle so I can have a backup in a lockbox
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:00:41
Well I genuinely didn't know it was with an 'e'...

I thought segwit activation was democratised decision so wouldn't they have been within their rights to oppose it?
And what do you mean by bcash attack?
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:37:45
agreed. I even have friends who are Etherium investors
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:47:12


 
Ah I see how I've got the wrong end of the stick, I mine with Slush where the miners themselves chooses how the pool signals.


But attempts to weaken and attack are good, they force the system to strengthen and overcome it. That fact the Cash hasn't been a runaway success is just another feather in Bitcoin's cap.


A fork is a fork, there's no way they could have "taken over". The only way they could have taken over is if people objectively preferred Cash. Which would be a failing of Bitcoin.


I'm unaware of it but I'd be interested to read if you have some links?
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:03:20
�� any more details?
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:04:26
Ah ok I didn't know they used mnemonics 
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:51:01
Why is it FUD?
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:55:49
is there any framework for validating the integrity of a device with Ledger?
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:11:37
eek. what else have they done?
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:57:42
do the mods here agree?
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:49:59
cough cough
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:26:55
Oh sorry, I thought you were referring to coinbase specifically

What are the benefits of Ledger over Trezor?
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:35:41
with currently difficulty levels....
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:18:06
what's up with from Amazon?
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:23:06
gdax perhaps
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:32:20


I thought block signalling was used for the segwit activation? like with [SegWit2x](


I think that's a bit harsh to call then an enemy for having a different opinion


Didn't they just spin-off because they disagreed with the direction Bitcoin was taking? I've never seen any malice from the Cash community

So we'll be able to use bitcoin after the apocalypse?
How will we mine?
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:18:54
physical hack? how so?
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:26:27
If anything, get ready to buy
