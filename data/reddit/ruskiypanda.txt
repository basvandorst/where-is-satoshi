It answers how they can lend out money while still following the "system" of FR. It involves banks accepting deposits (cash, checks, DD) from customers and making loans to borrowers, while holding in reserve a fraction of the bank's deposit liabilities. Deposit liabilities = covers the people who bank with them. If they need their money, the bank needs to have enough to give it to them and not just say "well we loaned some so we don't have it all."
The problem is, back in the day, these reserves actually mattered and meant specific amounts and percentages. Nowadays our money is no longer governed by gold or specific value as its digitally distributed via banks. All your currency is digital. The bank can have 1 BILLION in digital currency loans, that doesn't mean they have the same 1 BILLION in reserves to give back if something were to happen and customers want to withdraw their money.
 (BUT, NOW they can, digitally, because the money doesn't exist.)
Unless I'm understanding this wrong, feel free to correct me.

Exactly LMFAO.
Except we live in a digital age and your liability is all digitized anyway. That's how they do it since they don't actually NEED the legit funds present.

Because nowadays, money is digital. It is not physically held in banks anymore. Most banks don't hold over a mill, if that, and only some major ones do.
"The majority of the **money** in circulation is **digital currency** issued by commercial **banks**,7 as is the vast majority of the **money** issued by central **banks**. Apart from transactions in notes, coins and paper checks, all global payments are now made using **digital currency**."

It does. 
Physical money means they have to give it to you. It’s yours. You can legally take it back as the bank is only “holding” that money for you as they gain “interest” on what the bank loans out. Since money is digitized NOW, banks can approve practically any loan and hand the person that “money” since all it is is a bunch of numbers on a screen. 
If banks had actual cash on file then they technically can’t take your money and run. 
If it’s digital, then your money “never existed” in their eyes if they were to go under. 
That’s the difference.

Uhm, there WAS a point when currency wasn't DIGITAL is what I am telling you.
If the world burns, you have ZERO currency to help you if you use normal banks that won't even have enough money to cash out 10% of their banking customers. Digital currency DOES NOT EXIST. The government can take your shit tomorrow and you can't get it back since it doesn't "technically" exist in the real world.
Interest rate on what?? Savings? Checking accounts don't make no interest. Interest comes from LOANS, not the people depositing their money. The bank makes that interest, not your bank account. However, the **interest** rate paid by the **bank** on money they borrow is less than the rate charged on money they lend.

Confiscating money because it was made illegally, or "blood money" is different. 
Just because you are using Crypto, doesn't make you immune to money laundering. I don;t doubt they are confiscating, but they are only doing what they can to legally obtain them. If they are obtaining them from illegal persons, people doing crimes or using/have used money for crimes or money laundering, bet your sweet ass Uncle Sam is knocking on your door.

I think you do keep your coins. This is why when Silk Road went down, people started frantically selling their bit coins and there were people buying hundreds of them for pennies on he dollar. Those people are now filthy fucking rich.
So since they can be "bought and sold" I'd assume you own them and they can;t be confiscated legally in any way.
