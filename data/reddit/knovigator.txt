Thank you for the feedback. I think there is something to what you are saying... 
I did not mean to imply that everything that does not work out is a scam, but I do think that "scam" is the *lowest* category.
Maybe there are legit projects that are not scams and those should rank higher along the above criteria, but still might not work out.

The end of that quote is:  "...and they are owned and governed by their participants. For many of us, this is the mission behind crypto." Sounds a little like socialism. Having the network participants run the application sounds a little like the workers owning the means of production.

It will be the Bitcoin Standard, not the Gold Standard, because it's harder to seize Bitcoin like Nixon did in the 70s.

My guess BTC is reacting to the Exchange probe news.
