Alot of gift cards.  I primarily use egifter (accepts bitcoin).  I was remodeling the master bath.  Used about $2000 in HD gift cards.  The wife likes Sephora about $300 dollaers there.  I use Playstation Vue show load up with $100 in playstation gift card.  I also load up $200 on an Amazon gift card and park it on Amazon.  I always replace spent btc at the time of purchase.  Nobody is getting my hoard and I perform about 5 to 6 transactions a month usually at roughly 30 statoshi per Byte.  This all works great and who said you can not use it in the real world.  I will prove them wrong.  Egifter has a nice selection of gift cards.  Listen to me it sounds like I work for them (disclaimer I don't just love there service).
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:15:16
Yes, but you will have to get a hold of coinbase/gdax to remove the feature so you can re-establish.  This could take giving up your first born and several hoops to get this done.  Please Please, next time keep your google auth secret seed some where safe.  I think after you after you go through this, you will.

@_date: 2017-12-27 02:05:05
Zippy, Your thought process is spot on.  You keep hold of assets that are going to appreciate.  That is called true savings and investment.  Right now, people will spend dollars on cheap crap because the money is burning a hole in their pocket.  Yes, it will be a painful transition to get to a deflationary economy.  But, it will clean out the true crap products and people will only part with their BTC when the need is out of survival or they feel they have saved enough to by the truly needed new car, house, phone, TV.  Also I bet they take care of their products purchased with BTC better, because the understand the true worth of what they had to pay for them.  Especially when there are only 21ish million of them running around.

I am in total agreement.  I cleaned out my coinbase account today.  They have some things to do before I go back.  From previous post of mine:
1) The accelerated implementation of Segwit on their platform 2) The release of all owed (other coin) to any account that accured them during the hard fork 3) Improvement of platform to always allow BTC and other coin to be bought and sold at any time

I started with monthly buys of $50 back in May of 2013. I am just short of 4 BTC. My moon has always been to be able to sell 3 of the BTC and payoff my house. I would keep the one in my back pocket to stay part of the 21 club. So my number is $70,000, and I will have no debt. Every dime I make will be mine not paying debt. This is financial freedom to me.

so from what I am reading is the dogecoin redditors gave coins to sponsor, but I agree what did they get out of it except giving up some of their coins.  If this increased price then it also worked for individuals that did not donate.  I am not to worried about it.  Everywhere I go the word is spreading fast.  Network effect will take care of it instead of me spending my coins.

watch this sucker back off the 17250 once we get closer.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:32:42
First rule of the road.  Only put in what you are willing to lose.  Evidently you were not willing to lose the $10K ($15K appreciated).  This is why you could not sleep at night.  Next time you want back in just nibble.  Would you miss $50 or $100 out of your paycheck?  If no setup a monthly buy at an exchange.  This is how I have been doing it since 2013 and I sleep very well at night.  Yes, it is a big pile now, but if it goes poof tomorrow.  I look at it like I lost roughly $3K does not hurt me.  I know what my moon is and will pull the trigger when we get there.  I will never have any remorse then either.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:35:39

And that $17,250 or now regarded to as the $17.25 wall is still showing up.  It has been there so long, it definately feels like someone trying to protect a future position they took.  This means if they can keep it up until January maturity it will stay.  They must be in a world of hurt if it goes above.

@_date: 2017-12-16 21:32:12
I would agree.  I would give them a card that would state redeemable for a certain amount of bitcoin (ex 0.001 minus applicable transfer fees) up to a certain date.  Contact me once you have a wallet established to complete the transfer.  That is how I would handle it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:32:38
I respect your point.  I just think that all it takes is one slip up and the anonymity is gone and it does not even have to be your slip up to follow the chain.  Now what did fascinate me when it came out was Zcash.  Now that has some good privacy.  It has been nice talking too you.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:09:29
Yes, if you setup an account at egifter you choose your cards into the cart, then when it comes time to purchase choose bitcoin.  They will give you an address to send to.  make sure you are sending enough transaction fee and the card should be in your egifter wallet within one hour.  You can print the cards or download the egifter mobile app and have them on your phone.

So I run a bitcoin full node (This does not hold my bitcoin stash) but I figured that I would help the network.  Yes, it is costing me some money in electricity, but I like to give back.  I am going to start looking at running a lightning node.  I believe I read that if you facilitate transactions thru your node you get a portion of the fees.  I still have to look into this.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:56:09
I agree with you 100%.  It does take us a little backward having some centralized clearing entities like coinbase for the off chain, but they would only have control of a smal portion of my BTC.  They rest is under my control under my own node.  I can totally live with this.

What you get are all the real extreme followers that believe once blockstream or coinbase or some one gets that much control they become an authority and can start to censor the uses.  I do not see it that bad, because if it happens we just go back to the old on chain and cut them out.  There has to be some give and take at this point to help the transactional process.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:25:41
I have not used purse.io yet.  I normally use egifter to buy Amazon gift cards with BTC, then fill up my account.  Nice thing is egifter give you extra reward points when using BTC.  This is greater than the reward points you normally get, I don't know how it does against the 5% at purse.io.  I am not going to flame you because you are actually using your BTC.  This is how it is suppose to be used.  I do conform to the release and buy mentality.  Spending $200 on gift card, Buy $200 at exchange with in the next 5 minutes.  I am keeping my holdings and helping the environment.  So I get burned by about $10-15 in fees.  Not worried,  I can give a little back for what it has given me so far.  Once lightning goes production watch out.  This is going to be amazing.

sorry, on a serious note.  Cryptocurrencies are seen as assets hence the same thing as a stock or bond.  Any sale of any asset will be taxed for the appreciation.  So it is the same thing as selling some stock to purchase some goods.  Do I agree with this, no, but it is what we have to deal with now.  The best chance was a bill headed thru congress asking that $600 transactions be exempt.  I loved this but got squashed.  I just am staying within the lines now, because there are services that will trace back the chain and find you today or tomorrow to pay the tax man.  Rather do it now then fines and penalties later.  It has been a pleasure talking with you my good man.

It was a free market until Coinbase did this.  That means everybody has the ability to participate in the market to set true price.  When coinbase is holding coins out of the market to not allow all to participate then that is manipulation.  They don't want to release the coins cause they know the other coin will be slaughtered.

I would love to give you a new ISP, but it is not so much the logic that is the problem.  I can build and awesome network (It is my current job).  The problem is the cost of infrastructure.

@_date: 2017-12-16 22:51:25
Well you will have a transaction fee for transferring BTC on the chain.  Make sure the transaction fee is sufficient otherwise you could be waiting a long time for transaction confirmation, but don't get raped on the fee.  Take a look at blockchain.info for what fees look like right now.    .  Once you get your BTC in the account, then if you do want to cash some out you can place an order.  When you setup your account, you will have to provide ID and bank info.  Just keep that in mind.

The deflationary spiral was a cause of the true trigger of the great depression.  The depression was caused by over-extension of credit by banks to all (think of the latest housing crisis), which then were run upon and were not able to cover the saver in their institution.  Once they saw the run in the banks any kind of credit was severely tightened (Again, think of the recent housing crisis.  After the music stopped no one wanted to lend money to anyone.).

@_date: 2017-12-13 05:07:51
So here is how I have done it.  Coinbase $50 per month since May 2013, and I am still doing that today.  Sure it does not get me the same amount as before, but even if you do $50 today you will receive roughly .00294 BTC.  If the price of BTC reaches $100K, then your $50 is worth $294.  It is all a numbers game.  Slowly but surely if you get yourself to just 1 BTC you will be part of the 21 club.  There will only be 21 million BTC ever.  If you can get to that comapny and BTC goes where I think, you will not have to worry.  Yes you are right getting to 1BTC is going to become harder and harder.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:17:22
I do about 4 to 5 bitcoin transactions a month from coinbase to egifter.  One thing I always check if the fees are accounted for.  Anyhow sorry for your bad luck.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:20:53
agree with you totally, but if Coinbase become the most convenient and acceptable channel operator reaching into all the good and service providers.  Then they could exercise control over who is allowed to create channels with them.  It would be easiest to have $1,000 parked at Coinbase and them having all the channels to anyone I want to do business with off-chain.

It all comes down to consensus and features of the coin.  Bitcoin was the first and is the coin that has the largest development effort, with the brightest minds at this time in the crypto space.

so here is the case,  I have a couple bitcoin wallets.  One at Coinbase, where is do some buy of bitcoin.  Now bitcoin knows my bank account and personal info so I can do the buys.  I run a bitcoin client, which has a wallet.  But sometimes I transfer BTC from Coinbase to it.  The I have an Armory wallet that I place some BTC into cold storage.  But that BTC usually comes from my BTC client wallet.  So since it is an open ledger anyone can see that my coin base wallet has some ties to my BTC client wallet that has ties to my Armory wallet.  It is not that hard to do the forensics.  You would be better off just owning up to the taxes to the IRS, because when they come knocking they are going to ask these questions.  If the answers are not up to their standards then you are in for a world of hurt.

OK here are some ideas.
1) I think Coinbase works in Canada.  You could open an account with them and move your BTC to the wallet at Coinbase.  Understand that you will have your BTC at the exchange.  You will not own your key, but you could cash out some on this exchange as well if you want.
2) Get a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet.  This way you are in a safer spot and control your key.  You should be able to move the BTC to the ledger from Mycellium.

I agree and from what I see bitcoin is working on fulfilling all those needs with its development.  The largest and best development of all the crypto out there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:52:51
What are you talking about?  People receive and spend bitcoins based upon goods and services rendered.  Some people hold large sums of BTC because they believe it to be a good store of value but these are their coins.  This does not compare to a third party holding coins, which are owed to others, out of the market to keep an artifically inflated price.  They would have released the other coins already to their proper owners if they truly believed it could sustain it's own market.

This is just a caring mom.  I have one of those too.  She would call me to remind me when we would hit ATH.  She does not really understand it that well, but likes to know I have made a boat load.  Now she is like 'did you sell yet'.  I just tell her this is not end game yet mom and I am still up a lot.  No where near break even.  We would have to hit $1K be close to break even.  Always used money that I could lose so by the 0.0000001% chance this goes bust I could really care less.  Just sitting back with my 3 BTC and letting it ride, I know I am in good company.  Also, my binary event is the lightning network, not growing the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:34:24
Dude development takes some time and you want to do it right.  Bitcoin was good at the beginning and then it grew.  Development is being done to make it better (layer two solutions).  Your answer is throw the baby out with the bath water.  Do you think apple is ready to throw out all the tech on the iphone, no they keep building onto the platform adding features.  That is what bitcoin is doing growing up and thru this growing up process will be better than anything else out there.  I will take the short term pain to have long term success.

been watching for the past 90 minutes the wall at $17.25 ($17,250) got scared off.  Ran to $17.80 and push back occurred.  But the buys are unrelenting and fighting back.  Yes, I like the new bit quotation and am moving to it.
Edit the wall was at 17.25

I agree with you, but there are already services like Chainalysis which the IRS already uses.  People laugh but they are way ahead of the curve on this and anyone that thinks they can evade will be found.  Not today or tomorrow, but it will happen.  The day it does I do not want to be in their shoes.  So I am just honest and upright from the beginning.  If you want to be group in with one of these guys (Criminals, hackers, and drug dealers) just to evade some taxes, then have fun.

Ah god sir, let us view this double taxation from an adjunct angle.  If you were to purchase some juvenile piglets, with the intention of letting them age into prized sows.  Then to use these proceeds to buy thine wife those excellent pearls.  The minute you brought them to market the king's chef would spot your delicacies and take one to feed the king.

Here is what I love about this market.
1) You see the buy pressure continue to build even though that wall is out there
2) There is not way manipulate the market with borrowed shares.  You either own them and want to sell them or you are at the buy end
3) No dark pools to trade behind the scenes.  All is on the open ledger.
This is the way a fair and equitable market should work
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:37:36

I hold 3 and feel like I am set going forward, still doing monthly buys.  After exhaustion, holding 1 will put you in a good spot.  You have to think 4 billion people in developed countries and using 4 people to a household. Every household needs some bitcoin  (21 mil divided by 1 bil) evenly distributed would be 0.021 per household.  Just 1 would make you 50 wealthier than the average.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:43:00
I have accumulated roughly 3 bitcoin through combination of monthly Coinbase purchases over 3 years and some mining (Butterfly Labs devices) from 2014 to 2015 (about 260 Gh), enough about all that. I have begun to look at it this way. Every $168 a single bit coin goes up I am working 9 full time minimum wage jobs. That means that every day I am working my normal job, nine more of me are working a minimum wage job in the ether. How do we get to there? An average full-time job is 8 hours a day @ $7 minimum wage (I did not say I was in Seattle or Washington) that employee makes $56 a day and we are not taking into account taxes and benis. Now if 9 people get $56 a day for their labor that equates to $504. If the price of a single bitcoin go up $168, then 3 bitcoin makes $504. In this case I am working my regular job while 9 more of me are working in the ether for minimum wage. I don’t want to be greedy just $168 appreciation a day will do me fine. Please keep my 9 other employees working.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:14:50

@_date: 2017-08-17 05:27:42
ok, here is some guidance.
1) unless you know what you are doing mining is not the way to go.  You would need to make an outlay of money to get what you need to mine.
2) You are probably looking to dip your toe in the water.  Setup an account on coinbase to do some purchases.
3) Do more reading to understand what you are dealing with and how the whole eco system works.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:36:33
I personally use coinbase for my retail buys buy they do ask for personal info.  Sounds like you might not like that.

what do you mean you can't afford it?  You can go on coinbase and buy a fraction of bitcoin.  You don't have to buy a whole one.  Remember, only invest what you can afford to lose.

Yes, please check the fee schedule.  I believe bank transactions are at 1.5% and credit/debit card transactions are at 3.99% at coinbase.  This could sway your decision.
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:15:31
OK first step the address they gave you is probably the address that was in your wallet and if the BlockExplorer still reflects the amount then you bitcoin is still in that address.
Step two it sounds like they sent you the key, but it says it is encrypted.  Hence you would need to know the secret passphrase to unencrypt.  But, they do state the following:
The password for that file will be publicized if Coinkite shuts down.
Which could be good or bad, but since your bitcoin has not moved from the address probably good.
I run a full node of bitcoin core, which I could possibly guide you through the process, but you would have to be running bitcoin core as well which could take a couple weeks for you to catch up on the blockchain.  Hopefully someone with wallet experience can assist.

The underlying technology will be used to some extent as you are suggesting.  The banks and corporations will start to use Blockchain technology to create their own coins for financial transactions.  But I do not see Bitcoin getting wrestled away from the people.
Probably the biggest impact will be in stock markets.  You will no longer have a central registry of stockholders.  Corporations will begin to start issuing coins that will be held in client accounts safe guarded by exchanges brokerage houses.  You won't be able to get your own keys for these.  But the efficiency gained with trade settlement will be incredible.  Also will cut down on shinanigans at the market like short selling.

This is one of the obstacles of it becoming wide spread.  Anytime you use bitcoin for any kind of payment or conversion.  To fiat, to pay for a services or labor, exchange to another altcoin, this is a taxable event.  You have a cost basis for the original bitcoin investment and has to be accounted for against the services/items you received when you paid it out.  Last year is the first year I included any disposal of btc on my tax forms in the investment gain/loss section.  If you try to leverage it as much as I have to help the eco system, this becomes time consuming to track.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:10:32

@_date: 2017-09-04 23:43:16

I agree with you.  Sent a message to them today.  I was buying an egifter card for Home Depot today and had a transaction fee of 0.00105619 BTC at coinbase that is $4.  I did it cause the points I had at egifter more than covered, but that is way out of wack.  When I just sent some from my bitcoin core client yesterday and specified a fee of 0.00001.  It took about 15 minutes for first confirmation.
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:15:24
Your perspective is wrong if you think that increasing block size is the answer.  Take some time and watch Anton's recent video regarding scalability of block increases.  You will be changing your tune.  He is not one sided either.  Using side chains for micro payments could lead us back to some intermediary payment structure.  Have to find something better, but for now block increase is not the answer.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:49:22
I have seen some on CNBC, but they are starting to shy away from coverage in my opinion.  They run a 4 part segment on the business of marijana and have replayed that several weekends, but they will not do this for bitcoin.  What gives.

@_date: 2017-09-02 14:36:41
That all depends.  I am assuming coinbase restricts you because of country regulation.  So even if you get access via the VPN, how would you fund the account?  They are going to want verification as well on this all could be problems.  Assuming you use a credit card those fees are pretty high.  Would suggest finding an exchange for your locality.  That way you don't have all the red tape.
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:01:32
how were they huge?  Were you holding long enough for long term gains?  If so the you have appreciated wht 400% 500%.  Paying 10% on a long term gain is nothing.  I will happliy pay that when 1 btc is worth $100K.
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:16:02
ehhh, take the dip gift
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:04:46
I would take another look at this, any disposal of an asset (BTC) for anything else is going to trigger a taxable event (Capital Gains or Losses).
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:09:53
the root domain (coinbase.com) is referenced, which they would own that root domain.  Any subdomain (survey.coinbase.com) would only be authorized by the root domain owner.  You can always inquire with coinbase or not answer at all if worried.  Plus phishing is usually asking for personal info.  Since the were only asking for a rating you should be ok.  Now if it would have been survey.coinbased.com, then you can worry.

Mowan, sell what you can chance on going from $$ to zero then plow into bitcoin.  It is always about the risk and reward, but keep in mind that the reward may be $0.  If you can sleep with that then you know where you are at.
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:17:14
I would stay as far away from this as possible.  Keep your own but other could be a problem if something were to happen.  Also, you could be considered a money transmitter service without license.  Let alone you could become entangled in BSA/AML laws.  Believe me you do not want to get caught up in any one of these issues.  Manage your own and teach the rest.
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:00:43
I also think we need to start to transition the quote.  Think of it as a stock split.  You have a stock trading at $100.  Many people are discouraged to purchase because of the price.  The minute it is split as in a 4 for 1 the stock is repriced at $25.  You usually see a bump in the price because those that did not want to buy at $100 see it as a bargin at $25.  Now we would not be doing a stock split, this would just be a recognized denomination quote change.  Believe me we would see a bump in purchases if people were faced with buying 1 mBTC (milliBitcoin) @ $5.70 instead of 1 BTC @ $5,700.  That leads us to when should this change occur.  I would say $10,000 would be the best spot.  Here is what the breakdown would look like.
$10000 = 1.00000000 &lt;- BTC - Bitcoin
$1000 = 0.10000000 &lt;- dBTC - deciBitcoin
$100 = 0.01000000 &lt;- cBTC - centiBitcoin
$10 = 0.00100000 &lt;- mBTC - milliBitcoin
$1 = 0.00010000 &lt;- ?
$0.10 = 0.00001000 &lt;- ?
$0.01 = 0.00000100 &lt;- uBTC - microBitcoin
$0.001 = 0.00000010 &lt;- Finney
$0.0001 = 0.00000001 &lt;- Satoshi
The key here are the uBTC is worth 1 cent and mBTC is worth $10.  Daily quotes shift to reference mBTC at this point.
Just my thoughts.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:08:42
I am thinking about his alot tonight.  Buy some more for the announcement tomorrow.  Would be a huge pop.  I already load my Amazon account with bitcoin through egifter.  This would make it easier.

I always buy and replace.  Mostly use egifter.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:51:45
Don't sweat it.  Think of it this way, only 21 mil bitcoin will ever be available.  That is less than the number of millionaires in the US.  Get a stash of 2 or 3 bitcoin and sit back.  You will be far ahead of all the rest.  Then setup a monthly buy of 100 dollars.  This is what I did since 2014.  Just waiting for the fireworks in the next 2 to 3 years.  Initial purchase of 2 bitcoin would be 12k, no need to go on margin for that.
