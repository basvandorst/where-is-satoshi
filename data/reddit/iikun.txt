The question I replied to was do alts also have the same transaction limits, to which the answer is no. If that question had a proviso that the alt must be useable in as many places as Bitcoin the answer, which any idiot (even yourself) knows, is no. Otherwise it wouldn’t be known as an alt lol.

@_date: 2018-09-09 07:42:51
This is a flawed argument. It is much more practical to allow fiat to inflate than the reverse. Would you rather buy a pen for £1.50 or for  £0.0001? For a start, you avoid having to use a decimal point at the start of 50% of every transaction. 
For purely digital transactions such as with crypto it’s much less of a problem as a decimal point only involves the touch of a button and not a pocket full of coins.

**A basic Summary of the link:**
We can't yet draw any conclusions as to their intentions as this procedure allows them to either try to trade out of trouble, or to dispose of assets in order to pay creditors.  If they attempt to keep trading, typically a supervisor will be appointed to oversee things but I personally suspect the court will appoint a trustee in this case because of the mis-management &amp; that could be the reason behind Mark's title change.




Also, this section should interest most people here:




I hope that people have some way of proving their holdings, or else things might get complicated.
**Full article:**
The procedures under the Civil Rehabilitation Law are applicable to legal entities and private individuals without distinction. While any corporation may file a petition for civil rehabilitation, the procedure is primarily aimed at rehabilitating small and medium-sized companies under a simplified process (compared with the procedures under the Corporate Reorganization Law). However, in practice, even certain large-sized corporations have chosen to file a petition for civil rehabilitation.
Civil rehabilitation is characterized as a debtor-in-possession type of procedure. In most civil rehabilitation cases filed by companies, the current management of the debtor will continue to operate the business as a debtor in possession. However, the court may appoint a trustee if there has been a failure in management or disposition of the debtor, or if the court recognizes that management by a trustee is necessary for the recovery of the debtor's business.
In a typical civil rehabilitation case, the court appoints a supervisor to oversee post-petition management by the debtor in possession, as well as the development and implementation of the rehabilitation plan. This update outlines the main stages of the civil rehabilitation procedure.
A debtor or a creditor may file for civil rehabilitation in a competent district court. A petition may be filed if (i) the debtor is likely to go bankrupt (ie, is unable to pay due debts generally and continuously or becomes insolvent), or (ii) cannot pay due debts without causing major difficulties for the continuation of its operations. However, a creditor may not file for civil rehabilitation if the conditions set forth in the first alternative are not satisfied. If the filing is deemed appropriate, the court issues a decision for commencement of the procedure. In practice (at the Tokyo District Court), the debtor must hold a meeting to explain the details of the situation to the creditors after the filing; the court issues a decision immediately after the meeting.
The Civil Rehabilitation Law provides that a stay of proceedings starts at the commencement of the civil rehabilitation procedure. Before the commencement order, the court - on motion by interested parties or on its own motion for cause - may order a stay of the enforcement, provisional attachment and/or litigation against the debtor. The court - on motion by interested parties or on its own motion - may order a comprehensive stay if the stay of a specific proceeding is considered to be insufficient to achieve the purpose of rehabilitation. In practice, a comprehensive stay order is rarely issued by the court. As a general rule, secured creditors may foreclose on their collateral outside the proceedings under the civil rehabilitation procedure.
Under the civil rehabilitation procedure, the management of the debtor generally remains in place (debtor in possession). The debtor may retain the right to continue its business, unless the court appoints a trustee.
The debtor may also dispose of its assets, among other things, on consent of the court or of the supervisor, except in the case of a sale of inventory or commodities in the ordinary course of business. Further, the law allows the debtor to transfer all or a significant part of its business before the confirmation of the rehabilitation plan.
Business Transfer
Under the civil rehabilitation procedure, two options exist for the transfer of all or a significant part of the business of the debtor: one option is to transfer the business within the performance of the rehabilitation plan, the other is to transfer the business outside the rehabilitation plan with approval of the court. As the value of the business generally decreases rapidly after filing for civil rehabilitation, a debtor often opts for business transfer with court approval in the early stage of the procedure.
The requirements for business transfer under the law are as follows:
Approval of the court - where the debtor wishes to transfer all or a significant part of its business, it must obtain court approval. The court must seek the opinion of known creditors and of the labour union, if a union formed by the majority of employees and other workers of the debtor exists; if such union does not exist, the court must seek the opinion of persons who represent the majority of the employees and other workers of the debtor under rehabilitation. The court may approve the business transfer only if the transfer of all or a significant part of the business is necessary for the rehabilitation of the debtor's business. In practice at the Tokyo District Court, the debtor generally needs to hold a meeting with creditors to explain the details of the business transfer and hear the opinion of creditors before requesting court approval, as the court takes the creditors' opinion into account and the cooperation of the creditors is indispensable for a smooth business transfer.
Approval by resolution of the shareholders' meeting or court approval in lieu thereof - if the debtor is a joint stock corporation, approval by special resolution of the shareholders' meeting is required under the Company Act for the transfer of all or a significant part of the business. However, under the civil rehabilitation procedure, the court may approve the business transfer instead of the shareholders' meeting. The court may approve the transfer only if the transfer of all or a significant part of the business is necessary for the continuation of operations of the debtor's business.
Treatment of secured creditors - assets included in the transferred business are often provided as collateral for secured creditors. As secured creditors may foreclose on their collateral outside the civil rehabilitation procedure, it is necessary to agree with secured creditors on the treatment of the collateral on transferred assets when the debtor transfers its business. The debtor and the secured creditors usually agree that, in exchange for the payment by the debtor of a monetary amount equivalent to the value of the collateral on the assets, the secured creditors will waive their collateral on the assets.
The statutory redemption procedure established by the law allows the debtor to redeem the collateral by paying its fair market value to the secured creditors on approval of the court, where these assets are indispensable for the continuation of the debtor's operations and represent exceptions to foreclosure rights. If the debtor and the secured creditors cannot reach an agreement, the debtor may seek court approval for statutory redemption. As a matter of practice, statutory redemption is rarely used, as the cooperation of secured creditors is essential for the debtor to proceed with the civil rehabilitation procedure and the debtor generally does not wish to go against secured creditors by seeking statutory redemption.
Creditors and Claims
Claims are classified as follows:
claims attributable to common benefits (eg, actual and necessary costs, as well as expenses such as post-commencement wages, salaries and debts incurred in the ordinary course of business);
senior unsecured claims (eg, taxes, wages or salaries incurred before the commencement of the procedure); 
post-commencement claims; and 
unsecured claims.
Unsecured creditors must file proof of claims by a deadline set in the commencement order, which is usually one to two months of the date of the commencement order. Unsecured claims may be subject to a pro rata reduction under the rehabilitation plan, to the extent that the debtor has insufficient funds to satisfy these claims. Generally, claims attributable to common benefits and senior claims are paid in full intermittently outside the rehabilitation plan.
As a general rule, secured creditors may exercise their foreclosure rights on the collateral outside the procedure. Secured claims may be treated as unsecured only to the extent of the undersecured part of the claims.
Rehabilitation Plan
The debtor (or the trustee) must submit a rehabilitation plan to the court within a designated period (typically, three to four months of the commencement order). A creditor may also file a plan within this period.
A civil rehabilitation plan must establish the terms and conditions of the changes affecting all or part of the creditors' rights; these changes must affect creditors equally. In practice, unsecured claims will be reduced on a pro rata basis under the rehabilitation plan. If an obligation exists under the rehabilitation plan or if the obligation deadline is postponed, the deadline shall be within 10 years of the date of confirmation of the civil rehabilitation plan.
The civil rehabilitation plan must be approved by more than half of the attending or voting rehabilitation creditors holding at least half of the total rehabilitation credits. As secured creditors can exercise their rights against the collateral outside the procedure, they are entitled to vote only to the extent of the unsecured part of their claims.
Shareholders of the debtor company cannot vote under the law. It is possible to reduce or cancel shareholders' interests under the provisions of the civil rehabilitation plan if the debtor is insolvent at the time of commencement of the procedure. In practice, shareholders' interests are generally reduced considerably; in many cases shareholders' interests (the capital of a debtor) have been reduced by 100% and new money has been invested.
The civil rehabilitation plan is confirmed two weeks after the court has approved the plan and notified it publicly. The supervisor oversees the debtor for three years to ensure that the plan is implemented. A standard civil rehabilitation procedure at the Tokyo District Court - from the filing of the procedure to the confirmation of the civil rehabilitation plan - lasts six months.
The debtor must implement the rehabilitation plan quickly after the confirmation of the plan by the court. If the debtor fails to meet its payment obligations under the rehabilitation plan, the rehabilitation creditors may carry out compulsory execution. The court may cancel the rehabilitation plan if (i) a petition is filed by either a creditor or creditors holding rights amounting to at least one-tenth of the amount of rights as evaluated under the rehabilitation plan (excluding those that have been performed), and (ii) all or part of the rights in question have not been performed by the deadline for performance of the rehabilitation credits. The court must abandon the rehabilitation procedure when it becomes obvious that the debtor cannot perform the permitted rehabilitation plan. In such case the court may declare the debtor's bankruptcy on its own motion.

Agree with you on the strong vs sound argument. 
Sticking to his guns after two lost decades, coming on three, and now proposing yet another big business stimulus package as he increases the consumption tax rate. What do they say about doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results? Or perhaps that’s his real goal after all...

Kobayashi also said “I plan to consult with the court and determine further sale of BTC and BCC”. 
This could be to cover his own fees and those of various consultants. Also, Japan being Japan, I wouldn’t put it past a judge to fine Mt Gox for causing this whole situation, to the sum of the exact remaining balance. In which case, expect a whole lot more OTC selling.

Given how little it actually takes to move the overall Bitcoin market, don’t forget that investment banks win no matter which way an asset moves. I think we’ve seen that already with futures. There’s more money (for them) to be made in a fluctuating market than a purely upwards moving market.

With each large dip (crash?) I feel the media tries harder and harder to promote bad news and be the one to report bitcoins final demise. Then the market reacts to the “bad news” and they repeat the cycle. 
Thankfully each time bitcoin has overcome but I do feel we’re getting closer to the day it won’t. And the futures market will play a part in that.

Perhaps a bank in a jurisdiction that cares more about privacy than your local bank. Switzerland or some of the Caribbean banks.

Link to news story about hacking robots with ransomware etc.

As did the Saudi economy when the price of oil tanked a couple of years ago (and as it will again when renewables and electric cars take over).

Thx for the info. 
As long as the rate is fair I may also use in the future.

Why would they make a guy who claims he was hacked for several hundred million usd of btc their CTO?! Not very reassuring for their customers.

Yeah, and there are supposedly many of these built by 2025. Most cities can’t even build a small stretch of elevated highway or train line in that time but in the chaos of the future entire citadels are popping up all over the place ��

Oh I see. Sorry to hear that.

We’re getting a tad off topic I guess, but even according to that definition they left out every pacific country except for Australia (the country). 
To be equally pedantic, yes Australia is (technically) a continent but it’s clear from the map it was being referred to as a region.  Or are you claiming Hawaii is a part of Australia? 
New Zealand is also on its own continent (Zelandia) but again that ignores a host of other countries also. 
Take your pick, their map is horrendous.

Jinx confirmed. Bitcoin just ate a $200 dip due to early celebration of its uncorrelated status.

Okay just noticed the map doesn’t add up to 100% so they may well be referring to Australia the country (which is kind of weird in itself). I don’t know what they’re really trying to show but I doubt what they’ve omitted can account for the remaining 6% of whatever it is. 
Regarding the continent issue, as I am from the affected area I can assure you that no one here calls the region Australia, even Australians would call it either Oceania or Australasia.

Are you sure he sold? He could’ve just moved the coins out of your common wallet.

Australia is the country, Oceania is the continent (although some ppl for some bizarre reason also refer to it as Australasia). Either way, Australia = not a continent.

If it gets to 30k I’ll let enough go to get some nice reward for myself

Also doesn’t know Australia is a country and not a continent. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 06:32:51
Australia is a continent but the map appears to be showing areas of the world rather than indicating large land masses. In which case, they should have labeled it Oceania instead. 
You must be really fun at parties ��

If you short at $0 and it goes to -$1 do you win or lose? 
Technically you should make money, but the whole two negatives makes a positive rule...
