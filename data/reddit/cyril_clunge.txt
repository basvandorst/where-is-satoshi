He chose... poorly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:22:50


Of course they will. Shorting isn't some grand scheme. Like every investment decision, it's a risk. But with bitcoin it's a sensible risk given the volatility and how it takes two steps forward, one step back. In this case it's going to be 10 steps forward, 7 steps back.
When people short, they literally look at the data and think "hmm I think this is overvalued and will drop price."
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:19:30
Geez, seriously people. Just buy and don't look at it for a year or two.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:31:20
Yeah everyone think there is some shady manipulation going on. Taking a short position is literally "this is what the data suggests, we think the price will drop."
It isn't "we'll take a short position, let's send an assassin out to start killing the miners and install a virus on the blockchain network."
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:11
I think we're in a bubble because people have seen the price increase over the last year. Hedge funds and investment firms have been getting involved with at least 100 new funds announced, information or launched just this summer. Meanwhile, there hasn't been that much more adoption of btc. It is literally speculation which is driving the price as investors (currently it's just private wealth clients) want in on the profits that btc is going through.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:08:07
May have to increase the price alert to buy into a dip then.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:18:15
Most posts that spread FUD about the futures and shorting don’t understand how shorting works. These investment teams look at the data and think “hmm data suggests the price will fall so let’s take a short position.” Given the volatility and movement of bitcoin, that’s not a stupid stance to take. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:21:54
I work in financial research and have been doing a project tracking crypto hedge funds. Sometimes I’ll pass on the knowledge and thoughts from these managers and people will say not to trust those “experts” because their wrong. Sure, the guy who’s fund is way up doesn’t know what he’s doing compared to the random Redditor who got lucky buying bitcoin a few years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:57:57
Technically nothing is stopping them but you would have to have a huge dump to affect the price that price much that it might not even be worth the short. 
Besides, taking a short position in bitcoin isn't that crazy since it is massively volatile and moves a lot anyway. Plus given that crypto is unregulated but the futures market isn't, that could also be massively illegal but I'm not an expert.
I have a call this afternoon with a crypto hedge fund manager so I can try and ask him what the shorting strategies are. Will try and update if he answers.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:54:45
Only now?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:11:40
Exactly. We have been due for a dip for a while because it is just hype fueling itself. There hasn't been anymore widespread adoption. It survived the forks but for it to be up 1000% in a year is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:11:55
I just got off a phone seminar with some crypto guys who are involved in the hedge fund space and they said the current volatility is due to the uncertainty with the upcoming futures market. They agree that once futures are traded, then it will stabilise which you can expect in February.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:14:44
If people look at the charts and history of bitcoin, they will realise it takes two steps forward one step back. Sure it's down since last week but still up over $4k since last month.
People need patience. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:47:10
This sub isn't entirely helpful and is just memes and spams for bitcoin with the rare good discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:15
I'm getting concerned. A market correction is required as I don't see what is driving this price apart from speculation and people looking to make a quick buck. It's literally self fueling hype at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:02:58
I'm talking about people who are panicking. The price is massively volatile, when it hits an ATH of course it will drop as that is what it does. Two steps forward, one step back.
Bitcoin wasn't able to sustain the growth as it's up over 1400% in one year and there hasn't been widespread adoption and the network is slow. It's literally investors getting in on the hype. I'm just telling people to relax and wait more than a couple of weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:49:26
Futures will give investors exposure to crypto without the risk as they won’t own the actual assets. From a webinar I was on the other day, the panel agreed that the futures should stabilise it. The current price fluctuation is to uncertainty. 
From other managers I’ve spoken to, they already have the ability to short btc. Depends on what their strategy is as they’re either long/short or an arbitrage fund. Can’t say too much more as I don’t know all the specifics but am going to try and speak to more of them to understand their underlying trading strategies. 
At the moment, private wealth clients are investing in crypto hedge funds as they don’t have the same hoops to jump through as other institutions do and most of the performance I’ve seen has been great. Except for one fund which was down a lot but they have taken a short position already with btc. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:14:53
Pretty sure a few of them are already involved.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:22:16
It's nice to be reassured that I have some working knowledge of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:47:06
As a long time hodler, I have no idea what's going on.
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:06:59
And fortunately investors are moving in. ETFs are being opened, more hedge funds are coming to market to get involved with bitcoin and HNWI and family offices are investing with them. Endowments are starting to poke around and it could be a couple of years until bigger institutions like CalPERS get involved.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:13:34
Yeah I agree changes are coming, especially as big banks are starting to get involved. The idea of bitcoin destroying finance and economy as we know is a bit extreme. People thought the sub prime mortgage crisis would do the same but they patched it up.
Sure, big banks might seem evil but everyday people rely on credit and debt. It's a shitty system at times but so far it kind of works.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:29:53
As someone who has been holding since 2012/2013, it's so weird seeing people react like to this when if you just look at the charts, it fluctuates like mad.
I bought some btc for a friend when it peaked at $3,000. It then dropped and I didn't even tell him, just thought to myself "give it a few weeks/months and it will peak at $4,000." The history of bitcoin is two steps forward, one step back.
I'm not even thinking of selling until it's &gt;$10,000. Even then I'll wait to see if it goes to $20,000.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:14:30
I keep mentioning this in a few other posts but I recently just did a project at work to do a market assessment for hedge funds trading with bitcoins/crypto (my job is in HF research for a data provider company).
From fund managers I spoke with, interest has blown up recently and is mainly from HNWI and family offices at the moment. Endowments are starting to look into the space and bigger institutions could be 2-3 years. Currently there are about 20 funds raising and others are coming to market this year which we've seen in some articles. However, those articles aren't great since some aren't run like hedge funds while others are (according to one source) people who don't know what they're doing.
About 80% of funds are just buy and hodl. One guy I spoke with had some interesting strategies going as they're made up of debt, fixed income and then long/short and opportunistic.
The market size is still pretty small (about $500mn AUM) but the returns that I've seen are nuts. So these funds provide investors ways to get into bitcoin when they don't really understand the underlycing tech/maths but just want to get in on the big returns.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:03:59
People just assume it's bitcoin but the value is mainly in the underlying blockchain technology which does have a lot of uses.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:15:44
because at the moment I can't buy a house with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:59:12
Yeah this is really confusing. 
"We want bitcoin to take over and for everyone to be using it! Woah, are these people getting involved with bitcoin!!!!???"
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:21:29
Exactly. I bought initially in 2013 iirc and kind of forgot about it.
Then I bought some more on behalf of a friend when it peaked at below $3k and it dipped down again. Sure it was a loss over maybe 2 months but now all accounts are back up. It's always been "two steps forward, one step back."
Things move quickly with bitcoin but it's still early days. I've never understood people who panic sell unless they need the money, in which case they probably shouldn't be buying in the first place.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:05:14
Some people believe the stock market is over valued. The economy has been really well and some of that is based on Trump who is supposed to deregulate and his infrastructure plan (or rather talk of) has encouraged people. 
Although there hasn't been any legislation so far so....
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:34:55
I was considering getting a gaming PC for about $1k. Since the price of Bitcoin has gone up, I'll end up richer even if I get this PC. Might as well buy some more shit while I'm at it....
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:09:35
Ideally I'm actually waiting until at least $50k.
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:12:05
Well I live in New York City so I think the banks do everything. It would be cool to buy a $10million townhouse with my crypto assets someday but I'll see what happens.
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:08:04


Not yet! Wait until the forks of the future when the split creates houses we can live in, it'll be like Tron!
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:10:41
because at the moment, as things stand I am paid in dollars for everything which is accepted everywhere.
Obviously my plans might change and it depends on what happens. Hence why I'm going to hodl for as long as I can.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:34:43
Forbes have had other articles which were good for bitcoin although they had one about 15 new crypto hedge funds which was... okay. Some of them weren't really hedge funds.
Whoever wrote this article is an idiot anyway because bitcoin has been great for investments and investors are seriously starting to look to get involved.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:02:38
There is interest from HNWIs, I work in hedge fund research and just did a project on the crypto hedge fund space and interest is picking up slowly. It's still a very young market but from the people I've spoken to, they think it will be about 3 years until institutional investors get involved.
Asset/wealth managers are starting to poke around.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:05:20
fuck, should've bought more bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:17:47
part of the point is also to minimise risk while having consistent returns though.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:57:46
yeah but buying them with bitcoin makes it more fun.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:16:27
I've seen a few posts from people looking to get into day trading but they're asking really basic questions and don't know much about trading and bid orders. If you're asking that, day trading probably isn't for you.
Just buy and hodl. You're going up against hedge funds now who are using systematic algorithms to trade and millions in capital who have sources around the world in the crypto and mining communities.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:09:39
Of course not, the whole point of a hedge fund is that it's a pooled fund from accredited investors.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:29:52
The returns we get are monthly, these funds are up as of the end of October through December which is when crypto prices skyrocketed and then dropped again.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:52:01
Even recent returns for some of them (October to December 2017) have been way up.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:38:19
It depends, some of them take a short position on btc (not entirely sure how, this was before the futures options which hasn't impacted it that much). Obviously these funds are massively volatile as they do take a buy and hold strategy but a few of them do trade pretty often, changing their portfolio (depending on liquidity of the coin or token).
So far, these funds are vastly out performing other hedge funds. In recent years, investors haven't been happy with HF performance since as a whole they aren't out performing the general market yet they pay all these fees for being in poorly performing fund. Yet a crypto HF provides some diversity and huge returns over the course of the year. One manager I spoke with said that btc only makes up 4% of his portfolio.
This is not to say that every crypto fund is great. There are ones run by guys like Brian Kelly who have been in the hedge fund/investment management industry for a while and have a good idea. However, I've seen others which are young groups of kids from Silicon Valley who got lucky buying bitcoin years ago and either won't launch a fund or it's just a passive mutual fund.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:11:51
I work in hedge fund research and have been running an ongoing project since last summer to track crypto funds. Having spoken with managers (including this guy) they're all big believers and the returns that I've seen have been nuts.
For those of you saying that it's dumb to put all your money in one thing, they do have a diversified crypto portfolio and a variety of strategies.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:26:05
The point of a cryptocurrency fund is that it gives investors exposure without the risk of owning the crypto digital asset themselves. It's just like any other security or asset really.
Not sure why people are getting so aggro about hedge funds all of a sudden. Sure there's a lot to complain about but this isn't one of them.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:57:46
Please don't freak out if and when the price drops a couple hundred dollars over the next few days.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:49:35
I'm always surprised with people who panic like this, do they never look at the charts? It's always two steps forward, one step back. Just over a week ago we were stable at $4k. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 19:27:18
Hedge funds have started investing in bitcoin, I work in hedge fund research and have seen some with huge returns but they're also massively volatile.
As a whole the hedge fund industry hasn't been performing as well as the public markets but the bitcoin funds have been doing pretty well lately.
I'm not sure exactly how they're trading, some are purchasing btc while others are kind of like VC firms and have invested in companies to help the tech (like Pantera but they also just recently launched an ICO fund). A few firms like Goldman have also said that investors are asking about btc so the appetite is growing. Unfortunately you then have some people like Morgan Stanley who say it should be regulated. Hmm let me guess who they think should be regulating it?
I might actually be starting a special project at work to look into btc based hedge funds so could try and report back some of what I find if anyone is interested.
@_date: 2017-07-08 12:12:51
It'll take a couple of weeks but I'll report back what I find. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:36:06
I bought some for a friend around that price and remained confident it would be fine doing the two steps forward one step back that it's done since the beginning. 
Another told me he sold his amount that he bought with $30 for $80 yesterday because he needed the money and it dipped 10%. If only he'd waited a day. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:37:14
It's not crazy since many believe and speculate that we're no way near the potential peak. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:11:23
How small an amount are we talking about? I only have just over a coin, should I move it to an app on my phone or can I keep it on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:24:28
I've been doing some research at my job into this and talking with a few hedge fund managers who are into bitcoin. 
Some interesting things and people are interested in investing in the space but it's still pretty young. They're getting hungry though. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:52:56
I've bought btc and eth from Coinbase exclusively and kept most of my funds (not a big amount by any means) there but recently moved it.
It really depends on the volume you want to do though, I bought years ago and just held it so it was fine. I was also under the impression that you could still put trades in and it would honour the price at the time, just take a few more days than usual to process?
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:05:33
I'm confused about the drama and concern with price. I keep looking at charts and my numbers thinking "yep, I'm up 200% in total. Oh I'm now down to 190%?" Shrug. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:05:04
Oh cool, the price is down and so is coinbase.
@_date: 2013-08-16 22:07:21


instead of the good old fashioned way?
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:37:46
I think they were saying it caused it. Somehow.
Bitcoin seems pretty gentrification neutral. It was probably their EBT system was temporarily down but everyone wanted to be reactionary and pat themselves on the back. And yes I'm aware I said that in this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:31:34
Similar, I would like to make some money from it but these days I'm probably more left than I was before. My job is in finance which has made me even more disillusioned with the current system.
Yesterday I saw a friend post a photo of a bodega that had a sign saying" EBT not currently accepted" and another sign with a QR code saying "bitcoin accepted!" People were commenting about how gentrification and capitalism sucks and I was thinking "none of these people know how bitcoin works...."
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:16:01
Bought and sold through coinbase no issue. Apart from my own timing. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:30:50
No it's still going to go down pretty low, just wait....
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:06:36
I should have held on....
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:12:31
The price only went back up to $120? If only!
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:05:11
Thanks for this, it sorts out my secret santa gift at work.
