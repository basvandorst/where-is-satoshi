Sure there is. SSL only tells you that their server served it, it tells you nothing about the integrity of the data sitting on the server that it served.

Well if it doesn't, then Alice shouldn't really be signing it, since that's what she's attesting to when signing it, is it not?
EDIT: Thinking about it, 'dumb user signing something they didn't read' is exactly a good analogy for this situation - the web server being the user that signs anything whether it's valid or not, and that being the difference between signed content and SSL in this scenario.
@_date: 2016-08-18 22:19:41
Firstly, because in the second case, if the content is changed, Bob has no way to know if Alice has seen the changes and approves of them or not. If she's periodically signing the content, he can use that signature validation to know that Alice approves of the content. If her machine is just signing anything that's on it, all he knows is that her machine signed it.
Also, it's not a very good analogy to this situation anyway. 'SSL certificate is generated locally and sent to Bob using signed email as before' is not how I receive a certificate when I visit bitcoin.org - I get it in-channel, and can't nessecarily verify that it's their cert anyway.
To put it another way - if I hacked bitcoin.org's webserver, could I put a message there like the one that appeared yesterday? Yes. Could I undetectably replace one of the Bitcoin Core releases with some code of my own? No. So clearly there is a difference.

AOL was also huge here. Well... we had a lot of coasters. I don't know how many people actually used them. In the UK, things like Freeserve were bigger.

To be fair finding a C++ programmer who's a japanophile and cypherpunk is not exactly the hardest thing in the world. It's a bit like saying 'well he was a biker AND he liked rock music AND he had long hair'.

With all due respect, you've not tried, have you? :)
EDIT: I do agree with you though that it's not wanting any trouble, rather than the big evil banking industry squashing Bitcoin - it's just that, their response to 'not wanting any trouble' is always 'say no' - it's not just a Bitcoin thing, it applies to any perceived high risk business.

I was just curious really (also not a real security researcher, I just play one on the internet) - I don't see how the Stuxnet definition is a weakening - seems like the textbook definition to me.
The other one though is pretty dumb. I'd honestly never seen anyone use it in that way, but then I tend to stay away from news coverage of security issues for my own sanity!

Since you mentioned Ubuntu, Canonical has a certification program that lists compatible hardware, though weirdly laptops are listed under desktops (because its the release 'Ubuntu Desktop'):
However, to be honest, unless you're planning to use weird hardware, the situation these days is nowhere near as dire as it was in the past, and especially just for Bitcoin use, you will be basically OK with *anything* - best bet is to either use the certification list above, or just simply pick a laptop you like and google it + ubuntu to see if anyone else has installed it without issues.

Yeah, it's pretty shitty. Netflix use the Silverlight DRM which desktop Linux can't support. There is one workaround, which is a PPA (package made by a user) for Ubuntu that automatically sets up Netflix in Wine for you and makes you a nice icon to open it. It works fine, I used it for a year or so. But I'd prefer proper support too, obviously. :(

I felt the same the first time I tried, but the second time for some reason it stuck, so it's worth another shot. Note that you're going to feel 'unsatisfied' for the first few days/possibly weeks a little anyway, because it's more than the nicotine you're kickin' (cigs have way more than just nicotine) - but after you get through that it's smooth sailing with the vape I found

No. He showed a message that doesn't say he is Craig Wright with a key that isn't the genesis block.

He didn't then, either.

For verifying Satoshi? I can pick a Chromebook up on the way to the hotel.

That what can be done?
@_date: 2016-05-03 03:52:49


It would be trivial to backdoor any software he felt like using - just pick the top 10, it's not like he's going to use some random no-name software to do it.


Why does that matter? He used a laptop controlled by Wright.


He would have then found a reason to abort before it came to that point and retry later in more favourable conditions. That's what charlatans (and magicians) do.

They had no downloads of the signature, not the application. It could be that he just didn't bother checking the integrity of the download.

I don't know about that - otherwise seemingly reasonable people often do strange things when confronted with obvious proof that they fell for something stupid. Look at people who believe in quackery, etc. Gavin doesn't seem to me to be acting much different from people who fall for Nigerian scammers and then keep sending them money.
@_date: 2016-05-02 11:51:23
There was never any proof that was Satoshi in the Dorian instance (it was most likely not).
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:22:16
And why do you assume he has done that?

I don't care who he is, I care who he isn't

Besides which, even if they didn't block 25, nobody is going to accept mail on it from consumer ISP ranges anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:10:27
Port 587 doesn't require SSL. If your ISP's does, that's just their own doing. 465 is the usually used (but unofficial) port for SSL'd SMTP, 587 is just like 25 - it starts cleartext but can use STARTTLS like 25 can to upgrade to SSL.

This is kind of ignoring the fact that the vast majority of people on Android don't use an up to date version of the OS, though. So chances are, their phone is riddled with potential methods to 'access portions of memory from other apps'.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:05:42
Everyone has their own deal. GMail will accept you straight away if your content and IP are clean. Yahoo like to see certain features enabled (DKIM, FBL's etc.) but are mostly pretty accepting. Hotmail is the only major one that I see doing what you describe (spamboxing 'new senders').
The fact that we are having this discussion though, is why people leave running mailservers to someone else. :P

Yeah pretty much. Paypal and CC are reversible and Bitcoin isn't, so there's no real way to prevent fraud here. Paypal also don't like "virtual" currencies much.
