I should have mentioned these were WHOLE COMPANIES. Not just two personal computers.
Entire companies data backups every day? Phew

mint idea is pretty good.
advertisers and others would pay good money for this info and you wouldn't have to give up your anonymity. SCORE.

My thoughts exactly. Smells like a whole new security industry could be born.

thats generally a given...
but are you referring to decryption programs specifically to combat the problem?

You know you don't have to do this manually. You can build a node.js bot to go through a massive list and ping as many as you want.

I would have to interject, that unless it's just a cash/credit or btc transfer, almost all monetary interactions are bound with some kind of if then clause. Taxes yep. Any sort of hard property (credit checking, refinnacing, etc), B2B contracts, it's everywhere all the time, it's just not in the consumer world. I think that's where ethereum will shine. Maybe consumer class in the long run.
Re: Simplicity. I am in charge of that. The BlockApps team is building a whole bunch of stuff to make this all easier. We are doing test runs at hackathons. My team won the first :)
Re: R&amp;D Ethereum v1, is very bare bones and the team acknowledges that. It is "zero to one" inventive in the Turing complete caregory, no more no less. They are thinking about v2 already. And what it will take to scale. The parameters to do so are much more complicated that BTC so we will see.

if what were to happen? I'm confused.

The platform they are talking about will not be powered by bitcoin despite what the title suggests. See the Guardian article on it here where they mention Ethereum many times.

 I'm betting this is one of the people in 21 Inc.

This! It could actually go to zero and it provides the same utility as a telephone landline but for transfer of value.

The TradeBlock team actually made a huge collective effort to move completely off of Twitter Bootstrap (if that is what you are suggesting), both for the homepage and the app. We are continually evolving our interface and hope to make to site as stunning and usable as possible.
