When BTC is tanking this is usually what happens. At least that’s the correlation I have been seeing for the last 2,5 years...
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:14:21
How is this even possible?
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:36:28
Cool like a Don Corleone for simpletons...
@_date: 2019-07-12 09:18:57
Hahaha, exactly
@_date: 2019-07-15 11:16:39
Smart kid
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:25:42
Yes, there are more examples of this. Lier in chief

Well, I said it basically since day 1 of this despicable human being in office and it annoyed me really bad when all the right wing trolls or just some naive people aired their excitement that Trump was supposedly going to be all for Bitcoin because he is supposedly such a free market guy and such an opponent of the FED and whatever - what a bunch of horseshit. This moron is going to be the most ardent opponent of Bitcoin imaginable and he is going to do the FED’s bidding here all along

I love how rightwing leaning crypto fans, trolls or naive people were all excited that Trump is supposedly a free market guy, an opponent of central banks, etc. and he was supposedly was going to be a Bitcoin enthusiast. Yeah right, how stupid one has to be to make such statements...
He is a corrupt moron doing big business’ bidding. That was obvious from day one. On top of that he is probably stuck in the 80s and afraid of any change.
Solution: Winklevosses or whoever have to give him couple thousand Bitcoins - oh he will love crypto then...
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:37:50
Or maybe they know that sth bad will happen to Bitcoin soon? I’m a noob, so I undestand very little of what is going on with crypto, so excuse me please if my question is dumb...
Also, their dominance or near dominance in BTC mining and their dealings with Goldman Sachs (Wall Street) are worrying...
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:34:17
Everyone is laughing and all, but what about such scenario: some government or central bank or a combination of both gains control of Bitmain (their financial situation, if true, will invite such outcome) and proceeds to fuck up Bitcoin network employing 51% attack (I know: effects of the attack would be shortlived, but the impact for the reputation of Bitcoin - huge). Possible? Probable?
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:44:21
With Rubel going down they better start buying BTC or whatever except erdogan coin
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:36:11
I know I know:) I just emphasised the control factor... and I don’t differentiate between Western or Asian banks
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:42:16
What? What he said was spot on. And it is especially ironic that putin and his clique who embezzle billions of USD each year accuse anyone of money laundering.
The title of the post is very true. If Navalny and his associates used Bitcoin, putin wouldn’t be able to do anything (well except imprisoning them but he does that anyway).

Facts are not the same as talking points. The Czar killed a lot of people already. He sticks his dirty fingers in too many pies.

This nicely sums up who really owns customer’s money when it comes to just about any currency except BTC

First of all, I was pointing out an obvious lie on part of CCN - that they supposedly are an unbiased news source.
And second, do you have any proof that Google censored CCN? Maybe you also think that Twitter cracking down on Russian bots and trolls (they certainly do try to control what you think) is censoring those poor honest Putin bots?
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:27:07
Part of their “statement”: “While CCN is unbiased as a news site – meaning no political agenda from the editorial board – we have allowed all sorts of opinions from journalists and guest writers. From the far left to the far right. Many of our political Op-Eds have been “Pro-Trump.” Remember: We are mainly a crypto centered news site. Cryptocurrencies started with Bitcoin in 2009 as a counteraction against the financial meltdown and the cartel-like power possessed by banks and The FED (which is privately owned). Bitcoin is, or at least was supposed to be, DECENTRALIZED. We are true to the crypto community with our slogan: We Are Anti-Elite, We Are Anti-Centralization.”
What a bunch of horse shit. They were pumping protrump propaganda like 90% of the time and now they call themselves unbiased... 
Anti-Elite? Anti-Centralization? Give me a break

Good luck with the salw
@_date: 2019-02-03 12:46:48
What a bunch of horseshit
Whatever is the bias of silicone valley tech people it has nothing to do with what happens on Twitter, Facebook, etc. - after all it’s not like they post political twits and FB messages themselves (and that would be meaningless anyway).
In the meantime GOP dark money, corporate dark money, Putin’s dark money use FB, Twitter to a much higher extent than any left-wing propaganda would ever dream of. One of the messages they pump in idiots heads is that there is left-wing bias on Twitter and idiots ofcourse believe this.
@_date: 2019-02-09 12:14:41
Lenin also said something like that. Well, that’s obvious now anyway
@_date: 2019-02-03 22:42:50
Are you seriously using „lying Ted” as a way to proove validity of your point?:)
So... a corporate hack gives some anecdotal evidence and what else? Maybe some statistics? Something more scientific?
Well, here, have some. Just a 1 minute search and I see sources which seem much more trustworthy than Cruz (well, that’s a low low bar I admit):
Some anecdotal evidence:
So, in my opinion it is like this: whatever bias of people at Twitter or Facebook, Instagram, etc. has nothing or almost nothing to do with what happens at those platforms. Rightwing propaganda made the most use of those platforms so far and „cries wolf” now - in order to either dupe idiots into believing that nobody brainwashed their little brains (and they are exceptionally smart and good) or in order to take those platforms under control (which would be really ominous).
Moreover, the case of CA seems very shady - hard to imagine that FB didn’t know how the „stolen” data would be used.

Oh, Mr Bitcoin is fucked - he didn’t respond to Israel!

Again, anecdotal „evidence”. Besides, PragerU is doing just fine with their propaganda - the outreach is huge (although many of those or probably bots haha) - just like any other right wing propaganda not only on YT, FB, Twitter, etc.
Also, if PragerU will win - we will have YT (and other platforms will follow) under state control - that’s a really great idea, right? Again, another evidence of conservatives love for the big state. They are „libertarian” only when welfare and healthcare is concerned...

Apples and oranges.
Neither the car nor the tank didn’t take power and control from the hands of the powerful/oligarchs/corporations or whatever you might call them.
However, if BTC mining and „services” (insurance, credit, something we haven’t thought of yet, etc.) will be geared to serve the interests of the oligarchy than maybe we will have a boom.
Still, the problem of not being able to print money out of thin air will remain - and that’s the best business of all...
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:59:04
Yes, sell now so I can buy more at better price
@_date: 2019-02-09 09:21:13
I didn’t say nor imply such thing. Obviously
@_date: 2019-02-02 18:25:35
What a bunch of horseshit. Such a liberal „bias” that right wing trolls from GOP, Russia, Cambridge Analytica, etc. made super successful propaganda on Twitter.
@_date: 2019-04-07 19:45:21
100% accurate, a damn prophet
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:40:59
Considering the stakes this number seems pretty low. For Wall Street, Central Banks, etc. - this is peanuts. If the calculation is correct than maybe Central Bankers are not „out to get” Bitcoin after all?
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:01:25
I don’t like them and don’t agree with them most of the time (central banks, IMF, etc) but listening to what they have to say is a rather different thing. The stable boy from your analogy has enormous resources and can employ the brightest minds (and lots of them) to achieve whatever he deems necessary

Is Circle basically Goldman Sachs?

I’m gonna be going there once in a while nonetheless:)
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:52:45
Oh please, like they driven the market since Jan 2018? Or like they driven the market for gold, silver, palladium, etc. before? Give a break
I wish Wallstreet and the rest of those fucks just stayed away. Ain’t gonna happen though...

Went to Hana. Paid with BTC but the whole „affair” was a drag - they went looking for a „terminal”, their qr code was shit
