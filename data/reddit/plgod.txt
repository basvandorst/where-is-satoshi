Centralizing Bitcoin! Why did no one think of that?
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:38:00
This is completely absurd. Upvoted.

I too am looking for free money. Must be quadruple digits only, don't waste my time sending me hundreds.

Man I loved Bitcoin Cash when it had a chance of taking off. I blame this douchebag for BCH’s current reputation...

You're confusing 2 kinds of attack. The one you describe is the majority attack. Double spends don't require the majority of processing power to execute.
The former "cancels" transactions after they were confirmed, the latter "cancels" them before the first confirmation.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:40:37
That was the point of the original question. The answer was that yes, the merchant is taking a risk by trusting, not unlike the risk that a CC transaction will be charged back. My reply to that was that CC chargebacks are traceable, while one could get away with double spends.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:35:47
This has been the case for centuries until we invented credit cards. If you wanted your money back, you had to sue. That's how money works, you can't just take it back.
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:12:43
In such cases though, most of the time it's the credit company that ends up paying, not the merchant.
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:26:22
Interesting! It means forfeiting anonymity and you must always use the same wallet, but yeah, it'd probably work! I'm sure it would be needed though: if people can scam the stores some definitely will...
@_date: 2018-06-08 10:45:53
How do they do that, when the customer pays cash/Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:59:58
A major difference IMO is that you can't go around doing chargebacks on all your purchases. If a purchase was legit, you'll eventually be forced to pay one way or another.
If I go to a store and pay with Bitcoin, the merchant has no way to find me if I double spend after leaving the store. If I have a reliable way to do double spends, I could go around buying everything while paying nothing but tx fees.
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:17:00
Not only that, but they'll probably want to check your ID too to verify you're giving valid information. At this point it'll just be too much of a hassle and people will prefer to pay credit. This brings us back to the original point: either the customer has to wait for the tx to confirm, or you have to jump through several hoops to prevent scams. Either way, this makes Bitcoin (in its current state) not super convenient as a method of payment.
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:19:24
Yeah, but that's voluntary and optional. Obviously if I'm trying to scam I'm not going to register for anything.

What’s your node going to do if all the miners keep making blocks with a block reward? Reject their blocks? Ok, then what? They’ll have their working blockchain and you’ll sit there with your chain that doesn’t move because, well, you can’t mine blocks. Yes, nodes make rules, but it’s the miners that choose the rule set.

Not the whole time, but it’s hard to use computers once you turn into an owl.

Not too well, actually. Dreamt of weird stuff and woke up 3 times in total. The lightning and hailing outside probably didn't help.

The whole point of cryptocurrencies is to let algorithms decide, not humans or their banks or their courts or their governments. I like Bitcoin Cash and its ideas, but what he said is true. Bitcoin was never supposed to fork, the system is *designed* to eliminate forks by a proof-of-work contest. And BTC won that contest. Maintaining an alternative chain is fine, the system is open-source, but it's just that: a man-made alternative. New cryptocurrencies are created every day, BCH is just a reasonably popular one.

1e80 is around 2^270, which is a number that can be stored in just over 8 bytes. Not quite a planet's worth of data...
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:17:07
If you’ve heard anything of the BTC/BCH feud, the blocks being full (and do we need to do something about it) was kind of a hot topic. Today, every transaction is competing with many others for a place in the next block. Nothing prevents you from using transactions to send messages, but for each message you’ll need to pay a transaction fee big enough to convince miners to put it in a block.
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:47:50
It is. Wow, time for me to go to bed.
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:41:31
Sell. That way I can buy it from you while it's low and sell it back to you once it starts rising again :)
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:44:39
I agree with the trust part, but I'm not sure about network security... AFAIK, a non-mining node can reject blocks but a thousand nodes rejecting blocks won't do any good if they can't mine blocks of their own. Even in the case of a fork, I'm not sure a non-mining node has any kind of weight. Might help with network reliability, but is that really an issue?
Do correct me if I'm wrong though!
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:38:25
I knew that people on r/Bitcoin didn't like BCH, but damn, are you guys really going to forgo a whole shop, one pioneering LN adoption by being one of the first shops to accept payment through LN, with a front page proudly advertising LN and everything, just because it sells BCH merch somewhere not even on the front page?
That is pretty hardcore, man.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:41:59
Did what? Shrink the mempool to a slightly less abhorrent size?
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:03:23
Bear with me here, I'm genuinely trying to learn. But let's say people disagree on a change such that nodes prefer one set of rules and miners prefer the other. Obviously, mined blocks won't make it to the network since all nodes the blocks will be sent to will reject the blocks. But then when a node wants to make a transaction, miners will not put it into their block because it won't fit their rules. In that case "both" networks will stall.
So don't they both depend on each other?
The reason I thought miners had more weight is because the way i understand it, in the above scenario, all it takes is a single miner to agree with the nodes' network for it to start working again (completely centralized, yes, but still working), while a single node in the miner's network won't have anyone to transact with...
I just recently learned about the BTC/BCH feud, so I'm trying to understand how it really works...
@_date: 2018-07-05 19:00:27
Are you saying that sometimes hard forks are the right way to fix issues in a system?
(Sorry this one was just too easy)
@_date: 2018-07-01 12:21:47
Very high tx fees don't really help raise the median, that's precisely why we use the median instead of mean.
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:47:54
You don't think the Lightning Network is something that risks being centralized? Or do you consider LN a temporary solution?
Sending blocks over TOR is something I hadn't thought of, and is actually a great argument.
However, I can't see how SPVs could clog the network more than transferring whole blocks. SPV transactions are still placed in a block once the SPV processes it. Therefore, each block included all SPV transactions *and* the non-SPV ones. They can't possibly be smaller than sending individual transactions...
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:17:22
I'll admit that I don't agree with calling it simply Bitcoin when for everyone, Bitcoin refers to BTC, and, well, I'm not a huge fan of Ver either, but Kraft Foods' smaller company in the split was called Kraft Foods Group, why do people find it wrong for Bitcoin's smaller coin to be called Bitcoin Cash? Do you find it confusing?

"It never really hits a scale ceiling"
"By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions."
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:53:54
Hmm, you're right. I guess in the long run, there is a risk it would become difficult for smaller mining pools to operate, especially considering diminishing block rewards...
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:46:24
It started out as simply an alternative to r/Bitcoin because some users found that the moderation here was too strict. It was always meant to discuss Bitcoin. The argument was made that BCH was the real Bitcoin, and that discussion was not tolerated here, so r/btc became the de facto place to discuss it. Nowadays you can't really discuss anything else over there. You won't get banned, but you'll be severely downvoted if you don't think BCH is the real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:29:05
I see it as two children of the same coin, which is why they have so much in common, but you seem to see it like BCH is a copy of BTC. Why is that?
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:00:14
Well as I say in the post, I don't want to start preaching BCH here. But to make it kinda short, for now BCH just works: low fees, instantaneous transactions (merchants don't have to wait for confirmations since all tx's will be included in the next block, thanks to non-full blocks). I don't see major problems with big blocks because a typical user doesn't need to run a full node. It is slightly less convenient, maybe, but IMO much better than LN, which has all the predispositions to end up with a few big hubs ("banks") centrally managing all transactions, and is unnecessarily complicated.
You're right about ASICBoost, though. I'm not an expert but it does seem problematic. But it sounds like something we can/should do something about (make the technology available to everyone or whatever) rather than give up the entire system because of it. You don't see people throwing away computers because a security flaw was found in Intel's processors...
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:03:43
Oh, ok. Thanks anyway! Have a good day, y'all!
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:49:46
Your argument assumes BCH is a knock-off of the real thing. What convinced you of that?
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:46:14
Mining power? I don't think so. Most people are pool mining already, in both cases. Full nodes, maybe, because big blocks are harder to store, but not mining power.
@_date: 2018-04-28 03:29:20
I didn't know about that, and that's the kind of arguments I was looking for :) It doesn't quite change my mind, but it's a valid point!
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:26:07
I agree so much with that. One thing these two subs have in common is the daily throwing of crap at one another. I wish there was an option to filter out all these posts and keep only the useful discussion (also pictures of merchants accepting crypto and that sort of thing, I enjoy seeing those too).
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:06:15
You're right. That would make it the "main" coin. But companies also split up, and both entities can coexist, can't they?
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:10:50
Now I’m tempted to put it up right away...
