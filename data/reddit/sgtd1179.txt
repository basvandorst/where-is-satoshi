By obvious, do you mean your constant rhetoric to support your short position? Pretty hypocritical to talk about tether/market manipulation when you are in here attempting to do the same. Save your breath.

Not if they don't  want to scare all the peasants.  They like to leave a little ray of hope.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:15:46
I agree, I'm thinking 6800~ range but the looks of it.
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:43:24
For talking crypto?
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:49:13
They'll be back...and in greater numbers.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:39:55
No, I get the term. What does that have anything to do with what I said?

@_date: 2018-05-28 04:10:31
Anyone with a little bit of foresight can see the real world potential of Bitcoin/blockchain. In hindsight I wish I would have pulled the trigger earlier.

Keep shorting homie.
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:45:16
Typical response with no dog in the fight.
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:47:45
It amazes me how shortsighted some people can be. I swear if ADHD was a disease, it would be epidemic in this thread.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:21:52
"Investigation" The SEC on WS is just there to make retail feel like there's some kind of policing force. When in all acctuallity the don't do squat. Same thing with this so called investigation, just a show. $ talks everyone else is a observer.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:34:09
Who is talking about Lambos? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:06:03
Yeah, still this foreplay BS is annoying.
@_date: 2018-05-31 16:20:51
Thank you redditor for a day. Always a red flag to me when someone creates an account and their first posts are aimed to spread fear. Just a "coincidence" it so happens to be on a pos day. No bias intentions here. /s
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:26:15
Pretty sad, I bet you couldn't wait for it to drop slightly so you could say I told you so. Grow up.
@_date: 2018-05-31 16:38:36
I think I made myself pretty clear. The fact that you immediately retort with insults solidifies my point. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:21:53
No one is buying your drivel, go fly a kite Gilbert.
@_date: 2018-05-23 01:08:52
I'm scared...hold me.
@_date: 2018-05-31 05:29:42
Bitcoin price should be the same across the board, there should be no difference based on platform/exchange. I highly believe they are doing other activities as well...i.e suspending withdrawals/deposits prior to runs/drops ex: BCN. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:27:08
Yeah, I was going to give everyone last Saturdays winning Powerball numbers, but I forgot.
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:08:17
Thank you my brudda. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 19:33:03

Yeah, just like I don't go to work to make money. /s
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:25:03
Not everyone can own a full bitcoin, get them while they last. ��
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:47:01
Yeah, feel the same. Higher lows each time.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:50:30
No, they pull stops to a certain depth, then they slowly buy over a period of time without bouncing the price too high. Wash, rinse, repeat.
@_date: 2018-05-26 07:27:58
Buy buy shorts, cover quick.

Just because you don't understand something doesn't make you dumb, we all start somewhere. Now, premding like you understand when you dont...thats dumb.
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:14:37
Just my observation, but it seems like someone  (insert group, whale, institutions) is keeping it at these levels to accumulate. I could be wrong, but it sure looks that way.
@_date: 2018-05-31 20:27:42
@_date: 2018-05-31 23:44:43
I don't respond to all your posts...
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:45:56
Oh FFS, can we pick a direction already.
@_date: 2018-05-31 19:41:44
In other words it a bullish signal.
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:05:54
Ahh, gotcha.

Last time we had an upward cross was the beginning of Apr. That was the run up to upper 9k.

Stop throwing out FUD without facts. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 05:43:39
Yes, I know. Definately a large gap on certain exchanges.
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:51:53
Ya know what? I AIN'T FUCKING LEAVING!!
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:55:27
Maybe we are starting to see the decoupling of bitcoin-alts.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:13:16
I actually thought it was funny.
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:02:06
Always...always preface all questions with "it's pretty dumb".
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:14:53
You probably right. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 07:12:00
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:22:29
Haha...this is why I love reddit.
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:49:31
Each drop has created higher lows. This is highly unlikely.
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:17:40
Name checks out.
@_date: 2018-06-04 04:50:21
This is why blockchain is important.
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:23:29
Translation...they entered last month.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:13:38
I think its about time other crypto currencies break away from Bitcoin. Yes, it's the Genesis, but there are far better alternatives that are superior, IMO.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:35:33
Due to an unforeseen slowdown in the speed of our data sync, we now estimate for all trading activity to resume at 2018/02/09 4AM (UTC). In the 30 minutes prior to the commencement of trading, users will be able to use utilize all other account related functions. -Twitter
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:48:46
TA can't predict binary events, so its good to a certain extent. I wouldn't bet the farm on TA tho...been burned trading stocks and options that way.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:22:09
The struggle is REAL!

I find the most erotic part of a woman to be the boobies.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:57:46
Calling what?
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:59:12
MA, RSI, VWAP mostly.

"machines would replace much of the house work"
Nope still need women to activate those vacuum cleaners and food making devices.
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:16:29
So how about this flat earth, you think bitcoin is involved?
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:39:59
Apparently the longer you've been on Reddit, the smarter you are...yeah sounds legit.
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:51:11
Wishful thinking, should have bot when it touched last week, big money did.
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:41:35
Lol, lemme guess... bought high, got burned, current status...salty.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:15:45
People selling...
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:49:35
My TA of the last month or so. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:45:25
Interesting...go on
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:06:42
Actually, it was probably the lazy ones who invented the wheel.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:51:40
To me this looks like some consolidation, before a pop. How long this lasts is anyone's guess, but personally I think its going to be a slow climb.
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:56:44
Ha ha...you right
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:41:17
Technical Indicators such as RSI, MA, etc are just tools that contribute to a Technical Analysis (TA). What TA are you talking about? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:49:49
Seems to be the pattern.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:45:30
Even the 4hr doesn't look that bad.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:57:28
This is how they get your coin, they scare the weak and buy up cheap. Most who sell will end up buying higher. Institutional buyers do it all the time on Wall St, now they are here. GL everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:27:09
Yeah, I wouldn't get investment advice on Reddit or any social media platform.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:28:18
...and here we go.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:45:32

Sorry, those waiting for sub 10k are out of luck, those days are gone.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:46:07
Nope it means buy more TRON lol.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:39:00
Well now...that escalated rather quickly.
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:10:37
Oh God really? That's what they missed, women outside the home...FFS 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:14:13
You should probably stick to $1 scratch off tickets.
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:58:12
"I have read SOMEWHERE", Yup, sounds like solid info...double down!
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:01:22
RSI on the hour still showing it could drop below 8500.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:42:33
Fair enough, you just seem to have a severe pessimistic attitude and poo poo face with your posts is all.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:51:06
oh he's trying.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:09:31
Enough with the Elliot wave rubbish.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:46:01
Those are both Technical Indicators.
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:37:56
I let you know when I have some gains lol.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:36:52
Here come the "Bitcoin is Dead" fluff pieces and usual rubbish.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:57:32
Alts looking good about now.
