They imo fairly pointed out that btc is innovating much slower than others. Not saying this is good or bad. Seeing the current environment as a feature is sad though
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:25:47
Ethereum currently has substancially lower fees and wait times. Eth performs near twice as many transactions per day than btc. 
What do you mean by user base?
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:30:12
Ethereum has 3 times more nodes than bitcoin. Setting one up is probably tricky atm but very doable. Why do you think bitcoin is more decentralized than ethereum?
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:05:46
People will still need on chain transactions...... making the on chain transactions cheaper and faster will make the LN even faster and cheaper

I wont be using Neo, just an example. Im mostly in on Ethereum which has raiden too. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:30:39
Aside from the immutable comment, everything you stated is wrong.....

Gaming on the blockchain is just the begining. Prediction markets and gold will be on the blockchain in a few months. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:49:20
Stability is a need on the blockchain and a more fungible form of gold has obvious benefits.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:22:12
Not trolling. Take Neo's version of Trinity for example

You sound knowledgeable
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:40:23
Ya, ive heard a number of people mention it like yourself. Im sure it will be fixed soon if its still an issue
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:14:46
Shitcoins will also have their own version of lighting and will be an order of magnitude faster and cheaper than lightning
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:22:34
The rating company nailed this issue on the head. Ethereum prioritized scaling as the number one objective and is activly developing many solutions, both on and off chain. 
Bitcoin, to my knowledge, is banking on the lightening network. IMO bitcoin has demonstrated a lack of ability to innovate and doesnt seem to recognize it has serious scaling issues. No on chain soluyions that ive seen.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:57:07
I was being generous with that comment. Btc is just as vulnerable as eth in terms of immutability. Its a community decision. I actually have heard that immutability in eth will be stronger than btc when it moves to POS
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:11:11
I agree but have an important thought. Ethereum for example, isnt doing things differently in a way, its doing more. 
It can do what bitcoin does (faster and cheaper too) AND can facilitate smart contract giving it utility. 
This additional utility, in my eyes, makes ethereum a better store of value.

Starbucks refers to it as digital assets, notjust Bitcoin. BCH will probably be included honestly

The average person will be unwilling to use a currency that could have lost 15% of its value over night. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:53:26
I mean mainstream adoption. North of $1 Trillion market cap.
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:52:15
What amount of volatility (in percent) do you think the general public will accept.
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:51:46
I think you're missing the point. People living paycheck to paycheck can't afford to lose 15% over night. Therefore will not adopt bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:27:38
What fixes are current and waiting to be activated?
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:41:32
I'm talking about people using it as a currency. Not just investors. It's a big transition.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:55:06
What does "the backbone of financial transactions mean"?  
Why can't it be cost effective?
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:33:55
I think it's clear who the emotional one is...... I'm just asking reasonable questions. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:18:23
The whole point of bitcoin and what makes it a store of value is the potential for it to be a currency. However there is no solution of how to resolve this critical issue.... 
You see what I'm looking for?
@_date: 2019-03-18 22:23:01
Not funding so don't spank me but I have a skeptisims about L2 maybe you can help me work through. 
Wouldn't moving the large majority of transactions to lightening negatively impact miner rewards and therefore btc security?
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:38:49
Relax man, I'm not demanding anything. I just asked a question you don't know how to answer. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:58:34
I'm trying to make a case for bitcoin as a currency. You are only thinking about it in terms of an investment.
Do you not think it will succeed as a currency?
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:01:31
Lol relax. I'm thinking long term and seeing if there is a road map of how btc plans to address future challenges. 
Volatility is a big obstacle that will likely need a solution for main stream adoption.
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:55:49
^that is a wierd comment to down vote...
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:23:43
Tha kds for the response. That was a great explanation

Gold is great. Not sure why we need to be fighting it
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:18:44
You dont think there are some circumstances where centralized control structures can be more efficient?
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:43:38
They removed it due to a lack of development, not adoption. Long term thinking.

@_date: 2017-08-31 16:31:45
Im partial to the property rights arguement, i just feel like that argueme t needs to be drilled down a lot more than it currently is. You use a fairly easy example but if you want to address your point more convincingly, you need to address the harder property rights issues. Also addressing the economic incentive/game theory problens associated with that.
If i buy a skateboard for example and sombody takes it because i cant own property, that is not a society i think would be high functioning.  
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:16:12
How do you determine a 'fair' price as mentioned above. Is market value not fair? Who decides what is fair? Is it fair for sombody working their ass off and providing massive value to get the same resources as sombody who is a beach bum? 
A quick unintuitive example of this is pice gouging for water in emergency situations. Economically speaking, this high market price has a good outcome. If there is profit to be made, more people will bring water to people in need and the high price will prrvent people from buying more than they need (which they would). Any history book will illustrate the failures of centrally controlled models to even provide food in good conditions.
 We are in an imperfect world and capitalism makes life more comfortable and opens new possibilities.
I think the society you are thinking about would fail. However, i would love to see a society attempt is and see how it goes. 
 
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:27:11
It would be far less costly. Roads get paid for through various fines, fees, gas tax, fed tax, etc. Its hard to measure exactly how much but its ridiculous. 
20% of wa state transportation budget goes toward ferries, transporting the rich to their island houses smh. 
If you only paid for what you used, it would save most people a lot of money. A small number of people would be paying more because the use more. That and Gov bureaucracy is expensive.
@_date: 2019-06-01 00:14:45
Ya, just saying crypto has enough scammers that we cant really point fingers gets at the gold market
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:51:13
They have partial control. Like most things in America, blending capitalism and socialism results in crony capitalism
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:22:55
I get how it could be good in some scenarios. I just see how much more efficient and productive we would be without it. 
Having an idea really isnt worth much. It's in the production, marketing, etc. Ideas are a dine a dozen. I see so many patent trolls and blokes thinking an idea is worth billions.

You understand the cable fiasco is a result of government monopoly right? People cant add new wires to the grid...
@_date: 2019-06-12 23:05:29
I agree, That's why I said relatively. Its undeniably better than bsv and tron
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:10:39
Absolutely. More so at the state/local level.
@_date: 2019-06-01 05:10:04
Imagine testing your gold before purchasing it
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:22:44
Does it matter what i want? Why wouldn't it work?
What if another blockchain is more secure, cheaper, faster and annonymous?
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:52:07
Without government enforcing intellectual property, the prices would not be high. You shouldn't be able to own an idea.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:08:38
Other than a military and justice system, I dont see much else that's necessary. Roads and the sort can easily be carried out by the private sector.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:37:05
Orange county didnt really privatize roads. They did a half privatized, half socialized setup which always ends in crony capitalism. 
Sharing risk and reward between the public and private sectors is extremely complex and almost always doomed to fail.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:55:29
Cool your jets bud. Bitcoin was first to market and got that household name branding. Not sure what you mean by distribution
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:19:47
Better tech will always come out. A better blockchain or somthing better than a blockchain. This notion that one blockchain will win and be king forever is silly.
People do not want to be traders and worry their currency value is on the fritz. 
His solution is gold backed crypto that would create stability and minimize risk. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:38:51
Bitcoin only has value due to scarcity. Not sure what arguement youre making
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:33:11
New roads arent really built anymore, just widened and maintained. I see what you're saying but it's less problematic than youd think. 
Electricity and water management are horribly run. That analogy is painful to hear
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:24:56

For now i suppose. Btc is regularly losing market dominance
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:40:47
This reasoning is why i have little hope for btc
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:06:30
Hey, I feel where you're coming from but think it's a bit anecdotal.
The costs would greatly be reduced as a whole. If you pay for what you use, some will pay more and some will pay less. It's like any service. 
When we talk about issues like ferries or busses being less available, it's more of an argument to welfare than about efficiency.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:44:35
You have a dozen different point and I cant address all of them. What county are you taling about?
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:20:18

@_date: 2019-06-12 22:48:54
Tron and bsv are far worse. Bch just gets the most shit because its relatativly a more viable threat. 
Litecoin is the btc whipping boy and is seemingly cherished here
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:35:27
Why so hostile? They base it off how much money is put into currencies. 
@_date: 2019-04-27 04:24:49
I like your spirit but you didnt make an argument. If I buy stocks on etrade, are they mine? Has this been a successful design historically?
If grandma want to invest, you think she should buy hard wallet, setup and store private key in a seperate location, keep hard wallet software up to date, and jump in and out whenever she needs to trade?
Trusted institutions are a good option for some. In my example above, etrade would be safer than grandma managing btc.
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:30:40
It would have been best to use ether &gt; bat
@_date: 2019-04-27 03:30:04
Not everyone wants to manage private keys. This is a good option for some
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:56:09
Physical gold is a terrible currency
@_date: 2019-04-27 20:45:08
You dont see any value in allowing people to speculate on btc on major platforms like etrade? you would say the same about gold ETFs?
@_date: 2019-04-27 18:31:19
Your not making arguments. You're just stating a random facts and regurgitating dogmatic sayings
@_date: 2019-04-27 22:25:52
Not all gold investors want to buy a safe and take on the burden of securing it. An option (with different risks) is nice to have
@_date: 2019-04-27 14:51:30
Im still not seeing what your argument is. Just using BTC as a speculative asset is the biggest use case in crypto right now. 
People with ledgers arent going to switch to ETrade.... this is a platform the will offer services to the old and lazy, which is a giant market. Growing the market is good.
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:33:44
Well, not quite anymore. Digix (DGX) is a tokenized gold backed token. Its insured and redeemable so gold is back in play now.
I generally agree that what you are proposing is a better method to hold btc. I just dont see this as harmful and one more step toward adoption.
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:34:33
If i linked you to a milton friedman book, would that be sufficient to makr my case? 
You dont have an answer on how to calculate price. And its laughable to think any substancial amount of money will be raised without force. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:25:36
In order to provide those services, you need taxation. Taxation requires force. 
Do you agree?
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:38:14
1) I didnt follow your first responce. In your ideal model, how is a 'fair' price determined?
You say that a person shouldnt have to pay for medical care. That sounds nice but what is the means to that end? You would effectivly be forcing doctors to work without pay. That sounds like slavery.... 
I have subscribed to models similar to yours, such as the venus project before. Its a beautiful idea. However, what i dont like is that it imposes its beliefs on others. In a capitalist society, you can have communist/socialist regions within it. In a communist/socialist society, you cannot have capitalism cannot be pursued freely. 
You see how one is clearly more authoritarian than the other?
 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:26:26
Alright, what do you consider "doing well"? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:49:26
My brain must be too restricted to agree with you. �� 
There can be an economy without money, it would just be really difficult to navigate 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:39:40
So in your ideal society, i should be able to do nothing but lounge, play and eat. All while others are forced to give me healthcare, food, shelter, and other resources?  
Whats next? Is gravity oppressing you? 
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:05:55
Probably for clarity
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:16:41
The way you see capitalism, imo, seems bitter and bias. You dont have to screw people over to get ahead, especially your grandmother. Hard work and persistence will suffice.

They dont seem to be interested in tokenized (backed) gold either. I think it really is just tech that makes them leary
@_date: 2019-05-03 04:52:15
Part of it is centralized which is the downside. There are benefits over crypto though.
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:11:53
Lmao your saying gold market is easy to get scammed in? Compared to crypto??
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:19:53
Why not a middle ground? Tokenized gold could be a perfect balance. It's provides many benefits of the blockchain and of gold.
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:08:50
All bitcoin has an expiration, the first time a hacker figures out how to crash the network. In all honesty, the asteroid is probably less likely.
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:14:23
Tokenized gold (dgx) only charges .06%.
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:10:13
We have had tokenized gold for over a year. Digix (dgx) is independently audited, insured, and redeemable. This eliminates almost all the issues on the list.
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:02:22
Most gold is jewelry so is not paper but i see your point
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:55:31
Imagine buying 3 BTC, holding it. And finding out it's been hacked/stolen. 
Imagine buying BTC and years later realizing its actually a different token called BTC
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:11:33
We have tokenized gold already. It would be interesting to create a list of btc vs dgx.....
