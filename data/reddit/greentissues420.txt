Post a LN wallet and you might get some donations 
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:05:20
The problems with escrow and smart contracts will always be subjectivity. Who decides the product was defective, or if the buyer doesn't deserve a refund? That's too nuanced to just code, but that need gives PayPal most of their power.
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:41:17
FUD isn't arguments lol. 
I'm already transacting on LN, no friction and Im only online during broadcasting/signing.
@_date: 2018-05-31 23:01:36
I'd trust it faster if it has lots of well known and trusted people working on it, and a bigger community support behind it.
With this wallet, once you have a channel open, can you receive more lightning coin without rebroadcasting on chain? Might look into using it as a lightning hot wallet over eclair if so.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:45:42
This is one merchant with $8,000 in actual peer to peer payments in a couple weeks. That one merchant has done more peer to peer cash in this time on LN than all other coins combined! And that's not including their much heavier on-chain usage.
@_date: 2018-05-27 03:42:37
You are wrong, no forks resulted in failed 2x.
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:26:54
Who is Anton kudaigordoski? How was he single handedly able to release an app superior to eclairs before anyone else and why is there no other information?
This looks like a scam wallet that steals keys... 
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:31:24
They aren't because of 2x like you said... You are wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:55:56
LN will solve those problems very soon. Sounds like you're butthurt that it's making your alt coin obsolete?
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:48:18
The website is barebones. It has source code but I'm not a programmer so I don't know if the source code is secure, or even if the posted source code is what's in the play store... That's why I'm asking for verification instead of trusting it lol
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:17:28
This is the big thing I'm hoping for. As long as the coin has the same security and properties, who even cares if you never leave LN?
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:36:34
The real complexity issue is lack of easy mobile wallets. The only good one now is eclairs, but it's deposit/spend only. Once they update it to receive lightning coins, everything will be way easier.
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:37:43
Yes eclair lightning wallet works great as a normal wallet too. 1 cent fees for normal txs!
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:40:52
Were you familiar with this project before today? I'm concerned it's a seed stealer... Not from a major company and no info about project or dev iutside his tiny website...
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:23:13
It would take 1024 tries for each position, or 24000 tries to try each one. You d need to try at least 4 non-consecutive words to be semi-secure
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:08:05
I'm not a cryptography expert but I think remember people saying ecdsa doesn't need changing until it's compromised, maybe by quantum computing or such. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:41:26
The cool thing is, even with needed improvements now it's better than any other coin.
Ln can do more than bch at Max capacity, not even counting how all but Jihan's bcash nodes would fizzle out at that point.
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:44:21
Today's spam was only a half a Bitcoin in fees lol, it was nothing.
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:27:20
How does your node know to reject invalid blocks? And what happens if some miners collude with a bad block that the independent nodes know is fake?
@_date: 2018-06-21 02:24:36
Running a node can earn you fees for routing other people's payments
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:34:49
The 50 tokens you onboard for 1000 SATs ($.08) at channel creation.
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:39:49
Did you try that between two of your own wallets? How did you do it? Did you need to breach using a complex desktop wallet, or could you do it all from app?
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:49:26
Please don't spread misinformation.
LN transacting does not require your own node. I don't have one and I get along just fine.
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:37:16
Exchanges move around millions of dollars per tx, and charge their customers through the nose for it.
What's a $20 fee for a $10,000,000 transfer that also earns $10,000 in exchange fees?
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:00:30
Thats the stupidity called "modern status quo" and it had a lot of inertia.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:49:10
I think it's good to have merchant solutions for merchants that want Bitcoin... And also merchants that want to accept it for fiat. No harm in both solutions existion as world slowly transitions off fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:51:46
I've actually tried opening a channel to bitrefills nodes and they never work because they have too many connections already. Only way to get to them is via LN routing!
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:58:32
2 months ago, the 1% success bar was like $80. It's constantly rising and growing as a network.
@_date: 2018-06-04 03:20:27
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:49:39
Credit cards charge 2.5% fees to the merchant. Cash is dangerous and labor consuming to physically handle for the business owner. 
Bitcoin has neither of these problems.
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:30:58
If you want trustless, buy from decentralized exchanges like bisq, or buy from another peer.
Are you trolling? How else do you get coins lol
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:12:15
Science disagrees with you.
Equality is a social construct.
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:38:29
Yeah it's not easy having a decentralized currency. But that doesn't mean we should give up and let Jihan run our money for us.
@_date: 2018-06-05 19:38:16
That's the dream
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:37:36
Doesn't look like it... I made a new one and sent it $20 for minimum loading fee lol
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:32:45
Both of those systems could be built into Bitcoin instead of fiat. But Bitcoin gives you the freedom to choose not to be required to options into a system that has 3% fees.
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:53:34
Do you mean two different 24-word sets can point to the same private key?
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:05:26
Yes I knew the gist but how does a node know the block is invalid? Does it trace every transaction to its addresses previous blockchain states?
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:08:49
Btcduke, vaultoro, bitbargain
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:49:40
Again, you're talking like it's not even out. It's been public facing for two months and is already more used than any alt. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:54:32
And they're both worth about the same here -  nothing lol
@_date: 2018-06-04 03:23:03
You don't need to boycott spending bcash because no one actually spends bcash anyways lol
@_date: 2018-06-22 00:18:49
An spv isn't "running a node", you're conflating terms to make it sound bad. They also aren't counted as nodes on the network, because there are tens of thousands of wallets and only 2500 nodes.
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:04:06
Your post is nonsense 5 different ways lol
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:22:51
Don't listen to him nano doesn't actually work lol
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:37:00
I don't know, but it is still limited by the onboarding. I loaded 250k SATs, and it won't let me start receiving until I drop below 240k SATs. And that might be the biggest my channel can get.
Much better than nothing, but I'm looking forward to channels not limited by the on-chain onboarding.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:01:09
This is awesome!
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:19:18
Oh snap u/roasbeef responded to me! Ok now I believe it's legit lol. Testing it now.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:05:02
That's pretty cool the Olympus server works like that.
Can you go into detail about backing up and rebroadcasting old state from mobile app? You did it all using the wallet app, right? Mine always forces updates when the seed is loaded...
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:22:24
Vert is poop
@_date: 2018-06-05 19:19:09
Did the transaction closing get included in a block yet? You have a hash for that?
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:05:18
There are like 3 exchanges already
Bitcoin is in beta too version 0.16 lol
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:44:59
I love seeing mempool like this. Next block is still only 2 SATs/b (3 cents for segwit) even though there's huge demand for blockspace now.
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:37:09
Pow isn't a problem, but pos actually is
Tx costs are a necessity to avoid spam, centralization, and censorship
No dapp works better decentralized than on AWS...
Masternodes are centralization
Privacy is already being solved with Bullet proofs.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:59:05
Why are you bitching about that after it's already out lol
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:45:04
On-chain to LN doesn't require trust... What are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:19:59
There's an artist who sold canned poop for thousands. Maybe you should get in on that next lol

You guys rock, keep it up.

@_date: 2018-06-05 20:01:53
Why not?
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:51:22
I guess you don't have business experience. Taking cash, you have to pay someone (your own cashier up to an armored car) to take big bills and bring you change. You also have to account for errors and theft on the part of your employees.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:01:34
Yeah hoping too. Also the seed is native segwit bc1 addresses (bip84?) So it doesn't play well with other mobile wallets or eclair lightning wallet. I got it backed up on electrum, so there's that.
@_date: 2018-06-01 01:34:03
Thanks this is the info I was looking for. Googling his name as spelled in the app (woth one small typo lol) came up empty so I was hesitant.
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:24:10
You clarified it wrongly again lol
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:03:23
Again... None of those are solutions, they are problems in themselves.
Work is necessary and decentralized. Who cares about some electricity being used? No one cares about all the people being paid to produce, transport, and secure USD.
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:09:13
To piggyback on u/waxwing Bitcoin lightning wallet does allow receiving and I endorse it's functionality. Super functional, but ugly UI
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:55:40
Lol you're silly
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:49:48
Also if you want to add funds back to a LN channel you can receive lightning coins directly. There are xchanges selling that now.
@_date: 2018-06-04 03:25:41
Vouch for this, currently using it with great success sending and receiving!
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:59:37
But you are wrong. LN cannels cam be topped up without you doing another on chain tx for it.
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:48:23
I've been using my eclair wallet as a normal wallet also... So I'm not sure what you're doing wrong.
Are you sure you're scanning/typing the correct public key address for exchange deposits? And are you sure you don't have the Bitcoin in a lightning channel?
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:20:39
There are merchants that accept Bitcoin. Have you tried spending it ever?
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:23:27
Stop spreading misinformation.
You don't need a LN node or a Bitcoin node. A wallet is not a node.
I have a mobile LN wallet that is not a node. You are wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:48:42
I've been buying and withdrawing without issue for a couple months now. Check your addresses and make sure you don't have malware injecting different ones!
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:06:59
Functionality wise (even LN receiving aside) it's definitely ahead of eclair, especially with the Olympus server watchtower/routing. Needs a better gui tho lol
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:59:56
Ok so... What happens when everyone just starts uploading avengers infinity war for a 5 cent stream charge?

@_date: 2018-06-20 20:24:54
As eth and others are finding out, there's no problem that a clunky, slow, expensive blockchain can do better than a AWS server other than decentralized currency. 
Plus complicated smart contracts are super hard to do without problems (DAO, parity...)
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:50:36
Bitcoin is about securing the base layer. You can always build trusted institutions on top. Like coinbase and traditional banks.
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:44:35
Can you honestly give me a specific example of a existing or theoretical dapp that needs to be censorship resistant, which can be accomplished with a dapp?
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:52:03
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:26:43
First I consider that a feature not a bug...
Second, alternate coins with no security spending and economically invested protectors are more vulnerable to attack
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:42:10
Another day, another lightning wallet. I'm still experiencing with Anton's, but this looks cool too.
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:38:28

@_date: 2018-07-11 10:50:06
Electrum Android has bip70 but I can't load a segwit wallet in it, only legacy 12 word seed wallets
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:55:56
I don't know if you can tell how much btc is "transacted" because of routing. Each tx is 10 nodes each doing their own tx. Routing also makes privacy much stronger by default.
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:42:51

@_date: 2018-07-23 10:38:10
If I read this correctly, this bip is to introduce partially signed signature transactions, which could be used to break up multi-input txs for ease of signing by multiple users?
I'm only familiar with major multi input txs needed for dust collection from a single user at once, what's the use case for this?
Edit - also the link says it's aimed to work offline... But how does that work? Especially if you can restore our offline bip174 wallet into an online regular wallet elsewhere before the offline tx is synced to the chain?
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:47:56
It's not just a qr code, they only support certain Bitcoin wallets and versions. Even if you can scan qr codes, you can't pay with segwit.

AMP and channel factories will make it ready for the big leagues I think, and those are maybe 6 months out.
@_date: 2018-07-08 12:52:12
No... It doesn't tell you anything about volume.
If a channel started with 0 on one end and 1 on the other, and switched to 1-0, it'd look the same
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:47:11
Side question on invoices, are they time-restricted? I don't see a lot of public posted addresses, only generated-on-demand

Really appreciating your website, but yes it's getting complicated with all the stores. The satoshi voting is a good step up. Do you have a donation site? I don't see it on the donation list.
Also any way of finding out merchants signed up with processing servers?
