Bits for me? How generous of you!

I disagree. We don't want to make bitcoin a elitist currency. The more people that use it the more valuable the currency becomes. I'm all for bitpay, it simplifies the buying process and allows the merchant quick access to fiat currency without any hassles. I believe the 1% fee to be more than fair enough considering the fees you incur in every other transaction method available.

Was that order with btc? I just find it comical to think how this opens up trade a lot more without having to worry about exchange rates, whether or not the CC companies will allow it,  etc.

IMO that's poor accounting practice. Look at it this way, you have 1000 rubles in your bank account and your tracking you books using US dollars. Doesn't make sense right? You need to track savings in whatever currency your storing. Track btc in btc, USD in USD. 
What your tracking is exchange rate and that has a minor impact on the books only if your delayed exchanging it into whatever currency is your end means.

Ooo.. My first tip. Thank you kind stranger. 
Don't you need to put my username in though? (I'm clueless how the tipping bot works) 
Edit: got it! Guess I was wrong

Yeah...waiting in anticipation to buy...bought some a bit early at 310 but it'll come back up.

No. You're correct but your initial analogy was not the same as this. 
The volatility of the ruble will effect the value of the entire company in USD as the ruble company keeps it's accounts in rubles. 
However, your initial example was essentially similar to this:
Both companies keep accounts in rubles but I'm checking the value of the company in USD. Of course the value of the company will fluctuate day to day in USD because of this. 
It doesn't make sense to hold something in one currency but value it in another if you're not using said stored currency. If your holding 10 USD then your holding 10 USD,  not 0.05 btc. Your buying power doesn't change if you store that 10 USD (aside from inflation) because the USD is stable (more or less). However, because btc is raising in price your buying power to purchase btc is reducing. If you want to value something in btc then just buy it in btc. You don't go around valuing 10 USD in yen or rubles so why value the 10 USD in btc? 
Edit: the only time a currency comparison like this is necessary is when your looking to buy something in currency A but the price is in currency B. Sorta like spending USD to buy something Mexico even though the price on the sticker is in... whatever currency Mexico uses.

The point of bitcoin is to use it as a form of currency. I can care less if it drops a bit on Friday. I want to see record btc sales on Friday so that other retailers see this and adopt bitcoin as well. 
Please keep in mind that bitcoin wasn't created to be an investment but a currency. The purpose of currency isn't to stockpile it but to exchange it for goods. 
The more people that adopt it,  accept it, and use it, the more valuable it becomes to everyone.
