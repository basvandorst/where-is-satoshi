Yeah, but since XTers are so convinced ∞ block size is essential to Bitcoin's success, they should just make that into a working sidechain and prove its market viability first, before dragging the entire ecosystem down with their half-baked Starbucks jihad.
Sidechains don't "solve" scalability, but they do have the effect of isolating XTers to their own sidechain which they can proceed to bloat to their ever loving heart's content.
Just as an additional bit of irony in the history of Bitcoin, I'm 100% sure Mike Hearn was one of the earliest voices vehemently against Counterparty "bloating" the mainchain. I hope the irony is not lost on him.
When the XT chain bloats irreversibly after a year or more of 1GB blocks, they can just launch another Jihad to reboot it under some fresh sidechain. No harm, no foul.

This entire subreddit was up in arms about sidechains just a few weeks ago. What happened?! You're acting like Blockstream is **literally Satan**. How could anyone read your post and still take stock in the latest fad opinions of the hour?
Let's get something straight, friend. When Blockstream saves you from Ethereum, they're the good guys who have Bitcoin's best interests in mind. But GOD HELP them if they say something about Bitcoin that you think is wrong. Then they're LITERALLY SATAN. The mental gymnastics here are just *incredible*.
And you *do* realize that if the entire world adopted Bitcoin tomorrow, the vast majority of humanity would be forced onto Coinbase even with *5GB blocks*? Today's hardware and internet can't even deal with 5GB blocks, even if you desperately had to!
Does Bitcoin *permanently* fail in your opinion if the entire world adopts it tomorrow? Because we're all going to be on Coinbase then.
So is that a failure in your opinion, chief?
Because since it clearly wouldn't be a failure, by process of elimination that would be a SUCCESS. In fact, Bitcoin would succeed in that case beyond anyone's wildest imagination, the majority of the planet being trapped on Coinbase for a decade or more notwithstanding.

According to the [Open Bitcoin Privacy project]( which objectively measures wallet privacy based on [documented metrics]( the best Bitcoin wallets for privacy are full nodes. There isn't any reason to believe SPV clients can ever offer the same degree of privacy and autonomy as a full node, since full nodes just don't make outgoing network connections telegraphing your IP and related address balances. Hence, sacrificing Bitcoin's ease of running full nodes on a home desktop could conceivably be doing Bitcoin considerable harm in the future.
Is that motivation enough for you?


Funny. Because the argument that it *wouldn't* result in destruction of all but a handful full nodes for the entire world running in datacenters is based on *extrapolation of Moore's Law*. We can surely agree humans suck at predicting the future?

Ironically, a "wallet developer" claims in your linked post that Bitcoin miners should be paid for by either raising the 21,000,000 BTC supply cap, or paying surety bonds to them, which is inherently non-anonymous and fully centralized. That's called XTCoin - and if that's what Bitcoin is allowed to become, you're going to lose ALL of the core developers who will simply never support that abominable trainwreck of a cryptocurrency.
Yes, there *are* downsides to a block size of ∞. The primary one being you can't afford Bitcoin's security anymore, which not only necessitates either surety bonds or raising the supply cap, but which also leaves open the ability for Bitcoin to be bested by a more secure ledger with rivalous hashing power. Litecoin would be freaking DUMB not to market themselves as being the true, lighter weight global currency that is actually accessible on a home desktop full node for superior security and privacy. THAT's what I signed up for. I didn't sign up for you to bemoan first world problems such as how many pennies it costs you to buy your freaking coffee.
Everyone wants the block size to increase, dude. You're not special. You just fail to understand that throwing as much data as possible at the CORE UNIT of the system is rather ill-advised, to put it mildly. Raising the load on the core unit is a LAST RESORT scaling option, not the FIRST. Just like Bitcoin is a payment network LAST, and a store of value FIRST, as evidenced by 80%+ of all BTC never moving from cold storage! You think you understand what real users of Bitcoin want? Phooey!

Their proposal IS inaction. That people think it'll be the doom of Bitcoin when transaction fees are rising is the only reason public opinion is entering this debate. People have been saying increase the blocksize for years. Why all of the sudden is it being debated in the open? If not for a PR campaign, this matter would not be a pressing problem in the public eye.
Nor was it a pressing matter for any of Bitcoin's developers. You know - the same developers who BUILT the system? That's why 80% of core developers were caught flat footed in face of this PR blitz.

BIP101 is the least bad path forward. But there's a problem with it:
How can you guarantee that if BIP101 passes, in 20 years, BIP1001 with 100X the block limits won't also be passed under similar auspices?
That XTers all want NO blocksize limits is **very clear**. If you could get what you wanted most, that would be it. You want no block size limits, ever. So why should anyone in the opposite camp trust you with BIP101?! This is literally why governments don't negotiate with extortionists or terrorists. We know you just want more of what you're getting, so why even give it to you at all?
Ironically, this is the same exact reason why XTers decry "inaction" of core developers as giving cause to XT. After all, if the core devs don't want block size increases *today*, what guarantee do you have that they'll be supportive of a block size increase in 5 or 10 years?
Neither XTers nor core developres have been able to make contractual, written agreements holding themselves to a particular policy.
Finally, to attempt a hostile takeover of ANY open source codebase, in this case Bitcoin Core, in the marketplace against the express wishes of the maintainers of that parent project is at minimum a party foul, and could even be construed as being hostile to IP rights depending on the open source license used. I don't care how much you hate Blockstream, the XTer's ethics are just an abomination. They're clearly the "Bull in a China shop" outfit here.
