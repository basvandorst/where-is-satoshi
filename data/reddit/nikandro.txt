How many of these do you think are new users vs existing users from other exchanges? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:48:28
Right, one is a billion dollar, venture capital funded, legally operated and insured exchange that has operated without incidence. The other is Mt Gox. Pretty much the same thing though, right?

Did he specifically say "private"? So he wasn't speaking about Bitcoin or Ethereum?
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:20:41
Yes, it's unstable. But, that's expected. Bitcoin has a current volume that is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of any fiat currency. Small volume means it's more reactive to market changes. This activity was very common in the 1700's when different states generated their own currencies. Kind of like, a drop of water in a puddle vs a drop of water in the ocean. 
You're missing the point though. You're commenting on it like it's an attempt to replace cash or gold, which it isn't.
It's hard to say if Bitcoin will have staying power, but the paradigm it has created is here to stay (as long as the internet exists). It's already taken seriously by a lot of people, so we don't need to wait for that.
Don't look at it as a currency, look at it as a new technology and payment paradigm. There is no intrinsic value to an email, yet the technology has changed our lives, because it allows a new and faster medium to transfer information.

Neither PayPal nor Coinbase are technically considered banks. They don't engage in fractional reserve banking, don't accept deposits as defined by federal law, and both state regulators and the FDIC have stated they are not banks.

I can't answer that accurately. I assume it's dependent on your carrier and the plan you have. Do you have a text message plan with your phone? I believe there are instances of "premium text message services," so there's a chance you could be billed. Next time try with an internet number like Google voice.

Maybe, "too set in his ways" is a better description than "outdated". Buffett, and most other financiers similar to him, are all looking at Bitcoin from their island of cash and gold. It's difficult to understand and value Bitcoin from that perspective. It's similar to when the media covered major internet developments in the early 1990's. They couldn't understand how something so intangible and  "virtual" could have so much worth, because it was very foreign to them. This is similar to Buffett, IMHO.
With that said, there have been many other very successful companies that Buffett has passed on simple because, "he didn't understand how to value them".

There's a chance you'll be signed up for premium texting, which means you'll be charged even if you have unlimited texting. You can contact your carrier however, and request they block all premium texts (ATT, Verizon, TMobile, they all offer it). Be cautious when responding to unwanted texts that solicit stuff, since sending a reply is sometimes considered, "an act of signing up". I believe that AT&amp;T, Sprint, and T-Mobile discontinued charging their costumers for premium texts last year, but I'd confirm this.

Times aren't like they used to be. There are many legit exchanges now, that follow strict rules, hold most assets in cold storage, are FDIC insured, and have all digital assets insured. OP is just basing this post off of experiences with more shady exchanges.

Except I'm not wrong. At no point did I say "Bitcoin is FDIC insured". All USD on Coinbase is FDIC insured. Digital assets are insured by a third party. This information is explicitly written on the Coinbase website.

Well, several billionaires did the same thing, that’s my point. This includes the Walton family, the Cox family, and Rupert Murdoch. At that level, most of your investments and speculations will crash, but the winners are large earners, and generate significant alpha. That *you* aren’t aware of this tells me that *you* are in fact the uninitiated here. 
The fraud behind Theranos was highly compartmentalized, and mostly only known after the fact. Watching a Netflix documentary doesn’t make you knowledgeable and witty.

Libra will be integrated into Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and several other services. So, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, your identity will be linked to your Libra address. 


As published in their technical paper, Facebook will maintain control and leadership of the project for an undefined amount of time. How many social networks do Visa and Mastercard own? Libra is primarily targeted at Facebook owned networks. The Calibra wallet, which will manage your Libra address, is a custodial wallet, fully controlled by Facebook, and will require KYC. 


You're in the Bitcoin subreddit. We're talking about cryptocurrencies. The things I have described cannot be done in Bitcoin or Ethereum, for instance. We're not comparing Libra to a bank account. We also have no established laws or guidelines regarding if and how governments can access these accounts. These are not bank accounts. Facebook has repeatedly shared user data without a warrant. 
In fact, Facebook is [notorious]( for leaking user data. You don't think they will be inclined to share financial data? Gee, I wonder why some might be skeptical?

Doh! You found the wrong guy to argue this with, mate.
I was actually a medical scientist at a major university! My graduate degree is in medical science, but that's beside the point. We're talking about the frequency with which billionaires invest in failed start-ups. We're not talking about talking about the merits of micro blood sampling. As an outsider, you never would have been privileged to proprietary data from Theranos prior to their collapse. If you somehow were, and if you were the intelligent scientist you claim to be, you would have found a way to secure yourself a net short position and make a lot of money! 
Now, if you were half as good at researching as you were at being a moron, you would know that Draper invested in Theranos because Holmes was a long time family friend and his former next door neighbor, not because he evaluated her engineering. You would also know that Draper invested 0.05% of his net worth into Theranos. For reference, if you earned $100k, it would be equivalent to you investing $50. 
Billionaires do this all the time, because they have enough capital to throw at everything, and reap the rewards of the winners. For instance, Eric Sprott is responsible for almost 25% of all junior gold mining VC!
My work here is done.

Or, government agencies will be allowed backdoor access to control and monitor people's accounts.
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:25:20


This has absolutely nothing to do with linking addresses to identities, or enforcing government actions. Do you know the identity of Bitcoin address owners? It's a public blockchain. 
If a Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or any other user is linked to a Libra address, it can be shared via backdoor access. It is a federated, permissioned network. This means if a government agency didn't like your social media post, they can obtain your Libra account information and freeze it.

It's not wrong. In FOREX it's called a "tomorrow next" and it's used to extend the settlement date of an open position past the closing day, so you never have to take delivery. The position is closed at the closing rate, and then re-opened the next day. It also comes with higher interest rates. I've never heard of a 4 hour rollover, but maybe that is specific to crypto.

It's a fee you pay to extend the settlement date of an open position. Day traders use this so they can delay taking delivery of whichever currency they buy, and take advantage of differences in currency rates. I personally do not do this in crypto, as it's generally a bad idea.

I have had several stop limits that did not execute as a result of "system lag" and "system interruptions". However, coins were still being sold and the price was still dropping. Only after the "lag" was I able to access my account, cancel my stops, and sell at the new low price. So, I don't think all cases are merely "suing because lag prevented them from logging in or starting a trade". I think Poloniex's TOS say they're not responsible anyway.

Except that Brave wants lots of users, and the users want to be able to access popular, modern websites. Brendan Eich has specifically spoken about this. If STUN requests are worrying you, then you can disable WebRTC, run a VPN, or get off your computer. Hey, you can also disable JS, wow! Where is the gimmick?


Every browser has memory leaks. A 5 second search could have taught you that. Brave is definitely not slow. Again, where is the gimmick? 


WebRTC is an issue for all browsers. If you're that worried, you can disable it, run extensions, or run a VPN. 
You're idea of a safe browser is one that sits on a disconnected computer, 100 miles underground. Please, move on...

I think it would be wiser to pull your quotes directly from a financial source, instead of wikipedia, or at least go to the direct source. 
However, if you want to use Wikipedia, we can.
Here is the definition from [wiki](


This is exactly how BTC has functioned since it's inception. I, and many others, have purchased, saved, retrieved, and at a later time, exchanged BTC. BTC has always retained purchasing power. 
Wikipedia also describes several types of stores of value, such as a currency, art work, and collectables. All with an unpredictable future market price. 


Again, this exactly describes BTC.
You're not helping your argument here.  
I understand there is a struggle for people to accept BTC as a store of value, but it factually is. These arguments often make the false equivalency of considering BTC like a stock. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:37:32


The future price is not what determines if something is a store of value. This is already demonstrated. If we accept your understanding, it means gold and silver are not a store of value, which would contradict not only the very definition, but reality, since both assets have been, and continue to be used as a store of value. 


So, this means you accept what a store of value truly is, and your argument is rather about whether Bitcoin is a "good" store of value or not. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:05:00
Are you trolling, or do you literally not understand what you're trying to talk about?
[Speculative store of value](
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:22:35
Well gosh, you're argument didn't make sense earlier, but now that you've called me an idiot, it all makes sense. 
Speculation is an act, it's not part of an assets definition. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:31:45
Except that never happened. 
Wikipedia is [not a valid source](
It's even less of a valid source when you cite it incorrectly, as you did. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:13:49
It's almost as if you are unaware of what you're pasting. I think you should look further into this so you understand the concept better. 


BTC is predictably useful when retrieved. Gold is predictably useful when retrieved. Silver is predictably useful when retrieved. This does not infer that you can predict the price, but rather that the asset has some sort of worth or function. 
The concept of predictable usefulness relates to an asset not depreciating in form or function, not in regards to its spot market price. For instance, gold is a good store of value because its physical form does not depreciate. Wheat is not a good store of value because its physical form does depreciate. BTC does not depreciate so long as the network functions. 
By your reasoning gold could never be a store of value, because it is not "predictable". Yet, reality would prove you wrong. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:00:35


As long as an assets value does not drop to zero, it retains purchasing power. Are you not aware of how much purchasing power USD has lost during it's existence? It's massive!


Traditionally fiat currency is not stable. Please refer to any number of countries, including the United States, who have government backed currencies that have experienced absolutely massive decreases in value. 


Wikipedia is not the lord of truth, and it doesn't say that. It states that cryptocurrency is not a traditional store of value. This is true. It is not traditional. 
My factual real-life examples &gt; Your misinterpreted quotes. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:48:31


Once again, this is a different argument. BTC literally functions as a store of value. This is not even a question. Whether it is a good store of value is debatable. 


I've already stated that I think wikipedia is a poor source for the argument, but regardless the key word here is "traditionally". No, BTC is not a traditional store of value. It is nascent, and thus more of a bleeding edge store of value. It's called digital gold for a reason.  
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:24:33
My friend, this argument was won a while ago. It's over now. Debating on what to invest in so I can send my children to college is an entirely different argument. 
Just my two cents, but I suggest you rely less on wikipedia for any future arguments, especially if you cannot even quote it accurately. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:17:01


LOL. It's literally the most primary source possible. 


Storing value does not necessitate a perpetual increase in value. Allow me to introduce you to a store of value called USD, which continually decreases in value. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:07:09
The history of Bitcoin, every user, every exchange, every purchase, every wallet, and every piece of protocol is my source. For many years BTC has been used to digitally store value. It's even happening this very moment. Real life observation is a much better source than misquoting a sentence on wikipedia. 


This makes no sense, and is irrelevant to anything we have discussed.

This increase is great, but I don't feel like it's substantiated considering the ongoing scaling debate, high fees, and slow transaction times. I feel like we're destined for a big correction some time soon. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:52:44
To be fair, some funds will have to remain on exchanges, or else you will have no trading and no price discovery. Hopefully lightning channels can solve some of the issues with having funds on an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:20:44
There was a recent post in r/btc that said Litecoin was crashing and thus SegWit doesn't work. It's a strange form of logic. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:08:55
Sounds fair enough!
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:51:22
That's a terrible example to use, considering the parabolic growth Bitcoin has had. Gaining $700 in a month, during a controversial time with high fees, delayed transactions, and mining conspiracies, is not "healthy".

Why not use cost averaging over time? It's one of the most efficient methods.

I don't think that's the case, but it should remain hot as long as it's the leading horse in the technology race. Bitcoin unfortunately has a serious governance issue, and it's stuck in the mud as a result.

How were you able to acquire Bitcoin on Coinbase without ever being able to access their site?
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:00:52
You can debate this forever. Correct 3 times does not equal "right every time". Darts thrown at a board could be correct hundreds of times. If TA worked, the turnover for day traders wouldn't be around 95%, and hedge funds would use it instead of quote stuffing, market making, and HFT. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:28:54
At no point did I say exchanges are "more safe". I was just correcting your analogy. When you hold money in an exchange, you do so knowing that there is a risk they may be negligent or malicious. When you purchase a physical product, which you own and control, you do not typically assume it was a false product.. well... at least not until now. This is all a moot point though.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:19:18
Seems a bit presumptuous to say you speak for everyone. Many people actually do want SegWit.

I've only ever seen discounts for paying with Bitcoin, as evidenced by the site that is pictured above, [Purse.io](

There is currently no time frame. Without consensus, we're stuck in gridlock. If you're just a hodler, sit tight. If you're a developer looking to toy with SegWit on mainnet, move over to Litecoin.

How would you like to pay?
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:33:27
Agreed. I think Japan is having an impact, but I'm hesitant to attribute all of these gains to that. Bitcoin is not very practical for retail purchases right now, so I can't imagine they're using it a lot. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:43:13

You're worth millions, but had to sell some bitcoin to pay off student loans?

It's great that you have had good fortune. Despite that, however, TA is still a retrograde system to identify and measure past trends. Warren Buffet didn't get rich by day trading.

I understand that, what I meant was, major exchanges are quickly updating, so it will be no surprise if SegWit txs follow shortly, as in, before several months.

Are there any instances of this happening? I don't see how it could access the passphrase unless malware was present and active at the time the passphrase was revealed. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:45:16
I can't determine which assets you should liquidate. It just sounded funny that you are worth so much money, and have experienced so many huge gains, yet you were unable to pay off student loans without selling bitcoin. It could very well be the best decision for you, but it just sounds funny.

Perhaps they have made gains, but typically those gains are smaller than if they had just bought and held. Still, the fact remains that most traders lose money. You're just an outlier. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:52:37
No, it's not the same. It would be like buying Bitcoin from an exchange and moving it to your own wallet, only the Bitcoin you purchased has secret code which allows the seller to render your Bitcoin inert or force it to transfer back to the owner. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:35:09
Certain situations require due dilligence. It sounds your transaction was affected by a glitch/bug, and it likely takes time to review how/why something like this happened before they automatically give you money.


You already initiated a sale at a previous price. I'm not sure how you're suffering a 70% loss?
@_date: 2017-05-12 02:12:15
I know a lot of people will be thrilled by this, but I think it's too much too fast, and without enough reason. Only reinforces the idea that it's a temporary bubble.

The problem is, we have no context regarding these accounts that get closed. There could be several reasonable answers. Traditional bank accounts and PayPal accounts get closed every day. This isn't an issue that only crypto has.

Might get flamed here, but this persistent bullshit and scaling gridlock is what forced me to start working with Litecoin and Ethereum. Lightning network and smart contracts are exciting, and at least I don't feel stuck in the mud anymore. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:33:13
I no longer use Bitcoin for commerce either, due to the high fees and delayed transactions.

What exactly are you on about?
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:33:07
Har, har! I think you missed the point. You cannot evaluate s&amp;d or price discovery without market trading. I understand the concern with having coins located on exchanges, but without trading, we never would have gotten to the price we're at now. This is why lightning channels are important.

Haha. I'm not trying to troll you, just giving you some perspective. 


Every time you refresh the page or try to execute another transaction, the payment source resets to the default checking account, even if you never leave the buy page. You have to manually select the credit card option every time. Based on your story, this is exactly what happened. It was not Coinbase that changed anything, it was you not noticing this change.
