there is a good deal more to it than this. Dec 27 2011 Satoshi took measures to renew bitcoin.org bitcoin.net bitcoins.org +5y. Then he passed bitcoin.org off to Sirius whom added another year to the renewal, common practice/requirement when transferring ownership. One sees for this domain that it changed to a Finish registrar with the transfer. But bitcoin.net and bitcoins.org never moved from the original anonymous registrar. This implies that Satoshi did not just give the domains bitcoins.net and bitcoins.org to this "anonymous person" that Theymos mentions... but in-fact he would have given them the satoshi user account login credentials on the registrar. The risk and unlikeliness of this is increased when considering that those credentials would also give the person access to his email account he used for much of his communication ( as this was also provided as a webmail account attached to his registrar account. So this "anonymous person". So I believe this was someone that knew Satoshi in a very personal way as he was okay with the risk that they may impersonate him, or it was Satoshi himself.

Personally I support the end of drug prohibition if for no other reason than the warped and out-dated correctional system in the US. I feel silkroad was a valuable counter. However, the end of prohibition should come through laws and not anarchy and I expect that whomever DPR is knew the consequences.

these are seperate contact details. When I made my orders I put in completely false "asdasdasd" details for billing and real contact details for shipping. done. the advantage of bitcoin is that the seller does not have any charge back or forging issues so there is really no need for the to require contact details. filling them in "honestly" is up to the buyer should the buyer want some sort of connection and recourse.

I'm not sure if I understand why making an exit would be part of the motive. If my mining company is making profit I'd probably rather keep it going. If I can move the market up to set baseline (paint the tape) by burning some capital this seems like a good investment. The profits then taking as per usual, eventually recouping the pump-capital invested as well. ... Also this theory may apply to other bitcoin based companies such as any looking to get another series N infusion from VC's. (more on that here if interested 
@_date: 2016-06-22 08:51:28
I don't trade.
I didn't predict this latest swing. I was more thinking of longer term movements. Also if what is happening now is a manipulation, if it were by miners I would expect that they would want to be sure price remains above 500 to keep their mining costs level after the halving. But I suppose if the "external event" that creates interest is the halving itself there is another two weeks where someone with capital could drive in new users (that tend to hold) and take another shot at shaving off profits.
In an unregulated opaque market it seems it would be irresponsible to NOT move and manipulate the market. I wonder how transparency at exchanges could prevent manipulation. Isn't something akin to the SEC exactly what all the anarchists of Bitcoin want to avoid desperately?
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:35:07
exit today perhaps? perhaps not. Though I would think that all miners have a rolling exit strategy. The only thing that changes, like any investor, is how much to hold in equity (btc) and how much in cash
basically moving the market could be done when there is some "other developments" that on their own may not have much effect but if you pump or dump at that time other people join the wave thinking that the "other development" actually does have such an effect. Pump on etherium news, dump when some exchange has a hickup... rinse,repeat. Do this often enough and keep enough on the side so that every 4 years you can shift the price up to keep your mining operation profitable... then keep repeating the cycle shaving off from everyone else riding your waves.

the mtgox scandal showed how easily this market can be manipulated when you have enough weight. I think the skyrocketing ahead of halving isn't new people becoming interested and buying in.

This market is still too imature to think it can resist strong manipulation. This is what this shows.

Thinking outloud about measuring lost coins.
Say I drop $1 into my couch. In 10 years we see on the blockchain that the $1 has not moved couches. What are the probabilities that gave it to some messy stoner that also hasn't bothered to clean it, re-installed the couch, threw the couch into the dump, or found the $1 and I'm just keeping my eye on it? Probabilities? Do they change if its $10, $100 or $1000?
The same can be applied with 1BTC. If 1BTC has not moved for 10 years (back when it was worth $1) then the probabilities remain mostly unchanged.

Here is a better idea. Make a Satoshite Coin metric which represents all tokens that have been docile for as long as Satoshi's have.

I agree with rewarding investment. But I think it might be healthy if benefits from rewards expire. But that is only one possible fork of many that could all be explored.


The current reward system comes with too much hereditary based bias. Some is probably necessary but I believe we can debate and explore varying levels of it. I'm not arguing for this because of poverty as much as lost human potential.

miner and others with large stake in the network will make certain to move the market in a direction that keeps their investments at least level, that means moving the market to a point where their electricity is paid. Think i'm kidding, go look at the history of mtgox's market moving. This is what you get with markets that are completely unregulated. For better or worse all the mining whales are going to make certain price increases %25 per year so that their investments don't belly up. Such great news, until it isn't.

I agree, the investor/faith reward system has worked out debatably well.. But this basis of reward isn't any different from what we've had. The argument is this isn't a revolution, just a digital remake of the same reward system we've always had. Where Bitcoin has it better than Etherium is that the early adopter appears to have voided a large part of the traditional reward for himself/herself. At least for now.
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:19:08
Unless the person you are paying plans to keep the payment in bitcoin, then I wouldn't use bitcoin. I've gone over this in detail in the past as I had to send $5000 to someone in the US. It made no sense. Once you calculate in exchange fees you will find it cheaper to just use a bank, and even just a wire transfer service
@_date: 2016-07-01 10:41:29
but I am an very early adopter. I start any questions of privilege by first looking at my own. The incentives of Bitcoin are setup properly with a very limited vision of the future, one tied very strongly to the past. And they might be the right incentives for now. But I think all of us can think beyond that. My position here is probably flawed on many levels, and I appreciate people giving me kickback for.
My problem is the ideal of liberation through technological decentralization when that is meant to apply to everything but wealth.

judging from the multitude of optional extensions mentioned here that already provide micro-transactions, basically no it will never be possible. each extension would have limited exposure in a sea of alternatives with each certainly having a greater than absolute 0 friction to intializating its use. basically you'll have some uber or centralized application and likely corporation specific sidechains. good luck with that

Joint coin mixing, or did i miss something? The linked code provides a tor based server that N participants connect to for mixing. Server does not store coins or handle signing. Server does send mixing instructions to clients and broadcast final messages to network.
A more verbose description of the protocol can be found on the [bitcointalk forum]( and I'm sure im missing some details. 
current bounty (in a jointly signed escrow with known devs and forum mods) for implementation of protocol described by gmaxwell on forum is [14btc]( Surprisingly low IMHO but perhaps people are not unified in what anonymous hardening solution to push. gmaxwell provides a comparison of Coinjoin to other proposals in the forum thread linked above.

1 is recoverable. 2 isn't important if not widespread. after all,as you said, maybe it will happen and most people wont even know. 3 would only reduce the value back to $10 or $2 because there are still plenty of grey and black market uses.  is a real threat but one that can be protected by the laws of the land, if the bitcoin foundation have enough lawyers by then. 5 will be fixed democratically through code, as its not clear if we want to abandon the wonderful potential of micropayments just yet.
So, if you're worried about it staying at $200, worry. if you are worried about it going to $0, the arguments do not support it.

The dates of the spike directly relate to the april bubble and burst. Change [scale to 60 days]( 
April 1st was a major upward trend in the exchange rate of BTC. April 10th was the burst of a bubble. April 12 it hit bottom. April 16 it hit bottom again. By April 19 it stabalized.
If you relate this to the bitcoin days destroyed you'll major see movements from April 1 to April 19.

yes, and have enjoyed them immensely but felt that their hesitance on the NSA issue to be revealing. It could be that for a more popular audience they chose to play middle ground. Or it could be that living in NYC with first hand experience of the event that lead to the bastardisation of civil liberties they still felt reason to avoid provocation. But I've also experienced this without it blinding me entirely. I survived a terrorist attack and an attempted shooting as a pedestrian (when visiting Israel during the second intifada) and still find lots of question in the NSA scandal (and Israel's action too, btw). If Colbert and Stewart are only there to question the media they had plenty of chance to look at how the media demonised Snowden but they didnt, or Greenwald but didnt. If their purpose, as I thought it is, was also to use satire to provoke novel intellectual questioning they really dropped the ball, instead reserving their debate to the post privacy understanding ("you give all your data to facebook already") without even going anywhere interesting with that either.

I'm suprised no one mentioned this. In relation to the TX vs Market Capitalisation graph... remember satoshidice? It accounted for 50+% of all TX's in its day as it utilised the blockchain. Now casinos all severed themselves from that level of activity on the chain. Next, remember Silk Road?
It doesn't give a complete answer but enough to greatly question and investigate further
What the chart may show is that big money is continuing to get into bitcoin as a means of investment or storage of value. Yes, it's being squirrelled away is what this says but it does not mean this is a bubble. It means scarcity is increasing. This increases the value which brings more horders, slowly pushing the services and utility side (actually buying stuff with it) into a smaller slice.

The US has little issue with writing laws with inconsistant caveats. The examples are endless. However it is clear that there is "demand" and reason for digital cash, regardless if it is anonymous or not, regulated or not. 0 friction purchasing is about to happen (selling/buying on ebay requires 4 users accounts. With a digital currency like Bitcoin you could in theory need none. That == more sales). If regulators are conscious of this is an entirely different matter. And regardless of regulation the psuedo-anonymous features of bitcoin will mean that there is always a market. The code for silk road isn't going to get thrown into the bin just because bitcoin is gone, and neither will interest in borderless gambling. If necessary, and perhaps as a result of regulation, users will be accustomed to accessing internet services like Iranians and Chinese do, through anonymous networks. In my opinion I welcome unregulated innovation in digital currency as we have now but I also welcome regulation that spurs innovation.
   *"The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."* -- John Gilmore, Time magazine, December 1993
In fact one could argue that this regulation is necessary to encourage innovation. Initial use of Bitcoin was for that (aka Silkroad). What would have happened if say drugs were legal and there was no reason for Silkroad? What would have happened if Internet gambling were still legal in the US? Years ago Bitcoin was percieved with a bias towords its subversive elements and early innovation should thank regulation. Now people are starting to see that Bitcoin has huge value far beyond the subversive and innovation is taking place there. My point: regulation is not bad for innovation and even if such innovation starts out subversive it could have much greater impact in the overt with time.

im not sure i understand. even with bitcoin there are a few levels of trust. trust of the code when you update revisions without reading every line, trust of the nodes you connect to, etc. my point was this distribution  of trust, this trust model, does not change when BTCGuild represents %100 of hashing power. Likewise, the users give a similar level of trust to BTCGuild as they do the bitcoin developers, and in the same way they can just as easily shift their trust elsewhere. Therefore, in the end we give blind trust to bitcoin developers whom the community trusts because those developers have proven their interests align. I'm not arguing for but would like to interject that BTCGuild might be more trust worthy a pool than many others. (disclaimer: i do not use btcguild, i do not mine and i do not know anyone involved with btcguild).

**Cryptofinance interprets non-consensus intervention as a bug to be patched by iteration**
Authorities attempt to eliminate will only wipe out the savings of those that are gambling on Bitcoin as a store of value but will have no effect on utility. The 2011 crash showed this clearly (sidenote, just mapped this in a [post today](04/21/bitcoin-utility-and-speculation/)). Further, if dispute this they chose to attempt to destroy it you can be certain that the out lash from the destruction of wealth and general challenge would bring plenty of copy cats but other crypto currencies still that would innovate around it.

abc532 I know you are pretty mad but opening more and more threads to just say the same thing isnt the route. if share price (rather than dividends) is what you really care about you should just see this as a short term opportunity that a few people (mpex whales) got to enjoy... for certain your share price will be back up to 007 at some point. i bought at this rate as well but i actually welcome the share price readjustment. i'd rather see shares closer to the real value of the company rather than hyper inflated just because investors got no where else better to put their money.

When looking at S.DICE you shouldn't treat it as a traditional stock, in my opinion. That is, I wouldn't invest in S.DICE with the intent of gaining from stock value fluctuations. Rather, investing in S.DICE should be based on the dividend returns. The advantage of BTC placed in S.DICE is that if the value of BTC goes down there is a chance that players would continue to play simply with more BTC. As a result dividends will be higher in BTC when BTC's value goes down.

The title is misleading, silly, meaningless. Comparison
just-dice.com "generated" over $120,000,000 in same time.
"generated" is a misleading description for "wagered". if a gambler plays with 1BTC, bets at %98, they could potentially keep betting for a long time before seeing a loss or win that causes them to cash in and leave. In the process the 1BTC they brought to the table significantly inflates the BTC waged (aka "generated"), many times over.
So the title means nothing

All possible but less plausible. does not mean it could not be the case but starting rather from more likely assumption while trying to disprove each. See being anonymous is not an easy task. I spent years working with multiple personas as a job and know this issue intimately. Each abstraction add's latency. Latency is counter to human desire and intuition, to get something done quickly rather than deal with all the headaches required to be paranoid about every little detail. So it is safe to start with some reasonable assumptions and work back from there.

The current means most people use to purchase bitcoins, especially new users, make the effect from positive press delayed by one to two weeks. mtgox takes a week or actually two weeks to validate new accounts. then there might be more time for funds to get into mtgox accounts. and then people buy. what you saw was this delay after the end of year news and the $510k investment in bitinstant and other news articles. there was a rush of new users but it took two weeks for them to start buying.

Just as one example, the [3rd richest]( bitcoin addr [moved]( most of their funds on March 30 from [1Co6UHJmGHevWEHAPraSPRVkfGgG46EHwe]( to [17UUsmejDsjJEtbRcotd289ADp7ZdanH5k]( (making the latter the 2nd richest address now, btw). The majority of coins that came into 1Co6U were likely from major mining operations from middle 2012 to the end (most inputs in 50btc blocks). So that would mean the recent movement was of coins from 6+ months old. So at least 7,000,000 "bitcoin days" destroyed (40k coins * (30*6)).
But that is march 30th. As mentioned elsewhere, the spike in april directly relates to the bubble and burst

this video is only accurate for sums around or less than $1000. It's completely misleading for anything over that. It's getting tiring hearing it parroted. While bitcoin may be cheaper most exchanges have costs and major delays making it not worth the head ache. And pretty much ALL exchanges have these costs and delays when the amount to transfer is over $5k. And if you get in the $25k or more range you can just forget about transferring your money using exchanges for a good few months. And no p2p exchange has the volume so going that route will take a long time as well.
Conclusion: If you are going to use bitcoin for something more than $5k, dont.
(Disclaimer, I've been trying to utilise bitcoin for large transfers for several months now so if someone proves me wrong I would be very happy)

"to allow users to transfer money to their contacts over the BlackBerry Messenger service". It's another walled garden. I attended DLDConference this year and listened to telcoms, paypal and other execs speak about how they were making efforts to break the mobile payment markets but the technologies they mentioned are all gardens that are failing or waiting for some reason to use them (NFC is about the least of the walled garden techs and even this is failing).

How would the electricity usage compare to say someone using lamps to grow marijuana? I ask because I know that in many places electricity usage is monitored, not just by building owners but by power companies and then the police, in order to spot elicit activity. Technically mining is still a legal use of electricity but I question if the amount of electricity used does not bring unwanted attention. So, would the electricity required for mining 700 to 1000eu worth of coin fall into the same category?
In any case, this question deviates from the original. Still I would like to find an apartment where the cold rent is paid in bitcoin.

Yes I would agree. A 10 year outlook on bitcoin is completely different as the necessity has not materialised (yet?). For anything i invest in the past couple months i evaluate on short term goals. What I invested a year ago still is solid for longer term. But... as I've told most of my friends and colleagues... 
bitcoin is a gamble but one that is only as irresponsible as holding fiat in a low interest savings account. modern economics dictates that every form of investment of personal surplus is a gamble. the only way to avoid that headache is to negotiate less work hours or get on welfare.
What changes for me with the current market makeup is that unlike holdings from a year ago that I think are very solid for the next couple years, what I invest now is short term and requires more maintenance. For me that means I take "what im willing to risk" divide it by 4 and invest/play/arbitrage with that. I generally do not encourage or advise people to "get into" bitcoin but if they do this is the advice i give.

This sounds like protectionist propaganda from someone trying to protect their position in the market. What the NYT, the Guardian and specifically Bruce Schneier working on the NSA documents for the Guardian show is that the statements in the documents do not clearly mean that the NSA has found mathematical flaws allowing them to break strong crypto but also does not definitely mean that they did not.
Yes the NSA has an easier job breaking end-point security as the video claims but the documents cover a much broader range of avenues of research and attack then just that.
Schneier spends some time putting back into light suspected cryptographic flaws and rumours of them in relation to the NSA from the past couple years. One in particular relates to the use of elliptic curve crypto.

the depiction of bubbles bursting is that the wealth simply vanishes. but the housing market is infact recovering. if you invested in housing with a 10 to 15 year outlook you will likely recover  this is because if the fundamentals of what you are investing in are sound, such as is the case with housing, it will recover. Baring significant challenge from competing technology, or chinese-style-cracking-down of bitcoin by the EU or US, the fundamentals and utility of bitcoin are sound.

it seems to me that retip points out a valid concern about centralisation due to discrepancy in resources. one of the counter responses is that we do not know how the behaviour of mining economics will change as a result. i agree that it's not something we should worry ourselves with too much but it IS something to discuss and potential backup solutions if retip's theory of mining economics turns out to be more true than currently foreseen. I'd like to see the discussion venture more into a response for potential future use rather than just outright throwing the issue away. Bitcoin is a system that can be changed and one of the greatest stabilities for further adoption is that showing that potential concerns have likely solutions should they be needed. This is already the case with various other weaknesses and shouldn't be any different for this one.

for in person purchases yes. bitcoin makes no sense for that. but for online purchases it can be a lot easier. for example, when looking for a vpn i tried out a few. first i tried paypal but for whatever reason on one vpn provider my paypal account, attached to my bank account, was not good enough and paypal.com asked for an additional credit card. switched to paying with btc and it WAS a lot easier. Even if just from the standpoint of not needing to log in, or create a new account, and not running into these odd restrictions.
I've used paypal in tons of places but every once in a while you run into some edge case where the normal way of working does not work well. another example is when purchasing items from country A with paypal/bank in country B and shipping to country C -- most payment processors go haywire.

I would also suggest that you have a electronic or paper agreement on the final amount before the actual trade of goods. there was a post on reddit a few days ago where someone purchased headphones through craigslist using bitcoin and the seller, after seeing in person that the transaction took place, just got up and left with the headphones claiming "you didn't pay for them". The buyer then "felt" they had no footing because if they ran the seller down the seller could always say they received nothing.
my point is, even though you are the seller and hence taking less risk, if you sell with optional bitcoin via craigslist start with a culture that encourages other sellers to say via email before meeting what the price is, exchange of bitcoin addresses, so that there is some proof in-case things go sour.

FAQ says you purchase the coin and they send it to you at specified times of the day when the price is set. So this is more like a bitcoin store rather than exchange. Also, %4.95 fee on buying, %2 on selling. Better than nothing i guess. Would still be nice to see either a p2p or real exchange.

I'm not sure i understand David Perry's description and the blockchain.info Transaction vs Trade ratio charts. Am I correct, they do not take into account movement of BTC for the purpose of speculation? As he described: moving BTC between exchanges for arbitrage, or a pump/dump bot moving BTC between local accounts on an exchange, would appear in the Transaction category? Meaning if this type of speculative behaviour were to increase it would make the ratio appear stable and appear that *there is more money being moved around the BTC economy* when in fact it is not?
Meaning, could it not be that the speculation activity increased so drastically that even marginal movement of BTC required for some types of speculative activity in the segment dwarfed possible increases in genuine utility (use, non-speculative activity)?

Update: I've been looking at the commit log for the first 6 months. If he is in
* West Coast USA (UTC-8), works from 7am to 10pm. 
* East Coast (UTC-4), works 11am to 2am
* UK (UTC), works 2pm to 6am
* Japan (UTC+8), works 11pm to 3pm.
Or put another way. There are no commits during the following hours (silence):
* UTC-8: silence from 22:00 until 06:00
* UTC-4: silence from 02:00 until 10:00
* UTC: silence from 06:00 until 14:00
* UTC+8: silence from 15:00 until 23:00
* [Commits from first 6 months, UTC](
* [All commits, UTC](
Based on this i would say he is not in Japan (never working in the evening??). I also find UTC-4 (east coast USA) more plausible then all the others though depending on the nature of code commits then perhaps UTC (UK region) could be posible.

well put. presents enough of an answer to cause thought. Now I would bring up the issue that equal tax, passed up supply and consumption chains, would make giving tax breaks for those that are poorer difficult or impossible. Those better off will pay less tax as their % of consumption to % of their wealth will be much lower on average than those that are not as well off. Opinions as to if that is a good or bad are rather divided and for those that feel it is a bad thing bitcoin provides a disadvantage for their belief.

the person selling his account has no money on the account.
if you invest 10btc on just-dice and over 6 months make a 1btc profit then just-dice will take a commission on that 1btc when you eventually take your btc out of the site. if however you lost 1btc instead, when you take your money out just-dice will take no commission. Say you lost that, took your 9btc left  out but now you would like to invest back in again. You put 9btc and overtime make a 1btc profit. When you take your total 10btc out now you still have not made a profit over the history of your account so, no commission.
The user selling his account has a 329btc minus (loss). That means he will have to make that amount back before the site ever charges a commission. What he is trying to sell is an account empty of btc but with a large 329btc minus on the site's ledger. if you invested on a fresh account and made 329btc profit it would cost you around 30 to 40+ btc in commissions. So by purchasing his account for the requested amount (20 or so BTC) you make more profit by having to pay less commission.
hope its clear.

There is actually a lot that is predictable with BTC. But not price. The last two jumps I've seen, most recently mid Jan 2013, were due to increased number of new users. New users have a delayed effect due to the amount of time it takes to get verified by an exchange and then transfer money. You could almost time it. Jan 1 the $500k investment news + news about bitcoin casinos + news about other online casinos considering accepting bitcoin. That is a lot of publicity. To add to this, I registered my first verified Mtgox account on Dec 31. My account was verified around Jan 14-15 due to "high number of new accounts" according to MTGox support. On the 16th/17th the spike started. I would assume that even now we are still seeing the result of new accounts coming into play as their transfers of $/€/£ are starting to get into their exchange accounts. After my account was verified I transfered some funds. Only today did they become active in my account. So I would expect another week of rising.

Lack of services. There are not enough services to encourage people to use them. The result is something that looks way inflated and much like a pony scheme. Without more services utilising Bitcoins benefits the current value of BTC will have to adjust back down to $2 to $10 within the next 8 months. It is also more services that will make BTC resistent to intervention and regulation. If there is not a rich service community by the end of the year Bitcoin might be reserved for use in grey market services for the next 5 to 10 years..

From other details I've seen about the company my impression is that Gox has ethical rules that make them lean toward avoiding interference. Other exchanges do not and one or two got burned in the past when it was revealed they were working with arbitrage.

same set of shoes. Had a small amount of saving collecting dust and put a share of into BTC long ago. Let's face it, we got lucky because bitcoin is something we were qualified to evaluate due to our field. Now dealing with upper-middle-class problems that you describe. Not enough to buy a house (wtf, why is it that in 2013 housing is still the only tangible thing we can imagine putting our sweat safely into??) so i held. I cashed some btc in to invest in real world opportunities. Namely a business of a family member. That minor investment element paired with the altruistic element diminished the perceived weight of the loss aversion neurological stimulus from not holding (read How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer). I feel great on that and would do it again. Point is, you may find more ways to pull out portions if/when you feel it is wise. Other than that, or something seriously wrong being discovered with bitcoin (and you will probably know about that long before your ROI is effected much), avoiding the day trader mentality is the only thing you have to be vigilant with. Also, as a tip, ignore other people around you. People whose skin is not in the game but are only connected to it by their interest in you, and excitement for you, will have even more trouble in trying to avoid the day trader mentality. Even though they hold no BTC they will watch it closely and every once in a while give you their couch based advice to take advantage of volatility, or strong movements, or arbitrage. Ignore them. You have skin in the game and your intuition is obviously better.

The reason this is worth considering is the psychological effect of walls. Someone selling 1000btc might assume the 5k btc wall is solid and as such place their ask below the wall because they dont care to wait longer than 24h (or the length of time required by volume to eat away the wall). So they put it bellow the wall. This is the purpose of the phantom wall, force asks lower.
The wall moved from the $110 range, to $115 to now $125. Investors should just be aware of phantom walls especially in highly volatile moments, and place their asks irregardless of them

purchased food and drinks at a restaurant a few times. i invested in some stocks that give dividends (satoshidice for example). i pay for various internet services (vpn, vps) not for the anonymity but because in many cases paying with btc is just way quicker and easier than other options. i own some namecoin via btc (proud owner of satoshi.bit :).
the ease of purchase with btc is really a selling factor. i think i will start to hold some fiat where i can convert to btc quickly and create a petty cash pool this way to purchase using the amazon proxy's or the all purpose purchase proxies.

It is interesting to see the EFF lag behind other companies and organisations already adopting this questionable technology. Really? Archive.org and Wordpress.com lawyers beat you to it EFF? &gt;Unimpressed&lt;.
"It is possible that the legal and/or technical landscape has changed enough in the last couple of years "
Last couple years? Your people that had a question and answer on Reddit didn't even have the courage to answer simple questions about it a couple months ago. Sounds more like the official policy at the EFF was already set some time ago and reaffirmed even recently. And yes, of course you are going to change your gag order on speaking about it now. you'd look rather odd not to make some sort of opinion.
They should be taking this seriously and positioning themselves, even if neutral, to provide guidance and advice to both government and consumers alike. If what many say turns out to be true and years from now people will discuss the Internet in the context of its importance for facilitating the future of capital, then the EFF is doing themselves a diservice to not be absolutely on top of the topic. They do not have to accept bitcoins, but they should be at the forefront of understanding and knowledge on the topic and not have to send questions off to some desk in a backroom for answer. They should have FAQ's and guidance documents at the forefront and they should already have a strategy in place concerning their potential involvement in future disputes on this front by categorising and thinking privately about what types of legal battles will arrise and which they should (and should not) champion.

Would help if you were a bit more descriptive on what your needs are for fiat withdrawal or moving. most exchanges are pretty responsive with fiat deposits and similarly sound for btc movements between exchanges. some have coupon systems that are compatible with each other for 0 confirmation btc movement (mtgox coupons supported between btc24 and mtgox, for example). The issue is getting fiat from one exchange to the other.

cost to execute a 51% attack was estimated at $8m upfront back then, with no running costs (completely covering electricity costs and maintenance with btc profits). Meaning, 8m upfront and then execute the attack at will for however long you wish. Forget the US Government, at some point, it would be worth executing the attack sparsely just to f'up the market for brief moments to buy and sell during panics.

I feel strange saying it but we should push weight toword unsystem, amir and others. i'd prefer amorality but in absence of that i'd support the religious privacy push to counter this absurd popularisation organisation. if the bitcoin foundation cannot maintain the right balance then the next thing will be a push for gavin and core devs to leave, and failing that would be a push for a different cryptocurrency. the result of the latter probably being bitcoin being the popular bastardised currency with stronger privacy concious versions taking flight. this isnt a a bad thing btw.

I've been looking at arbitrage out of curiosity and wrote an article describing my findings after a few days of using the Google Spreadsheet I posted before. To summarize:
* it is possible to make a profit but requires a headache of resource buffer
* if you take into account volume, one sees that the ask / bid difference between exchanges is sometimes inflated perhaps by an exchange or not to their benefit. In any case, rule of thumb: ALWAYS look at volume not just spread of ask / bid. This applies to more than just arbitrage as well.

The bubble i see is the difference between increase in market value to increase of utility. $2 million in sales for bitpay, okcupid/reddit/&lt;insert_some_ecommerce_here&gt; accepting it for payment, all representing increase in utility which does not compare to the increase in value, in my humble opinion. perhaps I need to recalibrate my scales. Actually not. In a year if the innovation in utility increases at a snails pace in comparison to the increase in market value then ill recalibrate. Until then this space represents very high risk. It should be the same for everyone else. If you invest now, be happy going shirtless for a while. But im also certain it will recover. Because what I see as being tangible in the space of utility in relation to bitcoin is immense and unexplored still.

tl;dr: 
1 housing is the staple store of value for middle-class. In many places housing has a monopoly in this area. 2 a limited segment of society can utilise this (need $50k or so for entry). Bitcoin competes on both. While bitcoin may be too volatile to consider it as a store of value, it may be the lack of other options for many classes of society that leads to prematurely calling it a store of value instrument.

He does not explain how society could deal with problems without having monetary policy as a tool. Neither has anyone in the bitcoin community. It is clear that the monopoly is what we are changing but not clear how this is going to play out for benefit or detriment.

I agree the math using SR revenue isn't a measurement at all. It only looks nice. I mentioned it anyway because it less nonsensical, even if only slightly less, then a lot of the other numbers people throw out. I feel the thrust of the article intends to say that even if we cannot graph utility when more bitcoin businesses provide numbers and data we can get a better sense of it still
Your comment is refreshingly sound and I feel the same on the current ratio of speculation vs utility movement.

first flaw, assuming bitcoin is a currency. it's okay when contemplating the speculative value alone but the "fundamentals" of bitcoin that influence its value are much broader than trade. that has a loop back effect on value. second, even in relation to a currency bitcoin and others will overtime decentralize trust. in 10 to 15 years as societies internalise the following understanding  then Greenspans arguments will be useless and dated: That the collective with rules arbitrated through crypto are as trust worthy as a reputable institution or individual. As Freud put it in a letter to Einstein: ["right is the might of a community"](

I'm not saying I agree fully. Certainly making legal innovation and use of a p2p digital currency illegal will push it to the back pages of illicit activity. I would argue though that even this would not drive it to worthlessness. I would add though that if the USG or other institutions do not make an effort to tamper Bitcoins grown in 2013, then by the end of 2013 it will be clear that the idea of digital currency has immense benefit socially and for traditional **commerce**.

Really? First, not sure where this was ever declared. And I could imagine several applications having nothing to do with gambling where the total transfered is not specified in advance. 
The issue here is will Bitcoin support micro-payments or not? Or will they take the route of MPEX and say "this is the main branch, for everything else pay a premium and use a sub branch".

oh man, everyone loves their fantasy's and comparisons. Paypal grew threw utility whereas the currently growth of Bitcoin is through speculation primarily, utility second. The 2 year "setback" to bitcoin as you called it was nothing such. It was a hump that people should expect to reoccur as speculation outpaces utility. does not mean it will not be as significant as paypal but they do not really compare and bitcoin's evolution and path will be very different in nature than paypals.

this speculation was based on the first output of the large 1B1w address to the Faucet 15Vj just days before the Faucet was getting active. But yes, i guess another route of speculation would be looking at the first input to the Faucet address that you linked to. In any case, appears that first output from 1B1w to 15Vj was for escrowing as Gavin might have been using 15Vj for his clearcoin escrowing service based on the history for 15Vj.
