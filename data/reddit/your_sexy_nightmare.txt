Do you think this is the final downward slope? Or do you think some deflation will do it some good and allow more skeptical people to buy in because it's cheaper and "less risky"

Can I ask what people (realistically) think this means for the value of BTC? I'm excited and curious.

I don't know, I guess there is just something inherently cautious about trusting thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins to a company with no real understanding of how or where it is stored. And since everything is just on a computer, the fear of them getting hacked and thus me losing everything, doesn't seem like a comfortable risk. You could argue that banks are no different, and I would agree with you, but banks have FDIC baking. Convince me I'm wrong.

That's awesome! Could you give a time line of value (in your opinion) given this recent news?

So if I use CoinBase, would I only be buying and selling from other CoinBase users? Could I move my coins from the CoinBase wallet to a different wallet?

I've heard a lot about security as far as keeping your key somewhere physical. How does this increase security and what does it entail?

Can I ask what makes you feel so strongly about your position?

I suppose all the constant posts about new items and retailers meshing with Bitcoin. New stores allowing it's use and new products being purchased with it.

In the US, hoping to get 22 of them

Okay great. Thanks for all the insight! I'll probably get started with CoinBase, and just move things to a paper wallet if I become convinced the company is in choppy waters.
