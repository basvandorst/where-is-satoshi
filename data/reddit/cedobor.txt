Nah it makes it pennies
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:08:17
Stop using exchanges that don't use segwit. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:04:03
It's for transaction fees so it's not like $500 to splash. You'll be able to pay for crypto with fiat on the exchange.

@_date: 2018-01-03 17:26:41


what do you mean?
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:32:26
Nah just things I've learned reading articles
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:31:45
 scroll down on the link
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:47:17
Is it possible to do 2 kyc's with one ID?
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:00:51
If it is deployed and batching status is no, are they still sending segwit transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:18:26
I don't get tether. How can a cryptocurrency function if it is pegged to a fiat?
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:28:30
And this is still a bitcoin address? I can send the coins on that to a coinbase account?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:42:00
Could you explain?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:32:29
Oh I see. Wtf that's wild. Is there a maximum fee? I'm still waiting for verification so I can't even send anything yet
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:07:14
Got it. Thanks for the information. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:25:38
Thank you. You really helped.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:22:18
What is he using to get his number?
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:14:41
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:25:34
Oh okay. Thank you very much for all your help :) 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:59:23
Oh idk then I haven't made my first bitcoin investment yet
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:39:45
What's a node with a high degree? A channel that a lot of people can go through?
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:12:04
Thank you very much.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:41:38
Less hash power = less computing power? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:40:08
:D your name is oddly familiar to mine 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:11:06
Dope. Except I have an android
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:05:25
Solely plastic so I won't get tagged by a metal detector and then my wallet seized by bad security?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:50:23
"doubling time" the time they doubled the last figure they posted?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:55:24
Are there any scalability proposes that don't involve a channel party (a channel larger than 2) having loads of btc ready in their account?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:08:53


What do you mean?
Also how will shorts affect bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:31:55
hold till at least 2019
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:34:42
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:50:43
Oh okay. Thank you. By reserve you mean like the bitcoins in the vault?
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:30:00
Thank you. What are they using to get their numbers?
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:22:22
Is there a link to the blockchain so we can see the transactions going into the blocks and the new coins being mined?
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:05:39
So what should I make of his number? I imagine bitcoin will beat that at some point
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:02:31
Is the interest just the profit from the price going lower?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:32:31
And they'll ask for your seed?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:06:35
That's fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked. So what about transaction fees in ln nodes? Do users set that too?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:00:56


So how does it work? Is it a) computer gets a problem to solve if it solves it it gets the bitcoin? Does each computer get a unique problem to solve?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:15:44
What about long term scalability?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:26:30
Thank you. Can't oracles hoard bitcoins and then ruin stuff for everyone else by imposing the fees they want? How are channel fees calculated?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:19:42
I'm still new to bitcoin. Is the payment channel what the person considers "centralisation?" Did LN come after segwit? Thank you for the information.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:50:22
Will BTC cash have a separate coin cap?
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:02:22
I'm new to bitcoin (well investing in it)
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:06:26
The article doesn't explain what a Schnorr signature is 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:14:56
Does Jihan really own 50% of bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:59:40
So the transaction fee is in bitcoins? And damn so the miner gets to pick who to accept?
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:26:13
Oh I apologise. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:51:42
bittylicious 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:05:40
Thank you. Does it have as many coins mined as BTC or is it starting at 0?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:45:05
But what is making bitcoin mining more expensive?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:55:14
Oh? So every 10 minutes there's only so much new bitcoins you can mine regardless of hash power?
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:41:41
So it's just using the name Lightning for face value like Bcash? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:22:53
Who sets fees?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:25:24
Oh okay. Thank you very much for all your help :) 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:57:12
Halving? Every few years the amount that you can mine is halved until all bitcoin is mined in 2140?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:51:10
I apologise I wrote my response before seeing your updated one. So it gets cheaper then those people can mine again. Why is it that the more people are doing it the more it costs? You mean like more computers mining bitcoins = overall money spent on mining coins is higher? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:37:44
Isn't there only one payment channel between 2 people?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:15:03
Thank you very much.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:58:30
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:26:37
What if the outcome was incorrect? E.g. it's posted that Brazil won then fifa comes out like "oops sorry Argentina won" because they broadcasted the incorrect results. Would Alice be able to get her money from Bob?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:45:18
What jobs are being created with the growth of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:59:16
I'm waiting for verification but the website uses segwit adresses
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:40:52
 he says it around 2:44. Could you give any other examples after listening? It's like 20s
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:17:11
Just looked up on it. Neither does yet so I'll just stick to coinbase. They say it takes like 7 days before your money goes into coinbase. Is it the same with gemini?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:27:48


If your bitcoin is borrowed and sold how do you get your bitcoin back? Does the exchange have bitcoins and it then reimburses your account?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:19:29
So a hardware wallet or a wallet like electrum?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:18:16
Thank you for everything you've said so far


What does this mean?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:47:13
Ah. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:39:13
This is with regards to exchanging one coin for another coin, right? What if I'm just making a purchase with bitcoin, can the money also be stolen there? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:57:12
There's like a 3.5% fee so the more you buy the higher the fee
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:48:50
It also says "Support all kinds of DApp development, including zero knowledge proof (included in the plan), cross-chain atomic transactions"
Does Btc support cross chain atomic transactions? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:01:15
They're done in cash though right? Like he'll just give me the market value of however much bitcoin I bought in cash 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:16:30
Also why is it that mining machines will become dirt cheap? Access to like solar panels? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:25:30
Got it. Thanks. I don't plan to invest in BTC cash anytime soon. BTC, Lite and Eth for me. I plan to invest next week.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:01:33


What's "sweep your key" "next time use RBF"?
I'm waiting for verification to go through and then I'm gonna invest. What do these mean so I don't have these issues?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:58:17
What influences the speed bitcoins are deposited into an account?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:42:30
I see. So how does that make my bitcoin cash have any validity?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:54:24
What is a short? Could you gimme an eli5 on a future? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:59:20
Haha just getting confirmation I apologise. I'm new to bitcoin (not new but I want to invest in cryptocurrency just waiting till I get paid). Thank you very much for all the information so far.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:10:33
Got it. Coinbase or Gemini?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:52:00
Why is this probable? Isn't it that the more people that mine makes it more expensive?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:09:02
Nah I watched it, read some things and educated myself on it but I'm very new to bitcoin so I assume others would know more
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:20:20
Where do the signatures go in segwit blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:24:11
Nope the money just goes back to whoever started the transaction
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:04:35
Holy shit okay. Does the change in difficulty mean that a computer requires more hash power to solve a problem to get bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:27:09
He didn't buy bitcoin in 2010 LOOOOOOOOOOL
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:36:15
Damn homie. Definitely look at the cheaper coins. Definitely easier to jump from $0.02 to $0.04. Have a look at these coins or watch a video by Ian Balina. He looks at cryptocurrency crowdsales.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:46:38
Not when the coin has a good idea behind it and a community behind it. Shitcoins won't go far but some valuable coins could.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:53:01
lol I'm not saying throw the whole $25000 into it (lol don't throw $25000 credit in anything pls) throw a bit. Definitely do research on some of these tho they're really good
