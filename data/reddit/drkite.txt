Okay, so not exactly. More along the terms of freeing people from powerful corporations

I hope you see this when you return, but thanks for doing all this anyway.

That article seems to be referring to the FCC v. Verizon case, in which the FCC lost. Verizon claimed that the FCC was trying to apply the rules of common carriers to Internet Service Providers, even though they technically are not common carriers. What this post is meant to do is to help encourage the reclassification of ISPs to common carriers which would result in net neutrality.

Shouldn't a reclassification save the internet and net neutrality?

Could you elaborate further? I may be mistaken, but I understood it to mean that internet service providers would be required to give the same amount of bandwidth to all sites, not just the ones that pay them. Imagine if paypal were to pay an ISP to allow users to have faster access to their site, rather than a bitcoin exchange.

I don't think it's giving power to the government, but instead convincing the already powerful government to use their power to help us.

Pretty much

Again, I may be mistaken, but this is how I understand it:
On January 14, 3 judges decided that the FCC could not apply common carrier regulations (The ones preventing them from engaging in individualized bargaining), on the grounds that Internet Service Providers (Verizon in this case) were not classified as Title II common carriers under the 1996 Telecommunications act, and my post tells people to ask the FCC to reclassify ISPs as common carriers, requiring them to provide equal access to all sites, not just the corporations that can afford to pay for it.
As I said before, I may be wrong, so correct me so I don't do the wrong thing. Also, is [this the post you were talking about?](

In a free unregulated market, yes it would be their right. However, in the United States (I am not sure where you are located), it is not a free unregulated market, and that is not entirely bad. Laws put in place to prevent monopolies creates an economic competition, which, when not abused by companies who simply want money, leads to innovation.

This is one of the best solutions that I have heard of. Unfortunately the FCC is needed to take care of other things, but the breaking up of larger providers, would be great for the internet and the economy.
