Imagine if all the whales were versions of this dude. People would be begging for a return to fiat if BTC ever became useful. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 17:06:05
If a point is valid how does it lose credibility for an unrelated error? Must he be perfect at all times for his valid points not to suddenly become invalid?
I like how you basically insulted OP's common poor word selection, and then went on a weird, run-on rant using a bunch of crypto buzz words. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 19:54:59
Didn't watch video but my guess is the guy pictured was leading a really honest life before he got into crypto.

Business owner would probably be better off putting a second gum display or bottled water cooler there. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 17:08:12
Can you explain this iceberg metaphor? Because as far as I can tell, the tip of the iceberg is barely what BTC has accomplished regarding mass adoption. That means barely the tip is in the background. The actual change that realistically effects the world is the other 99+% of work that needs to materialize. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 19:36:17
So retards think BTC is a scam and morons know the dollar is a scam.
Ok.

This is very great to see thank you for posting BTC should bull immediately

But now we have the internet, and said idiot can take her idiotic past and covert it to paragraph form and attach ads to it. Then the idiot can buy food and shelter and maybe keep itself presentable enough to become impregnated. Then with her next paragraph she can feed that idiot baby.

You know what would make crypto crash? Internet crash. 
You know what would make internet crash?
WWIII. 
You know what would start WWIII?
Fiat crashing. 
Be careful what you wish for. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:51:36
Doesn't matter because we will be in WWIII most people won't have a signal to reach their precious cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:54:29
Not much if bitcoin has one of its typical plunges. Oh yeah don't forget repeated transaction fees. OP is a dipshit. I've never attained or gotten rid of BTC without a fee. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:54:36
Oh wow guys look, the rapper who never misses an opportunity to refer to the most recent fad is referring to a recent fad. PROFITS AHEAD

Then just continue saving and buy the remaining 9% at a slightly higher price. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:42:23
I don't understand why the cap on BTC produced matters. There could be one bitcoin available, and we could divide that into 21 million pieces. Then we could divide each of those into 21 million more pieces. How is that different than inflation?
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:51:34
Oh cool some store in Ukraine shows the price of BTC. Adoption is really picking up
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:47:32
Yeah that's what I was thinking. Today is a convenient time to go back one year.

Got it. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:16:31
It is the issue buddy. You are upset about something you don't understand. 
What makes you think that anyone can just peer into your account on a whim? Even if they could, are you 100% invested in crypto with zero other assets?
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:35:08
Sure. Let's just keep converting all of our usable currency into something that we don't have any frame of reference towards. USD value of BTC is $1 per BTC? Keep buying folks, because who cares about relative value. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:20:22
Well this is a clear indication that bitcoin will succeed!! Right?? Right????

Posts like yours make me want to lose faith in BTC
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:51:16
Ok nice argument
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:52:07
I buy $100, coinbase charges me $1. I buy $200, coinbase charges me $1. Why do people say this is too much? What am I missing? Free robinhood trading?
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:43:45
Got it. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:18:39
OP is a troll and/and retarded
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:48:03
And what about those US states that accept bitcoin for tax season?
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:33:37
If my quick read is correct, then your argument is shit. You're saying global warming is inevitable, so why worry about any additional warming effects?

Lol down 28% since January, after like 1900% one year gains and a dip from ATH of about -66%. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:05:53
Good idea
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:33:05
Lol I thought black market and money laundering was ideal for BTC. 
Also how often do we hear of scams and frauds taking place in crypto, or to be careful how you proceed? Most big frauds and manipulation take time to surface.
Edit: after I posted this, the next story on my feed was "over 1 billion USD in bitcoin stolen this year"
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:37:22
You're more or less describing the benefits of cryptocurrency. Why do you think you've unlocked some new secret just by applying the fundamentals to art deals?
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:14:42
And here you are giving away more personal information that should stay private
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:37:25
Ur so smart
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:40:36
So let's say this gang infused $1.24 billion into BTC. What effect would that have on the price of BTC? If they did this over a long period of time and started cleaning, let's say, at $1,000 value...what would their infusion of money have on increasing the value of BTC that everyone else was buying into?
In other words, the public would see the price rising due to the gang's infusion and then the public gains confidence and buys in. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:25:39
Terrible video

So then why are people educated in sensible things more deserved to speak on this nonsensical topic?

This is nice. All numerics are sandwich between the same sign.

Depends on how many BTC are in his wallet little buddy. If he is running for office, he needs votes. If he is promoting one side of the story in order to favor another side of the story, then the voter is misguided.
Sure, maybe he is truly a prophet for good while also preaching for profit. But what is more likely in a scenario where his BTC wallet count is very high relative to your average holder?
@_date: 2018-07-15 17:26:53
I guess accumulating BTC never gets mentioned
@_date: 2018-07-13 16:38:09
Hope you're joking 
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:25:19
Did you read the initial post?
@_date: 2018-07-29 14:23:39
I guess you're the kid that used to tell your third grade teacher that you actually got question six wrong and deserve a B- instead of a B. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:21:36
Who the fuck is getting hacked? Most likely scenario is someone shipped it to his account via typo, unlikely but possible. Another possibility is that a transaction was mishandled somewhere in the software and rerouted the order. Likely but worrisome to the degree that the software isn't running 100% perfect. 
Where are you getting the idea that bank accounts are being hacked? Who cares what amount of money is in your account? Why do you have such a high degree of alarm in your long ass response?
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:31:37
You're just drawing things?
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:23:39
So he either gets $7900 delivered to his account, or whoever initiated the action tells coinbase, they void the 1 BTC and void the $100 transaction fee. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:28:14
As well as "how does this single sketchy ATM stuck in between furniture at some restaurant in Prague further mass adoption?"
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:27:55
Yeah pretty sure it's about $100. Not sure what he means by 'I was pretty sure it evened out'
@_date: 2018-07-22 00:24:55
Yeah I'm not attacking his personal finances I'm wondering his agenda. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 00:49:01
I don't know what you think is a contradiction. We are right back where we started because what you said is irrelevant. Just look into the concept of "conflict of interest" and you might be able to put two and two together.
