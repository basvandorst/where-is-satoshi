If you haven't heard the piece where Joe talks about the kid in the zoo who hassled a tiger in the zoo and then the tiger jumped out and killed him - it's classic.  Not the smartest guy in the world, but very funny.

it's still the wild wild west with this - but it is the Amazon killer and I wouldn't bet against it.  People are going to start getting their identities authenticated and it will result in two separate blockchain universes.  One will be the bizarro world - you decide which one.

They should list their alliances strategy for this

Settlement times should improve dramatically - soon.  In a model of non-repudiation, it should be a lot faster.  Private blockchains will always be faster - but every dog has fleas - as the expression goes.

It's going to be a bigger deal than the fork yesterday.  there will be the authenticated and the un-authenticated.  It's not like it will be the dark side and the jedi - but the two worlds will seldom overlap.

Yes - BTC will replace credit cards and because of the non-repudiation element - the fees should ultimately be much lower.

They can - it's just another step to make sure it's really them - same thing Twitter does - basically.

I often post on a few subs because they don't all seem to be the same people and get different comments.  In this particular case, the point about authentication is not unique to one blockchain - it gets more to the core about the role of identity authentication in any blockchain.

They just require an additional step 
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:23:24
They are doing more what UPort is doing, right?  See the chart in this post - this is how we understand the identity space and who is doing what.

Thank you very much for your comment.  IDs don't belong in a lot of places - but there are a bunch of use cases that require it (like bank transactions) and some people will want it in peer-to-peer interactions like hiring a babysitter or buying a boat from a site like Craigslist.  The thing that we are seeing is that once the identity is authenticated - that we know trader94 is the person in their driver license - the name on the driver's license doesn't have to be shared in most use cases - all the person needs to know is that the identity has been authenticated by a trusted source and that the person (through a smart contract) meets whatever their requirement is, be it an age minimum (babysitter maybe) or no criminal history or bad credit (could be the boat buying example).  Things like this can always be a slippery slope, but if done right, this should be a good thing for the blockchain.

Just giving people an option - not making anyone do anything.  Seems inevitable and necessary to get healthcare and financial services involved in all of this.

Will be interesting to watch this month

"Enslaved" seems a bit dramatic for what we are talking about.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:29:47
I think they are drawing attention to a key area that people like KnowYourCustomer and AuthenticID will take to the next level (with or without UPort)
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:48:48
Yep.  There's a thing coming soon from AuthenticID called IDX and sort of like Twitter you can call yourself anything you want - from Rumplestiltskin to cryptohoney.  Just not realDonaldTrump - actual celebrity names can't be used.  I am sure you are heartbroken.

Why do you think it's doomed?  There are already companies like Snip using it to authenticate people who register for their ICO. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:21:05
Not for long

One of the problems with blockchain today is that there is this enormous spectrum of how much people understand about all of the pieces of cryptocurrency.  So an article like this is going to be painfully obvious to some people and very helpful to others.  I am working with an investment banker on the AuthenticID ICO and he said he needs something really clear like this to take to his investors.  So I did it and posted the blog.

There's on chain and off chain.  Facebook would be off chain because it's not part of a blockchain, and on chain is within a given blockchain.  Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is "mined", or derived from a blockchain.

Looking for feedback on this table about trust
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:37:49
Trust and confidence need to go up for this to work.
