You must have gotten some very very bad information.
A 2MB upgrade has been studied extensively for over a year and is totally safe.  Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream and core dev) recommended forking to 2 MB then 4 MB then 8 MB back in August of 2015.
@_date: 2016-01-29 16:21:14
Bitcoin is changed constantly.  Every release by core represents a change.  Soft forks are changes, hard forks are changes.
Inaction can also represent a big change.  The 1 MB block size was nothing more than a filter for DOS attacks until recently.  Now that we're actually approaching that limit with standard transactions, the cap is performing an entirely new function.  Some people think we shouldn't radically change bitcoin like this without consensus.  
@_date: 2016-01-31 01:07:08
Adam's quote and current stance show that you're spreading BS.  It shows that a HF to 2 MB is safe and fine and that the opposition to it by core devs is simply because they prefer SegWit first.  
In other words, you're creating a false dichotomy.  You actually disagree with Adam Back and the vast majority of core devs who think a 2 MB is safe and fine, they just think it should come later.  Other people, like me, want it sooner.  Your argument that a 2MB HF is unsafe or terrible or something is just bull.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:58:08
No, the consensus of all of the top developers.  
For example, here was Adam Back introducing his 2-4-8 proposal in August saying, "2 MB now".  
The vast majority of experts, both core devs and otherwise, all say that an upgrade to 2MB is safe.  Those who currently oppose an immediate HF to 2 MB (including Adam Back) say it's simply preferable to roll out SegWit first and then to HF to 2 MB after.
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:54:01
That's all true and indisputed...and has nothing to do with what I wrote.  We *all want* the SegWit improvements *but they're not ready.*  The 2MB hard fork (kludges included) is ready.  Hard forking to 2 MB would not meaningfully delay SegWit.
@_date: 2016-01-29 16:10:46
A lot of people *correctly* say they value the opinions of experts over that of random redditors.  True!  But there's more than one type of expert.
Technical experts best understand the code and the technological ramifications of various potential changes.
Commercial experts best understand how users derive value from bitcoin and the economic ramifications of potential changes.
We need to listen to both.  That means we should listen to the arguments of both core developers, as well as people who run commercial bitcoin enterprises.
@_date: 2016-01-31 00:33:40
You don't understand that Gavin's quotes could just as easily refer to the lightning network?  Blockstream is also saying that the majority of bitcoin transactions will no longer be secured by PoW.
You're also falling for the simple logical fallacy of the false dichotomy.
We are not discussing an increase to 1 GB or even 8 MB block size.  We are discussing an increase to 2MB, which Adam Back and the vast majority of core devs support.  Again, the issue is just whether to do it now or in a year.
Yes, eventually we will have a fee network.  That was Satoshi's idea all along - that as the block reward falls, miners will get paid via transaction fees.  But we're still in beta, in the adoption/growth phase.  The block reward is still huge.
Hearn isn't even part of the bitcoin experiment anymore.  I could dig up quotes from some random core dev that sound horrible and use that to argue against all of bitcoin core's policies....but that would be stupid.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:35:37
In this case, failure to increase the block size represents a dramatic *change* to how bitcoin works.
Until now, the 1 MB cap was nothing but a spam filter, and that was why Satoshi put it in place in the first place.  It was never intended to be on a limit on *legitimate* transactions.  But now the # of legit transactions has steadily risen to be near the cap.  
If we want to *maintain* bitcoin functionality in a relatively unchanged state, we have to increase the block size.
@_date: 2016-01-31 00:12:19
The things I'm saying (my sense of reality) are tied directly to the facts: I'm listening to what all of bitcoin's economic players are actually saying.  I'm reading the tweets by miners and exchange operators about how they support a 2MB upgrade, and reading posts by full node operators about giving up on their 2MB upgrades after getting DOS'ed, etc.  
"The market has spoken" is nonsensical in this context.  The market *fears* the core developers who've said they'll destroy the mining community via a PoW change in response to a 2MB HF.  The market fears that core devs will actively undermine bitcoin's success by championing the losing fork.  The market fears the instability that the core devs are threatening.  Basically, the market is speaking, and saying that the core dev terrorism is too dangerous to risk at the moment.
@_date: 2016-01-29 17:12:05
You know bitcoin has been changed many times before right?  Heck, it's even hard forked before.  
But big changes can and have been made to bitcoin via other methods.  Sometimes, the exact same change can be made via both soft fork and hard fork (as is being debated by SegWit).  None of these changes are a "new currency."  They're simply upgrades to the existing bitcoin blockchain.  It's also worth remembering that bitcoin isn't just a currency, it's also a technology.  And like all technologies, it has to continue being upgraded or it will quickly become obsolete and die.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:43:45
Jesus, how have you not figured this out yet after it's been explained to you a dozen times.
The concern is not *current* fees and *current* congestion. The concern is that we see transaction volume rising somewhat steadily, and gradually approaching the 1 MB cap.  Our concern is in the *near future* when people want to conduct more transactions than can fit in that 1 MB, and before LN has been released.  Stop pointing to current fees as a meaningful metric of anything when they're obviously not.
Some of us would rather upgrade the infrastructure *before* we have an easily foreseen crisis.
@_date: 2016-01-31 00:50:04
Lol.  You like quoting Gavin but don't like seeing Adam Back quotes...the cognitive dissonance is hilarious.  I'll post it one more time.  Here's your god Adam Back saying he wants a HF to 2 MB "now" back in August of 2015.   
Unlike you, I don't believe in centralized leadership.  Unlike you, I don't want a bitcoin ruling party.  When I support bitcoin classic, I'm not supporting Gavin.  I'm supporting a specific open source implementation that anyone can edit going forward.  No one is talking about replacing one programmer with another.  We're talking about adopting one specific proposal via bitcoin classic that the core devs are refusing to give us.  Bitcoin doesn't have political parties.   I don't have to voice allegiance to Gavin or Toomin.  I can pick one policy from Gavin and SegWit from Adam.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:30:30
"immediate, rash"  What on earth have you been smoking?
The increase in block size has been discussed and studied ad nauseum for at least a year now.  Heck, back in August, the CEO of Blockstream, Adam Back, suggested his 2-4-8 plan.
Why on earth would you want to wait until a forseeable crisis occurs to make the simple and easy changes necessary to upgrade the infrastructure?  Imagine if a company was doubling its user base every year and the CTO suggests buying more servers.  The CEO says, "but we're only at 90% capacity utilization of the existing servers.  Why upgrade before the thing starts crashing?"  
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:50:51
You're confusing support for actions, an easy mistake to make.  A lot of node operators have said they want to upgrade to 2 MB but fear that they'll get DDOS'ed again like the ones who upgraded to XT were.
Exchanges and miners aren't "acting on their promises" because they want to avoid precipitating a schism in the community and a potentially harmful hard fork. They are hoping core devs come to their senses and are willing to compromise just a little.  So they're tweeting and releasing public statements about how they want a 2MB hard fork, rather than upgrading prematurely.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:46:56
No one cares about current fees or fees in 2013.  We care about the *near future* when congestion may increase massively as transaction volume continues growing.
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:39:54
It's probably Nick Szabo
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:32:51
No, you have it reversed.  A 2MB upgrade is easy and ready.  The only other thing the upgrade required was a limit on individual transaction size to 100 kb, and that's already been coded by Gavin.
In contrast, SegWit won't be ready for adoption until April probably.
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:48:31
Except that the topic at hand (the 1 MB cap) wasn't ever intended as a "right" at all, it was an accidental and arbitrary cap purely to prevent DOS attacks.  It was intended to be *far* above the number of real transactions occurring.  If anything, Adam is supporting the *revocation* of bitcoiners' natural rights to transact without block caps.  Failing to increase the cap constitutes a massive *change* in how bitcoin functions.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:38:01
You've got it backwards.  The majority of miners, node operators, big bitcoin company operators, and users all want a HF to 2 MB.  They've lost (so far) because 1. node operators got DDOS'ed when they upgraded, 2. Miners have publicly said they want a 2 MB HF but fear chasing a contentious hard fork not released by the core developers, because some core devs have said they would pursue scorched earth tactics to destroy the mining community via a PoW change.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:41:53
This is a ridiculous false dichotomy.  How about I frame it as: stagnant bitcoin with an obsolete and arbitrary cap on transactions vs upgraded bitcoin that has been scaled in line with its growing user base?
Pretending that an upgrade to 2MB has anything to do with centralization is nonsense.  Adam Back was the one who suggested 2-4-8 MB HF upgrades back in August.
@_date: 2016-01-29 20:01:54
But a trivial amount.  A lot of blockchain services only need 0.00001 BTC to work.  So no meaningful impact on rarity.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:44:53
The Core Devs (Adam Back of blockstream) introduced the 2-4-8 MB scaling plan back in August.  Stop making this classic vs core.  It's not.  BOTH groups want bigger blocks by hardfork, it's just a question of a relatively small difference in timing.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:33:58
Why should we care about precluding the need for the "kludge"?  the kludge is totally harmless and has already been coded.  
Everyone wants SegWit.  But SegWit isn't ready yet.  A 2 MB upgrade is ready and easy and safe.   Then we'll do SegWit when it's ready.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:46:17
Found the guy who doesn't understand exchanges rates, lol.
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:52:09
Depends on how the value is derived.  If people start using the blockchain to pass love letters, it's not clear to me that this increases the price per BTC.
@_date: 2016-01-29 17:39:36
Agreed.  Better to call it "maintenance" or something.  But sometimes maintenance is necessary.
A minor innovation would be to have the blocksize dynamically follow average volume.
@_date: 2016-01-31 00:23:02
You're missing a few points.  
1. Basic scaling is a simple necessity for most technologies and businesses.  If you want a network to be able to handle increasing traffic, you have to upgrade your infrastructure.  For bitcoin, this can be done ad hoc (e.g. hard fork when needed), or we can make the change just once to a dynamic system that automatically calculates a new block size cap every 1000 blocks or something tied to average volume.  Code for this has already been written, it's not that complicated.
2.  The cost of hardware is continuously falling.  The cost of supporting a full node that can handle 1 MB blocks is much lower today than it was 5 years ago.  Same with the cost for supporting 2 MB and 4 MB etc.  So if you simply wanted consistency in cost of running a full node, you'd have to upgrade block size cap every so often.
3. Numerous other changes are in the works that will reduce the cost of running a full node.  SegWit is one example.  
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:42:46
This is false.  Adam Back himself proposed the 2-4-8 roadmap last August.  The only question was sequence.  Rolling out the 2MB now has almost no impact on SegWit (which isn't expected to roll out until April).
So *everyone* wants 2 MB and *everyone* wants SegWit.  The only question is sequence. Both have equal support (everyone), and *the majority* wants 2MB first.
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:44:44
No one is talking about delaying SegWit.  Segwit simply isn't ready yet and won't be ready until April according to its developers.  The 2 MB hardfork is ready now.  
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:36:37
SegWit isn't ready.  We're hoping it will be ready in April.  The vast majority of the community thinks that it makes sense to increase the blocksize *before* that cap creates new problems.
@_date: 2016-01-29 16:50:28
Every time Core releases a new version, they're making changes.  Soft forks are changes, hard forks are changes.  It's all changes to how bitcoin operates.  
Inaction can also represent a big change.  The 1 MB block size was nothing more than a filter for DOS attacks until recently.  Now that we're actually approaching that limit with standard transactions, the cap is performing an entirely new function.  Should we require overwhelming consensus for *that?*
It's also worth noting that inaction will ultimately doom a new technology to *certain* death.  Since other FinTech will continue evolving and making use of new technological innovations and improvements, a stagnant technology will become obsolete and die.  This isn't a hypothetical, it's a complete certainty.
@_date: 2016-01-31 00:09:43
The vast majority of people who understand the economic system, and many technical developers support doing it now. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 17:23:50
good reasons = wanting higher bitcoin fees to facilitate faster adoption of LN when its released in 9 months.
@_date: 2016-02-08 17:09:36
Code to increase the blocksize is more than 2 years old.  It's also much, much simpler.
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:58:13
Correct, it's just about timing.  Do we want to throttle bitcoin and induce higher transaction fees while we wait for the lightning network, or...do we want to scale bitcoin with the only tool immediately available while we wait for LN?  Obviously those who stand to profit from LN prefer the former so that LN gets wider adoption upon its release.  The rest of us want to increase blocksize *before* it creates major problems.
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:48:14
This is incorrect.  The 1 MB limit was set to be massively above the prevailing transaction volume at the time.  The idea was it would in no way impact transactions at all, but would serve to prevent DOS attacks.
To maintain a blocksize limit to prevent exploits in the same way today, we would have to raise the cap to more than 20 MB.
