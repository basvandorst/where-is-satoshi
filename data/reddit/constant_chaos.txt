So are you saying the bitcoin exchanges are 100% free?  If I take $10,000 in Bitcoin transactions in a month I will keep 100% of that?

Because not everyone prioritizes the anonymity aspect.

Nope.  Definitely will not.  But the banks are trying to snag patents based on the innovations brought to the table by bitcoin.  I don't think they care about its success and are probably actively working against it.

There will be a killer app,  and it will come from one or many of the big banks as they adopt the parts of the bitcoin model that they can twist to serve their business model.  They've already tried patenting parts of it.

But it's value is completely unstable and if someone rips you off it's pretty much impossible to seek relief.  This means risk.  Business owners don't like risk.  How do you explain away the risk?

They probably debated adding a btc fee to help cushion them from the wild day to day swings of btc value.

Yes...  I agree.  Let's all stop watching this downward spiral.  If you watch,  you may be too tempted to pull your money out and that will further degrade the cash value of my bitcoins.  I can't have you people further wrecking my value here.

They're under no obligation to charge him with everything at once. They can charge him with the murder for hire scheme after they're done raking him over the coals for the current charges. Are you sure have no evidence?  That's a pretty tall statement coming from an outside spectator.
