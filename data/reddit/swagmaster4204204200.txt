Unfortunately I do no drugs except for adderall as I have a demanding job in the financial sector. My username is purely ironic.
Nobody here is debating whether bitcoin is a pump and dump so I'll assume I'm correct and you are just sad. Sorry!

I agree. Darkleaks sounds like a 19 year old's idea

That's a lot of projecting, I'm deeply hurt by your accusations
Don't be mad that you fell for a pump and dump. Just cut your losses

It was indeed already done and without such an edgy name.

Echo chamber.

Bitcoiners don't care about their ideology they just want them to pump and dump it

**Bitcoin Capital Gains Category Canada**
What category does bitcoin fit into?
These are the options that are available:
Right now I am thinking it's number 4.
If you don't want to click here are the options in text format:
3.Publicly traded shares, mutual fund units, deferral of eligible small business corporation shares, and other shares
4.Real estate, depreciable property, and other properties
5.Bonds, debentures, promissory notes, and other similar properties
6.Other mortgage foreclosures and conditional sales repossessions
7.Personal-use property
8.Listed personal property (LPP)
I have googled for an hour and can't find anything about the category of capital gains tax for bitcoin, any help would be appreciated.
