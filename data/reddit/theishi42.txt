RBF is really really bad, and he explains the problems with it pretty well. I didn't see anything in that portion about 'his tactics', whatever that means.
edit: Hmm I got downvoted by a bot. Interesting.

You seem to misunderstand how this works. The transaction will take hours to work, but ultimately it will go through. Miners will not process the double spend simply because the fee is higher, it is against their interest. As long as the miners see the first transaction first, it will be the one that goes through. Perhaps this may be a problem when we reach the block limit, which is why I support higher block sizes, but at the moment it isn't. It is funny that we can't talk about xBTC here, but RBF is fine. Not sure how RBF doesn't make the protocol an altcoin, but higher block sizes does.
edit: I am testing this now, for shits and giggles

The only way that my method would be successful today (without RBF) is with transaction malleability. Without that, then both transactions will go through. There is nothing wrong with relying on 0confs, why you would want to remove that is beyond me.

Basically RBF makes double spends trivial. I can send money to myself then immediately afterwards send money to the coffee shop. Once I use RBF on the first transaction, the second one becomes void. I could see people releasing apks of bitcoin wallets that do this automatically for you. Zero Confirmations were never a problem for small transactions.

Its kinda annoying they interviewed an idiot. The guy doesn't seem to understand what he is talking about. He claims bitcoin is less transparent

Can't we do RBFs already with the existing architecture? If send money to someone without a fee, and then notice it is not getting taken up. Couldn't I, wallet permitting, resend the transaction with a higher fee? Obviously it would be up to the miners to accept it, but I don't see why we need to change bitcoin to implement something that we can already do.

I think the idea would be the people can use it, but they control issueibg currency and who opens accounts. I'm interested in watching the hackers tear it apart

Didn't consider that

That plan seems to be working great with file sharing

A better question would be: what's the likelihood Shkreli believes it is Satoshi?

Can you link to these screenshots?
