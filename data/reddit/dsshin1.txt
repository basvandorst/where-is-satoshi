Integrating into CPU design is more costly (in terms of performance) than benefits.  This would create more delay and cause performance degradation due to the complexity in ISSUE/MEM process.  
The architecture would improve the most, if following improvements were made in addendum to the current design:
* More SHA Units (easiest to achieve, Copy &amp; Paste)
* Enough BUS to sustain bandwidth (this is tough due to Routing)
* Fine tuned PLL/DLL (this requires better process = COST)
* Large CAM to hold the instructions. (not bad, to be honest, but SRAM will reduce chip yield)
Very little from the GPU/CPU design can actually benefit from this.
Except for the PLL/DLL aspect.
This ASIC unit is closer to Memory (PCRAM with RPMB or eMMC) than GPU/CPU.

GPU/Chip design process is rather simple, due to the simplicity of the SHA.  But once they go into silicon, that's more of a job for TSMC rather than AMD. 
Creating a "MASK" (ASIC chip print layer) is costly business.  I'm sure the SHA can be done using cheap process with only 3 metal layers, and you could save cost if you use 90nm process.  
* But unless people buy volumes of it like GPU over period of multiple years, it is not profitable.
tl;dr: AMD is wrong person to ask.  Get an open source design -&gt; then Contact TSMC for custom foundry or use academic plot.  (this alternative is still crazy expensive)
edit:  OR you could buy FPGA like Altera Statix V and just create the SHA chip.  Then create PCB design and profit (this is what people are doing now)

Well... if the Wu Tang Financial(tm) supports it...

This is misleading, because you are comparing the total market capital of the Bitcoin with AMD's revenue.
You have to only take account of the revenue from the newly created bitcoins, and then modify by the other factors such as competitors / limited resources / ...

Extensions such as MMX within CPU will improve SHA performance.
But since mining mostly requires that Extension alone, why bother with the rest of the CPU?
It's (most likely) better to have an Application Specific IC rather than appending huge array of SHA units appended onto the CPU.
I say most likely, because CPUs already have great PLL/DLL and most importantly tech process (sub-40nm with tri-gate)  that could improve the SHA portion.

In Logic, A &amp; A = A.  So, 
R &amp; D &amp; D 
= R &amp; (D &amp; D) // by commutative property
= R &amp; D  // since D&amp;D=D
= Research and Development.
