Nobody is asking the right questions. The main argument behind the security of Bitcoin is that of every bit of spent electricity being in proportion with the security. That seeing as the energy is an expense swapped for petahashes of computational power, no single nation state, country or Advanced Persistent Threat can deploy even a dent in the consensus. Should one have that amount of power, it would be vastly more profitable to employ said power in the mining process in exchange for crypto currency. 
Is Bitcoin spending a vast amount of energy or is it not? I seems more possible that the US govt could mount an attack on the consensus if that amount of energy is within reach of their own infrastructural capability. How expensive is said attack? The US govt aren't interested in earning bitcoins... they likely want to destroy the network.

I don't think Satoshi came up with that word. Bitcoin is a digital simulation of gold, hence the mining process.

Serious stuff is happening from my POV. Whereas Tron is dealing with fake volume accusations and the overall madness of Justin Sun... EOS is this: [

I believe it was made for the  contest they currently have ongoing in the community. I personally don't get all the hate against EOS and I think most are rather misinformed, but hey, I'm biased.

Bless you! so the [uint256.h]( file on github implements this in almost 160 lines of code!?!? What?
