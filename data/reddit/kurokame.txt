SS isn't a ponzi scheme because you aren't entitled to any returns for what you put into it. Pensions do have a liability to pay out.
Bitcoin is something different, and to the uninformed who use old models to understand it, it comes across as a "horseless carriage." FWIW, I'm over 40 as well.

I simply mean that anyone that puts funds into SS is by definition not an investor, in the sense that they own a stake in any of the returns. Remember, as a government retirement scheme based on taxes, by definition there's no "growth" to use as a payback mechanism. Every attempt to move SS to an investment style model has been defeated.

The wallet is not compromised by use, it's that it doesn't have a change address for the remaining coins. You can't spend a partial amount and have any coins remaining at the paper wallet address because all coins are always used in every transaction. This is why you have to sweep the wallet into an actual client prior to use. A hardware wallet avoids this.

I'm assuming you're trying to make a pithy comment but I'm not sure what you mean. In WWI the Germans attacked through Belgium and they did the same thing in WWII. The Maginot Line as a continuous fortification ended prior to the Belgium border because the whole point was to push the Germans into Belgium again. The problem was that the Ardennes forest was considered a natural barrier to bridge the gap between the continuous line and the fortified positions on the other side of the forest, yet this is where the Germans put their point of main effort. 
I think you misunderstood what the French were trying to accomplish in your example.

$10,000 worth of btc would get you less than two full bitcoins at today's price. If the price went up to $500,000 a coin you still couldn't retire on that full coin and a bit or leverage it as an investment, so I don't see how that correlates to "winning everything".

Any gold you would have in monetary form would not be worth its face value and would be unspendable for that exact reason for everyday purposes.

Your BCC is attached to the same pre-fork private key you used for your BTC. Once the chains split you will move your BTC to a new wallet and new private key on the main blockchain, while your new BCC will remain at the old private key on the BCC blockchain. You will see your BCC balance when you load your old private key into the BCC wallet.
As of right now, which is pre-fork, you don't a wallet with BCC support, only if you plan on using your BCC after Aug. 1st.

* Move your btc from blockchain to a local wallet such as Electrum
* Install Electron Cash on a machine that does not have your Electrum wallets
* Wait until the BCC hard fork has taken place, and a few BCC blocks have been mined.
* Move all your Electrum funds to a new Electrum wallet. This will move only your BTC, and not your BCC, because the BCC blockchain has replay protection. Wait until the transaction is confirmed.
* Enter the seed of your (now empty) old wallet or private keys in Electron
Cash. Since the BTC have been moved to a new wallet, entering your old seed in
Electron Cash will not put your BTC funds at risk.

Serious but possibly dumb question.. If a certain group is so butt hurt over how to modify the bitcoin protocol, whether it be BU, segwit or other scaling solution, why not just move over to litecoin, which has already started implementing these changes?
Full discIosure, I don't hold any litecoin, just curious why this never comes up as a solution.
