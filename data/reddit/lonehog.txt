Seems to me that UK is full of bitcoin ATM
@_date: 2014-07-10 05:13:28
Africa should be happy that they even have a chance to transfer money with such a low costs
@_date: 2014-07-10 05:45:25
I literally see no reasons why BTC addresses need to go
@_date: 2014-07-03 05:14:38
They were not rejected before. Just "very clever" headline makers made another stupid headline!

Now we are waiting for Google which accepts Bitcoin...

if only paypal tightened up the rules to not allow scammers to grab their FIAT back from victims, then bitcoin will be abused. we do not need paypal, we need a better, bug free alternative 'auction site'. yes i already know a few bitoin auction sites exist, my emphasis was on the 'better' and 'bug free' part
@_date: 2014-07-03 05:06:41
I thought thay banned bitcoin for months ago
@_date: 2014-07-10 05:47:54
Lol. All you care is your privacy

What is so fantastic in the news that you are that happy?

You made this topic meanless. Thx you man! 
@_date: 2014-02-15 06:57:07
Don't believe this. All the more it's mtgox - they cause only bad things and there're a lot of people who've lost their money thank to MtGox
@_date: 2014-07-10 05:56:56
We don't need to buy bitcoins. It's for speculators.
We need to mine it until your arms fall off, till your abs get hard and your bone’s all soft

I asked a lot of sytes to eccept bitcoin. they just answered "Thanks for your response" and nothing has changed
@_date: 2014-07-10 05:13:28
Africa should be happy that they even have a chance to transfer money with such a low costs

Awesome! I have yet to experience my first bitcoin ATM. It's nice that this one did not make you privide Drivers License or scan fingerprints. It seems easy enough, although I see the 1 confirmation thing a pretty big turnoff for the mainstream. If people want their cash right away, they will not wait an average of 10 minutes.
The exchange rate seems reasonable enough. Was that 5% fee added on top of the displayed exchange rate?
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:43:24
Wow, that's a large number of ATM. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 06:44:52

They should accept BTC in public transport for helping you in traveling to the Bitcoin ATM

Pathetic marketing attempt at promoting digibyte as one of the top 4. That coin has no place with the other three. I just took a look at coin market cap. Digibyte is  shit coin barely in the top 100.

Twin mirrors?
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:53:58
charge back scammers -&gt; bad press -&gt; negative public perception that paypal/visa will insure fiat, but not bitcoin. -&gt; people wont want bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-05-04 17:45:32
Are here any germans? what is your opinion about the translation, sometimes it really sucks
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:38:52
Seriously? Don't send him a cent. He didn't do anything, just hold up a sign! No one will hear more about bitcoin if I donated 10btc.
@_date: 2014-07-10 05:15:44
Scams were about to kick your ass but you are tough too!
@_date: 2014-07-03 05:24:44

Despite I think that Bill Gates is one of the outstanding businessman I don't agree with his view on bitcoin, Bitcoin is going to capture not only poor countries but whole world.
