As far as I can tell so far there has been exactly zero bitcoin donations aside from me so I guess not.  Come on guys crack those wallets.  You get eggs.
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:50:52
Good work!  Organic ftw.
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:16:52
It's not my charities I'm just helping them use bitcoin to raise money. Do your own research and make your own decisions. I just get the shits that garbage gets visibility and good causes don't.
@_date: 2014-06-03 04:12:58
there's a pretty thriving bitcoin community in melbourne and I'd assume alot of them are on reddit.  sorry for the hassle though i hope i didn't waste too much of your ramchips.
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:14:54
Wow this is great I'll add it to the article!  
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:16:44
yeah it's been pretty amazing working on these conferences he's a truly engaging speaker, even when just talking about the mundane.
@_date: 2014-05-16 11:28:26
nice thanks!  Will pay it forward the next time someone does reddit good.
@_date: 2014-06-23 01:38:21

grumps green are back on board, change of owners so they had to figure it out.  Went round, set em up, had a beer and off on my way. 
Little mule have also changed owners and the new owner isn't too keen.  Probably more focussed on hand over so I'm just letting them chill for a while.
[Here's a mega list of places that take btc]( 
remove kodiak from that list and add beavers tail in melbourne.

If you choose your reward and donation level as normal , when it comes to payment type bitcoin should be an option (next to credit card/PayPal).  Let me know how you go.

now you're starting to sound like my mother.
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:48:08
It only occurred to me how hard kickstarter with bitcoin would rock and it fired me up to write this.  Stoked you donated.  I'll keep posting updates as we get closer to the target.
@_date: 2014-08-20 04:54:03
We put this together as a way to help merchants get the word out about their business and help people with bitcoin find good places to spend it.  All businesses are running 10% + discounts. 
[You can register your business here.](
@_date: 2014-11-25 09:05:05
no problem, [you can actually ask questions here as well](
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:34:23
CoinJar is a market maker so no.  Same goes for a merchant sale through CoinJar.

@_date: 2014-11-25 09:54:18
Hi sorry, I think we gave it the reddit hug. it's back up and we'll have recordings of melbourne and sydney up ASAP at 
@_date: 2014-11-25 09:52:23
hi we have a third party managing the stream so not sure.  However it is being recorded in it's entirety (and last nights) as well so follow us on twitter ( to get the melbourne and sydney feeds in their entirety.
I think we might have given it the old reddit hug.

@_date: 2014-08-04 23:02:44
Next time I'm in syd I'll be sure to throw some Btc round.  Might PM you for an updated list prior if that's ok.
@_date: 2014-08-18 22:35:22
I'm so used to waking up to reddit telling me to eat shit and die. this is basically the best morning I've had in months.  Thank you kind stranger (who I clearly know).
Edit: on a second read I think I can guess who it is.  &lt;3
@_date: 2015-05-28 22:21:04
Hi Sam from CoinJar here.
Sorry you had this experience, I know how cool it is showing a new person bitcoin. If you drop us a line at support we'll troubleshoot with you and get this resolved.
@_date: 2015-05-02 12:24:41
But the fiat/btc interchange is limited by geography. Btc is borderless but the markets it exists in aren't.
@_date: 2014-12-21 01:16:06
you the man, I'm not in the charities though, just raising money for them, so I'll forward this to EFA because they're losing heavily
@_date: 2014-08-18 22:38:13
Me too bro.  Wait till the bitcoin funded poetry slam.  I'm gonna put on a fake moustache over my real moustache and enter.
@_date: 2015-05-14 10:45:56
[had my bitcoin address on soundcloud for years]( and have had a few random donations. it'll be good to go spread the love. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 10:36:08
and half price if you pay with bitcoin?  Forget about it.  
@_date: 2015-05-11 04:15:43

b-but... curved sides
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:30:00
yeah it doesn't cost us much at all to cover the fee, and it's worth it to be able to guarantee the transaction priority for non-technical users.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:15:20
you wish pal
