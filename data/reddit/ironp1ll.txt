So nice of Venezuela to show us that socialism is a disaster. It is always easier, entertaining, and more profitable to learn from the mistakes of others.

Lemme ask you something.
Why does gasoline cost money? You can just "make" it, right? Why do we have to pay money for it? Isn't that messed up?
Well, if you could make it *easily*, that means you could sell it for less, and no one would bother paying ~$3 per gallon.
But that's not the case, gasoline is difficult to make, so it costs money to buy, or else no one would make it.
Same with bitcoin. If it could be easily made with software, why would we pay $6,000+ for it?
I'll tell you what, if you get this thing working, I will buy every single one of your bitcoins for $5,000. EVERY SINGLE ONE, because I'm a good guy. See you on Bisq! ��

Smug? Hell yes.
Naïve? No, I don't believe in socialism.

I have dug into that rabbit hole and fed notes 100% nail the prophecy. BTC is basically ambrosia.

This sounds retarded wut?

I don't like this. Phasing out cash removes fungibility, which is critical for a functional currency. The IMF is afraid of bitcoin, and wants to get ahead of it with "E-money."

A series of hashed IOU's kept between two parties that unlock a multisig address.
I might be wrong, I really winged that.

The only reason I hold btc, is the off chance that whatever happened in Venezuela happens here too. I don't want to starve to death. Is that "investing?"
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:56:50
It is stupid to give exact or even close to exact amount of btc you hold, especially when held by an untrustworthy third party.
Imagine that me or the government or some other attacker somehow got a hold of Coinbase's records. I could check every account with roughly that amount of money and try to link your Reddit history to it. Bonus points for getting Reddit's IP logs, that would save a lot of effort.
Next thing you know, some toughguys are doing the old rubber hose decryption on a friday night. You must have been out partying.
This post is the product of a paranoid drug user. Do not take it seriously.

If I owned a hospital I wouldn't give stitches to Bernie donors.
Still okay with it?

Doesn't matter, because you will, whether you like it or not. It is how you react to that which shows your character.

They are part of a technology cartel that is blacklisting certain actors from their services. Once you are deemed undesirable, you can't process credit cards, keep a domain registrar, appear on Google or have a youtube channel, etc etc.

Just checking to see if you are being logically consistent.

We don't need their propaganda. BTC will succeed on merit.

Yep, I only HODL a small amount in order to prevent literal starvation in the future. I can memorize my life savings and walk away.

It's more of a "stay rich after USD collapses" scheme.

If you can afford to lose the money, do it with no ragrets.

I keep hearing, "It's a volitaile asset!" 
Well, after a while, you accept that, maybe it's being jaded. But it stops holding weight, maybe USD is the volatile asset.

Yaaas! No one can touch my bitcoin. Not some bank, not the cops or the  courts, not the federal reserve. My wealth is untouchable and I can memorize it and flee the country if I need to. I can spend it or gift it and no one will be able to stop me.
USD has so many fucking rules, how much you can transfer, how much you can inherit, what you can buy with it.
FUCK THAT NOISE. Ain't nobody got time for it.
