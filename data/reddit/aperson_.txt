And it's merged :)

Wtf! I was at 3rd stage a week ago and sold everything for Bitcoin yesterday. Didn't even know this was a thing.
Glad I'm not alone :'D

Here: 
You can buy Ledger Hardware wallet with Bitcoins

Thanks for this. Needed coinome one.

Donation to Bitcoin Core community? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:08:24
Bitfinex require referral to sign up due to high demand. May I ask if you have one?
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:29:12
Mailed my local exchange about using Segwit and batch transactions. Got a reply saying it's in high priority list and is being worked on :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:43:19
Simple rule in bitcoin algorithm : The more you try to mine, the harder it gets.

Please refer this as to why we did not have SegWit2x :  Hint: "SegWit2x **backers** have decided to call off the fork."  


It's not about whether you agreed or not, it's about following the consensus to continue with Bitcoin network. Anyone is welcome to follow their own rules and have their own seperate blockchain, like Bitcoin Cash.


No one is stopping you from transacting with Bitcoin now. We have higher fees because people are willing to pay to prioritize their transaction, as they consider their transaction important and are not willing to wait. 
As to why a simple block size increase is not a proper solution, please refer this video :  .

I feel like all alts, except maybe Ethereum, are just for pump and dump. People get in at low price, hoping that someday those altcoins will become huge and will make them millionare since they missed the Bitcoin train. Any time an Alt goes up, everyone starts dumping to get their profits.
Atleast that's my experience so far. Feel free to correct me and maybe enlighten me with awesome tech being used by alts, while still staying peer to peer, decentralized, borderless and secure? :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:28:53
Instant transactions at close to zero fee.

Just for the record, I have nothing against BCH, and If you watched the video I linked, you would realize by increasing their blocksize, BCH became less decentralized. Please watch that video once.
And If 90% mining pools voted for Blocksize increase, which didn't happen, then why are they still running Bitcoin core? Why are they not on Bitcoin cash blockchain? 
I realize we are in a shitty situation right now because of huge adoption and demand. Lightning network was proposed 2 years ago and what happened in those 2 years? Well, they built the system. It's being tested and bugs are being fixed. These things take time. It's not easy building something which is handling people's money and is currently worth $300B.
Again, watch the video once. We'll have blocksize increase because lighting network requires it. It's not optional. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:51:27
Using Segwit effectively makes blocksize about 1.7MB.
Now, how many are actually using SegWit? Not even 30% participants. And there lies the problem. Just because SegWit was activated doesn't mean it has been adopted by everyone.
And ofcourse, once Lightning Network starts getting implemented on main Bitcoin Network, we'll have a hard Blocksize increase as promised my Core devs. Have patience. 
Until then, atleast make participants adopt Segwit, which would reduce transaction size, which leads to more transactions per blocks, and cheaper fees.

Thank you :) 
Even though I heard about Bitcoin in 2013, I couldn't join since I was just starting college and had nothing to invest. And I finished my college a few months ago and when Bitcoin broke 10k barrier, I knew its finally going to become something great and I got in since now I have money to buy some. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:04:28
I like him because he teaches things from an engineering point of view and unlike others doesn't care If Bitcoin is 10k today or 100k tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:02:27
I would gladly use Bitcoin If I could, but the country where I'm doesn't have much adoption yet. I knew about Bitcoin since 2013. The only reason I couldn't join in was because I was just starting my College and didn't have the luxury of buy bitcoins. I finished my college few months ago and when Bitcoin broke 10k, I knew it's really going to become huge in long term and got in.

How much fee did you pay for your withdrawal?
I guess anything less than 0.001BTC in fee is still in mempool waiting to get confirmed.
There are more than 150,000 unconfirmed transactions as of now. See here: 
I use coinome.com and made a withdrawal request today. They have a fixed fee of 0.001BTC and I got my first confirmation in 5min.
If you know your transaction Id, you can track it on blockchain.info

Electrum supports Segwit
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:09:49
Yes. I believe in Core development team and their way of doing things. They don't believe in quick and easy fix to please people out there. They have a long vision and don't want to repeat the mistakes of Internet when It was scaling.
If we really want to scale, we need the 2nd layer and not cram every small thing on the main Blockchain.
And look where we are because of them :)

If you have a PC which you don't mind running ~24/7 and you know how to keep it secure, then thats your hardware solution.
Otherwise just get a raspberry pi and an external Harddisk and you can run Bitcoin full node along with lightning, no problem. 
I don't know about RSK nodes, sorry.
Just make sure whatever hardware you use, make it secure. Don't let it become a part of botnets :D

Thank you for your awesome guide :D
I skipped swap as you mentioned swapping to harddrive is slow as fuck.
I have my ports open in firewall and they are forwarded in my router properly, and I'm still getting 8 peers max. Maybe they'll increase after my sync is complete? I've contacted my ISP about it and they told me to turn off my firewall :D
@_date: 2018-07-23 06:10:09
Nope, not pruning. It's a 1 TB external drive. (2nd photo)
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:43:06
That's unusual. Memory shouldn't be an issue since it would write to swap once it runs out and sync from there.
Are you sure your source code hasn't been tampered?
@_date: 2018-07-23 04:04:20
Raspberry pi 3b+ with raspbian lite.
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:15:17
Raspbian with an external hard disk attached.
@_date: 2018-07-23 11:15:05
Check this awesome guide: 
Also covers protecting your node.
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:42:08
Ofcourse  :D
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:02:07
I don't have a PC which I can leave 24/7 running and I'm not in any rush to get my node up and running asap :) With PI, I don't have to worry about anything.
Yes harddrive is formatted ext4 and I have txindex=1 in Bitcoin config.
My external drive doesn't have a power supply. It only has a usb connection. Any tips?
Edit: Harddisk is WD My Passport 1TB

SoC is built by Broadcom, and Broadcom does not sell that particular chip to anyone else other than Raspberry Pi Foundation. 


Altering source code requires commits on the main branch, which are ofcourse audited by hundreds of developers all over the world.
The least I can do is make sure I'm not trusting a third party to broadcast my transaction without altering them and that I'm following the consensus to which I agree.
There are layers to verification :) if I could verify everything, I would be a god :D
@_date: 2018-07-23 10:41:47
Nice. I'll checkout the new dashboard.
I turned off swapping completely, thought I wouldn't need it on 1GB ram. I'll swap to HDD today I guess.
Your tutorial already had a link to test node reachability and it returns success as false.
I'll try couple of days to make it reachable. Want to see if my ISP is doing something funny.
If nothing works, I'll DM you my IP :)
