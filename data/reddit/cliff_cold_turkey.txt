Als de prijs daalt wil je zo weinig mogelijk in voorraad hebben.

Did you look in the Legacy wallet on the Ledger? It also has a Segwit wallet which is not supported bij Coinbase.

Ah, Fakoshi Scammomoto. 
Scams exist only to scam people out of their money.

This seed words will restore your wallet if you enter them in Breadwallet. Install it on your android. go to settings and then restore a wallet and enter your seed words. Worked for me. MB is indeed crap.
Another possibillity is the coinomi wallet. Now you have to enter your wallet words over here:
Read carefully what it says. Generate the list of adresses, hover with your mouse pointer over the private key(s) and scan them with your phone.
You can claim your BCH an BCG in the same way.

And don't forget to scan for BCH also. Coinomi has Shapeshift so dump that shit as fast as you can.

They will create a massive volume of no bitcoins with unlimited self-printed fiat only to manipulate the price with giant shorts.

Socializing the losses. Now that is something they know all about.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:46:10
Do you have the seed words or don't you. It's the sentence of random english words that MB made you write up on first install.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:03:05
Use coinomi (android) and just scan your private key. works like charm.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:39:21
Do you have the seed words? Then you can restore your wallet in another program. i.e. Breadwallet.

You should look at the cost of capital woven in the price you pay for a random product. From mining the resources to fabication, transportation, distribution and retail, each step has its bankloans in one form or the other. I've seen estimations up to 70% of the retail price. Imagine that; 70% of the efforts (and consumed energy) of humankind just to feed the banksters.
Buy bitcoin. The best you can do to help the environment.

Coinomi is quite ok but BCH is shit.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:02:42
They don't only spam the mempool.
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:50:59
Wrong. You just exited the cave into the fresh air where nobody parasites your efforts in life.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:10:39
Great story with good conclusions.

Any currency that doesn't need 19 carrier groups, 2 wars a year and this haloween-parade of parasites to give it value  is my currency.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:22:21
Do you realy think that they can prevent you and me exchanging some one's and zero's? 
All they can do is try to FUD you out of your bitcoins.

Try buying at 1 milion in 3 years.

Looks more like quantitative easing for dummy's
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:49:25
Nice BS. He forgets the only reason the dollar has any value at all; 19 carrier groups and flattening 1 or 2 country's a year; Swallow it bichess!

I once restored a unresponsive MB wallet using the seed words in Breadwallet on android. Worked like charm.

How about never ending warfare, needed to force acceptance of worthless fiat by flattening any opposition.
All wars are bankster wars.
Anybody knows how much energy it takes to keep the wartoys going globaly?

Very good! Thanks for posting.

JP Morgan was a pirate that started a bank.

Is that you Roger?
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:29:25
recover your wallet with the seed words in breadwallet. Worked for me with exactly the same problems in multibit HD.
