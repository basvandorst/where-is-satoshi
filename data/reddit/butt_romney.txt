The idea that Ulbrecht hasn't been charged with murder for hire is simply wrong. You seem incapable of understanding that he's been charged with one set of crimes in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (the case about to go to trial) and another set of crimes in the US District Court for the District of Maryland (the murder for hire charges). These are two separate proceedings, conducted by two separate prosecutor's offices, in two different courts, in front of two different judges, in two different states.
The fact that the NY charges are going to trial first does not in any way mean the MD charges have been dropped. In fact, it is constitutionally impossible to try him simultaneously in both courts because to do so would violate his sixth amendment right to confront his accusers and his due process rights, under the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments, to be present at his trial.  
Instead of reading bitcoin news media for your legal analysis, I suggest reading the court documents and the Constitution.  Article III of the Constitution and the Sixth Amendment, in particular, may be enlightening.  
In fact, even the "freeross.org" site acknowledges he's been charged in Maryland for murder for hire:

Why would an honest company sell a miner if they could make more money by keeping and running it themselves?

Are they releasing the results of the fall semester MIT Bitcoin distribution at the expo?

You seriously think that the same government law enforcement agencies that have developed the ability to record every email and phone call in the world in real time wouldn't be able to understand Bitcoin?

Great idea! Once the IRS has your public key, it'll be simple to make sure you pay capital gains taxes properly.

Does anyone have a link to a review of Xapo's btc debit card program? I believe that was going to launch a few months ago and I'm curious how users are finding it to be.

This is how the US Marshals Service sells things. It's called a Marshal sale and it's part of their job. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin in particular

Speaking of quasi-endorsement by prominent universities, does anyone know what happened to the $250k for the MIT Bitcoin project?  The website still hasn't been updated since November (before the close of registration) so I assume the promoters kept all the bitcoin.  anyone have contrary proof?

Isn't it doing better than every other major fiat currency as well as Bitcoin?

does this mean that their brick and mortar operation is run through Amazon wish lists too? If so, expect to see some law enforcement take a remarkable interest in the business.

An appeal is basically a decision on whether the trial judge made the correct decisions. If evidence wasn't part of the trial, it's not part of the appeal.

Doesn't this only make even a tiny bit of sense if each Bitcoin can only be used once per year for remittances?

I don't think your prices are competitive or very enticing.  Maybe you could do the dollar bill burning for something like 99 cents?

Where can I find information on how the Bitcoin project at MIT went last semester? Their website doesn't seem to have been updated to reflect how it went.

Why did you retype the letter instead of posting a picture or scan of it?

Thanks. I wonder what happened to the $250k they raised...

So, for example, if a military leader commands his troops to commit genocide and they massacre an entire city of non-combatants including children, while he sits back and smokes a cigar, nodding approvingly, you don't think the leader did anything wrong?

Will they be discussing the outcome of the MIT Bitcoin Project? I've had trouble finding information on that.

You consider the possibility that an obscure Rube Goldberg crypto currency asset backed by nothing except market faith may collapse to be a black swan event?
