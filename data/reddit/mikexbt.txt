Great developers who built a fantastic product. Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe that they can turn this into a profitable company, or provide a profitable exit to investors. This looks more like a blind gamble than an investment. 
The unwillingness to provide standard info such as a business plan, financials, clear revenue projections, and so forth are keeping me away. So many irresponsible business owners and pump artists have lost investor funds that much of this information is legally mandated when selling securities in major first world countries. In this case, it appears that Mycelium Holding Ltd ( “MHL”, Cyprus) is the promoter, selling tokens with SAR rights in Mycelium SIA (“SIA”, Latvia), so their securities laws and rights/protections for investors may be a little different.

According to the link provided by OP:
The organization was started in December by an anonymous donor who goes by the nickname “Pine” and claims to be among the 250 largest holders of Bitcoin in the world. The fund aims to give away $86 million worth of Bitcoin, and has already given $20 million worth of the currency to 13 organizations, including million-dollar donations to the Water Project, which provides clean water to people in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights watchdog.
(These donations can be verified thanks to Bitcoin’s digital ledger system, which records every transaction in a public database.)

Quadriga has been around for two years, has been a public company company for over six months, has offices which you can walk into in order to conduct in person transactions and verifications, and has client bitcoins insured by Lloyd's. Quadriga's volume has also beaten that of Virtex during most days this year. 
Quadriga had a temporary issue with delayed withdrawals which has been resolved.
Unlike CAVirtex: Quadriga has never been accused of stealing from investors, has never had client information leaked due to repeat hackings, and has never shut down. Quadriga also offers numerous free withdrawal methods, and still has its bank account. No surprise fees for users. 
You're more comfortable trusting Virtex with your $30k? Really? Where did that get you this year?

Quadriga experienced a temporary delay with interac withdrawals while changing payment processing partners. This issue has been resolved.

What you're looking to do is purchase bitcoins on Quadriga CX using CAD, then sell those bitcoins on a EU exchange for Euros. Then, withdraw your Euros via a SEPA transfer. You will pay a total of under 1% in fees via this method, no bank currency conversion fees or wire fees.

Connecting a bank account or credit card is not required to trade through exchanges. You can anonymously trade through most exchanges using their voucher equivalent system, under their verification threshold. Many exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, and Bitmex don't allow you to connect a bank account or credit card as they don't accept fiat. 
In Canada, for example, you can purchase flexepin vouchers at many local stores using cash, anonymously. One of our exchanges sells vouchers at community run events. These vouchers are used to fund your account, similar to a gift card. 
Another option is, of course, crypto to crypto trades which can be  anonymous.

Sounds like you consider buying Bitcoin to be gambling. Those of us who invest expect positive returns. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 07:34:25


Seems that way. Apparently, Vanguard has patented the mechanics of issuing ETF shares as a different share class of a traditional mutual fund. This means they will have identical tax efficiency (and the efficiency should be high).
So in the end it comes down to: The mutual fund could be slightly more beneficial for Americans who are still contributing to their investment allocation due to free dividend reinvestment. The ETF, offering access to international users and liquidity during market hours causing less friction when tax loss harvesting and rebalancing, etc would be preferred by the rest of us.
Edit: Many brokers offer free reinvestment of dividends and fractional shares of such ETFs. I see no substantial benefit to going directly with the fund over the ETF.

"Capital gain taxes are only realized on an ETF when the entire investment is sold whereas a mutual fund incurs capital taxes every time the assets in the fund are sold.
Since the assets in a mutual fund are actively traded by a fund manager, every time equities are sold for a profit, capital gain taxes must be paid. Over the course of time, that can add up to a lot of frequent tax incursions."

"An institutional investor is an organization that invests on behalf of its members. Institutional investors face fewer protective regulations because it is assumed they are more knowledgeable and better able to protect themselves. There are generally six types of institutional investors: endowment funds, commercial banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds and insurance companies."

This isn't about innovation, it's about fraud prevention. Most exchanges and traders do not accept interac e-mail transfer in exchange for bitcoins due to the extremely high risk of fraud, and ability to initiate a chargeback. 
Your bank drafts could require a hold period by the banks for fraud prevention purposes. A Canada post money order can be cashed and verified as authentic in a far more expedient and efficient manner.

Take a look at order depth. If you were to purchase 5 bitcoins on Kraken, you're taking the price all the way up to $614 from $605.90. On Quadriga, you're still at $611. Quadriga currently has more buyers than sellers, particularly compared to Kraken. One reason for this is the availability of numerous convenient domestic deposit options at Quadriga. You need to send a wire to Japan to fund your Kraken account with CAD.
