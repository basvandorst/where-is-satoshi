i sort of agree with this. it is useful if you are only using mobile.
But i only use it as a sidekick to my computer.
@_date: 2013-05-13 23:14:35
im interested in knowing this as well

i can already use my phone to get a text message from blockchain as two factor. other services use yubikey / google authenticator
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:41:29
does anyone know if blockchain.info will be updating this ?

the legal status is actually not the primary concern. as long as they are not handling fiat money. 
The biggest issues is 
A) ATT, Verzion, &amp; t-mobile have decided to block google wallet on their network/devices.
B) NFC is not yet a widely adopted technology.

already a fan, i like that you are integrating many emerging technologies with your brand (kickstarter now bitcoin). i am curious what else you are using that I dont know about.

I would think it is insanely easy to implement btc with google wallet since most of their andriod phones have NFC capabilities. Which means that in theory you can just swipe your phone for payments at mcdonalds / 7-11 etc.

I would treat it like a ponzi scheme, because it most likely is. So only deposit if you feel like gambling.
@_date: 2013-05-08 18:45:38
So how does this work ?
How in theory does a collective "pump" ?
@_date: 2013-05-12 15:54:53
They cant make it their own persay...
My point was that they have the infrastructure already. They would just have to integrate the bitcoin protocol.

Awesome job on the animation. Could you possibly tell the curious folks out here (which I am one of), what AE scripting is ?
