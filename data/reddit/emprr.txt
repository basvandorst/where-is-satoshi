Tbh I don't use an AV software... Maybe I should look into that.
Any suggestions for OSX?

I generated the address using the address generator on BitcoinPaperWallet.com
That is the only link that would solve the mystery, if it was bitcoinpaperwallet.com that stole my coins.
The paper wallet was printed and stored in my cupboard. My roommate does not know how to use bitcoin, and generally I have no reason to suspect the people I know and are in contact with. Most of them don't even know I had bitcoin.
I am not sure if the private key was encrypted.
Seems like this would be an error on my part, just that I thought I had taken measures to be safe but it seems I might have overlooked a few things

Yea I meant it the other way sorry! Bought in November, the transaction happened in December.
There are people in and out of my house all the time, but I keep the paper wallet next to my bed in the cupboard I doubt anyone wouldve gone out of their way to get to it.

I know right? You already bought the thing, might as well enjoy it!

Thanks for the video! I guess I went into it without taking enough precautions.

Yea dude, I know that now.
Was just in a state of panic when I wrote this. I'm pretty glad I only invested so much and not more.

I haven't made any transactions at all.

Ah meant the other way around. Bought in November, it was emptied in December

Sounds like they want you to tell them the reason...
