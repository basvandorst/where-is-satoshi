This is probably the entire reason, if any of it is even true, that they would have such a policy.  Google Wallet probably requires some sort of refund policy for which there is inherently none when buying bitcoin.

Refusing a search by itself is not enough grounds to obtain a warrant.  And capitulating to groundless demands is often what they rely on.

So much this.  Why so many people voluntarily submit to these searches is beyond me.

You should. I do blame him for not exercising his 4th amendment rights.  Yes these seizures need to stop but people also need to know and exercise their rights.

Thank you for the in depth description of the actual problem.

Thought of this immediately.  Technically you could mine bitcoin "just by thinking about it". Although it does require a lot of sustained thought to do so.

Are we trusting PC mag clickbait now.

Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't this only apply to their wallets and not the multisig vault option they have?

How does tipping work on reddit?

I'm somewhat interested in setting up a private bode at home. I've got a 50/7 MBit connection through TWC at the moment.  Does running a full node take a lot of bandwidth?  Could I run it part time if so?

According to [this page]( you have control of the keys and can even send Bitcoin without interaction with coinbase.

You could probably set QOS options for port 8333.  Anyone try this?

Let's say you have 100 shares that you bought at $100 per share worth $10000 total and the price drops to $50 per share or $5000 total. If you sell all 100 shares at that price you have lost $5000 dollars. However if the price further drops to $25 per share and you buy back in. Your $5000 can now buy 200 shares. Meaning. You're still at a loss but if the price goes back up to $100 per share you will have $20000.  You can sacrifice short term losses for long term gains but it requires patience.
