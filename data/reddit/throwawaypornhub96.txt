You can't cash out cad on coinbase.

I just woke up and I noticed my exchange had went all the way down to 9600 while I was sleeping.

I think about this often. These guys live in the middle of buttfuck nowhere. I wonder how many bitcoins they're hodling.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:18:06
I can't imagine being that rich and if I was I would already own a Porsche.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:26:39
A lot of people apparently. You can find it on coinbase.

July this tweet made me buy btc for the first time.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:53:18
LOL good luck with that. Banks can do whatever the fuck they want it's only going to get worst. This is 100% why I support btc.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:29:16
If it goes up to $20000 you'll have $400.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:10:51
Because you lost all of your bitcoins on a bet today?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:00:48
The price will eventually drop it might not be after it hits it $10000. I've lost money on my initial investment twice. Now I'm high enough that will probably never happen again unless something crazy happens. You have to expect dramatic dips to get dramatic highs. If you want to make money you have to hodl no matter what.

A significant dip is always completely unpredictable things like China and bcash. A better thing to predict is trading psychology like when btc hits 10000 usd.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:42:00
Here's the dip
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:30:04
I got into btc back in July was talking about it non stop to my now ex bf. I think he dropped like $50 into eth. Was dating a new guy in October told him I bought btc with a tiny fraction of an inheritance. He stressed that I needed to sell before segwit2x and that I was a horrible person for gambling money that wasn't mine. Broke up with him the very next day. I hope whenever they hear about bitcoin they think about me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:03:03
Not only did you not hodl you panicked on top of that 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:19:47
Usually it's people who have 100 bucks invested. They're poor and stupid. $100 is a lot of money to them and they shouldn't be playing this game.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:23:24
Why do people post shit like this??? Are you stupid or trolling?
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:19:40

Stupid it is. This isn't the place for emotions.

Usually it's Asia this is a nice change.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:28:14
It dropped 1%. . .

They probably thought about buying bitcoins one time three years ago.

Buying the dip is steady nerves

If 5000 pounds is serious money to you then don't invest it in btc. What amount do you consider play money invest that. If you can't handle losing money in the beginning you will never ever make money off bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:47:19
How is it a full on bubble crash when it jumped back up by $1000. The ship is going down but it will never go straight to 0.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:44:06
You sold during a double dip. . .
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:38:44
It's Friday so ya probably like almost every Friday. . .
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:24:23
Buy the dip but only put in what you're willing to lose. Sit and do nothing.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:30:06
Stop the emotional bullshit commentary if you're going to be like that keep it to yourself.

@_date: 2018-02-05 22:49:59
This. You're playing into some heavy psychology if you're selling at the bottom of a dip. (double dip)
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:41:54
The possibility of buying back in cheaper and increasing your amount of btc?
