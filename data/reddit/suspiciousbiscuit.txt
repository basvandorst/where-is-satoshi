Literally the only reason I voted trump was because the democratic candidate was somehow worse.
This year looks like it will be more or less the same thing. I don't like Warren, Biden or Harris. Buttigieg, Williamson, Beto, and Yang are all interesting. The others I don't know enough about. Anyway, National politics mean fuck all to me. I'm more concerned with state/local, and vote for a good mix of red and blue in those elections.

I may be narrow minded about this, but the only difference to the internet in the 90's and BTC today is that you couldn't buy internet and hold it to profit from it.

How do you determine which coins are lost and which ones are just in cold storage for an extended period? It's impossible. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:20:32
That's not what it was made for at all, just what it was used for in its infancy. Also, it never claimed to be anonymous. 
Bitcoin is a decentralized, immutable currency. It was created out of the 2008 housing market collapse as a means for anyone to be their own bank and completely control their financial future. Due to its cap, it is deflationary. Holding it will not weaken its spending power over time.
It is a currency for the people.

Then what did you mean by this in context to his post?
Ugggh last edit sorry. He wasn't saying Twitter was communist, yet your asking him to explain how Twitter is communist. That's how I understand it. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 01:35:38
Yeah it gets old. After a while you stop coming here first for news. I only come here after reading big news in crypto to see how the community reacts to it.
r/bitcoimmarkets is a little better, but the market is so stagnant right now that everyone is basically watching the same descending triangle from February to see which way it breaks. All the little movements are just noise until that triangle breaks. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:50:15
Dude, he's saying that gab was as alt right as Twitter is communist. He was implying that both statements are false.
But you just read what you wanted to read so you could stand on your soap box.

As far as I know they don't. I tried googling it but couldn't find anything definitive one way or the other. I guess the safe play is to assume they do unless they explicitly state they don't.

No, a spokesperson for gemini stated they do not report a  Form 1099-K to the IRS since “digital currency sales are currently regarded as personal property sales.”
However, I'm almost certain the IRS will pass a tax code or law that will change this.

The IRS didn't solely set the threshold at 20K, that was an agreed upon amount set by both them and coinbase. Originally, the IRS wanted information of every coinbase member.

Dude you start your post stating that one Satoshi is worth 1¢ then finish is saying 1 sat is $1.
If BTC = 1 million, then
1 sat is 1¢
500 sat is $5, NOT $500
If miners charged 1 sat fees then that is 1¢ fees, not $1.

Beta, HD-DVD, and laser disks are all failed tech that fall under TV. Sega game systems were successful enough to last two generations and Sega is still a company that produces video games, so they'd fall under the video game category.
There are failed companies in each sector named in this graph. Just like there are failed cryptocurrencies. Just look at the phone industry. Remember Cellular One? Nextel? Cingular? Just because single companies failed, doesn't mean the whole sector failed.
Fidget spinners are a toy. Did the whole toy industry die when the fidget spinner fad died? Did the entertainment industry die when Miley Cyrus' 15 minutes ran out?

Exactly! I think the creator of the graph used the bitcoin logo because there is no image or symbol you can relate to all of cryptocurrency. I guess if someone used 'CC' I would know what they meant, but the bitcoin logo is much more familiar.

The whole point of bitcoin is so I don't have to listen to fucks like you. My money, my keys and I'll do whatever the hell I please with it. If that means sending 200 50sat transactions at 4:30 PM EST there is nothing you can do to stop it.

Is there any type of symbol that represents cryptocurrency as a whole? That would be more accurate and fitting for this graph but i think the closest is the Bitcoin logo.
