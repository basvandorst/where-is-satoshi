I agree. Support has broken down, this bounce upward is very temporary.  It's likely we will see it head up to 14k, but then down to 10 or even 8k.  There is a ton of support at both 10 and 8k. We will probably be bear until there, until it turns around.

Who cares about paying a few thousand in network and exchange fees when you just got 750k for free.

It's down across the board in USD you mean?  
In satoshi value (relation to btc) most alts are either quite neutral or way up at the moment.

Not without heading back into the settings on each of your apps, disabling 2FA and redoing the setup.

You can't unless you are rooted and can use titanium backup.  Then your new phone would have to be rooted to restore it as well. 
One thing is you can do is buy a secondary android device (something cheap like a BLU phone) and scan secret key with both devices when you set it up.  That way if you lose one device you don't lose access to your accounts.

It's basically running an OS with an OS.  Virtualization.  Even if your primary OS gets compromised, it's likely the VM will remain fine, especially if powered down at the time of being compromised.

60 cents if you do a ach transfer and place a limit order on gdax.

I agree, but you are paying a premium to get in instantly.
I'm a bigger fan of doing a ach transfer, moving that money over to gdax wallet and placing my limit order.

Honestly if people like you had just held your coins and never used them for anything, bitcoin might not have seen the growth it saw in those early days.  It would still be worthless if no one ever used it for anything.

Do a bank transfer, move the funds to your gdax wallet and place a limit order.  You'll only pay the network fees moving it to an exchange/wallet that way.
