Yeah long transactions time. And 50 dollar transfer fee. Fuck thay shit. 
Btc will die just like Napster did. We need a new coin not this shit.

Bitcoin is the first to do this new way. What if other coins come with other better protocols. 
Bitcoin has shown the way but it might not be the one going forward. You never know what else can come up.

That just the coffee that I was drinking coming out of my nose.

You cannot compare bitcoin to internet. Like Antonius says Bitcoin is like Napster. Now it can get better or fall off. Or someone else can become BitTorrent.

4k Dollars? That's it? And you are scared for it...

Nope. It's stuck

My only concern is transaction fees. How is that going to reduce?

Thanks for the info. looking into bitinstant. Is it  really 3.99% fee??
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:22:07
AH i see. Thats too bad. Is vircwox the only place where u can buy it right now?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:00:46
Great advice. I am looking into CampBX and local bit coins now.

Yeah true. I jsut created an account in coinbase. it will be a couple of days before it validates and there is a 100 dollar limit. no idea whats going on. I am going to try that bit instant thing that the earlier comment suggested
