I knew something was fishy about this when i saw it... Karpeles is up to his old defrauding tricks again.
Lets hope they throw the book at him!

@_date: 2015-01-17 15:23:55
Hahahaha... This is priceless!!! A classic case of fail vs fail, thieves vs thieves. Just goes to show that GAW didnt have the funds... I reckon they were aiming for retirement funds!

They ban encryption the internet wont exist... If thats the way cameron is thinking maybe its time to vote against him in may... Role on the general election... I cant wait to teach politicians a lesson in humility. If they're doing that here what say do they have over North Korea and Russia... Censorship will never work!

As a domain registrar getting that information is easy... Especially when you have direct links. Shame is i cant divulge information on who he is or his address but can tell ya his from Russia.

Im glad he wont be talking! Had enough of his spiel the last few months... Obviously hes got much to hide!
Now this is a conference that may boost Bitcoin! Bitcoin is Bitcoin and always will be... Dont need altcoins there for publicity!
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:24:56
Sick that even Paycoin is being promoted there... Bitcoin is Bitcoin! Still isn't it amazing how much money can buy ya alt coin a place at one of the largest conferences of the year.
Bitcoin conferences should be just for bitcoin not paycoin or any other kinda coin.
