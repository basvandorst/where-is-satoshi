very little if you can manage to raid a datacenter and steal mining equipment

That's this link, the one you're commenting in. Why are you posting it?

Ah yes, "leaked" by downloading it from the official GAO website.

It's open source under a fucking bizarre license, so it's unlikely to be continued unless people don't care about legality (which means, if they *were* compromised by a gov, that it can be trivially shut down)

Whoever PassportsForBitcoin is paying (in USD, converted from Bitcoin) is going to have their license revoked.

Breaking news: Site designed to be used for laundering money from stolen credit cards turns out to be used for laundering money from stolen credit cards!

Bitstamp is on fire, he should wait.

You'd think they at least have averaged two exchanges to make it less obvious that they're relying on a single exchange
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:04:48
They are no longer using Bitstamp's feed, switched over to BitFinex (claiming "multiple sources" but matches BitFinex exactly)

Terrible headline/article. Sure, it *could* have been an RNG attack, but it could have been anything else too. There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest bad RNG.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:27:12
Their price is identical to Bitfinex's
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:41:36
Don't put it in a headline if the only source is "a completely unrelated guy said it *might* be this based on random speculation"

not everything is a conspiracy

TPB.cr (third site listed) is an unauthorized mirror of TPB that engages in malicious spam. Turn off your adblocker and click around and you'll get popups naming your ISP and saying you're infected with a virus and need to call them. Not really impressive shit here

Your post advocates a  
(x) technical ( ) legislative (x) market-based ( ) vigilante  
approach to fighting spam. Your idea will not work. Here is why it won't work. (One or more of the following may apply to your particular idea, and it may have other flaws which used to vary from state to state before a bad federal law was passed.)  
(x) Spammers can easily use it to harvest email addresses  
(x) Mailing lists and other legitimate email uses would be affected  
( ) No one will be able to find the guy or collect the money  
( ) It is defenseless against brute force attacks  
( ) It will stop spam for two weeks and then we'll be stuck with it  
(x) Users of email will not put up with it  
( ) Microsoft will not put up with it  
( ) The police will not put up with it  
(x) Requires too much cooperation from spammers  
(x) Requires immediate total cooperation from everybody at once  
(x) Many email users cannot afford to lose business or alienate potential employers  
( ) Spammers don't care about invalid addresses in their lists  
( ) Anyone could anonymously destroy anyone else's career or business  
Specifically, your plan fails to account for  
( ) Laws expressly prohibiting it  
( ) Lack of centrally controlling authority for email  
( ) Open relays in foreign countries  
( ) Ease of searching tiny alphanumeric address space of all email addresses  
( ) Asshats  
(x) Jurisdictional problems  
(x) Unpopularity of weird new taxes  
(x) Public reluctance to accept weird new forms of money  
(x) Huge existing software investment in SMTP  
( ) Susceptibility of protocols other than SMTP to attack  
( ) Willingness of users to install OS patches received by email  
( ) Armies of worm riddled broadband-connected Windows boxes  
( ) Eternal arms race involved in all filtering approaches  
(x) Extreme profitability of spam  
(x) Joe jobs and/or identity theft  
( ) Technically illiterate politicians  
( ) Extreme stupidity on the part of people who do business with spammers  
(x) Dishonesty on the part of spammers themselves  
( ) Bandwidth costs that are unaffected by client filtering  
( ) Outlook  
and the following philosophical objections may also apply:  
(x) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever  
been shown practical  
( ) Any scheme based on opt-out is unacceptable  
( ) SMTP headers should not be the subject of legislation  
( ) Blacklists suck  
( ) Whitelists suck  
( ) We should be able to talk about Viagra without being censored  
( ) Countermeasures should not involve wire fraud or credit card fraud  
( ) Countermeasures should not involve sabotage of public networks  
( ) Countermeasures must work if phased in gradually  
(x) Sending email should be free  
( ) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?  
( ) Incompatiblity with open source or open source licenses  
( ) Feel-good measures do nothing to solve the problem  
( ) Temporary/one-time email addresses are cumbersome  
( ) I don't want the government reading my email  
( ) Killing them that way is not slow and painful enough  
Furthermore, this is what I think about you:  
(x) Sorry dude, but I don't think it would work.  
( ) This is a stupid idea, and you're a stupid person for suggesting it.  
( ) Nice try, assh0le! I'm going to find out where you live and burn your  
house down!
