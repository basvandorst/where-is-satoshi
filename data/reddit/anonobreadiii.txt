Belcher created JoinMarket, the most popular implementation of CoinJoin today which is so far the only viable option for Bitcoin anonymity. He's an expert in low level systems programming and an outspoken advocate for user privacy - to the point that most governments would consider him a privacy extremist.

That's as absurd as saying gold and silver need to tie in with the "normal" world.
Does GOLD need to tie in with the normal world for it to be valuable?

Sorry, but I have no idea what you're trying to say in plain English. Can you please reword this?


And that's great, if it happens that way then a lightweight core blockchain will sync in minutes not hours and full node wallets will replace SPV - boosting Bitcoin's decentralization and trustlessness to never before seen heights. This makes Bitcoin into an untouchable commodity on par with physical gold.
Of course, Moore's Law and Nielsen's law /gasp may not hold.
In 10 years, most ordinary people will come to realize making full blockchain writes is inherently riddled with complexity and unpredictable costs much moreso than using the simple, beautiful LN and voting pools wallets - the latter being dedicated payment platforms without the completely unpredictable fees and widely misunderstood confirmation times of a blockchain will offer significantly improved customer satisfaction. Meanwhile most people will CONTINUE NEVER SPENDING BTC and hold it - unmoving - in highly secure hardware wallets.

And this:


... seem rather at odds with one another unless you're taking a decentralist position here without my realizing it.
For the XTers, large, readily identifiable Corporations *already do* most of the Bitcoin mining - this will only get worse over time. All that's left for a State actor to do then is nuke all the individual node owners off the network.
That way it will be down entirely to Corporations running the backbone of Bitcoin in datacenters controlled by other Corporations.
This makes Bitcoin controllable.
If you want to avoid capture and keep Bitcoin pure, you have to keep it small.

Baseless speculation.


You mean like Shapeshift.io? Sorry, they're already outsourcing their node to a full-node-as-a-service company called Chain.com.


Bitcoin adoption has increased exponentially and full node counts are at an all time low.




Isn't it obvious? The harder it is to sync the blockchain, the less ordinary people will sync the blockchain. Eureka.
But if instead of *squandering* Moore's Law on Doritos-in-the-chain, we used that to lean out the blockchain sync to minutes not hours - ordinary people would run nodes on home PCs dramatically boosting decentralization, network resilience and user privacy.

Bitcoin exchanges very commonly segregate their money into hot and cold wallets. With this in mind, I have the following questions for the round table:
1. Do you agree the hot-cold wallet paradigm will *increase* in importance for end users to stay safe as the price of BTC rises?
2. Do you agree there will be two primary classes of wallets, with one catering to hot wallet spendability and the other catering to security?

Interesting observations, and I of course agree with your characterization of mining centralization. I've long held that if nodes become just as centralized as mining, it'll be the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin.


Satoshi's intention first and foremost was to create a global currency that operates without intermediaries.
It's very clear intermediaries are bad when they hold your money directly in THEIR vaults, but what's not so apparent is that the "intermediaries" in Bitcoin can exact control over your money by controlling all Bitcoin mining and all Bitcoin nodes. You also have to think beyond a single intermediary and look at how large Corporations cave in to big government demands. The Corporati effectively act as a single soulless enterprise, there primarily for shareholder profit and shying away from all government confrontation for this reason.
For example, if Intel and BitFury do 100% of the mining, while Google and Apple run 100% of the nodes, what difference is there between how these four corporations respond to a government demand, and how the NYSE will respond to government demands on its own private ledger? It's just four large corporations instead of one. Look what happened with NSA PRISM - they were able to bend over all major US tech companies without a peep. These large Corporations respond in all the same ways, so if only large Corporations do all the Bitcoin mining and run all the nodes - that's quite the same as one Corporation running a permissioned ledger.
And who should want to buy permissioned ledger coins? Technically you can "hold" permissioned ledger coins in a wallet without an intermediary. But that's completely and entirely pointless. If the intermediary controls everything about a cryptocurrency behind the scenes, how is that any better than handing an intermediary your money in the first place? With solutions like sidechains, LN and voting pools ready in the pipeline, is this really what Satoshi would lean towards making Bitcoin become?

It's great to see industry veterans voicing support for Back's 2-4-8 plan.
But I do have a quip with Stephen's logic here:


While it's true that only a few people would be able to afford **on-blockchain** transactions if fees are extremely high, LN and voting pools provide a fair middle ground where daily consumerist BTC transactions can still occur at super low fees, instantly and without sacrificing censorship resistance.
And I follow Pair's line of thinking here - if only 5 megabanks can afford to settle **on the blockchain** why wouldn't they adopt a permissioned ledger? But the logic is trivially falsifiable by looking at US Dollars for one.
Most notably, US Dollar ISSUANCE is **inflationary** and controlled by a tiny elite that denies entrance to any would be competitors.
Conversely, even at a $20 on-blockchain transaction fee, your entrance fee is global and highly accessible at that cost level. Furthermore, with blockchain resource usage minimized, anyone can run a full node and open ancillary Bitcoin services easily at minimum possible cost.
Meanwhile, holding US Dollars as an end user isn't safe due to widely abused civil asset forfeiture laws and the risk of political intervention. The chances of an individual gaining priviledged access to core banking functions is slim to none.
BTC held in cold storage stands immune to inflation over the long term, and is continuously protected from civil asset forfeiture and political intervention.
So no matter HOW expensive it is to transact ON THE BLOCKCHAIN, holding BTC in cold storage STILL retains advantages over the incumbent fiat system.
Now, BTC held at Coinbase is at the opposite extreme of BTC held in cold storage. You get all the downsides of fiat currency, and all the downsides of depending on a distributed ledger save the anti-inflation protections which are, laughably, still held intact making Coinbase a net win for the end user over US Dollars held at a bank.
But critically, this all assumes the Bitcoin protocol itself isn't coopted by megabanks which under aggressively misguided growth assumptions would become the only Corporations able to afford running the nodes in datacenters owned by other Corporations while still other megacorps perform all the hashing - a terribly insidious outcome. With Corporations running all the nodes and Corporations running all the mining, depending on how few Corporations and how readily identifiable their executives are, this puts Bitcoin's key civil asset forfeiture protections, inflation-proof protections and political protections at risk. Suddenly there's not much point in owning Bitcoin at ALL, even if on-blockchain transaction fees were $0 - so what? It's $0 to make an "on-blockchain" transaction on a permissioned ledger.

No one in the decentralist camp is or has ever supported freezing the blocksize on a permanent basis. That was Hearn plainly misrepresenting the facts.
Just look at this quote by Gavin Andresen in 2011 and you'll understand what XT is *really* about:


This is the true impetus behind Bitcoin XT that Hearn et al *refuse to even talk about anymore*. This is what they believe. They WANT this future to unfold, and we can only speculate as to why.
But clearly, XTers see no problem with Corporations running all the nodes in datacenters controlled by other Corporations. That's their entire agenda.
I simply point out to them, if the NYSE's private blockchain gets subpoenaed by the government, it doesn't matter if their blockchain fees are **$0.00** and it doesn't matter if you have their permissioned ledger coins held in "cold storage". If a single Corporation does all the mining and controls all the nodes, your money is still going to be controlled by that Corporation and the Government by proxy defeating the entire purpose of you having money in cold storage.
Yet, that's what the Corporate agenda IS. They WANT you to NEED their proprietary services so that you can hold your "bitcoins" in cold storage thinking they're safe while the reality is far more insidious. For example, if Bitfury and Intel do 100% of the Bitcoin mining, while Apple and Google run 100% of the Bitcoin full nodes in datacenters, how is that ANY different from the NYSE permissioned ledger example? It's just four Corporations instead of *one*.
Do the XTers see *no difference* between a world where Google and Apple run 100% of the nodes, and a world where a diverse spectrum of individuals run the nodes on home PCs? It's a night and day difference. **It's the difference between Comcast and a mesh network**.
In closing, this was a sheer mudslinging attempt by Hearn. It was completely devoid of real world solutions to the extreme tradeoffs between centralization and full blockchain write capacity, and it's very telling that they're not even discussing the tradeoffs anymore.

Mining is already Corporate owned, and mining centralization will only get worse over time with bigger and bigger farms doing more of the hashrate.
Individual miners don't stand a chance against the megamines in the long run.
IF individuals can't run nodes either, where does that leave us in the Bitcoin world? You agree Corporations will do all the mining, so if you assume Corporations run all the nodes - that's a MAJOR issue.
Gavin Andresen is on the record in his latest blogpost agreeing with Patrick Strateman's numbers. Do you deny this?
Gavin has AGREED nobody new will be able to sync the full Bitcoin blockchain if BIP101 goes into effect and technology doesn't improve by 20% YoY.
Sir, I kindly submit to you that CORPORATIONS will run ALL the nodes in that case, because it would take a superhuman effort to keep your individual node operating for 20 years straight without ever turning it off due to computer failure or internet connectivity issues. No, the only way you can run a node in that case is in a DATACENTER controlled by a CORPORATION, and the only "organizations" as you put it, able to do that are CORPORATIONS. Oh, I'm sorry, and The Smithsonian Institute can also run a node.
If Corporations run all the nodes, you will NEVER be able to bid for inclusion into a decentralized ledger because Bitcoin's "distributed" Ledger WILL CEASE TO EXIST. As I've put to you countless times before, if Intel and TSMC do all the mining while Google and Apple run all the nodes - how is that ANY different than a permissioned ledger where ONE Corporation runs all the nodes and the miners instead of four megacorps?  Why would you even want to own permissioned ledger coins? That's an extreme example on purpose, because far too many of you XTers seem to have forgotten Bitcoin LOSES ALL PURPOSE without its decentralization. Without decentralization, Bitcoin is a *permissioned ledger* which you've just agreed is *garbage* that you would never want to own.


As I just said, your classical blockchain isn't going to be so classical anymore if Corporations run all the nodes in datacenters controlled by other Corporations.
And in no way would I recommend putting ALL of your savings onto LN or voting pools. **You don't have to** put 100% of your bitcoins in to get the benefit, especially since most people NEVER SPEND THEIR BITCOINS. Just like you don't put ALL your bitcoins onto paper wallets, you don't put ALL your bitcoins onto LN or voting pools. Risk 1% of your wealth, not 100%.
Whether it's a voting pool or LN, I don't expect anyone to put all their money there. You should be able to use either technology with a reasonably low percentge of your total bitcoins even if the on blockchain fee was $20. Keeping the bitcoin protocol decentralized is infinitely more important because without that your BTC and your "classical blockchain" is toast.

It's happened before in multiple stress tests. The solution? Raise your fee. Bitcoin didn't implode and all users who increased their fee had their transactions quickly confirmed as usual.


RBF-SE definitively solves this.


Bitcoin users can increase blockchain transaction fees on a microeconomic scale, and indeed this is the fee market sustaining miners over the long run of Bitcoin once block rewards vanish.
In addition, on-blockchain transactions can be done on [voting pools]( and LN.

With gigablocks, individuals won't be able to run full node wallets at home without having specialized hardware which puts the nodes out of reach of ordinary people, dooming nodes to be run on servers by the odd specialist. As blocks get still *larger*, gargantuan resources will be needed to run a node, at which point even the specialists will be crowded out - dooming the nodes to only be run by Corporations.
Conversely, minimal blocks lead to minimized resource usage which keeps Bitcoin free from Corporate control.

It costs AT LEAST $20 to attend certain festivals. Once you're in, you're in. It's the same with putting $1000 onto LN or [Stash]( Once you've paid the $20 entrance fee, that's it - your money is now in a different state where it can be spent instantly with near zero fee if that's what you want.

OK let's say we increase to 20MB tomorrow. Suddenly all of China adopts Bitcoin. **What then?** Are we to increase it to 8GB? Critics would have you believe Bitcoin implodes if we don't - but what if we **can't**?
Did you know we're already seeing a **1MB** block that takes a full 30 seconds to verify on a performant quad core modern CPU?
It's true, and core developer Mark Friedenbach, formerly at NASA, has FACTUALLY demonstrated that block size processing times are an exponential function. Meaning: for this 30 second full block to take **10 full minutes** to verify would take place at a block size as low as 8MB.
The fact is, this is a problem - unless you have a *supercomputer*.
Which you would - if you were a large Corporation running your node in a datacenter.
With this in mind, let's look at Exhibit A - the true impetus behind BIP101 which Gavin and Mike refuse to even talk about anymore - it's just a foregone conclusion to them. Gavin Andresen 2011, quote:


This is what they believe.
And let's not mince words: **you wouldn't even be here** on Reddit talking about confirmation times if Bitcoin was controlled by a single Corporation with that same Corporation doing all the mining.
We have a name now for a blockchain controlled by a single Corporation: **permissioned ledger**. But certainly you can have your zero fee instant transactions on a permissioned ledger with "OMG THROUGHPUT". On a permissioned ledger.
Now, let's look at the [NSA's PRISM surveillance program]( and ask what this means in light of Gavin's BIG IRON datacenter Corporate node vision.
We know from [PRISM slide 5]( that NINE large Corporations were forced to spy on their users by the US government.
This is of course because Corporations exist for the profit of their shareholders - they're no bastion of liberty.
Corporations exist only for profit and because of this they're subservient to Government demands. With PRISM we're talking about 9 different BILLION DOLLAR elite tech companies that ALL, without exception, had to bend to the Government's whims without ever uttering a word about it in public.
Hence, if 9 Corporations ran 100% of the Bitcoin full nodes and 9 Corporations did 100% of the Bitcoin mining, we can reason that the Government would have **total control over Bitcoin**.
Sir, I submit to you that transaction confirmation times wouldn't matter in that case, because Bitcoin would certainly become the Xerox of blockchains made up entirely of Corporate users thinking they're smart for having "zero conf so fast wow".
Gavin in his blogpost here makes a fallacious comparison: he's suggesting that because 32 bit address space was designed into ipv4 that's somehow equivalent with Bitcoin gigablocks.
Yet, ipv4 space being 32 bits does NOT meaningfully change the nature of the Corporate controlled internet. It's still going to be Corporate controlled whether that space is 8 bit or 128 bit. You don't care because you're not running a meaningful part of the internet's backbone on your home PC regardless.
But you ARE, today, able to run a meaningful component of the blockchain ON YOUR HOME PC. Yet full nodes at home are quickly becoming endangered thanks to this infatuation with quick and cheap zero conf, and this idea that we shouldn't care about WHO RUNS BITCOIN'S BACKBONE.
Whether ipv4 was 32 or 64 bits from the getgo makes NO DIFFERENCE at all to you.
Conversely, a lightweight core blockchain makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE in the world. It's the difference between the nodes acting like a mesh network, or access to the blockchain being gated by the likes of Comcast which are the only Corporations running the nodes.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:41:29


The exact same could be said at a block size of 8MB and 8GB. Word for word identical.
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:25:25
Absolutely. If BTC was $40,000 0.0002 BTC would be worth $8.00 so most of us would be able to afford sending 0.02 BTC worth $800 paying an $8 fee along the way to LN or a sidechain or voting pool quite easily.
And certainly more would be able to afford the $8 for the odd full blockchain write - as opposed to LN or voting pool transaction - than would be able to afford the $3,000,000 data center needed to run a trustless Bitcoin wallet.
