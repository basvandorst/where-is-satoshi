You have bits of gold and silver in your pocket that enable the physical infrastructure for bitcoin to exist.

I'll hit you up on MySpace yo

Great advice!

So the future of bitcoin is money injections by central banks?

Depending where you live you might have to pay the tax man on your profits.

Shit jumped the shark long before most of the "hodlers" bought their first 1/10 eth last month

Prepared mentally for what?

So we go back to measuring the physical mass of the Nobel metal and create an exchange rate based on market rates for transactions.
Never likely to happen again, but much more realistic than global adoption of an immeasurable digital currency taking hold in a default at this point in humanity.

Probably take a couple of weeks

I hate to be a conspiracy theorist but I really have a hard time believing btc isn’t an nsa/govt beta test of blockchain.  They are the whales who can shut down btc before they roll out their own mass adopted alternate.

Forget what? It could be 0.0001 bolivar/bitcoin next week and 10k for a pizza would be a steal

Civilization and society collapsing now? Services (whatever that means). Transport is now reliant on the internet?
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:17:15
Roman viaducts, roads, and infrastructure are still holding up in quite a few areas of the world.

Civilization ? 
@_date: 2018-12-24 09:32:15
It has become so. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:51:37
Most of the transport in the western world is run on redundant systems that predate the internet (by a really long time) and would fall back to those operations quickly if we understood that we are forever offline.
