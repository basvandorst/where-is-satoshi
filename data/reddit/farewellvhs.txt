SpaceX and internet competitors is actually one of my main arguments since years ago for crypto explosive adoption by 2030. While technically internet coverage is actually very good for trading and email already, everyone having access to video content and especially tutorials and education is going to be huge.

Try changelly. Works the same, but no limits and only need email for trouble shooting. I've used both and shapeshift (granted it's been 1+ years since both) is or at least used to be more for $500 USD or less values. But reach has different selections of coins so check that and fees.
As for the process with either, I've used them a total of probably 10-20x and never had a bad experience. But compared to exchanges, waiting using maker limit orders with zero fees that execute automatically, these lite exchanges can be good if you're starting out, but are freaky first time because you're sitting there for 30-60 minutes with a spinning wheel and your funds vanishing from your wallet before they eventually appear at the destination. The process gave me stress several times, but all worked out and they refund if there's a problem instantly I think.
Use normal exchanges if possible as the experience is just so much better and less stressful and there's I think much higher volume so you can do a bazillion dollars like on coinbase pro limit no fees and it'll go through instantly.
