Did... Did you just seriously call this a social issue?
Depends on the person as in most women are still creeped out if you're creepy regardless of your face. Sure, you can keep telling me it's not true and I know it, but then I'd direct you to the thumbnail on the article. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:00:02
That's fine, it's not for your sake, it's for mine. I just rather play Pokemon right now. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 02:27:36
More like don't say, 'How many times do I have to say this' when something was only said once. It makes no sense in that situation.

Attractive is also subjective. It depends on many factors, I'm not the most physically attractive person in the world, nor am I stunning, yet I had a few marriage proposals and quite a few people pursuing me of both genders. Serious proposals, ones where people actually got upset when I rejected them. So what makes a person attractive? What made me attractive to those people? The answer you would probably give is, 'I don't know you so I can't say' which is my point. Everything is circumstantial and requires a prior context. So when I said, 'It really depends on the person' it's because it really does depend on the person.
From all the answers I've seen(regarding creepiness) and putting them all together, creepy is when your choices are being disregarded. More specifically, you are put in a position where you make it clear that you want to leave or aren't interested, but the person is still pushing you or putting you in a position where you can't quickly leave. In the article, the woman's leg was being held on to(at least that's how I interpreted it), not only were her personal boundaries being pushed, she's also being prevented from leaving.

Depends on the person. I've had attractive people be creepy to me and I noped the fuck out of there. Your face &lt; creepiness. It's something that's been talked about fairly often on woman centric subreddits, an attractive face and body does not help you if you are creepy.

However, beautiful does not always mean attractive. The corpse flower is beautiful, but I don't want to be around that flower when it's blooming. 
No, you misinterpreted it. It's not whether you want it to be done, it's HOW it's being done. I think you read what you wanted to see there. You don't want it being done depending on HOW it's being done. 
I'm not dismissing that attractive people have a leg up, that's not deniable, I'm dismissing that attractive people can't be creepy. I instead said attractive depends on the person regardless of appearance. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:22:23
No, it would still be creepy. Attractiveness doesn't negate bad behavior. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:46:01
No, I'm actually extremely common. I am not a special flower or a special case. The problem is that men make assumptions on the character of women based on things like Revenge of the Nerds or some other crap where it shows women being complete cunts to nerds. Things like that don't actually happen. 
What I'm denying is the idea that attractive people can't be creepy not that attractive people have it easier. If you're attractive and creepy, your attractiveness won't save you.

I have this strange habit of taking what people say literally. 
I sort of run into problems when the person is British. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:27:24


What degree is that?
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:14:03
I'm not seeing where having someone say that to me would be creepy regardless of their face. Though it depends on how you say it, if you say, 'I couldn't take my eyes off you' and you're heavily breathing and staring, no thanks, I'm good. If you say it in a conversational and flirty tone, alright, let's see where this goes. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 08:28:26
Run like the wind not because she wants them, but because she wants a guarantee on them in case of this bad event. I get weary of anyone who demands any of my assets or money, fiance or not. I'm saying this as a person who gave her boyfriend 2.8 BTC because the situation required it and he asked in a very respectful way. Saying that you want someone elses money in case they leave you is not respectful in any way.
If you really want to protect yourself in case of divorce, my mother's advice comes handy, 'Become skilled enough so that you don't depend on your husband. That way if the worst happens[The worst could be divorce or illness in this context], you aren't screwed'.
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:57:25
Yeah, that is correct, it is relative to our cultural expectations and such touching isn't bad everywhere in the world, but it's not acceptable in our little corner of the world. It's behavior that puts certain people on edge regardless of appearance. I don't personally believe certain actions are okay or not okay based on a persons gender or attractiveness. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:40:39
Yeah, people did spend a lot of time telling me that attractive creepy people get a pass because they are attractive. You also didn't really say that a lot either. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:26:02
The arbitrary limit is to keep things from going bad. After 24 hours I get bored and start disregarding the arguments. The problem is that I could argue against your points, it's just that I have no will to do so if that makes sense. It would just make a bad discussion all around. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:15:48
I think we're arguing over "Step 1: Be Attractive", though truthfully I'm pretty done with the argument. We could keep going, I could keep making arguments, but I try to stop once the 24 hour mark as past. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:38:58
Or just know how to talk to people. I have social anxiety, I know how hard it is. It's very difficult to talk to people when you're afraid of talking to them, but you have to learn how to control that fear and be able to talk to people. It's like controlling a phobia of needles when you need to get blood drawn, it has to be done.

Once. That's not beating it into a point though.

I approach these things with a sense of humor whenever possible, otherwise I'd get a heart attack.
I sent a message to Mt Gox, I told them to hire me as the CEO because there's no way I could fuck over the market any more than they have. 
Hell, I could conduct meetings through interpretive dance and things would go better.

I explain to people that bitcoin has both the properties of money and stock, it can be used as a currency but it is volatile like a stock at the moment, even if the comparison is not entirely true, it is a comparison that makes sense to people who aren't to knowledgeable on bitcoin. It does take a different kind of person to use bitcoins because of the reasons you mentioned, I don't think I'm that kind of person because every time there is a jump in prices, I get a mini heart attack.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:15:20
Eh, I sold one bitcoin at $700 at the initial rise, I don't really regret it. I got pushed into selling it by my boyfriend who panicked but I was pretty meh about it.

The other problem with them was that they also don't play nice when it comes to repairing the insides, everything is packed tightly together. If there's a cabling issue, you have a job that should take ten minutes to fix turn into a 30 min fix. Otherwise, completely gorgeous hilts, I really wanted one as a decoration for a long long time. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:26:55
Well this is only relevant if you're going to be practicing with them, as in doing actual Star Wars choreography. If you just want a toy, then it's fine. They're pretty, but the screws in them come loose to easily to be useful

There is a well made image regarding this

Stop making excuses and stop being an idiot. You lost massive amounts of money, clearly you aren't capable of trading. It's okay if you aren't good at it, what isn't okay is that you're excusing your failures and you think that debt isn't a big deal. It is NOT fair to saddle someone with debt when they expect to not have any due to having an inheritance, what you are doing makes you deserve to get your ass kicked by your sister. You aren't screwing yourself, you're screwing someone who doesn't have the ability to even legally defend herself against you. You're 23, you don't deserve to make excuses.

Because some people can't handle the stress of it anymore. I'm willing to wait it out, BTC dropped to $100 before and I imagine a ton of people sold their BTC to a, pay for Christmas, and b, because of that initial crash. There was always a bit of a fall in December when you look at the charts, it just so happened we got a trading lag at the same time.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:48:08
It scared me at first, but then I got excited. It's like a large scale economics/sociology experiment. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:45:51
I appreciate how specific the amount you give is.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:10:40
Until my Mt.Gox account is verified, I'm stuck waiting it out for about ten days. Here's hoping. I refuse to use a moneypak and use paypal. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:00:54
I'm kicking myself for not cashing out earlier and for not staying awake to figure out how Mt.Gox works. Live and learn, eh? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:59:02
I'ma buy myself a back brace that I've been needing and pay for my fiances A+ certification.
Everything else is for emergency. The last time I had an emergency, it cost $4600. My family was broke when I was growing up, hell, we're still broke now, so I'm always trying to justify a purchase to myself before I buy something. I can't help it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:16:14
How does one cash it out anyway? I'm completely ignorant to the workings of bitcoins.

I agree, it seems like our value is attached to our husbands regardless of our success, we aren't individuals. It still rings true when you aren't married, you'd be called, 'The Bakers Daughter', not Sarah. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:00:23
I especially appreciate this, it was extremely generous and even more specific. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:45:45
A bit further down I told him that I am thankful and his generosity is extremely appreciated.
Truthfully, I don't know how to react to the news, I feel like anything I could say isn't enough and understates how thankful I am, but at the same time, I want to keep my composure. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:06:26
Thanks, same to you.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:25:45
Yeah, the amount I got was 2.7k and it dropped to 1.4k.
