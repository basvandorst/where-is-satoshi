Hi, Itsik Levy here, the developer of Riders.io.
 Longing to privacy is an outdated habit that belongs to the Bitcoin early adopters, the "hard core", I was 4 years ago one of this.. 
We need to understand that the reality is very different, maybe individuals don't want to reuse addresses but big businesses and some entities are using the same addresses for a lot of reasons. 
The Blockchain is an open system and analyzing it It's definitely something that required by the market.
Thanks. you can see the Bitcointallk here:

We are actually working on that - 
whitestream - Blockchain rating.
We are developing a "credit score" for the Bitcoin wallet/clusters/users, based on their behavior on the Blockchain.
We started a pilot with several companies from the Bitcoin space and from the "regular" financial industry.
No ICO planned for now lol :)
This was our first prototype -

That's true! although I am not an a libertarian at all, but we all see how the file sharing networks (at the early 2000's) changed forever the market and the economic model of an entire industry just because the regulators couldn't do nothing, the power of the market go for the "good" products, and Bitcoin is a very good product, if the mass will adopt it in some form of a digital money, some other "market forces" will break to rules for the benefit of citizens.

This kind of development is a good approach in my opinion, it will help with standardize the Bitcoin eco system, But! It must be implemented as a "Gateway", firewall like, only for entities that want "secure" interactions on the Blockchain, it should not be a mandatory standard.
I tried to suggest something that go in the same direction as your project, some BIP with KYC :   
Today I am working on my project, its a Credit rating solution for the Blockchain called Riders:
Thanks.
