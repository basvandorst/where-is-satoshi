I use  to generate the brain wallets and I use  to create the mutisig address. Both sites provide links to download the application locally. For maximum security you should prepare an air-gapped un-networked laptop (I use a netbook running lubuntu) and use that to create your keys and your multisig address. Copy the address *only* to your regular devices for sending money to it. Don't copy the redeem script to an unsecure device until you plan emptying the address out.

and for as many or more reasons it might not be safe keeping the keys to the treasure trove anywhere in the physical universe.
its six of one and a half dozen of the other with the difference being made of preference. i wouldn't honestly recommend everyone rely on their brains to the extent that i do. i enjoy it tho

My process for creating and using multisig? Yes, been using multisig, and brain wallets, for a long time. Just hadn't combined the two until now. This is all essentially just math so it's pretty reliable if you do it properly.

Well, like I said, these is just for cold storage.. I don't intend to be spending directly out of that address, although creating transactions is pretty easy and straight forward so I would not have any trouble doing so if I decided I need to. For medium storage with light spending I use a Trezor and for a "hot wallet" that I can spend from easily I use blockchain.info and mycelium

It's also difficult for people to get self-driving cars right now... but give it some time.
