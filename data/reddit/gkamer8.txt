As someone who is 14 years old, I find it more likely than not that my first "money cycle" (as in working for money, purchasing something with that earned money) will be in bitcoin. I'm working on a site that... well... it has to do with bitcoin :)

It seems that AmEx is at least interested in bitcoin. I'm not sure where people get that because they're asking these questions they must be against it. It *could* be something positive. Maybe they want to have a service like coinbase or bitpay that links up to your AmEx account.

So I am a web developer, and I was researching lawyers and the like to use if I ever needed one. Yours was the one I noted! I'm launching a couple sites soon (one's already in beta, other one is still in development), BTW. 
Anyways, to get on topic, I think that the type of regulation bitcoin needs is on security. If you are an exchange or wallet, you need to keep up with some security standards. I like what NY has done with the bitcoin license, I really do. I'm actually secretly hoping that no one else adopts that, so Wall Street becomes the bitcoin capital of the world :)
EDIT: The big thing is to remove the stigma that bitcoin can be 'hacked' because it's a digital currency or the idea that you have to act like a guy walking through the ghetto when going to bitcoin related sites. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:08:02

I was just thinking about this the other day! I do think it would have to come as a change of the bitcoin protocol and not something like onename.io, despite it being a good start.

I think people are overeating to this: Bitcoin is not exempt from current currency/banking regulations. And why should it be? The laws' purposes and needs are apparent in a Bitcoin environment just as they are in a traditional one. 
If you want to avoid these regulations, change the laws. Don't try and undermine the laws, creating alternate currencies that use a technicality as a way to get out of regulation. 
Now, also, I think Bitcoin and the rise of cryptocurrencies has demonstrated a need for many of these regulations: Millions of people have lost money in fraudulent exchanges. In fact, I myself had money in one of them. What if that was a US Bank that I had all of my money in? That would be devastating, and maybe in order for Bitcoin to become a larger portion of people's portfolios, this type of regulation is needed. 
Will it be harder to build exchanges in the U.S? Yeah, it will. But should building an exchange be something so easy any high-school CS student could do it?

@_date: 2014-10-28 10:31:38
You can't create a new currency to get out of currency regulations. It's a currency, and the government will regulate it. Focus on changing the laws, not the things the laws govern. There are plenty of advantages to bitcoin that have nothing to do with how easy it once was to create an exchange.

No. Go to a supermarket. The vast majority of things there are fine for your health. And, health is a very strange thing. What was healthy for you has changed a great deal. It used to be high calorie foods because they filled you up the most. That was when the problem was getting emaciated from the lack of food. Now it's having too much food. There's plenty of good stuff on the shelf. Everything's unhealthy and healthy depending on who you are. 


I can have the collective knowledge of humanity in my pocket at any given time for a 20 dollar plan with a $100 phone. I can have tomatoes grown 1000 miles away for less than $5. Prices are high when there's no competition, not a lot *cough* Comcast *cough*.


Wut. 


The government still exists. The government, even in the roaring 20s where "government has never been so entwined with business," maintained sanctuaries, national parks, and pollution control. 


No. No. No. The electric car is only now coming to fruition because it's only now a good option. Back in the day, electric motors sucked. They were nothing compared to gas engines. And then after that, charging was so long it took a company like Tesla to whittle that time down. Creating the first, good, electric car has been the DREAM of companies. Why? Because people want it. When people want something, capitalism ensues. 


That's ridiculous. Competition is the reason Samsung is constantly trying to make a better phone. Competition is the reason Xbox is trying its absolute hardest to fit an expensive PC into a cheap, stylish form factor. Competition is the reason Nvidia is trying to create the best graphics card. It's the reason companies like Comcast suck so gosh darn much. 


Government is corrupt and uncontrollable because humans are corrupt and uncontrollable. If I'm a politician, and I want a nice car, my voting habits might get a little inconsistent if I had that car provided by someone who wanted a certain bill passed. That someone can be a random guy, powerful man, or corporation. That's all illegal BTW. 
Looking around, capitalism has absolutely worked. In the 20th century, the human race advanced farther than anyone could've imagined. Through the power of business, of supply and demand, I can now talk to you without knowing where you live. I'm typing a message on a digital universe entirely occupied by corporations - youtube, facebook, google. Without capitalism, the world had stagnated for nearly 4000 years. The amount of progress in the capitalist world out did all progress in recorded history. And then at the same time in the communist world, hell the semi-socialist world, it was business as usual. We went to the moon in 1969! What do you think reddit is? A nice guy? Well sort of, he's a corporation. The Free Market is the most powerful force in the world. 
Well, there you go, a wall of text.... Sorry! I had to :P

I make burgers. The better my burgers are, the more people want them. The more people want them, the more people buy them. Every successful business owner knows that. Now, the thing is, burgers cost a lot of money to make. If I cut my costs, the more profit I make. One day my meat is made of horse. Everybody hates it. I get bad reviews and people start spreading the word that my burgers aren't cow's meat. My name is Comcast. My name is Monsanto. I'm not going to be making money for much longer. It's very much in companies' interest to serve the consumer. Now with the last thing you said: that's not against their customers, that's against the competition's customers essentially making it the competition's problem. The competition should come up with his own great method! I made it, therefore I reap its benefits. If customers love it, they can shop at my store. Now the competition has to start offering even better service. Keeping company secrets is in the consumer's interest. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:37:29
When more companies start accepting bitcoins, there will be more competition which means that companies will have to lower the bitcoin price. Which means that they can't deal with the exchange rate any longer (because they lose money), so then ultimately they will stop changing their bitcoins into USD. 
Basically: One day companies will stop changing their bitcoins into USD once you make a purchase. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:10:13
Bitcoin is decentralized meaning that the Federal Reserve or any central body cannot control monetary supply.
Bitcoin, however, can indeed be regulated. Why? Because the government has guns, and if they want to seize your money, they will. If they want to enforce a ban, they will. If they want to enforce some basic financial regulation, they will.

The reasoning behind it is that no one will ever come in with bitcoin, but if someone comes in, he can have some bitcoin which for him has value in itself because it's cool. So in his mind he just works bitcoin kind of like a barter. 
Which also means that he's not taking the bitcoin and turning it into dollars. Which is cool too.

I'll have to disagree. I'm not trying to start an argument, so I won't... But: I like reddit. I like my toaster. I like my TV. I like having internet access. I enjoy my phone. I live in a nice house. I work a job that affords me the things I like. That job gets people phones, tvs, websites, etc.  I like how that works. If I didn't want to work I don't have to! But since I'm not working, people shouldn't work for me, giving me internet, giving me the things I like. I think you're more having an existential crisis, trying to focus work on what matters most, but what matters is living. To have a nice life, we need corporations making toasters because I want toast. I don't see how you just expect to have good things just appear in thin air, seemingly created through a world where there are no jobs. Science is great, but is it really the primary focus of life? Is that our main objective as a society? I'd be happy for a response clarifying if that's what you mean, I'm having a hard time figuring out what exactly your version of a utopia is.

Somewhat, but that seems like more of an alternative to traditional websites than it is of the internet itself. Like, if I wanted to make a website, I could put my code on the maidsafe network where it'd be safe. While that's awesome (and saved the link), I'm talking about decentralizing DNS - which would need, probably, (akin to a bitcoin wallet) a browser as well as some mining software that would be routers (I think?). Like, in this new network, typing youtube.com would produce an entirely different result. Is that what maidsafe is? To me it seems more like file hosting or webhosting.

Okay... so the Government buys loans from the Treasury, who get it by selling to banks, who sell the loans for profit to the Fed, (who doesn't have any money), who then sell it back to the banks, who buy loans from the Treasury and so forth. 
This process creates currency. 
Now, when you go to the bank and deposit money, the bank essentially can double it and spend it
This process creates currency. 
So the Fed basically gives money to the Treasury who give it to the government to spend it on stuff. All while the banks take a cut.

Anyways, I agree with people saying most voters don't know what bitcoin is, much less a bitlicense, and why it's bad. On top of that, the people really pushing this legislation aren't even elected officials - they're appointed.

I have this theory with cryptos:
When they are stable, people think "Woo hoo! Bitcoin is stable! That means it's going to take off!" And then the price of bitcoin goes up. Then, people say "Bitcoin is too volatile whether it went up or down! Bitcoin has no future!" And then bitcoin goes down.

"restructuring of our current model"
I see you have a strong resentment of our current system, and that's fine, but how exactly would you change it? You want to get rid of monotonous work. That makes it sound like capitalism is your jam! I mean work is *the* most expensive thing, and companies are looking to remove jobs every day. I also see you want the government to oversee the implementation of new tech. Would you like that with bitcoin? I don't see how cutting edge technology and politicians elected by people afraid of change mix at all.

I don't want anymore walls of text, so I'll keep it brief: corporations are this collective movement to make your life better. Corporations exist to serve you with food, shelter, clothing, and water. In return, corporations (because they're made up of people) want to also have food, shelter, and clothing. I agree in saying people are happiest when they're not worrying about those things, but who's supposed to provide them? And if that's really all you want, why not get a part time job? That's an option. The fact is most people like working for phones. That's why so many of us do! Anyways, I'm too enjoying this calm, understanding conversation.

Sure: I'm setting up a website for buying, selling, comparing, and talking about video games. I've done a lot of work on it, but I haven't started the marketplace yet. I figured it would be the hardest task. I needed to have a back end, delivery system, blah blah. I started looking into that today. I also had the idea of accepting bitcoins as payment as to promote the site. I set up and account on Coinbase and looked at their merchant tools... awesome. I also looked at the big picture of bitcoins and realized that there was so many benefits of using them. Easy p2p transactions, being the biggest one. No credit cards, ssn, or whatever, just a username and password, essentially. How about using QR codes IRL? That's cool. I know you guys on the sub know this, but as a person who had no idea, it's awesome.

Sure: I've never set up a store before, IRL or online, so not only would the business aspect of it be new and confusing, but also the actual programming to make it work, I figured, would be a pain, mainly because it was my first time and I wanted to get it right. To be honest, I was intrigued by bitcoins, but I had no idea what they were. So I decided to make it a priority to use them in my store. I began investigating, and I quickly found that everything I thought this store would be is not true. 
Why? - 
Also, just taking a little button, and then putting it next to the product, and then having it notify me really without any coding needed is awesome. Not only that, but also easy refunds made by simple P2P tools, hell, receiving payment via reddit? Via email? With pretty much just a number is pretty cool. Then I go into real life tip the pizza guy in them... just awesome.
