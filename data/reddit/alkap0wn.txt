"Uh, yeah man. This gibberish I just printed is worth $100. It'll probably end up being worth more later. Trust me"

**PERFECT!** Thank you!

Excellent - it came through! I have just two more questions if you will. 
1. It says "unconfirmed". Is that because I'm awaiting the blockchain to verify the transaction?
2. Why do I have so many receiving addresses?

This makes perfect sense. I've installed Electrum and it's all set up. I can't get CoinBase to send though. To view my Electrum wallet, I should click "Wallet" -&gt; "Master Public Keys", right? I then scan the QR with Coinbase which resolves the hash but when I click send, I get an error that it's an invalid wallet hash. Any thoughts?

Forgive me for being ignorant but, as I understand it, bitcoin wallets are just hashes, sequences of characters. I should buy the bitcoin via coinbase or wherever and only store the wallet key in my offline wallet, right?

Well, the power costs are around ~$80/month and the rig brings in between $480-$600/ month.

Can I use this same 12 word phrase on any wallet app to recover my wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:06:36
4K what?
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:13:18
Wait, you bought it for more than the value? Shouldn't you have received nearly 1 full BTC?
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:17:43
What does this mean exactly? I have $750 invested using the CoinBase app. How do I take my bitcoin offline - or is it already?
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:41:44
You lost me here. Is this meant to be read as “siiiiccckkkkk!”?
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:08:37
Can anyone explain what this means to a noob? I have ~$750 in bitcoin right now using the "CoinBase" app. Does this mean I should sell immediately? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:59:45
Then fucking- ay, I'm onboard! Thanks man
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:35:14
Right now with 5x 1080ti I’m at $4300.

Don't hate the player, hate the game.

That's fair. I guess there's two schools of thought. Respecting that GPUs are reserved for PCMR or respecting that those with money will choose to do as they please. I don't subscribe to either necessarily, but I see where you're coming from.

Sorry, to be clear, I’m mining various other coins and getting paid out in bitcoin via NH!

You're a saint. Took 17hrs but it finally came through. I was looking for reassurance though ;)
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:22:08
Why do you say that?
