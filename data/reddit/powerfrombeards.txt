I leave that exercise to you.

I did the same actually. Mostly because 35 was a typo that wasn't even intended. It's a rather high ambient.

I used the annual output. I may have made another calculation error. The results are still in the right order of magnitude. Enough that my assumptions add more error than my sleep deprived math.
Edit: I used a Bitcoin power usage 1/4 of yours. It might have been out of date.
Yep multiply your answer by 365 and we agree.

1.7 Billion servings per day
8 oz per serving
Assumption: Cooling from ambient temperature to drinking temperature is the majority of the energy. Refrigerator COP of 2.
heat capacity of soda is that of water.
Cooling from 30 C to 5 C. 
That runs around 2 TWh. Or 1/10th of the energy used for mining bitcoin.
That assumes all coke products and all are refrigerated before drinking and require no other refrigeration.
The difference is the number of people currently served by drinking coke products vs the number of people currently served by bitcoin. 
It is a pretty good ballpark comparison.

Way too many variables to discuss how long beverages are stored cold and in what type of cooler. For a typical refrigerator most energy is used to cool the objects, and from opening and shutting the door. It's not a large fraction for just maintaining those temperatures.
