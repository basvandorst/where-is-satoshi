Who the hell is going to throw down $100k on digital currency backed by nothing? Serious question.

Some guy bragging about buying more BTC should wake up to the fact that it's fools gold. His investment, at whatever price, is a dumb investment.

I'll be back in 5 years to say "told you so".

Did you know that cotton was used as currency in the south during the civil war?
The powers that be will not allow bitcoin to undermine their efforts to stay in power and maintain wealth. I really don't understand how anyone who invests in BTC doesn't understand this. It's like your living in an alternate universe with idealism so high that you get wealthy without all the rich and powerful doing something about it. Countries and banks are stopping it. I've been saying this for a year and everyone thought I was crazy. But looks like it's going that way. The idea of BTC has some value, but it will never work in its current condition. Continuing to invest no matter the cost is like lighting your money on fire.

LOL. Good luck with that. Vaporware. Bitcoin is fool's gold.

Sorry I only accept gold bullion!

Ah yes. That old argument. Shows how short sighted you are. But those are also held up by systematic institutions, governments and banks. And they all want to maintain power. BTC is no different than the other currencies that have tried to compete with the dollar throughout US history.

Blockchain is valuable. Power and wealth will not let BTC rise. Watch...

I have some beautiful Arizona beach front property I'd like to sell you.

With interest rates inevitably going up in October, the dollar and buying power is going to take a toll on the economy - highly doubt more people will invest in BTC to drive up the price as it's an asset, not a currency. And those who bought in recently will let their emotions get the best of them and they will sell, causing the price to drop. I respect your enthusiasm but I believe BTC isn't an all or nothin bet. It's a highly volatile risk and will continue to be in the future.
