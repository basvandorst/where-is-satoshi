This question can be easily answered with a simple test but I send and recieve BTC to my bitpay wallet all the time. From a different bitpay wallet, from a mycelium wallet, from Gemini etc.

Has anyone checked that wallet address? How much money does this dude have?

Well..... I can't argue with that but I feel like people that don't like him on substance alone are just lying to themselves.
