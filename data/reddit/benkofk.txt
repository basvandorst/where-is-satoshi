When it was $20 a piece, it seemed insane that people were paying $20 for a piece of data. I was younger, but I don’t think many people could have predicted this!

Yeah, it’s young-mid aged techies peppered with some interested older folk. The younger gen want everything, now.

Someone I know is in a crypto manipulation WhatsApp group and they pumped Reddit full of shit for bcash and withdrew at $1300... I wonder how much of an effect they had. They aren’t paid by anyone, they do it for themselves.
