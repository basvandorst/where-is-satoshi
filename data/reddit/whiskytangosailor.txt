Not to mention industrial electricians never see hot housewives, I only see many Mexicans running the machines I fix. A perk of my job is learning Spanish and sometimes the guys have their cute wives drop off some of the best authentic Mexican food I have ever had.
Shout out to mis hermanos mexicanos should they dare Reddit and find this.

Smart ass... 
How can I EARN BTC during dead points on my android at work my single serving internet friend? What is the best android wallet in your opinion and if you broke into this world again knowing what you know now what would you do?
Thanks for any input, I am not satirical when I say that I appreciate similar humor to my own. I wish I was half the techie I meet on Reddit but promise I'm not the new wave of kids ready to leave it in ruins.

Wow! Thank you for your honest info and patients with yet another new person to this rebel currency

Is it a good wallet for android? I'm giving it a shot either way but my time behind a real computer is limited these days since mine died but I have newegg sending me another hard drive.

I see. I'm not looking for handouts or to get rich anytime soon. I look at this as a way to kill time at work while dabbling in a new world that intrigues me. I'm reluctant to fully accept fractional reserve banking in merica and do want to practice it before I invest or transfer my largely disposal income. 
Making a bitcoin over a month or two watching videos and filling out surveys would be awesome. Dumping this weeks paycheck into a wallet with holes because some flunky launched a beta version too soon bad. 
It's still imaginary internet money to me just like the american dollar is to Obama. I love the idea and almost feel safe but I want to dip my small toe first rather than dive in.

Thank you kind Internet soul, I'm on it

Point taken, second edit is for you. Please forgive me for being crass, the Internet sometimes makes me that way. 
Any chance you can answer any of my questions?

I can, r/beermoney
Second from the top, Wired Magazine wrote of a homeless in Pensacola man who is supplementing his food stamps with Bitcoin. Ya, you're right, why would anyone allow you to earn money

Somewhere safe from loss, lost and theft? Would a flash drive work? I'm big and intimidating to most. Gmail? Tech savvy friend with the raid five server? Please EILI5.
