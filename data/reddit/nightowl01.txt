What is your point?

Sure, because the ideal way to do things is have every utility company digging up the streets to lay their own lines...

Rand Paul is not going to march through every city council in the US and check that they are not handing out contracts to certain companies. Because you know, the local governments are the ones who decide this type of thing.

Wow I did not realize I was debating with such an intellectual.

Or just has the private key, spends it, thus leaving an empty address for someone to find (lol)

Sorry but despite everything the US and state government has done wrong, I still trust them over my utility company and ISP. Look at what happened when anything was deregulated or privatised. The situation always gets worse. I used to be libertarian and believe in the free market but the more I read about history, the less faith I have in capitalism. For example, deregulation of markets and banking (at bequest of lobbyists and the fed) led to the financial collapse of 2008. Deregulation of the power industry gave Enron the ability to do all of their nasty deeds. Privatization of water in South America drove prices up left many people dry. But you think the invisible hand of the free market will make the internet more efficient?
Do you like open source software? News for you - much of it was written in public universities subsidized by tax dollars. The software should be free and decentralized (as should our currency and banking system) but the hardware it runs on will always be based on some kind of social infrastructure. And as of now you have 2 choices - corporations or government. If I am a statist (which I am not, as I would like to see the military dismantled), then you are most certainly a corporatist. Less regulation = no more anti trust laws to protect you from a monopolizing conglomeration forming which essentially leads to a new aristocratic and even less democratic government.
