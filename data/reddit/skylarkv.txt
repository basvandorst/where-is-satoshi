One cause doesn't rule out others. Again, I'm hardly discounting the driver you identify, and in fact completely agree it's a major--if not the primary--determinant. To say, however, that shrewd, resource-rich players are angelically sitting on their hands in an extremely volatile, famously unregulated market, choosing to forgo profits while ripe, low-hanging fruit rots on the tree... Well, we just disagree.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:37:14
*Not* manipulated--really??  Your inference seems to be that I was laying all all the sins of imperfect market pricing at the feet of manipulation. My post history proves otherwise. But if you exclude that factor as a possible--and sometimes powerful--influence, you either haven't been around markets (in-general) much, or have some stake in *not* believing it.

His point, I surmise, is that while China  *did* follow through, the worldwide cryptosphere survived quite nicely, and has thrived since. As it will in the unlikely event that South Korea follows through.

@_date: 2018-01-14 13:39:06
*"The move is alleged to be a response to an incident of international fraud associated with one of the bank’s clients."* 
Again here, as with a few other recent, similar stories, the precipitating factor appears to be weak/inadequate application of KYC/AML protocols by institutions operating within the traditional financial system. Hardly an indictment of the cryptosphere. (The same cannot be said for centralized, fiat-based setups, though they may, in their own self-interest, be incentivized to deflect by pointing a finger at cryptos.)

Lots of inequities and hypocrises surrounding government involvements in crypto. The rich get richer; LEAs constantly deride BTC as a medium for criminal activities, while at the same time putting it back in circulation by selling it to people with money to burn who also, peculiarly enough, want a lot of BTC on hand; its questionable whether the BTC should ever have been confiscated in the first place; and etc.  So, yeah, I officially sanction this rant. :)

If anything, this chart suggests to me that Bitcoin does *not* follow bubble dynamics, so much as it mimics and retraces--in spectacularly accelerated fashion due to nearly instantaneous global networking effects now--the relatively smooth, upward historical arc of gold shown on the chart.
Edit: diction.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:21:45
Last try: BTC's most recent 24-hour trading volume was $21 billion.  The NYSE (with the highest share and dollar trade volumes of any stock exchange in the world) had roughly a $76.1 billion average daily dollar trade volume in November. In other words, in the past 24 hours, BTC trade volume, in dollars, was almost one-third of the total dollar value of trades of *all* stocks on the NYSE.  So if the putative objective of the "sandwich trader" comment was to show that BTC valuation and trading are minuscule compared to the total value of stock exchange trades, then it mischaracterized the scenario. (On the other hand, if we consider BTC "currency-like" and compare it to daily USD trade volumes on FOREX, which average in the trillions $,  then the analogy tracks better.)

I suspect selling short into this BTC market anytime soon will produce a short squeeze dazzling to behold. Even *if* a bubble, shorting into this market, this early, will only destroy shorters' life savings. If you don't believe that, go back and look at the history of devastating short squeezes during the dotcom run up.  
Note: Personally, think long-term BTC price history will eventually, in retrospect, look more like an accelerated gold price vector, or a tech adoption S-curve. The above "educated guess" concerns only short-term, *worst*-case scenario dynamics.

My favorite part of the article was this:  
*"Cboe said Monday that its clearing house had increased the minimum to 44% from 33%, due to the 'bitcoin price volatility over the past few days.'*
*"The minimum on CME’s contracts is currently 35%. A CME spokeswoman said the exchange could adjust that level in response to changes in bitcoin’s volatility.*
*"The hesitation of big brokerage firms also casts doubt on whether Wall Street is ready for cryptocurrencies."*

She took out fraudulent FIAT currency loans, and was caught trying to smuggle FIAT currency out of the country. So *obviously* Bitcoin is the culprit.

Haha. Yeah, pretty funny--I mean, once I figured out what a "meme" *is*.  And definitely have to stay up with tech to have a shot at understanding *anything* now. What still bugs me was the IT dept at the place where I worked. A lot of *those* guys were "gettin' on" and could have been the poster children (very, very old children) for corps that inexplicably get easily hacked.  I'd bring pretty basic security stuff up to them and, because they didn't know how to remediate, they'd just ignore it. Oh well, it's just people's private information, right?...
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:02:09
It's a reasonable proposition. Recent projections to the same effect, made within the past month by well-informed parties, certainly took futures trading into account.

You could be right, now that I'm looking at the post history. Almost all football, even 11-12 days ago, which would've been just after the occurrence.

Over time, an entity serving purely a currency function should. Bitcoin, however, is an entity that has certain features of a currency, some features of a commodity, and also features unique to Bitcoin. As such, price discovery over time should be expected to display greater volatility, but that in itself doesn't, a priori or over the short run, dictate the price or value trajectory and outcome over the long run...

A bit of evidence in support of this interpretation?  Look at BTC trade volume. It's hefty but, despite network congestion off and on for weeks or more, we've seen at least a couple days with heavier trade volumes than during this current 24-hour cycle. If this is really a stampede to the exits, where is the actual "stampede-level" volume?  (Cf., stock market sell-offs, which bring with them record-breaking tidal waves of volume.)

Decentralized ledger technology in a transparent blockchain. (I.e., no.)

@_date: 2017-12-25 15:10:53
OK, sure. But if that's the chosen methodology, then we also saw the most spectacular rise, in absolute terms, since BTC began: from $5519 on Nov. 12, to $20,089 on Dec. 17--an astounding $14,570 leap!

@_date: 2017-12-10 03:20:05
They can, and they won't: 
Promotion piece for another recently-launched futures contract:  
**Several** possible observations, but the two I'll make are: 
(1)  Markets right now are *desperate* for some *sustained* volatility. No matter how much many futures traders may (or may not) hate BTC, they love money more, and their overriding profit-seeking motive is not well-served by a one-off to kill any goose that's laying golden eggs. 
(2) Please consider how bullish the above promo piece is, *not* just about volatility but also about the underlying basket of FANG+ securities. It's anything but a foregone conclusion that the majority of futures bets on BTC will hold a diametrically opposed sentiment.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:42:16

There is no way to derive a fair valuation for that comment.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:44:32
Yeah, not crush it. Maybe not even crash it. But certainly depress the price, helped along by weak hands...which I say with some conviction, as the market already appears to be exhibiting some fear-based selling, before futures trading even opens. (To be followed by a "relief rally" *a la* no S2X, no doubt.)
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:17:28
Unlikely. That would further increase 2017 tax liability.  Waiting to sell until taxes are filed and payment due shifts that tax liability into 2018 and allows for additional asset appreciation in the meantime (presuming those who profited in 2017 anticipate additional growth in 2018).
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:10:28
No way. Even combned CME+CBOE volumes aren't even a blip on the radar yet.

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:45:02
To be fair, though, we've also got people here (or did) who got out at $1000 and have since agonized for the opposite reason. So maybe do a bi-directional thought experiment, and decide which hurts more...

A surprisingly sedate and balanced appraisal. More like this, please, MSM!
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:27:44
Well, really my brief statement was to the effect that neither zero volatility nor "insane" volatility is good for any asset. 
As applied to crypto, though, the takeaway might be that the full characterization of this "thing" needs to unfold according to its own unique set of market dynamics, with respect to which volatility has (for now, at least) both cause and effect "vectors," for which positive and negative attributes can't yet be reliably defined. 
Or, shorter: things are pretty messy, they will be for a while, and that should not come as any surprise.
Edit: grammar.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:05:48
A little of both, sure. But if it makes you (not you, specifically; "you" meaning whoever) feel more crazy than exhilarated to have skin in the game, you maybe either find a way to change that perspective, or reduce your financial exposure until the balance tips.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:39:47
And for whatever reason, Wall Street has yet to realize that traditional investment thinking about trying to short BTC is like bringing a (dull) knife to a gunfight...

A 1000× order of magnitude is not trees,it's forests.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:29:03
I'd question the premise, "the market is up," though. If you pull back on the Bitcoin chart enough, of course, it sort of *always* looks "up." However, BTC is currently trading almost 15% off its ATH, and 5-10% off its high from even two days ago. So, even as applied to BTC, putatively forthcoming damping of volatility may render numbers like those not quite so minuscule (in the context of "dips") as time goes by.
Ed. TL;DR: Don't be too sure this isn't stabilization before a *jump*, rather than a dump.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:44:05
Yes, probably safer yet.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:32:08
Not to be *too* snarky about it, but...you've trusted your gut so far by not investing; how's that working out for you? (Counterpoint: If you are already that worried about risk/reward before you even have skin in the game, you might not have the stomach for this.)
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:47:22
We were, in fact, lucky that this is the case; otherwise, we might have seen potential risks of damage from inside threats turn into actual damages quite quickly.

Rarely gets mentioned around here, but the classic bubble chart (misapplied to Bitcoin performance at *least* as early as 2013:   ) isn't the *only* potentially applicable dynamic at work.
To the extent that BTC has characteristics of a commodity in addition to features as a currency (not to mention what's really special--in fact, *sui generis*--about it), it could, just as easily, be following a different price path, analogically related to an industry associated with another commodity showing a long history of iterative upward price movements:  
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:04:42
Smell test:   
* $10 billion per sandwich-eating button-pushing trader (using as an average, because the implication above is that $10 billion is a run-of-the-mill trade)
* Average NYSE daily dollar trade volume of $63.7 billion/day in November 2017
* Therefore, all NYSE trade is accomplished by 6-7 traders, each making one sandwich-eating 
trade per day
Ed. * OR, "ten billion" is off by a maybe a magnitude of ~~about 1000~~ **3**?
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:45:35
TBH, given the sustained barrage of anti-Bitcoin propaganda over the past month, BTC is probably way over*sold* these days.  So, just as the Dogs of the Dow are usually a good investment bet for the upcoming year, abused BTC could very well rebound and prove a *great* "value pick" for 2018.

@_date: 2017-12-14 23:27:46
A few things: 
(1) He's a gold bug, and BTC arguably competes with gold, so take hIs perspective with the requisite grain of salt; 
(2) Analysis appears primarily based on his charting, and technical charting of BTC price moves has, historically, been notoriously unreliable; and,
(3) His track record for predicting movements of other speculative investments (mostly pink sheet/OTC offerings) has been spotty at best...
The above considerations don't make him wrong, but they certainly don't help any in making him look right.
Edit: typos.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:25:17
Again, sure, if someone somehow managed to time a sale to capture the most recent absolute bottom, which HODLrs wouldn't have done--and which, as a result, perhaps calls into question the original premise...

Know they do, but think *they think* they'll be able to just hop on it and ride, just as some people come to crypto sporting their jaunty technical analysis charts and bright, shiny momentum play strategies...and then BTC eats their lunch. Over time, as the crypto  markets continue to mature, then sure, all this discussion will be rendered meaningless. Until then, though, I think Wall Street traders' introduction to seemingly *chaotic* volatility will be "interesting" to watch.

If you're not just clowning around here, I offer you the following in all earnesty: you might not have the stomach to stay in this asset class.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:49:03
Because shorting, in its simplest form, really is just a *bet* that a stock price (or, in this case, BTC price) will decrease.  It tends to *correlate* with price decreases, because who would bet their money if they didn't have some reasonable basis for thinking the asset had a good chance of doing so? However, there is by *no* means a direct *causal* relationship here. The market itself--basic supply and demand--decides whether a stock price rises or falls.
So, for instance, some people might believe the PE ratio of a certain stock is too high to sustain its price, so they bet the stock will fall. Many other people might believe the PE ratio is irrelevant to the growth of the company, and continue to buy the stock in greater numbers than people want to sell it, increasing the price. Meanwhile, the "shorts" (people who bet the price would fall) get deeper in the hole. At some point, using this betting analogy, they either close out their position voluntarily or, sometimes, involuntarily, if their bookie (broker) forces them to cover some of their current losses (short squeeze/margin call). If those things happen, the stock goes up even *more*, as shorts in essence buy some of the stock to cover their bets against it. 
TL;DR: Shorting is basically just a bet against the price of an asset, a bet that "shorts" sometimes lose (and sometimes lose their shorts on :) ).

This cycle reminds me a lot of the September death knell, during which BTC almost hit $5K before beginning a two week slide to under $3K. Different causes then, but that one also had an "It's over for Bitcoin now" feeling. I'd speculate that this time around we won't see full recovery unless/until tangible hope for resolution of congestion/fees issues appears on the horizon.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:55:21
(Note: Can't tell if maybe you're joking. On the off chance you're not, a "correction" in investorspeak doesn't generally (or really ever) refer to upward price movements. People tend to use "undervalued" or "oversold" (or other terms I'm forgetting right now) for the situation you describe.)

P.S. Now that you mention bear raids, another interesting facet of the potential influx of Wall Street money is how certain actions that are illegal for traders of regulated securities to engage in will, or will not, apply, now that there'll be some entanglement between the "Wild Wild West" of crypto and the CME/CBOE futures markets. That, in itself, could create quite a mess!
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:52:53

Considered that. But this has been an extended slide, and while HODLrs HODL, traders would presumably have positioned themselves to sell/re-buy before steam picked up on Thursday (or, if late to that party, could've Shapeshifted/converted to ETH/LTC before heading for the door).

@_date: 2017-12-30 03:26:22
1. Trading isn't all that heavy, so market is more volatile and more easily yanked in different directions. 
2. People who bought above current prices may very well be doing some tax loss harvesting to apply against other gains, including investments outside the cryptosphere. (Risky, though, if hoping to buy back in "low," especially without triggering a wash sale). 
3. As  and  occur, weak hands tend to fold, putting more downward pressure on price. 
4. If anything, these conditions suggest a great possibility for a rapid BTC run-up  when January rolls around.

@_date: 2017-12-06 05:50:18
That's not simply shorting, though. I'm not arguing against the possibility of manipulation. I'm saying, still, that shorting alone can't *force* an asset to decline. As well, leveraging by shorting through options exposes shorters to additional risk, which is something institutional players are *less* tolerant to than HODL'rs, especially now, and especially if acting on behalf of clients. (What mainstream investment brokerage firm wants to take a chance as a short, then have to tell customers it took a flier on super-volatile BTC that reduced profits because it got squeezed?)

OK, that's fine, they could do that. But what I mean is, one of the value propositions that *underwrites* currency functions within the  crypto-fintech movement/revolution is the essentially stateless character of the system.  A centralized, state-backed-and-administered cryptocurrency, whatever its merits, is a different animal from Bitcoin, Ethereum, et al.  It is, essentially, building a better-functioning fiat vehicle. Cryptos in the sense generally envisioned and discussed around here are like building a different *kind* of vehicle, along with an entirely different kind of financial "infrastructure" for them to travel on, to new places that fiat--even cloaked in the guise of "crypto"--simply can't travel.

Kind of a weird way to ask the question though, yes? If everyone here seemed very negative about this form of speculation, would it be a good omen? Is there "irrational exuberance" even? Or an extreme swing to the greed side of the fear/greed index?
IMO, there's a *blend* of fear and greed (and other things, too, of course, including principled and philosophical positions regarding crypto that are unique) that's rather extreme, but not much different in *kind* than mainstream investors' attitudes about the stock market run-up over the past several years...
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:08:11
OK, so, minus the previous tone, still true that I didn't say it can't, because you're right, it can. (If that's not too convoluted a way to say it.) And unfortunately I also can't even reliably guess how these new futures markets will interact with crypto-exchanges, because I haven't seen the financial products, how they're packaged, the mechanics of the daily fluctuation band limitations, etc., yet. (Especially curious to see how the crypto version of "percentage of float available to short" will work!)
But, insofar as futures act similarly to the way they do on "regular" stock exchanges, no matter how large established short positions become, actual pricing of the underlying asset (BTC) will still depend *primarily* on trader evaluations/sentiment, re, future price.
Not sure if that's what you were even getting at. If not, willing to keep at it until it's clear (or I see the error of my ways :) ).
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:40:40
Agree with all of that. A month ago a lot of people were feeling exactly the same about S2X, and a week or two later, feeling the same about the Cashening.  Things turned out pretty well for the HODLrs in both cases. There is strong reason for hope...

One thing holding the "cryptosphere" movement back a bit is the terminology itself. "Crypto" is cryptic, and "block"+"chain" sounds like it should be describing something found in prisons. (Let the ICO-scam jokes fly.) 
"Blockchain" as Abagnale uses it also sells the emerging technologies short, downplaying them as merely incremental improvements to record-keeping systems. In truth, decentralization, smart contract, and AI elements in conjunction with blockchain may prove key to the next leap forward in both social and commercial interactions on a global scale.

But why would they *necessarily*? Even if active Tether-BTC (or Tether-anycoin) traders get burned by T because they were holding lots of it when it imploded, don't see why they'd exit the cryptosphere entirely, unless a large volume of that trading really did rely on a presumption tgat the whole set-up was an unsustainable scam (which, at this point at least, I'm not inclined to conclude). IOW, if the concentration of losses accrues to those who were neck deep in Tether, doesn't that possibly *temper* the spillover effect to other coins, while also removing one degree of "manipulative freedom" from the crypto-trading equation? If so, seems at least plausible that Tether's demise could (eventually) promote more stability across the rest of the system.

One difference is that if I want to buy some product "with" stock, what I am actually doing is (1) putting in a sell order, (2) waiting for the market price to match my sell price, (3) waiting some more for the intermediary to officially settle the sale, then (4) requesting that my proceeds be sent to me, (5) waiting some more for that request to clear through traditional financial conduits, then (6) wiring those funds to the seller of the product, then (7) waiting again for that instruction to clear through traditional financial conduits (or I can buy on credit and (7) pay off my credit card balance with the proceeds from sale of stock). 
Or I can (1) send BTC. (And do.)

In support of that interpretation, notice the price hasn't swung back and forth wildly so much as inched up incrementally. Also--similar driver but on a smaller scale--look at the declining prices of certain alts on Bittrex, which is cutting off U.S. trading access to them this month.

Part of this is probably just a combination of the Coinbase announcement, which appears to have snuck up on some people, and the tiresome see-saw in hashrate as miners follow chain profit (
The *good* news, AFAIC, is that under the new BCH difficulty re-targeting algorithm, profitability should flip back to BTC more quickly and less "traumatically" than during past cycles. 
One thing to watch for again, though (as always), is opportunistic actions by the big-money BCH players.  Wouldn't be surprised to see them try to put up smokescreens to misdirect unwitting BTC traders into thinking they're seeing something different from what this really should be: a tempest in a teapot.

One interesting thing is that this run-up is happening even while more seasoned hands are saying things such as those in this thread. So who's driving the price? N00bs? Institutional money? Both?

This, if true, is both unacceptable and encouraging--offers at least one light at the end of one tunnel. 
Another plus: the market for BTC's biggest current challenger appears to depend on whether one or a few specific Korean exchanges continuously operate efficiently. That can't be particularly reassuring for backers of that coin's ecosystem...

(Note: I'm presuming China,miners' hash power is so overwhelming that adding new mining power to the *challenger's* chain as competition wouldn't be efficient enough to dilute profits significantly.)

@_date: 2017-11-16 22:39:43
It's a tradeoff. Traditional investing vehicles and, therefore, profit-taking guidelines do *not* presume either the magnitude of volatility or the magnitude of potential profits that we continue to see in what I'd like to call the "Bitcoin price discovery" process (vs. "bubble"). So (to oversimplify quite a bit), IMO it's a question of how much you'd regret losing a LOT of profit vs. how much you'd regret losing the potential additional profit you forego by lowering your capital base.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:18:31
Absolutely. Need somebody to explain to us why something like this *couldn't* work. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:43:23
Each new wave of entrants eventually faces "sticker shock," both on the buy side *and* the sell side. So far, this hasn't worked to the detriment of speculators with sangfroid and nerves of steel (nerfs d'acier?), or to the obvious detriment of the overall cryptosphere. I do think that each new wave of entrants may, as a class, be incrementally more risk averse, though, which does have knock on effects in the markets, as well as in the media. All that said, is there some better alternative? 
TL;DR: Sure, yes, fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy ride. That is, though, the price of admission to what, right now, is the only show in town.

My *wish* is that it would crash for the same reason I'll never support it: if a blockchain currency system like BCH is so aggressive that it's willing to provoke such rancor, and willing to promote huge destruction of capital in the overall crypto-ecosphere for its own advancement (or, rather, to advance the profiteering of its largest holders), how likely is it to gain and maintain the "full faith and credit" of small, "insignificant" holders over the long haul? 
TL;DR: For the Powers That Be of the BCH cabal, the rest of the cryptosphere's small-time buyers and sellers are HODLer fodder.

@_date: 2017-11-29 10:02:06
For one thing, BTC really is a new *kind* of "thing" with value, and what I believe we are seeing, by and large, is the market trying to *arrive* at a valuation for this hybrid thing that has certain characteristics of a security, certain transactional dynamics of a currency, *and* a strong claim to functional capacity as a store of value, like gold. There's tons more to say about the crypto-fintech revolution, but this one thing, alone, explains why Bogle's snap assessment above is at least arguably simplistic, if not substantially misguided.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:07:25
I just wonder... If all those who profess to come down on the side of advancing legacy BTC, but who are still holding their BCH "just in case," would go ahead and flood the market by selling off their "free" BCH, it might go a long way toward derailing the coordinated, hostile run-up of that coin by a concentrated group that seemingly wants to punish legacy BTC at least as much as it wants to promote BCH.

Based on the evidence, no, we cannot. 
One flaw all these pseudo-prophetic charts have in common is that they assume robust margin buying and institutionalized mechanisms in place for shorting the market. 
Yes, a few exchanges have some relatively modest margin trading in a few cryptos. And yes, there are "future futures" trading plans afoot. By-and-large, though, the cryptosphere has not yet come even close to crossing these or other red-flag risk-thresholds.

But we might at least get a glimpse behind the curtain at what more-realistic crypto market dynamics look like when the whales, too, have diminished capacity to shake coin prices and trading volumes around as if they were rag dolls.

Awesome explanation! Thanks!
F/U question, if you have any idea, or know where I might look for an answer:  The currently bloated mempool represents "money left on the table" by miners for the time being, yes? And I presume they don't care, because it'll still be waiting for them when they're ready to mine it. So, usually in a completely unfettered market, that would represent an opportunity, if somebody could find a way to profit by mining this mempool while other hash power is "elsewhere," even if *relatively* less profitable.  *If* that's so, why hasn't it happened? Is this solution basically impossible because of barriers to entry and/or razor-thin profit margins and/or no comparative advantage *ever* to mine a less-profitable chain?...
TL;DR:  Why doesn't BTC mempool bloat represent a potential profit-making opportunity for *somebody* (somebodies), who might profit by mining the less profitable chain while other miners are chasing higher returns elsewhere?

Double-edged sword, IMO. Massive infusions of capital likely--price goes up. Massive infusion of professional-grade market manipulation--price goes almost wherever the pros want it to (short-term, at least)? Could make current fork issues look like sandbox play! Or, could damp volatility. Or all of the above. Or?...

Great question! If you have money to spend, are too risk averse to chance it on BTC, but are not too risk averse (by mainstream standards) to bet on traditional securities that have skin in the blockchain game, you could buy into IBM, AMD or other relatively safe Dow/NASDAQ stocks, or even try some much riskier small (mostly OTC, or "penny") stocks that offer "purer plays" in the Bitcoin/blockchain space.
Some *examples* (NOT ENDORSEMENTS!), solely to get you started with your research, if interested: RIOT, BGGWF, BLKCF, BTCF, BTLLF, CINGF, DIGAF, GAHC, GLNNF, NVTQF, PRELF.

Excellent (and reassuring) point!
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:50:07
A *tremendous* amount of interest and product exploration by institutional investing concerns is already swirling about BTC and cryptos, with much more to come. Because of the potential tax revenue implications from this, I would be *more* surprised if U.S. Feds acted precipitously to kill the goose when she's not even "showing" yet.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:22:54
Meanwhile, the WSJ today reports yet another in a long string of stories heralding the latest DJIA all-time-high.  And, as usual, the word "bubble" never occurs once in the write-up. Myopia much, guys?
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:35:01
Could it also be possible that if some collusion did, indeed, take place, then neither the miners nor those who may have attempted to supersaturate the mempool with low or even no-cost transactions have any desire or need to push those transactions through now?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:40:21
Heh. Compromise at 75%?

@_date: 2017-11-11 02:26:18
I wish the chart had the last few months on it, but as far as it goes, it shows volatility (peaks of the standard deviations from 0) *modestly* declining, 2010 to mid-2017...

Haha! Like just about everything in the cryptosphere...
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:25:20
That's not what happened, though. Consolidation typically--in fact, reliably--provokes responses around here such as, "What happened? Why is it going down?!" To which the equally reliable and accurate answer tends to be, "Nothing happened. Just normal consolidation, profit-taking," etc.
In this case, to the contrary, the price, volume and timing of the movements were precisely and reliably correlated with technical dysfunction and resolution on a specific, relevant exchange.

Sorry? I meant, Is there some alternative to the school of hard knocks here? For many, cryptomarkets provide, in *one* respect, an avenue to greater potential returns through surrender of protection from stifling regulatory restrictions, with the obvious trade-off being assumption of (stratospherically) higher risks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:08:40

He kind of does, through his (in)action, which speaks 6 billion+ times louder than words. With his almost 1,000,000 coin stake in legacy BTC, he could wreak havoc on the markets at any time, but, assuming he's still around, apparently hasn't felt a need for repudiation through words or, more, importantly, actions, in almost 10 years.

My speculation is that a good part of this run is fueled by new money entering the (let's call it) sector, combined with "fork-funded" gains (some people cashing out BTG for BTC, ETH, and alts), as well as continuing "price discovery" in still relatively nascent markets. 
Soooo, my pure guess is that we will actually blast past the $10K (USD) barrier as if it were tissue paper (and probably past $500 for ETH) before we see the next big retracement...

Clarification: My understanding is that funds are insured against a successful attack on Coinbase, not against individual account hacks--such as those most resulting from poor individual security practices (e.g., not using 2FA, a strong password, and whatever other measures you've got available).

The one thing in this thread I agree with. The IRS *must* come up with better, crypto-specific rules, instead of continuing to shoehorn BTC, etc., into this or that asset category to which it emphatically doesn't belong!

A nuanced, well-reasoned appraisal, IMO (and one seemingly not *entirely* lost on some in the gold industry (e.g.,  end of para. 4),). though of course it's likely gold producers and market makers have different objectives in mind than making commodity pricing more transparent. ;-)

If I could even just believe the IRS (U.S.) won't treat me like a criminal when I declare my BTC profits and losses--say, by issuing a clear statement along the lines of "Cryptocurrency trading will not automatically, categorically result in an audit"--I would feel a LOT less terrified about tax season this,year. (Not that I did anything I'm aware of that an audit would expose, merely that I don't want to expend a vast amount of time and energy on something  like *that*.)

@_date: 2017-11-13 03:35:47
Yep. Over *nine years*, BTC has become the world champion of resiliency.  It's surmounted *innumerable* challenges over almost a decade--not because of luck, not because it strategized ways to survive by becoming cutthroat or devious. Just the opposite. It has endured, in large part, because it refused to be dragged down into all that. (Yeah yeah, Core this, Core that, blah blah blah. Not buyin' any of *that* anymore.) 
Over *3 months*, BCH has become the world champion of false pride.  After sliding down off BTC's coattails 14 weeks ago, it has survived in large part by pursuing a strategy of conniving opportunism, with a vindictive bent just because.  It, too, has surmounted many challenges, of course, to prove itself deserving of status as a world-class cryptocurrency while still in infancy:
(1) It got itself listed on exchanges; (2) It lucked out when China didn't shut down its miners; (3) It took advantage of its insider knowledge to devise a clever algorithm for gaming the mining system, at the expense of the coin that gave birth to it; and (4) It successfully duped traders into believing its criminal leadership cartel really does care about "the vision," or building a better coin, or *anything* other than the narrow self-interests of its richest players.
Still, two good things have come out of it all so far:
(1) BTC has learned it *must* up its game to fend off new elements that crave its demise.
(2) We finally get the answer to a question that so many people asked back in August without receiving very satisfactory replies:  "How can this spinoff coin possibly be a 'free lunch'??" Answer: It can't, and the entire cryptosphere is now paying, dearly, for the consequences of that malign, ill-intended fork.

Not necessarily disagreeing, but if we follow the analogy, (a) what does this mean, practically speaking? (from a BTC perspective, that is--the other camp's belligerant plans are somewhat more transparent), and (b) one of the enduring legacies of war is death and destruction of friends and foes alike; what would might projected landscapes look like, after an all-out conflict, depending on who "wins"?

"If yes, shift to a wallet and wait..." ViaBTC is actually offering this option to traders as an alternative to cashing out to CNY...  This and other "soft" indicators give me the impression China-based players are much less fazed by the recent hoopla than those not inured to authoritarian State rule. (Chinese traders are certainly also more sensitive to the fine line current Chinese monetary policy is walking, given their own financial vulnerability, should the Yuan tank.)

I specifically requested that GDAX raise my limit above $10K so I could withdraw in +$10K amounts, to avoid triggering AML reviews. (Yes, I do expect that to also trigger other mandatory reporting by the bank, but I pay my taxes, so that's actually a plus, too - correctly suggests I'm not trying to hide anything.) It took a while, but GDAX eventually approved, I think, $25K per day. (Note: Remains to be seen how it will all work out with the IRS in practice, of course...)

Yes! Perfect! This is exactly the point. Most people here do NOT by any stretch think BTC is a "fraud." Nor is it a fraud in the eyes of the law, the SEC, or any other U.S. regulatory authority. The point a few people in this sub seem to be missing (or obfuscating) is that if your CEO *says* it's a fraud, but his firm still honors requests from clients to broker trading in it, this is hypocritical behavior at best, in all likelihood a formal ethical lapse, and, at worst, the kind of mentality that allows institutional investment bankers to feel no remorse for slowly siphoning off capital from small investors as a business model, for *decades*. 
E.g.: 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:06:21

Thanks! Worth reading to the end of this article:
"...[If] traders read the full report, Caixin explains the regaulory crackdown is on ICOs and not Bitcoin...
"The domestic exchange between all the virtual currency and the renminbi, represented by Bitcoin, Etherfax, Okcoin, will be closed within the deadline; but the regulation is not against the virtual currency itself, nor does it prohibit the one-on-one off-exchange of the virtual currency.
"The bottom-line appears to be - just as we saw early in the year - China cracking down on capital outflows by disallowing the exchange of fiat currency into crypto via local exchange. But, most critically, they remain open-minded to the private exchange of virtual currencies. This is exactly what we saw early in the year when local P2P services jumped up to support this 'private' exchange away from 'official' exchanges.
"It appears the future of bitcoin trading will be decentralized."

"If yes, shift to a wallet and wait..." ViaBTC is actually offering this option to traders as an alternative to cashing out to CNY...  This and other "soft" indicators give me the impression China-based players are much less fazed by the recent hoopla than those not inured to authoritarian State rule. (Chinese traders are certainly also more sensitive to the fine line current Chinese monetary policy is walking, given their own financial vulnerability, should the Yuan tank.)

Good.

You realize that, for crypto-fintech, any graph showing early entry of institutional investors as a catalyst for the run-up is a bit sketchy, yes?
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:35:07
Yes! At some critical mass, acceptance promotes price inertia (cf., small, nimble, speculative ETFs vs. massive index funds). Also, after that tipping point occurred, I imagine we'd also see the quick rise of optional financial risk-transfer products (in fiat), designed to attract additional small, main street investors to the asset class, which would naturally damp volatility further. 
TL;DR: If BTC/CCs reach a tipping point of acceptance, that in itself would catalyze a cascade of "traditional" financial market processes and products to mitigate against new/secondary risks, further accelerating adoption.

I credit this general factor more heavily than the various other drivers. (Or rather, adoption may be the primary factor catalyzing several others.) I think we're beginning to see effects from some influential institutional investors' buy-in/capitulation. Consider, for instance,  . This would also help explain why we are seeing big jumps in certain BaaS crypto-fintech coins/tokens, as well as strong recent showings from some "stable-ish" coins, unrelated to the BTC fork (e.g., LTC). 
Lastly--and MOST telling, IMO--is a parallel surge of interest in blockchain-related  securities on even traditional, regulated stock exchanges (e.g., BIOP on NASD, or BTLLF, PRELF and many others OTC)...

*"Silicon Valley visionary Balaji Srinivasan explains how bitcoin works and why he regards it as revolutionary.*
*We can understand bitcoin and blockchain in four steps, he says. 'One, cash. When A gives a dollar bill to B, he’s transferring a physical object. B has it, and A no longer does. There’s implicit scarcity in the physical world.'*
*Step 2 supposes that we treat the serial numbers on those Federal Reserve bills as 'a form of naive digital cash. Then A emails those numbers to B. Now B has a copy. But A still has a copy!' So if those serial numbers were treated as cash, A can 'double-spend' the numbers by sending them to another party, C. This, Mr. Srinivasan says, is the fundamental issue with digital cash: 'the double-spend problem. How do we introduce scarcity into the digital system?'*
*The way we resolved this problem before bitcoin, Mr. Srinivasan explains in his third step, 'was through the use of centralized institutions called banks. Whenever you use PayPal or a similar technology to send money from A to B digitally, the bank is trusted to debit A and credit B.' This, he says, is how 'scarcity' is introduced into a digital system; but it is 'inelegant, from a computer-science perspective, to have a central, trusted node in any networking topology'—a word my dictionary defines, in this context, as being the way in which constituent parts are interrelated or arranged.*
*Mr. Srinivasan doesn’t care for this arrangement: 'There are downsides to implicitly trusting banks, as the 2008 financial crisis showed.' So rather than require a bank to approve transactions, 'Bitcoin figured out how to split this power across many different transaction approvers, called miners.' They 'compete to approve transactions and integrate them into the so-called blockchain. Every time they integrate a new block of transactions into the blockchain, they receive a ‘block reward’ and are entitled to print digital currency.' The key point, he says, is that any computer could, in theory, approve transactions, and no single computer could block transactions.*
*Mr. Srinivasan concedes it’s 'a big claim' to say the blockchain is the most consequential technology since the internet. 'The internet is programmable information. The blockchain is programmable scarcity.' He elaborates: 'All of these previously disparate things—from physical mail to television to music to movies to telephony—basically got turned into packets of information and got remixed by the internet. Plus things that we normally didn’t even think of as information—your Fitbit , your steps, your Facebook settings—became programmable.' It’s fair to say, he continues, 'that the internet and all things downstream—search engines, social networks, ride sharing, and so on—have basically been the technological story of the last 25 years.'*
*The blockchain is the next phase, Mr. Srinivasan says with some zest. 'With the blockchain, everything that was scarce now becomes programmable. That means cash, commodities, currencies, stocks, bonds—everything in finance is going to be transformed, and aspects of finance baked into everything else.' By way of example, Mr. Srinivasan suggests that there could be 'a spot market for the cost of storing one megabyte on 1,000 remote computers.' He then offers a slogan for the new age: 'If you deal with information, you need the internet. If you deal with money, you need to deal with blockchains.' Pretty much everyone, he adds, deals with information and money."*

Instead, here are just a few reasons why the financial establishment should hope crypto-fintech *isn’t* a bubble, and should work a little harder to be a constructive, contributing influence in realizing the potentials suggested by these nascent efforts!…

Exactly. To me this reads like a cogent, clear-sighted rundown of how much between a rock and a hard place big institutional investors really are right now. Stock markets and most other traditional asset classes are in their own historic bubbles right now, hobbling value propositions and hedge strategies. In addition, market volatility is at a near-record low, greatly crippling momentum plays. At the same time, traditional risk-averse fund managers are constrained every which way from going all cowboy in search of mother lodes in cryptoland that could boost portfolio returns. Which I also think may explain, at least a little, bitterness among the J.D.'s of the world, when confronted regularly with news of the blockbuster returns achieved by small, individual speculators and HODL'rs who aren't all just dropping money and commissions willy nilly into Wall Street's lap anymore. 
TL;DR: To me, the article sounds more like an apologia for the very difficult and very unfair profit-seeking challenges that currently afflict very rich Wall Street investment bankers.

He also has a rather short, selective memory of historical gold price volatility: 
(1)  *"GOLD-TO-SILVER RATIO

The ratio was 12 to 12½ to 1 in the Roman Republic (until 27 B.C.); 8 to 1 in Japan; 4 to 1, then 10 to 1, and later 12 to 1 in China..."*
(2) Modern era:   
(3)  
*"Inflation is by no means a modern concept, and gold prices have been surprisingly volatile throughout history...
The history of the value and price of gold is one of predictable unpredictability. As things stand today, it seems hard to imagine that national governments are going to abandon pro-inflationary policies that essentially devalue money. At the same time, gold supplies are not likely to increase significantly, which suggests further appreciation in the price of gold.

Impossible to say, because it's just proposed legislation. But per transaction could be reasonable, absent some kind of automated system that could do high-volume of withdrawals in milliseconds. The spirit of the law would likely be intended to serve *at least* two pro-CC goals (both laudable, IMO): (1) substantially reducing tax reporting burden on taxpayers (and, indirectly, increasing compliance) and CC exchanges (assuming mandatory reporting requirements), while reducing costly, labor-intensive processing procedures for the IRS; and (2) reducing a barrier to use of BTC/CCs as negotiable, liquid instruments for everyday commerce (e.g., no need to calculate capital gains for purchase of a pack of gum). Why $600? Probably a bit arbitrary, to align the figure with some other 1099 reporting thresholds though if that's the case, they could be shooting for $600 *aggregate*, maybe per source, per *year*...)
(Edit: Just noticed it includes any trades, not just CC to fiat, limited to 5!)

Sure, that's possible. Though "*far* fewer" vs. "fewer" vs. "more" depends on factors either beyond legality, or in reaction to "unfair" legalities. A couple examples: 1. Heroin is no more legal in the U.S. than it ever was, but usage ebbs and falls. 2. In Venezuela, BTC is illegal, has seen a surge in usage, and those things aren't unrelated but rather both tied to another condition--the State's failure to execute and maintain competent monetary policy...

@_date: 2017-10-13 11:42:40
I'd prefer that the financial press stop these straw man comparisons. Why? Because I see them as propaganda, intended to elicit reactionary responses from relatively more credulous and gullible readers--to the effect of, "That's not right! BTC *must* be a bubble." BTC is neither solely a stock nor solely a quasi-currency; BTC "is what it is" (and possibly more that we can't fully appreciate yet). If anything, compare BTC to the combined total value of precious metals, or compare it to various fiat M1s (which, indeed, some excellent animated gifs are already doing). Then tack on a little something extra, for the "special sauce" or "It" factor.

*"It just doesn't make sense.

E.g. (from Wikipedia): *"[I]t was revealed that [Enron's] reported financial condition was sustained by institutionalized, systematic, and creatively planned accounting fraud, known since as the Enron scandal. Enron has since become a well-known example of willful corporate fraud and corruption. The scandal also brought into question the accounting practices and activities of many corporations in the United States..."*

Yes, it's a real article, by a reporter who's been covering Bitcoin for the WSJ for some time. She also covered the Bitcoin moratorium earlier this year, writing in an article in June, *"The plunge in Chinese demand hasn’t stopped the price of bitcoin from rocketing to all-time highs. Demand in Japan has soared since rules there established the virtual currency as a legitimate payment method."* Which is to say, China is big, but by now, Bitcoin is, in some sense, even bigger.

He is worse than not not credible: he an "anti-authority," who knows he is being strategically disingenuous. And because he clearly isn't doing it out of the goodness of his heart because he cares about all the little people, the question is why he would do it at all, and with such seeming urgency, especially with him being this big elephant gun, and Bitcoin being--in his eyes--just a tiny gnat... Could he feel like his window of opportunity to stop Bitcoin before it gets too big  is somehow shrinking? If so, then I think he's right about *one* thing.

One irony of bankers' knee-jerk rancor about the cryptocurrency space is that if, as a result, they were to someday declare full-scale war on conversion to fiat, they might, as you hope, discover that their ultimatum pounds the last nail in the coffin of the argument against BTC (and/or some successor) as a viable medium of exchange in its own right.

I'm saying the facts don't bear out either interpretation. For instance, the last major action China took detrimental to Bitcoin was to pressure Chinese exchanges into declaring a moratorium on BTC withdrawals back in February. During the period of that moratorium it may have impeded Chinese-based speculators/investors, but it didn't hurt BTC, which rose in price from $1200 to $2400 by the time China exchanges lifted the moratorium about 3 months later.

Not wrong, just incomplete. The vast majority of recent China discussion seems to assume demand across the rest of the world is static, though every bit of available evidence shows it's anything but. Coinbase, as an extremely popular point of entry is a case in point--they can't keep up with demand. Or consider the mushrooming trade volumes at non-Chinese CC exchanges. Also factor in the possibility that continuing availability of P2P/OTC trading in China plus increased porosity of the Great Firewall of China through VPN/TOR/crypto-fintech/etc. will mitigate against declines in demand within China. Don't have any idea how much these things help tip the balance back the other way, but some, and I would say not negligibly.

*"To say 'Yes' means to support someone who really wants to import an unlimited number. That's why we must work hard to refuse every single migrant – given Merkel's and similar people's plans, a single migrant is way too big a step towards infinity and national suicide...
"At some moment, Germany – well, the country may already be called 'al Mania' to make it more Arabic – will become such an existential threat for relatively sane neighbors such as Czechia that we will have to build some coalition and either beat Germany and turn it into a safe neighbor again, or risk that the Western civilization will cease to exist on the European continent."*

I don't consider BTC, with all it promises and portends even now, to be an "endgame" conception. I.e., to my mind "There is no 'there' there," because by the time we reach "there," the landscape will look entirely different from what we can currently see from the low, limited vista of the present. IOW, I strongly suspect that not only will BTC's value shift radically; so, too, will its functions and roles within the monetary ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:30:50
Even for the extreme-risk environment of BTC/CC trading, feels like a tipping point resting on a razor's edge. If the next couple hits of big news are good, champage cork. If bad, Humpty Dumpty.

And of course, as that article (finally) notes near the very end, the dot com inflation-adjusted market cap at the peak of the bubble was over $4 *trillion*, (actually closer to $4.33 trillion), compared to current crypto/blockchain market cap of ~$172 billion - roughly half of just the .33 trillion correction I tacked on above.  
Further, even at its nadir following the bust, dot com market cap was *still* at $1.75 trillion in inflation-adjusted dollars - which, if applied to cryptos, would "burst" its market cap all the way back down to about $69.5 billion - where it hasn't stood since the Olden Days of...late May 2017?! Somehow I think we could weather *that* storm... 
All of which says to me that - as many have already observed, and extreme volatility notwithstanding (in fact, I view extreme volatility as a more forceful argument for a nascent-market interpretation than for an irrationally exuberant bubble-market interpretation) - the data suggest we're just getting going here...

From r/Cryptocurrency: 
Presuming BTC reaches (or has reached!) some tipping point in the direction toward adoption, damping of volatility can reasonably be expected to serve as both a harbinger and a consequence. Should that be the case, BTC's dual function as a medium of exchange and a store of value could, throughout whatever duration this next "phase" persists, conceivably produce a price dynamic dominated by oscillations between stable and increasing values. Or, IOW, it's not impossible that [TL;DR] for a while, at least, BTC market pricing might follow a trajectory of price plateaus punctuated by sudden spikes upward--i.e. Stable *=* Dip could become the New Normal!
