I'm in a similar situation. At the end of October i got a job doing research and marketing for an ICO, without much previous knowledge of the industry it was very overwhelming but working here and reading about different blockchain-projects everyday got me really interested in the market and in blockchain technology.
Then my girlfriend for four years left me and I felt that the light in my life was over so i decided to put in a little in different alts because I had nothing to loose and was starting to get a feel of the industry, the potential and what projects was promising. 
Not only did it work as a distraction, it also got me way more involved with my work and now I'm actually looking forward to wake up and go to work in the morning.
Now as I said earlier I put in to different alts, not bitcoin, and I haven't bought any bitcoin since then either. 
I made some profit but it would have been so much more if I put everything (or just a part of it) in to BTC. 
Now my point is that even when my investments has gone down a lot (like these past two days), or I made really shitty day-trading decisions it still worked great as a distraction from the pain I felt after the break up. In a way it works better because all I can do is panicking over the profits I'm losing and losing money is nothing compared to losing a life partner.
I'm so glad that you have found a way of dealing with the inevitable anxiety you get after a longterm-relationship has ended and don't worry about losing your investments, this distraction has been worth the money in the end anyway!
Also if you need someone to talk to who's in a similar situation and knows how hopeless it can feel then feel free to contact me and I will listen and support you best I can!
