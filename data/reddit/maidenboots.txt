Is this where a Dogecoin circlejerk starts?  
But in all seriousness, there is almost no point arguing whether or not Bitcoin will succeed in the long run. The only thing that will truly answer that question is time.

Currently it is at 20 people. If none of them are lying, those 20 people control 20+% of all BTC that will ever be mined.

I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal. The numbers don't lie. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:54:30
This is my problem right not. I'm thinking of investing ~50% now and saving the other 50% for a few weeks from now.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:54:28
I am aware of this. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:14:58
The community is what it has. Over here we are serious about almost everything and it's daunting to newcomers. Also, because of the mining infrastructure, it is almost impossible to get coins without spending money. If I was new, I would probably go for an alt-coin because it is easier to get into and the community is more supportive/fun loving.

Thank you kind sir!

I have tried this to no avail.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:05:44
Nope, I am only human. But I also want to make the most out of my current money. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:01:16
This is my conflict right now :p

Not planning on selling and not buying back :)

This is the truth.....

Its only made ~$500 swing in a 24 hour period :p
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:53:19
Although I am trying to incite community discussion about the topic.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:08:54
.02 bitches :) CPU mining FTW!
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:00:46
No I've been watching to market for ~a year at this point and finally have the money to invest, but I don't want to invest a few hundred today and have the price of BTC fall by say half in 2 weeks.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:49:28
No one cares about it? 
Hmmm has been one of the fastest growing subreddits recently. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:08:14
Coinbase is fine for me. I just refreshed the page a second ago. $701/BTC
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:46:56
Well it took what. A day to go from $525 to $1000. Now were back to $600. I'll take a guess that its going to settle back to ~$500?
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:29:36
I manually blocked it using adblock.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:47:29
Still, if I buy .5 BTC for ~$350 today and next week thats a whole BTC im gonna be pissed. 
But I see where you are going with this. Although I still wonder whether or not to wait it out for a couple more weeks...

Are there any reputable exchanges that will allow "instant" trading from BTC to fiat?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:48:45
I was originally looking at buying at $90. I'm kicking myself in the ass right now for not :p
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:56:59
Because the community is more supportive and honestly is it more appealing to get 15000 of something or .05 of something else for the same price?
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:43:20
The suicide hotline might be true if most people had more than ~5-10 bucks worth.

Live in the US. I try not to get too hyped just in case of a failure.

Around .02 from CPU mining 8 months ago. (Nvidia GPU :p)
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:47:34
I see it though less as a currency and more as an introduction to crypto currency as a whole. It feels good to mine for a few hours and have ~100 coins and I see it as a gateway to more "serious" currencies. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:12:05
I know this, but put yourself in the place of a newcomer. 5000 doge a day mining, or .01 in 6 months....maybe?

Personally, I've invested in BTC but have been mining Doge for the Lols and to get a feel for the mining process, which is hard for BTC due to insane difficulty.
