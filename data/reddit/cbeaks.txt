Do you write for the Daily Mail?


Where's your evidence for this?

I feel like I'm going around in circles here, so I'll try one more time.  There were huge delays in getting dollar withdrawals.  Nobody was having any issues trying to transfer out BTC and their coins not being there.  The issue was payment processing and yes some people wondered if their money (fiat) had been misappropriated. I was not aware of anyone being concerned about bitcoins being taken.  But the issue, coming about 5 months after this video, involved bitcoins being stolen (hence BTC *not* fiat solvency) then caused the exchange to collapse and people (me included) to lose our BTC.

How do we donate?  I clicked the donate button on their website but nothing happened.

You think the punishment fit the crime?  Just because there are worse injustices in the world doesn't make this one OK.

having watched it again recently I noticed two things: he was referring to issues around fiat withdrawals that related to limits placed on mt. gox by their bank and this happened a few months before issues around btc solvency emerged.  I'm not a Roger fan boy here, just trying to stay factual.

This is simple.  The answer is government.  No one can stop bitcoin but a strong push from government would sure slow down adoption.  If they made it illegal across all the developed markets it would significantly reduce the number of people who would trust it as a store of value.
I think we often lose sight of this when we attack the shitcoins.  Those can be beaten by competition fair and square, but governments can play dirty.  Very dirty.

I've watched the video and he doesn't mention solvency once.

I thought the lightening network was taking on the debit cards?

I agree with you that his intent was to infer solvency, but it was specific to *fiat* solvency. The issues with BTC solvency came some time later and at the time of the video was not of concern by all of us using Mt. Gox.  So we weren't seeking assurance that our bitcoins were safe, we were worried we couldn't get our fiat out.

This article is almost a month old?

The joke's on you as you obviously don't get it.

It did a bit apparently

So sad.  RIP miners.  Thoughts go out to their pools.

This.  
This is getting into "Burn the witch!!" territory.

It's the same when you stay in hotels and they 'invite' you to re-use your sheets to save the planet . . . and their laundry costs.

Is this meant to be funny?

Denying regulation is going to hit Bitcoin's eco system is delusional. Sure, no one knows how to regulate a blockchain that's decentralized (at least yet); but they do know how to regulate the hell out of everything that touches it.  That means business.  And business isn't going to be prepared to gamble operating outside of the regulators' directions for fear of losing licenses or being fined.  
So that leaves us 2 options:
1. Government regulation
2. Self regulation
Self regulation is the way to go.  We set the agenda, not government.  All industries facing regulatory pressure start by trying to convince the government they can regulate themselves.  This is what we should be doing.  Bitcoin has regulation built into the code.  We are already part of the way there.  There are, however, significant gaps that need to be addressed for us to present a credible case to the regulators across the world.  
If we don't get on the front foot on this, the agenda will be set for us, and it won't be pretty.

You are perhaps underestimating the influence (whale) traders can have on the market.  Remember market manipulation is not illegal in the crypto markets.  Add the fact that it's volatile as hell and has tiny liquidity compared to other markets.  Price is not just perceived value but a slew of other things going on too.

Because they can receive a return greater than the inflation rate?

Soon you'll be saying fiat is good after all we should settle that over lightning.
