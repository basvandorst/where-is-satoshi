It's funny that people even believe that the parties are separate it's all one nation under $ politicians don't give a fuck what voters say it's all about who pays more but one thing is clear it's not the constituents it's the companies what really funny is that laws even have to be passed that say companies can't do shit that kills it hurts people I mean come if you knew a person who enjoyed stabbing people to death but would never be jailed or even arrested wouldn't you at least be slightly afraid for your life and stop dealing with that person
