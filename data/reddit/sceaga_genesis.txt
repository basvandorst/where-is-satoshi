Better than coffee, I just check the price when I wake up

Like a song I haven’t heard in a while, I find this clip every few years and it has me in stitches. Never disappoints!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:35
Awww yeeah 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:48:41
I’ve also heard “Bitslot”
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:03:45
Ah, Memory Lane...

Short the status quo
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:56:43
There’s a lot of certainty and trepidation in his statements. He doesn’t sound like someone just brushing off bitcoin casually, and I’d almost rather look at rollercoaster memes just to feel better.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:45:47
Was wondering the same thing 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:12:35
Good work!
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:20:54
Give me more of this
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:11:20
I love how Katie Couric calls out to “Alison” like she’s Alexa or Google Home haha
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:52:59
It strikes me as more FUD. If they keep saying the same thing, someone will believe them. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:22:30
I laugh every single time
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:50:12
Hold my beer... while I pontificate about crypto
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:37:02
What is automobile. Anyone know what automobile is? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:34:49
So Ronnie Moss is a lurker here?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:09:45
Hey Peter man, turn on channel 9, man
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:12:29
Interesting then that you’re looking at new posts on this sub, but hey, I welcome another perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:33:50
Well... I can imagine that
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:56:10
It certainly seems like bonus money might fall into the “don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose” category.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:38:21
“In Russia, coin regulate you”
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:41:57
He’s in the minors 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:43:21
Who’s coming with me??
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:14:43
That makes 3 of us
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:06:04
Unless there already is one! Their 90’s fashion kills me.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:53:27
Winkle attack lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:53
Now give the man some space
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:02
How difficult is it to mine litecoin at this point?
@_date: 2019-02-08 03:04:00
Yeah why
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:03:24
I️ don’t understand why this man is still allowed screen time
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:48:54
Putin is the world’s richest man...
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:26:55
Oh, is it time to get out then?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:09:21
I’ve previously been scolded for saying this, but THIS
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:16:23
For why?
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:38:21
There’s another lode of documents that just became public that are being called the “Paradise Papers”
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:29:17
Guy poor
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:46:39
Like completely? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:17:42
Is he saying “fart loudly”?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:27:57
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:05:58
You hodl onto your butt and buy the dip. That’s how this works.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:59:32
This is similar to what I would say, but for me, even more than an investment, it’s a vote of confidence in the technology. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:48:30
This is a good way to stress out immediately haha
I opened this post and was immediately flooded with anxiety.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:39:24
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:06:40
Thirded 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:27
I was solely asking for your reasoning, but I appreciate your closing remark.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:54:51
Ahhhhhhhahahahahahahahahaha - what did the five fingers say to the face? SLAP
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:26:18
2 minutes of that sub makes me want to punch the neighborhood bully from my childhood
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:39:52
Sweet, thanks for the reading material!
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:12:16
I just finished “Digital Gold” and it was great for learning about notable moments in Bitcoin’s history
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:40:31
Good on you for buying a rental property!
