 I thing wrong with qr codes those are quick! Unfortunately bitcoin is rather slow to conform transactions which is why most altcoins are focused on speed of transaction. I’ve watched videos of people paying for coffee and such on the bitcoin lighting network or dash. The had a tablet based pos system and the customer opens their wallet,scans the code and the transaction is done, confirmed right there. 
I actually just got my raspberry pi today. I’m building a lighting node and making a website to connect merchants and crypto enthusiasts and hopefully transform the way we transact in our local economy!

So the product is just a website/forum type deal. It is an approachable platform for the average consumer to learn about crypto, how to get it, and function as a type of news outlet/ bulletin for consumers and merchants alike. It’s all about connecting people and rolling out the red carpet for crypto in the Merrimack valley!
The site is a mess right now as I just bought the domain the other day and have had little time to work on it since. Feel free to check it out of you have time, merrimackvalleycrypto.com there isn’t much posted on there but you can subscribe to our mailing list or join the forum section.

I’m a millennial and absolutely love bitcoin. Not because it’s going to make me rich but because it is sound money and affords me financial sovereignty.

I’m working on a networking site and forum to connect crypto enthusiasts and merchants in my area. I’m just about to launch my bitcoin lightning node but that’s a little too complicated for the average joe and has some drawbacks. There are other coins better suited for fast transactions but we lack a Point of sale system for retail and restaurants. I love crypto and want to see mass adoption but it’s going to take a lot of work to make this easy enough for he average joe, well get there though! To the moon �� ������

Amen sista, be your own bank! Cannot wait until the day I can pay at kiosks with bitcoin lightning, anywhere in the world, without exchange fees, and without having to ask my banks permission.  
As far as business owners go, I would love to see them all on their own btcpay servers! I know I'm pushing hard for it in my area, trying to spread lightning adoption with local merchants. This is for the mutual benefit of everyone in the community. Very excited to see what the next 5 years or so hold for crypto, especially pertaining to retail adoption and ease of use.

Sure, it's merrimackvalleycrypto.com . Honestly its basically nothing published at the moment and I have re written most of the stuff that is up, but have just not published yet. You can however sign up for the the newsletter to check back later or register for the forum section.
Honestly it's not really worth showing at the moment. I have very little free time between school and 2 jobs. I'm hoping to add the content I have made offline and be able to actually launch sometime next month.
@_date: 2019-10-10 14:55:56
Absolutely it has everything Coinbase pro has and much more. You can trade on margin too if you know what you’re doing. I tried to play the day trader but I suck, so now I just HODL. 
As far as the FDIC goes, that’s comforting if you intend to hold fiat on the exchange for an extended period of time. Do yourself a favor and just turn it all into BTC and move it on to a hardware wallet ��.
@_date: 2019-10-10 12:24:42
Gotta get on kraken my dude! I made the switch from Coinbase Pro a few months ago and never looked back.   But the benefits aren’t limited to just lower fees, they are the industry leaders in exchange security.
@_date: 2019-10-08 12:17:54
Thank you for taking the time to reply and offering advice. Right now I am pretty active in the Raspiblitz Telegram group and Zap Slack channel. I am not really contributing anything of great value yet. I am merely lurking, learning and helping other noobs if I am able. 
I have to say that the Bitcoin community has been overwhelmingly helpful with any errors I have run into.  What I am consistently seeing is that networking and opensource projects are my most likely way into the space, and it certainly makes sense. As I become more proficent in relevant programming languages, I hope to become of more value to the community and eventually find myself in a career I love.
Again, thank you for your advice and I hope we cross paths on some project in the future!
@_date: 2019-10-08 12:10:12

No I’m from the U.S. , kraken charges a $5 deposit fee for usd and a withdrawal fee of .0005 btc.
Bank of America charges $30 I think ? for same day wire transfer. $10 for overnight and $3 for 3 day. 
Kraken is always lightning fast with depos into my account. I usually do an overnight transfer and it is in my kraken account ready to spend by noon EST
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:09:06

People from paxful paying me for bitcoin. Simply writing bitcoin is enough to get banned I guess.
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:42:58
Only the opening and closing of a channel is published to the blockchain. But you can make channels private so they are not visible to lightning network explorers. Within that channel you can transact back and forth privately and then close the channel which would publish the latest state of the channel.
@_date: 2019-09-08 18:19:33
No you’re absolutely right about that. I’ve been running a node for a couple of weeks and haven’t routed a single payment. Lightning is still in its infancy, but I have high hopes for its potential to scale bitcoin. 
Setting it up and playing with the wallets is a lot of fun. I’ve bought a few things as well. Connecting with a lot of really cool people as well. 
Check out the raspiblitz tutorial on GitHub. Everyone is very helpful around pretty much anywhere lightning is being talked about.
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:34:07
Yeah they are very helpful on the slack channel. I actually originally posted for help on Reddit, and Jack Maller himself (the creator of zap) invited me to check out the slack channel. Really cool/helpful group of people over there. Can't wait to see where the LN and Zap are in a few years!

@_date: 2019-09-14 01:46:59
Let’s stick to comparing apples to apples. I’m suggesting exploring this instead of the more traditional investment vehicles. But if regular old HODLing is your thing, that’s cool too! Being your own bank is one of my favorite things about bitcoin. But I’m willing to sacrifice some of that freedom in return for passive income
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:21:57
Now time to run a lightning node off the same machine. LND is easy to install!
@_date: 2019-09-29 21:04:35
Cashapp probably is your best bet? Coinbase as well but I can’t direct you there in good conscience...
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:48:51
I had already cashed out but I hear stories of them holding onto it on other situations.
@_date: 2019-09-14 01:20:49
I'm still on board. I do enjoy the sovereignty that bitcoin can provide, I'm willing to sacrifice some of that to earn more. I wouldn't go all in on it, but definitely worth checking out now that you don't need to invest 5k minimum. I think most investment vehicles require you asking politely to withdraw money.
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:32:16
Posted about this last night and people flipped out. I think it’s a great idea. apparently they are not fans of compounding interest And new business opportunities in the crypto market...

@_date: 2019-09-05 11:24:33
Yes I get that error everywhere. No the node is correctly configured with dynamicDNS. And yes they have been very helpful over there I’m going to try and fix it this morning and I’ll report back!
@_date: 2019-09-09 00:57:23
@_date: 2019-09-20 01:30:00
It’s meant to be an exchange between friends, unless that exchange is for a good or service...basically they are owned by PayPal and PayPal charges a fee for such transactions, so they are just looking out for themselves.
@_date: 2019-09-14 01:54:03
Ouch I think that’s a little unfair. Different strokes for different folks my dude.
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:56:55
So the issue ended up being incorrect lndconnect parameters. I was pasting the lndconnect results from my node with my external ip address. At the directon of one of the slack members, I simply replaced that with my local ip and bam working again. Feel a little stupid though lol. Anyway problem solved.
The best apart about the mobile wallet is that I can easily explain LN to my non-coiner friends, and be able to show them just how easy it is to use. The UX/UI is much more approachable than say ssh, which is further than the average Joe is willing to go.
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:45:15
I also run my node on TOR for added security. If you use your public IP address for your node, then those transactions would be tied to your IP address.
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:34:41
So far I have loved it. I have run into a bit of a problem, probably of my own doing. I’ve taken my problem over to their slack channel and people are helping me to fix it. The issue is basically that I’m stuck in the my wallets page of the app. Likely due to a corrupted file or some error I made while playing around with lnd configuration. 
I’m testing out auto pilot now, it seems ok so far. It has been opening up channels for me with both local and remote balances. I haven’t routed any payments yet. Hopefully as we grow and the need for lightning grows, that will change!
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:57:31
 I think we have a long way to go though before bitcoin becomes a unit of account. But we will get there!
@_date: 2019-09-14 01:40:41
I’m just going off the advice of a friend that has been using them and very pleased with the arrangement. They are much more qualified to be giving investment advice than myself. I’m on the technical side, but willing to explore some new options.
@_date: 2019-09-14 01:14:21
This isn't for everyone and Bitcoin means something different to each individual. I am willing to sacrifice the above mentioned for the potential reward.
@_date: 2019-09-14 02:45:51
Yeah because they are giving out loans annd investing with that. Creating opportunities and hopefully encouraging new investors into crypto.  instead of using fiat, you use crypto. 
Like it or not, banks and financial institutions play an important role in our economy. I'm all for exploring the benefits it could potentially bring not just for myself. But there is nothing wrong with just HODLing either, were all in different situations.
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:04:33
