Hello, I just wanted to share some worries : 
Is it legal to print such a huge amount of a currency like USDT is currently doing when you are able to adjust the supply to USD real value? I mean when you claim something to worth 1 USD and when u have a way to stabilize it around this value, what makes it really different from claiming it is real USD?
Then you make profit on the USD real value in real life and on the fact that you found a way to print as much USD you want... You are not anyway selling a concurrency technology aiming to grow in value anymore but you are making and selling freely a fiat currency and I am not sure it is legit.
For me it looks like counterfeit currency making -&gt; no USD value at all
Moreover it is for them really easy to get attention, they just print more and more USDT to be highly ranked on CMC... 
**-&gt; market cap = value * supply**
Here :
supply = almost infinity
value = ~~1 USD~~ 0 USD
While they keep adjusting the price to 1USD, they abuse people mind as only few of holders would be able to cash back at 1USD.
I would be really happy to have your opinion on that, or if your share the same doubts just say it please.
My bests.
