Glad I pulled my money out yesterday :P Still going to keep using it with the new security. I have it set to cash out on every coin anyway so they can't steal very much.

Have you got Flash open in a browser tab? My GPU gets underclocked whenever I go on Youtube, which drops my Mhash to about 50%.

Weird, my 5850 Toxic only gets 284Mhash but Deepbit says I'm getting like 340MHash.

What's the advantage of this over Deepbit?

Do we really need to have a circlejerk every time a post hits the front page about somebody getting ripped off by a payment processor/bank/whatever? "Bitcoin is decentralised and this wouldn't have happened if they'd used it instead". We get it. Now just shut up about it and post news that actually involves Bitcoin.

I had the same transaction go through twice and put me into negative dollars at one point. I wouldn't have been surprised if this turned out to be a legit bug.

Mine was cracked. Some jeb-end tried to access my gmail account. Wrong password for the account, and I've got 2-Factor turned on anyway.
9 character password, 8 lowercase, 1 number, not a dictionary word. Someone is cracking them bloody fast.

Because it really isn't that simple.

Good luck with that.
