Hmm, are you in the US?
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:54:28
What.. cash app has no withdrawal fees or purchasing fees and their over market price is balanced out by the purchasing fee other exchanges charge, who told you they charge withdrawal fees!?
@_date: 2019-07-19 20:49:38
Yeah I just meant he should see a profit in at least a few months, should’ve clarified, my bad.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:22:29
How do you get coinbase to show those stats? My coinbase only shows the first 3 stats.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:47:26
No problem! Just FYI the debit card method charges higher fees so if you’re gonna be holding onto your purchase for a while it’s better to just purchase via bank transfer and wait for the funds to clear.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:45:05
Woops I forgot to reply directly to you but i just answered your ? In a different comment.
@_date: 2019-07-19 19:01:27
Just ignore that other idiot. If you’re trying to gradually grow your portfolio then yes, it’s a good strategy.
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:07:18
cash app
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:44:26
As far as I know, it doesn’t make a difference. If you purchase a stable coin or directly deposit USD you still need to wait for it to clear. Only way to instantly purchase is using a debit card I believe. You can buy/sell ON coinbase immediately after depositing money but you cannot withdraw it until the funds have cleared.
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:36:03
I personally haven’t but it’s so convenient just with the not having to wait alone that even if was paying a few dollars more it’d be worth it to me. Other guy needs to quit spreading misinformation about fees smh.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:32:50
That’s weird, not sure why it isn’t showing for me. Thanks though!
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:22:16
You were wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:59:41
For real LMAO ������
@_date: 2019-07-17 02:33:06
Yeah he/she has... hopefully they continue to be right lol
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:11:55
No I didn’t have any luck :( sorry
@_date: 2019-07-19 20:49:03
Seriously tho lmao
@_date: 2019-07-19 19:02:38
However just be willing to hold long term (couple months minimum) and don’t stress over day-to-day or even week-to-week prices
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:38:58
Yeah you can directly deposit USD to coinbase and store it there to buy in whenever you’d like or you can also purchase some of their stable coins and use that to buy bitcoin at a later date.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:29:10
Yeah I am logged in but I’m doing it on the mobile app, not the site. I’ll try the site when I get home I guess.
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:22:25
At least make more of an effort when you’re trying to get handouts smh 
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:42:15
I’m not in a position to offer you any advice on that subject, especially when it comes to crypto. I would recommend doing a lot lot lot more research before you start asking those questions. I myself spent about 3-4 months researching before I put any money into it and I come from an IT background to put into perspective how much you should research.
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:34:25
To expand on this, if you bought 1 bitcoin now at its current value ~7.5k USD and held it for a year, and then it’s value changed to 20k USD, you would cash out and get 20k USD (minus fee as I said) and when Uncle Sam checks your taxes for the year they are expecting you to pay capital gains on that 12.5k profit you just made. Not sure where you’re located or your tax laws but yeah that’s the gist of it.
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:31:52
When you get 1 bitcoin you can sell it for whatever price bitcoin is valued at against USD at that time. So if you want to cash out in a year and bitcoin is worth 20k and you have 1 bitcoin, you can sell it for that 20k minus fees (and capital gains tax depending on price entry point of bitcoin). If bitcoin is valued at 0 USD in a year, you would get 0 dollars at that point.

Happy late Thanksgiving everyone!

Bitcoin halvening will do nothing for your current bitcoin holdings (except hopefully provide an increase in value since it is going to become more difficult to obtain in a sense). 
The bitcoin halvening refers to a reduction in rewarding bitcoin to miners who verify transactions. If you research bitcoin mining it will help provide more clarity on the mining process and how block rewards work. 
Feel free to DM with additional questions!

Won’t be donating but best of luck 
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:09:30
I was curious and decided to explore the dark net, saw bitcoin was a thing, and was not very smart for not buying at the time lol.

I think it means out of your 0.0068 bitcoin, 0.0061335 won’t be available to withdraw until the 7th. It’s standard practice on some exchanges to allow you to buy instantly but not be able to withdraw/exchange. Cash app allows you to instantly buy and transfer so consider that if you want immediate access to your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-18 18:23:44
That’s because you’re looking at it sitting at 6-7k as a “drop” in price relative to whatever its price was at a specific point in time that you’re comparing against. Yeah you can look at bitcoin and say “it dropped from 20k to 6800 it’s not going anywhere”. But if you change your perspective and say “holy shit bitcoin has gone from cents to 6800 in a decade” or “wow bitcoin is up 100% from a low of 3k to 6k in a year”, well then you can see why people are bullish. Actually there was a CNN article recently that named bitcoin as the best growing investment of the decade let me see if I can find it.
Edit: 
here is the article 
Edit 2: 
I’m not implying that any of the people saying “bitcoin will be 100k or 1m a coin” are making valid claims, but I can see WHY they’re bullish.

I know that Coinbase does that where you can set recurring purchases for x amount but I’m not familiar with anywhere else
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:43:45
Historically for myself, I usually bought in when prices went up, and they always went back down shortly after ���� ultimately best thing to do is average in long term rather than waiting for specific price fluctuations
