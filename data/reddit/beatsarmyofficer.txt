@_date: 2017-11-29 06:53:07

@_date: 2019-04-10 07:37:21

@_date: 2019-04-21 17:01:09

@_date: 2018-11-04 22:39:54
Institutions won’t be able to buy from bakkt till December aka no price movement
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:16:54

@_date: 2019-01-02 00:33:10
@_date: 2018-11-03 08:51:08
Well....Now I know that you don’t know what you’re talking about��
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:16:44
Prepare for a dip because bitcoin’s value is gonna split between bitcoin and the new coin 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:39:18
That’s what happened at the BCH fork. A coin can’t keep the same value if it splits 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:11:44
I’m just posting what coinbase posted on their website
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:49:03
Just wait until there’s no bitcoin left to mine. TOTAL MAYHEM!!��
@_date: 2019-05-13 09:39:52
Yes it does, because first of all your talking about the BTC pumping theories and then you start
Talking about ETF’s, claiming it to be the ETF’s
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:58:11
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:23:32
Here we go again. 
Another young redditor making claims that don’t make sense -.-
@_date: 2019-05-13 09:31:01
First of all: nobody likes to take advice or adhere to the post of young redditors, because it just shows how inexperienced they are.
Second: how many times have people used the same excuse, claiming that the rise is because of the “Bitcoin ETF”. Everybody is tired of hearing that BS. We want facts so we can factcheck that s*** and not claims based on “I believe.....”. We want the basis of your research.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:28:49
Redditor for 3 days hahahahaha
Somebody come take HIM away please!
@_date: 2018-12-22 08:59:10
Somebody come take this 7 week old peasant away -_-
