Our first replies are going out this week. Hold tight!

No deadline. We have a rolling application window. We'll continue taking applications until all the spots are filled.

It was announced here: r/ . Follow  for all the latest news on our residencies.
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:39:18
Good luck!
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:03:43
Apply anyway. You might be surprised!

I'd love to provide screenshots. Sadly, I was kicked from the btc1 slack when I said that no-one should run jgarzik's untested and unreviewed code.
He did indeed tell me that uninitialized class bools would be default-constructed to false. When I pointed out to him that if that were so, then the mining code would never produce a base block size &gt;1MB, he pushed out his patch.

To be clear, 5 cents might be possible if:
* you're prepared to wait for 24 hours (but if you don't get confirmed, you can always RBF fee bump)
* you're using segwit
* you're batching several transactions
The main idea I was trying to convey was that you can't really *tldr* this stuff. Different users have different needs which call for different fee strategies. Suggesting $10.17 is *the* transaction fee is inaccurate, and suggesting 5c is *the* transaction fee is just as inaccurate.
It's complicated, and especially confusing for new users, which is why we should speak up when we see tweets like Erik's which could mislead people. Numbers can obfuscate as well as clarify, and I felt like Erik's tweet was more obfuscating than clarifying.

... and it's a shitty move to point to the small print. Most of the places with minimums are small scale mom and pop stores whose margins get wiped out by visa/mastercard fees and chargebacks. If you don't want to pay cash, don't shop there.

We're looking for residents who are going to make impactful contributions to Bitcoin/Lightning open source projects going forward. There are many interpretations of what that could mean, but we're looking for people who have strong technical skills and a vision of how they could continue using the experience they gain here after the residency.
If you want to learn more about the technical details of Bitcoin, Lighting Network, and related technologies, and are excited to spend your summer writing code and contributing to open-source projects, then you should apply!
We're looking for around 10 residents.

Definitely! We timed the residency so that it would be during summer break for students.

Hi, my name's John Newbery. I've been contributing to Bitcoin Core for just over a year. If I wanted to work on a different project, I could do that. There's nothing compelling me to continue work on this particular project.
My decision to work on a specific open source project is based on a number of factors:
1. do the aims of the project align with my own beliefs and interests?
2. is the technology interesting?
3. am I working with the best people in the world? (in other words, am I learning from the best)
4. do I like the management and processes of the project?
For Bitcoin Core, the answer to all of those things is an emphatic yes:
1. The Bitcoin Core ideals of decentralization and user choice are very important to me
2. Bitcoin Core has the best and most interesting technology (for example I wrote a series of articles documenting just some of the changes in v0.15 starting here:  The pace of change and the amount of innovation coming out of Bitcoin Core is, I believe, unmatched in any other project in the cryptocurrency space.
3. I find contributors like Pieter Wuille, Greg Maxwell, Andrew Poelstra, Wladimir van der Laan, Cory Fields, Matt Corallo, Alex Morcos and many others inspiring to work with, and am constantly learning from them.
4. Bitcoin Core strives to be an open meritocracy. Decisions are made in public and all IRC meetings and code reviews are available for all to see.
btc1, not so much:
1. Decisions are made by a group of companies behind closed doors and then presented to the community as a fait accompli.
2. The btc1 repo is a fork of Bitcoin Core with some modifications. There is no innovation or interesting new technology in the btc1 repo. All of the good stuff is derived from the upstream source.
3. As far as I'm aware, the only active maintainer on btc1 is Jeff Garzik. I have nothing against Jeff personally and I'm sure he's a smart enough guy, but I don't consider him to be in the same league as Pieter, Greg, Matt, et al.
4. The decision making on btc1 technical issues often seems to be done in private or back channels, and then a declaration is made on the github issue or PR. I don't see any transparency in the decision making process.
So to answer your question, I very much doubt that I'll work on btc1 after November, whatever the share of hash rate that it takes. I'll find a project that aligns better with my beliefs.

I'm coordinating this program with Feel free to ask any questions here or tweet me

None taken! I still have plenty to learn about Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core myself, so it's a good question. I'm not sure if 'qualified' is the right word, but here are some of my experiences over the last 12 months:
- contributing to Bitcoin Core: 
- writing technical posts about Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core: 
- delivering training at  and 
As Matt says, this is a joint effort from the entire Chaincode team. I'm co-ordinating the second session, but individual talks will be led by all of the Chaincode staff.

Why debase your arguments with petty name-calling?
