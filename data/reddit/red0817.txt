I am not a rich man, but I support what I can.  I try to help those that need, those that support a moral do unto others country.  The abolition of the 'war on drugs' policy is one of the first steps.  Good luck friend.  +all doge

I traded a VERY small amount this past week, and requested a check (cheque).  I wasn't sure if I did it correctly, and I was responded to almost immediately.    As long as the service stays personal, I'm hooked.   Being an impersonal company is what leads me (and a lot of other people) away from places like Gox.

Simple question, are you a felon, and if not, why not, and if so, why?
to qualify this:  Pot is illegal.   And there a lot of 'common sense' laws that make shit felonies, so, if you think pot should be legal, have you used it, and how did you not get caught?
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:39:24
Hah.  Didn't actually expect a reply.  Thank you for that.  I will expand upon my reasoning.  This will be a fuck all long reply.  Sorry for that.  


Not in the least.  I am suggesting those that are considered felons shouldn't be.  And for those, what do you suggest is the proper solution?  You didn't get caught, but many others did.  Had you been caught, you would be the same boat as them, aka, screwed.  Your chances of being elected would be horribly diminished, to the point of being almost non existent.  So, to continue on that line of thought, for those that have been convicted, that are considered felons for doing the same things as you, do you think they should be able to run for office, and more importantly, have a good chance at being elected?  


If you didn't admit to it, you'd be an asshole at best.  You would be not worth my, out of jurisdiction admittedly, support.   So by admitting to it, you have obviously gained my, again out of jurisdiction, support.   


I apologize for that.  The intention was to throw it out there with an expectation of interest in your thoughts.   By supporting illegal activities (i.e. mary jane), you are supporting felonies.  If you are a felon, it would make my line of questioning even more interesting, but because you are not, so my thoughts are kind of limited.   
That all being said, it is interesting to see a politician willing to speak against felonies in regards to marijuana.  You may want to see my recent post in in regards to this, as your post inspired me to ask.

Don't be depressed about it, unless you need that $2700 right now.  I mined for a few days back when it was $50.  I forgot about it, then came back to notice that it was @ 800.  And kicked myself in the nuts for not keep going.  Never again.  Yeah, don't invest what you can't afford to lose is what they say, but I feel a better term would be:  Don't invest money that you need short term.  Think long term, and you should be fine.

I don't want to sound like an ass, but I will.  As an app developer, the only way to access your account via an app (think Android app) is by using the API keys.  There is no easy way to ensure that any particular app isn't going to steal your api keys, unless you write the program yourself.  Being an app developer, and knowing this it's disconcerting to say the least.  If I were a malicious person, well, I am malicious on occasion, so, if I were a MORE malicious person, I could easily pop out an app within a week and be guaranteed to have hundreds if not thousands of api keys to pick and choose from.  This goes for basically any trading site, i.e. cryptsy, coinbase, VOA, etc.   
SIDE NOTE::  VOA allows you to set levels of api keys, and name them, so if you were to lose money, you would be able to quickly identify the culprit app, and notify everyone.

The issue becomes paying his suppliers though.  I'm sure he COULD keep his money in bitcon, then xfer away for expenses as they are billed, but the liability currently would not satisfy his investors/stock holders.  So, safer to keep in fiat until such time as a lot of his suppliers accept btc.

I'm not disagreeing with you, but wondering out loud, on PACER I get docs for 0.10/page.... why would transcripts be any different I wonder.

The people rarely "justly decide" to enact laws.  They are enacted by legislators that have been elected.  If laws were enacted by the populace, we would have referendum ballots on every law.  Not to mention, because of the first past the line rules, most of the time, a large portion of the populace is disenfranchised by laws enacted on their behalf.

I did have a chuckle when I saw that page a while back.  If you go all the way to the last page, you will find an address (the last one) had coin sent to it, and then removed, probably as a joke.

Is there a list of the amount of address with coins in them?  Because as the amount of address holding coins goes up, the chances of finding one with coin in it go up.  The mathematical probability of finding an address with some sort of coin in it would become more advantageous as time goes on.
Now, I realize that this sub is on the homer side of things, and will deny (to their deaths) the probability of finding a private key with coin on it, but none the less, the possibility is there, regardless of the probability.
The point I'm getting to here is that the probability of 2 people having the same key, while insanely low, is still there, unlike a bank which has checks in place to ensure this thing doesn't happen.

This is my concern.  20 years ago, and I know this because I was there, a HDD bigger than a GB in a personal computer was unthinkable.  Hell, my 20MB was huge by the days standards.  My 286 flew by playing games. 2400 baud modem was the shit compared to a 300 or 600 baud.  Hell, when I was born, if you said everyone would have a computer in their house, you would be most likely writing a science fiction novel.
So when someone says 'you are way more likely to be hit by lightening 100 times in a row', I chuckle and wonder what they would say in 10, 20 or 100 years.

An interesting follow up question.  At which point does the difficulty in finding a block become harder than finding a private key?
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:41:20
seeing the high rate of inflation in the charts, I was confused as to why it hadn't seen a more steady rate of increase.   I considered that the possibility was that more people were becoming involved due to higher publicity (see skype attack), therefore prices were going to rise due to higher demand.  However, I did expect a bubble bursting eventually.  That being said, the obviously smart 'investors' with large sums of BTC had orders in place for such a market correction.  
That being said, if I had a few million to throw around, I would put in standing buy order ranging from %5 to 75% of current market value, adding sell orders at 125%-1000% of purchase prices.
