I wonder what hash rate $150k of supercomputer can get. 
I mean, obviously it's going to less than asic hardware, but still.

Good point. Reverse engineering it would be simple enough, but where's the fun in that?

I remember a story about how this guy started getting Target catalogs filled with baby stuff, and for some reason or another, he called target to complain about it. Turns out? His daughter was pregnant, (he didn't know) and the system recognized it from her purchases, even though they had barely anything to do with babies.

Programming a bootloader isn't hard, that's easyish. However, you have to reverse engineer a lot of the hardware to figure out how to build the bootloader. 
So really, it's most likely not going to happen unless someone gets paid. I should mention I'm no expert on this front, so I may be wrong.

Sadly, that's actually not too effective without a massive degausser. I think it was kjmagnets did a blog post where they ran a harddrive with a bigass magnet attached. Apparently it had no effect whatsoever- harddrives are just too good these days.
Now, thermite on the other hand..

The bootloader is basically a bit of very, very low level code that well, loads the boot. It loads the actual code into memory, runs it, ect. It's an OS for an OS.
Sometimes they handle more stuff too, like hardware checks, ect.

He used a flaw in the code (exploit) to steal other users data is how the law would interpret it.

I think its the same as a tumbler- basically a service that would use a set of wallets to do transactions, and nobody but them would know whose coins went into which wallets, so as to hide them. 
A simpler explanation would be everyone who wants to hide money puts their money in a bucket, with one person knowing who put in how much. They then allow each person to withdraw at whim however much they want, up to a limit. Now do it with multiple buckets.
At least that's my understanding.

I mean, I can't claim to know how the "bloomberg terminal" works, but a lot of these corporate systems are just webapps.

Unfortunately a screenshot isn't really proof of anything, especially considering how easy chrome's inspect element feature is to use.

Reading over the developers response to everything, it seems to me that he made malicious code incompetently than with malicious intent. Relying on client security over server security, not checking the host for remote code, and the very usage of eval to remove the client instead of any other option point towards this to me.
Either he's one of the worst malware developers, or an incompetent developer. Personally, the latter seems more likely.

Hell, why not just get them laser etched in metal.
@_date: 2016-09-26 05:17:11
Good enough point. But honestly, why not get them metal etched? Paper can get burned even inside a fireproof safe, but at those temperatures I think you have bigger problems.  [Heck, you could use a version of two-key visual crypto.](

On android? No, not really, but this attack is less prevaliant as there are many more identical phones than identical pcs.

Sir, were you trying to rob this bank?
No! It's really fucking cold, I walk into the bank, everyone looses their shit and the teller hands me a bag of money, and the next thing I know I'm here!

On a Sidenote, have you ever watched snatch/lock, stock, and two smoking barrels? You should.

That's not quite true either. If you have a piggy bank and put a quarter in every day, but then some cartel comes along and dumps a load of drug money into the pig, should you have known that they did that? Now, if it can be proven that he took money OUT of the piggy bank, then that's a whole nother story. 
But then again, it could be argued that he just took money out, and never checked the balance. But that's a bit risky.

How often does one check your cold storage? It's cold for a reason, someone could dump a bunch of bitcoin into a cold storage and you'd never know.

It's 75$ for the phone and one month, then it looks like you can buy more SIM cards for less later.

Actually, it's an interesting idea, mining by hand. I guess you COULD do it, but that's like playing the hardest lottery in existence, and having to walk up a mountain every time you wanted to play.
