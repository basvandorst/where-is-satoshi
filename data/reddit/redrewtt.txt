Since you are asking for suggestions, I belive the Red Cross can be a good thing, since they are always at the front line where it is more needed. I also would suggest that you do you research about the charities (I believe that you are doing this already)... That's very nice. Take your time and try to make a real impact with this bucks.

USA industries have been soooo able to stop counterfeit products from China... While big players of Korea where sued for "you need to have a lot of imagination to see the resemblance", China was selling copycats like if it was Christmas. Patents are pathetic.

Actually, those are pretty easy to use compared to the nuances of breaking through a enterprise VPN to watch pron. And I have seen many work colleagues hack their work networks just for pron.
