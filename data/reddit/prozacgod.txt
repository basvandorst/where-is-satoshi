And a lot of ad networks are just subsidiaries of each other. They keep aggregated database with all available information on you, even though the individual companies "don't track X" the other place does, and it's all aggregated.

Until the volatility of the market slows down, I find it would be really hard to list prices of products as fixed increments against bitcoin.  How many times a day would I have to switch up my signs, to prevent people from profiting off of my slowness.

One of the most important lessons I've learned in my life, and was recently reminded is: Always speak FOR your audience not TO them.
Talking to you local small time mechanic/wood worker/, tell him how bitcoin/blockchain allows him to escrow transactions, upfront.  Without some legal mumbo-jumbo getting in his way. 
Talking to your local investor interested in bitcoin as a stock? Explain to him the different profit splits amongst payment options, then ask him how he would find ways of exploiting this, since its "difficult" to get bitcoin in the us (asking him to impart his knowledge to you is similar to the benjamin franklin effect)
It's all about how you frame the conversation.  Also always be up to date and knowledgeable, if the bitcoin laymen can trap you into an area where you have no knowledge, then you've just allowed him to prove to you that you're wrong, and the conversation is over.

Dude... lol - do you think I could be on Reddit for as long as I have WITHOUT having read up on the constant masturbatory topics that exist on Reddit?  That would include civil asset forfeiture...  Which has been abused for a long time and the abuses have been discussed for ages.. but let me clue you in on somethings, since you obviously need to be *educated* yourself..
The whole POINT of Civil Asset Forfeiture, the intent - the well meaning reason for why it came into existence - was because of the fungibility of cash, in criminal cases cash can never be proven to have a 'history' where did it come from? how did you earn it? The law's original intent was to be able to attack large criminal organizations who were hiding cash within families and assets by buying things, like perhaps gold, or vehicles and 'possessing it' outside of the 'organized crime' therefore allowing criminals to remain rich, even if their criminal enterprises were effectively 'defunded' and dissolved.
Which in this case is ENTIRELY justified under the original premise of the rules of Civil Asset Forfeiture.... There was no over zealous application of law here, this isn't some kid driving across state lines to get a fucking surgery and his car + cash confiscated due to douche bag officers.... this is a clear cut application of a law intended to thwart criminals being able to keep criminal funds... you fucking over zealous twat... 
But hey, if you want to educate me, please feel free to do so.  I'm waiting anxiously.

which... is illegal... no misconceptions there.


Pundit much?  This is all virtue signalling, he's not the goddamned messiah, he decided he wanted money regardless of law, (this makes him a criminal) laws which A.) Take time to change, and rightfully so B.) are put in place by the voting public^1


Which was?


That's not what he was implicated in, that is definitely not what he was arrested for... 
It was money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics


You misunderstand I'm not morally invested in this. I'm trying to understand why people rationalize a criminal as a hero.  He wasn't at best he was an idealist.
Again, the laws of the state dictated his ultimate end result, it was entirely predictable.  If he was the rational individual, by which claims you've made, he would have realized that in order to get his vision to succeed he'd have to compromise, and demand that drug trades are not made on his site.  Instead he made it the trading bazaar of drugs that it was, (also, other things too, but essentially anything and everything that was illegal)  A Rational human would know that the site and its author would soon be discovered and arrested, and possibly risk the arrest of it's members.  
I'm not saying I agree with the laws, or wish him to be imprisoned.  I'm saying the end result was fucking obvious, and if he wanted to fight he could have easily chosen a better tactic.
^1 - A side note, yes before you jump on that bit - I recognize that laws are often put in place by corporations, or fucking tacked onto must-pass-funding-bills... BUT in this context the laws on the books were overwhelmingly voted for by the public (years ago). It will take years to get them removed or changed to an acceptable compromise. Social change may never happen within your lifetime, if you actually work to achieve that change, maybe your children would enjoy it.  But working to achieve the change is slow, not "build an illegal bazaar of drug trafficking, and hope for the best"

If I leave stack of cash at a drug dealers house ... and the feds confiscate it... they are in their right to do so, it is not "theft" or "stolen"  Even so, how can you prove the cash belongs to you, and would you be willing to say "hey, I didn't get my drugs, could you refund me F-Bro-I ?"
I mean they probably have records of which users deposited what amounts, but... remember part of the nature of money is "fungibility" legally it could be easily argued that you converted your coin into "silk road points" - especially if trading was done on an internal ledger and all paid BTC stuffed into their pool of BTC..  Then all BTC would be assets of Silk Road.

There's nothing stopping you from creating a similar device that does all the things this device does.  Down to the letter.
The 90% usage case is "it will already be programmed with a private key" and "it will puke up a public key so you can check the balance"
There's no way to verify that the private key has never been duplicated.
There could be 100 of these things out there all showing a 10btc balance... and then one day 99 people "loose" their 10 coins.  (or all 100 in the case of a truly bad actor, honestly only a bad actor who is a fucking idiot would reclaim the wallet themselves.. BUT...)
And breaking the stick?  I'm guessing fetching the private key from the stick essentially resets the stick into one of 3 modes... *initialize...(waiting for files) trade... (swapping with people) expose ...(giving private key) and they keep track of that state internally..
Here's a trick, power up the CPU to a power too low for it to program it's own flash, but enough to run it's clock, then short or disconnect the wires that it uses to determine state, with some needles or scalpel.
I bet some combination of trickery could crack that nut.

I would say that the most likely deflationary spiral event would be a mistake found in the crypto, or some part of the algorithm, like if you could find a shortcut in the proof-of-work algorithm, it could undercut the value, as miners would implement the better version.  BUT difficulty would eventually adjust back up, so as long as the work isn't a 0 or something other futzing about with the system allows hacks.
I mean honestly right now 'DNS hacking' would be the best way to go, if you attack the dns providers for a pool, to point to a pool you run, ... well....
Even for the smaller pools that could easily be ~10grand in your pocket.
Obviously the DNS hacking won't make to much of a dent because, I'd assume the dns lookup is done not that often, but I could be wrong.  I was just conjecturing a possible scenario.

"Freedom of choice" ... sure, I worked at a startup where 60-80 hours weeks is a "choice".  Sitting in a 30$ wal-mart chair for 12 hours a day.   
Then there's this guy who practically lives there, totally gets off on "we're making great things" mantra. Always looks at you on the way out the door:  "Oh you're leaving early today" when it's 7pm and your back hurts from sitting in the aforementioned chair.
This dude is fairly well connected, when you hear him say that you cringe.  You realize that if he alone decides to disrepute you it may be hard to maintain work in this industry. That's just one unknown you don't want to deal with. 
After a couple months you realize you've strapped yourself to some proverbial missile that you have no parachute to get off of.  Since it's a startup they're paying you half your market value (if even!) but the bills are now slipping and you're going into debt.
"But nobody has a gun pointed at their head" - Sure you can say that, but by the time you realize you need to bail, you've missed your moment to do so. There's no financial security anymore, and while you can look for a job, you know you'll get fired if you put in less than 50hours this week, and maybe what you can do is start showing up earlier than anyone else, so it "look" like you're there longer... (which I did from time to time) You also find out that "that one guy" is totally watching internet traffic, and he asked you why you were browsing linked-in so much.  But sure, there's no "gun to your head"
"Well you obviously didn't have what it takes to work there" - I managed for a year, sleeping on conference tables from time to time during "crunches" I finally managed to leave as a straight exchange to another startup, which was a total shit show (but that's another story).   There were only 2 coders who managed to stay the long haul, the CTO even bailed to get away from the environment.
"You could have left" - Sure, and then be stuck in limbo, nobody likes working at a place for 3-6mo and then leaving.  You have to explain that to your next employer, so could have left.  And If I don't find a replacement job quickly, I could have also lost my house, my car, my storage facilities and moved back into my grandparents house, 200 miles away.   That sounds super appealing.
I think the worst of the experiences I had, was I realized how much I didn't know about what I was signing up for in the first place.  That's the worst, and that's why so many people find the relationships like this so unfair and unreasonable, when you finally get involved with them, it's like an abusive partner whom you're fiscally indebted to.  The rules are different than what you thought they were going to be, and were explained what they would be in the first place.
**You live you learn ya know?** And while my ramblings may not appeal to your sensibilities, realize that I'm only pointing out the one absurd realtionship I had with a startup.  I believe in the Heinlein quote: "There is no such thing as luck; there is only adequate or inadequate preparation to cope with a statistical universe."  And of all of the situations described above, a number of them could have been dealt with if I had prepared.  If anyone's interested, my take away from my experiences is: "Don't get started in a startup, even as an employee without having 6mo of savings"  If I had prepared that for myself there would have been no issues about "leaving if they don't provide reasonable chairs" or "leaving when the bills are slipping" or "telling that one guy to fuck off and get out of my personal business"

I believe I have ~4 coins on a hard drive somewhere, in some closet or basement or ... god knows where.
Every person who has ever speculated knows the feeling of "damn I think I'm right on this one".  in ~jul 2009 (really unsure)  I was using a cpu miner on a laptop.
I was considering buying in I was very "sure" that eventually these would be worth something.  It just made sense.  I was worried about their inevitable legal status, and possible legal battle to be able to even pull money out of them.
After voicing concerns with friends and family and people I knew to understood market's and valuations.  I determined that I wasn't interested in the risk, that it would be awesome to follow in the news.
I regret the decision, a bit - but not much so I'm not going to be a billionaire off bitcoin.  I had other assets to invest in at the time, and they have allowed me to survive in these past few years, so... no skin off my back.  In the other hand my current assets will not allow me to survive into the future.  So perhaps then I will notice my decision, and think "that would have been novel" and then forget about it.
Because in the end those who bought in, probably really didn't have "faith" or fervent belief they'd be rich from these things, hence all of the "I bought X coins in 2010 and now I'm rich stories"  They didn't see the value, or they might have cashed out in any one of the previous bubbles.

Actually to their defense the two teachers that stuck with me, were my algebra teachers, the one let me write computer programs that solved my homework for me, on my second semester (second time around) and the Algebra two teacher, my senior year let me remediate all my homework of that semester in something like 4 days, which was trivial to me.  I've always been efficient at math, just not efficient as a "homework/studying student"
My Algebra I teacher, he actually pulled me aside, and was disappointed enough in me that he was talking from desperation, he opens the grade book, and he says "0, 0, 0, 0, 0 - that was your home work for last week, and all but 1 assignment from the previous 2 weeks was not turned in, but here are your test scores, 105, 110, 95, 105, 110, etc ... you've set the curve in all but two of my tests this quarter, you obviously know this stuff, homework should be a breeze"
I could tell he honestly cared if I passed or failed his class, it really stuck with me, I did try harder in his class.  But in general I just didn't care about school.
I actually only graduated high school because of those 2 teachers, oh and a certain english teacher who would write "passing" on my report card.  he said "You're obviously an a quick learner, but a poor doer.
