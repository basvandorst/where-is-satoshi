Holy shit.


That's incredibly fascinating. I never thought about it that way, but I think you're right. I would ***love*** to see a coin that uses crowd sourced computational power to solve real world [problems]( I wonder if that's the next big thing. Seems like that could have incredible potential to accelerate scientific and technological progress, especially considering what's already possible with [machine learning]( I really hope we're moving in that direction!
Thanks for the answers!

Quite a set up! So many questions.
1. Is the oil being pumped somewhere to get rid of excess heat? If so, where?
2. Is this set up in someone's garage somewhere, or are you renting space specifically for this project? How does this setup impact the temperature of the building it's located in? Any concerns of drawing the attention of law enforcement looking for grow ops?
3. What's the wattage on this whole setup? On average, how much revenue do you expect to make from this per unit of time?
4. Is this setup always on, or do you turn it off for maintenance like cleaning the oil?
5. What made you decide to invest so heavily in bitcoin mining? Why do you expect bitcoin mining to offer a better RoI than mining other currencies, or creating/investing in some other kind of business? (Assuming you're not just a rich hobbyist)
