Hi Guys,
This is the update story on GCN (which was GCoin)
Late last year we were approached by a group from the USA. They have purchased the rights to the GCoin name, logo and all website URL’s.
We are now GCN only. We have no idea who the company is.
We now have enough funding to keep GCN developing for a very long time.
The new main website is 
We also have just launched  We reckon it’s the easiest and fastest file transfer system out there. No email address needed. No Links. Just the file and a password that you make up. It works on iPhones, Android phones, laptops, notebooks and computers. Type gfile.us into Safari or Chrome etc. It’s a free service. Maximum file size is 5GB. You get GCN 10,000 free when you download your file. There are some charges for additional services. For example if you want to store files etc for more than a week.
Most of the original GCN 31.5 billion to be distributed through the games from 2014 is gone. There is GCN 3 billion left. We will provide the free GCN for 
Our GCar android app for car sharing is complete and working.We haven’t launched it yet as we’ve been distracted with the GCN change and  We intend to launch it soon and integrate GCN at a later date.
World of Electronics sales are going well too. You can spend your GCN there to buy electronics. They will ship worldwide so spend spend spend.
Other than that it’s business as usual.
All the best Greg
