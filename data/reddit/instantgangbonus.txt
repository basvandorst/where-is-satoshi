Facebook COULD stay king forever, if they accepted much lower company earnings (only little above operating costs). Certainly Mark Zuckerberg and stakeholders won't do so, therefore sooner or later Facebook is going to be disrupted by a company/ an organisation which pays back the users in return for their valuable time and content.

Get in, my friend!! A hack of an exchange is the MOST BEAUTIFUL gift for anyone who wants to get in, since that is no Bitcoin-inherent problem, just a problem of the exchange and its poor trusty users. Furthermore: We have a BEEAUUUTIFUL ROCK SOLID LONG TERM SUPPORT line at 450 USD and right now we are at 550 USD, and now tell me: Is 550 soooo much above 450 so that you can't justify to get in now?? Of course not!! That's almost exactly the same price when we compare with our potential investment target, which is somewhere between 5000 and 50000 (or whatever). 550 or 450 just makes no difference for that! SO GET IN!

You said:
"You'll notice that the changes made are actually much, much, much larger than a single line of code being changed, because there are other aspects of the code that will break if you don't make changes to accommodate for the new limit."

Central part of the arcticle: Quote by Andreas:
"They [Coinbase] have a fully KYC/AML-ed customer on one end of their connection, but if they receive a payment that’s going to that customer over the Lightning Network, they have no idea whether that customer’s the final destination… If they receive one coming in from that customer, they have no idea if that customer’s the origin… Which means their KYC just fell apart – completely fell apart."

- Fork of the blockchain: Hodlers get coins on both chains
- Fork of the code base: Hodlers don't get coins on the new chain
Result: Forking of the blockchain is seen more like an attack to get market share from an existing coin, while forking of the code base more aims at new fiat money.

Ethereum combines a "blockchain safety layer" with a programmable "smart contract layer", all together in one product. As other smart guys have pointed out years ago: It MIGHT TURN OUT that it's smart to SEPARATE those 2 layers! While the Ethereum approach of course is convenient.

This is the PERFECT solution. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:52:33
Easy one: If one layer ("one module") fails, then the other layer (other module) is unaffected.
You find this concept all over in the engineering world. Example: Car brake system with ABS. ABS is built as a second layer. If ABS fails, your brake system gives a fuck. You're brakes will still work.
Please note also: I didn't say that separating the layers in the crypto world IS smart, I said that smart guys have pointed out that it MIGHT TURN OUT to be smart. Nobody knows for sure right now. Disclaimer: I actually think it IS smart. The real honey badger is not Bitcoin itself, but several blockchains existing parallely, each blockchain highly specialized, and all blockchains connected with each other over independent layer-2s. THAT'S the real honey badger nobody can bring down.

The big question right now is how the Lightning Network will actually play out. There's a POSSIBILITY that the majority of users will connect to one of maybe a handful "mega hubs". It's not hard to imagine that being one of several "mega hubs" offers tremendous potential to make $$$, not only with transaction fees (very low but very many), but also with other ways of monetization if users of your channel visit your webpage regularly.
Again: It's just a POSSIBILITY that some mega hubs will evolve. (I think it will. I hope it won't. At least not too much.)

- Countries are in competition with each other. If you ban it in YOUR country, YOUR country will lose against those countries who didn't ban.
- Governmants technically CAN'T really ban it. They can make it a pain in the ass to use, yes. Just think of peer-to-peer filesharing. Is that still a thing today or was the government able to ban it?
- Regulation is not that bad at ALL! It would be so nice to have trustworthy exchanges which are regulated by governments, and it would be nice if some of them obvious altcoin scammers would be in jail (like Onecoin)


- Renewables are growing with SUCH a pace, that this is a non-issue.
- The energy that is consumed by POS is far less than the energy consumed by all the banking industry right now (which we are aiming to replace)
- POW will be replaced more and more by POS over time
- Even if POW consumes a lot of energy: What is wrong with that? Is sound money not worth say 5% of the world's energy?

1) I feel your pain
2) I just checked transaction fees: They have come down from over 800 sat/byte to about 80 sat/byte AND FALLING. You have paid 50 sat/byte in your transaction.

@_date: 2017-12-31 14:27:33
Also Trezor + Ledger. Their recommendations are like:
- High: 900 sat/byte
- Medium: 850 sat/byte
- Low: 810 sat/byte
while you could go with custom 200 sat/byte and get confirmed easily within 1 hour or say.
 
{[(But take care: If you choose "custom fee" on your Ledger nano s, fees for Segwit transactions are calculated wrong! (Example: You set it to 200, but the actual fee is only 130.) Ledger, come on...)]}
Edit: Put the last part in {[( )]} because it seems that I am wrong. There is sat/byte AND sat/WU now.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:47:42
Yes, it's segwit (just edited). So, you're saying then it's not ledgers fault? Shouldn't they cover both cases? I mean you know how bad it can be to have your money stuck for 2 weeks because of underpaying fees.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:31:25
What REALLY would SOLVE the problem in its core:
- An open and complex algorithm, which calculates fees way better than it is done right now by wallets. That algorithm gets as input the blockchain and all mempool states of the past, and it delivers as output a set of numbers like: "99% likelihood of execution within 10 minutes: 300 sat/byte. 90% likelihood of execution within 1 hour: 150 sat/byte" and so on.
- Replace-by-fee integrated in all wallets and services. With that, you can go lower with your fees, and in the worst case, you can pay more later. (Instead of your money being stuck for 2 weeks whatsoever)

Super dangerous, indeed!

Ah, I see. Sorry, I didn't even think of that anybody could doubt that bitcoin.de is ultra reputable. Problem is just: Where are you from? You need a German bank account (Fidor-Bank) if you want the best bitcoin.de experience. Your Fidor fiat bank account and your bitcoin.de coin account can be connected. Then you get the real experience! Smash the sell button and 5 seconds later you've got a new e-mail from Fidor saying: "Ding ding ding! You just received money!" - and the money already IS on your Fidor bank account in that moment. (By the way: Fidor is of course 100,000000% safe, since it's a regular bank, which has a normal BaFin-License and whatever German government requires.)

TumbleBit. It allows you to mix your Bitcoins like you can do today with a Bitcoin mixer website, but with TumbleBit you won't have to trust that website nor anybody else. It's a serious project which shouldn't take long to be deployed, since they seem to have finished research already. TumbleBit was mentioned many times by Andreas Antonopoulos and others in a positive way. More info: 
Edit: Actually it's way more than just a Bitcoin mixer, it's a 2nd-layer payment hub that provides privacy and fungibilty for Bitcoin.

- There's going to be a huge ICO.
- There's going to be Blockstream hardware wallets which connect to the satellites. (Maybe even an open protocol allowing ANY hardware wallet to connect to the satellites.)
- It's going to be made in a way where you don't have to trust Blockstream. (That's because Blockstream isn't dumb and they know it wouldn't work out if they tried to position themselves as the new FED.)
- However, Blockstream would certainly take some small transaction fee like 0,1 %. I'm more than fine with that, if I it enables private/fungible/anonymous transactions over the space lightning network.

I SWEAR TO YOU I am not trying to mislead! You have given NO arguments! Saying something is the "key component" is no argument for it being good! Saying "It's not Bitcoin if it doesn't use PoW" is wrong and actually misleading! If 90% of the economic majority choose to go with PoS, you'll be surprised what fork will be called Bitcoin!
It's sad because I am not trying to argue but you guys give me a hard time and you are the guys who are actually not discussing and just trying to discredit me. I really think you are wrong, or maybe paid by miners. I am just a regular Bitcoin holder who has interest in the long term value of Bitcoin.

So your point is "PoS is bad, because the rich get richer"? That's not correct. Correct is: With PoS EVERYBODY who chooses to stake gets richer. (Same percentage-gain for everybody.)

Valid points. TL;DR: Open source software for hardware wallets is nice but still somehow pointless, unless you also check 100% of the hardware (which most people obviously can't).

Thanks for your work! This is what I was wondering all the time but nobody here DISCUSSES it at all. Everybody just always says: "Miners have an incentive of a high Bitcoin price because blah blah blah" but that's actually not the case, as you pointed out! I stay invested in Bitcoin, but I'm looking for a switch to POS, which I'm going to support with all my BTC. Sure, miner troll armies will fight this hard and downvote comments like mine. But the beautiful thing is: When hardforking to POS mining hash rate is useless :)

Sorry, didn't want to make any statement on Ledger being any better than Trezor! I just happened to own a Ledger, not a Trezor, that's why I mentioned Ledger. But wait, what did you just say? Trezor is 100% open source? Then I'm going to order a Trezor immediately! Edit: Ok that was a little bit too fast by me. Open source software for a hardware wallet is only then an advantage if you also check the hardware 100% (which I can't).
@_date: 2017-04-22 11:25:45
Well, at least you don't need to have miners to agree when hardforking to PoS :))) That's the fun part. Sure, you're right, we're going to have to wait years for it. (More research and field-testing have to be done with PoS first.)

"Secondly, there was a ton of support for that statement considering that there were disclaimers EVERYWHERE that it is experimental software and funds could potentially be lost."
Correct. I didn't doubt that. My point was that Elisabeth PRETENDED "she was worried about that", while in reality she was worried about herself. 
And considering your request to name sources: Come on. Though it would be great, yes, I really don't feel like I have to provide sources for my statements. You could almost every post auto-answer with "Source? No? Then shut up."

"Respect". Let's see what the Poloniex Chief Experience Officer answered in the Reddit thread "Do we know who runs poloniex?" (with comments added by me):
- Quote: "I'm sorry there is so little information on us." --&gt; So, you're sorry? Then we can expect you to give out more information on you now?
- Quote: "Truth is, we grew so quickly in 2016 that we had to focus all of our efforts on growth and compliance and haven't had any bandwidth to update the marketing/informational side of our website." --&gt; So, let me get this straight: The number 1 crypto exchange always WANTED to give out more information about themselves but simply had NO TIME for that?!? This is a joke at best. (Actually it's just fooling the customers.)
- Quote: "It's something we're actively working on and it should be published in the coming months." --&gt; Guess what: One year has passed, and nothing has happened. Some knew it all the time, that you're not going to give out any information about you, but of course we had to give you the benefit of doubt.
- Quote: "Poloniex is not a one man shop that is poised to take a runner - we're 30+ people and growing rapidly." --&gt; So, 30+ people? Employed by which company exactly and located where exactly? Or are we talking about upgraded troll box moderators who are barely known, working from home, nobody knows where in the world they are located, but maybe they even have access to private customer data?
- Quote: "As people have mentioned in this thread, Tristan is the founder and CEO and he does have a music background." --&gt; So, you're giving us a first name, and expect us to know that guy from the first name? I googled over 1 hour - you will NOT find out who is "Tristan". And why are you telling us about his "music background", how is that even relevant? It is not. You were just trying to fool your customers. Remember: 1 Minute ago he stated he was "sorry that there is so little information on us", and now he is trying to fix that by giving us a useless first name and the 'valuable' music background information?! A joke, at best.
- Quote: "I'm the CXO (Chief Experience Officer) and have been with Poloniex since early 2014, you can find me here on Reddit or on Twitter as  --&gt; Exactly, on Reddit and Twitter, hidden behind nicknames. No information, which would be of any value for authorities to find you, if the number of users reporting "Poloniex is withholding my funds from me" would increase further.

Draghi: "However, recent developments, such as the listing of Bitcoin futures contracts by US exchanges, could lead European banks too to hold positions in Bitcoin." That's going to happen with 100% certainty because European banks are going to make crypto futures, too, but it doesn't mean moon.

Elizabeth is weak and she knows it. However, some fanboys don't care, they just see a good looking woman talking about the most important Bitcoin topic right now, which must be good.

You want facts? There u go:
When other Lightning Teams released software, she said she thinks "it's totally irresponsible to release software at this point in time" because she "was so afraid that losers could lose money." I said: She's lying, she is just afraid that her Lightning team might be late, and therefore lose influence/ fame/ money/ whatsoever. Some weeks later she comes up with: "Guess what, we've worked night and day, and now we release our software!" - yeah well. She's a little liar. Pretending to care about users losing money, but actually only cared about losing influence/ fame/ money/ whatsoever (as said before). But sure, you can fall for her, blind fanboys.

Problem with that is: You admit that your BTC stash is significant. People are asking because they (wrongly) assume your BTC stash isn't significant. Like asking someone: "How many McDonald's coupons do you own?"Answering that with "How much do you have saved in your bank account?" is strange.

- Crypto currencies like Bitcoin have a great future because in some aspects they are superior to our paper money
- It's a real monetary revolution. One has to know, right now national states are preventing currency competition by giving their central banks monopolies.
- Once Bitcoin has become a normal part of investment portfolios, price volatility will come down. 
- A crypto currency may go down to zero, however, there's also the chance that a crypto currency will replace fiat sooner or later.

Can confirm. Fidor in Germany: Super fast with Kraken and of course they have SEPA and IBAN.

Sure! The blockchain is a huuuuge list (think of it as an excel file) containing information who owns how many bitcoins. Since the bitcoin ownership changes constantly, and since the blockchain isn't stored in one central place but instead on thousand computers all over the world which all have one copy of the blockchain, these computers must synchronize the blockchain constantly. Obviously, it is much better for everybody if this synchronization works fast and smoothly. Or in other words: When new information is added to the blockchain it is better for everybody if this information reaches everybody else quickly. The here discussed FIBRE software ultimately does nothing else than helping to archive a higher speed of this synchronization process. Contrary to existing solutions, the FIBRE software does this in a decentralized way, which is always good (in our opinion). However, there is a well-known physical limit for how fast information can be transmitted from A to B: with the speed of light. Faster is not possible. It turns out, that we are actually getting close to that limit, which is an incredible thing! My guess is: Ultimately, in the future at some point, we definitely won't have to wait 10 minutes like today until a transaction is verified. Give it time. I don't know if it will be 5 seconds or 0.5 seconds, but it definitely won't be 10 minutes. (The theoretical limit is 0.07 seconds. That would be the speed of light.)

The key part is at 2:00 - 2:15

Maybe some surprise Anschluss joke? (Don't get it myself, though.)
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:06:40
it doesn't, since in Germany it's woooow, too
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:31:40
Yes there is
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:41:04
And why didn't you sell mid 2016?
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:57:22
Will those be compatible amongst each other?
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:57:25
Then you're gains are really legit. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:19:09
there u go: 
(you just have to wait until price is actually moving sideways)

Just to make it clear: With "super fast" I mean that it takes approximately 10 minutes to withdraw EUR from Kraken to your Fidor account.

Source, redditor for 1 week?
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:34:42
That was not what OP wanted to know i guess. Let me try:
Wikipedia: "Halva is a sweet confection served across the Middle East, South Asia, Central Asia, West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Balkans, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Malta and the Jewish diaspora."
Now clear? It's just a pun.
Note: This post should not be interpreted as statement from me that I'm from the Middle East, South Asia, Central Asia, West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Malta or the Jewish diaspora.

Source, please?

Tl;dr: Crypto is here to stay. BTC and ETH? Not 100% sure.

You could see it like that, however I'd prefer to not have to pay for other customers who use ATMs on a regular basis. (While I go cashless)
