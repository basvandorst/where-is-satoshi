You should contact my bank who ate the loss when my wallet(debit card) was stolen.

If they can't figure out how to not associate with an obvious Ponzi scheme then they are incompetent.

You could start by visiting their website.  I know that is too much to ask.  
Embarrassing.

CEO of a Bitcoin business doesn't understand how the law works.  Shocking.

This thread is one giant fallacy.

Such a stable price.  Who wouldn't want operate their business around bitcoins!

Which is a completely valid response to someone who claims that bitcoin will be as successful as the internet because of some irrelevant quote about the internet. This subreddit is full of true believers who believe with every fiber or their being that the price of bitcoin will always go up and is the future of currencies.  They then downvote anyone who disagrees. 


Are you kidding me?  They are new and unique.  No one has any basis to make any long term predictions about bitcoin because there is nothing to compare it to.

What do you think happens to the money if the bank fails?  Also anyone who "believes" in an economic theory is silly.

When did I even come close to saying you were a socialist? I made the point that the income tax had wide support including many socialist organizations.  It wasn't some evil plot cooked up by bankers and forced on the country.  It was a popular reform.  Not everything is a conspiracy.  That is your little box.  Read a book or two.

That isn't why the internet took off.  It is also rather debatable how much freedom having ones money in bitcoin provides.  It is just another investment and the risks are completely unknown.  Yet if you were listen to this subreddit bitcoins are a sure thing as if they have all the answers and can see the future.

Why would any serious big time business want to accept bitcoins?  The price is so volatile that it makes little sense to assume such risk without any real benefit.

Why wouldn't I just use steam?

The Chinese government is a massive bureaucracy and the people making programming decisions are likely not the ones making financial regulations.

Did you even look at the chart?  So delusional.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:41:29
Because clearly whether or not bitcoin will be a good investment is the same thing as asking if a starving animal will eat food.
You are the exact type of zealot I am talking about.

Most likely, yes.

The income tax had quite a bit of support, including many socialist organizations, who are well known for their allegiance to bankers. It must be nice to be able to fit every single thing into the tiny box that is your world view, ignoring anything that doesn't confirm your beliefs.

People laughed at the Segway too.  Not everything is the internet.

I am going to put my life savings in a currency that is propped up by people buying drugs on the internet.  There is zero chance that party will ever be broken up by the feds.  Nope. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:04:53
Is it really hard for you to understand why people would not want to invest their money in bitcoins?
