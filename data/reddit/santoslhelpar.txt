Your shit post makes the sub look like a grocery ad.

Came here to post the truth, I see you have already done that. Good post, the axe is coming, my prediction: right before or right after Christmas, when everyone has already bought gifts based on the wealth effect. Peace.

We don't.  CNBC is not a trusted source, so dont expect them to be.

I got 25$ in coinbase from the referrals, too bad it's worthless once I try to withdraw it, (about 22$ in fees)

If they didn't care why set up securities? I never said they will destroy fiat. And I do believe governments like control.

Somebody gets it, its been a long time coming!

Agreed, the dip will come like an axe, we will see 50% drop, then we will gain momentum when we trim the fat.

Wall Street in general, they don't like Bitcoin, why would they set up securities if they don't like Bitcoin?

Going to do this now, those BTC invite rewards had become worthless when you would send them to a wallet.

It's Coinbase, you have your answer.

I hold both, I hate these posts.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:40:23
Thank you for having a brain.

Always happens, however with good practice, it will only happen once. (HODL)

You could have made the same joke with much less exposure, just knowing you have one Bitcoin will have you become a target. I would delete this post if I were you.

Thought I'd let you know, I'm Bullish on Bitcoin now, I bet we will see it gain that market cap back as the spring goes on.  
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:40:31
Bitcoin down, so Bitcoin bad?

Canadian here, I give 0 fucks about the american dollar. Maple syrup is my standard for commerce.

No we dont

Still holding?

Yup, I'm banned.

Because they can't.  Think of what they would have to do in order to stop it, and it will be obvious they cannot.  (Cut off one head, and two will grow.)
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:20:16
And also, they are likely invested in it themselves.

Old people love banks, but they are old.  Children use Bitcoin, and they are the future.  Complex systems?  Get real, it's very simple to deal with crypto, even Dimon's daughter uses it.

'Good times' more like it.
