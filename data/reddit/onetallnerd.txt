Download  on your phone and hook up your debit card or bank and change the currency to bitcoin and buy. :-)
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:37:15
Or it could be incoming bitcoin that were being deposited that were hacked. That wouldn't be affected by the limit.

Coinbase is nice. I like their exchange, but I buy all my bitcoin from circle now with my debit card. Always instant and fast not to mention cheaper.
@_date: 2016-04-18 04:46:55
It's necessary by law for AML laws or companies going the extra mile to verify you are who you say you are. That said I have not used cex.io. Try a bigger/licensed more trusted brokerage like coinbase or circle? Those require some ID verification, but those are safe and I can vouch for them.
@_date: 2016-08-13 01:58:23
He's an idiot. Don't let him get to you Jerry.
@_date: 2016-04-10 15:30:41
I don't see anything wrong with that. You shouldn't keep your Bitcoin on an online wallet anyway ;)

Check out my one listing. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 23:30:45
I do check lol. Circle is always cheaper with a debit card when compared to buying the same bitcoin I would on coinbase through a bank account. It doesn't make sense!
@_date: 2016-04-07 03:52:33


You mean your own compatible bitcoin core fork. lol
@_date: 2016-04-25 22:59:43

Yeah, red flags should immediately be going up if a zip file is sent or them telling you to install anything.
@_date: 2016-04-25 22:23:19
I know about greenaddress, but that implies multsig, but guess that's not needed as coinbase has full control of funds.
@_date: 2016-04-21 05:22:37
Yes, the title is misleading. Yes, they were on LBC, but they were also selling DRUGS. Why that isn't in the title of this post is beyond me.
@_date: 2016-04-25 21:12:00
Can confirm. It shows up for me too.
@_date: 2016-04-29 01:16:59
Higher buy price but it's still cheaper than (Coinbase with a lower price + fees). Most of the time. You'd think Coinbase would be cheaper as they run an actual exchange.
@_date: 2016-04-23 01:24:22
Gil seems to get it. The difference between permission and decentralized blockchains was the best part.
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:02:10
Circle says I was charged 44.44 dollars, and it says the same when I check the charge online on my bank.
@_date: 2016-04-27 22:43:31
You can do either of them. Pay at checkout, or load up the wallet with steam credit.
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:53:07
Yes, I bought some yesterday on circle and it already hit my bank account.
@_date: 2016-04-06 21:30:57
Sure, but any block forward will use the simplified code to validate it after a HF. You could say the same about other transaction types. I don't think it's much of an issue. Just legacy code documented and only used for that period of time in use. Unless of course anyone actually thinks it isn't beneficial to have segwit at all? I don't think anyone is saying that. You'd have the same problem having to have the old rules via a HF or SF for older blocks.
@_date: 2016-04-06 21:31:36
I'd think it'd piggy back off another HF instead of it being on it's own to be honest.
@_date: 2016-04-28 05:19:47
Is Steam usually this quite? I don't see a blog post about it. Nothing. Zip.
@_date: 2016-04-28 23:28:25

One of the great things about this is that it's worldwide. Any place it "doesn't" work? Other than the obvious?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:49:17
People lose confidence in exchanges, means less money going onto exchanges and buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:23:56
It would probably be simpler to just be paid for not blocking ads.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:46:51
I don't quite understand this.. How did Bitgo still sign after the limits were breached? That can't be on your end.
@_date: 2016-04-25 23:27:02
It seems as if they pulled it for everyone temporarily. It disappeared from the list of options for me.
@_date: 2016-04-06 16:40:18
Yes, I know you weren't shilling. I was asking a question. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 22:34:28
Signup for circle.com, attach debit card, there may be some id verification for fraud purposes, change denomination to bitcoin, then deposit 7 bucks. :-) That or use coinbase.com, they both have mobile apps if you prefer doing it there.
@_date: 2016-04-17 18:41:30
I heard a notification pop, saw the payment come in. I completed the order and entered the steam key, he left a 5 star review. I had moderation set up in case he had a dispute, but it didn't' need to go to that so the funds were released right when he confirmed to the address I set. I was surprised how smooth it went!
@_date: 2016-04-26 17:44:16
Is Bitpay or Steam making an announcement??
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:57:05
Yes, I'm wondering why coinbase charges for debit when circle doesn't?
@_date: 2016-04-06 21:08:38
SegWit in itself is not that complex. The soft-fork implementation is. I'm willing to have it be a bit more complex and have it quicker and in the long run have a Hard fork clean up the implementation. There will have to be a hard fork eventually. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:00:33
You should change your store name to something more professional so people take you seriously.
@_date: 2016-04-25 21:14:32
Yes. I'm here in the U.S., and it shows up as on option with bitpay.
@_date: 2016-04-07 03:13:54
Because realistically why would full nodes or everyone in running bitcoin in the world continue to store a transaction with a fee of less than a cent especially once billions of people or machines start making bitcoin transactions. That just won't work. I can imagine the bloat and size of the chain. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:55:14
Difference here is that a HF in the future would clean up tricks like SW to not repurpose other data fields as well as clean it up code wise.
@_date: 2016-04-17 18:14:35
Works fine for me, I even sold a steam key I had laying around, pretty cool!
@_date: 2016-04-23 02:30:40

Doesn't circle charge less for debit?
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:59:05
I use debit on circle. (Bank of America) For .1 btc I was charged 44.44 even cheaper by a few cents than what I would have been charged if I used coinbase with a bank?
@_date: 2016-04-06 16:16:34
You trust uphold to last?
@_date: 2016-04-06 21:18:33
Yes. I see what he's saying about complexity and I was irked about it at first, but if it's only a temporary thing with the promise/intention that it will be cleaned up in a future hard fork I see no problem with it. You can even have the fork in the code ready to activate in say two years so by the time that time arrives, almost everyone will have a client that has it implemented that way without the hurry of having to have everyone to upgrade in a few weeks unlike the softfork. I think the positives and enhancements segwit brings like fixing tx malleability among other things outweigh the negatives of it being implemented as a softfork. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 22:30:36
coinbase wallet or regular wallet?

Is there a way with bip70 or something similar to have a qr code in which the merchant scans the customers phone and a prompt is displayed on the users phone that x Merchant is charging x amount to their gift card or whatever and then the user is given the choice to push that transaction? In my experience you do not want the customer to do the scanning. NFC fixes that, but not everyone has that yet, and iOS devices haven’t opened that up to third parties yet. ;)

Yes, they seemed to hype it too much and give all these advantages over bitcoin when half of them wouldn't even be ready for more than 1.5 years with funding dwindling. I wish they were more transparent in funding and in the decisions they're making. Overall I can't say I'm entirely against ethereum and actually want it to succeed or at the very least create more tech that can later be implemented into bitcoin or complement it. Augur is interesting, though! I don't regret buying, just disappointed in they way they're handling it.

Ask your parents to make an account and send the bitcoin to a local wallet like breadwallet or mycelium that you control with the backup phrases written down. Most exchanges will not let you buy bitcoin as you are not over 18. It sucks, but unless you have a bitcoin ATM around you, you're not going to be able to do it easily. Not sure if  let's you do it.

@_date: 2015-06-26 21:10:21
No, just no. He did not mean that. "What happens when 1B people have bitcoin?" The price shoots up because of the 21M limit. Having an easy way to buy bitcoin is essential for it to get into the hands of 1B people. That's what coinbase is, even if it's centralized. In no way did he say 21M was not enough.

Node-reliant? Of course they are, without them there is no bitcoin network either. GreenAddress is neat, but when you have a superior and more decentralized solution that uses the bitcoin network itself with zero down time why not use it? It was never claimed that GreenAddress was a hosted wallet. For most users having any downtime will off put them and drive them away from bitcoin.

Depends where you live? You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin. If you do happen to live in the U.S. You can buy on coinbase using your bank account. There is a limit on how much you can buy and a delay on when you get your coins for new and unverified users. I recommend reading up more on what you are getting into before you buy. 
Play with small amounts first with what people have tipped you and buy what you can afford to lose when you are comfortable with it. 500 bits 1 million bits = 1 bitcoin. :)

@_date: 2014-11-27 05:43:59
hmm. Well I'm fully verified on coinbase and can instant buy up to a thousand dollars a week. That's plenty for me. Circle is up to $500. So 1.5k a week instant. It took months for me to get verified on coinbase to get to that though. They had issues for a while, but I finally got through with their verification questions. Circle pretty much verified me instantly with the minimum information needed except when I linked the bank for the first time for verification which took a few days for the deposit check thing. (they're also having growing pains with new users)
As for confirmations, they're not necessary for small payments in person, but if you're buying or selling they are which is an issue. There are workarounds for those, like instant confirmations for those type of purchases/buys. (
As for anonymity, I haven't been asked by circle or coinbase for a picture ID. Try watermarking the scan of your picture id for the site you're sending it to. And if you also mean anonymity in the coins you hold you could tumble them after you buy them.

Right now it's still VISA or Mastercard for the average consumer. You might save 2-4%, but have bitcoin's value itself go down 10%. Hopefully once the volatility decreases bitcoin will be the better choice, but right now it isn't, even though it is for the merchant that immediately converts it. But in no way is bitcoin a ponzi. :P

Sure we don't need them, but realistically in our current society this won't fly with the regulators. -xyz is not literally saying we -need- it to convert to fiat, but in order for it to realistically be implemented by our current society we have very little choice here in the U.S. Ideally I'm waiting for the day we won't even need to exchange to or from fiat.
@_date: 2014-10-28 04:06:40

Yes, otherwise you'd have to wait for the transaction to confirm every time you traded which wouldn't be ideal. It would also bloat up the blockchain so it makes sense to have trades like that off chain. Although leaving your btc on the exchange to trade also presents security risks as current exchanges are centralized making them a huge target for hacks like Mt.Gox.

That's how it works? If BTC-e doesn't become more transparent or prove it's trustworthy to a user then that user should leave.

Do you have any ideas on how to improve the system?

I bought a shirt around a week ago in bitcoin. It was quick and painless. Although, there really should be a bitcoin accepted logo next to the other payment options. No one visiting the site would know they accept bitcoin. Also, I heard about the free hat, but it doesn't show anywhere on the invoice that I'm getting one? Do they just add it in apart from it. (I haven't received the shirt yet)
@_date: 2014-12-28 07:02:09
You can, try circle.com
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:52:27
Only thing I'll give Circle now is lower fees and in my case faster verification.
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:02:33
Nice username :P Here is 600 bits :)
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:10:52
Sad no one gives you any?
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:43:33
I still can't get verified. Been trying for months. :(
@_date: 2014-12-16 05:55:14
Let us implement it ourselves the . Why include a flag set as default that you use for everyone else?
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:47:54
I'm here in the U.S., mine does too, no BTC ATM though :(
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:26:05
I feel your pain. I'm a full time college student working part time putting a bit of my money in bitcoin every week.
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:28:30
For digital items sure, but buying something physical or through another online store? That's different.
@_date: 2014-02-03 08:03:08
“We are basing Coincove in local marketplaces, and using them as entry and exit nodes.” So more alike to localbitcoins?

I'd rather it not fluctuate so much even with news. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:48:41
I emailed my local NPR station to consider accepting it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:36:54
If you live in the U.S. buy through coinbase. Make an email just for it to not get hacked. Use 2FA on coinbase. If you don't understand something well be happy to answer any specific questions you may have.
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:50:07
Bitstamp isn't a wallet. It keeps most of its funds offline as to lessen losses if they kept it all on an online wallet. The bad thing about this being that withdraws will take longer if their hot wallet is depleted. You should keep transfer your bitcoin to a local wallet for spending. (even coinbase an online wallet had issues sometimes sending out payments because of this before, although lately I haven't had any issues or delays with them)
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:43:20
Better than blockchain? How does it handle private keys? Is it trustworthy? I live in the U.S. and I downloaded it when it was still out but never used it.
@_date: 2014-02-19 09:03:38
If you're into computer games. 
Is out with it's 11th Humble Indie Bundle. You can pay however much bitcoin you want and decide what portion of it you want to send to charity or developers while getting a set of cool games.

@_date: 2014-11-25 01:54:42
I was a bit surprised to be honest haha. Is this @_date: 2014-06-03 23:20:57
The people complaining are the ones assuming your friend cares about keeping his purchase of bitcoins anonymous. For that amount I would recommend buying though  or coinbase if he or she  doesn't mind spreading out his purchases as there are daily limits. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 07:54:18
Classic bitcoin. It has been like this all year.

Litecoin on Mt.Gox coming soon. Any day now.
@_date: 2014-08-23 05:06:18
Buying it is still too cumbersome and takes way too long. Maybe once Circle comes out and people can buy some right away without waiting 5 days.
@_date: 2014-12-07 03:04:25
Two months is new?
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:22:19
CVS? I think you're looking at this the wrong way. It's good for companies to accept bitcoin even when they immediately convert. Suppliers would never accept it when it's this volatile, but how can Bitcoin become stable without adoption? These are temporary workarounds to spread adoption, at least until it's stable enough to hold. Chicken and the egg problem.
@_date: 2014-07-31 18:52:47
Thanks man! I'll pass it on. :)
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:44:34
At this point I don't even think Amazon accepting bitcoin would drive up the price all that much.

Not yet, cash is still king in most of those.It's unavoidable if bitcoin actually does explode in use.

It is related. Now payment processors like coinbase or Bitpay can work with these dispensaries without fearing the banks will stop doing business with them.

There is no Windows 9. Old programs checked version numbers of Windows that started with a 9, so they had to skip over to 10 to avoid problems I guess.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:06:06
Try also setting up with bitpay. No hurry as you haven't had anyone come in, but it's always nice to have a backup if coinbase is down. What's your store?
@_date: 2014-12-07 23:38:37
We should all start a meetup again. (There was one that used to happen in the La Habra area) I believe Mixedtees open a location that allows you to pay with Bitcoin in OC. There's also a market in Fullerton that accepts it and has the btc sticker.
@_date: 2014-12-23 09:19:25
Both, online and in person. I ordered it online and picked it up instead of shipping it.

Any bitcoin chatter you hear with other employees?
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:24:05
One in Brea too. I also believe Mission Market is also opening a location here that will accept bitcoin. (ATM is actually in the market, pretty cool)
@_date: 2014-03-18 06:58:43
I'm seeing it on my end here too.
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:08:37

Out of bits for now. The price drop really hurts.. Hope to tip more when it's back up a bit.

Keep a backup in case they lose it. I'm sure you already do, though.

@_date: 2014-04-11 06:26:52
Basically the same as banning bitcoin.. Not that they could actually enforce a complete ban on it.
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:53:19
Cool! Welcome aboard. Make sure you have 2 factor authentication enabled with coinbase and the email you use with it. Having your coins stolen would suck.

You live in the U.S. or in another country where the currency isn't as volatile? You'd think differently if you were in countries like Argentina.

@_date: 2014-09-14 01:11:57
I remember that too. I should just compile it again to remove the jailbreak warning. I don't install many tweaks anyway and wouldn't keep much money on the wallet that I wouldn't mind losing.
@_date: 2014-10-31 03:11:21
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:26:25
Well, it's useful like this. Say I have a friend that only has an iPhone and he/she wants to receive bitcoin now.. I can download this app generate an address and send him/her bitcoin? They can later export the key into another service.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:48:27
Same. I stopped listening to anything he said after he started promoting maxcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:42:22
It really should be default not opt in. Is it nowadays?
@_date: 2014-11-28 22:03:49
Same! I bought it for my dad and total ending up being $337.24 due to taxes.. :)
@_date: 2014-09-14 06:33:51
Last time I compiled the source I had to run a Mac OS on a VM, it was so and painful. If used the wallet more in person I'd do it right now.
@_date: 2014-12-08 05:28:13
So many things wrong with this post. Yes it may be faster by a few seconds but not minutes, just have your wallet already open. Bitpay is free for merchants, no fee? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:53:52
When you receive the tip it's in the changetip wallet. If you make a coinbase account you can send the tip to your coinbase wallet if you want. :)

Bitwallet for now is the best and most polished wallet I've used at the moment on iOS. I wouldn't put more than I keep in my regular wallet there. I'm considering switching to greenaddress when they've ironed out all the bugs on their app, though.
@_date: 2014-06-27 03:29:18
Ah! I get it. I got very lucky, while not so for you at all!

I don't even 
@_date: 2014-07-20 02:02:28
Yea. I signed up for circle. Hopefully I get in soon. The $100 limit on instant buy is annoying on coinbase since I can't get verified. :( I'd use trucoin, but I'd rather avoid the credit card fees.
@_date: 2014-10-23 00:43:59
I didn't need to do any of those?
@_date: 2014-09-18 05:36:58
Isn't that closed source? or parts of it?

Wtf someone explain?'!!!
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:59:39
Dang. I just told my Berkeley friends and they got nothing. How embarrassing. :( (they were all bitcoin virgins) Sucks to think the people that actually got it today were probably people that already had coinbase accounts with another email and not new users.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:31:22
What wallets do you use? Specifically on your mobile device.
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:05:30
Mycelium does have NFC support. I've used it on my brother's android phone. Not sure of multsig support. As for protecting your private keys. They're stored locally on the phone and not by mycelium. I believe you can compile it yourself and see the code changes so you know they won't go rogue and add in malware to steal your coins. (I doubt they would, but it's always best to be safe)
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:10:11

@_date: 2014-08-25 19:25:13

How much is the pay at circle? I still don't understand how they invite people new to bitcoin. How would they know?
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:31:31
What kind of deal? With who, for what?
@_date: 2014-11-15 07:34:48
Times like this I wish identities were more commonly used like onename.. Putting in a moniker instead of having to copy an address from a mobile device to a pc or even on the same device is such a pain.

Aren't the processing fees high if you use your debit/credit card? I held off trying it out with my credit card and am waiting for the three day wait on bank verification. I do agree that it is straightforward and beautiful. Did I say fast? It's really fast.

Try bitpay. 0% processing fees!  Don't delete the coinbase app, have that as a backup. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 23:58:15
Breadwallet does it. I recommend it.

No surprise there.
@_date: 2014-06-14 06:52:17
Does anyone know if there is a tweak that spoofs the appstore to think we are on 7.1?
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:29:02
Good call. I used to keep most of my money on coinbase up until a few months ago. I opted for BIP38 password-encrypted paper wallets after I felt like I was ready to trust myself with it. I love coinbase's vault. I really want to come back, but the higher fees and not being able to get level 2 verified really killed it for me. :/ edit(c/p): I'm in heaven. Just tried to get verified and actually got questions. Amazing. Finally after months of trying I'm level 2 verified. Instant limit at 1k makes me happy.
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:08:09
I have no problem buying, but for the life of me I can't get verified. It doesn't provide questions... O.o

Depends where you live? It's completely legal in the U.S. Check this website out to see if the country you reside in is neutral or hostile toward bitcoin.  Did you link the account you go the tip from to changetip? (that's how you accept it)

Is there any plans to bring a native merchant app to the app store? My uncle doesn't really want to mess with webpages and wants it to be simple for employees to use.
@_date: 2014-05-08 22:17:40
Bits has now replaced doge. ;)
@_date: 2014-08-04 03:32:25
Yep.  I can't make it though.
@_date: 2014-09-30 00:42:27
It is. It should be standard. A web wallet without mandatory 2 factor is doomed for failure.
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:13:18
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:19:42
Two factor authentication. When you log into coinbase you need to put a code from your phone to log in. It's so people can't steal your bitcoin if they get a hold of your password. 
Here's a vid that explains and demonstrates it.  
@_date: 2014-01-30 22:07:21
I told a couple of friends that I know that go to Berkeley. Hopefully some of them go!
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:02:48
Not seeing it on my end. Maybe it's a roll out to specific users to see if anyone actually notices ha
@_date: 2014-10-23 03:33:10
Is bits weird to say around the world? Shall we change the term bitcoin too?
@_date: 2014-11-20 01:19:46
Why does it matter? The masses wouldn't use millibits anyway! Jusy don't say millibits when you use milli just say millibitcoin. There, problem solved.
@_date: 2014-11-16 06:38:34
If you were able to see my coinbase and circle transactions. They would all be buys since last December. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:36:34
Don't keep your bitcoin or fiat on it then. Exchange and withdraw!
@_date: 2014-08-28 06:58:41
I've been waiting 5 months... Still nothing 
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:13:51
Block size can be increased? It's low right now to avoid spam and other reasons.
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:27:46
Can't buy with bitcoin? Sorry, not buying if so.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:29:23
I'd be surprised if they didn't reimburse you. This is a PR nightmare for them. At least we know they have the funding to repay you and everyone else I guess. :/
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:41:51
Every time I see Ontario, I get excited and think someone finally accepted it in my city. Then I realize: Canada. :(
@_date: 2014-06-14 05:06:09
Sucks I can't install it. I'm on a jailbreaked iPhone 7.0.1, but cool!
@_date: 2014-07-23 08:01:47
Coinbase only does U.S. Only at the moment too
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:31:00
You probably switch to a light wallet that doesn't require you to download the whole blockchain. Try electrum?
@_date: 2014-03-23 04:57:50
It isn't easy to use. Like the early internet. The average joe didn't know how to use it and if they did it wasn't exactly the best experience.
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:54:16
I'm guessing just online if they do.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:43:50
They're gonna have withdrawal limits 
@_date: 2014-10-29 06:59:04
Up for me
@_date: 2014-12-11 02:21:00
You do know you just got tipped by and replied to the founder of changetip? ha
@_date: 2014-08-03 03:00:22
To bitcoin holders?
@_date: 2014-05-31 06:28:08
Where did you buy your Pi?
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:36:00
I had that as a step. :)
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:24:34
Phone 
@_date: 2014-08-17 00:04:40
Those are some cheap boobs. haha ;-)
@_date: 2014-10-03 18:14:48
Sure, what OS or device?
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:50:26
You and me both... 
@_date: 2014-01-18 06:43:11
Keep dreaming.
@_date: 2014-09-01 22:30:28
I don't see it being negative toward bitcoin at all, but toward the people taking advantage of the leaks to get bitcoin. That's how I read it.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:13:49
I thought addresses and user list were unencrypted? I wouldn't be worried for you. You'll probably be on a watch list though!
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:55:28
Just use a light wallet like electrum or download a mobile wallet. You don't need Bitcoin core.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:51:51
**LITERALLY JESUS. HE'S ALIVEEEEE!**
@_date: 2014-12-23 07:00:11
Aren't you the guy that tipped a lot of money away? Same thing? :P
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:23:42
We had mini-bubbles :c
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:13:08
This wallet has a huge share of users. Miners not accepting them would cause such a ruckus. I'd say the popular wallet Devs have a say in it too. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 03:01:43
I finally moved mine off coinbase. I always felt worried I'd get goxxed or someone would somehow bypass my passwords and 2FA. I feel much more relaxed now.
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:55:33
Someone tip him some on twitter :)
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:49:26
In my area too. Finally! Hope adoption increases 10x.. Not that many businesses here accepting it.
@_date: 2014-11-18 02:19:16
they're auctioning them in chunks
@_date: 2014-06-20 21:32:02
Here try it out. 200 bits works with twitter, reddit, and soon Facebook etc :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:59:03
Sounds over a 100k to someone overseas that can easily run with it? Sounds like he deserved to be scammed. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:33:06
Email them? Ask support what's wrong. Even call them they'll be more likely to reverse it and let it go through.
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:59:44
Unconfirmed tx? lol
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:10:10
Sure, same thing. He or she would be throwing away millions for what? Temporarily contesting the network? It becomes even harder to do this when miners start including any more transactions per block. It's a losing battle.
@_date: 2014-09-12 06:12:17
I'm a second year college student majoring in computer science. Do you think they'd even consider me for a support position? I would love to answer questions as a part time job. Working from my computer sounds nice. My world already revolves around bitcoin as it is and I'd rather have a job like this that is sort of in my field than work in the food industry. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:18:22
They also have DPr personal stash I think.
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:26:53
Sure thing, here's the repo if you haven't already found it. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:17:26
Need  moar women. The struggle. :P
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:58:33
I bought at $280. I can see us crashing into the low 200s just because I bought. Shit always happens. ha
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:51:28
Just used it the other day to convert some clam to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-11 19:12:37
Easier to sell? :P
@_date: 2014-08-28 07:24:44
How was it? Couldn't make it. Sorta far for me to drive an hour and a half for.
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:12:31
You still have the problem of the currencies we have right now being inflationary at will by whatever rate a group of people or government want them to be. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 04:17:17
Try something more local, like Hive on iOS or breadwallet.
@_date: 2014-04-10 07:11:37
400? 407 low here. Ah, I see it now.
@_date: 2014-06-29 05:34:05
Happy birthday! 500 bits @_date: 2014-03-25 09:42:16
Well I've asked through twitter and have gotten a no to accepting it as payment for minecraft due to all the issues it'd bring up through support. How about accepting bitcoin through gyft? You'd allow for gyft to sell minecraft gift cards like you do at various physical stores?
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:01:49
Everything is a good thing here on  @_date: 2014-10-13 03:39:49
Coinbase is an app you genius, if they didn't know how to open that or Bitpay why go through the trouble of using a single address piece of paper to look at a bookmarked page. They probably still wouldn't know that either. I'm not saying it's hard, but with an owner like that it'll never happen.
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:57:14
Wrong question. The real question is when do we not check the price?
@_date: 2014-10-31 04:11:57
You gotta start when they're young. haha I don't see anything wrong with it as long as there is candy involved too. I'd probably keep backups of the paperwallets as I'm sure most of the kids will either lose them or never redeem it. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:05:26
Eh, more time for me to buy more. +1
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:20:59
Most of the time I've seen it the other way around. Right now circle is more expensive by $1.20 when buying 1 bitcoin. I'll happily move back if this is consistent. ;) 
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:06:57
I've paid for thing in shops with bitcoin numerous times? (I can only count the number of times on one hand though) :(
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:12:30
The price will tank?
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:24:49
I'm following all of them already. Good suggestion in my book. +1
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:33:43
You should had it as I got goxed. P: jk Where'd you buy it?
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:34:06
I'm quite excited that they started this way. It allows for "legal" items to be sold first so it isn't seen as a drug platform right away.
@_date: 2014-08-23 04:18:54
Smart Property ASICs sound cool.Anyone in the industry developing something like that yet?
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:23:54
Thanks, didn't see it.
@_date: 2014-12-13 01:11:52


Whoa, surprised to see so many already taken near me!
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:41:01
I'm not sure if 1 dollar works. $1 does, though.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:56:01
Use bitaddress with a pass code. Print those and you can keep sending as much as you want to the public address. Preferably print more than one and have them in different locations etc.
@_date: 2014-08-07 21:23:04
You can trade them for bitcoin I think.
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:33:24
You get tipped and play with the small amount you get in order to get a feel of what you are getting into. :) 500 bits @_date: 2014-02-27 08:26:03

@_date: 2014-06-29 01:59:16
Cool! Download the coinbase merchant app. First million in sales do not cost anything to convert. Please post your location on coinmap and other places so us bitcoiners know where to go. :) 300 bits @_date: 2014-07-31 21:48:36
Here, I'll give you some to start off with. 600 bits :) 1 million bits = 1 BTC 
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:37:36
Wtf apple....
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:40:03
If there aren't many takers at the very least it can be a conversation starter if she's comfortable explaining it. Gotta get more of the ladies involved!
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:43:53
Mine is $600. It'd be the same as yours if level 2 verification worked for me on coinbase haha
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:06:13
Maybe he means verification? I have trouble with that too for some odd reason
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:37:41
Get out with what. Lmao hahaha
@_date: 2014-08-20 19:50:34
Like I ask every person when did you sign up haha?
@_date: 2014-10-03 06:18:07
Move to a local wallet please. You will never have downtime. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:48:58
Most of them are not even paid.. I think Gavin is the only one paid anything?
@_date: 2014-08-02 02:51:46
Here's a blog post from twitch about it. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:01:16
I had this issue using chrome,  but it loaded fine on Firefox.
@_date: 2014-08-08 16:53:13
You only have to do this once.
@_date: 2014-11-17 21:11:37
It already is?
@_date: 2014-04-14 02:44:54
Grow up man. It's not conforming, it's being realistic.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:58:21
If it were really him, I'd be scared to leave the house alone. Although, I doubt he'd be stupid enough to leave the private keys out in the open or even in his home.
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:31:26
No. It's a node.
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:35:39
Did you read the discussion?
@_date: 2014-09-18 07:29:41
I've grown numb. I feel worried about losing other people's money that got into bitcoin because of me, though.
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:50:53
Me too ha
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:08:22
Recording of this anywhere?
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:38:09
Blockchain proof or I won't believe. :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:09:57
They're not an exchange, so they don't really need to follow all the regulations an exchange like Kraken would.
@_date: 2014-03-13 05:47:42
Negative? I receive bitcoin ads from Facebook?
@_date: 2014-10-29 05:19:14
What a lurker.
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:09:58
 It's a state school, I didn't really expect you guys to include it so eh.. Wish you did.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:27:52
I'll probably just download a vanilla linux os and do it from there.
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:29:28
Yeah, then we forked.
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:26:48
I agree. I actually un-followed him because of that. Everyone the this lists is fine though.
@_date: 2014-10-31 07:18:44
Smells like a scam to me. No contact info for any employees. Nada, zip. They're also tweeting all the well known bitcoiners on Twitter. I'd like to see a face from this company hopefully before or launches or I'm calling scam 
@_date: 2014-05-19 05:44:17
That's what I thought when we were stuck in the 800s range a few months ago. :P
@_date: 2014-09-30 03:56:36
I'm guessing he's not moving there only traveling..? 
@_date: 2014-12-08 01:52:15
Was there but left! Have you used it yet? It was slow and lagged a bit on some parts. I was able to buy $20 worth but when I tried verifying after it either froze or kept loading so I canceled verification. I hope all the kinks get worked out. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 06:13:37
Yet. They will all be terminated. The PBOC does not fuck around.
@_date: 2014-07-03 16:54:18
He is hilarious! Nice to see him accept it. :)
@_date: 2014-12-28 06:27:07
Can confirm. Sold $50 worth as I needed it and it came the next day. It took 3/4 days to deposit on buttercoin, though. (part of that being because of Christmas)
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:35:00
For now.
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:05:14
The tips aren't recorded on the bitcoin blockchain. They are done off the blockchain so you can send fee-less transactions over reddit/twitter etc. Once you try to send to a bitcoin address or withdraw from changetip then there is the 100 bits transaction fee.
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:56:34
We can't have people tipping 50 cents it could be used for terrorism or money laundering right? What a joke.
50 cents You're not from NY right? ;)
@_date: 2014-05-17 22:06:46
I've always felt Lamassu ATMs were the best. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 18:17:30
Not everyone owns a whole coin. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:05:05
Message them, I've read around here that if you message them to not cancel it they'll whitelist you or something so it doesn't happen again.
@_date: 2014-12-13 02:00:06
Installed back in February ;) 
Another one here too.
  
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:05:41
Which will probably dip after a few weeks.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:56:31
Less fees!
@_date: 2014-06-25 21:46:15
Won't let me view on mobile for some reason :(
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:22:49
It's not set in stone, if setting the price for the day doesn't work out for them they will be forced to adapt.

Welcome to the community! 500 bits @_date: 2014-06-08 00:43:27
Where can I buy this article? I like to keep newspapers or magazines that have bitcoin on the cover. (old school, I know)
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:45:57
I grabbed a three letter one ha. 500 bits @_date: 2014-11-20 01:27:33
I think it's cool. Oh no, I used slang. You won't know if I'm saying it cold or if it's awesome. The horror!
@_date: 2014-11-15 05:06:19
What have you tried?
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:06:58
I've become immune. xD
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:48:38
Do you have another copy? That might be worth more in the future if you didn't open it.
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:14:19
They're coming out with an update. I wonder how that's going to work out. :l
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:12:20
You mean the B with a line stuck up its ass?
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:53:04
Mensa means stupid in Spanish so I was confused for a sec haha
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:58:27
Leaving a comment to save this for later. :) (on mobile)
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:03:32
Does the watch have nfc? Tap my watch to pay sounds sweet.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:18:51
Someone tip this guy some fake magic internet money through twitter! I enjoyed the show. Glad to see some humor  after all the bad news.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:40:49
Negative 
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:13:16
Has anyone here actually received an invite yet?
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:54:14
Where do you live? There are trustworthy brokerages or exchanges. Mt.Gox used to be the biggest as it's one of the oldest, but was going downhill for months. If you live in the U.S. use coinbase with your bank. Coinbase is located in San Francisco. If you prefer to pay in cash check out localbitcoins.com
Redditor for ten months with no comments? What a lurker. ;)
@_date: 2014-08-24 16:55:11
You can still donate. A lot of the devs post on the subreddit.
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:32:55
How do you guys handle paying with bitcoin if there a ton of customers trying to buy at once? Or can just pay to a tab with it?
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:23:21
Spread the word! :P It won't grow if you keep to yourself.
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:03:17
It was for me when I was 14 years old. Not everyone has wealthy parents giving their children hundreds of dollars.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:49:59
There are some in development so hopefully you don't have to wait that long ;)
@_date: 2014-03-19 07:19:30
Found the fake: 
More followers(prob fake) than the real  
@_date: 2014-09-09 06:45:44
If centralized it's dead on arrival. If decentralized maybe a few would be willing to use it. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 03:53:51
New account... Try  You can buy and sell with circle and send and receive bitcoin too. If you need any help just feel free to reply and ask. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 21:44:46
Finally! I'm loving the influx of bitcoin wallets on the App Store. :)
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:09:18
If he did that, Bitcoin would plummet so much in value that all the coins he stole would not be worth much.
@_date: 2014-10-03 01:03:05
Google plus did that and it failed!
@_date: 2014-08-12 23:30:59
What wallet do you use?
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:10:01
Sweet! :) I know the user experience isn't where it should be, but it should get more simple to use as time passes. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:37:30
This news has spread like wildfire. I think he would have noticed even if he doesn't lurk.
@_date: 2014-06-29 00:55:19
Soon tm. 200 bits :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:09:54
Mine were missing too..
@_date: 2014-08-25 20:48:42
Watch them replace the payment processor with their own. Goodbye Bitcoin integration.
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:17:09
They sorta flirted with the idea of it a few months back, never really got around to it until now.
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:31:12
Now this is good news.
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:24:15
Are you selling if Gox opens up and it shoots up to 600?
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:29:34
50k could be mostly comprised of stores that are online only. I think 3k of them are brick and mortar stores.
@_date: 2014-01-15 08:05:40
Nice! 
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:00:03
Download mycelium! 
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:49:57
That really sucks. I haven't lost anything yet, but I dread the day I make a mistake an do. 300 bits @_date: 2014-10-06 00:09:10
Did you ignore that and try to link a credit card?
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:25:26
As do I, but not like this.
@_date: 2014-07-01 01:30:07
Do you know what would be even more awesome? If Tigerdirect got a Lamassu ATM at everyone one of their retail stores. That would be huge.
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:45:54

They use coinbase, but you don't need coinbase to buy something from them. Just use your wallet and scan the qr code or copy the address provided to your wallet that's provided at checkout.

That doesn't sound better. Take a poll?

Note that they don't use your cc, they only have it just in case you don't have enough cash on your bank account. There's also circle. You can try getting an invite.. It's $500 instant per week through circle.

It's easy to make this cheap. Some company could provide a service that hashes thousands of hashes so people taking pictures around the world would be connected to a couple of hashes every ten minutes making it less expensive. Proof of hash of your hash and the others in the pool would of course be needed to verify that it was indeed put into a block, there could also be a backup option where you make the transaction on the blockchain yourself if the centralized approach is down or acts malicious or if it's a time sensitive picture/video. Does that make sense? (I have no idea what I'm talking about btw)
@_date: 2014-10-07 02:01:52
Are you sure? This needs more visibility.
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:58:59
Id buy way more if it hit $90 I doubt it will ever hit that. Unless it flash crashed or another coin was taking over.

They've had it up for a while? I think since the last big bundle.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:32:54
This is temporary. We're moving to floating fees so there wouldn't be a need to change the the amount of transaction fees again as it would scale on it's own as the price and use rise. Currently it's  a hardcoded value as far as I know, meaning the higher the price of a bitcoin the higher the transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:11:00
IMO we need more infrastructure/adoption for it to go that high, but I do think it's possible.

@_date: 2014-09-03 18:02:41
You can still instant buy if you hook up your credit card... (only to $100 which is what I said, it's more if you can get level 2 verified)
It's level 2 verification that I've had problems with for months. 
Literally everything else is complete.

Circle lets you instant buy up to $500. I'd go with them if you're not detected by their fraud detection algorithm if you need the coin soon. If not try coinbase! They're both great.

@_date: 2014-04-14 04:01:28
In what way does having regulated exchanges in which you can send money directly from you bank online manipulate or dictate your life so that you can't exchange fiat for bitcoin privately in person? You would still do it, even if they outlaw it. What changes? 
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:17:06
Why don't you just buy 5k on coinbase.com? Or do you really prefer paying in cash. Coinbase is based in the U.S. and has been trustworthy to most users. They now almost have 1 million users.
@_date: 2014-08-19 04:48:21
That's a good thing. There is incentive to not fuck up and review and audit changes as to not introduce major bugs.

Sure thing! What are doing to get them? If you're clicking on advertisements to get a small bit of them it really isn't worth it. But if you're doing a job, like say designing a website or something someone requested I would say it's worth it if you have that skill set for the job: Personally, I just set a portion of the money I make from work and buy whatever I can weekly from coinbase. :)

@_date: 2014-03-27 22:29:25
You're joking right?
@_date: 2014-11-03 05:40:44
Honestly, no. By the time you get your funds in bitcoin the price may have dipped or gone up being the difference whether you get your computer or not. On circle you can buy up to $500 on circle instantly, so unless you're buying a computer under $500 I wouldn't do it. Buying past $500 on circle you'd have to wait for your bank deposit to clear with them which could be a few days to a week. If you buy something smaller on tigerdirect I'd recommend it. I just don't want you to get burned. If you do end up waiting, just  understand the risk!
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:40:59
Yeah? Through greenaddress? Instant confirmation. Or you could wait around for 10 minutes.

I guess I've sold that way, but I'd usually buy more after spending it.
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:40:27
It may be their fraud detection system flagging you for buying so little. (Dumb for people that just want to buy a bit right?) The reason being people with stolen credit cards would first buy a little and see if the owner recognized it and then go on an max out on the card. Try out coinbase.com if circle doesn't work out with verification. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 05:32:53
If they did the price would jump up by a shit load. No one would sell cheap.
@_date: 2014-10-28 03:26:02
Not even close. I sent newbies some bits on breadwallet, and they get all excited that I send a few thousand. That's when I explain that 1 million bits = 1 bitcoin. It all makes sense to them. If they inquire more I say dealing in decimals is confusing and that the switch was led to get rid of the confusion that you can only buy one whole bitcoin.

I'm not advocating it. Sure you have a choice, good luck actually changing the system. We're the minority. Maybe in the long term slowly, but the way our government is I don't see them being lax on exchanging fiat they print without regulation. No way in hell they're going to give up that power. I'm actually surprised that the gov. isn't as aggressive toward exchanging fiat for bitcoin as China. Maybe when it starts to challenge the dollar(if it ever gets to that point) they will. At that point in my opinion I hope it will be too late.
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:53:04

Quickest? You get tipped 600 bits as for buying I recommend coinbase if you live in the U.S. Remember to enable 2FA for both your email and coinbase account! 
You can also connect your credit card for instant buys after you connect your bank account so you don't have to wait a few days to receive the bitcoin. (It think it takes a while to get to that level though, you can't instant buy right away, I think)

@_date: 2014-06-16 05:28:45
Don't do this. Since you're doing one paycheck of bitcoin per month you can do a recurring buy on coinbase every week. Don't buy a paychecks worth all at once. Just do you paycheck/4, and that's how much you would buy weekly. Putting a paychecks worth a month remember to have 2FA on both coinbase and the email you use with it.

You wouldn't keep your life savings or thousands of fiat in your wallet would you? Same concept. You only put what you need or going to use on your computer or phone and put the rest on a paper wallet in a safe or something.

Breadwallet. It's a local wallet requiring no email. All you need to do is install it and copy down the phrase it gives you to recover your funds if you lose your phone. Simple as that.

EDIT: This no longer works for electrum 2.0!
So first create a new wallet on electrum. It'll create a seed you can copy down. Write this down and keep it somewhere safe!
Go on bitcoin qt -&gt; click on help -&gt; click on debug window -&gt; click on Console...
I'm not sure how many addresses you generated but you can type:
dumpprivkey "your address here"
The address being the money you sent to from LocalBitcoins, if you have other addresses with bitcoin you'll have to repeat this.
If you have your bitcoin-qt encrypted type this into the console before using the dumpprivkey command:
 walletpassphrase "your password here without quotes " 100
Okay so it will give you a private key you can copy and paste into electrum.
Go back into Electrum -&gt; Click on Wallet toolbar -&gt; click on Private Keys -&gt; Click on *Sweep -&gt; paste private key from the bitcoin qt console.
Now in the send tab in electrum you can send from the address you just imported by right clicking the old address -&gt; send from -&gt; copy a newly generated address from electrum and send to that.. Now your seed will be able to recover those funds if your computer shuts down etc.
Sorry if it's too confusing and long. Not user friendly at all. :( Hope it helps, if not then I'll try to be more specific.

Both, let's say you send bitcoin to an invalid address. You just distributed that amount's worth to everyone else holding bitcoin since they were destroyed.
@_date: 2014-12-02 07:46:16
Did you have 2fa enabled with a good password and your email with 2fa as well? I wouldn't say it's LB fault unless you had all that enabled. As for an alternative you can try bitfinex? Last I heard if you deposit coin you can trade with little to no verification and withdraw your profits in bitcoin. If you mean sell locally if you have an android phone you can sell locally with Mycelium's local trader.

No gold? I'll post anyway.. I want to better the world by spreading the word of crypto. I know I probably can't do much myself but I'm planning on starting a bitcoin club on my college campus and going to a few other meet-ups myself. I'll try applying for the circle student thing. Hopefully that'll pick up and get at least more people in involved in my campus who in turn will get other people in involved. Change starts small.
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:00:39
You got the core client which downloads every block which contains every transaction made on bitcoin since its inception. It will take a long time to get it in sync. Try downloading  This client is much more user friendly as its easy to recover funds and you don't need to download the whole blockchain.. You can import your keys to this client following my rough step by step guide if you're up for it. Otherwise you'll have to wait for it to sync which will take days.

You can reverse a credit card payment. You can't reverse a bitcoin transaction after it's confirmed. (Very unlikely) There are a couple of companies that allow you to buy with a cc but I don't see how they would avoid the issue of chargebacks in the long run.

@_date: 2014-02-10 00:42:07
Personally I prefer buying stuff from companies online that don't convert to their local currencies. One bad thing I've noticed is that I really don't want to spend any bitcoin when the price is down 10% from when I bought some. On the flip side if it's up a few percent I happily spend some as I know the price could go down. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:27:33
Just wait until the fed auctions of their supply of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:45:47
Technically with some changes we'd be fine if all but one were or a part of one lost. We'd all just be holding or own a very small part of that Bitcoin as they're divisible.

No $500 is only the instant limit. You can buy much more than that in a week. 2.5k buying and 5k selling through a bank account. Well you're right about there being a $500 limit for debit/cc for everyone else using it who are not in the U.S.

My brother forgot his wallet at home today. He has a food market near his university that accepts bitcoin. For some reason he didn't ask? He didn't have much bitcoin on him at the time so he didn't end up going... I told him I could seriously pay for his meal sitting at home when I picked him up. He didn't know I could do that. It blew his mind.

You're adding to the circle spam. I've been using them for a few months and I'm not worried. I don't keep my coins on them anyway. I buy and move them to a wallet I control. You really think circle is a scam? 
@_date: 2014-09-05 06:00:11
I recommend breadwallet instead. It's a local wallet. You can import and it's not dependent on any third party servers to send or receive transactions like the blockchain wallet is. All you have to do is remember the backup phrase to recover your funds if you lose your phone. It's also really simple and straightforward to use. I recommend it to all iOS users now. (Bitwallet is nice, but closed source)
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:25:19
Touch ID doesn't store any images of your fingerprint. It stores only a mathematical representation of your fingerprint. It isn't possible for your actual fingerprint image to be reverse-engineered from this mathematical representation. iPhone 5s also includes a new advanced security architecture called the Secure Enclave within the A7 chip, which was developed to protect passcode and fingerprint data. Fingerprint data is encrypted and protected with a key available only to the Secure Enclave. Fingerprint data is used only by the Secure Enclave to verify that your fingerprint matches the enrolled fingerprint data. The Secure Enclave is walled off from the rest of A7 and the rest of iOS. Therefore, your fingerprint data is never accessed by iOS or other apps, never stored on Apple servers, and never backed up to iCloud or anywhere else. Only Touch ID uses it, and it can't be used to match against other fingerprint databases. Source:

How so? For example, I like doge as it introduces a new audience to crypto. Doge and its community got me into bitcoin as it did a ton of other people. Other crypto such as Vertcoin provide improvements to become ASIC resistant. I'm not being dismissive of all altcoins. So no, case not made.

I have. I've introduced Bitcoin to non-techie friends using the unit bits and it makes sense. It also excited a few when I send a few thousand.

I just went the other day. The owner uses coinbase so he may keep a percentage of it. They use a tablet and run the coinbase app to accept it. You had to put the price yourself so it wasn't the best experience, but I emailed the owner and he said he was looking to update the POS to something more user friendly. (and all in one etc) (To clarify: I had a girl working alone when I went, she knew to turn on the tablet and go to app, so it wasn't THAT bad)

I agree that it is currently too difficult for the layman to use securely. But devices like Trezor that improve on this. There will surely be companies competing in making Trezor like devices simpler and simpler to use in order for the layman to securely be able to use bitcoin.

I got a part-time job now and am on break and have been buying bitcoin weekly. I don't have a lot with how much I make, but I'm buying and holding what I can. I don't try to play the market and sell, I know I'd lose in the end that way. To start you off I'll tip you some myself. :) 400 bits Obligatory (only invest/convert what you can afford to lose)
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:11:41
Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-11-15 05:11:25
Try localbitcoins?
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:10:19
Nope, think of it like this. You send changetip some money to keep in their wallet. They have their own ledger that they keep track of when you send other people tips so they can make them fee-less. So none of what you tipped is saved on the blockchain, the only transaction being what you sent to changetip in the first place.

At the very most they won't take away the ability to buy gift cards via bitcoin through gyft, that's reassuring! 
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:27:31
Bitcoin is a private currency. In the U.S. these are legal. Heck, the government is auctioning off thousands of bitcoin(worth millions) that they seized when they shut down silk road. They wouldn't do that if it were illegal? Here, I'll give you a bit to play with. 300 bits @_date: 2014-03-19 00:03:49
As long as there is no premine and is an improvement over bitcoin I am too. (Although, I haven't really read up much about zerocoin specifically, so I can't say for sure on zerocoin specifically.)

Sucks. Hopefully the more requests they get in accepting it the more seriously they'll consider it. I asked Ancestry and got a troll reply, "We'd prefer gold coin. Doesn't fluctuate in vie as much. :)" Honestly all it takes is for one the companies to accept it to put it on the radar for all the others. Time to ask FTDNA..

It is, but it's better than nothing. I'm not disagreeing with you.
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:01:49
Yep! Coinbase has a recurring buy feature. I would recommend spacing it out to at least once a week. I believe you get charged for a bank transfer every time you buy on coinbase for example. It's not much, but can add up.

If you're a very infrequent user you'd have to d/l from where you left off and might take a while if you haven't booted it up for a few weeks try another wallet like electrum so there is no need to download the whole thing.
On a side note:
This is why bitcoin core should be shown for advanced users on bitcoin.org.. Having it shown as the first in the list for nobbies just adds confusion and puts a ton of people off having to wait weeks to download the whole blockchain.  
@_date: 2014-06-14 05:06:49

I think it's bad and good that he got caught. It shows that criminals can still be caught with current regulations, but bad as the media will surely blow it up equating bitcoin with drugs and money laundering without focusing on the positives.

I think you got the wrong idea, I agree with "The only naive thing to think is that you need the government to regulate free exchanges between consenting individuals." But realistically try starting up your own unregulated fiat to crypto vice versa exchange here in the U.S. You're gonna get fucked by the government, I guarantee it. No way in hell Congress or regulators will give up their power and just give you a free ride. Baby steps man. They can't fuck with decentralized crypto to crytpo exchanges. I'd rather we pick up adoption with regulation, so we get to a point were we can live off using crypto. Government can ban the decentralized crypto exchanges, but good luck with them enforcing that.

You paint the picture as if we have a choice? Try fighting back, you'll still get raped. It's government fiat we're talking about here. In crypto land when exchanging between other cryptos there are realistic solutions to do this without the need for regulation or government, thus no rape.  Decentralized crypto exchanges are feasible, I don't think that can happen with fiat without getting raped by the government. :) It's not conforming. It's being fucken realistic.

Seriously? They're trying to cut down on fraud by verifying you so fraudsters don't use stolen credit cards to steal bitcoin from circle. What do you expect from a company here in the U.S. to give you the green light to buy bitcoin with false info?  Might as well just use LBC if you don't want to give up info?

They're actually cheaper in my experience. The quoted price is what you get on circle give or take a few bits. Have you totaled up the price with fees on coinbase and compared them?
@_date: 2014-11-24 02:10:41
You can port it over to a new coin or have it on a side chain. So no. It makes sense to have it built on the biggest and most secure coin we have right now.

@_date: 2014-06-15 02:13:32
Exactly!If it was 2 of 3 address, greenaddress would not be able to provide this. You would be able to double spend by signing another transaction with your third key with a higher fee to a different address. Well that's how I understand it.

@_date: 2014-03-31 08:55:05
I know many are against it, but what people don't understand is that most people (average joe) at the moment would rather have a central authority to hold them and handle the security.  While they may prefer that, we all have the choice to not do so, and keep all our coins secure and to ourselves. Hopefully that changes, though. :l

Try out coinbase.com or circle.com, they both allow you to buy and sell bitcoin and are also a web wallet. I'd recommend you moving them out to a local wallet if you buy some! What kind of phone do you have? Try out breadwallet.com if you have an iPhone or  on Android.
@_date: 2014-10-01 23:29:15
I hate this argument. You can also sell at that exact same exchange rate back at circle.

You should use another wallet. It isn't really user friendly to use the one that downloads the entire blockchain. Try electrum. edit: I believe you can import the wallet.dat into electrum, although I'd still backup the wallet.dat before moving or changing anything on your computer. That way you don't need to wait for the whole blockchain to sync.
@_date: 2014-10-02 00:15:51
You have to be 18+ to use circle. You don't at an ATM. Right?

You think your crazy obsessive over bitcoin now I can't even imagine if you or I invested 25k into it. It would drive me insane. I would freak out over the smallest dump. I really don't think this is a good idea if I were in your situation. The price may go up in time, but man you have other people depending on you. As long as losing all that money doesn't, put your kids at risk of going homeless then maybe, but it's still risky as hell... Hopefully you think this through more before doing something huge like this... I'm not even comfortable telling family or encouraging them to drop thousands of dollars into it. A few are interested and even asked if they should, but I really would hate for it to bite me back later if they lose money.

Breadwallet has its specific use case as a wallet. Circle has specifically in buying instantly cheaper (before I was able to be fully verified on coinbase) Coinbase is still so much better overall in it's utility, but I've moved my buying elsewhere. Competition is good, it'll make coinbase even better. :)

I also heard New York was planning in requiring businesses to obtain a license to allow bitcoin to be used as payment. Doesn't that create a barrier? I don't know many small businesses that would be willing dish out a lot of money to obtain a license. In my opinion it stifles adoption.

It is if you know how. It is complicated ath the moment though, but in the long run it will be for the end user. I'm waiting on the trezor and future stupid proof secure hardware wallets that follow it. For those that want insurance there are companies that will fill that void, although sure at the moment there aren't many or any? Why would there be, that would only come if bitcoin were to become mainstream as there wouldn't be much money to make off it right now. (in my biased opinion)

@_date: 2014-11-03 02:56:12
You could send millions of transactions to yourself. Try it. You'd need to pay the fees, though. If you try sending zero fee transactions in the tune of millions, the nodes on the network would not relay them to other nodes. So no it wouldn't DDoS the blockchain.

@_date: 2014-12-11 20:53:50
Basically, if you buy on circle.com or coinbase.com and leave your bitcoin there they control your bitcoin. As in if they went bankrupt or someone hacked them your bitcoin would be lost as you don't have exclusive control of them. If you moved them to a local wallet, the bitcoin is stored on that device or in a backup that the wallet tells you to make so that only you have the ability to use them.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

You can manually import the keys into electrum to use them? It gets sorta technical though.
 
I helped this guy do it if you're interested in how. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 22:24:30
Think of Doge as our PR wing.. A lot of users from dogecoin go on and move to bitcoin or at the very least start to use both. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:30:16
Do you not understand... They can't be optional without the risk of being shut down or thrown in jail. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 07:19:16
I wonder if he keeps it in bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:25:14
I've never had an issue with them.
@_date: 2014-05-26 07:16:50
Or you could spread out your buys.
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:01:26
Maybe I'll finally cave in and buy and .io domain :)
@_date: 2014-11-02 05:55:26
What do you mean? The seed or passphrase isn't on the phone. It's just a reminder to remember it....?
@_date: 2014-06-04 19:55:15
I understand what you mean. Basically, you open your wallet to a qr code (unique every time) which gives the scanner the info to make a payment request to your wallet (could be time limited) which then asks you to confirm the amount. Basically the payment protocol, but in reverse kinda.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:58:54
Why didn't you withdraw? Recent investment?
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:38:10
@_date: 2014-06-29 05:46:32
Whatever you want. Your choice. :)
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:25:36
All these choices. It's beautiful.
@_date: 2014-09-10 19:30:36
Seriously switch over to a local wallet.(breadwallet) Remember the backup phrase and you'll always have access to send your funds or recover them.      
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:20:33
I don't see it. On the other hand I don't exactly use this account for an xbox or windows live and have never made a payment on it so if they were doing a test run on a range of users I probably wouldn't be included in that. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 05:34:37
Not ebay. Uber and Airbnb mostly. Now we know why Airbnb doesn't accept it yet. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:19:15
You planted a seed. Others helped water it. 200 bits :)
@_date: 2014-09-19 22:58:15
24? Wouldn't it be 21
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:34:11
Whoa, thanks man! I'll be sure to pass most of it on. :)
@_date: 2014-04-21 08:46:17
you really should be rebooting into a fresh operating system 
@_date: 2014-08-19 08:01:22
I hope they don't. It's confusing enough as it is with one coin.
@_date: 2014-07-20 07:34:29
 I wouldn't really know how else you would buy some there. That's the best I got. Not sure if there are many Mycelium users that are selling bitcoin on the local trader feature.
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:21:08
Wow. Gox needs to die already.
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:43:24
My friends also told me it was brought up in an econ class at UCLA. My classmate at my school also said the teacher brought it up in her econ class and said they would discuss it later. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:32:40
I heard it wasn't allowed in.
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:27:42
I guess some trade offs are needed. Your wallet is simple and not too complex. Cluttering it up with advance settings etc wouldn't be good a good UX for people new to crypto. 👍
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:42:32
Export the keys. Want help? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:31:33
I emailed both the state senator and assembly member. Thanks for the link and post.
@_date: 2014-12-29 00:39:16
Change it to the last 12 months and you can't barely tell. :/ 
@_date: 2014-11-04 05:07:34
Of course! You could also use ble if you don't have an nfc enabled device. 
Here's someone using btc with nfc. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:28:51
DrugeReport? Can you tell me why I should care if it's headlined there? (not being  sarcastic, never heard of it before and it looks like a really old site) 
@_date: 2014-07-01 01:14:40
Only 30? Time to double that. 300 bits (derp)
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:02:58
Which is why we shouldn't tell newbies to use it.
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:32:24
Good to know thanks. 500 bits @_date: 2014-02-22 07:46:53
I emailed gedmatch to take donations via bitcoin. I really want to donate to them, but not with a credit card. I just had another site take money out of my card and I have to pay it either way.. :l 
@_date: 2014-09-19 08:15:37
Some wallets do this automatically. It would be a bad user experience if they didn't. If you have an iOS device. Breadwallet does it automatically. Creating and displaying a new address every time an address receives or sends money. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:38:34
Guessing that you need a bank account for that 
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:51:43
Is my opinion wrong? Most altcoins are created as quick rich schemes for the creators of the altcoin, but I do recognize there being a few that are beneficial to bitcoin or crytpocurrency in general. That is not being dismissive of altcoins. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 08:52:48
Not yet?

I opened a regular account at Wells Fargo as my teen account expired and they seriously thought I bought my driver's license at L.A. What a joke. I terminated my account with them. Fuck that.
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:26:41
I failed my first one. My grandma had both last names so it was either or...  I've tried for months. Still can't. Maybe it'll work today... hmmm edit: It did. Glad I didn't jinx it.
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:08:04
Check the source?
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:39:57
For better or worse.
@_date: 2014-04-13 02:20:44
Then don't use a wallet that downloads the entire blockchain? Use something like electrum or blockchain.info.
@_date: 2014-08-18 19:45:28
Know when the next one is?
@_date: 2014-07-27 05:56:43
The company seems nice. They invited me over to check out their ATMs or whatever they were working on. I didn't go due to not having time to drive over there, but will someday.
@_date: 2014-06-22 23:56:00
Try out bitwallet. You can print out a paper wallet directly from it. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:31:33
You can steal coins with weak private keys? Are you full of shit? It's like story after story of bc.info fucking up and you're still shilling for them.
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:59:29
I see you like in every new thread..xD Well maybe they're doing this to  increase volume? *cough* 
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:29:00
I'd certainly run it. Although, I'd be a bit worried of malware being added on.
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:51:24
As in try sending the bitcoin I tipped you to your coinbase wallet from the changetip site. If you buy a bit buying something on newegg is also a good learning experience. (there are limits and delays on receiving the bitcoin on coinbase to prevent fraud so that could take a few days)
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:48:15
More than 70% of the code has been rewritten.....
@_date: 2014-11-29 06:48:47
A story? Can I make I'll make it up. One day I was dreaming... I woke up like normal and checked my phone. Bitcoin was dead. The price was at 0 with all exchanges being shut down and nodes not relaying transactions. That was actually a nightmare and I woke up to see the price at 1 million per coin. How crazy I thought, but then I woke up to see the price crash from $1,000 to where we are now at $380.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:12:34
It took me a while, but I found it on the front page. I don't use Yahoo either.
@_date: 2014-12-14 08:19:48
Tell Coinbase you want the money the bank sent back into your usd wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:26:32
Not dead yet. More like it's on life support.
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:08:30
Request a circle invite. Ask your parents if they'd let you use their debit or credit card to purchase whatever amount you want. Do you have older friends or family? You can also buy some with cash on localbitcoins. Although, if you meet someone do not go alone. Go with an older family member or friend so you're safe.(in a public location) $2 @_date: 2014-05-29 20:31:28
Infiltrate companies from the inside I see. :)
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:23:52
No problem! As other people recommended I would use Mycelium on your Android phone. Remember to follow the backup directions before putting any money however small on it. :)
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:38:21
I've bought from them. The quality isn't great, but I think it's still pretty good for the price. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:32:48
Good to know! 200 bits @_date: 2014-03-13 21:08:12
Off chain transactions?
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:42:15
Some people want to buy it without having to worry about storing them securely themselves. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 04:51:26
I can't get verified either. I've been trying for months. Although, I have a cc from Bank of America, not Chase.
@_date: 2014-11-20 01:52:53
Guess I'm just a hipster for preferring bits before that. There were also people pestering companies to switch to bits and other alternatives at the time so it wasn't as if they pulled bits out of no where. Bitpay thought bits was the best out of the worst and I'm glad they picked that over the alternatives we had. I don't see anything wrong with it. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:09:17
Most people don't have enough to warrant purchasing one. I ponder buying one but then make the decision I'd rather buy more bitcoin instead of buying a trezor for the small amount I have. I'm perfectly fine with having distributed password protected paper wallets for now. Even then for what I have even that seems a bit excessive. ha
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:18:26
I'd go the  route then if you're that paranoid and pay with cash. It's much more of a hassle at the moment as you have to make sure you're not being scammed and you have to know how to work a wallet. There are currently no bitcoin ATMs available to the public in California. I personally use coinbase as I live in the SoCal and they're backed by investors in Silicon Valley. Webmoney???
@_date: 2014-05-08 06:37:06
What about a tall nerd?
@_date: 2014-04-13 04:21:52
Find out the BTC ATM fee first. Edit:(less than 1% cool)
@_date: 2014-10-31 04:04:16
That logic. Digitally you can split up a dollar into a billion to the trillionth place. Heck venmo could do it if they wanted to. Does that mean more value is created ? No, and that's what matters as there will only be an upper limit of 21 million bitcoin. I find it a net positive that you could split up a bitcoin into that many units. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:28:56
The bitcoin wallet on android recently lowered the fee to ten bits too. Keep in mind that the blockchian app probably sent the transaction with dust in included that kept the transaction in limbo. Sending with a 10bit fee is fine for most transactions right now. The fee shouldn't be that high right now anyway with how big the subsidy is.
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:04:14
Maybe they were pressuring for this?
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:38:20
Only if there is interest from the employees themselves!

They don't keep up with the news the way obsessively do.  They read or hear about a bankruptcy and automatically think it's dead or on it's way down.
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:25:30
You just one up'd circle!
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:56:37
I don't know. Circle is at 1 BTC = $303.49, don't know why Coinbase brought it up.

500 bits (messed up the syntax on my last reply) 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:42:41
Even if you jailbreak. The blockchain info wallet on cydia sucks. As far as I know it still charges the old fee and looks ugly.
@_date: 2014-12-08 01:56:31
My friend messaged me today asking if I knew about the bitcoin bowl since he's a big college football fan... Nice to know the advertising money from bitpay are being put to good use.

It is! 500 bits @_date: 2014-03-07 02:11:36
Tell them in what way does accepting bitcoin hurt them? It doesn't cost them anything to have the option up? 
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:59:41
Remember that these are your bitcoin. I'd give some to your friend personally as a thanks for running it, but I'd keep some of it myself. :)

Remember to save the secret key somewhere safe!
Send your bitcoin to addresses generated by electrum. You can test small amounts until you feel comfortable you'll be able to restore and use your funds.
Remember to set a password!
@_date: 2014-07-02 04:01:23
It's much harder than that. To be safe with a considerable amount of money they need to do it on a safe offline machine. My parents only have one computer... Oh wait they can burn a DVD for a bootable live CD? They've never done that or used Linux. They then have to generate a paper wallet and print it? Then send bitcoin to it? Then store it safely? I don't think my dad would go through that if I weren't there. He understands how bitcoin works in the rough sense, but not from a very technical standpoint. Now if all he or my mom has to do is buy a share off a brokerage account. Now that's easy especially if they're already investing in other things. So no, it makes a lot of sense right now.
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:12:08
It may have had nothing to do with the conversation he had with him about bitcoin, unless he instead decided to invested 600k into something bitcoin related I really doubt it had anything to do with him.
@_date: 2014-08-07 02:00:05
My brother's girlfriend is currently at MIT for some program for a week or more and I told her to ask an undergrads if they know about the free $100 worth of bitcoin and what he was going to do with it. You're pretty spot on based on the first response she got. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:57:15
That's actually one of the best ways to minimize your risk if the price takes a sudden drop. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:55:02
Got it too, sweet. It's a little more than a dollars worth right?
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:06:50
They could upgrade it to include cashing out. :)
@_date: 2014-12-08 04:23:32
I suspect most of those that created an order didn't actually have any bitcoin and were turned off since it is still so hard to get bitcoin instantly without having to wait a few days or without insane verification.

Bread wallet. Why include a third party sending backups to your email when you can just write down a phrase to backup your money? It'll also still work when blockchain.info or other wallet's servers go down. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:04:44
Multiple locations too.
@_date: 2014-09-02 07:17:57

How do they deal with blocks growing in size? When blocks grow to a few gb every block... Transmitting that every 60 seconds? Wouldn't that centralize the coin more and cause a lot of problems or do I have the wrong idea?

Fist time I've seen someone tip in litecoin. cool.
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:42:04
I don't spend the funds I have on paper wallets. I see the coins I sent there as a black hole I can't and won't touch for many years. For spending I either buy through coinbase/circle and leave what I'm comfortable with on there, I then split some of the funds with some going to local wallet like breadwallet in case I can't access circle or coinbase. It depends how I'm feeling. I like to change it up a bit to get the feel of different wallets to know what to recommend to people. 
I have lost 0 coins so far and even if my web wallets were hacked I wouldn't lose much, I've only been around the community for a year so I don't know if that's saying much.

By the way if anyone else here is a student with an .edu email address you can get $100 free credit on digital ocean and can use that to run a node to contribute to the network for a few months.

Quick question. Now that you see the price this low. 
Will you 
1 sell 
2 hodl 
or 
3 ever buy more?
@_date: 2014-09-11 06:06:08
I'm surprised they didn't go with Canada second. They're probably after markets where it's not as easy to access bitcoin as it is in the U.S. and Canada.

Make a new electrum wallet. Write down the seed and keep it safe and then follow this: 
Go on the old bitcoin client and: click on help -&gt; click on debug window -&gt; click on Console...
Put the address you sent to as shown below:
dumpprivkey "the bitcoin address you sent to here"
The address being the money you sent to from where you bought your bitcoins.
Okay so now it will show you private key you can copy and paste into electrum.
Go back into Electrum -&gt; Click on Wallet toolbar -&gt; click on Private Keys -&gt; Click on import -&gt; paste private key from the bitcoin qt console.
Now in the send tab in electrum you can send from the address you just imported by right clicking the old address -&gt; send from -&gt; copy a newly generated address from electrum and send to that.. 
Now your seed will be able to recover those funds if your computer shuts down/breaks down from your new wallet's seed etc.
Sorry if it's too confusing and long. Not user friendly at all. :( Hope it helps, if not then I'll try to be more specific.

I'm down a bit too, but I'm still excited. It isn't just the price that excited and got me into bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-29 03:13:09
For electrum all you need to remember is the seed to recover your funds. It creates all the addresses from that. When you import the keys from your old wallet, the seed won't know about those keys if you used the seed again on a new computer or on a fresh install. What you could do is import your wallet, and send all of what you imported to an address created by electrum. (No, it won't prevent a transfer)
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:22:03
So you're not buying any more bitcoin ever again? :P
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:20:01
They used to be 70%. As of a few months ago they went down to less than 19% of the market as other exchanges started opening up and because of all the fuck ups Mt.Gox had. It's totally fine to be a noob, if you have any questions feel free to reply here or check out @_date: 2014-08-19 15:57:19

There's value in bitcoin. "Part of my thinking w/  as the first  app is to show how banning BTC == banning free-speach. -Peter Todd" Imagine? How powerful is that. There's a lot of value in this. There are many more apps that can also be built on top of bitcoin.

Nice! I'll be sure to stop by with a few friends after finals finish up. How are bitcoin sales? 
@_date: 2014-10-02 01:13:08
It's either circle that's getting hit with the fee on their end or you just haven't seen the fee appear yet. Maybe it will at the end of the month?

@_date: 2014-02-27 21:23:32
There are some ATMs like robocoin that allow you to convert back. You can also go online and covert it back to fiat and have it sent to your bank.Some give you a receipt of the private and public key on a piece of paper, but if anyone manages to take a picture of it they could steal your bitcoin. If you have any questions feel free to message or reply here.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:39:37
How? Next time do this. Get a wallet that requires no password but a phrase.. Breadwallet or electrum for example has you save and write down a phrase on a piece of paper or something. Even if you forget your pin or password you can still get it back with that phrase. What wallet were you using? If you can sorta remember your password or have any hints you can try this service: 
@_date: 2014-10-19 01:59:49
I don't think you can move those coins? The block after you can right? (need confirmation)

Get your priorities straight man. This is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:27:41
Yes true! Every four years (approximately) the reward gets cut in half. It used to be 50 bitcoin every ~ten minutes. What people do nowadays is they join a pool where a bunch of miners pool their hash power together to have a better chance at miniing a block. The 25btc reward then get's split across all the miners based on the work they did. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 03:20:29
Download mycelium and remember to back it up. Instructions are in the app! Then after you back up send coins and use it how you used doge! 500 bits @_date: 2014-02-20 17:52:38
Yeah, the site ran a deal that they gave away the hat if you bought anything on the site with bitcoin. They also don't convert the bitcoin to fiat.
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:24:20
Maybe, opening an exchange is hard here in the U.S.
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:27:57
How does it detract from the  bitcoin being useful? Sure sales went down, but there has been zero fraud, it costs them like almost nothing to accept it after the initial integration and they raised their projections on how many sales would be made through it. It's also still only available to people in the U.S. They may have adopted it early when there aren't as many users but that in no way means that there is no benefit in accepting it. It may be peanuts to them right now, but it's usefulness will become more apparent when they start accepting it internationally, unless of course they are banned from doing so.

No as they aren't forcing the currency down employees throats. It's an option. You can also have a percentage of your paycheck be paid in bitcoin. This is a step up as you have the freedom to pick either of the currencies you want to be paid in.

ah yeah, when you initiate a transaction it asks for a verification code. If you use authy for 2FA it also supports TouchID so that would work with it.

You haven't enabled 2FA????

@_date: 2014-11-20 03:12:24
I second this. The easiest way right now is through circle with a debit, credit card, or bank account. If you want something more feature rich try coinbase.com, except coinbase only lets you buy if you connect with a bank account.

@_date: 2014-09-24 21:11:46
Do we really want a frenzy? All it does is shoot the price up to unrealistic and unsustainable levels.. We then have new users get suckered in at buying at the top or near the top as they watch the price crash with them selling to never return.

The only thing that worries me is that they practically only use one address that I know of. Anyone would know what address you got Bitcoin at or sent from you looked at the address below and stood by one of their atms. Seems like it's getting a lot of activity. (It might only be one per atm, this one is the address I received Bitcoin from the ATM in Brea. (It's the same ATM and company)

Well it doesn't really affect me as I use the blockchain app? I also have the old coinbase app before they deleted it. It does suck for future updates and having other wallets. I would have went android if I knew about bitcoin when I got the phone.
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:26:39
Mining isn't something you should look into unless you have thousands to invest in a good mining rig. Even then you barely break even, and in the long run you'd probably make more just buying bitcoin itself instead. If your interested I would recommend looking into how mining works. (Ps: I don't mine) 
@_date: 2014-02-24 02:16:37
Do this. Spread your risk by buying on chunks. Spread it out to a few weeks.
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:57:24
I'm talking technically here. It can work. In the real world however most people would switch away if most of them were lost.

@_date: 2014-10-02 07:18:50
Millions of people would not shoot themselves in the foot. The banks would find someone else to handle it. The only thing I'd be worried about is if it were government mandated for all merchants etc to do this. But how would they enforce it? We'd all switch wallets?

Hold. I honestly think I'd lose more trying to sell and buy back at the right time.
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:02:34
What I recommend doing is just make an email specifically for coinbase or circle to buy your bitcoin. With 2fa of course. That way only circle or coinbase know your email.

If bitcoin were ever to skyrocket or at least have a gradual increase people will see that they will be able to buy less and less bits. I just introduced a friend to bitcoin and got her set up with breadwallet. She has bits in her mind and it sounded amazing to her when I sent her 2000 bits? Most people will never use millibits, the people that do would know how it works. As for it's already a computing term I don't see that that as a problem. It wasn't even mentioned as something that was confusing to me by my non-computer friends and family? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:27:32
Done! When I have spare bitcoin to spend, I'll be sure to check this place out. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 09:26:18
Another service? It's one product wouldn't be that hard to implement. Not sure if there would be much interest as it's also another growing cutting edge/tech. I wanted to see if there were any or to just give up in asking them. We have a  service accepting bitcoin, I see no reason why we a dna service would be that different. (Although you only buy a test once, hmm) 
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:36:44
Complete control of my money? Not run by any government? No manipulation in the total supply of it? I can buy stuff online anywhere in the world? I don't need a bank to obtain bitcoin? What are you talking about. Just no: 
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:33:17
That's only because floating fees haven't been implemented yet.

I agree, I doubt they'd be able to scale that fast in a few days or weeks. They'd probably have to ditch the free plan.

I hate to have to ask for feature requests like this... Can you add an option to hide the current balance or at least hide it in the receive money view? 
@_date: 2014-10-06 06:50:01
The problem with that reasoning is Satoshi could have kept moving coins around to keep them sorta-"fresh" and mixed them. Aren't these coins mixed!?
@_date: 2014-10-02 06:56:42
If they did, people would fork it and we'd all move toward the one with the 21 million limit intact.

Spread bitcoin to people who don't have any. It's so damn easy getting bitcoin to people who have never made a wallet or account. The big hurdle is having people not think changetip is a scam trying to phish their account.

Bitcoin won't be worth shit in a few years if no one uses it.
@_date: 2015-05-25 06:46:41
Do you value your files? If not reinstall fresh. If you do sign up at a brokerage like circle.com and instant buy .1 bitcoin and send it so it decrypts. I'm not familiar with this program or if it even decrypts if you pay but it's worth a shot at ~24 bucks there's no other way unless the keys to this program have been released some other way. Sorry dude, this must really suck. :( edit: Check Aussiehash's comment to see if there is indeed a way to decrypt it before sending them any bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-24 01:58:58
I'm sad that they're not as good as they were in closed beta. :/ I haven't had any problems, well other than one instant purchase taking a few hours to be credited to my account, but sucks for newbies. (was during the run up to 450+) I really wanted to be able to tell friends about circle, but I won't until they fix most of the problems they're having with new users.

Just link your routing number and you can buy on coinbase. There's a lame 5 day delay due to how slow ACHs are. You can hook up your credit card for verification to instant buy though. (They still charge your bank, cc is there as a back up)

Downloading: First thoughts. It looks very pretty. Any way you can have the option to have different units? mBTC bits etc? It's sorta annoying that when you get to the pin screen it doesn't automatically bring up the keyboard to enter it. Although, I'm not much of an altcoin person anymore having it all in one wallet seems cool. I only see Litecoin right now.The waggle feature is pretty cool too. :-)
I hope touch id gets implemented too when iOS comes out!

There is no need for the store to have to accept the volatility and risk involved. For 1% they can just convert it to fiat and have it still be cheaper than credit cards? In this case it wouldn't even matter if Bitcoin went to zero.

Got to be more specific on how they are the same. Coinbase is superior in utility as it's had more time to integrate features. Circle is easier to buy and sell. There are also more ways to add money on Circle than there is on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 05:02:25
Bitcoin is risky, I wouldn't recommend putting money you can't afford to lose in it. There are services(exchanges or brokerages) that are not shady which include coinbase.com. They are trustworthy from my experience and are stationed in California. (You can only buy through coinbase if you live in the U.S.) As for the benefits there are lower fees when buying things online, as a merchant there is no charge back risk after a confirmation, only 21 million will ever be created and you can't just "make" more after that(they're divisible, though), bitcoin can't be shutdown and is borderless etc. Negatives are that unless you're tech savvy there's the risk that your bitcoins may be stolen if you don't secure them right, volatility in price, and if you have an iphone there are no bitcoin wallet apps on the app store (they're banned) etc.
@_date: 2015-05-18 13:54:27
Yes but how do you know the address passed on to the trezor isn't compromised either? You only find out after the fact. It's better than losing everything like you would if everything was on a usb drive or computer, but still.

There is nothing wrong with marketing that works? Many people may not have liked it, but it did get a lot of people hyped up about it. I'm honestly worried how they'll handle all the credit card charge backs which is why I don't keep any bitcoin on circle.

@_date: 2014-11-05 03:58:36
You can't compare 1 doge confirmation to 1 bitcoin confirmation. Security wise 1 bitcoin confirmation is magnitudes more secure than 1 doge confirmation. You need a couple doge confirmations to even compare.

The wallet needs an unlock via pin or Touch ID so you can see the balance. It's simple as done that way so you don't need a pin to quickly receive funds, you can just open the app and bam show a qr code or copy and address and you're good. Why would anyone dare imputing addresses manually? It's a wallet I get noobs and friends to download it and they like the simplicity.

Better spent elsewhere too. I'm agreeing with you. But don't point at one or two narrow projects and expect two different communities to fund them the same even if they're both currencies. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 17:02:16
The developer said this version was a quick one. He knows it is slow and just wanted to see if apple would allow it before putting more work into making a native wallet app. Decrypting takes ain't time even on my 5S, but eventually it does decrypt it.
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:32:15
I'd hope so!

Cept he sent it via a Coinbase account to a Coinbase account. So yes it can be seized.

NFC would be the best way if everyone phone had it. I'd even say way easier, but currently QR code is the best due to it being the most available to everyone.

A good place to buy is from coinbase.com or circle.com. They're also wallets, but make sure you have 2fa enabled so you don't get your bitcoin stolen. I'd recommend moving your bitcoin off the web wallets once you've gotten familiar with all the different local wallets etc. A good desktop one is electrum.
@_date: 2014-07-03 23:57:35
with bitcoin pls.
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:07:27
I see this as good news. It's a gateway coin, that'll hopefully gain traction to introduce more people to Bitcoin. A lot of people like me got into Bitcoin through alt coins like dogecoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 17:41:53
Fees to use internationally?
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:56:00
Well they're dumping coins either way. I don't think it's bad in the long term. I see it as temporary dumping until their suppliers start accepting them or employees want to be paid in btc. Unless of course they're keeping a percentage of it?
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:45:26

Segwit does allow for there to be bigger blocks mined?

@_date: 2017-02-08 08:57:54
The only controversy with segwit is because of politics...

@_date: 2014-11-12 02:17:28
For profit? I don't see that happening until increases in hashing efficiency start slowing down. I wouldn't see much of a profit in mining in space when you have to replace them every few months. I think you mean nodes. :)

Blockchain app on cydia.

How do you know when they're not at the level of adoption bitcoin is at?
@_date: 2017-02-08 09:16:48
The facts are a couple of chinese pools are against segwit or not willing to support when almost everyone else is except for a minority over in that also spout crazy ideas like blockstream supporting censorship or trying to take over bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:35:58
Yeah. You don't need to own a whole bitcoin to use it. There are different units that make equal up to one bitcoin. For example: 1 million bits = 1 bitcoin. Here's 500 bits :)
@_date: 2015-05-18 04:49:24
The problem with that too is how does a trezor prevent someone from changing the address shown on your computer screen so that you sent money to the hackers address?
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:01:41
6000? I never got 6000 for connecting to Facebook?

I'm more worried about a government or rogue employee going in and stealing money from their cold storage wallets.
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:26:30
Yes a huge need. We need a friendly simple bitcoin app on the cydia store. Blockchain is good, but it is old and not visual appealing at all. I'd love for there to be a newer open source bitcoin wallet on the cydia store so I can jailbreak my friend's iphones and install the wallet for them. Android is proof of this. Their wallets are amazing.

It's the whole stack, which means an integrated "framework" for hardware wallets for all devices with this chip. That's huge, especially for the ones embedded in phones. edit: clarified
@_date: 2014-09-11 18:47:40
And for volume to increase we need easier ways for normal people to buy bitcoin instantly. Waiting days to get it sucks and really throws off a lot people I introduce bitcoin to. (I know this is the banks fault) Buying off an exchange is not user friendly. I am glad coinbase is going international for more people to be able to buy easier.

 I disagree with your teacher, he's just misinformed. That doesn't make him an idiot overall, but he's no expert with Bitcoin just because he's a professor at an Ivy League. Heck MIT is funding Bitcoin development, look at what they've been up to crypto related. Financially, Bitcoin is risky. You can lose your money if the market crashes, but that's just market price wise which your professor may equate to a ponzi. Tech wise on the code level, Bitcoin is not a ponzi.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:55:35
I recommend just buying a few dollars worth off coinbase or circle. You'll never get anything significant amount of bitcoin from watching videos.

@_date: 2017-02-08 08:59:31
You keep spamming here. Most wallets want segwit. Most HW wallet want segwit. Most companies want segwit.. Most nodes RUN segwit ready nodes. How much more support do you want?

And you know from experience? You don't even understand bitcoin. You think miners can just change consensus rules to their liking. If you want bitcoin to become that, just go use PayPal or banks. They or the governments decide the rules.
@_date: 2015-05-05 02:04:15
Even less I'd assume. This is the volume from  a collection of exchanges in Brazil, not one.

Doesn't seem too outrageous. I signed up like 5 family members and even got the referral reward. Luckily they all bought low $900s and some want to continue averaging out buys. I also invited a ton of classmates and they too are buying.

@_date: 2015-05-22 07:18:13
The problem is. These devices don't mine? They don't all have full nodes. They hash and point that hashing power toward a centralized pool? Hopefully some of these kinks get worked out to preserve decentralization.

I'd see why Oculus would want or consider putting a chip into the Oculus Rift. Virtual Reality with a digital currency integrated right into the hardware. Being able to natively be able to send and receive money in a digital world is huge. As well as having all Rift's be able to talk to other hardware with the same chip. As well as micropayments for in game items, etc.
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:37:25

No. When you remember a mnemonic for a bitcoin wallet. Only you yourself have control over the value displayed on a bitcoin address. You can remember your cc info, but in the end you don't have complete control over it, the cc companies or banks do.
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:29:33
Other than not being able to get verified after repeatedly contacting support. They need to add more verification methods or update it. I'd say their ease of use is the most positive. Instant buy is a huge plus when you add your credit card to coinbase.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:19:32
What freedoms do you have when you can't even send a transaction due to blocks being filled up? Presumably the more users that want this financial freedom the less everyone will have due to the block size limit at 1MB. I'm not saying increase it exponentially, but in one years time 1MB will be nothing even for the most conservative uses.
@_date: 2014-10-04 04:41:05
Most of us are thinking that.... What are you reading that's not that?

You do realize he gives you a prompt to be aware of these risks when you're jailbroken and to use it with the latest version of iOS which aren't publicly jailbroken yet. He never claimed your Bitcoin would be safe if your phone is jailbroken. Obviously, it's the same with android bitcoin wallets. He actively goes against using breadwallet on jailbroken phones.
@_date: 2017-02-12 03:27:57

@_date: 2017-02-26 09:09:30
Yes, maybe if an attacker maliciously mines an invalid block to segwit nodes. Miners are more on top of what happens network wise, so I'm sure they prepare even if it means preparing without upgrading to segwit.

It seems odd too since Alexis seemed to be interested and even invested in a bitcoin exchange a while back. Maybe the other execs? Notes seemed cool, but a disaster to document everyone's info to be able to issue them..

4.7k volume right now, I don't see anywhere outside of the exchange where you can see that. hmm

Didn't know he also invested in coinbase. Cool.
@_date: 2017-02-26 01:03:56
In this scheme, users and miners are truly opt-in to a softfork.
Basically miners for segwit opt-in to process them, non-segwit miners can behave like normal and would only mine an invalid block in the case that they intentionally mine something not valid under the 'user' deployed softfork.
This also incentivizes miners to upgrade if they see users actually using segwit as they wouldn't have a chance at any of the transaction fees for those using segwit.

So? Selling out that many coins is good in the long run. You can only sell once.
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:56:54
Okay, but will you dump?

That's exactly the first thing that came up on my mind when I read about this.

Try switching over to a native wallet. Try bread wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:17:11
If it were in 2009 or even 2010 that computer probably would have mined thousands of coins oh man.

If this applies to regular transactions then why wouldn't they apply them to bitcoin?

Is there anyway to have this implemented so you don't need to log in via a computer to do a transaction for those that need subscription support. Say there's a qr code you can scan with coinbase's mobile wallet so I don't need to log in? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:15:58
RemindMe! 1 month "Bitcoin over $600?"

Note that other softforks  pre CSV actually forced you to update or be orphaned off. This one or even just regular SF segwit doesn't.

There's a coinbase app on iOS too. You can download that and copy an address from breadwallet and paste it into the coinbase app to send to it. Oh and I hope you wrote down the phrase and kept it somewhere safe.

Apple has closed down nfc for their own use like they did with touchid for a year. They couldn't even if they wanted to, but probably will once Apple opens it up to devs.

It has it too?
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:51:33
Well to be fair it did seem like they teamed up until it came out that paybase is just doing this through gyft's api. He probably should have reached out to gyft before tweeting that, though. (probably wanted to break the news first)
@_date: 2015-01-31 05:30:44
What was the issue in the end?
@_date: 2015-01-01 16:56:45
I hate that people still say this.. How do you expect merchants to accept it if they have to face the volatility risk? On the flipside how do you expect the volatility risk to go down if bitcoin stays as a speculative investment instead of actually being used with merchants safely?
Merchants converting to fiat is not in any way bad.... It's a stopgap until more and more merchants start accepting it until one day the volatility risk is low enough that they one day decide to start holding a percentage and spend them with other merchants or suppliers. You can't get to that level of adoption expecting everyone not to convert.
@_date: 2017-02-02 09:59:09
She is pro trump.
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:59:37


I only said that because you said you already have bought through coinbase. I assumed you were already verified on coinbase or was that not the case? If so that's why I said contact support. (I used to have issues being verified in the beginning of 2014 and it took months for it to finally work)
@_date: 2015-01-25 08:22:03
Going all in aren't you? haha. Check this site out  It lists exchanges that are in Israel or support buying from it. I'm not well versed on the best exchanges in Israel, but you could try  or  ?

Overvalued? I'd be more inclined to say bitcoin is undervalued,but  I don't  know anymore 
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:01:32
It doesn't.  Just make sure to not deposit bitcoin there through any old deposit addresses you used before. Not an issue related with wiring money there.
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:45:37
Hope to god it isn't litecoin
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:51:49
That's correct. It also helps combine a lot of inputs cheaply. Coinjoin will be fun and incentivized!!

Right when my dad is getting less hostile about bitcoin he hears on the radio that bitcoin is one of the currencies worse off in price when compared the the ruble. :l
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:50:41
I thought this too. Would be pretty cool but not hype worthy
@_date: 2017-02-22 03:28:07
If you sent to yourself it's always okay to send again even when unconfirmed.

Waiting for the encore of people quoting Gates saying, "Bitcoin alone is not good enough" I disagree of course as the type of functionality he wants can be built on top of bitcoin except for his concerns on volatility.

Legally yes as they are property

You can tell there are a lot of bots favoriting and retweeting the things Josh and his followers say.
@_date: 2017-02-25 10:52:02
Because they're stupid. It's only okay if BU devs have 'checked' it!
I recently raised the question of adding fuel to their stupid as fuck conspiracy theories "saying what if Blockstream backdoored bitcoin and you're still merging in changes from them."
The response I got were along the lines of: "It's not an issue, or devs checked it to make sure"
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:19:40
Sweet, I'm on the same boat. I actually bought some coins off my family member as he caved short term with the promise that I'd pay him back at the price he paid for them *if* it ever hits it again. (I didn't push for him to buy them but I felt bad that I indirectly helped him lose money) Then again, I did tell him not to buy that much as well as the risks involved including a scenario like this. Meh, more coins for me. I'm long for a few years at least. Cold storage ftw.
@_date: 2015-01-28 08:45:01
No. lol It's $1 by the way and you're not supposed to post referral links
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:34:50
Honestly it's been the opposite for me. I've been buying from circle since I got my invite just right before it opened up. I've always received my coins instantly even when I constantly bought up to the instant limit. With coinbase, I still can't get level 2 verified and was stuck with the dumb $100 a week instant limit. I've been buying from coinbase on a weekly basis since December before I moved to circle. You'd think I'd be able to get verified after that? Nope. Waiting for it to clear sucked way too much to stay. edit: I'm in heaven. Just tried to get verified and actually got questions. Amazing. Finally after months of trying I'm level 2 verified. Instant limit at 1k makes me happy. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:52:15
Meh, I only bought $30 bucks(at that time in bitcoin) worth of ether. Nothing much to fret over, but glad that I'll be included in the genesis block if it does indeed take off. :)

@_date: 2015-01-26 18:13:25
You could dip your toes in and buy a small amount. Bitcoin is still crazy volatile. This can devalue just as fast as it came up! Very risky, but I believe in the tech. Coinbase sure is legitmate and I wouldn't go wrong signing up with them. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 23:10:02
Especially if different companies emerge doing the same thing in different parts of the world.

That's not how it works at all. Previous luck has no impact on future luck:

I copied a guide: 
Basically, your breadwallet has a bitcoin address. You can get this by swiping left on the screen. The new screen will read "receive money" and below, in blue text, will be your bitcoin address.
Touch this and it will list 3 options:
copy to clipboard
send as email
send as message
Send it to your own email or however you want. This address is your universally unique public address. The entire world can send u money with this address.
In coinbase, withdraw your BTC to that address and you will receive btc there.
@_date: 2014-07-04 00:59:49

Isn't that a bit ridiculous? Maybe if they accepted Bitcoin directly, but they don't. If bitpay or Coinbase the ones processing their transaction support it then it's a done deal.

Either way it's going to become the 2nd train whether you like it or not and at that point bitcoin will become unusable with there being a backlog of transactions for days if kept at 1MB. People will look elsewhere and use alternatives and bitcoin will once again be seen as a joke.
"What freedoms do you have when you can't even send a transaction due to blocks being filled up? Presumably the more users that want this financial freedom the less everyone will have due to the block size limit at 1MB.(Even if you pay fees) I'm not saying increase it exponentially, but in one years time 1MB will be nothing even for the most conservative of users."

Right now buy through coinbase. I also live in  LA area and it's the easiest cheapest way so far. There's also circle, but that's invite only at the moment.

It's trivial to include hundreds of transactions easily.. I alone have put in a ton of junk the past day alone.  I honestly was surprised miners mined my trash? Fees weren't exactly big either.If I alone can do that I don't really think it takes much to make a block look full. lol

The first time it was announced?
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:05:15
It isn't a completely new implementation. It's literally based off core with code to upgrade to 2MB if the majority hashrate agrees.
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:31:36
And it wouldn't make a difference at 750kb....... It'd be the same exact shit. We weren't always mining full blocks until recently and many didn't run nodes then. So no, respectfully I disagree. I'm saying this as someone running a core full node.

Well, I wouldn't say this is set in stone or supported by any core devs that I know of yet. BIP-102 was also a HF. This is a bit different as you don't need complete or close to full consensus to deploy a softfork. Mostly just an idea.

Blockchain.info is full of bugs. Try checking other explorers.
@_date: 2017-02-26 07:50:24
Hmm, but it's necessary in a HF only to avoid  unintentional chainsplits. That really isn't a problem with segwit SF as legacy miners can continue to mine as they do now without issue. They'd have to purposely want chain split and mine invalid segwit transactions to fork off. They have a say in opting out and not mining segwit transactions.

What? Just asking if you're leaving bitcoin for good or if you'd ever consider buying a small part &amp;lt;100 back.(not as an investment, but to use) I was just curious. ._.

You can export keys: 
I'd use another wallet like electrum. You can bump the fee if you set transactions to be replaceable. I'd export it if it doesn't confirm.

@_date: 2017-03-01 22:53:25
Bitcoin fundamentally on a base layer does not do 'instant' transactions in any form. Just because you magically wished it did does not make it so. We can however, achieve many of these things trustless offchain....

@_date: 2017-03-08 02:51:22
I'm not sure I agree with this. You CSV your coins and then if there's a HF how will you be able to sell your coins on the side of the fork you disagree with?
@_date: 2016-06-16 06:21:33
There's one in Brea Mall in California that I've used. You could try asking the operator how the experience was?
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:16:11

@_date: 2016-06-15 20:31:44
So... How to pay more of a fee. Wait there's no wallet I'd recommend to anybody that does that.... Cheapskate? I don't mind if fees go up but most regular users do no know they're being "cheap," they just expect the tx to confirm.

He's been brainwashed by the r/btc crowd to think core censors.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:19:17
He's wrong. I always exclusively buy from circle as it's a dollar or a bit less cheaper than buying would with coinbase. I compare the two. (Only in certain cases was circle higher in price, I think at some parts during this run up it was)
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:51:10
Well classic is that. No rules are changed until there is a supermajority? I don't understand your reasoning.
@_date: 2016-06-06 02:14:42
For buying circle or coinbase are good. For local wallets under your control there are breadwallet, copay, mycelium. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:24:20
Thanks Pieter, and all those that contributed. Looks great!
@_date: 2016-06-08 19:29:43
They don't, but short term bumps to increase block size to safe levels isn't so crazy. I prefer core over classic, but man why doesn't it make sense to program in a block size increase so early in the game that can be deployed a year out instead of all the infighting. Core is doing great things in many other areas, but over optimizing early on drives away growth. Although overall I'm glad it's hard to make changes to bitcoin, it should be like that. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 16:47:32
What price did you buy at? If it makes you this uncomfortable a small drop like this then I think you should sell. I used to be in your position and would freak out every drop. Not so much anymore but man it was tough at first!

@_date: 2016-06-15 16:35:26
Do you personally think it's not safe enough to raise it a few MBs? I would have rather had a staged HF over a few months to a year to avoid the severity of this... And we're seeing the flood of confused users wondering why "bitcoin isn't working?"

@_date: 2016-06-05 04:32:23
Well I take back what I said, but we both were technically right. And I really really doubt most bitcoin users are buying/selling 100 bitcoin at a time.
"they manipulate their payout curves to favor small numbers for comparison's sake, when most users probably fall into higher tiers."
Or you know a brokerage is for those that want convenience and smaller amounts and actual exchanges are for higher volume? If most users really are buying at 100 btc blocks which I REALLY doubt, then they're idiots for using circle or coinbase. You can't even buy that much on circle due to limits???? It says so yourself that the limit is 3k so I don't know why you're using 100 btc and that being what most users fall in.. Contradicting. Circle is for smaller amounts mostly, not for 100 btc plus at a time customers??????????????? That and my limit is also 3k and I've been a user with the from the start.
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:29:41
Wait? I'm in California and Coinbase/gdax works just fine? There's always circle too
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:52:17

@_date: 2016-06-02 05:51:44
Try using electrum for big amounts with a good password and storing the phrase down on paper. For a good mobile wallet if you're on iOS breadwallet is pretty good.
@_date: 2016-06-02 03:09:01
Not at this current state. You still need to rebalance channels/settle at some point with layer 2. If you have millions of users or even millions/billions of machine &lt;-&gt; machine payments, you're going a bigger block size. What will that be? Who knows, but making it smaller will only make it worse. I'm fine with modest increases with miners soft capping it to a level that's currently safe.
@_date: 2016-06-11 04:23:46
Sure, but who would carry that much money on a mobile wallet outside of their house? Most have two wallets. Cold storage for big amounts.. Local wallet with a bit more, and one on mobile for outside use.. I don't carry thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin as I wouldn't with cash, that'd be crazy!.. Credit will still be something big even with bitcoin becoming more popular... bitcoin is more akin cash in what you'd carry.

@_date: 2016-06-05 04:16:05
Nope. If you have that much to buy, honestly most would use an exchange for that type of money. (I wish I was in that group)
If you bring those values back down to earth, you can see circle beating out coinbase on the buy side. Sell side too, unless there's a rate that changes after that. (I don't like keeping much on exchanges)
This is at amounts I can buy at a time... or most people.

Hook up your credit card. It wont' charge it and it'll give you instant for purchases with your bank, unless they change that? I still get instant using my bank account.
@_date: 2017-03-06 06:51:39
Sorry to burst your bubble, but you can do partial address searches on smartbit.com.au. Those addresses have had a lot of bitcoin through them... lol
@_date: 2017-01-04 04:48:14
Those are all valid points. I'd say it's more of a special case sending 6 in a row. How often does that happen for most people? For most people the convenience of one backup beats any loss of anonymity. Note I am not saying you shouldn't also make backups with metadata, just that many users may prefer to have a backup of the seed initially while making backups of their metadata with the seed in a different medium.  Metadata is important sure, but I still think supporting a seed without having to have to backup the wallet.dat is important too, and I'm sure most real users would agree?
@_date: 2017-01-19 07:28:17
Privacy reasons? There are plenty of reasons.
@_date: 2017-01-07 01:10:51
You have to wait for ACH to clear. That takes AGES. They said it's their bank they have to work with to get 'instant' ACH with limits... I hope that happens soon. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 23:54:28
No problem. Happy to help!
@_date: 2016-06-12 22:08:22
Sign up on an exchange.. coinbase exchange? Bitfinex. You could try signing up on circle too.
@_date: 2016-06-13 00:33:20
At this price range? Be careful!I think coinbase has a CAD exchange. Very low volume, but you could try setting a buy order and have it eaten up.
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:23:56
Most mobile wallets use this as well as the latest version of bitcoin core.
@_date: 2016-06-11 17:56:45
Yes, I have a 21 bitcoin computer and I bought a sensor and hooked it up.. 21 has an aggregator for all the cities it has people who are running these sensors too! When you pay me 20 satoshis through 21, or if you really like my endpoint through a payment channel you'll get a reply with the temperature and pressure readings from my sensor. 
Here's more information if you're interested:
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:19:24
I might stop by on my travels to check it out.. :P
@_date: 2017-01-26 05:37:33
My friend is a bit technical, so she can get the feel of using an exchange. I'll also send her this so if there are more people interested they can go this route!
@_date: 2016-06-05 01:24:49
I agree. If you're serious and want something safe and can afford a trezor go that route. Just make sure you back up your phrase in the case the trezor's hardware goes kapoot. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 20:24:58
He seemed to not understand bitcoin. He wanted to skype and I was sketched out so I avoided it.
@_date: 2016-06-11 03:30:13
You could enforce volume based limits with multisig. I think bitgo does this.
@_date: 2016-06-12 05:09:23
Gox had tons of technical problems! Just don't keep much on there yo.
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:56:43
Proof of residence such as a utility bill, and form of identification: Scanned Driver's license or SS.
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:33:33
Exactly. How can I recommend bitcoin to anyone? I can use it as a techy, but anyone else? uh...
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:50:55
Hey may just be referencing the seed as a brain wallet. Glad you made the distinction for others to see. I personally think having a seed with a strong passphrase stored physically and on another location is secure, while also memorizing the unencrypted seed in your head being the (brainwallet) so to speak.
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:28:25
Bitcoin's open source :p
@_date: 2017-01-31 07:40:49
Just use electrum. It's great with my nano s. I love it!
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:43:06
Ethereum people did just that.. Then they started spamming users posting here with direct messages. I agree unacceptable behavior.
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:49:09
I do. I set them myself. I'm talking about all those users stuck on wallets that aren't on the same boat, or aren't informed...
@_date: 2016-06-13 04:26:00
The old way was bad for privacy. You also should never reuse an address. It's not safe future wise. While you wouldn't lose funds now you could potentially in the future. All you gotta know from xpubs is that you can generate addresses from it. You can also still send to past addresses in your wallet, but that's not really recommended. It'll still show up in your wallet.
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:40:32
You're using a wallet with a static fee. What wallet are you using?
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:36:22
I guess, not so bad. Perhaps up the price to save $4? hahaI just think it's absurdly small buy, when you literally lose 1 weekly due to extra fees a year.  :-)
@_date: 2016-06-12 19:24:35
A lot of other things happening in the news right now. Also, it hasn't really hit an ATH yet.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:46:23
If you have an old computer laying around, download electrum and never connect it to the internet and you can use that as cold storage after saving the seed.
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:03:43
You don't like the pope? Aren't you Catholic? Explain! (Not attacking, just confused)
@_date: 2017-01-28 02:23:10
Yes, you can. Along with other alts.
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:24:08
Yes, Circle had same fee for bank and debit cards.
@_date: 2017-01-02 02:23:13
You're always welcome back. :-)
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:42:57
Yes, originally.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:19:21
What PoS system did they use?
@_date: 2016-06-19 12:41:33
Got cleared with the lawyers. :-)
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:57:10
See, and this problem is even made so many magnitudes worse when blocks are so small. Blocks are full as it is. Everyone fees are going up. There's a point where you can't just expect to be confirmed in the next few blocks as it would be an arms race to see who paid the most fees. I think all wallets should be doing fee estimation, but it so stupid to think that that's the real problem. The more legitimate transactions in a block, the easier it is for an attacker to spam tx's to cut off a lot of real users transactions... UX is really broken, and we're seeing it in play right now.
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:14:33
What is with this shitpost?
@_date: 2017-01-13 01:12:14
Malware probably. Avoid like the plague.
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:46:56
Many miners want to increase the blocksize is they think the fees at this point in time are excessive....
@_date: 2017-01-01 05:25:10
Yes, only if it's a 0.13 generated wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-31 05:37:51
Gonna shill my own bot. Here's an accurate countdown with current bip9 stats. They didn't use bip9 before so all that is probably segwit. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:52:27
Same... 3 years, no issues here. Gemini, Coinbase, Circle.. even buttercoin back in the day. No issues.
@_date: 2017-01-15 20:04:16
Provide a service or contract to countries that would pay you in bitcoin from outside of Turkey. You can then sell at a premium and give others access to bitcoin too.
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:20:46
No lightning network devs want flexible transactions. They all prefer segwit. They alllll are building on segwit not FT. Try again.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:57:09
Multiple individuals from coinbase support segwit. The CEO, Charlie Lee.
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:51:31
Sure there is. Soft-Hard Fork. :P
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:33:10
It wasn't intentional. :/
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:37:40
Many reasons. It works. It's been tested to death. It can be deployed in less than a month if miners fucken start mining it. They've been using it for months in their implementation. FT isn't even close.
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:45:42
While hilarious for us, I think that's genuinely what he believes it should be. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:56:28
You're on the wrong sub mate.
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:21:24
You're just asking for a temp ban, with all these new shit posts? 
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:18:50
It does. Hopefully we can all come together and get what's best for bitcoin passed to gain more capacity.
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:18:12
Rbtc is leaking again.
@_date: 2017-01-20 01:06:02
Works fine here.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:58:00
Yes, but even maximalists like me are getting worried this affects real users and companies. I want segwit now.. Miners are being stubborn. At the same time I want at least a bump up to something safe? What is that? 10 MB? I want anything but 1 MB. That's absurdly small.
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:45:59
Cool I've used bitcoin in multiple countries and it's always been a different experience. :-)
@_date: 2017-01-19 20:06:00
You should really verify your claims professor. I don't see any sources or proof on your end?
@_date: 2017-01-23 21:11:59
And the rise of fake Japanese volume.
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:58:20
Ah shoot. If 31.xxx mbtc it's .031 btc
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:37:00
No, that's 31.483 btc.
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:19:13
Don't. This kind of thing isn't condoned.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:00:31
$5? You should batch those in bigger amounts. Fees are probably killing you.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:03:58
If you don't want to buy it at a premium or wait, what are you complaining about? There are other wallets. Just go buy another one? Ledger nano s, keepkey? 
@_date: 2017-01-01 05:04:50
Latest version of core uses an HD wallet.
@_date: 2016-06-06 05:20:27
First I need to know what kind of ATM? Take a picture.
@_date: 2017-01-04 04:53:34
I personally wouldn't support a coercive soft fork. At most, I'd think it'd be safe to lower the locked in % to 75%. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 07:35:39
You forgot the /s
@_date: 2017-01-31 06:38:27
Who the hell told you to buy so much so high? I always tell everyone, never one shot bitcoin purchase especially when it's going up.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:33:03
I'm talking capacity wise, it just leads to so much infighting. I understand how it affects everything else and how fast it can blow up and be vulnerable to attack. You also missed how bigger blocks can affect miner incentives in a really bad way. Core is great. I synced up litecoin the other day and it only took a few hours due to all the work core has done. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 08:46:48
Having endured rbtc.. I'm conditioned to think people are serious and really that stupid.
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:17:35
When did you create the wallet? If you created it with 0.13, it'll be an HD wallet and you only need to backup once, if not you should move all money to an HD wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:59:58
Do we really need global consensus for $3? Anything lower than $10 should be off chain with LN settled on chain at a later point. But I do feel for everyone. 1 MB is damn small and I'm a bitcoin maximalist who thinks the core team is great. If only segwit were activated already. :(
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:20:02
No thx, segwit SF, then planned safe HF
@_date: 2016-06-08 21:45:32
Bundle it in with delayed rollout on what can gain consensus.
@_date: 2017-01-01 01:26:27
Did you start off with that same one? If so, you have an HD wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:53:25
It can always be tweaked higher. I'm sure many would agree there.
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:46:24
I've had people telling me I'm crazy for years. Jokes on them.
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:35:43
Set opt-in rbf and bump it if it doesn't confirm in time.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:40:42
What do I want? I want blocksize to be as big as it can be. The reality is there are security tradeoffs with doing just that. You can't just pretend it'll be fine and dandy if you do it. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 06:50:43
Yep. Merchants or those that need to be instant would presumably be online. If not then waiting is not such a huge issue.
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:44:33
I don't see anything wrong with a fee market. It needs to be done, but at 1MB come on? You're more likely to confuse and drive away users.
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:42:26
Brigading any sub is against the rules.
@_date: 2016-06-11 04:12:13
What you have as your limit yes, but so is having a gun and taking you to an ATM and asking your to make a large withdrawal.
@_date: 2016-06-05 05:32:17
They don't charge your credit card. You know that right? I think you mean debit. That's 3% for coinbase. Credit card is there for instant in the situation that the ACH fails. They also don't charge an extra fee for bank + cc for fraud related reasons for instant buy.
@_date: 2017-01-04 03:01:20
For most users, and not businesses... They care about the money, and not metadata...
@_date: 2016-11-27 21:55:13
Seems a bit early for that at the moment.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:24:37
There's always risk when you're connected to the internet. I recommend creating a wallet with your main stash. Backup the 12 recovery words, and then create a new wallet and have your spending funds on that and also save those 12 recovery words.
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:30:59
It is preferred. They want segwit.
@_date: 2016-12-29 08:52:58
Yep.... They switched real fast to saying price would be x Times higher instead of saying it'd crash and die.
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:45:03
What version are you using?
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:28:11
You could always download electrum, send your money to the addresses there on an offline computer. Save the phrase with a passs offline, and delete the wallet from you computer.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:01:45
If there's one thing I know is don't fuck with the bitcoin community. We're vicious.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:04:20


What a horrible name.
@_date: 2016-11-19 18:27:19
I should explain. No chance of activation in current epoch as more than 100 blocks signaled blocks that weren't segwit. We have to wait until the next difficulty retarget and at that point I output something else based on the chances it'll lock in. I can change that if it's too confusing?
@_date: 2016-11-20 01:04:22
Not worth giving our bitcoin away... I'd rather get rid of my fiat. ;-)
@_date: 2016-12-11 00:15:49
You're making wild claims and such stupid remarks it probably should be removed. You want to spew this crap? Go to rbtc
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:36:35
Poor guy, it was unrelated to the hat, though...
@_date: 2016-11-20 00:27:41
I bid $5.
@_date: 2016-11-06 01:10:13
It isn't really that comparable imo.
@_date: 2016-12-07 07:59:34
You can try Gemini. Instant buy with ACH deposit. You can't withdraw until it's cleared though.
@_date: 2016-06-06 19:56:04
Happy cake day!
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:02:33
At this point it could literally just be users outbidding users with spam attacks to make it worse. Wallet dynamic fees does not fix the first problem...
@_date: 2016-11-28 01:04:33
Do you think you'll ever be able to sell physical bitcoins to U.S. customers?
@_date: 2016-11-03 17:26:10
Same but in 2011, and I didn't mine any. Haha
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:25:07
Message support. If you still have issues try another brokerage like circle.
@_date: 2016-11-05 07:56:28
That is not the case.....
@_date: 2016-12-08 23:38:18
You can actually still send to a bitcoin address as long as you haven't converted to a dollar account. Tap on send, tap in the amount, and on the next screen it lets you put in a bitcoin address to scan a qr code. It sucks that they didn't make this clear or removed the qr code from the main screen. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 08:48:11
@_date: 2016-12-14 03:08:19
At the rate it's going. 40%+ is amazing. This is why it's good to take your time with softforks so nodes can update. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:52:14
Works here. iOS

This is bittersweet. 17RH5qaHCKPrEFtThtK5Pqu4NECN3bZsjK
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:36:28
This just complicates things further. I've never reallly sold at all so I figured taxes wouldn't be an issue unless I sold. I've made a ton of transactions moving money between circle &lt;-&gt; coinbase to consolidate funds that I wouldn't have done if I knew it were a taxable event...
@_date: 2016-12-03 02:48:48
If we just scale to an endless blocksize no one will be able to verify. The solution is finding a balance between the two, but it's been so politicized. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:00:07
Transfer your friends to other apps and delete circle. That's what I'm doing to 10+ friends.
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:17:53
Knock some sense into them.
@_date: 2017-01-21 02:18:51
I had the same question, they're offering you loans. Maybe ask for a way to offer ACH without instant?
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:18:25
For the newbies they need more clarification on secure and maintained OS. :P
@_date: 2016-12-12 00:08:37
Yep, a brain wallet is powerful. It's only dangerous when you primarily store a seed of 12 or 24 words in your head and not encrypted with backups elsewhere. I don't think anyone is advocating that as safe. :-)
@_date: 2016-12-10 15:18:43
Not understanding bitcoin and releasing not well thought out code leads to people losing money. It's serious.
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:33:18
Depends how much you have. If you have a considerable amount and holding long term I would recommend buying a hardware wallet. If it isn't that much and you want to be able to sell quickly I hope you have 2FA on your email, and on coinbase. Not text 2FA either, but google auth style 2FA.
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:27:12
I hope you think BU is even less of a minority and barely a blip.
@_date: 2016-12-03 00:15:22
I don't think you're supposed to post this publically....
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:56:20
Thanks for the clarification. Glad the tax man won't get inaccurate info thinking I've been selling. Thanks Charlie!
@_date: 2016-12-30 11:32:25
Yes.. it's more secure. You could always opt in to using paper wallets. Google it. I would have more than just a usb copy as those can go bad. Oh and download electrum.. that's an alternative wallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:38:55
How is this fake news? They lost the electricity wasted and reward..... Maybe they should be using shitty buggy software?
@_date: 2016-11-03 00:53:04
That's why I'm asking. I remember OP_CAT being disabled. :-)
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:53:41
Yeah, but there are wallets with built in functionality to buy bitcoin within the wallet. After buying the bitcoin gets sent to your local wallet with keys under your control. A lot better than storing them on a centralized brokerage or exchange. Copay is one that does this.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:13:12
He was so wrong. Bitcoin hasn't topped yet.
@_date: 2016-11-02 08:59:59
How so?
@_date: 2016-12-12 05:55:16
Sure, which is why I said I disagree with anything coming to consensus HF wise within months. Years is more like it.
@_date: 2016-11-02 19:50:40
Are those ops safe?
@_date: 2016-11-05 22:38:54
"through Coinbase since you guys have offered it"
Because coinbase has issues, but totally ignoring that he's thinking your from coinbase and correcting that is real shitty.
@_date: 2016-12-24 06:53:07
One of them. I figured those were the accepts forms of verification, but you only needed one.
@_date: 2016-12-29 09:02:29
0, it isn't hard man.
@_date: 2016-11-05 22:55:12
They should, but that doesn't merit pretending to be them when commenting. Having a sub is good, and I'm glad it's up, but why pretend you're with coinbase unless someone calls you out?
@_date: 2016-12-27 03:05:56
Are you from the future? You can never know if something is at it's low or top. For all we know, ETH can go down even more and bitcoin go up, or they can both go down. Anything is possible man.
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:10:42
Yeah, paypal is venmo. paypal/venmo. :)
@_date: 2016-12-13 05:06:29
For me it's all the stupid shit I avoided buying at $490.
@_date: 2016-12-05 01:48:18
Leaving the minority chain leaves those clueless to what's going on to be able to be potentially frauded or double spent.
@_date: 2016-12-24 04:35:43
Try gemini... Works fine for me.. Verify with them and you get $500 instant ACH to  buy bitcoin directly on their exchange daily..
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:56:14
That's obvious, but the argument being made here is the LN would increase demand for blocksize and bring in more people paying fees. Ask any of the LN authors or those working on it. None of them think 1 MB is enough, that I know of, in the long term for LN.
@_date: 2016-12-27 03:43:51
You seem like a gambler thinking just because you won before it means anything at all when you scratch another lotto ticket. No just no.
@_date: 2016-12-03 08:35:22
So how can you personally say it's a solution if you haven't even ran any of the current implementations yourself? :P
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:47:25
Do your funds show as bitcoin or USD? If you converted to a USD account you can no long send to an external bitcoin address. You're out of luck there.
@_date: 2016-12-04 22:33:30
Yep, and somehow Cubans that come to Florida are qualified to become residents, but those fleeing cartel violence are rapists, murderers! 
@_date: 2016-12-03 01:50:56
It's dependent more than just the fee per transaction. It's fee per byte that matters. Bigger transactions require more of a fee. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 09:13:47
Hmm, well college demographic venmo is what's used. Perhaps in other demographics everyone uses Paypal? They're one in the same anyway since paypal owns venmo. It's more on the user experience and better user interface that paypal doesn't have.
@_date: 2016-11-04 23:04:27
I don't know. On r/btc they constantly bitch about backward compatibility with segwit.... Saying they won't be able to fully validate segwit transactions if they oppose, but on the other hand want to push a HF without full consensus which would have ZERO backwards compatibility with old nodes. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 08:52:21
Tell him to at least keep it in the non-multisig vault so he can't just get robbed blind.
@_date: 2016-12-03 08:23:53
I like lightning, but have you ran any of the implementations yourself?
@_date: 2016-12-04 23:47:11
Euro at a 12 year low man.

How is moving my own money to a wallet I control selling ever? If I withdraw dollars from my bank am I selling my dollars? 
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:33:23
Not under my name. Ehhhh
@_date: 2016-11-02 19:13:09
In your opinion are these scripts safe enough to be deployed on the main network?
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:47:35
He may been short 100x or something crazy.
@_date: 2016-11-16 06:39:29
Those signaling now have manually set it. No miner by default will start signaling even if segwit ready until the next difficulty retarget.
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:02:44
There is literally no point in using circle now. Venmo already has all my friends. They have no reason to use it. The only way I got some of them to use it was if they bought bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:02:25
You can send to an external wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-01 07:04:57
False.... for old wallets if you have more than 100 transactions you need to backup the wallet again. Otherwise if your computer fails and you try to use the backup it won't have the funds.
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:11:10
Make sure to leave a review on the app telling them what you think!
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:27:42
Miners could also participate in running LN nodes. They already have full nodes running so why not?
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:26:44
I'm trying to be helpful. Not all transactions are urgent or need to be confirmed promptly, but this reasoning doesn't work either. If everyone set a legitimate tx fee it would still be the same.
@_date: 2016-12-02 23:31:57
Sure thing! I know the UX for bitcoin wallets really needs to be improved.
@_date: 2016-12-17 05:44:08
Just leave a review telling them just that. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 03:18:47
Sure but claiming ETH (low) ... BTC (high) is subjective....
@_date: 2016-12-07 09:03:57
Please remember to back up your wallet seed in order to not lose funds if you lose your phone!
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:10:24
Your title seems a bit charged. Is it urgent to move from one wallet to another? If you use electrum I know it has a replace by fee so you can bump up the fee in the future if you really need funds by a certain time.
@_date: 2016-12-07 10:24:31
Try a different brokerage or exchange? If you have questions or need help feel free to ask here or direct message.
@_date: 2016-12-17 05:04:04
Oh TIL. Guess that's acceptable. I always see it thrown around that you spammed them back in the day. Sorry about that.
@_date: 2016-12-18 05:00:46
I grabbed softforks a few weeks ago  You'd be surprised 
@_date: 2016-12-27 03:34:03
Facts? Lmao.. At one point I had someone say it was bottom for ETH a few weeks ago, and here we see it dipping back under .01 BTC. Bottom my ass.
@_date: 2016-12-22 04:54:38
I wouldn't sell for paypal ever.
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:23:26
I'm not sure I'm following. I'm using Gemini, and Coinbase/GDAX... Never used a Eastern Euro exchange since 2013....
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:07:05
Seems you've done your research. Great job learning right away it's best to get a hardware wallet to keep your money secure!
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:22:45
Post on so you get both perspectives lol, note I'm not pro ethereum, just letting him know as you'll obviously get people here shit talking ETH, and people over there hyping it up like it's going to overtake bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:22:28
Seems people place these all around the city. I saw on on the floor and then this one on a pole back in June when I visited Prague. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 01:37:37
I think coinbase used to have an import function.. I recommend downloading a wallet and importing the funds there and then sending to coinbase from there.
Breadwallet as an import private key feature.
 
@_date: 2016-12-27 01:45:47
or on oh man they'll rip anyone with crypto there haha
@_date: 2016-12-11 11:41:00
It's just the same old dumb remarks being repeated when in reality segwit has been far more tested than BU. It's the kind of stuff seen daily rbtc.
@_date: 2016-11-19 07:19:04
Accurate here too showing more accurate numbers for segwit. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 09:06:07
They removed all buying and selling functionality other than converting your whole balance to USD and not being able to go back.
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:15:53
One. He has his own opinions and not everyone agrees with him, even core devs at times.
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:55:11
No sir. Because paypal transactions are reversible. You can easily be scammed on paypal. Once you send out a bitcoin transaction it's irreversible once confirmed. You can be charged back on paypal and lose your bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-31 22:17:49
There's barely any comments. I was a bit skeptical because of that.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:21:24
That's bullshit. Transferring in or out is not a sale...
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:23:09
Yes!!!!! It's a must go.
@_date: 2016-11-16 04:59:32
Bitcoinwisdom has a blocks left until the next retargeting period section if anyone is interested.
@_date: 2016-12-16 07:36:46
Try Gemini. Instant ACH, but you can't withdraw until it's cleared.
@_date: 2016-12-31 06:12:15
If he has a bigger HD, you can also set the datadirectory to be on the bigger HDD. Step one would be backing up the wallet.dat anyway.
@_date: 2016-12-12 05:32:01
No, it has only rejected unsafe HF's. How can you say the community doesn't want a safe HF proposed by core with rigorous testing, sane deployment strategies? Everything put out has been opposed for good reason, but that is in no way indicative of the community rejecting any hard fork in the near future. It also depends what you mean by near future too. If you mean years? I disagree. Months? Yes, totally.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:09:25
Yes, but you don't have full control of your money when it's in the bank. You can't SEPA me money from your bank to mine the U.S. or South America can you? It's different entirely.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:29:06
I know. I wish bitcoin could scale up safely, but we have to be slow and steady on how we increase capacity without hurting decentralization. I believe bitcoin wallet if on android also has cpfp so you can spend unconfirmed with a higher fee to confirm a past transaction if urgent.
 
@_date: 2016-11-12 03:11:05
Yes, which is why wallets use different receive address every time you receive money to avoid having every receiver of bitcoin you send money to know how much money you currently have.
@_date: 2016-12-24 05:14:06
USD.. I would try contacting their support. I worked something out with them as I don't pay for any utils either.
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:28:14
Sure, but preferable to them thinking windows 10 would be the better option.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:31:42
Yes, but in sentiment, I agree. I wish bitcoin was cheap, but hopefully, off-chain tech can accomplish this! I don't think we necessarily need bitcoin to settle every coffee transaction in the world as that doesn't scale in the slightest, but I do hope it'll be cheap enough to do it in some way even if not on chain.
@_date: 2016-12-07 09:05:32
For sending money to friends in the U.S. yes. 
@_date: 2016-11-09 23:15:07
Circle is cheaper and you get your bitcoins faster. :-)
@_date: 2016-11-04 23:03:00
This has been known for a while.. Via on the other hand.
@_date: 2016-11-21 02:54:08
Yep, perhaps they're showing support and will start signalling as soon as they can. It's better to be slow while upgrading to not break any mining infrastructure. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 09:07:50
No fees? Instant to each other. Almost everyone at least in my demographic has the app? Withdraws take a few days to hit the bank. :/ I guess it's similar to paypal sending to family and friends as that's free.
@_date: 2016-12-22 08:54:21
Who knows. FOMO might take off and this might be cheap, on the other hand it might drop like a rock. If anyone tells you otherwise they have an agenda or are full of shit
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:45:24
No, I wouldn't call Gates a Bitcoin Enthusiast.
@_date: 2016-12-16 23:53:19
Have you seen ETH? lol Unless you mean the smaller market cap currencies that no one uses.
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:46:57
Forget them.
@_date: 2016-11-11 19:05:14
They use breadwallet so it should work.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:15:21
I'll check it out. I'm primarily gonna be going to London, Amsterdam, and Germany.. I'll see what I can find there.
@_date: 2015-08-24 06:51:30
Aww. Does the place accept bitcoin? I wasn't going to buy or sell bitcoin, just to buy some coffee and have a date with my lady. :)
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:28:53
Can you explain it?
@_date: 2015-08-21 04:11:52
Can you even withdraw bitcoin yet? If not this company should not be on this subredddit.
@_date: 2015-08-20 01:12:54
At least it's a good ATM. Not a robocoin or other less known one.
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:45:54
Hey I'm going on vacation to Europe in December I'd love to know all the spots you went to or Bitcoin spots. :)
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:22:16
If there is a link or you send directly you will get your account closed.
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:53:25
I've got a U.S. card I could buy one for you in exchange for the Bitcoin if you so desire?
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:46:03
Mullvad 
@_date: 2015-08-08 17:08:54
They'd probably have to move to itbit or coinbase.
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:17:51
Why have you not been hired by blockstream ha?
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:03:34
19aaoiX4WQJd6S95TCJ9PuXMpiXN5oXQLd no problem! Thanks man! :)
@_date: 2015-08-18 05:03:24
I've never heard of this exchange 
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:08:00
Bitcoin doesn't scale yet. Why implement something that won't work if more than a few major players implemented it?
@_date: 2015-08-24 05:44:28
Sweet, I'm stopping by the end of December!
@_date: 2015-08-28 01:25:40
Spend millions on miners, but they can't spend a few thousand on a decent computer? Lmao
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:13:23
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:42:29
If there's one thing I half agree with you it's this.
@_date: 2015-07-21 20:48:12
That or it will have very low tps.
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:00:46
Holy shit
@_date: 2015-08-10 04:32:15
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:26:20
The problem is with miners actually including those transactions when they're actually risking real money in the block reward by doing so. The more tx's you include the more of a chance some other miner with less transactions in a block will get the main reward.
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:46:27
Funds are there already. For safety I'd send to a seed generated address as it's still in the old key just imported manually. I'm not sure if electrum does it automatically when you import an address. Basically send from the imported address to a new address in electrum if it doesn't and write down the seed! Here's my address :): 19aaoiX4WQJd6S95TCJ9PuXMpiXN5oXQLd

I wonder how much of a premium they will sell for.
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:17:04
You should really use a local wallet. breadwallet, Mycelium, or electrum on PC
@_date: 2015-07-10 19:12:09
Try circle?
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:45:41
Launches fine here. What iOS version are you on and what model?
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:43:41
Maybe the hacker hacked back in and leaked it :p
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:54:14
Some companies keep multisig keys in these things too you know.
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:50:05
Any way to help?

Got it thanks!

Doesn't WebRTC leak your ip address even under a vpn?
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:21:44
Backup the wallet.dat from the Bitcoin folder in %appdata% and then upgrade to the latest version of Bitcoin on Bitcoin.org. It'll sync much faster on the latest version
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:35:36
Coinbase and another from who knows where that sent me some Bitcoin since I helped him out.

Soon we will be able to side load open source software on iPhone!
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:38:45
Go stay in monero. You do realize if monero ever takes off you face the same problem?
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:09:41
The limit must be raised. Are we all in consensus?
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:56:30
Yeah but that requires him to download the entire blockchain.
@_date: 2017-04-02 00:32:11
Yep.. Fun while it lasted. Sigh.
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:10:18
Cue the PayPal conspiracy. /s
@_date: 2016-02-07 00:08:30
haha reminds me of streamium. I was able to get any stream for free by paying with testnet money by changing the url. Then they fixed it after I reported it. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 00:10:59
Yeah, I don't blame him. A little slow, but better than signalling for BU.
@_date: 2016-02-07 09:21:54
They actually fixed it real quick after I told them. It was early on when there was a lot of buzz. Man I could have enjoyed free streamium for a while. :P
@_date: 2017-04-26 03:29:13
Classic has the same issue and released a patch
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:27:55
Not without the opt-in flag. Therefore opt-in. Satoshi had it in before. I don't understand the conspiracy. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 02:48:45
Xapo manages the cold wallet? That's new. BitGo with the hot wallet with multisig. There's only ~60k verified users. That's what I got out of it so far.
@_date: 2016-02-24 05:49:32
You could argue softforks do the same.
@_date: 2016-02-23 23:52:38
That's why it's opt-in? No merchant would accept those. Scorched earth is different.
@_date: 2016-02-10 18:44:43
I'm sorry but where exactly are they taking credit for speed improvements you've done?
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:30:48
Did you not read what I said.... Roger and Jihan collectively hold high level bitcoin domains. It's BS that it's that much of a barrier.
@_date: 2016-02-24 02:17:00
How does increasing it to 4MB do that? 1MB is absurdly small for a worldwide currency.
@_date: 2016-02-13 09:17:20
Any idea when IBM will use this tech to sell or to buy extra or needed server space/computation. ;)
@_date: 2017-04-10 02:42:59
Nah, a lot of us already had a full node up and are just showing support.
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:25:14
I received two transactions in the last hour. They both confirmed quickly!
@_date: 2016-02-11 23:22:51
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:15:49
haha, pretty funny.
@_date: 2016-02-17 19:02:43
I mean if you trust me. Limit your connections and up the relay fee a bit on your node and you'll save a ton of speed/bandwidth. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:55:32
Ah Good thing I was using a very old image.
@_date: 2016-02-18 07:26:49
I'd love a large!
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:03:52
Bullshit. Roger has much sway and publicity and he owns BITCOIN.COM, Jihan owns btc.com, these nonsensical oh but if there wasn't censorship people would be for it. Yeah... no.
@_date: 2016-02-17 18:57:40
It isn't safe for me to just give you mine. Just download bitcoin-qt on any computer you have and let it sync. Then copy it to your 21 computer.
@_date: 2016-02-23 23:36:54
Why can't we have both?
@_date: 2016-02-17 18:48:45
Do you have a regular computer? Just download it on a separate computer and then transfer it?
@_date: 2016-02-24 05:33:25
Sigh. I'm not saying increase it to 20MB. Just to levels that are safe. I wish we could have had a fork in place a year ago to have been activated with a year lead time, but we got infighting instead. I'd rather have a 6 month lead time at this time, but I guess I'll settle with what the roundtable agreed.
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:10:23
This should be based off segwit to activate after. Segwit is mature software waiting for activation, if this can be tweaked, feature creep removed, and able to be activated after segwit or at least not requiring for it to be tweaked many more would be for it.
@_date: 2016-02-17 18:52:20
They made almost 4 million there. Whoa.
@_date: 2016-02-21 07:48:49
That's what classic did. lol
@_date: 2017-04-09 07:12:35
I have yours on my car. . . Can confirm haha
@_date: 2017-04-02 07:56:08
Riverside California? I'm nearby if so. Let's start one up.
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:11:48
 scan it with this site and enter your passphrase to decrypt. From there you can import the private key to electrum(ltc version of course) if you need specific help you can ask away.
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:27:59
I said either or, I know the logic is there, but man it needs to be done now. Bitcoin still sorely lacks in user experience. I really hope segwit gets in soon. :)
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:08:32
No one  wants FT dude. No LN devs, no HW devs... Just put it away. Or might as well include it in a HF as you have all the time in the world to work on integrating it. Not a priority you say, what else are you even doing?
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:16:20
I just sent a TX from it like 25 minutes ago just fine?
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:09:11
At this point I'd be fine with 4MB
@_date: 2016-02-24 02:09:52
So why the fuss over opt in replace by fee? That code actually does follow that policy. I'd rather have that. Even saying that you don't know if miners will enforce it is a good reason that you can't trust zero-conf trx's
@_date: 2017-04-02 23:46:04
this looks way better
@_date: 2017-04-01 03:51:06
Side 4: For every new softforks with technical merit, miners will do the exact same thing as segwit and force the community/devs to increase the blocksize further before signally any new softfork...
I say no, you're giving them precedent to do this. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 03:40:07
They kinda have to if all the users go there first?
@_date: 2016-02-03 05:34:51
I'm sorry but this should not be here. They still haven't added the bitcoin withdraw feature that was "coming soon" for months now. 
@_date: 2016-02-17 18:52:59
What is corrupt? Just the node or the entire 21 computer.
@_date: 2017-04-10 06:50:29
Gemini is one. Well with authy, but that's bad.
@_date: 2016-02-17 05:01:34
Do they even have any experience with blockchains?
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:08:17
Does CPFP fix this? If so it needs to be implemented asap with wallets being updated to be able to avoid uncof tx and prefer confirmed coins for spending and or including a higher fee with CPFP for a better user experience.
@_date: 2017-04-10 07:46:57
They support google auth stye 2fa which is secure, but authy specific 2fa is also vulnerable to phone porting.
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:53:59
Holy, I was running this for a few months before switching to Windows 10 a few week back.
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:06:07
I'd love for it to be streamed and have everything more open instead of FED style meetings? Overall I feel like it's a good compromise and am glad Classic forced this. I hope this reaches consensus.
@_date: 2016-09-24 04:16:45
Legit. Bitcoin doesn't have a closing for trading. Although, I'd research exchanges before using anyway.
@_date: 2016-09-21 19:57:12
I didn't see an ATM there in July. By the way, you guys have the best Chicken Nachos ever!
@_date: 2016-09-14 05:17:48
That worked.
@_date: 2016-09-13 06:24:41
I don't keep my life savings on it. Spending change just like I do in my regular wallet with the rest in local wallets I control. :-)
@_date: 2016-09-19 22:01:58
Coincenter was giving them away! I have one. It's awesome. :-)
@_date: 2016-09-07 17:04:00
Seems doable. It's like the contacts it has now but probably more integrated and hidden away. Not sure how payments look in messages
@_date: 2016-09-22 06:40:18
I missed out. I'll try them if I'm ever back in Berlin. Paying with bitcoin of course. ;)
@_date: 2016-09-14 05:19:10
If they send dollars to say my account it converts it to Bitcoin as that's what I have set.
@_date: 2016-09-15 23:13:19
It's good for pocket change not as my bank with thousands in it.. :-)
@_date: 2016-09-14 06:19:16

It helps that you can set it to whatever currency you're more comfortable with. Friends won't feel like eww it's only bitcoin when will I ever use this? But in this case they will and I can still benefit by receiving any dollars they send my way as bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-09-14 05:13:54
So what? No one would use it if it was just bitcoin. The reverse works with fiat sent to me I'll get as bitcoin. Converted on the fly. :-)
@_date: 2016-09-18 19:57:09
Sign up for circle, less issues
@_date: 2016-09-13 23:32:10
Same, it works fine on my iPad... It can only send though, not request.. Venmo has it one-upped as it has both send and request functionality as I saw at a glance. 
@_date: 2016-09-15 20:56:20
It's sort of implied, but 2 trillion from China in what I'm guessing is denominated in bitcoin. :O

She worked on distributed systems, she's new to bitcoin but I'm sure she'll catch on real fast. She's really smart when you talk to her in person.
@_date: 2016-09-01 00:26:11
I know right? Letting users have a choice is great.. Now Europeans can set their currency as Euro, and they can send me Euros which I'll receive as bitcoin. :-)
@_date: 2016-09-14 02:58:24
You have to install, but you can send to someone that doesn't have it and they just have to sign up to get it. They'll still get the message to claim it.
@_date: 2016-09-19 22:40:23
My node has 14.5k unconfirmed. It's probably a lot of old dust transactions or old transactions being relayed again...
@_date: 2016-09-06 18:50:51
It's corny as hell. It's more similar to Zcash's story, ha.
@_date: 2016-09-23 15:50:19
Have you asked the LN guys? Lol
@_date: 2016-09-12 07:21:57
You will be overdrafted. You could still try contacting support if it's early enough?
@_date: 2016-09-06 23:20:48
Bitaccess. I zoomed in. They probably partnered up with them.
@_date: 2016-09-17 06:28:41
Same, circle is generally so much easier to use for regular folk.
@_date: 2016-09-01 02:39:27
Yeah. That was my first thought. I love how they even said she took it from her cold storage.
@_date: 2016-02-10 02:45:23
Not live for me either. (US here)
@_date: 2016-09-17 23:15:31
Blockstream didn't invent LN.... The LN team isn't blockstream, blockstream does however have one or two guys working on it.
@_date: 2016-09-14 02:56:33
I updated before the update... I should try deleting the app and retrying. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 03:50:29
I'd hope you didn't just save them on SD cards?
@_date: 2016-09-19 22:02:29
Thanks for shipping them out for free a while back!
@_date: 2016-09-20 00:00:00
I've been meaning to do this. Right now I only have minute snapshots of unconfirmed tx  Mempool size etc.
@_date: 2016-09-13 00:57:52
They give you the choice. I'd say that's powerful.
@_date: 2016-09-13 04:44:57
I've found friends using the app that know nothing about bitcoin! Set in USD, but if they sent any my way I'd get bitcoin. That's awesome in my eyes. They don't even need to know. :-)
@_date: 2016-09-15 21:31:40
I'm not sure if it'll last forever, but for now it's true! No catches. They do charge a small few by having the price be a few dollars higher.
@_date: 2015-04-25 05:25:51
It is charging. Don't you see the icon next to the battery icon. :P
@_date: 2015-04-25 17:40:49
You should probably contact antpool now. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:49:12
Genesis block. Get it? They buy sell Bitcoin blocks. :p
@_date: 2015-04-21 03:07:01
No. This isn't something all businesses can leverage. Small business owners don't get to do this.

I actually asked the guy behind promethease a while back to do it!(more than a year ago) Nice to actually see it implemented through stripe! Just paid with bitcoin and waiting on my report. :-) 
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:56:19
Heck, I'd be excited too if I received $400. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:45:51
Bit is just a unit though right? It's like saying the price in ones or the price in 20s?
@_date: 2015-04-17 18:52:04
Sounds like us. haha. If it worked for them. hmmmm
@_date: 2015-04-26 01:52:39
Try circle +coinbase.
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:58:41
On the flipside bitcoin would be global and usable by anyone, so you would expect it to need way more than 10k txs per second.
@_date: 2015-09-19 03:53:20
Why stay with something that's good now but move on to something more secure in the long run? Nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:53:46

A lot of people buy Bitcoin and hold it.. Does that not count as adoption? I wouldn't have saved as much if I didn't put it in bitcoin.

Yup, I'm using it right now with my iPhone. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 05:22:07
Brace yourself for the possibility. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 14:47:53
Didn't they already have a first round for only a couple million before that. ;)
@_date: 2015-04-01 02:34:26
Just goes to show where the incentives are. You can't break btc itself so they instead profit off of it.
@_date: 2015-04-24 19:27:52
They seem to paint it being low, but I think that's high. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 10:29:31
Holy shit! This couldn't be timed any better. To the moon!
@_date: 2015-04-03 01:55:51
Bitcoin already used proof of stake in a different way for determining priority when sending txs right?
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:01:03
I've actually been wanting to make something like this for a while now. I don't have a mac, though so I can't actually follow through with it yet. I was going to grab breadwallet's source code and remove all wallet functionality and keep the scan qr button to quickly check an address. Soon tm. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:37:00

Seriously what does it take to be a mod? I nominate myself..
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:10:28
Well I haven't heard of anyone losing money from Xapo, so you've got that going for you too.
@_date: 2015-04-09 18:50:34
+1.. I bought 90 days worth and I've been happy with it so far on my desktop. Early iOS 8 versions have trouble with VPNs and randomly disconnect, but that's not on mullvad's end. Sometimes it's slow, but it gets the job done for the price. No email or personal info needed either so that's a big plus.
@_date: 2015-04-25 07:54:43
It would probably take more for a less established business. I'm sure coinbase has many more connections than say a small startup that barely formed this year.
@_date: 2015-04-11 02:00:13
Did you include a fee? If you didn't sending a pennies worth without a mining fee will never get it confirmed. Try grouping a transaction like that and sending again.
@_date: 2015-04-21 04:09:38
Hey, I fixed some of them previously on github. He accepted a pull request for a typo. I'm sure if you went on and fixed all of that and asked to have it merged he'd do it.
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:39:46
I'm worried Xapo will be the next one to go bust. How many users do they have? I hope all these sponsoring are helping them attract new users to their site.
@_date: 2015-04-27 18:14:35
Do you have some sort of QoS so it doesn't eat all your bandwidth?
@_date: 2015-04-11 02:28:54
That makes much more sense. I thought you were sending yourself bitcoin. In that case the game probably paid for the fee and the wallet was just waiting for a block to be mined..(something that happens on average every ten minutes in bitcoin) If you can try to withdraw from the game in chunks if it lets you so it doesn't waste most of your balance if you're paying for the fees from the balance in the game.
@_date: 2015-04-28 02:03:50
Use a vpn
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:38:12
Is there no recourse in doing this if you live in the U.S. No laws being broken? Not that I would agree with breaking the law if it were illegal.
@_date: 2015-04-13 03:47:50
Maybe it'll tie into blockchain tech somehow.
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:18:30
Apps like circle have you input the dollar amount first which has a different exchange rate and that causes problems.
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:16:06
Price in bits*
@_date: 2015-04-12 03:02:58
I asked to be a mod to see for myself why stuff like this is done, but I doubt they'll let me be one or even consider.
@_date: 2015-04-25 03:50:36
So generous! 
@_date: 2015-04-06 05:53:52
Just got the email.

I didn't see the app advertised on the sit a while back. Downloaded. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:51:13
Wasn't that disabled. As in you can't buy them with bitcoin for some reason. (haven't tried myself)
@_date: 2015-04-25 04:10:36
It only gets cheaper the more down to earth they get.

They need a mobile app, then they're golden.

Hey guys, if you type in the amount of bitcoin you control and end it with btc, it'll show up like this: ** btc. automatically protects your balance like it does with passwords. /s Try it yourself!

Avoiding tax? Or is that on the receiver to pay

Keep spending funds on a local wallet. That way you'll never run into this.

And if resold the newbie would have a device that would not work out of the box!

Write down phrase and save in safe location. Done.
@_date: 2015-09-23 00:54:56
You can make money off lightning hubs? As well as partnerships for these devices to be integrated into other products or server farms. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 05:00:49
How did you get this opportunity. So jealous. :-)
@_date: 2015-04-25 21:14:52
I sometimes browse it for the drama and was wondering why it wouldn't load on my phone yesterday. ha
@_date: 2015-09-23 00:34:12
It can always be shifted into using lightning hubs instead.
@_date: 2015-04-20 15:41:21
I've heard nothing but bad things, but  glad to know the user base is increasing. I wouldn't know how you're doing, I'm basing it off community response to Xapo. Coinbase has their wallet numbers on their site and people regularly post about circle here on reddit while I don't see the same for Xapo. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:15:41
Did I forget the /s. I thought "timing" would be enough of a hint ha.

Same one that was written about in Bitgold but for this year?
@_date: 2015-04-25 04:36:57
I use mullvad. You can pay any amount for any the specified time you want in Bitcoin and they give you a discount if you do use Bitcoin. There's also a three hour trial I believe. You can try it out and buy however much time you want if you're satisfied with it.
@_date: 2015-04-25 05:27:19
Nope. Still the same amount of hours. It won't subtract more if you pick other locations.
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:13:02
Good luckk distributing anything in life evenly and fairly. Bitcoin didn't solve that problem and it never meant to. On the other hand it it does provide an even playing field to use the platform.
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:55:27
So they're paying you now?
@_date: 2016-10-29 23:55:58
Better than nothing. :-)
@_date: 2015-09-07 08:03:21
With $5 24 hour volume! Looks healthy... /s
@_date: 2015-04-11 03:01:56
They do just make sure what you're buying is directly from Newegg and not the marketplace.
@_date: 2016-10-29 20:54:47
It also makes it harder for those with crappy hardware to sync up with the network.
@_date: 2016-10-28 07:07:52
He should really just update to a newer version...
@_date: 2016-10-18 00:47:41
They forgot to bump it, but yeah still in rc phase to find mistakes like this. ;-)
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:29:26
I was looking at a few blocks... There's a lot of abnormal transactions.. Long chains with high fees for no reason using the same starting output. A ton of ~huge~ transactions having a ton of small .0005 outputs and joining them together.. Why do that right now?
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:57:22
If you click send money instead of the qr option yea. Most newbies will end up clicking and going through the send money route.
@_date: 2015-04-13 03:55:05
HBO now is doing a one month trial if you're interested.
@_date: 2016-10-30 07:19:36
What issue were you having?
@_date: 2016-10-02 06:59:39
It seems a lot of other people got into bitcoin this way too. I was running folding and also set that up on my PS3 as well back in the time when you could also run linux on it. Good times.
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:19:06
Do you use CPFP for incoming deposits that are stuck to fulfill withdrawals?
@_date: 2015-04-29 23:10:59
Use a SPV wallet like Breadwallet for iOS,  Mycelium for Android, or electrum for PC. So you don't have to download the whole blockchain to use it.
@_date: 2016-10-19 23:00:31
My impulse buys lead me to use brokerages and transferring them to cold storage. I agree overall though!
@_date: 2015-04-19 02:04:01
No, if localbitcoins gets hacked or one of their employees goes rogue and steals the cold walelt funds all your bitcoin are gone. I recommend storing them on coinbase on a multisig vault, or a wallet like breadwallet on iOS. (Normally I would tell anyone to store all their btc on a mobile phone, but if you back up the phrase, it is still magnitudes much safer than leaving it all on localbitcoins)
@_date: 2016-10-04 02:54:06
Doubt it. He has his own company Bloq. Most likely a partnership?
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:09:10
I think increasing the space for segwit transactions while keeping the current limit on regular transactions is thew way to go in the long term.
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:37:17
Make sure your name is exactly what you have on your records. Any different and it'll deny you. I've experienced this with friends.
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:27:03
Coinbase isn't pushing out outgoing transactions on my end....
@_date: 2016-10-29 08:16:31
Yes and there are a ton of issues with just raising it.
@_date: 2016-10-01 19:42:42
Yeah, crossborder venmo with cash withdraws or deposits built in.. Circle is sort of the same, but more focused for the banked.
@_date: 2016-10-30 03:53:03
Yes, variance in times blocks are found. They aren't always ten minutes apart. That's why you have some blocks taking way more than ten minutes. Totally normal.
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:14:33
Yep. Amounts, usage patterns. There's a ton of data that can all point you out. At most mixers are good for having privacy from most other users than government entities for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:58:06
It seems to be another spam attack in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-10-29 23:49:41
A miner continuously exploiting this or even just stupidly including these transactions from a user doing it. 1 out of a million isn't nothing I agree.
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:13:13
So is coinbase/circle going to ban accounts that send bitcoin to NETELLER??
@_date: 2015-03-12 05:10:05
I recommend you switching to  Bitcoin core downloads the whole blockchain(which is every transaction made on the blockchain since the beginning). Electrum lets you send and receive bitcoin without having to download all the blocks. It'll take a few hours to sync maybe a day! Don't freak out, your funds are still there.
@_date: 2016-10-29 20:55:21
Yes, it's a huge problem for nodes trying to sync if continuous!
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:56:46
I saw some too on the way home from school! Pretty gnarly. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 07:05:14
Not really... Just pay a higher fee and it'll get sorted. It sucks we can't scale up to everyone right now, but we can't just open the flood gates without taking into consideration how much that hurts decentralization. You can still run a bitcoin node. There is not ddos there preventing people from running nodes on regular hardware. I'm running one myself.
@_date: 2015-04-27 22:30:03
Hi. Need proof.
@_date: 2015-03-03 21:55:07
What happens when someone is nearby? Do they show up in the send field? It's off by default right?
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:51:29
You can still hook up your cc. It will most likely still work, but it isn't "officially" supported. You can be anonymous, you just have to buy locally from something like local bitcoins. Companies like circle have to comply with regulations and aml/kyc or else they get shut down or fined by the government. Remember they're linking up to the legacy system so you can buy them. You can still send your bitcoin to a local wallet and mix them if you want privacy if you buy from circle. It's not that buying bitcoin is hard, it's selling your fiat money what's hard.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:05:11
And now 7 of the last 8.
@_date: 2015-11-17 18:33:27
Love the slack!
@_date: 2016-10-29 04:17:49
So do you expect thousands of computers to verify and store your transaction for almost free in a trustless manner? I hope bitcoin is cheap to use in the long run, but it makes sense that when we're in a limited capacity for blocksize that we emphasize security and priorities our behavior with transactions. If it's urgent pay more. If it's a few bucks, do you really need global consensus for that every time?
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:33:14
Yes, they are. Did you check the link? coinbase.com right? They're known and trusted. A simple google search brings up that they've been around for years and have notable investors such as the New York Stock Exchange!
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:26:33
roostock. By the way I own ether and I'm saying this.
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:11:51
So those auctions buyers buying from the gov are shit out of luck?
@_date: 2015-09-22 23:47:25
Yeah, I still don't understand why people think these devices are for generating bitcoin for profit when that is in no way true directly. These devices also need no kyc and can be sold or used anywhere as long as you have an internet connection and electricity!

Try spending from a local wallet and not one from circle or Coinbase. They sometimes take forever to send out transactions. This isn't the case for local wallets. Try breadwallet!
@_date: 2016-10-10 07:15:53
It shouldn't even be an option to have that level of stupidity

Buy a trezor!  You seem to have enough to warrant one. Or you could learn how to do a paper wallet backup if you prefer that route. While I like breadwallet, I wouldn't keep 8 bitcoin on it! Here are the steps for a  paper wallet if you do go that route. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:25:22
We could always push for them to add bitcoin to their API. Most payment processors do.. They could partner with bitpay or coinbase and go the stripe route of first allowing their merchants to accept it and receive cash and maybe later add the option to receive bitcoin itself if the merchant wants it.
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:30:11
Don't you need ports open to be a full node?

I too used to be afraid and kept what little bitcoin I had on coinbase back in the day. I then followed a guide like the one moral posted and practiced sending and recovering small amounts of coin to a paper wallet until I felt good enough to send most of what I had to cold storage.
@_date: 2015-03-17 05:16:07
Any idea why you're having a field for refunds instead of using the payment protocol?
@_date: 2015-03-05 07:48:19
How are you still active here. I'd expect you would quit bitcoin or hate it after going through that. I'm not sure if I would even stay. :-(
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:15:17
Demand is big, and people are paying to get in blocks. That's great, even when we wish we could safely scale to all world users when we can't.

Try circle.com. They give you $500 of instant buys for bank accounts. I think it starts off at $100 and then goes to $500. I don't remember. Mine shows $500 instant and I only have a bank account set up with it.
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:27:46
Unreliable how? I was able to buy just fine for the one located near me in Brea, but wasn't able to get verified as it glitched out.
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:29:17
You work for them?
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:03:50
It should have worked. I checked the address that you sent to and you did indeed send the right amount with three confirmations so far.
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:04:08
Click on sweep. That works too. Make sure you have the electrum phrase copied down on paper. After you sweep it your money will be in electrum.
@_date: 2016-10-25 19:06:42
@_date: 2015-03-06 20:23:15
Some of my addresses are whole numbers. I probably shouldn't do that for privacy reasons to be honest.
@_date: 2015-03-11 06:31:45
Well that explains it.. Dang. Mine was $740. ouch.
@_date: 2015-03-07 03:46:36
Oh that's what you meant. I think shopify or their other processor (don't know what they use) handles the credit card transactions so it's not exactly coinbase processing that themselves.
@_date: 2016-10-31 04:38:42

@_date: 2016-05-24 21:17:10
1. They have a shit ton of funding, they could have been building the application layer libraries for bitcoin to be easy for developers, but didn't
2. 21.co is doing this... You can't expect a bunch of volunteers to do it? (Eth was able to do it with the huge premine)
3. Are you funding lightning or other tech to scale bitcoin, or even trying to scale in R&amp;D instead of just wanted to push it down the road?
4. Rootstock?

The dumb thing about it is that making it illegal only punished the legal uses as the kidnappers or whatever could still ask for Bitcoin after the fact???!

Step one, get USD on btce. For most people, good luck with that.

How about add an extra few confirmation requirements if one miner mines more than 4 consecutive blocks for services relying on 6 confirmations.

Bad idea. If you're this new at this you should not be implementing wallets on your own. At most you could use coinbase's api.
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:58:58
The problem is people were using it like a wallet, storing large amounts on it. This shouldn't happen.

The more popular Bitcoin gets the less we'll need an exchange for people to people trades.

@_date: 2015-10-13 17:43:00
I'm not sure if I recall, but for users that want to withdraw to the main chain that will still take a ton of confirmations right? I guess that's the only downside unless exchanges had reserves on the main chain for that. Or is that only for the trustless peg and not federated?
@_date: 2016-10-29 20:40:46

They have an incentive to do this if they themselves were users of Evo and got fucked or lost a lot. Almost every other heist they've stayed quiet.

@_date: 2015-03-08 02:48:17
Yes, imagine this with millions of users. Doesn't the risk go up more the more users they have? I don't see how it can scale. I wish coinbase would slowly transition to having actual wallets with bitcoin stored locally and backed up with a phrase or go the greenaddress route.

Down for me too via the app and through my laptop. This is why I recommend having a local wallet like breadwallet or electrum. You don't have to worry about your money not being available due to blockchain.info, circle, or coinbase being down. If you want to buy and one is down I suggest signing up for coinbase or alternatives in case your main site for buying or selling is down! I like circle for buying buy the way, just not the wallet aspect of it.
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:35:51
Just stripe. (.5% is them converting it to usd to send to you) There's also a miners fee, but the user pays that not the merchant. (miners fee is a few cents worth)

Why not in a local wallet? A wallet going down is exactly you don't want to store money with them. They're great for buying, but not for storing money that you need or use as a wallet.

Uh? No they don't. You can pay directly with bitcoin to a qr code coinbase provides. Where did you get this idea from? (It's only when the merchant specifically puts the option to only accept directly from coinbase that this is the case)
@_date: 2016-05-23 01:31:55
A few, but they were a bit rough due to network issues and merchants going offline because of it. Most of those were fixed in future releases though!

What I personally would prefer is having a service like this but for android pay. Basically you have a wallet with a bitcoin balance. You could for instance have a greenaddress type wallet where you control 2 keys and greenaddress another. (Timelocked of course) Therefore when you go to tap to pay at any store that has NFC payments you can pay with bitcoin and have it send but have an intermediary convert that and use a one time credit card token or whatever to pay. This is for now. As more and more businesses are adding NFC support there will be payment POS like NCR that accept bitcoin and integrate it with the main POS(not just the tablet version) and with a flip of a switch, in a few years millions, of businesses could knowingly accept bitcoin. You could even interface it so it accepts it by default and converts it for the merchants that don't know about it. Think about it, you wouldn't even need to tell the merchant like Chipotle that you're paying in bitcoin, you just whip out your phone and tap to pay like you would with apple pay. We could then at this point advocate for businesses to keep a percentage of it in bitcoin or as employees ask to be paid part of our salary in bitcoin. /end rant 
@_date: 2015-03-07 00:01:47
It was an old guide I wrote for importing keys from bitcoin core to electrum and sending them to keys generated from the seed. This was for the old electrum. I haven't really played with the new one so I wasn't as much help to see why it didn't work with 2.0. Thanks for helping him though! 
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:18:16
Not sure. You could always buy bitcoin instantly with a fee of course and sell it on the exchange to bypass the time if you need to trade now.
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:22:11
Most normal non-technical users should not run full nodes as it is not user friendly and inefficient for the end user.  Overall I disagree. It's perfectly fine to use light wallets. I got the wrong idea and thought you were a new user using bitcoin core as your main wallet. People should be running nodes, but if you're new I'd push them to something easier so they don't get scared away by having to wait days just to be able to use bitcoin....

Sure thing. I have quite a few locations a few cities away that accept bitcoin, but I only really go if I'm in the area. I use airbitz or coinmap just to know so if I happen to be in the area I'll stop by not necessarily to seek them out. Ha

It isn't an online wallet! It uses this thing called spv so you don't need to download the whole blockchain. Your keys/bitcoin are all stored on your computer which are never sent to anyone that can spend from your funds.

Yes, you're gambling the price will stay the same or go up. Most of us here that got in in the beginning of 2014 have cost averages in the 400s, 500s, or even 600s if we stopped buying.

With Bitcoin technically you can use it in seconds, well if you send from one wallet to another local wallet. As for online wallets Coinbase now only requires needs 3 confirmations unless that's because I'm fully verified, not sure for new users 
@_date: 2015-02-08 09:28:26
They need it because the government requires them to obtain that info or risk being shut down due aml/kyc laws. The hard part isn't buying bitcoin it's selling fiat legally. :p and yes circle is trustworthy. Try coinbase too, they may not require a scan of your Id on coinbase. :-) I personally have used both.

That's only because he reused the same address at the time. Nowadays he'd have an HD wallet creating new addresses for every transaction and new receiving addresses every time he received money. This would make it harder to see everything altogether like this. :P

I like this idea: Encrypt the P2P protocol. This would annoy NSA/GCHQ and other agencies like them, because then they couldn't build mappings of name-&gt;address using DPI. Of course they can still run nodes and collect a random subset of the traffic, but it at least forces them to donate resources to us. This is easier, but I don't plan to do it myself any time soon.

 here's the code. Keep in mind there are a number of different implementations that gave that have the same consensus. If you fork it and change the limit it is no longer bitcoin, it's an "altcoin" on a totally different network or rejected by the  current network. One huge reason it will never change (the limit) is due to incentives. Miners will never agree to it. It'd be shooting themselves in the foot, making their current coins and mining rigs worth less.
@_date: 2015-02-20 04:43:12
Yes, but it's still in beta and not as fully integrated as stripe has with bitcoin. ;) Stripe made it seamless and easy. I'm sure braintree will too but they also require you to also have a coinbase account atm. (negative of stripe not doing the same means they convert all of the bitcoin accepted right now to fiat)

Yes, I agree, but there's still the risk of having it hacked remotely through an exploit through the web browser or another attack vector.

Hard forks nowadays would be done ahead of time and not enabled until more than a certain percentage of the network is shown to have updated. This is done to avoid issues or splitting the network without consensus.

 The sale of a borrowed security, commodity or currency with the expectation that the asset will fall in value. Basically if it does indeed go down you profit or can lose money if the price starts going up if you get out.

@_date: 2015-02-12 17:39:48
I've been waiting for this moment too!  It really isn't a fair comparison since Coinbase is still doing the promotional free trading while bitstamp currently has fees.
@_date: 2015-02-14 07:27:26
I'm in the same boat as you! I put buying on hold due to irl expenses though... 
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:29:05
Not real to them unless she starts talking about it lol
@_date: 2015-02-09 06:04:27
I never cheated and legitimately played and won some bits and now this. Wtf?  wow it even crashes the app so I can't even play without winning. You do know people if they're determined enough will patch out the jailbreak detection code or bypass it. This update blows.
@_date: 2015-03-06 05:43:33
You can buy a small amount every paycheck. Check out Coinbase.com or circle.com :-)

@_date: 2015-02-09 08:46:43
Can you remove the silly jailbreak detection and instead look for abuses in getting paid out other ways?Dedicated advance users will find a workaround while a ton of legitimate users that are jailbroken that do so for the same reason we use bitcoin won't even be able to play. It pains me to update and have the app crash without previous warning? I wouldn't have updated if I knew...  
@_date: 2015-02-07 08:45:21
Pretty sure that's how it is now with most other currencies? -gasp- bitcoin can't solve everything!
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:28:47

I forgot about that. That makes it a much bigger accomplishment. The day it beats finex in volume is when the real celebration begins.
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:09:03
USD isn't instant. They need to wait for it to clear. The instant is a different service that they charge the 1% that happens off the exchange since they are risking you running off and reversing your bank transfer after you get the bitcoin. They can't risk this for trades that happen on an actual exchange since they would need to roll back trades if it's a big amount or take a loss. It would be a huge disaster in the making. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:32:42
Local trader. Less than a percent 
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:48:09
Didn't know you were into bitcoin that much. haha. Love RES and glad to have you on changetip. :-)
@_date: 2015-02-15 07:21:50
No, you can't. Through gyft you can through some of those. The McDonalds rumor was just that a rumor that came about them releasing a video about accepting a new form of payment which ended up being this:  I remember so many people pumping this on twitter and spreading it when it obviously wasn't bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-19 05:01:06
Vendors will continue to get robbed too. At one point I'd think sellers would move on to markets like this the easier it gets.
@_date: 2015-02-27 01:50:40
Thanks it worked now!
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:28:18
Pretty much. I tested the USD wallet out first by sending $20 bucks a few months back to see how long it would take. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:26:10
It's probably the mix of the fee being charged when you purchased it and the market tanking a bit.
@_date: 2015-02-24 04:34:51
You can send to more than one address in one transaction though right?

@_date: 2015-02-20 17:58:16
Nice to have you on board. The price can still crash so be careful and not put too much that you can't afford to lose!

He's mentioned legality and doesn't want to get arrested. What I said is good advice. It's none of my business, but I wouldn't advise anyone to sell to a random person saying they're going to use it to buy drugs. That's one of the reasons the Florida man got arrested. . .

Yes, that phrase let's you recover your money and start your wallet on another phone if you break or lose your phone! (write it down somewhere) If you take a screenshot it will most likely get backed up to icloud. (if you have that enabled) If icloud is hacked by a hacker(remember the leaked nudes?) or an employee sees your phrase through the screenshot your bitcoin is as good as gone as they'll be able to steal them.
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:00:54
You never know if they'll ever keep a small percent or pay employees a percentage that want to paid in it. It's progress. :)
@_date: 2015-02-20 06:25:18
I did too!
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:18:03
To put things into perspective. I'm willing to be more people have jailbroken a device or had one than people have own bitcoin (well more than a few dollars worth). Back in early March of 2013 there were 18.2 million unique jailbroken devices. That was two years ago.
@_date: 2016-05-08 04:38:24
How is that volume real?

Basically don't use this client. Think of it as a client for more advanced users that want full decentralization. For convenience use electrum.. It doesn't make you download the entire blockchain on your computer for you to use. Check it out. Or check out a mobile wallet. Breadwallet on iOS and Mycelium on Android
@_date: 2015-02-14 07:29:51

So first create a new wallet on electrum. It'll create a seed you can copy down. Write this down and keep it somewhere safe!
Go on bitcoin qt -&gt; click on help -&gt; click on debug window -&gt; click on Console...
I'm not sure how many addresses you generated but you can type:
dumpprivkey "your address here"
The address being the money you sent to from LocalBitcoins(or wherever you send them from), if you have other addresses with bitcoin you'll have to repeat this. /
If you have your bitcoin-qt encrypted type this into the console before using the dumpprivkey command:
walletpassphrase "your password here without quotes " 100
Okay so it will give you a private key you can copy and paste into electrum.
Go back into Electrum -&gt; Click on Wallet toolbar -&gt; click on Private Keys -&gt; Click on import -&gt; paste private key from the bitcoin qt console.
Now in the send tab in electrum you can send from the address you just imported by right clicking the old address -&gt; send from -&gt; copy a newly generated address from electrum and send to that.. Now your seed will be able to recover those funds if your computer breaks down etc.
Sorry if it's too confusing and long. Not user friendly at all. :( Hope it helps, if not then I'll try to be more specific.  (this is an old rough guide I made a while back for a user that was also in the same position as you, if you get stuck I'll try to help ya out)

Just the other day I was able to withdraw bitcoin without 2FA on coinbase.. I have it set up so it needs it for any amount.... I was able to make small withdraws and even withdrew everything from my coinbase account without inputing a 2FA token to confirm. I never got an explanation on why this happened...... I can't even imagine how much more freaked out I would have been if I had hundreds of coins on it.. I even restarted and cleared my browser and it still did it... Only after emailing support did it no longer do that. I'm so glad I keep most of my money in cold storage.
@_date: 2015-02-26 06:19:12
Do they even have many users? They got a ton of money, but almost never here of anyone using them. Only reason I have one is since I like to test out new wallets. I'm verified on coinbase, circle, buttercoin etc, and I can't here.. k

Are you using multisig for your hot wallet?
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:01:44
Yes, but when they market themselves without the .info on purpose to take advantage of the term blockchain being thrown around as revolutionary it sort of causes confusion.

Everyone seems to hate Coinbase for going beyond aml kyc, but they're just playing it safe to avoid being shut down. They wouldn't pull stuff I've seen submitted or complained about if they didn't have to.

I second this. They're so sexy, especially in person.
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:28:55
No, if I did that all my friends would have hated me. I've told them about opportunities to get some for free. (coinbase student offer) Other than that I've avoided doing this because it's a bad idea.
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:46:34
Check out the 21 library.. I bet you could do the exact same thing... :-) No need for a dapp. (which is the idea I get whenever someone is building something on ethereum, why?)

I was wondering when this would come through! Sending in usd was way to slow when it took 5 days. Nice to see this happen. This will make it easier to arbitrage and convince more people to wire in money. ;-) I have the option now as I'm in one of those states. You need to first request an increase in the limit. Lowest tier being $50,000-$100,000 and highest $10,000,000 or more.

Coinbase is different. Will the average person know the term in technical terms like we do? I agree with not using the term satoshi. (Vault of Satoshi) And  for Bitcoin wallet too, that should be renamed too or at least have another term in front of it like Mycelium Bitcoin wallet, Breadwallet...

If you have an iPhone download breadwallet and write down the phrase it tells you. Only you will have control in that case. I like coinbase and circle for buying, they're great for that. Just don't keep most of your funds there, in my opinion that just defeats the purpose of bitcoin. :-)
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:54:24
I am not circle jerking. Here's the library I mentioned earlier.  
You can easily set up bitcoin payments programmatically with python.. I can honestly see no point in storing a contract dapp on the blockchain for all nodes to store when you can do this easily on bitcoin. Does your dapp/contract really need to be on everyone's nodes? Sadly that's the idea I get for the most part not always whenI see projects built on ETH.
