Update I dumpt.

I find cb a good choice. Not because it’s my first one for bc but because it’s so damn easy to buy/sell. I know the fees has raised but it’s too hard for a novice like myself to withdraw  everything to a hard wallet etc I’m not good with the tech. Maybe cause it was so easy to create an account is why I’ve never double guessed it as well. just my two cents

I tried selling some bit coin and depositing in my account I’m unsure what this means
@_date: 2019-10-31 02:10:57
It didn’t drop yet IMO.. sold at 10700 waiting for the 7300-7580 and buy in bigger

Tried to sell bitcoin to be deposited into my bank acc in Coinbase, haven’t seen anything  in my bank yet,
@_date: 2019-08-20 19:15:48
Do you think because I bought/sold they won’t be withdrawing from my bank account? I’m tight on money at the moment and really didn’t mean to do this
@_date: 2019-10-05 02:49:54
Just bought another .01 bc!!
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:45:10
Can you tell me if I withdrew more money or I deposited into my account?
