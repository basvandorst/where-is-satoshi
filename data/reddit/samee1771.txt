Rsk is a type of sidechain. Here the info from my steemit blog( yes i know an altcoin site but they're ain't a good decetlzed bitcoin social network yet :(  )
Bitcoin can do smartcontracts! But without the high fees of bitcoins! Say what? How can that be?
Bitcoin can run smart contract/be an assets creator with the use of a sidechain. A sidechain is separate chain that connect with bitcoin's main chain. Thus allowing bitcoin to have an ethereum like system without clogging up the main chain. That rsk.co for you :)
Rsk.co use bitcoin as its currency like how eth use eth as in system currency.
Here how it works:
RSK is a smart contract platform that adds a Turing Complete Virtual Machine — a “world computer” — to Bitcoin. Additionally, RSK achieves 100-300 transactions per second on chain and confirms most payments in less than 20 seconds, while leveraging Bitcoin's proof of work security(merged mining).
But with the Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol (LTCP), RSK will be able to process up to 2000 tps on chain! And once the Lumino Network is deployed over RSK, it will allow up to 20k tps off-chain taking Bitcoin to Visa processing levels.
RSK is a Bitcoin Sidechain — a separate blockchain that carries a "separate token" but is able to exchange tokens back and forth with the main Bitcoin blockchain. Users can move bitcoin to the RSK chain, make use of the converted bitcoin, and then eventually move their tokens back, as bitcoin, to the main blockchain by a 2waypeg(aka making decentralized bitcoin backed tokens) . Summing this paragraph off-rsk.co uses a decentralized process to create bitcoin backed tokens
Here how they peg bitcoin to smart bitcoin. Remember 1 smart bitcoin=1 bitcoin
The 2-Way peg is often said to be a method to transfer BTC into SBTC and vice-versa. In practice, when BTC are exchanged for SBTC, no currency is “transferred” between blockchains. There is no single transaction that does the job. This is because Bitcoin cannot verify the authenticity of balances on another blockchain. When a user intends to convert BTC to SBTC, some BTC are locked in Bitcoin and the same amount of SBTC is unlocked in RSK. When SBTC needs to be converted back into BTC, the SBTC get locked again in RSK and the same amount of BTC are unlocked in the Bitcoin blockchain. A security protocol ensures that the same Bitcoins cannot be unlocked on both blockchains at the same time.
Here how the peg works:
When a Bitcoin user wants to use the 2-Way Peg, he sends a transaction to a multisig wallet whose funds are secured by the Federation. The same public key associated with the source bitcoins in this transaction is used on the RSK chain to store the Smart Bitcoins. This means that the private key that controlled the Bitcoins in the Bitcoin blockchain can be used to control an account on the RSK chain. Although both public and private keys are similar, each blockchain encodes the address in a different format. This means that the addresses on both blockchains are different.
The big problem with side chains right now is it kinda somewhat centralized aka remember me stating the federation?
Do not worry it only temporary!!!!
The RSK platform will be launched with a Federation of well-known and respected community members (blockchain companies with high security standards). Each member is identified by a public key for the block checkpoint signature scheme. The Federation is able to add or remove members using an on-chain voting system. The conditions to become a Federation member (known as Federation Member Requirements or FMR) establish basic security policies and legal requirements that all members must meet.
The Federation will provide several services to the network. Some of them will be available at launch and other will be added later. Each member can choose to provide any of the following services:
Two-way peg with Bitcoin
Checkpointing services
However when Core( i think they will Blockstream is supporting side chains)adds special opcodes or extensibility to validate SPV proofs as a hard-fork, or to manage a drivechain, the Federation role as STTPs in the 2-Way peg will no longer be necessary. Until that happens, we expect the Federation and the sidechain validation to coexist.
And the for the checkpoints
By default, clients stop using federated checkpoints when if RSK hashing power is over 66% of the maximum BTC hashing difficulty observed in the best chain and the fees paid in a block are higher or equal to the average reward of a Bitcoin block. However, any user can re-configure this local policy.
So pretty much for rsk to be decentralized it must have 70% of bitcoin hashpower(luckily 90% has agreed to merge mine it so that part is out of the way) and core adding the protocol for sidechains then the federation will be deactivated
Another very very small "flaw" is that the Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol compresses the data so much it has a small very small 1 out of a million chance to expose identity which is bad for those concerned about privacy. However with a quick sap of adding zk-Snarks the privacy should be completely solved.
This is the future my friends! Rsk.co can scale even further with future scaling solutions.
The main net is out tomorrow!

Segwit removes information that's normally included in a Bitcoin transaction. A block can't actually hold more than 1mb, but holds more txs within that 1 mb cuz txs are smaller. Thus a larger theoretical size...this is why "weight" is used a lot to explain txs in a block Just see the two link above for more info!!!

Got 0.1 btc? we can create make bitcoin legacy with this tool: 
And we need 0.25 btc to list it on some shit exchange

Worse it could be every 5 minutes the blockchain grows 1tb

I was being sarcastic. 
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:03:44
lol the link indeed looks really shady. Almost thought it was a pump and dump group
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:34:34
Nodes do not get paid at all. However nodes given you more control over your bitcoins. Also the lightning network can give a source of income for nodes for they can earn a % of the fees in LN  
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:19:39
Hey they're faster than Coinbase atleast
@_date: 2019-07-27 19:32:01
He means that when bitcoin get "used"  more, they will be backlog. In this backlog you won't be able to use this low fee and expect the same result. You could still do it but that small fee will take you longer to get a conf maybe even a week. Check out Ln while the fees are low :P
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:27:20
The only really noncustodial way I know of earning "interest" is using joinmarket

Then what about counterparty Proof of burn thing?

Can you show/prove how bitcoin is the ULTIMATE FIAT currency. Fiat the word is a decree. Bitcoin does not declare it has any value. Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity. Bitcoin has no gov it is decentralized 
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:59:47
but what about cryptos built on top of bitcoin
such as MaidSafeCoin, Agoras Tokens, Triggers  and Synereo and the future ones rsk.co ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:14:03
Bitcoin is not fiat. Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity.You might need to use a dictionary before making an argument. 
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:04:18
We are Lolicons now!
Remember nothing wrong with legal lolis....
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:49:48
Well then isn't that a good thing? For small players can compete with the bigger player more? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:55:38
sidechains are the rage for it gives bitcoin an ethereum killer rsk.co without affecting the main chain :) unlike omin protocol which use the bitcoin chain as a sub chain thus clogging the main chain up 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:06:36
So is fiat and bitcoin has a ton of other uses for example rsk.co 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:29:00
The fees in theory could be free. It a free market :) 
Here how it could be free in theory:
How does it make transaction fee free. Lets pretend there are 5 nodes.
1 node say they charge a 0.001 fee
2nd node say 0.0009
3rd nodes says 0.008
4th says .00001
5th says you know what fuck it i hate fees so much i will run a node by myself;donate if you want to help me but i using the lightning channel for myself and help other as a side bonus. ) send bitcoins for free
And that is how you get free free transactions yeah :)
This is super simplified and in an ideal world but you can almost guarantee it be nearly fee :)
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:19:18
Pretty sure they do
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:16:44
or use this service  
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:06:34
While i disagree on the definition of fiat, that explanation is not good
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:15:35
Wrong bitcoin cash 2x. Roger liked the 2x fork as well....
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:18:03
This guy counter his own argument. 
He says fiat is backed by faith and bitcoin the same. 
Next he says United States dollar is backed by the power of the government. 
Another article doing it wrong: 
Link where he gives definition:That was the year that the dollar became a true fiat  currency, not dependent on the market value of an underlying commodity, but  reliant completely on government decree. Then he says bitcoin is fiat. Hmm...
All the articles get the definition of fiat currency wrong. Fiat is faith in the government. They try to use the definition of fiat currency for example this article: 
Until i can find an article where they can back up their claim bitcoin is fiat is wrong 
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:21:33
So i can just print out more bitcoins without changing the code? Math also prevents  corruption in bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:05:54
Bitcoin can gains intrinsic value
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:37:35
The february update will. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:41:09
You know when you do it yourself can you pm the direction i'll run my own node and make my own block explorer :) 
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:04:21
They can't. Instead they're making their own or pumping/using ripple. If they can beat them join them. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:21:52
Well done i'll fork and second making bitcoin 100%  Government-employed developers will be hard. You do not have to use core for nodes.
@_date: 2019-07-27 19:34:10


they seem to be blocking ip address based on twitter tweet I am seeing :(
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:50:02
So what the diff between a segwit address and a bech32 address? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:10:11
Sure but make sure it uses segwit to save on fees 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:11:17
Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity.  
While fait has some value from supply and demand but most of its value is  faith and credit of the economy/government.  
Bitcoin value is from supply and demand and is not created by a government. Bitcoin will also have intrinsic value from smart contract in the form of rsk.co  Thus not fiat
Sources or more evidence: 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:26:53
Then let's bring the  American  and European  "bubble" to the rest of the world :) 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:06:45
Well there is another option:
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:57:59
They have their own currency too but on eth platform so...it not even a sha256 project anymore 
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:37:43
Yeah I know tether run on omni but this one backs it usd peg coin with bitcoins itself.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:16:38
Just barging in but some bcash developers are researching on adding 1 gb blocks.  
@_date: 2018-09-18 19:28:58
Not to the extent of bisq desktop but it can be more decentralized than LocalBitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:52:27
(Facepalm) 
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:46:02
it wouldn't be compatible with the current most used LN atleast for now. They could make it work with BOLT
@_date: 2018-09-23 01:39:02
he could of rebought even more bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:23:55
I say a good date would be bcash change the date day. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:45:34
The lightning network still has to pay bitcoin fees which i like to call finishing fees. So a big block increase would help aid the lightning network by making transaction even cheaper  
@_date: 2018-09-15 16:49:38
I regret thinking bitcoin was a scam pre-2016 :( 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:11:10
Thank you! Finally understand. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:32:43
Yes I am familiar with Meta layers but sidechains give way more freedom than that. 
The offchain tech developed by Blockstream is open source. 
Elements which Liquid runs on is open source:
Elements is released under the terms of the MIT license. See COPYING for more information or see 
Of course I know about those types of swaps:
At this point your sounding like the BCH camp....
And most of bitcoin does not mind bigger  block size limit -the small blocks is a generalization. The better term would be block size delayer. Segwit first then hardfork to bigger size.  
@_date: 2018-09-04 17:40:45
Go ahead-just need to find other users as well
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:39:00
he the same guy/girl saying crypto dead ��‍♂️

But they would their power and influence if we are saying core is in it for themselves only and not the ideals

@_date: 2018-09-12 22:34:06
How is it not misleading? What exchange/service other than them says that?  Plus they know they are calling it that. And if was truly bitcoin core coin-they be listing this: 
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:25:18
They never did say their were  decentralized. Noncustodial yes   censorship-resistant not really for they are a legal company. 
Bisq is indeed better but lacks in key thing that will hopefully get better!
@_date: 2018-09-12 21:40:35
@_date: 2018-09-29 16:54:15
So does the exchange use segwit?
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:19:35
But will do they use segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:11:38

 Why not just use XRB then? Here the answer bc bitcoin has a brand name.

@_date: 2018-09-30 16:04:05
A blockchain needs a consensus. Without Blockchain is just a database that in multiple areas. The blockchain itself doesn't offers resiliency and protection from network failures. Look at Steem,EOS, Verge,or Bitcoin Gold. POW doesn't shut down but does split but that can fixed by just going back to the POW chain. POW is the most tested and secure one of them all. All others such as POS bring back Fed Rerseve like characteristics or even more centralization risks of only coin holders ruling the coin. Again Bitcoin is not a waste on energy. It generates protection and security. POS is just shortcut and not useful in base layer but app layer maybe. Sidechains and mini databases/blockchains can be built on Bitcoin-giving the strength of bitcoin and reusing the energy. It is already built efficient.
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:40:50
I mean using offchain atomic swaps and LN coinjoin then maybe :P
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:03:27
That a sad reason. Bitcoin/Crypto is about being a less corrupt than government issued currency 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:09:48
It a conspiracy theory that core has been ignoring the big block for they want other solution first for if we add big blocks;people won't be worried to find other alternatives.

Technically we doing it to a company. Bitcoin.com should not even list  Btc as Bitcoin core. I don't care if they add other coins. BCH- I know some good people very very few but they know BTC is Bitcoin but think BCH is better. Bitcoin.com is very misleading calling BTC-Bitcoin core. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:33:35
You really should advertise your service more. Never heard of before this reddit post

And how many of them don't have segwit yet? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:41:00
You know i can make that happen what i just need an exchange to support it and boom. This tool should make it easier 
@_date: 2018-09-01 02:23:20
I mean would you like to carry the gold with you? Hence why IOU became popular. There probably way more reasons 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:20:34
Bitcoin right now are an "investment" bc of the f***scaling issue. A couple of years ago you could send bitcoin cheaply less than a penny.
Still bitcoin is not a full investment like a stock here y. 
An investment is where you are kinda limited on what you can use it for. Can you buy a Burger with a amazon stock without dealing with paperwork and shit? In bitcoin use just do it. If the other person want to accept the bitcoin you can send. 
What NardDogAndy is saying is that when you get a bitcoin by the blockchain(offchain is part of the blockchain:lighting network for the win) it yours, When you get a paycheck you have to go to the bank where it stored in the bank and you can get denied. 
Bitcoin is a currency but a decentralized currency that still in beta. 
Bitcoin fees will get cheaper again. bitcoin even can kill ethereum. Rsk is so cool :)  Whether bitcoin does fall(hah never) there are coins who will continue the dream.

Oh no meant other wallets if they respond :P
Sorry about that. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:36:31
Core didn't change the code much-you can still old client from back in the day. The blocksize limit wasn't put by them but they didn't increase it. Plus core does not decide jack shit-who core? Please don't say Blockstream. And increasing the Blocksize limit makes full nodes harder. Plus Segwit was a block increase-just a slower one. If btc becomes popular-LN is here to make btc fees cheap. There schnorr which helps scale bitcoin even more without a blocksize increase 
  
@_date: 2018-09-23 14:20:35

Actually he/she is not wrong, Bitpay and Blockchain are bad actors now. They suck and don't support bitcoin. They might of been good in the past but no more. The past is the past and we are in the present. Bitpay and Blockchain activities are disgusting. And it just not us that share this view.

This rant:


He was pretty biased. I understand he felt like his views of a bigger blocksize limit were not accpeted. I understand that he might not like Core that much. I understand that he believes smaller block suck.   
I would of had more respect if he wrote the thing in a neutral manner and ranted in reddit/twitter on his real views. 
His writing is biased. He clearly does not hide his personal history and brings them out constantly.   
I honestly have no problem with BCH. Just the way some of their supporters act like everyone not on their side is out to get them and/or there promotion of BTC as Bitcoin core. The CSW thing does not give bonus point either... 
I find their bigger block idea fascinating. I more want to see Graphene tested out. If it works out good-it can come to bitcoin :)   
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:38:51
it decide spam bcash with files like the miners giving spam to bitcoin

Been telling them to can't get an answer out of them :( 
but still like the idea of RSK

drivechains should fix the federated part, the 20% fee I heard it temporary 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:45:17
First of all you won't be able to buy burgers with amazon stocks bc you will need paperwork for official transfer. Bitcoin before the scaling issue (now you need to pay huge i mean huge fees) just needed a bitcoin balance(buyer) and the other person bitcoin address\ and boom you can buy a burger. No wait necessary(before scaling issue)  for once sent to the blockchain it can't be recalled. 
Many bank deny wages if for example they find suspicous activity or their closed and you can't claim it(bitcoin never closes) or say the person who gave you the check bounces on it(hate it when that happens) or if the bank can't tell if the person meant to send it to you(you won't have proof but in bitcoin there are nodes recording the transactions).
Bitcoin is not prefect;it still in beta. Bitcoin will lose its volatility more and more people use it. Right now the battle will be making bitcoin ready for the masses before the masses can use it. 
And i do agree that bitcoin could replace the usd as a reserve currency. That way counties can't say that county is becoming rich off of us. Bitcoin is decentralized. It could be the universal measure of value. But right now bitcoin has to scale. I can't explain it to you better(that or maybe bc i am lazy) research bitcoin yourself. See ya :)  
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:17:50

@_date: 2018-09-10 20:13:58
I thought you people were gone-nice to see you back....?
Of course I know of counterparty and omni. But they would never scale unless big blocks were added. And those are bad. Unless they work on making the token move using the LN like RGB is doing. I support sidechains it lets new tech to be made without affecting the bitcoin main net. 
For counterparty/omni to survive it needs to do a sidechain or LN based network.

There are real world example such as a dam being restarted again to mine bitcoins. There no source it just the truth. Bitcoin mining can use green energy if it cheap to. It can move closer to the area compared to other users of energy. It much easier to move bitcoin mining rigs than it is to move banks/gold mines/other users on energy. This post explains most of what u/TheSultanOfSwagger
was trying to say: 
What part what u/TheSultanOfSwagger said is a ridiculous claim?
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:15:30
Well you can use Ethereum code and run it on RSK but having the power and security of bitcoin but with huge scale compared Eth

is bech32 a lighter version of a segwit address?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:52:41
The only pools that may do that are f2pool and slushpool
@_date: 2018-09-30 16:11:34
People would argue those are centralized.  
Life you have to follow the gov way. Or do you mean life as how long you live? It centralized by the way you were built. I mean you follow your DNA code and your protein  and stuff hopefully working together.  
Art? It can fall into centralization. People won't buy it or even ban you to draw it.
 Science? It too can fall into centralization. You have to follow a school of thought. Otherwise you are forced on your own. Much like Bitcoin were you can fork it and be your own.
Philosophy/Culture? It mass rule or even extreme cases decided by rulers. It can also fall into school of thought. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:19:56
Jihan and Roger?  I outta here 
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:38:47
they shouldn't even say BTC is Bitcoin core.

woh that a good app idea
@_date: 2018-09-14 02:00:56
Binance still does not have segwit :(
@_date: 2018-09-30 14:04:04
Never heard of that mixer before...
If you want a decentralized one use zerolink such as Wasabi wallet. 
Or use mixers listed in this site:
They are mostly trustworthy
@_date: 2018-09-14 19:01:45
So does it use Segwit? 
@_date: 2018-09-29 23:22:30
and the modern world ;)
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:54:17
its a small block size increase without a hard fork 
@_date: 2018-09-30 15:40:36
Nice wordplay right there...  I guess you consider everything centralization then? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:31:04
And how would that happen in one day? The only way it will happen is like 50 whales sell their bitcoin for $0.01 Why would they do it;their high and want to lose money. 
People panic, bitcoin goes down but not to 0. It will decline badly but not to 0. IF you want proof lets look at some altcoins, look at paycoin.
Paycoin was a huge scam yet it still has value. Their will need to be a huge i mean huge lose of confidence. 90% whales sell. People sell their bitcoins. But to 0.................? no

I would have donated even if he was a BCH dev, but his post was way to salty/biased at the start. Thank you for the work but no thank you for bringing up politics. 
Edit: What I meant is when Cory Fields posted, he was more neutral. Awemany was not. He did great work but his attitude wasn't the best. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 16:04:32
Cool wallet :)
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:17:30
No the confusing part is that they are trying to say that BTC is Bitcoin core. It can have BCH for all I care but calling Bitcoin core is trying to trick newbies and misleading
@_date: 2018-09-30 14:28:33
Wel'll need a measurement :P
It be like 1/1000  in satoshi in fees
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:45:14
Well it going in one direction after all.........
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:54:36
The ico from my research appears to be a service token: 
Hence another reason why the 20% fee might be only temporary
They did not appear to ICO RSK itself but create a dev token that doesn't affect the sidechain. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:45:54
So bech32 uses segwit transactions and uses even less bytes?   
@_date: 2018-09-01 02:22:47
True but Bitcoin isn't that :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:23:58
The RSK platform will be launched with a Federation of well-known and respected community members (blockchain companies with high security standards). Each member is identified by a public key for the block checkpoint signature scheme. The Federation is able to add or remove members using an on-chain voting system. The conditions to become a Federation member (known as Federation Member Requirements or FMR) establish basic security policies and legal requirements that all members must meet.
The Federation will provide several services to the network. Some of them will be available at launch and other will be added later. Each member can choose to provide any of the following services:
Two-way peg with Bitcoin
Checkpointing services
However when Core( i think they will Blockstream is supporting side chains)adds special opcodes or extensibility to validate SPV proofs as a hard-fork, or to manage a drivechain, the Federation role as STTPs in the 2-Way peg will no longer be necessary. Until that happens, we expect the Federation and the sidechain validation to coexist.
And the for the checkpoints
By default, clients stop using federated checkpoints when if RSK hashing power is over 66% of the maximum BTC hashing difficulty observed in the best chain and the fees paid in a block are higher or equal to the average reward of a Bitcoin block. However, any user can re-configure this local policy.
So pretty much for rsk to be decentralized it must have 70% of bitcoin hashpower(luckily 90% has agreed to merge mine it so that part is out of the way) and core adding the protocol for sidechains then the federation will be deactivated

A opensource link should be in the bottom so people can trust it more but looks like a great tool 
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:46:43
If you plan on using litbox for the current LN-it won't be good.
It wouldn't be compatible with the current most used LN atleast for now. They could make it work with BOLT later on. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:42:54
This is a start? : 
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:16:52
So you saying that BTC should be called Bitcoin core? 
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:44:18
atomic wallet is working on that and submarine swaps kinda do it right now 
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:48:00
Then  is the service for you :) Less than a $100 for a plug and play LN node :)
Coming end of this month or early next month. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 21:29:46
If Mycelium did it was not a public announcement and that people are still asking for segwit from them... 
@_date: 2018-09-27 01:55:49


yes I know-they talk about Q1 in that post as well as the  previous post in depth 
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:55:05
Flypme:  is a good replacement 
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:59:42
probably that no web version is out 
@_date: 2018-09-23 14:36:01
 is one of the best alternatives and if it helps it has no BCH :P 
It probably coming soon though ��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-09-23 14:17:48
If you don't want to run a full node and/or want that fiat conversion:
Here are alternatives:
Globee: 
Opennode: 
@_date: 2018-09-30 14:22:54
That not how it works....
Blockchain were created for money. It known that Blockchains suck at databases. Block chains are basically slow databases but securer and can't be shut down. A combination of Blockchain and databases might work out best. Or using Bitcoin to "power" your "blockchain". Komodo or Veriblock. Bitcoin is not a waste of energy-mining is needed! It the reason why Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 01:36:20
As long as you have the private key. Fractional reserve can still happen to bitcoin as long as you trust people to hold your bitcoin...

@_date: 2018-09-23 23:20:26
Sweet idea! I would recommend you to copy a lot of features patreon has and also maybe support 
So people can use cough dump their altcoins and send them to a bitcoin LN address :)
Also maybe in the bottom like coin dance has list all sponsors-using your service of course ;)
That way the sponsor money can give more money and lower the cost for users/creators :)
Win win :)

no it just how easily the market are manipulated 
@_date: 2018-09-04 17:39:39
I think he is talking about the diff node clients. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 19:51:21
No hence why I said a decentralized shapeshift. Can you set offers in shapeshift? No...
But yeah it super cool :) 
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:45:54
he probably spent most of his money pumping bch 
but is still has some restart it lol
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:47:08
This is a better article: 
@_date: 2018-08-01 00:03:12
Plus from what I read RSK will pay you to run a full node vs Eth 
@_date: 2018-08-25 19:48:32
I won't call it decentralized but more transparent. The trading is basically saying hey let show everyone all the trades so kinda like a public database. What good is that it can't be done on fractional reserve of crypto and you get to who is trading. So while not decentralized it is more transparent and opensource. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:38:46
And the fact is they don't have segwit yet!
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:34:10
 I heard that he makes his own degrees bc he that good
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:11:04
nope they removed that 100K limit
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:46:13
It is but it better than Bitcoin(dot)com just leave a 3-4 star to help alleviate the 1 stars. I don't trust cobra but he so far has no gotten to bad. So happy btcinformation.org exists :)

@_date: 2018-05-15 23:29:10
Wait it working with Samourai Wallet? They are super probitcoin which means that the LN is also coming to there :)
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:52:15
True in both points. Honestly I find a reddit post a way better review for the site then trustpilot. However I guess it the satisfaction that shows bch community that we really are the majority.  
Bitcoin.org ain't bad. Pretty sad with the cobra thing. He did not put any bch references. In fact he is more like to create bitcoin cobra. 
Luckily btcinformation.org gives us a more leverage and backup incase Cobra goes rogue 
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:00:46
yeah but bitcoiners have their own instance and you could run your own server really lightweight and communicate with the bitcoin one 
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:43:04
will support it in the beta i saw the option to add it. 
Maybe this is the first non self hosting one
@_date: 2018-05-26 12:34:02
This is such an old article but yeah btcpay is so cool, LN coming next to it :)
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:15:19
There is nothing different you need to do to use segwit, just use a wallet or service that supports it, for the user it's exactly the same as its always been.
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:10:20
What is segwit 3? 
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:50:44
You should make a segwit coin that way we can tell BCH supporters that segwit coin is a diff coin...
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:38:43
they probably are connected to a bigger pool

It like he did not even read my comment 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:00:08
In time a flexible Asic resistant to Asic can be made plus the large the network gets Vtc the harder the HF. But I guess the younger the coin just keep HF till you can't. And the last day of HF just hope Asic are commoditized by then.

You didn't exactly have to it just they want to see the code bc they are very security focused  
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:37:58
wouldn't they still be custodial and what you are describing is more like instant exchanges like shapeshift. IDK if what you saying exists seem to much of a waste of resources but know anyone? 
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:12:21

however if fees are cheaper the more they can keep. I believe it been shown that exchanges charge higher fees than the network fees to pay for stuff like security.

No but it been here a long time so it has more brand usage. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:02:59
Well it not hiding it and the fact liquid is an alliance of exchanges using a federated chain. It can help lossen the strain on the bitcoin blockchain while the fees for withdrawal also are cheaper.

They do say it modifiable if you buy the license. IDK even most bitcoin wallets collect data which suck. You could try emailing them. I just bite the bullet and run btcpay and don't worry about all of this...

good point and agree that the problem ain't being fixed anytime soon.
I like ipfs but the idea of filecoin would be way to centralized ruining the brand IMO
the protocol like BitTorrent will be diff but the name will be ruined and possibly ruining future aspects of it(IMO).
Great point of RSK, they do say


Wonder if it will come to the cloud storage, would be way awesome if it did, can use sub swaps to connect with the LN :P
but alas I guess I'll have to wait :(  ;)
@_date: 2019-03-30 19:38:39


When do you think LN support would be added? 
@_date: 2019-11-03 18:35:43
I think with Samourai Dojo you can use their coinjoin service more trustless or something? Just know it something to do with their coinjoin thing
@_date: 2018-10-14 23:36:13
I honestly don't know but I do remember seeing that at a time exchanges were like 60-80% of all bitcoin tx as such I(and I think many others) am basing it off that number. I not that much of an expert but will try to find more info on that topic but maybe there isn't way to fully calculate the data  directly... or wasn't done researched before. 
But it is known alot of trades are between exchange to exchange so it alteast save a good amount of block space.  It won't be much benefit to normal users directly-the LN is still the "main" scaling plan but my point still stands it will help traders get cheaper/faster tx. In a way it will help everyone either way. Liquid might be also a good data source-it will show us how many tx are exchange to exchange and give an idea how much of btc tx are just traders. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:19:47
Just see above for explanations on why it doesn't...

Electrum getting LN is so cool :)
We so need more crypto wallets to add LN! 
Bread wallet is finally adding segwit:
hope adding LN doesn't take so long :P
@_date: 2018-10-09 23:57:21
RSK is much more scalable than Eth and most coins but it not the best. I think LN which has infinite scale would be the better option. 
Tokens can be built on top of the LN(see RGB and maybe Counterparty? ) and using a system of risk minimized oracles(or trustless?) smart contracts like features can be made with the LN tokens protocols. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 23:00:19
Ah you mean Mastodon? I see what you mean. 
Also to be fair don't all the node in a system all merge to create one single network? If we use parts of what federation means...
Federation applies to Liquid due to the fact it an alliance between exchanges 
Liquid is semi-centralized to an extent. There no denying that but the risk stated by many are just plain FUD. No fake Bitcoin can be created, anyone can verify the amount. There are risks in the way some exchanges will deny people to cash out the bitcoin however that involves alot of game theory and huge covert operation. 
Liquid federation should be only temporary and is stated to use a trustless peg once it on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 03:07:06
you can't tell it a joke...? The emoji was a huge clue...

A bug in the Bitcoin coding itself creating fake bitcoin? A rollback will be done.

Intersting is/will their be LN support?
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:32:31
When Blockchain.com?
What other wallets have not added segwit yet? 
@_date: 2019-11-03 18:29:58
"technically" 
(pssh: nothing stopping you from using a v p n and using hodlhodl.... plus funds are noncustodial  so your funds will be safe if you record the info ie private keys....
they're officially thinking about coming back next year from what I heard
@_date: 2018-10-02 01:50:23
While TumbleBit is good-zerolink might even be better combine with stuff like Dandelion and Cont transaction it be awesome :) 
@_date: 2018-10-21 21:00:00
There more exchanges that that...
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:23:23
bc it the first step to the bigger goal- trustless sidechains. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 23:18:53
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:02:06
It not an altcoin for it backed 100% by real bitcoins.

From what I got from Magical Crypto friends they monetize by selling security services and boxes to exchanges but I could be wrong it was a long time when I saw it.

Being another coin 
@_date: 2018-10-01 02:47:07
And the nodes of the sidechain-the base layer of bitcoin is safe and not affected :)
@_date: 2018-10-14 18:43:45
I think most of us just saw it useful for it use case but won't be mass used for most individuals users. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 01:45:43
Do you want a trustless or custodial solution?
 
@_date: 2018-10-12 22:52:26
However anyone can verify if there is a peg in Liquid 
@_date: 2018-10-15 22:11:59
Offchain atomic swap are also possible. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 18:52:27
yes I am sure for the adam the ceo of blockstream said the sidechain is not aware of anything. The only fee is the tx fee. To quote adam:
it is an out-of-band subscription paid by exchange-level participants. the sidechain is not aware of it
Blockstream does not control Liquid chain directly at all. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 13:53:14
 under $20 an hour woh man that um a pretty big budget...
Did you mean a month? 
Bc they are plenty of those...

That not bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-10-24 23:40:29
how so?
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:09:54
Anything can be a freaking cartel. 
It not an altcoin for it a bitcoin peg. They can't fake the bitcoin, anyone can look if the peg is right. In fact with drivechain-the federation will be gone. It only temporary. However you look it not an altcoin. At max you can argue it  tokenized bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:00:59
Yes I know but it still backed by bitcoin and you can track the bitcoin created and bitcoin in liquid. No new bitcoin are created nor are any new altcoin created by the two way peg. Liquid is not a altcoin-it is a sidechain that is not as decentralized as bitcoin but it still a blockchain.  
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:51:07
I hope what Brain tweeted was true with LN stuff coming to Openbazaar:  
@_date: 2018-10-18 03:43:53
Atleast BitMex is doing some good with the money they get from rekting people :P ;) 
@_date: 2018-10-12 23:05:26
nope 
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:09:55
No it backed by bitcoin. Liquid gas/tx fee are paid in L-btc which are backed by bitcoin. 1 L btc = 1 btc. That what the double peg system is for. There is no altcoin created by this. You can create altcoin on liquid but you pay tx fee in  L-btc which are bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 03:05:23
Depends on you? 
You just looking for mobile,desktop or hardcore security(costs only $100)? 
@_date: 2018-10-14 18:44:29
The reason people think Bakkt is using Liquid is bc Bakkt works with Blockstream but it never been confirmed what they are using...

IDK for now but I think the first thing should be explaining what the site is about so then people can decide if they want to pay for it.  
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:20:54
The hell man/woman(I don't assume)- it never been fully rejected. Drivechains are just in testnet now. So it still be waiting on if good enough. The community rejected the B which blockstream is part of. Blockstream doesn't control bitcoin! We're not doubting them right now bc they worked on it for it so long. It been battle tested, but we are still keeping watch on them. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 23:55:30
Well token can be built on top of the LN(see RGB and maybe Counterparty? ) and using a system of risk minimized oracles smart contracts like features can be made with LN tokens.  
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:28:43
It would need a soft fork for a peg to be trustlessly made. However the only soft fork that so far is in test net right now is Drivechain and it kinda has issues due to the fact much of it depends on miners to peg it. However it being worked on now so we got to wait and see. 
The federated side chains exist now to be used and test further until a soft fork peg is made. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:30:31
No there more tech than federated sidechain part. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 00:05:51
Ok... Well you heard it now. It new but it been reported by some major outlets:
@_date: 2018-10-01 02:50:52
I hoping it can be improved to lessen those risks but still think it a good idea :) 
the base layer of bitcoin is still safe and not affected
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:44:38
liquid not an altcoin
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:27:20
Well Bitcoin is also still in beta as well technically :P 
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:28:32
No the subscription fees are for the maintenance of the boxes-blockstream made. Blockstream can't monetize the chain directly.
Also drivechains might fix some of the problems you mentioned.
Atleast that what I got from Magical Crypto friends but I could be wrong it was a long time when I saw it.
@_date: 2018-10-14 17:16:30
I can tell the pros and cons of it. But all humans are bias but I'll try to be less...
But first we have to make this clear much of the hate comes from the idea of fraction reserve coming into to bitcoin which is not true...
Liquid can't make  make any fake bitcoins and is not an ico. L-btc are 1:1 pegged to bitcoin. 
* Faster tx for traders
* More space for bitcoin main net thus making tx cheaper for individuals. 
* With less tx on the bitcoin main net blocks on it are smaller. 
* If liquid is done right-removes the problem of a single point of failure and custodial control by individual exchanges of user funds
* Takes money from miners
* Not as decentralized as the bitcoin main net but some could argue due to the fact it used by centralized exchanges it doesn't needed to be...
The rest issues come into play due to belief in what you think which scaling plan is right.
Do you like offchain and not everything needs to be onchain tx? 
Liquid is great. Especially the fact is the federated part is only temporary until a trustless soft fork peg can be made/added. 
Do you think onchain tx are better? This might throw you off...
Ofcouse there is a mix in between...
The next issues comes to conspiracy theories.
Did blockstream block bigger blocks to make Liquid? 
i would say no but other in r/ btc would say yes.
Blockstream doesn't make money on Liquid directly but it does make money selling services on top of liquid like exchange box support,token creation. The sidechain can not be taxed directly and anyone can use it if they that pay the tx fee which goes to the federation...
This is much unbias I can get...
   
@_date: 2018-10-02 01:48:33
yes it their own internal blacklist
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:56:30
shouldn't be 
@_date: 2018-10-07 03:01:08
Well you can create a token system  and more complex smart contracts on LN-so it can happen...
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:15:20
at max he/she can argue it tokenized bitcoins, but it doesn't make it an altcoin either way lol 
@_date: 2018-10-11 18:50:18
I don't support it bc it came from blockstream...
What your point? 
@_date: 2018-10-09 20:02:26
Can you make it so logging is not the first thing I see...?
@_date: 2018-10-09 23:01:22
Well the moment I go to your site all I see is the login page
@_date: 2018-10-25 18:40:03


Using your logic it giving the finger to the government of making exchanges do KYC :P
 
@_date: 2018-10-24 21:38:55
Flypme has no KYC and has segwit support. With plans for LN to be added :) 
@_date: 2018-10-14 17:27:46
I would say that Lbtc are more like Gemini dollars in the way it is pegged to the dollar and do audits to verify it indeed is backed. 
Of course Lbtc are better than that peg but it a much better comparison. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:51:39

and what elavid said :P 
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:20:24
unlike btce-coupons I know for a fact there is something backing it, the question that you have a better claim to is how easily can I withdraw it. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:07:44
unless counterparty turns on smartcontracts again-rsk one of the few other choices :P
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:25:50
Cobra I thought you like assassination markets or atleast was needed? You said that on twitter. Anyway back to the real points: 
Liquid does not require subscription fees to use it. Blockstream sell services and boxes on top of it making money of that. The sidechain is not aware of any fee. It just a blockchain.
@_date: 2018-10-15 22:10:32
That cool but did they even add segwit yet? 
@_date: 2018-10-13 01:06:05
It can only double spend it own tx and forks well it a fork, nodes can switch to the "honest" one 
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:44:24
No it the federation 2 way peg that backs the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 23:58:51
Well those would clog the main net and won't scale as fast bc it would need massive consensus support for changes. RSK would be better but still think LN based tokens would be better :P 
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:29:04
We just go to wait and see
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:43:53
Or they can just fork Liquid and call Masterncard network and it be much more trustworthy than the shit they are trying to do. But they got make us use it lol. I think I'll just stick to the decentralized LN  :) 
In fact the main question is why are they trying to come to Bitcoin? I thought they said Bitcoin was a scam? lol 
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:36:06
Cash app pretty good
@_date: 2018-10-28 20:02:14
lol laundering money bitcoin is terrible for that. 
Of course I'm buying stuff with bitcoin. Also you do know people speculate with fiat as well? 
@_date: 2018-10-04 03:17:11
Cash app is an good alternative but still you got to withdraw for it to be secure :P
@_date: 2018-10-14 23:27:25
Naw-Mycelium  doesn't use segwit yet :( 
@_date: 2018-10-26 03:23:55
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:19:17
it would need to have notice for a hardfork to have consensus but who knows it might be able to be soft forked :P 
@_date: 2018-10-08 17:39:23
Yes there is
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:24:39
Oh cool they planning on doing more stuff with LN :)
@_date: 2019-03-01 02:24:04
Do they do? They never announced that feature yet officially...
@_date: 2018-10-12 23:55:28
That just game theory. There still a choice but game theory makes it so they favor the new system. 
It completely voluntary. Plus it still not known if it can truly save exchanges much money. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 23:23:41
Guess Liquid will also be a way to show how much of bitcoin tx are just traders ;) 
@_date: 2018-10-09 01:00:29
 too
@_date: 2018-10-09 01:00:04
Big reason why it still doesn't have segwit! 
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:42:09
And how do you know that? There are many cases on record of the opposite... 
@_date: 2018-10-12 22:55:06
Blockstream doesn't control the chain nor does it make money directly. In essence Liquid is a masternode blockchain that uses bitcoin as a peg and no token to run expect to be voted in by other members. Blockstream makes money selling services,tools and boxes for Liquid. Anyone can verify the peg so no fake bitcoin can be created. There is indeed centralization and no hiding it  but some part being said are just not true.
@_date: 2018-10-21 23:09:33
Or I'll make one 
@_date: 2018-10-05 01:52:37
Ouch IOS...
There is a good bitcoin wallet that on IOS and has good tech support aka segwit...

Coingate,Globee, Opennode and Btcpay
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:43:22
Exactly no real bitcoiner would use it...
However traders will saving fees and giving more space for us to use kinda... Liquid was built for exchanges not us. LN(not controlled by blockstream) was built for us!  
@_date: 2018-10-14 17:26:01
The 20 companies are the federation which peg the coin. Anyone can run a node and verify the peg. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 23:03:07

@_date: 2018-10-14 02:19:53
Joltfun is the best :) 
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:24:42
nope... it is. A sidechain is a separate chain that uses the main coin as it main currency. Liquid does this. L-btc is the gas/tx fee in Liquid network. It is backed by real bitcoins-you can argue it not the best peg but is still pegged and can be verified by any one. Liquid network is a sidechain! 
@_date: 2018-10-28 16:39:28

You can do atomic swap on the LN 
@_date: 2018-10-09 03:02:03
How much of a dex would it really be if projects still ask to list for it? 
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:30:07
The blockchain can't force you to pay. It more like blockstream services and maybe a fee to become part of the federation? But it more of boxes and services blockstream sells/makes. 
@_date: 2019-11-03 23:32:56
atleast there hope for it to :) 
Could we maybe use something like  decentralized storage on a bitcoin sidechain ie like RSK doing? 
 [ 
But nevertheless so cool!
@_date: 2018-10-09 03:24:29
what it about?
@_date: 2018-10-11 18:48:13
oh you can verify the network your self that the plan. It suppose to come out to everyone(the easy to use nodes,wallets) in end of 2018. The liquid network is out live but it not fully out live yet. The main feature is just out. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:06:01
The link is broken here the working one: 
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:31:49
No traders would love it but true bitcoiners won't use it much. Traders get much cheaper fees with liquid being used
@_date: 2018-10-14 14:36:59
In a way it will for everyone. 
More space is available for users while traders get cheaper and faster txs. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 21:59:42
Could be but it be a drain in battery and make your phone almost unusable 
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:35:32
Many more have been lost or burnt some studies say 4 million bitcoins can never be used again...
The thing is you can also buy decimals of bitcoin which makes up for it. Buy early so you get a whole bitcoin before anyone else and/or just buy as much as you can but store in your own wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-21 23:32:21
Just give me a week or so got to sign up to a bunch of them now just to see it :P

So when will Binance add segwit? 
@_date: 2018-10-08 17:39:02
Satoshi isn't the ceo of btc though. Satoshi "made" and "left" bitcoin(this assumes he/she one person...)
@_date: 2019-11-03 18:34:11
think we can make some sort of social network built on LN like what bcashers have with memocash?
@_date: 2018-06-17 01:07:04
I got a list for you with no KYC
@_date: 2018-10-08 17:53:23

It is but most people don't know it by that name. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:33:57
technically it block weight now
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:12:35
LN smart contracts can be made as well too but not as good as the RSk one. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:31:40
How about this? 
It going to be like a be like $100 
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:54:29
It has LN support jus limited support for LN right now :)

bc XMR is one of the most Bitcoin friendly altcoins? Bc it has better privacy bc of their testing.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:41:30
In steem that not how it works. The diff between steem and bitcoin is in order to get the free transactions you have to lock some of the coins up. This gives you stake aka bandwidth rights to the network. In bitcoin you don't have to that.

Uh, I don't know what your saying but you should look at my steemit account. LOL I know about altcoins. Just bc I lost my first reddit account means I a newbie to crypto world? Let go! Pivx uses Zercoin which has been known to be super buggy and has let coins become instamined many times. Zcash too slow for me to use zk-SNARK but it is getting better. But the Zcash founder reward has left a huge black mark along with Roger Ver being in the team...
You know what you fuck off. I was not being a smug asshole was telling you why Monero was more popular in the Bitcoin community. I know more about coins. I part of diff altcoin subs or their twitter. But I love bitcoin more than all my coins. So FU 
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:34:46
you could use cointippy(supports LN) and tip him on twitter 
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:32:11
Segwit is not needed for say there was something called Flextrans. Anyway Segwit was the most tested,complete solution to transaction malleability. Segwit has been proven to work good. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:36:52
That was totally an accurate statement /s
@_date: 2019-08-01 16:32:59
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:17:35


basically an escrow but for LN tx
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:43:02
You could try  [ for LN tips
@_date: 2018-06-16 17:42:47
bc it claims to = USD a fiat coin...
@_date: 2018-06-18 23:55:49
but rhombuses are not squares ;)
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:59:14
Two diff pokemon LN app the same time...Who will win?
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:45:42
Cough you can use limited LN support for cointippy
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:09:17
Well their goes bcashers $20 Ln opening fee claim...
@_date: 2018-06-09 01:49:49
You should dm the admins then it a flaw in their system bot. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 00:53:16
Why use Digibyte when I can use Nano or Iota and pay no fees at all? Or I can use Bcash and get better liquidity than DIgibyte?
Hell for ease of use let me use steem. No weird address, no fees! What not to love? If your going to talk about how good Digibyte is, your in the wrong sub. Layer two has unlimited scale. On chain has a limit and as such just keep forking to increase.  
@_date: 2018-06-09 03:38:56
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:08:51

yep meant Samourai

Can you please put how much the Ln channel costed to open? I getting tried of seeing the number $20 to open a Ln channel 
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:36:48
I don't own just saying we can use their tech and instead of a token get paid in btc

yet the project is pretty much dead :(

ah ripplecoin oh I mean XRP fanbase lmao
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:44:44
By the looks of it no. 
It more like they connect to miners to host their rigs for them as they get cheaper rates. 
Could be wrong
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:21:59
I am going to tip you once I recharge my LN tipping balance on 
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:21:59
Well that bc they price it like that. You can program it to be priced cheaply
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:47:02
nor as safe with segwit. There is flextrans that one has yet to fully work on...
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:30:29
Times have changed.....
@_date: 2018-06-01 02:27:10
Waves is kinda like a eth type platform 
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:05:06
there are other services that people are providing for fiat conversion
see 
all of which have LN to boot
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:25:47
What platform is it going to use for its token?
@_date: 2019-08-14 00:59:46
Btcpay actually had an option for this,something like connecting a bitcoin exchanges-idk if it easy or not.
There are bitcoin friendly custodial bitcoin fiat conversions:

btcpay-is the best if you can afford your own hosting, btcpay allow you to hold your own keys :P 
But if you want btc to fiat conversions there are:
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:40:14
um that is not true
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:29:07
It a test of the LN plus they don't make much money. They had to program the code and host it so the donations are paying for it. Just enjoy the power of the LN. :)
@_date: 2018-06-30 18:31:57
Let him I would be so happy(that if he has any :P )
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:24:28
You can program your own costs by setting it in the code. Storj is like a decentralized storage platform. Hell you can also fork Maidsafe to create a decentralized hosting and storage platform attach the LN instead of the token part and boom you proved a platform really does not need its own token!   
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:27:19
plus very probitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-09 22:34:44
the plab is/was to make it into a sidechain
@_date: 2018-06-17 01:15:11
Can you fork storj but use bitcoin over the LN instead of a token? That would be so cool. Proving a platform does not need a token. 
Since all storage sellers are on-LN perfect for them!
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:45:49

@_date: 2019-08-04 13:53:00
Look this might hurt, but if you are new use Coinbase(works for most countries)
Cashapp best for US 
 [ for Canada
Here some others(never used them myself or know anyone I trust use it)

Once you learn more, try other ways such as bisq. 
Buying Bitcoin without KYC is hard. The amount of loops you have to go to make it sad. Harder if you are American wish basically blocks you off most places :( 
Not saying can't be done...
Good luck.

They are working on a work round of that. They found an alt solution just need to see how long/safe/easy it is to use.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 01:38:04
Have you never heard about Nick Szabo? He like the father/person who coined smart contracts and came up with Bitgold(never was released)  that later inspired Bitcoin.  Plus he did way more...
@_date: 2018-06-15 20:49:47
Oh I know but LN is not exclusive to bitcoin but anyway here a post on more complex LN smart contracts: 
 
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:41:08
The diff between steem and bitcoin is in order to get the free transactions you have to lock some of the coins up. This gives you stake aka bandwidth rights to the network. In bitcoin you don't have to that.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:35:35
There is a tipping bot called CoinTippy. 
Cointippy is on Reddit, Twitter, Telegram and Twitch and has limited LN support :)

Yeah no...
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:44:43
I don't think they partnered though. For one I think it just Bitrefill using Coinbase api and internal transfer to do this. Nothing on Coinbase other than the funds.

@_date: 2018-06-12 21:45:18
You get to use bitcoin cheaply and maybe in the future earn 
@_date: 2019-10-27 18:08:36
yeah that a pretty good idea or atleast as a placeholder till you get more ideas
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:04:29
This is the news I need. 
Any chance for Channel Factory or Hyperloop to be added or explain like that? 
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:57:02
They have KYC and might be across the whole if Shapeshift was a sign...( [ )
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:27:56
Pretty sure someone is working on that-could be wrong. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:14:36
Look at the good point your mining node is important now according to bcashers. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:59:06


nope trying tell them why it sucks and if they're doing it only to exchange for fiat tell them to use Coingate, Opennode or Globee. If not, BTCpay is the best! :) 
 
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:27:28
Plus I been tweeting/follwing them on Twitter and based on what I see they have found way to bypass BIP 70-their working on adding it to their wallet once it is solid. 
@_date: 2019-06-16 03:02:13
LN would be a cool addition to micerace

Why make a shitcoin?

I respect  Andreas but let not called him that. He doesn't like being called that either.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:01:23
Not really. For one it depends on People to think it is. Much like Bitcoin.
Much of the "intrinsic" value is being replaced for more cheaper alternatives. But jewelry will be a use. 
And the supply in space and in the ocean are more than on Earth. Of course will it happen now? Nope. But if the demand of gold/the tech(which might be coming sooner than we think) gets better, the price will go down due to the inc in supply. I like Gold but don't pain it like that it the best thing in the world. Some things Gold can do and others Bitcoin can do.

@_date: 2019-02-06 00:03:36
I'm confused...
So any bitcoin in that sidechain are burned? 
Is this pretty much proof of burn based sidechain? 
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:08:23
I see.   
Making money off a journalism is hard. With more users adblocking-sponsered content might become more lucrative. LN paywalls anyone :P
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:46:12
Breez wallet is a good option as well. They open a LN channel to you connecting you to their hub which is pretty cool!
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:30:13
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:14:07


You can do the same for other elements/alloyies. Market it the next big thing. 
Ultimately it the network effect and supply and demand that gives SoV value/

I think Blue wallet working on that with there LN marketplace feature. 
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:33:57


Oof I see. Imagine what newbies will do when they other similar named shitcoins.
Update: They fixed it
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:20:01
They made a browser called Dissenter:
 [ 
Right now they're working on making Gab into some type of Mastodan service but they said they're planning on adding LN to Dissenter.
@_date: 2019-02-11 23:36:13
sidechains would be an answer to do that along with third and fourth layers on LN

Yeah they knew it was going to happen but Mastodon allows more flexible to happen. Free speech and a platform to see the dumb idiots are needed. Free speech doesn't mean fear of consequences and having no platform to act of on  consequences is bad.

The  asteroid  has the same Gold as on Earth. Chemically the same.

If they want fiat conversion use coingate/globee/opennode they're so much better and even have LN support :)

wrong some do. Just not major ones yet
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:50:39

@_date: 2018-03-17 12:26:32
No mining won't be profitable but maybe you can get run a masternode or a POS coin. 
But if you want to help bitcoin as well run a bitcoin node using LN. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:50:52
there always sidechains 
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:12:01
kinda, depends on who you talk to. Some people consider tokens cryptocurrency. And token can be securities or utility(or claims to be-the best utility token would be Binance token and even that debatable). 
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:01:05
Although heating houses with miners might be worth it. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 06:00:25
They don't need spokesman  bc that what Bitcoin fans are for...
They are plenty of good articles and videos that explain what segwit is.
Plus the wallets are run and/or have devs as well...
It more of wallets fault,they know what it is, why it good and even say they will support but they just don't make money with it...
Altcoins pay them more(directly/indirectly).
Segwit is growing at an organic rate and will grow
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:54:17
I mean you could but as an adoption metric naw... 
Exchanges will add LN some do already but should not be consider an adoption metric as richyboy says.

By my search RIF:
The RIF Token is intended to be a utility token allowing any token holder to consume most of the services that are compatible with the architecture of and integrated to the RIFOS. Such services may include third party-developed infrastructure services, and any other apps that might be deployed on RSK protocol that agrees to accept RIF Tokens as a means of accessing/consuming the service or app.
The integration with RIFOS will require such service providers to accept RIF Tokens. Having a common consumption token option across all services will benefit developers by simplifying their setup and avoiding distortions around pricing for the multiple infrastructure services that will be required to develop Blockchain-based applications.
The RIFOS may also integrate tools and mechanisms to allow for incentive programmes (think bonus points or loyalty programmes) for companies and developers that choose to allow the consumption of or access to their services through the use of RIF Tokens. Such incentive programmes will be aimed at generating a positive network effect for the use of RIF Tokens within the ecosystem
By the looks of it RIF is some type of token to pay RSK.co for services on RSK chain...
RBTC is still used to pay gas...

Mycellium wallet is still pretty good not the best anymore and just not trustable :(

Just try to avoid them in the first place. Ebang is a pretty decent alternative

The flowers some people sent ��
Also did Roger Ver really send one?

@_date: 2018-11-19 21:28:31
Maybe some in game purchases? It would be pretty good case for the LN and would get more bitcoiners to try out the game. If you want to accept payments using LN-use opennode.co it a good processer that doesn't charge much fee
@_date: 2019-01-19 13:05:31
Never said it was prefect. Just said it was decent lel 
I pretty sure Innosilicon from what I heard isn't bad either. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 00:40:46
They could take a freaking 80% tax but this lost most of my trust... 
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:28:01
got 0.11000 BTC to create it? Using this tool: 
We can create the coin! it costs 0.01 btc
Plus with 0.1 btc to list at yobit 
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:00:19
Wopps mean to say this
send a text to send bitcoin payments over LN using sms.
@_date: 2018-02-28 02:01:53
No i mean do they use bech 32 segwit or the regular segwit?  
@_date: 2019-01-13 12:37:22
Yeah that not coming to Bitcoin anytime soon...
Maybe try with an Altcoin
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:12:47
For withdrawal they apparently use bech32. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:13:24
So when Coinbase adding Batching? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:31:37
Then if you want privacy just enable a vpn. I recommend 
they're the most loyal to bitcoin :)  
@_date: 2019-01-20 23:09:38
Betternet can makes pools much better
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:29:32
I mean Asics are pretty cheap now.   
Use Slushpool by the way :P 
Much better than any most pools(if not the best) 
@_date: 2019-01-10 02:02:22


They officially announced they will add batching and segwit. So far they only made the announcement of Segwit being added but nothing about batching yet. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:37:15
both, true most core dev are unpaid bitcoin is open source, I meant the full time ones are paid below average. But they do have significant bitcoin holding which in a way encourages them to work even harder     
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:31:16
You sure you linked the right twitter account?

@_date: 2018-11-27 05:31:12
It not to stop onchain tx but to lower it. LN will never be as secure as onchain tx. Ok here a bad analogy(late at night for me :P) but think of LN as a customer grade level tx while onchain tx are hard cold military grade level. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 03:01:28
Maybe you missed the part where he writes “Bitcoin Core (BTC)” instead of “Bitcoin (BTC)”, and where he uses a gray logo instead of BTC’s orange logo.

Thanks for your service!

The fact it tracking users makes me fell uneasy...
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:06:56
Are you here because of the money being made in bitcoin or do you believe in bitcoin itself?  That crash will be nothing! Bitcoin will come out stronger than ever! I am not in bitcoin for the  money but the promise of a better future. Plus tether will not crash bitcoin that majorly. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:47:08
That even higher than the moon ;)
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:16:15
um no...Segwit is a 2mb soft fork 
@_date: 2019-01-27 02:09:52
I sure bitcoin core dev will find out some other alternative if needs be. I mean there is extension blocks if a soft fork block size increase is needed
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:19:49
Why does Wasabi not go that route then? Wouldn't it solve the liquidity issue? What are some flaws that make it bad? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:34:17
Still need to add batching through   
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:10:05
You know if you have free time, you should set up a LN invoice which feeds the crickets kinda like the candy dispensers. Would be cool :P 
But anyway wish you luck. Also hope your going to use Slushpool ;)  
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:08:32
Yep, forgot about that definition 
@_date: 2018-11-18 19:21:55
Some questions...
Shouldn't you make https default? 
I guessing you your going to use ads to pay right?
Withdrawl fee? In fact maybe you can use faucethub? That way people may want to use it more bc they can get paid more... I mean i would trust you more if I can withdraw faster...
Anyways, great idea! Maybe you add powerups where people can pay using LN? That would be cool
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:05:49
coinbase will need to batch it payments 
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:29:16
you'll be the miner ;)
@_date: 2019-01-20 23:01:59
On the LN yes. On the onchain part-no. 
It up to you decide if it worth it. 
They're pros and cons. So do your own research. If you plan to store like $5 on the LN part then it should be ok. 
If you want convert your LN btc to onchain bitcoin using blue wallet use Zigzag:
You could refill your wallet same way with altcoins. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:46:03
I not coming back until they add batching 
@_date: 2019-01-18 03:38:50
I think wallets are working on that. I don't think it needs to be added to the bitcoin network directly. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 05:46:03
Oh I think the reason you have to rent is they BLW has its own type of Watchtower service that uses that type of incentive. 
  
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:12:08
Hope your using a segwit provider! Anyways that great to hear :) 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:12:09
Let make into a sidechain! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:17:24
Sure. Why not. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:45:38
add lightning too, you might earn something with LN is more used 
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:05:06
By the looks of it...
They had some type of ICO where users need to buy tokens in order to get the no fees. 
A new tokens are printed to help pay bills with some sort of DOA. 
Sounds really unsustainable and the use of token is ugh... 
 
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:17:23


Wait Schnorr doesn't nead to be added as a soft fork first? 
How does Wasabi use Schnorr before the base layer can? 
Then again I'm don't really understanding how it being added just what it does. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 00:55:17
Only the LN part, it the cost of waiting for more advanced LN features that makes it trustless. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:03:56
Well lightning nodes are onion routed 
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:31:43
The next demand we need to give to coinbase is when batching and bech32? If we do it now it will take maybe coinbase 8 months to add it....
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:05:40
Here a tip bot that still left that uses bitcoin:
It works on Twitter, Reddit, Twitch and Telegram.
It also LN compatible:  
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:09:33


@_date: 2019-01-01 17:41:59


If done it probably be done is a sidechain for mass use. If you want to work on it try building it on [rsk.co]( or liquid. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:54:29
Gemini also supported 2x and does not use segwit yet. Robinhood won't let you withdraw nor deposit(well that part you need to show identity) 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:58:21
So when segwit? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:05:53
Now we need batching 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:13:30
Again it won't affect bitcoin that much and people will being coming out alive from the crash. Every crash makes bitcoin stronger. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:44:28

Binance doesn't even use regular segwit :( 
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:50:00
They apparently use it for withdrawal 
@_date: 2018-02-28 02:07:22
Apparently they have bech32 now too: 
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:20:47
And everyone is African 
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:30:06
So have the come up with a way to use LN?
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:05:25
 Liquid is more for traders in exchanges not that big in my opinion but i'll write about soon :) 
@_date: 2018-02-28 02:07:59
I can't find any info on the subreddit saying that coinbase now uses bech32 segwit just segwit. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:43:28
Love cointippy
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:56:31
Fees would rapidly decrease if coinbase batched their payments. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:15:24
Were you using segwit? It would make the transaction even cheaper 
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:19:07
I hope they actually add batching, would be a quicker update and bring fees even lower
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:58:48
Wait Binance is adding segwit?
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:07:35
all crypto in your coinbase is technically not yours, it owned by coinbase which they delegate it to you.  
Just because you can transfer does not mean you own it. No private keys no crypto. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:12:35
Oh full nodes are important, there are factions in bitcoin so he/she must be a big blocker. 
Here my opinion:
Non-mining full nodes are needed to economically enforce the network rules on miners. Without at least a supermajority of the economy enforcing the rules, miners are de facto free to violate them at will, however they feel is best. You effectively just create the Fed all over again, but with a bunch of wasted energy for no reason. 
That the main one aka i agree with that redditor. 
Here the arguments for it:
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:08:01
But how much of the segwit transactions are using bech32? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:51:31
Not yet. IDK if you really can. Ledger for cold storage, LN is like a hot wallet. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:38:32
More adoption 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:22:23
Yeah Samurai is in alpha. The app has gotten more stable and partnered with Gotenna to send bitcoins through a mesh network. I guess you can say Samurai wallet is loved due to adding new features. 
I use Electrum mostly
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:52:36
It really won't be for exchanges though...
Adoption is more use of the LN aka more payment processor/stores/wallets use LN. 
But yeah exchanges can add LN infact seeing a LN where you use usd to buy btc to transfer but withdraw to the LN would be cool...
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:56:35
Easy fix, tumblebit on LN which is routed on tor
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:36:57
We'll have food that all start with s 
@_date: 2018-11-09 20:55:51
So when do you expect to work on adding LN? If further testing is needed how about making a beta app of the LN portion? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:04:26
New petition time? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:00:14
All crypto in your coinbase is technically not yours. It owned by coinbase which they delegate it to you.  Aka a number on their system. 
Just because you can transfer does not mean you own it. No private keys=no crypto ownership. It permissionless but in theory since they use a centralized ledger to keep record of the data they can deny bitcoin withdrawal. Unless they use a open sidechain ledger to keep track of bitcoin but anyone can see. That be different. Plus the bitcoin main chain is not self aware about sidechain but it will soon. :) Bitcoin is about holding your own money. Owning the private key= owning the crypto 
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:06:18
I found a lightning network guide :)
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:32:07
indeed we do(though could of swore it was more than 50%)
@_date: 2018-11-24 03:00:47
lol nice try. 
Bitcoin is defined by the most hashpower,users and liquidity. 
fyi segwit is a block increase 
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:04:26
Now time for gemni  and other exchanges to add segwit and coinbase to add batching :) 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:28:52
Now we just need a LN text app ie send a text to send bitcoin payments over LN using sms.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:23:50
According this tweet:
It is indeed him and verified. Just for some people who don't want to pay and see.  
Also he did talk about in reddit if you really want to find it(and don't want to pay) :P
But that just his post where he collected his reasons in one post :)
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:11:43
You know what better than doing nothing? Being part of a movement that will change the world!  
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:56:24
Now, it time for us to get them to use batching. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:47:29
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:56:35
Hey that what the lightning network is for :) 
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:20:21
just look at my blog. I have an old account where i lost my password wopps :) so you won't find alot of my good posts :) 
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:36:27
It iffy acutely, robinhood is no better. Robinhood is trying to aviod withdrawls. Gemni is no better it supported 2x and no segwit. Right now bitfyler is looking pretty good. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:17:41
hmm..wouldn't be cheaper/easier just to use a vpn for the bitcoin node compared to Tor. I gave you the tor guide so you can look at it but just food for thought think if you really want to use Tor. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:11:42
Here a cool site: 
It let you maybe earn a little money: 
It a new idea, i going to talk about dev to improve a little wish me luck :)
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:28:27
Nope it not batched, I giving them 3 more weeks so they can announce they batch or it going to be repeatedly asking them on twitter why no batching 
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:06:59
Well the creator of xmr is not  saying it not the next bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:51:14
Cash app lets withdrawals right?  
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:19:51
Segwit save you money. Segwit is an opt in block size increase so using segwit saves you money. Segwit "discounts" transaction by forcing more transaction to come up in one block.  Custom fees can be done with segwit look at samourai wallet the best wallet in bitcoin :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:50:39
On one of my articles i state: a billion transaction a minute
that is the early speed estimate will get faster over time. :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:17:25
but they do not use segwit yet :( 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:55:56
How are they better? Gemini  needs to add segwit and batching 
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:18:24
Now we need coinbase to add batching then use bech32. But batching should be easier to add. :)
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:48:31
couldn't he use a bitcoin mixer along with tumblebit and LN and hide it? 
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:41:15
Please do not use bitpay, crying out loud coinbase is better. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:57:32
The same thing could be said for tether, we just don't know. Unless, they show a cold bitcoin address holding the funds we don't know. They are technically don't have to show/hold a thing. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:47:47
when season 3? ;)
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:54:55
I did say technically not yours. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:00:31
I have posts explaining it. hope it helps.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:47:56
it would save alot of fees:
Blockchain has an excuse for no batching for you have private keys, coinbase hell no. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:57:16
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:38:42
Now time for coinbase-gdax to add batching 
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:39:04


Doing that :) 
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:17:52
Also: 
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:35:49
Nicehash does not use segwit nor do i believe batching
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:28:33
I get it now :) 
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:53:47
Wopps :) 
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:14:56
you never know ;) plus inflation of the usd is increasing so while in purchasing power  might not be the 280 T  in usd bitcoin can reach that. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:54:13
Won't use either, until they add segwit 
@_date: 2018-11-22 21:13:59


does it still use bitpay?
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:18:26
First you must "ally" yourself. What do you think is the best scaling solution? Big blocks or lightning network? If big blocks you are bitcoin cash hence go to the btc reddit, they believe full nodes are not that important  hence you miner nodes only which mean it a ok to do 1 tb blocks. If you support lightning network with smallish block size then bitcoin that developed by bitcoin core. Full nodes are a priority bc they create a stronger network. With them in mind block are small and other scaling such as lightning network are being worked on. Bitcoin's unoffical roadmap is -Lightning network,suh
-Rsk.co=bitcoin's eth on a sidechain
-LN apps
- MAST
- Confidential Transactions
- Signature Aggregation
- Scriptless Scripts
- Simplicity
- Covenants
- Taproot
-schnorr sigs
+ Much much more
Check this site to learn about those scaling solutions and other bitcoin info(it pro-core aka me):
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:45:25
Unfortunately yes. Even a node  is political. 
It quite sad. But  ask yourself what you think is right. That way you understand what going on. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:54:59
robinhood let's no withdrawal 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:45:23
If you read the comment on the issue being discussed  it why coinbase is still charging high bitcoin fees. On reason is because it not your crypto your not in control. Bitcoin is about you owning your own $. Not letting someone else doing it. Look coinbase is an ok company but if there is a decentralized alternative that is the best option.   
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:26:24
love it :)
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:07:40
Thanks :) 
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:24:24
Or use tumblebit with LN routed over tor 
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:09:58
Try my site: 
I explain all of those :)

Ouch, i'll find a windows guide then fro you
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:46:38
Vpn= a slave to the provider 
Tor= slow sync time
I prefer tor if you're willing to pay the  extra costs.
Here the best windows guide for tor i found:

Can someone please develop a decentralized social network built on a bitcoin sidechain? Or get minds.com to use rsk.co?
For the bitcoin side chain:
Free hashpower: Merged mining 
Nodes: store data, earn from the built in crypto.
And more on
Or we can ask minds,com to use rsk.co
or make our own minds.com and use rsk.co 
   
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:33:05
Ouch so BCH is the real Bitcoin now! Bitcoin being the most used and most hashpower does not matter. Yeah Bitcoin does not follow the Bitcoin Whitepaper exactly but it enough bc the people wanted it. The original white paper does not define the coin. It the users that do. And why are you bringing about the original LN whitepaper? Just bc some original does not mean it better. 
Since when did r/bitcoin bring original vision in the talks? 
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:39:01
Can you make your token run on a bitcoin platform such as RSK or Liquid?  
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:55:24
40 i think 
@_date: 2018-07-10 20:15:47


lol I remember reading about that shitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-19 15:36:37
How many of them use Bitpay?
@_date: 2019-09-14 18:39:26


LN support?
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:57:27
Bolt allows for atomic swaps and submarine swaps as well. Aka say you have litecoins and send it onchain bc it cheaper and then you trade those litecoins for bitcoin but those bitcoins will be transferred to you by the LN. In a way you could be saying Bolt makes Bitcoin the main coin while other altcoins be used mainly as a way to top off Bitcoin LN channels atleast that what Litecoins aims to do.  
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:27:07
Troll: a person who makes a deliberately offensive or provocative online post.
Hmm... Darn I offended people LOL I guess telling some that they small bags and anti bitcoin  without knowing them is not offending as well. How do you know that? The main subreddit I use is bitcoin. I just followed litecoin today bc they have interesting LN news going on there. Most of my crypto is in bitcoin-you won't get a number but saying how many bitcoin you have can be a hit list above.
 Since when did I try to humiliate his/her views? I countered with more facts then you said lol.  
The fact is that LIT would be a huge switch from all the hard work done with LN already. Atomic swaps already exist with Bolt and the fact LND supports litecoin and bitcoin the same time. And submarine swaps will let you refill your bitcoin Ln channels with other cryptos. The original vision of the creators doesn't matter much...

Make a LN ico bc-bcashers have been saying the LN is the most expensive and longest running ico..

It was also said that Satoshi thought that nodes would only be run on special servers along with the fact a plan to scale just by increasing block size. Satoshi was a great man(or women) but he/she was human. You saying original vision of the LN white paper makes just as much sense as original vision of bitcoin whitepaper.

Nope he owns shitcoin.com which lists bitcoin as bitcoin core. If you look at his site he does tests on each feature. I hope he does it right otherwise he might be just spreading FUD. Maybe with this test we can convince him?
Edit: He updated his site. Maybe it was a joke the whole time or he got convinced by the LN? Who knows.

I am? The main point of this debate/argument was that LIT bc it worked on by the original creator. LIT is not compatible with BOLT the current LN-all that hard work might be restarted the fact that you don't need LIT to include altcoins. Altcoins would just be a way to top a Bitcoin LN channel.

Currently POW is better.
While yes POW does seems like an energy waste it not. This work is necessary to make the chain secure. In POS, the stakers who owns 10% of the supply will mint 10% of the supply, and won't cost them anything much.
In, POW you have to battle against everything. You have to buy new miners to keep up, pay electricity, cool the machines, buy new ones.
Pos makes it so that 51 attacks are harder bc they are little their investments on the line. Pow is somewhat even harsher. Not only will their rewards lower if 51% attack done, the coin down=machines useless. This is amplified by asic machines which effectively locks the minier rig to mine only that coin.
Pow can be improved even more by making useful mining aka finding prime numbers but scaling the blockchain is way more important. 
bitcoin pow is somewhat actually green:
Basically since most energy produced is usually lost( due to the fact energy can't be stored efficiently or storing energy costs more than making more energy itself ) bitcoin mining gives another use for this energy preventing it from being wasted and giving it value. It also will force miners to use renewable resource because nonrenewable resource will keep on getting expensive. In fact here are already solar bitcoin farms. Yes not the best but the stats saying bitcoin mining is completely wasteful is not true.

It better than Bitpay and Blockchain.info/com

Mycelium and Jaxx adding segwit support end of this year.
Electrum has segwit support and is even plannig on adding LN to wallet really soon(end of this year or Q12019)
@_date: 2018-07-10 01:13:30
He also does retweet a bunch of LN supporter. And in his recent comments he mention as a way to advertise and he did updated his site taking out the bitcoin core part, Unsure what to say. Want to think he doing good-only time can tell...

But not to worry us Bitcoiners have our own Litbox coming out: 
I think it officially coming out in September-don't quote me on that lol

Wouldn't recommend anymore to use that especially with their scammy failed ico

Guys you do know what going to happen? He going to do a "review" on Bitcoin or what he called Bitcoin Core.
if you look at his reviews he does he does "tests/goals" on and write about them. I think he doing the same for the LN...
Maybe with this test we can convince him?
 
Edit: He updated his site. Maybe it was a joke the whole time or he got convinced by the LN? Who knows.

You can make your. Lightning farm is for people who want to run a LN  Bolt based Node but don't now how to assemble/program it. The Node is backed by trusted people and it open source as well. 
You can buy a cold storage wallet and that could steal your coins all over it. And I'll buy one just for shits. I already have on LN node but testing this one will be fun.

Not a bad idea but could of been done much better.
Ok if you are interested in doing this:
1. Create(d) an OKCoin account and pass(ed) Level 2 verification;
2. Deposit(ed) a minimum of 100 USD or EUR; and
3. Deposit(ed) or purchase, a minimum of $100 worth of any cryptocurrency supported by OKCoin.
Wait 15 minutes if you are new and then vote.
They claim to  allow fiat and crypto deposits can be withdrawn anytime after voting.
In turn one of your vote will=0.02 btc about $200 per vote

@_date: 2018-04-19 20:44:33
Thanks for the quick answer. I am so sorry you have to witness the people here insulting you, but this is not the whole community-it is just some people who are sour with the fact you have left. Glad your back and can't wait for LN to be used. PS: you should try it now and make it usable now in a risk zone for LN on your site. That would be cool and free testing for you until LN is mass ready :)

So? In ordinary on chain fees are low the need to use segwit is not that much
@_date: 2019-09-18 20:01:44
The best  **alternatives** are the ones that have more features beyond possible than Bitpay.
Btcpay is amazing once you really start getting into bitcoin but not that great for people who want to accept bitcoin but get fiat instead....or want to spend money on hosting....
Opennode is decent alt but idk it really gets much use-good LApp provider...
Coingate/Globee have LN but also way more alts which can interact way more people to use it vs Bitpay
Other than Bitpay exists and thrive bc it was the biggest one and the one many seen when they first paid with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:50:52
tax breaks as well?

There are some LN wallets such as Breez wallets that have a Neutrino aka light client while not as good as a full node it good enough. Breez wallet isn't custodial but still let you receive payments by opening  a LN channel at their own cost.  The reason for such could be due to great PR, they can slowly collect on fees(unlikely but there a maybe to that). Breez wallet is in open beta but they seem to work on only some devices-64 bit andriod(ios is coming soon).
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:06:41

Not really...
In fact I would say LN gets even better with those two. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:08:03
probably the LN option is what being more advertised here
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:18:28

Use Liquid or RSK(when they open up)
@_date: 2018-12-31 20:21:46
Blue wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:23:35
Hmm... I wonder can you mutlisig the LN wallet that way the trust is spread from one person to different people? If it does work, cool. It might or might not be better though. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:05:19
probably allowed due to being LN related which can be used with btc to an extent
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:28:21
well with the LN, it be only like at max 5 seconds to confirm mostly likely way less...

@_date: 2018-12-19 04:45:41
Not a bad idea but not all merchants want to hold crypto..
Opennode converts them to fiat.
Also some merchants don't want to join marketplaces but set up their own store or have their own store and sell other places. 
Opennode is also an Lapp tool. Since they have alot more liquidity it easier for apps to add LN using them. Not bad for right now. When LN matures self hosting will be the best(and I would argue is right now if not for the liquidity issue) :) 
Also when LN on forra? 
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:53:39

Bitcoin is free market after all.
When bitcoin "crashed" there where alot of miners mining making the difficultly to mine higher. It made it not profitable to mine bitcoin(for some). However the built in mechanism of difficultly adjustment adjust(making it easier to mine bitcoins) when miner leave bc of no profits. So keep the mining ecosystem "balance".  When you mine your betting more so on the future prices. Of course you can still make profit if your electricity cost is enough. Also many miner still mining already paid off the rigs and electricity is low enough to make profit. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:04:44


just make one then :P
