you do know that the concept of money is that it is the ONE THING that has no intrinsic value, yet can be exchanged for literally ALL THE THINGS. this, uhm, general token of sorts needs to be rare and unforgeable, and its practical use case as a currency derives from a (perceived) stability, meaning low volatility and a predictable issuance rate.
