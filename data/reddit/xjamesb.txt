Over 90% of people who trade lose money over a year. I am sure that you like me will think that you are in the 10% who won't. I got wiped out pretty quickly. So if you want to trade take 100 dollars and when you have lost it all you will only have paid 100 usd for a valuable life lesson. Most pay more. You can then buy and HODL BTC like seasoned investors.

I am the OP. You make a good point but actually I did not comment on the value of the currency which is not the cause of a bank run. I guess the answer to that in the long run is to hold stablecoins.

You are right of course although I have some hope for Dai.

This is brilliant. I don't understand the economics of mining. What is the lifetime of a rig? Suppose I wanted to use the heat to farm tomatoes, how many years would it last and for how long would it be economic?

It seems to me that this device makes TeraHashes. The challenge is that the cost per TeraHash can be calculated but the income per TeraHash cannot because both the USD price of a BTC and the BTC income is unknown. Although it is possible to hedge BTC price it is not possible to hedge BTC income because we don't know how many other people will operate miners. Is that correct?

Agreed, and full reserve banking makes recessions much worse than they need to be for no benefit.
