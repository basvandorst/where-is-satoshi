This is an interesting article, and I agree that Bitcoin has some amazing benefits: especially the low cost and speed of the transactions. I also think that being able to divide each unit of currency into very small fractions is a great advantage. And its anonimity is amazingly clever, giving it an important property of traditional cash.
But Andreesen doesn't address one aspect of Bitcoin which I believe is a disadvantage: the fact that its supply (the amount circulating or number of 'slots' on the ledger) isn't tied to the performance or needs of the economy. The advantage of modern conventional currencies (in theory anyway) is that the quantity available is carefully controlled by central bankers who adjust it based on what the nation's economy needs at any given point.
On the other hand (please correct me if I'm wrong), Bitcoin's quantity is governed by mathematical algorithms which have no relationship to economic factors such as inflation, unemployment and economic growth. In other words, at some point, a situation might arise where too many (or too few) Bitcoins may be circulating than would ideally suit actual economic circumstances.
I understand that many people (including many Bitcoin supporters) believe that central bankers do not manipulate the supply of conventional currencies based on what the economy needs, but instead based on their own (or their paymasters') political and financial interests. I personally don't believe this is true, but put this objection aside for one moment. Wouldn't we prefer to use a currency whose value (in an ideal world) is determined by real-world economic factors, over a currency whose value is determined by arbitrary mathematical algorithms?
