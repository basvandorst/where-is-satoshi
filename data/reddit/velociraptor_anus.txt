This is accurate. Don't give trading access if you want to err on the side of caution, but I had to out my APIs into my tax software to pull the transaction history.

Bitcoin atms seem like they would significantly benefit from a LN implementation 
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:40:52
The BCH halving will augment the DARI, which is used to calculate the profitability of BCH vs BTC.
Hashpower will move to btc and then BCH will sink to profitable levels again but at a price lower than where it is at now.
Long term perspective 1 year is nothing and I think this statement of yours implies little experience managing projects or investing. 
With that being said, what impact on the DARI do you believe the inevitable early halving will cause? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:40:26
When did either of the two camps ever suggest the creation of 2 altcoins?
I thought it was segwit 2x or BCH. 
Not segwit, segwit2x, and BCH.
Making BCH sort of derailed the segwit2x agreement right? Because the fork happened anyways?
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:45:16
LN already works on the litecoin network. How much time can there really be before we see some implementation and development?
You're taking a short term problem, pretending it will never be solved, and then claiming that same problem as a long term problem.  That's poor argumentation. 
BCH doesn't have a long term working solution. Miners will game the EDA until the halving and then afterwards as well until there are no rewards. Then the small market share does become a big issue because there's no TX fees to justify the mining. 
Fees should be measured in sats per byte.
It's 8 bucks now because the price of the underlying asset upon which the fee is calculated has gone up over 4x this year. It's misleading to use the coffee argument. 
Anyhow, there's economic incentive for LN developers to get a bitcoin solution working. It will come, it's been tested and exists elsewhere; it will exist here too 
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:48:35
This is awesome. I agree with the suggestion to sticky this for a bit.
I never knew how much was packed into this upgrade until it was eloquently explained here. And with external source material as support!

Doesn't BTC have an 8 year history of surviving crashes? Lol
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:02:01
To refute his or her particular point about one crash finally killing it, this argument is valid.
The historical precedent of one crash killing bitcoin doesn't support the idea that another crash will end it. 
It's like running a simulation and yes, if the car crash were something non lethal, the person would survive no matter how many times they were hit in their life. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:59:44
strawman. Gonna tl;dr the rest. You've ignored every point including most notably the accelerated BCH halving. 
"Digital gold" was always a marketing moniker to further adoption by promoting bitcoins ability to serve as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:24:54
My girl got half her ex's 401k in her divorce...shes been hearing me talk about bitcoin for months and finally said yesterday that she wants to roll over a portion of that into a bitcoin IRA.
Mainstream adoption folks, she's a 35 year old mother of 3 from west texas
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:34:59
I got that too....i don't ever recall having a bitmain account anywhere though...
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:01:25
But....didnt the other side fork way early, essentially reneging upon the deal first? 
Segwit2x was good enough for them, and then variable block size was all of a sudden what they wanted. I really got in back when the hype was huge in May and have followed since; it seems like that's how things went.
I just want stability and decent appreciation despite equivalent volatility in the instrument haha. Forking twice when it was supposed to be once brings uncertainty to my investment
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:08:50
What the other dude is saying is that Tim had to hodl through significant losses before experiencing this massive rally 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:11:38
What is the long term viability of BCH though? What's the mining incentive going to be when the block halving comes in December? 
From a stability perspective, critical to investors and mainstream users alike, BCH has no long term viability. Unless they hard fork off the EDA, but that's another set of waiting and uncertainty as well. 
So....your criticisms, while they may be applicable in this very perfect window of time, are more applicable in the long run to BCH.

What you describe would be HOFDL
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:15:25
Your first sentence is false. It's 4 months away, 8 at most. That's less than 1 year before BCH becomes entirely unstable. This is a short term attack to siphon value off of the btc chain. It's not sustainable. 
BCH is already over 1k blocks ahead according to fork.lol 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:57:53
It's just not necessary right now. We can always hardfork to 2x later; let's exhaust the space provided by our soon to be activated Segwit upgrade before creating another coin 
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:59:58
The place where proof of concept is demonstrated is not often the place where mass adoption occurs. Segwit transactions are currently a small portion of the total.
The point isit works, and maybe if litecoin were used a lot of places then there would be more adoption there. But there's no TX backlog, so there's not a lot of pressure to use that function 
It's funny to see you move the goalposts from whether or not it worked to whether or not it's working and in widespread use.
I suspect you'll have another move here on your next post
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:52:44
I can show you segwit transactions already occurring on bitcoin. Oxt.me/charts
You seem to be pretty impatient bro. The code just activated and you're expecting a magical clearing of all backlog.
What's your urge to buy coffee with crypto currency right now? Like, do you run a shop or something?
Do you write code? Honestly. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:10:37
That's ambiguous and uninventive of you to say.
I'm just spitballing here, but if there's a net decrease to overall transaction costs for one party to either run a hub with some of their long posititions (reducing network congestion and reducing the fees for their productive capital) or to participate in a hub (benefiting from the reduced fees afforded by a less congested network thanks to other hub operators), then they will.
Lastly, if they can generate a few amount which is less than the blockchain buy greater than zero, they may do that with their long positions, as the need for the market to transact will provide an incentive to tap what would be a stable source of fees.
Sure, they could make more investing in altcoins, theoretically, but there's more risk there.
In short, I think you're oversimplifying this global market
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:12:08
The economic pressure will be there to dictate it, especially if the network is larger. 
The pressure is there now, I get it, nobody wants to spend 3 bucks to buy a 5 dollar coffee; but I believe we just enacted a solution to alleviate some of the pressure, so let's see how that works and then players in the space can decide whether or not it's worthwhile to fork off some of the btc network value into a separate token.
This will likely happen from closer to the fork date in November anyhow, so I guess this debate is a bit premature.
If LN solutions emerge and prove to be insufficient, then the hardfork will be an obvious solution
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:40:35
Nah; your post history is very specific, recent, and of a particular slant. So it's worth noting.
At any rate, the long term value doesn't go to zero just because of one slow difficulty period. Everyone wanting to dump their coins will eventually dump their coins. 
In the meantime, an inability to process on chain transactions will only increase pressure on LN developers to implement their newly achievable solutions, which could be free to operate with fees lower than on chain fees but higher than zero. The market will negotiate the difference and channel openers in that high fee environment will charge LN fees to cover costs

There were 3 women....and the rest were men right? 
Women are incentivized in the way that they are because both academia and industry have decided that it's worth the incentive to gain the different perspective that women bring to the field.

Math may be universal, but engineering is as much an exercise in visualization as it is an exercise in mathematics....and there's just a chance that, generally speaking, men and women visualize things differently.

As the only member of a 9 person family who even knows what bloatware is, I'm comfortable relying in the anecdotal evidence being provided here by my and the dude to whom you're replying
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:54:06
Why is a larger block size needed right now?
The mempool is clear, fees are low, and segwit adoption is slowly propagating...
@_date: 2017-09-07 01:19:45
Is it really that susceptible? Price and demand rose tremendously during the period about which we are discussing.
Any technological innovation, particularly the revolutionary ones, encounter growing pains. Bitcoin seems to be handling it's growing pains well on this, and I feel like your marginalizing this to make a point, many year track to becoming the decentralized crypto reserve bank / global payment processor.
Lastly, VISA may be less susceptible to DoS, but you give away more privacy and also a more complete control of your funds, which are aspects of the transaction process that are valued by the users of bitcoin.
I sincerely doubt it was one person spamming. The evidence suggests this was potentially a direct collusive effort or an implicitly collusive effort between a few parties. Most industries and power players in any industry or space will face this type of gamesmanship; so it is certainly expected behavior in the world of business and finance.

It does. The whole point of a UASF is to signal to the miners that the users seek a specific set of features.
These users, a target market, have literally been seeking support from everyone in the ecosystem.
Naturally, there's money to be made, so someone will take them up on the offer and support their solution. That is what has happened here, and I see it as the point of the UASF grassroots effort to gain support from sincerely established economic players
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:56:25
