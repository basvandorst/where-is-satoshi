I've added how it works to the main post. Thanks!

Good idea. I had planned doing that for the actual launch but makes more sense to do it now. I have it where it is now just for testing. Thanks for the feedback!

I strongly recommend tracking on my site and on the payment instructions page. Mailing cash is risky, and not just because a postal employee who happens to be on my exact route stumbles across my site.
Without tracking there's nothing I can do unfortunately. I can't even prove you actually mailed the cash and split the loss with you.
I agree this is a concern, but it's solved with tracked envelopes.

Thanks! Just waiting on blockchain to get back online so I can start tipping people for their help...

This is part of my goal! Making it easier for first time bitcoiners to acquire bitcoins without being intimidated by the "commitment" of an exchange. Sometimes people just want a single bitcoin for fun, to have a stake in the game, so to say.

I created this business reddit account to be separate from my main one (anonymity is the game).
Fortunately I am in Canada and Bitcoin is not considered a currency. Therefore I am not a money service business (MSB) and do not have to comply with financial regulations.
I am simply selling digital goods.

Agreed. My idea was to use cash to be anonymous and credit card / western union to receive Bitcoins quickly without having to register for an exchange or link your bank account.

I agree it will be difficult to gain the community's trust, but frankly this idea does not survive more than a couple transactions if I am not honest.
There is much more money to be made providing a real service than there is scamming my first couple customers.
Do you have any suggestions on how I could make the service more trustworthy?

Yes, once you purchase the rate is locked.
Good point on the fees, I will add that section. Thanks!

Thanks for the feedback, I will be sure to look deeper into the implications of Canadian law on this business.

Interesting, I like the simplicity of your site. How do you do this out of the USA without complying with FinCEN?

Good idea. I was thinking of adding a page where people who have completed successful transactions could post a review. My issue with that is:
1. If people want to be anonymous, they will post with fake names 
2. If people are posting with fake names I could just as easily fabricate a bunch of reviews. 
So, even if all the reviews are real, people could see them as even more of a "scam".
I think the benefits outweigh the costs though... Let me know if you have another suggestion on how to track completed orders.

Yes, there is a mark-up on the Bitcoins as there is no other way for me to make money. I feel the margin is fair for people that want ultimate anonymity and also a fast transaction. The business is not sustainable if I don't send out the Bitcoins! The toughest part will be getting the first few customers.
Thanks for the feedback!
