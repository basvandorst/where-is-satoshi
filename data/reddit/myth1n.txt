if you bought 300 dollars worth last week, and its worth 350 this week, and you sell $50 worth of it, you will pay 20% of $50 in capital gains tax. If you sold all 350, you would still pay 20% of $50 in capital gains. Only your gains are taxed, hence the name.

I noticed in my iOS widget Payne, I now have to hit show more for ltc to show up, before it showed ltc btc and eth, now I see btc bch and eth and ltc is hidden until I hit that show more.

Its short term capital gain vs long term capital gain, not marginal income. short term capital gain 20%, long term capital gain (bitcoin held over 1 year) is 15%.

I wonder how many started this way, i remember buying bitcoin when it was around $10-11 per coin, to buy stuff off silk road or the farmers market. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:28:29
In the same breath, if i had sold all my bitcoin a week ago, took the profits i made on that and bought ETH the same day a week ago, i would have almost doubled my profits because eth just went from like 11-12 bucks to 19 bucks in this weeks span. Also anyone know why Eth is going up at the same time as bitcoin?

Serious question, how would you cash that out? I'm guessing no exchange can take on that type of payout, probably some kind of escrow with brokers and wall st type buyers on the other side?

I just think supply is drying up, less and less coins available for sale is going to keep driving the price up until the next big drama, I think the 2x drama wont be big enough to cause a disruption.

I dont know, i think this hype train is going to be going for a little while, maybe up to 5k in the next month. All the splitcoin FUD is over, the next drama will be about 2x, but that one isnt as scary as what already happened over the fork, so i dunno skys the limit. People big and small are getting in now, and feeling FOMO for lower prices and trying to get in while they still can.

Tbf bitcoin used to have change tip until the development on it stopped, there’s nothing wrong with someone writing a new change tip bot to use any crypto they want. Someone should revive changetip, but complaining about the tipper bot is petty, and I’m a btc holder bch dumper.

btc2x should start off at 15% of btc price according to btc futures. The price can either go up or down from there, just depends on what the market decides, you can bet there will be a few people with deep pockets trying to keep the price up/ buy up bitcoin2x. I personally plan on selling as soon as I can / as soon as its safe and there is an easy way to separate out the b2x coin from my btc coin. $900-1100 is what it should trade at off the bat.

I sold about 3.5 total coins at different points this year, bought 3 different classic cars i have always dreamed of, and still have plenty left in btc for the future. I plan on taking out a little here and there as the years pass, otherwise, whats the point?

There is only 1 bitcoin, b2x will be much like bitcoin cash, another alt-coin to the main bitcoin chain, the only difference this time is there is no replay protection. Meaning if you are not very careful after the split and separate your 2x coins from your normal btc, you can lose coins when you move them to another address.

I think since the BU vs bitcoin debate is still hot, the price can come crashing down at any moment. If there is some kind of consensus in the community maybe things can keep going the way it is, but until we handle that other thing, i think the price is a bit unsustainable.
