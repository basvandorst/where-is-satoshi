It's fun and it's exciting but it doesn't mean dick. Stories about increased adoption and new services coming online are what I look for to gauge the progress of bitcoin. Also keep in mind that bitcoin as a currency doesn't get sexy until a fully bitcoin native economy starts to arise. When the friction of moving between bitcoin and fiat is removed then it's moon time.

If it is relegated to a black market currency it will remain a boutique currency. Many people are going to have to make choices to support bitcoin entirely based on principal.  Something I am doing but it will take a lot more of us.  Lucky for use bitcoin has a habit of turning people into libertarians. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:53:03
I think the delineating between a Bitcoin wallet and "pocket money account" is important. Especially from a usability standpoint. You should have some coins directly on you phone for quick purchases so that it is optimized for convenience. And the bulk of coins in some other wallet that is optimized for security. Maybe it's just me but at times it seems like these two things are blended.
@_date: 2015-11-06 17:37:25

He is,  but we're not really talking about him.  We're talking about the risk and impact of governments banning the use of bitcoin to protect the viability of fiat currencies.

@_date: 2015-03-24 19:44:25
I think the comparison you made is inaccurate. It is based on a model where the economies at the endpoints require fiat.   If the economies at the endpoints had a healthy Bitcoin-native economy then the scenario would start end with Bitcoin except for the part where the actors had to go somewhere. They could do it all from their living room. Obviously this is more of a pipedream but it is intended to articulate that the real value proposition of Bitcoin requires people to just buy and self stuff with Bitcoin and cut out fiat.

the cash scenario would require a quick verification mechanism to move them to a personal wallet. Like a one time transfer scenario.

Would it be possible to use work from bitCoin mining as Proof of Worm? Essentially incentivizing people to participate in the network?

I'm on the bus. Searching is too hard when I can just ask the internet machine.
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:15:36
What site? Do you ship to the US?

Thanks for the feedback. CoinBase is way faster to setup than mtGox.

You can make things with gold. You can't make stuff a bitCoin.

If I could cam whore for bitCoins I would  :p
@_date: 2013-08-20 14:49:35
I don't keep my coins in mtGox. I use cold storage for that. But I dis add a bank account and worry about that being compromised.

anyone use 

its is more of an escrow system then a exchnage. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:39:02
me too bro.

I have been buying coins from Coinbase.com for some time now.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:49:23
Cold storage also makes fast sell decisions tough.

Weird. I tried to move 5 coins to an offline wallet and it told me I needed to wait for account verification to complete

Investment in start ups is not a function of monetary policy or law so I thing think that is germane. your comment on the hostility from banks is more interesting in that if you take a sufficiently sinister view of the banking system then one asks the question: Is this a coordinated effort?  But most of the stuff you point out seems to be speculation that is intentional. As in you are speculating that the banking cartel is coordinating with the IRS to keep taxation vague. More over I don't think it is value in that you should just pay 15% capital gains on bit coin. The comment about deposit insurances is odd in that a) owning bitcoins is not a form of deposit b) there I nothing stopping the private market from insuring bitcoin ownership. I am guessing your are referring to FDIC but I would argue that FDIC is not a good thing for the USD or bitcoin. With regard to justice I am not ware of any need for additional laws to protect one from theft of bitcoins or breach of contract. Can you provide an example where arbitration or judicial support was needed and not available?

I'll take a modern decentralized currency that can't be debased over a old-busted fiat system that has been raped for about 100 years.  If you can't see how bitCoin can further your cause you are a dip shit.  You're a purist and that's admirable but the hail marry you are so focused on is a pipe dream.

What he said.If you didn't architect app to leverage cloud based scale out methods it won't help.  Cloud !=  infinite scale awesome-sauce for any app

This is a very good point. Will the Chinese honor US black lists? Do they have an interest in waging war against the US dollar via BitCoin? It currently seems like they do.

Alright pig fucker. Instead of throwing stones and calling everyone in this sub dumb, explain your position and how we are all doomed.
@_date: 2013-09-05 22:28:49
since bitCoin is heavily based on crypto I posted it here....

I use Armory to manage a cold storage wallet for long term storage

you need to pay 
taxes on your capital gains.

Thanks for the info. I'll have to digest it this weekend.
