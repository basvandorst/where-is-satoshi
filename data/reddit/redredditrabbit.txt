Yes and no. But we're not talking investing.
Investing would be purchasing bitcoins and hoping they will increase in value. You're not purchasing bitcoins, you're purchasing a product that promises to generate bitcoins.

Ok, maybe scamming was a strong word. At the very least it's gambling.


So because these are **A**SICs, shouldn't this be considered gambling in a legal sense? Nobody out there is buying an ASIC in order to play a video game or do some calculations on their income taxes, they've buying it specifically hoping to make a profit off of it, but because there is an "uncertain outcome" it would be considered gambling.

Then the company is essentially scamming the consumers.
You're buying a product for $X, expecting that it will return at least $X+1 for you. Meanwhile, the company knows that you're only going to make $Y (with Y&lt;X).
Because if the company actually expected the product to return $X+1 they would, as I said, just turn them on for themselves.

Can someone explain something to me?
I've seen the claims that the ASIC units will be able to pay for themselves over some amount of time.
This means that a company sold a product to a consumer for X dollars. The consumer then turned the product on, and was then able to generate income (income &gt; X + operating cost).
Why on earth doesn't the company making the ASICs just turn them on and run them for themselves?
If option 1 is create the ASIC for $500, then sell the product for $1500, they would make $1000.
Option 2 is produce the ASIC for $500, then turn the ASIC on and earn $1501, they would make $1001.
Assuming the companies are operating to maximize profit, why would these companies ever choose option 1?
