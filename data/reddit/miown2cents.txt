if you can find a wallet.dat before it was encrypted it can be recovered. it worked for me Because I had kept all my old .dat files I tried to rescan it a few times and it came up as encrypted but as a last resort I ran a rescan with that same .dat file on a fresh download and fully synced wallet. And it came back as UNENCRYPTED with all the funds intact. The reason why it worked is Bitcoin when it is loaded loads about 100 address and those are the address it uses unless you tell it to do otherwise and those addresses are in your 1st .dat file so they will be found encrypted or not. I never encrypted my wallet for quite a while after I had mined for a while and had used only very few addresses and those many times each. So when it first checked that wallets.dat everything was unencrypted. this next part is my guess. so even after  it found the same addresses after they were encrypted the wallet and everything in it had been declared at the beginning as unencrypted. It was explained to me By a renowned Cracker who was unable to crack my wallet with the scant info I had given him in the past but he could not explain why the files generated after encryption also came back unencrypted. I was so shocked when it came up unencrypted I typed in as a password.  is it for real. and it was. I tried it twice before on bitcoin-q wallets that had been tried with the rescan command and twice it came back encrypted ONLY on the fresh unused Wallet did it came back as unencrypted 1 more tip if you do download and sync a new wallet  Clone it right away its much faster than downloading the whole thing again.
Good luck to all
