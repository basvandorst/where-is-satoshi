Is this a legit statement or are you being a shit poster?
A lot meaning — a huge portion of this who work in the financial system.

Yeah but amotnof stuff has changed since these crashes and booms, such as greater regulation, futures etfs and more media attention.
The next boom won’t be like the others.

Please stop.

A lot of people understand the banking system. Stop living in a echo chamber.

It’s essentially a clearing house - who the hell is saying they are like banks? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:15:17
It’s not a ‘profit’ until it’s sold, until then it’s just an unrealised gain. You are correct.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:44:30
This is a legit garbage post. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:27:14
This is a lie, I had two go through today without issue. Stop spreading false bs.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:27:37
This is utter horse shit.
That SMH article spawned from FUD being propagated within a closed Facebook group that spiralled sinto some idiot shilling ING bank accounts.
None of what is written here is true at all - bitcoin is not crippling Banks, this would be on the top of any major banks agenda; the money in bitcoin through the Australian network would be fuck all compared to the rest of the world. The banks are used to money sloshing around daily.
Stop posting this trash.

Much of the crisis was due to a lack of transparency and regulation. The rest was human greed and/stupidity.
The same thing can easily happen in the crytpo market, if rumours of people taking out mortgages to buy coins is to be believed.

How would decentralised currency help?

I’m on the page - about 10 people have reported this Halle king. I’ve transferred two bPay payments yesterday to btc, and both have appeared today. No issues or drama at all - this is not affecting everyone and there would obviously be another reason for the rejections triggering. It is irresponsible and down right retarded to assume this is the Big 4 self regulating where funds are sent.
Please have greater due diligence before spreading anecdotal rumours; I’m yet to see any screen shots of this issue happening, or a reply or justification which didn’t make any sense.

All that bling and a crappy phone? 
Not one of us.

This is the post that has made me unsub.
The posts here are not grounded in reality - it’s embarrassing and idiotic.
When Bitcoin finally does ‘take over’, many here won’t be smart enough to do anything about it.
@_date: 2019-03-07 04:05:42
How will it do that?
That doesn’t make any sense.

Blockchain is not just Bitcoin....

I don’t think he knows what banks do...

Well the irs should provide guidance on his gains or losses are calculated.
I know the laws are different everywhere - but I think there is a rule where if bitcoin is used for transactional purposes under a certain amount (10k?) then it’s not treated as an investment.

What like Wikipedia and all the free YouTube videos? 
@_date: 2019-01-18 21:16:33
People who don’t understand the financial system or the service banks provide trying to be witty edgelords.
This is just embarrassing.
@_date: 2019-01-07 03:16:41
Is that an antifa hat in the lady of liberty?
@_date: 2019-01-07 05:48:35
But there is a gain :/
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:03:31
That scale on the right ... makes this misleading for people who aren’t looking at the detail.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:07:04
Sounds like you lost a lot of money this year and are trying to make yourself feel good.
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:44:05
I think you’ve killed any creditability you were trying to build with this silly statement.
@_date: 2018-12-06 08:38:36
Well we do know - they keep records of how much is printed. They also destroy quite a lot every year.
Go to a mint and educate yourself. This just sounds like you think money is some magical fluffy concept.
