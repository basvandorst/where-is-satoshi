What can you do when you submit to the accelerator but transaction are beyond limit?
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:27:37
Really? Mine just says to check my email to login and I never receive an email.

I made my first Bitcoin transaction yesterday and it was never approved. I just re ordered the transaction today and have received zero approvals. I now learned that I could have paid a higher fee to get it approved. What are my options of getting approvals once an order has been placed?

Why is this happening. I've never had this problem before.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:05:18
Ya im pretty pissed. Such a waste of time. This has never happened before. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:34:11
Hmm well I really hope both of our transactions are confirmed soon. You'd think the high fee would process it faster.

Lucky for me my vendor let me pay him through PayPal so I can just wait this bitcoin deal out and have some bitcoins waiting for me eventually

What's your issue? I just bought coins and tried to transfer into another wallet. I have 0 confirmations after 10 minutes. It usually goes through in like 30 seconds.
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:26:14
What can we do to speed up the process. How many confirmations do we need. Isn't it a set fee?
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:28:10
Ya same. It's pissing me off now. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:20:12
Well the damage has already been done.
