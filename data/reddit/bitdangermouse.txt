love it.  if you watch your portfolio screen and send yourself some btc,  you can see the total balance flick up immediately and the chart changes.  that's some super sexy Bitcoin deposits.  I wish btce deposits hit this quickly.

aiming at visa levels is aiming way too low. 
visa is terrible at micropayments. the true currency of the internet would be used for effortless payments for payments only a fraction of a cent.

anxpro.com best liquidity and fastest deposit processing.  only option for bank transfer these days?

all the noise about an alternate fork is absolute dribble.  is Bitcoin a protocol or a single piece of software?  
sometimes in software engineering you have built up entropy that results in a prohibitive cost of change,  and it's more effective to rewrite.  this is one of those cases.  go team!
is anyone going to be in Vegas I'd like to buy you a beer.
