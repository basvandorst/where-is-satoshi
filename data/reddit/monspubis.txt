It's really not about Leah; she's just the idiot puppet swept up in something she doesn't understand and severely miscalculated.
What's a mess here is *Newsweek*. They did NOT have the story they claimed.

Watching these videos yesterday--this is the only bit of information in this whole saga that has given me pause.

Right. But isn't the underlying viewpoint here that the state's influence is unwelcome in any regard? Or is it just unwelcome to the extent of having an unfettered free market with no criminal penalties associated with the conduct of commerce? Or, are the criminal penalties restricted to very particular classes of crimes, e.g. theft? What kinds of theft--property? Livelihood? Privacy? Who makes those rules--a vast judiciary and "regulatory" body (perhaps by another name)? Will it require an enforcement arm to institute its "non-regulatory" criminal statutes?
You see the issue.

I would wager &gt;50% is related to defense agencies or defense activity in general. I'd put it &gt;80% on "fundamental science" work; e.g. things that have no short-term payoffs such that a corporate R&amp;D lab would bother with it.

FotoForensics does not settle the issue. The problem is, this type of proof can be/is made in undergrad dorms, by people decidedly less technologically-savvy than a devoted Bitcoin-er. This is not a high standard of proof.
I'm extremely sympathetic and disposed to believe this, but given recent events, more is absolutely needed--and is unfortunate, because it's an even further privacy violation. This is quite a special situation, however.
Arthur, it would be _very_ helpful to provide an image of yourself and Dorian together, or a video (sigh), or something else. But this isn't and shouldn't be enough.

And I think that's very cool. But the (short) arm of the Singapore law isn't going to be getting back any MtGox assets any time soon. ;)
It's just ridiculous to cry about the FBI like OP; all the exchanges as they exist today need to die and that's the end of it. Even if an exchange were set up in a place where regulation were as hands-off as possible, if Bitcoin gets any serious traction (and it is $Bs now, but that isn't huge in the scheme of things), it couldn't be well-absorbed and would be an enormous drain on the forex reserves of any small country attempting to facilitate the transactions into hard currency. (Let alone the intermediary levies/costs.) And were that country to attempt to make "special arrangements" for forex loans with larger entities (e.g., G8), there'd be a quid pro quo thing. It's the nature of the world.
It's early days. The way out for Bitcoin is to eliminate the need for hard currency (direct transaction, as we're starting to see), or an evolution to a more advanced cryptocurrency model in which this sort of theft is precluded. That's very hand-wavy, but if I had the answer I'd code it today. ;)
To me, the most fascinating part of Bitcoin is eliminating the need for trust as much as possible. It's not complete, but that's the essence of the Bold Experiment. It needs to be advanced. We'll learn what needs to be done through the scams I suppose. MtGox is just the first of many to come.

This is by far the worst interview she's done today. One vacuous logical failure after another; e.g., since she so dutifully covers Wall Streeters who "make far more money than Satoshi", and live in penthouses in Manhattan with bodyguards and doormen and chauffeurs, and have public addresses -- an elderly gentleman living with his elderly mother on a street in Temple City is comparably safe? Really?
Love the spin about "if he'd only talked to me more". Victim-blaming is alive and well.
EDIT: nevermind, this is the worst: [the crack-up]( Good job Bloomberg, feet to the fire. May even start watching Bloomberg!

Well, to be fair, street hustling *is* good journalism. You'd be amazed how many huge stories come from little more than doing the legwork.
What isn't good journalism is unnecessarily exposing sufficient personal details to ruin someone's life. The one thing Mr. Nakamoto clearly wanted was his privacy, and they've taken that away from him forever. You can still make a story of validating an identity while acting cooperatively with your subject's wishes. She would of course plead that *he* wasn't cooperative, but his rebuffs are all the communication you need to know what he wants.
There were so many better ways to handle this. However, this was probably the best way to launch a career into orbit.

Errr, the dogecoin thing seems a little non sequitur to the Charlie Shrem stuff you were responding to. I think with respect to that community, you're being a bit cynical and giving too much faith to the coordination of whatever they do. On the other hand, that people *like you* are in that community for investment purposes and believe/act in accord with the cynical expectations will probably make them come true in due time.
ANYWAY. Charlie Shrem is a joke and a thief, we are in total agreement on that point. The people here embracing him because of his speak-softly presence in this sub (and elsewhere) are a disgrace and/or minors. What he did was a *felony* which cheated everyone whom trusted him--business partners, investors, a willing/duping public. Many gave Shrem a chance, many were harmed, for a very pathetically small amount of money.
"BUT HSBC DID THIS AND THIS AND THIS ZOMG". No one cares. Ted Bundy killed a lot more people than most mass murderers, I don't particularly think there's much value in dwelling on the contrast. A scammer is a scammer and he should be shunned while he "rehabilitates".

There's nothing I see that *disqualifies* that assertion, and that's really what this investigation is about: the lack of disqualification. And that's logically the same thing as 'true', obviously.
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:37:22
Read the criminal complaint. There's quite a lot of very specific detail there--most of it by Shrem himself, who evidently likes to talk.

The fundamental problem with risk/lose, risk/lose, risk/lose -- which seems to be your recent life story -- is that you actually _have nothing to lose_, since you've already lost everything, and you're effectively risking nothing by doubling-down on 0. Claiming in spite of all evidence pointing to the contrary that "I am the prize" (and therefore I've got a replenishing blue chip to put on the table) rings pretty hollow. It's not being brave, it's just being pathetic. If you're consistently failing, maybe it's best to re-evaluate your strategy and/or assumptions about yourself/the world?
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the reason life hasn't showered you with the success/value/riches you think you deserve is... you're not that special. You're practically a Reddit genre.

There's plenty to argue, but it's just not clear to me how a private police force conceptually has anything going for it besides the word "private". And that actual history of private police forces (generally predating modern public ones) is pretty awful.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:59:47
OK, that sounds good, but I'll take that for what it's worth: not a lot.
Look, most all of us are kindly disposed and *want* to believe. Hell, I don't even think the rambling post of was weird either -- it read like your old uncle's rambling email, doubled-down with a dose of nerdiness and indoor-pale complexion. If anything, it was quite authentic-sounding... or quite clever.
But these are extraordinary claims and need more evidence. Anecdote, conjecture, "connecting the dots" -- we know how that went for Newsweek, at least.

While I appreciate the nuanced precision in the language, how does that speak to the underlying philosophy here? As thrown about in this community, "regulation" is not solely shorthand for "financial regulation"--it's a statement of rejection of state interference. You can attempt to constrain the scope of the term however you like, but I have a hard time seeing how protection of property rights isn't a type of regulation.

It's a huge difference, to be sure, and bleeds in the details--but fair enough.
A practical observation: I find it hard to believe a state would accept a petition for redress without imposing its control on the system of exchange. It seems hopelessly naive to imagine a special niche would be carved out for Bitcoin. At the very least you'd be taxed, which means assessed, which means regulated. :p So it's all a bit moot. (Not that you're arguing that.)
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:43:01
I'm sure a private police force at your personal whim would cause no issues whatsoever for society at large, and would achieve an unblemished record of proper restraint and oversight.

It's such an odd thing, that a system built on jettisoning the need for trust could be so often breached by scammers and docile adherents who *want* to trust.
