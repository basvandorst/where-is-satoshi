You have to triple them to escape the underscore so it doesn't italicize the "face"

Read the bit after "with intent to..." again. This is totally fine.

^ this
ETH/ETC forked to roll back a few transactions that people didn't like, but was perfectly "legal" under the existing code. There was a lot of money invested into a thing called DAO, where each person who sent it money was supposed to be able to vote on how that money was spent. One person found a bug in the DAO's code that let them spend money without approval from anyone else. ETC kept that transaction ("code is law, your code had a bug, sucks to be you"), ETH canceled it ("lol nope, we want to keep our money, that's more important than the code").
ETH currently has about 20x higher difficulty than ETC, and 25x higher price.

That's already a thing, just swap out "bitcoin wallet" with "x.509 certificate" and you have an equivalent, but existing solution to the same problem.

I think it relies on QR scanners only looking at the center points of each data block. Zoom in close enough and you can see that the center of each block is not animated, and stays either black or white.

The x.509 certificates used in SSL are not restricted to use in SSL, they're just a commonly used standard for public key encryption, which also already implement important things for use as credentials, like revocation and adding attributes ("when does this cert. expire").

It's not a challenging problem for someone who's decent with image processing - most if not all the QR data is still there, since OP used a type of tool that blended black in with the existing image, instead of a "replace all pixels in this region with this color" tool. I could probably tease out the private key given a few hours, but it's not worth it for $1 USD.
Also, it's funny how people are feeding the troll - if they had the private key they'd sign a message with it. :)
@_date: 2014-08-23 15:28:12
False - you could do the necessary math with pen+paper. Since you only have to transmit the signed transaction you wouldn't reveal the private key by punching the raw transaction into a computer. Obviously you should burn the paper when you're done, if you ever plan on using the address again ;)

What, you think nobody bought at the previous ATH ... plus an x% fee? :P
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:17:39
If you believe in bitcoin, you don't since you'll eventually be able to spend it directly...
But if you're looking to hedge your bets and get a nice USD retirement now, you'd sell off a few million $ over the course of a month or two. Maybe spread across several exchanges.
Exact strategies depend on which way you want to manipulate the market while you're at it.

Well the merchant pays $0.30 + ~3% of txn value (~$0.41 for that $3.74 transaction) with a credit card so maybe wait a little longer to whine about it? Or insist on having the merchant pay your txn fees, same as CCs...
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:37:25
Well that's BS. The original meaning, AFAIK, was "The value of Bitcoin has reached the moon when I can get to the moon with a ticket bought with 1 Bitcoin."

I PM'd him a few minutes before he deleted the post + comments (mods locked it last night, of course, but he deleted the text this morning around 08:15 GMT-0500)

Miners get all the transaction fees, plus they give themselves a certain amount as a reward for finding a block. The current block reward is 12.50000000 BTC. The reward halves after every certain number of blocks.
The reward is how new bitcoins are created, they don't "come from" anywhere.
Miners can do that because a majority of the other miners agree to use the same protocol, which includes the reward.    
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:53:18
With a payoff of...?

Perhaps, if you're only counting individual addresses with &gt;1btc in them.

The classic bubble curve says there will be a bull trap, it'll come back up a bit, then drop back down to "the norm".
I wasn't expecting this bubble to pop until after big blocks actually got implemented ("buy the rumor sell the news" also clearing backlog = lower fees = more liquidity = maybe more people willing to sell).
Nobody can tell the future but I say HODL!

It's almost certainly a part of an automated system. Take a look through the transaction chain (click the input address).

The whole show took place in one solar system, they only traveled between planets and moons; not between stars, never mind different galaxies.

Hints so far:
Not a mudkipz, sloth, cat, dog, giraffe, bear, bull, horse, or turtle
Shorter than a giraffe, but bigger than a cat
Not as domesticated as a dog
Personality similar to a sloth, but has a different diet
Has fur
~~My next guess:[i liek turdls](

I'm in a similar boat, got 25c, was worth about a dollar, now back down to 65c. *munches popcorn*
As for whether or not it's wise to invest... people were saying [this]( was a poor indicator of the current trend, two weeks ago, and yet, here we are!
Personally, I'm not buying in until ~200, which should probably happen some time in the next two or three days, but you really shouldn't take financial advice from some jerk with no qualifications.

From the tip bot? The documentation is [here]( To transfer all the funds from your tip receiving account, you get the address you want to send to (bitcoin addresses start with a 1, my tip address is 1Ehs3KGdjMrL7Yekkt1X27qmJAFpy4R3Km for example), and simply pm the bot "+&lt;insert address here&gt; ALL"
You can also replace ALL with an amount in BTC, USD, or other currency to send the equivalent.

Your estimate for transaction size is off by several orders of magnitude. [A typical transaction]( ^((smallest transaction in the most recent block,  is 224 bytes, minimum.
