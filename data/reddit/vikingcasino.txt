Damn... I'm a sucker for a BIG RED X.
Got me to read through every comment.

Kind of an unwanted tip, no?
The whole point is to keep the balance of 1BTC intact.

Can you share a link?  I'm pretty interested in attempting to get this.

With our bodies. Duh!

Poor mptions.

I'm pretty lazy. I wonder how much they'd charge if I texted them 'Get me a glass of warm milk and tuck me in'.
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:16:55
Hopefully.  Those articles you listed are quite potentially scary.  
I'm looking forward to see how 'psztorc' plans to combat this.

Where is that floating 'R' coming from?

Buyer funded is pretty much DIY (Do it yourself).
This way they don't get in trouble for operating without a money transmitter license and nobody has access to your private keys.
For example Silver Wallets (

Can you please provide an example of how one would carry out a job request using Truthcoin  and how it would work on both sides?

What do nodes exactly do to improve Bitcoin's performance?
Are there any places to see stats on them?
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:34:40
Yes. Usually the provider of the coin will tell you how to properly verify the funds.
A lot are moving towards the 'Buyer-funded' model now however since the FinCen debacle ( and the Coinographic scam (where the operator funding it started stealing the funds he secured).

He got 10 years for Possession intent to supply?  Does this mean he was operating without a bitlicense?

I mispronounce Bitcoin all the time.  It's easy to say, but after speaking about it several times, it gets slightly harder on the tongue.

"The fiat story never has a happy ending. Nobody is going to end (or audit) the Fed, but cryptocurrencies enable us to largely ignore it. That is truly liberating" – David Montgomery
I both like and dislike this quote.

I'm kind of hoping Streamium stays away from this branch.  It has so much more potential than just adult services.
@_date: 2015-05-24 18:59:34
Ugh.  I really hope this isn't true.  Has anyone been able to verify whether or not these supposed dumps are real?

I think even bearish Bitcoiners believe $1,000 is more likely than $100.
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:36:04
I think it's a well deserved rant.
It can possibly limit so many innovative products and services from even getting off the ground all to protect against 'change'.

I have three monitors and I always end up with at least 20 tabs going. :S
It starts on one tab on on monitor and then if something piques my interest, i open up a new tab.  If it's really interesting, I throw it onto a different monitor and I continue the process until it becomes a chaotic mess.  
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:38:01
Haha. Me too. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:24:39
Thanks for sharing this.  
I've been looking for something like this for quite a while.  Am purchasing (by Bitcoin of course) in the next few minutes.

Reminds me of the old days of IRC downloading.  Getting to that 100% after downloading for days.  Makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside :)

The only benefit of using Bitcoin would have been the ability to pretend that someone else had made a profile in your name and that you were unaware.
It's kind of hard to deny it when your Visa is getting charged.

It's going to be pretty hard to get a completely accurate portrayal of true 'hacker' and futurology culture on Cable Tv... but this is the closest thing that I've seen so far and I thoroughly enjoy every episode.
I'm sure that Bitcoin will get thrown around in there at least a few times.

The best way is to buy bitcoin through reputable sellers on LocalBitcoin using the Bank Cash Deposit method.  
You go to their bank.  You don't need to be registered there or even give your name .  You simply give them their bank details, hand them cash, and voila... You're done.
