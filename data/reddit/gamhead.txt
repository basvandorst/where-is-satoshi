How can we talk about the birth of a currency that is also an amazing e-commerce platform with classical theory of the dollar!?

Yeah this is the thing that's bugging me :) 
How are you measuring things?
"mass psychology" - everyones interested but not everyone is sending a photocopy of their passport to exchanges or meeting to buy bitcoins. Market cap seems small still to me. You only get a "vote" on what the price is if you buy/sell
"unsustainable"- thing is China's rich were lapping this stuff up, until their gov told them to ease up. That's just one country. Same thing with Cyprus. Seems like there are loads of rich people around the world who have not yet got involved otherwise individual countries couldnt have this strong an effect

wow holy temporal conflation! surely a bubble is defined by a *prolonged* downturn?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:30:12
How long must price stagnate for this to satisfy your conditions of a "bubble"?
Surely if it shoots off to 2000 this discussion is invalidated?
If price stabilises as it is, the 1month growth is huge.
We'll see, let's revisit in a month!

Im just saying look at the timeseries, April *was* a bubble as it depressed the price for months, however this recovery seems to be happening in days this time. 
National regulation is only going to *not* have an effect when the volumes are much higher, which seems super likely to me given the paltry $10b market cap
I think you're probably right about syntax/apples/oranges, and appreciate you spending the time to expand on your "bubble" definition/observation
It's fun speculating, I got in at $60 for 3% of my savings, and will hold for 2-5yrs whilst watching altcoins closely.

Regulation is a joke as they dont have the budgets to keep up with the instruments and technology being used!
History doesnt really help us here imho

Ok, it's hard to argue with Technical Analysts like you that talk confidently about past events. I can see the graphs, and fully understand the mean reversion that we're seeing, the difference is Im discussing fundamentals and future effects.

Yeah the money is all spent on FinMath R&amp;D in hedgefunds/banks and the Regulators dont have a chance of getting their head around it as it all happens. 
I believe regulation is important for insider trading and other fraud/laundering but in terms of limiting instruments 'touching' "public" money (eg. savings/mortgage) it's difficult since people all want the house before they have the money! Measuring exposure is difficult! 
I dont really get which regulations have helped, they're still closing the barn doors after the horses have bolted..

Any references? I dont really get this and I understand Black Scholes

Volatility existing in an emergent currency is to be expected. 
Im a believer in log normal returns, random walks, and long-tailed distributions, so I see 'bubbles' as a natural expression of volatility
Look at the effect Cyprus' interest, Mt Gox failures, and China interest have had. 'Small' events have large consequences simply because of the lack of depth/liquidity.
This is why it's essential to realise the Bitcoin e-commerce platform is replacing/decentralising:
* Currency Exchange and associated rates, Derivatives and Loans
* Need for merchants to implement e-commerce payments systems and fees
* Ubiquity of the value of and access to money - free from direct manipulation
* Numerous security layers and threats
* Send money like an email
* etc..
This is where the liquidity for the depth and stability will come from
The only threat I see is the potential 'cambrian explosion' of altcoins and a fragmentation of implementations. But seems like merchants/consumers dont really want that unless the gains are huge, and if the demand is there it can be put into Bitcoin mainline code.

Ive spent my life building e-commerce and fx trading systems. You keep referencing the commodities markets, but this ignores the utility value of Bitcoin as an opt-in e-Commerce platform - which is what brings the depth that settles the vol inherent in pure speculation
It's growing exponentially, so it's either going to be smooth hockey-stick or bubbly hockey stick if theres vol. Hocke stick is hockey stick, Im not interested in day-trading but I do believe in a long hold
