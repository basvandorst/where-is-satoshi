No no no, we only allow one entity to do that - the central bank.  All mining income just goes to them.

So what?  This is marketplace messaging - delays don't really matter since people aren't going to be sitting in front of their computer waiting for the message.  This is more like email, which is perfectly fine for a marketplace messaging solution.

"but you can make out much better with a credit card than with Bitcoin if you do pay your bills."
Indeed - I've beaten Bitcoin's 10,000% return by paying my credit cards on time for years!

Easy: Incorporate a bitcoin hedge fund in another state/country, have your NY-based company SELL the bitcoins for dollars to the other entity, then have the other entity hold the coins.  Just dollars moving between states (mainly OUT of NY).

I'm going to shamelessly take credit for implementing this feature.  
Glad at least some people think this is cool.  It took a couple days to get just right, but I think it was worth it.  I learned a lot about bitmessage along the way, and in the end it wasn't too hard to integrate.  I think what took me the longest was the angular.js coding I had to do.
For those that are saying bitmessage is broken, I'd say the volume is too low for it to be a real scaling issue.  It's not going to replace email, but it could serve as the main communication protocol for openbazaar for the forseeable future, and I don't think that would cause any real load issues.
Here's the best part - if you don't like bitmessage, that's fine! Just implement whatever other messaging service you want to use, slap the bitmessage API onto it, mod the code in a couple places, and voila!  I look forward to your solutions, as code speaks much louder than reddit comments.

Yeah up 3,600% in the last 2 years is definitely eclipsed by the ruble's gain in value over that time, along with massive gains in value from holding any fiat currency over that time period.  Should sell BTC for rubles.

The IRS specifies FIFO as the method you should be using:
See Cost Basis.






Point me to where the IRS says you can use LIFO to compute capital gains - I don't think they say that.  I'd rather pay a little more tax now than have to re-file.

I've been waiting for an entity like OpenDNS to actually embrace namecoin.  No more arguing over what TLDs are acceptable - you can make anything you want!  I'd say it's time to start planning for the conversion now, getting support into all the browsers.  Perhaps we could denote the new system in browsers with a new protocol prefix - free:// perhaps?
@_date: 2014-04-30 02:27:32
Oh but we're so counterculture at Dark*, we're not trying to work with the current system, we're trying to remake it.  If you want to buy regular stuff with bitcoin non-anonymously, we won't help you with that.  We just want you to buy things THEY don't want you to have while mixing your transaction up with Bob's contract murder payment - REVOLUTION!

It's called luck - blockchain doesn't measure based on actual hashrate, but on the number of solved blocks in a timeframe.  They claim to currently have 36 PH/s on their front page, and the full network is 84 PH/s, so 42% is more like what it really is.  All pools have spurts of good and bad luck from time to time.

I love this idea - let them do it!  Then, when no one buys it because bitcoin exists, it will show how fiat cryptocurrencies are unable to compete in the free market.  You can't have fiat currency without coercion to use it.

You'd only have to issue a 1099 if you are a business entity issuing him payment.  As a personal taxpayer, you don't have to issue 1099s, just like if he did the work for gold.

If you just use modular arithmetic, you could use ANY die, since a roll of 20 on a D20 could map to 4 because of % 16.  You'd just have to input the number of sides on the die as a parameter.

This from the people who literally stole money from accounts in Cypress.  Have they released a similar report for credit cards?  I'd like to see that.  "Loss caused by giving your private key to literally everyone: HIGH".  Something like this detailing central banking risks in general would be good too.

Until they need something more than the currency (like water).  People would be more prudent with their purchasing, which actually has many benefits over what we have today (forced spending/investment because of sure inflation).  It's stupid to hold fiat because you're going to lose value doing so.  Real currency has been used for thousands of years (precious metal backed), so arguing that no one would spend a real currency is hogwash.

As long as you completely wipe out the OS on the old laptops you have, they should be just fine.  I'd recommend Linux, specifically Ubuntu, and go through the steps of disabling all possible wireless devices by blacklisting the kernel modules (fairly easy - just edit a file).  Once you do this, reboot, and you should be good to go!

As a cointerra customer, I was disappointed that they weren't compensating customers properly for the shortfall in hashrate.  15% off per unit on a future order is complete crap.  They failed to ship 400GH per unit, on $6000 units, so they need to at least give us credit for $1200 per unit on future orders, if not by outright refund, with no per-unit BS.  I'll certainly never order from them after this, so I won't be claiming my 15% refund, and it seems like most people are with me on that front.  IF I ever buy mining equipment again, it will most likely be from KNC.

And pay a bunch of fines for under-withholding.  Don't do it - I've looked into it and it's not worth it unless you can profit above and beyond the fines you'll owe.

If you do that, you'll owe penalties for under-withhodling as well.  If you're under 90% you start paying fines.
