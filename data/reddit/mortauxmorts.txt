I like the metaphorical talk! But all jokes aside, thanks for recommending cryptomaps - it's an interesting concept showing all the sizes (by market capitalization im guessing?) with their relative percentage gains (positive is green and negative gains is red)

Gee wow, thank so much for the detailed list of cryptocurrency stats websites, I've bookmarked this &amp; shared with some curious friend also. 
I'm reviewing each places, and for someone of my skill level, I would say that blockchain.info has data that is easy to read and understand. Also a really like the coinkapp site for comparing how each cryptocurrency is ranking up against bitcoin (the market capitalization dominance ratio). Similarly someone else here suggested traderview for the 'social' side of exchanging stats and trading opinions. I will be using all these sites very often!
Just looked up the "bitcoin mempool size" which is super interesting, because this has a direct impact on the amount of transactions waiting to be confirmed or processed and also on the miner price to include with the transfer.
So is there anywhere to find Lightning Network figures on the actual bitcoin network ?

hey thanks, i'm checking tradingview out now and there's quite a good many statistics that I've never seen before. I'm going research them all and get back to you with question (if you don't mind?). 
I'm curious: what makes you enjoy this bitcoin statistics site over the others out there?

woo lumenkraft! i appreciate all those trading and bitcoin network analysis websites. There's plenty of technical information that I'm really just learning about here. Will be on Wikipedia all night. Which places do you use most, why and for which bitcoin statistics in particular?
