Which is why regulations such as this are important to lead it to becoming accepted as a currency. But nothing makes anyone here happy when the government is involved. You guys only pretend to want something until you get it and then you pretend to want something else.

You're talking to three different people about a Bitcoin order which they surely didn't all take extensive training on as that would be completely ridiculous. You placed an order with Bitcoin which is non-refundable in the form of Bitcoin through many other vendors who accept it. Sounds like you're the type of customer that is extremely difficult because of your impatience and compulsiveness. 
If they could refund your Bitcoin in the form of Bitcoin, think of how bad that would be for business. If the market jumps up, everyone is going to demand a refund as their Bitcoin is now worth more. If the market is down, people will demand cash for their refund.

Transparency is the only real answer that benefits the consumer here. Using a debit card doesn't cost consumers anything. You can have a free bank account with a debit card pretty easily, and if you stay on top of your credit, you can avoid fees.

I've used other betting sites, and yes, I understand where I went wrong. I still stand by the fact that your website was specifically very unclear about it and it wasn't as easy to bet on "to qualify" as it normally would be, almost as if the lacking option was to coerce a person into making a faulty bet. 
The customer service afterwards was atrocious, I had to tweet you guys to get a response, and in doing so I found others had the same issue with both the bet and customer service. I will recommend anyone I come across who is at all interested in a BTC bet site to stay away from yours and will recommend other options. I just think you guys are the worst.

Bitcoin would remain decentralized. I don't want Bitcoin to only be associated as a way of avoiding taxes, so I'm personally okay with regulation in order for it to be taken more seriously as a currency. Might get downvoted for saying so but there it is. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 00:17:03
DPR's crimes don't even compare to money laundering or tax evasion on any scale that I would possibly do it. If I were evading hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of taxes or laundering that much money, I would be deserving of punishment by the laws of places which consider that to be illegal.
Maybe the problem is simply that you think it should be legal to use Bitcoin like cash in a country with taxes without paying them, or avoiding USD taxation by laundering your money. That's a different argument to have than merely regulation.

@_date: 2014-04-28 18:48:12
It's not the same as a company that creates a lawnmower. The demand for a lawnmower exists in its use. The demand for bitcoin simply exists in its value, which is what people are willing to buy and sell it for. If creating a full Bitcoin costs $400, no one is going to continue mining and selling them at $350, they will hold onto them until it is either worth it to sell, or they are in need of money and will sell it at a loss from when they created it. 
If someone is mining Bitcoin for the sake of owning the bitcoin the supply is met with an equal amount of demand and the market isn't effected much at all by that occurrence.

I don't really understand the need for the existence of fees when transferring bitcoin. Isn't the reward for mining a bitcoin just that you now own a bitcoin?

I guess they just wouldn't want to be held accountable for any fraudulent charges you could have made. With banking information, if any legal issues happen they can withhold personal liability for being responsible in case some sort of legal charge-back were required. 
You guys need to understand that they're offering a service that carries a lot of risk.
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:38:41
They would have to overhaul everything. You're suggesting that everyone would be mining one block, but if someone solves the block, it would somehow direct the other miners to mine a new block without them knowing while the winners of the first block seemingly continue mining an already solved block with nothing actually being done. This process would continue until 4 blocks are mined, during which time, one of them would actually be rewarded a block, the other 3 blocks would seemingly disappear. This is an extremely inefficient way to waste a ton of electricity and time.

I think extreme steps should be considered when talking about absolute security and I think it's foolish that so many people laugh off legitimate security flaws as unlikely to happen. If you can't continue a debate over security simply because you put blind faith in the likely-hood of a hacker stealing a wallet with specific methods then you shouldn't be commenting on it with such sarcasm.

I figured it would be and then I just want to know if it's definite that the open source part of the code doesn't have anything added to it in your actual app? Seriously, I understand this is a stupid question, I mostly just get asked things like this a lot when trying to explain bitcoin and I'm kind of abusing your time to get the best possible response to those questions. Definitely not accusing you of anything, I use your app and love the simplicity of it.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:05:57
That seller could download Mycelium and sell them for 5% below market value pretty quickly. I see no reason to think this isn't a huge scam.

Until the vault comes out, which will be soon.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:29:18
Does that mean for certain that the app available for downloads on the droid market can be personally looked into or just the open source code released in a seperate location can be looked into?
Is it absolutely impossible for any code to be inserted into the app up for download without that code also showing up in the open source code?
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:20:09
Yes, the announcement that the results are coming out is spiking the value, but it won't matter once the actual price comes out. If it's above, the market will soar, if it's below, the market will sink. That's all I'm waiting for, the number, stop being such a condescending twat.


If the final bid comes out to be 580, the market will sink. This is my point. Calm down and stop being so rude it's honestly uncalled for.

Can people who keep their money in the form of bitcoin (minus the taxes cashed out) write off any losses of Bitcoin value from the point of receiving payment as tax write-offs they would not then have to pay in income tax?

How could you possibly create a wallet offline and have it be connected to the blockchain? I'm not understanding you.
@_date: 2014-05-06 15:11:55
You can still technically keep your private key on your wallet and not have a backup. Or, if you do have a backup, it could be in iCloud. They probably don't want to leave their cloud vulnerable to the influx of hackers trying to crack any service containing private keys that they can.
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:54:43

Right but how do you know the actual code released for the client doesn't have a piece of code added to it? Just because something is open sourced doesn't mean the code they put up 100% matches the code they release to the public and claim to be using.

This sounds more like you almost lost your job for not doing due diligence. Also, you just *happen* to be a Bitcoin circlejerker who just *happened* to get this assignment? We're supposed to believe you weren't gaga for trying to get an assignment to do research on Bitcoin?

It only works if people keep their money within BitPay though, no? Otherwise it's still an onchain transaction. Also, are you sure Satoshi coined the "onchain" phrase?

Wow, didn't expect the first comment to be so informative, thanks! 
So here's what I gather.
* If the buyer/seller mentions any illicit activity, trading with them is illegal
* If I make more than one transaction I have to start a business to continue operating (?)
* I have to pay taxes on my profits according to the law
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:36:15
It's not about how hard it would be, it's about how easy it would be to take advantage from this from a higher up point of power in this distribution and do something that would go unnoticed if you simply messed with wallets that no one ever accessed on a day the market booms.
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:55:09
Yes, because everyone is going to fork over their paychecks willingly to pay for everything.

Yes and no. With that supply comes demand. There is a demand to keep those Bitcoin, or at least not to sell them for very cheap, as the cost of running devices and electric bills to reach the point of receiving any Bitcoin from mining has become increasingly expensive. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 20:30:15
I think you're just explaining it poorly. The only time money is added or taken away from the pool is if the amount traded for is higher or lower than the previous amount it was traded for.

In your world there would be no punishment for crime.
@_date: 2014-04-21 16:50:36
So whatever investing losses you might have are only deducted from your income, and nothing else? 
So no matter what, if you lose money, you're simply taking away from the amount earned that year and then taxing it from there?
So the only way I could avoid paying income taxes entirely would be if I lost the entire amount I've earned through investments?
Just trying to clarify fully, and I thank you for humoring me!
Another question, assuming all of my statements so far are true, is, could my losses potentially put me into a lower tax bracket where I make even more money on my tax return since I'm put into a lower income bracket now?
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:07:49

Even more interesting would be to see the process of claiming it. I'm assuming they give them each a wallet. But there is probably a record of all of these wallets somewhere. What if someone who's part of the project keeps those records and decides to do malicious things later on?

People invest in all currencies. Bitcoin isn't an exception. My investment is long-term and I'd hope to never have to withdraw for cash and only to buy things that I want when I want with the currency I prefer to use. I welcome whatever investment anyone wants to make, short-term or long-term in hopes that eventually enough people will be invested for the short-term trades to have less of an affect on the currency in general.

That fight should be fought at the levels at which they are committed. I would not consider all taxing as theft, I would consider lying to take money from the government theft. 


You should be fighting for legalization of the drugs you would like to consume and against wars with battles you feel unjustified. You should not be using these points as reason to take down all government as the repercussions of that could be much worse.

Also, where would this keylogging software come from?

Trezor hardware wallets aren't available yet to anyone who hasn't preordered them. What else is there?
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:23:06
I've heard differently. If you buy a Bitcoin and the value goes up before you sell it, you have to pay taxes on the gains as well as receive tax breaks on the losses. Wouldn't the same be true if you received the Bitcoin as income?
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:05:41
What have I said that needed to be cited? Also can't help but notice you still aren't citing that claim. It's okay, honestly, this is how all talks on here end. I'm tired of this subreddit.

From your website:


Well, on your fucking tip card it says it disappears within a month. You should be giving people something they can continue to use for a wallet if they want, not demand they figure out all of Bitcoin and move it into their own wallet and only give information on your own personal app.
@_date: 2014-04-22 13:41:30
Also, now I need to figure this tip thing out because I've received a few randomly before haha.
My biggest problem is I always come here when I'm at work so I'm quick to read and type everything but I'm also trying to look like I'm doing more work than I might actually be doing &gt;.&lt;
I plan on putting a lot of time and effort into all of this very soon, I have some business plans for the community that I think would be beneficial in collaborating with those who are good at what they do in all kinds of fields and bringing them together with a single non-profit aimed at spreading awareness, education, advertising, accounting, and job hunting all-in-one. I've already purchased a web domain and looking at options for an official LLC. Definitely a scatterbrained work in progress at the moment but I'd like to get the ball rolling soon.

In your example, the amount of taxes mitigated from loss of value is 90% of the loss. Is this a random number you picked or is that what would actually be mitigated? 
In an example of $500 income for a week of pay. If someone is paid $500 worth of BTC, and they have to then pay $50 in taxes, let's say by the time they decided to sell the Bitcoin the value has already dropped to $450 (a $50 loss). How much of that loss would be mitigated? I understand this would depend on the actual city/state the payment was processed in?

I thank you a lot for all of this information. These are things that have been puzzling me for a while without anyone really getting to the core of explaining it without just getting frustrated and calling me stupid without actually addressing the question thoroughly. You've done this, but there is still one last thing that bothers me.


Yes, I have to trust the gas station attendant not to steal my credit card information, but I also know that his employer knows his address and social security number and it would be hard for him to run off with it. Not to mention the fact that the credit card company would refund any funds he stole. 
Yes I trust the bank teller not to take my social security number, but, again, all of their information is saved by their employer who would become responsible for paying for whatever damages would come of that person taking my SSN. And again, any funds stolen would be replenished by my bank. 
I'm a big bitcoin advocate, but I'm also a big devil's advocate. I have to be, otherwise I look like an idiot when people ask me similar questions and I don't know how to answer them. 
You're not well-informed enough until you can explain it to an idiot, and in this scenario I'm the idiot and you are certainly well-informed so I thank you for taking the time. I hope to pay it forward and explain when you've explained to me to anyone who I meet with the same types of doubts I had and the interest in being proven otherwise.
Thanks for explaining everything!

This was great advice. You could have sold and bought back in when it was in the $300 range.
*Edit* - Guys, I don't care about hindsight. I don't care if they told him to sell at other prices. I'm simply saying that, had he taken their advice right then and there and taken his money, it would have been a great decision whether or not he planned on reinvesting it later. I don't care if you guys are angry at your parents or friends for always telling you to sell on random spikes. I'm not referring to that. What's so complicated about this?
You guys are reading wayyy to much into what I'm saying here. Gonna go with what said and say there is a lot of post-teenage angst in here.

Couldn't you set it up through coinbase to accept and instantly sell the bitcoins for the USD amount it's currently worth? In which case you would also charge for that amount. If it rises or drops in the few seconds that you tell someone what they owe then that's the difference that would come out of your pocket, but if they're paying directly and instantly then it falls on them to deal with whatever volatility happens in those few seconds.

P.S. If you could make this so that I could actually pick an exchange to follow, I'd love it! Even a separate app since this one is all about the average. I'd pay .99 for it for sure.
Hey, why don't you just add the ability to add those more specified features for .99? And throw ads in! Who needs the BTC donation? I like the idea and am willing to pay for it and/or see ads since it's more of a background app anyway!

That is such a vague statement that everyone here seems to take as some kind of biblical rapture. It doesn't mean Bitcoin will take over, it doesn't mean it will be worth hundreds of thousands, it means it will be "a lot of money" which doesn't mean anything at all and everyone interprets it differently. You can't say anything factual about that statement other than it will *probably* be worth *a lot* or *nothing* . Nothing more than that.
**Edit**: Also, the reason no one respects this subreddit is because you guys downvote logical factual statements unless they cater to the circlejerk that Bitcoin is the end-all-be-all. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:28:49
Right that's my point. Sorry I didn't make that clear. 
So if I receive bitcoin as payment, but the year hasn't ended and I haven't yet paid any taxes, at the end of the year, if the value has dropped past the point that I would have to pay in taxes, could I technically sell the bitcoin without having to pay any income tax at all as the payment was written off as a loss? 
The reason I ask is for the benefit of the bitcoin community to trust bitcoin as payment for their income for a service. If they worry about the price drop, they could understand that they are safe as long as the drop doesn't go below the point that they would already be losing in taxes. It would create incentive to accept the bitcoin payment as any losses of value are protected as a write off up to the point that they would have lost that money anyway, and they could then set-up a selling point to be at the point where the loss in value would surpass the loss that could potentially be paid in taxes.
Sorry if that was a mouthful to make a pretty simple question, am I explaining this properly? My english isn't very good.

Have you used Coinbase? You have to verify your bank and identity in a good couple of ways. What's your point though? Stocks are property and they are considered maintained. 
You talking about how it's not easy to buy stocks is 100% irrelevant to the point which is " if it's a 3rd party, they will maintain it so it's not considered inactive. If it's your own wallet, the government has no way of seizing it. Is English your first language or are you understanding me? :D"

He's saying if you bought on this day. The chart shows that on April 10th of 2013 BTC was around 220-260, then the bubble popped and it dropped. So if you bought before the pop and held onto it, you would still almost double your investment by selling today.

The only way to seize Bitcoin would be if it were part of an organization that had your information you could retrieve to prove ownership.


Aside from the fact this reply didn't make it to the comment it's attempting to argue, the "I don't care" card would be more of a reference to saying they don't care about the argument, whereas mine is being used in the form of saying why I don't mind regulation, which is what the main argument has been the whole time.

99/100 of all people want to use bitcoin? Shit, I should start investing more!
But seriously, you are right that Paypal and bank apps can be used to make payments. I guess the big difference is regulation. Apple doesn't want to be held responsible for being a mediator to the possible purchase of explicit illegal items.
Also, allowing iOS devices to hold wallets may lead to hackers pointing out the vulnerabilities of the operating system, which they probably really don't want to give a reason to do.

The fact that they used a November audit to prove solvency in February is a good point. Do you have a retort or are you just shaming people for logically being skeptical?
Picture 2 years from now. Pretend that Bitstamp did happen to be a long-term scam that had since stolen everything. The quote would go like this

Let's say you buy something for 1 BTC. The company immedietely sells 90% of that BTC. You then want it back 2 days later, and if it's gone up in value, your company now loses the amount of money BTC has gone up in value in order to repurchase and return the Bitcoin.
Now if the market had gone down, they could pay you back in money and it's better for you, which is why they simply can't just make it easy to get returns for purchases made in Bitcoin. If they paid you back in Bitcoin you paid and the market had dropped, they'd be winning, but more likely than not they've already sold the Bitcoin and would have to purchase it back which would still require a fee and just simply a lot of complications for something as simple as a refund in USD for a purchase made in USD without such an extreme volatility.

This is news to me, and the pinnacle of my lack of understanding. If I create a private key offline, how does the blockchain recognize a public key generated by a private key offline? You say if I want to spend the BTC, then I need to sign a transaction using the private key, which I can do offline, but would need to broadcast it online for it to work. So to get any money into my wallet, which I guess is technically the combination of the private and public key, I would need to access the internet. So I can create the wallet offline but it's useless until I link it to the blockchain online.
So I guess it just goes back to my question "How could you possibly create a wallet offline and have it be connected to the blockchain?" and I think the actual answer is; you can't. You can create it offline but it's not connected to the blockchain until you broadcast the creation of it online, correct?

The thing about intrinsic value is, if the bitcoin market crashes tomorrow, you won't be able to buy a $600 laptop for under one bitcoin like you can today. The fact that you can right now doesn't give it intrinsic value as you're simply paying exactly what it's worth on the market at any given moment.

Here I'll go ahead to respond to your comment in detail and be done with it as you are an irrational human being.


You stated in your first comment "It was an obvious heart string to pluck at I admit. But it does make one thing clear. What we're doing and what the regulatory bodies are busy with are fundamentally opposed to each other."
I then asked you to be more specific and said "What are you doing?"
You said "Mined it, bought it, promoted it and organized meet ups. Most of these things when people had very little faith in it."
I asked you "So how do the regulatory bodies go against mining, buying, promoting, and organizing meetups for Bitcoin?"
You said "Almost all those activities would require massive regulatory compliance and bonding."
So I ask you how does regulation *go against* mining, buying, promoting, or organizing meetups for Bitcoin? It doesn't. It will be associated with some of that, the taxation of goods purchased with Bitcoin or profits in USD made with Bitcoin, but it has nothing to do with you promoting Bitcoin or organizing meetups. You were told this by someone else as well and that argument ended with you taking a jab at his username and nothing else. 
I'll leave everyone else with a video of your hideous self saying even dumber shit somehow than you're already spewing here: 
@_date: 2014-07-19 00:32:38

Then your argument isn't with Bitcoin, it's with taxation. I hope you can understand that I am not arguing that. Regulation of Bitcoin is fine, and your battle should be fought with the government over taxation, which you would lose as this country runs on it, and always has.

If a block is solved, how would they calculate who the second, 3rd, or 4th person to solve the block would have been? The next highest hashrate?
Also, once a block is solved, the following groups to solve it can simply copy the first. Very half-assed solution you're attempting.

I guess you never took a beginner stockmarket course then, as you can't answer it.
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:20:31
Wouldn't the group who solved it be notified that they solved it so they don't keep mining for the same block they already solved? If not, that sounds like an expensive change to make since lots of people would be working towards nothingness, and then likely not be rewarded even though they solved something first.

@_date: 2014-07-02 17:08:20
I'm pretty against trust-building but that seems fair I suppose. I honestly just have a hard time putting any trust into anything that could eventually just be changed by some random malicious attempt. It's not a trust thing, because I could trust you and you could screw something up and someone could hack into it, pretend to be you, and insert code without you realizing it. 
It's not to say anything like this is at all likely to happen. It's just, if I were to run a business using a service simply out of trust without a full understanding of absolute security I would be putting that company at the mercy of the software.

All currencies are volatile in their early stages, and with volatility comes a harsher approach to transactions such as returns.

I guess what worries me the most is that you're saying I have to trust someone. All the bitcoin community has shown me is that if you rely, at all, on trust, you're eventually going to get fucked over by someone. 
It's not a research thing. The more I read into it, including what you just told me, the more reluctant I am in understanding how I'm supposed to trust people with a system worth billions of dollars to not eventually try to exploit it.


What I take away from this is simply that if the devs in charge of Blockchain did decide to just pull a fast one and work together to change the code in a way to start seeing private keys as they are generated on Blockchain.info, they could do this.

How does receiving Bitcoin in exchange for a service, such as a full time job, work? Are 0 taxes paid until the bitcoin are exchanged for cash or are there automatic taxes in place for whatever the current value of bitcoin is at the point of receiving the funds?

Original post is golded and top comment reply. Post is screenshotted and top submission on r/bitcoin of the day. That post is then tweeted, and the tweet is posted to reddit as the top submission of the day on r/bitcoin.

Silk Road is the farthest thing from helping the technology to succeed. It's always brought up as a stain on bitcoin's record. The best thing for this cause is for you to not be involved at all because you are atrocious at actually trying to help a cause be taken seriously. You come across as an ignorant little brat child with no education and a high sense of entitlement.
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:46:13
Yes, yes it is. The market value is the market value. If they sold on the market, the market value would have gone down, but if they sold at or below the market value OFF THE MARKET, then they sold at or below market value off the market and it's as simple as that. It's just the proper terminology. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:46:49
Careful with that. Suggesting that the auctioned value might have been below market value can get you shot on this subreddit.

I don't know what you mean about this making it rain Bitcoins. Presumably, the coins will sell for under market value. Not knowing how much, the only two possibilities are 
1) The buyer keeps the coins, doing nothing to the market.
2) The buyer sells the coins, plummeting the market to roughly not much higher than whatever the coins were bought at. 
Either way I don't see this relating to a spike in Bitcoin prices. Any spike would be unrelated, no?

I'd add more than a graph for a dollar, to be honest. If all you added was a graph and charged a dollar, I'd probably go ahead and uninstall and stop telling people about it. If you're going to charge, add a few features. Add notifications for price changes above or below customized levels, the option to choose an exchange to watch, and the option to alternate through exchanges. Then charge a dollar. Don't turn into EA lol
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:16:52
What's the difference between the safety of keeping funds in an exchange such as MtGox in comparison to the safety of crating a wallet on Blockchain.info?
I guess what I mean to ask is, is there any way possible that the Blockchain.info devs would be able to have access to a list of privat ekeys that have been created on the website, or even potentially crate a change that goes unnoticed where the private keys generated are also recorded somewhere so that someone else could have access to people's private wallets?
The same goes for other websites where you can create private wallets from.

I'm understanding why certain techies don't trust bitcoin. Seriously though, you're worthless in this conversation and have nothing positive to contribute other than "keep your shit updated" please...seriously, fuck off.

How fucking worthless is your input that all you have to say is update your security?
I have a real wallet with real money in it and I'm supposed to believe bitcoin is safer than that? There have been plenty of useful comments in this thread, none of which came from you. You're captain obvious.

Some, not all. You can have brokerages for long term holdings which don't require this.
By the way, the government gives these back when claimed if they do end up seizing anything, which is rare for long term holdings unless you are a felon, in which case you may not get them back if said property was part of the felony.

If you have to ask, you shouldn't be touching mining with a 10-foot-pole. Most people who mine shouldn't be doing it and aren't profiting. Even if they do eventually profit with a spike in the price of Bitcoin, their profit would likely have been much greater had they simply purchased the bitcoin with the investment instead of purchasing equipment.

Well there are more terms in economics than just "bubble". For instance, the current price drop is due to the freezing banks in China threat for April 15th. So yes, Bitcoin will be sold, and the price can drop rapidly, that doesn't necessarily imply "Bubble". The bubble popping was more at the time when it jumped over a thousand and people were buying Bitcoin left and right before understanding it and the burst was due to the MtGox scandal. 
I guess you're oversimplifying it which might lead to ignorance on both sides, would be the only point I'd make.
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:29:35


Okay let's go over why this is stupid. 


Sure, that's fair, this doesn't actually answer anything that I had said since I merely mentioned "In your world [of anarchy] there would be no punishment for crime" You merely divert to talk about crimes that go unpunished today. Great. Those crimes would continue to go unpunished in a world of anarchy.


So all tax is theft in your eyes. I won't argue, I'll just leave it at "you're batshit insane"
