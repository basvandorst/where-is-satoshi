no less or more specific than "10 bitcoin is now equal in value to 1 pound of gold" or "100 bitcoin..." or "1 satoshi..." or "1 mbtc..."
they are all arbitrary units
what would be newsworthy is if the market cap of bitcoin surpassed the total value of all gold ever mined, thats a comparison that is actually interesting

Take a kidnapping for example. With cash, the kidnappers have to be there for the trade-off. With bitcoins, they can wait for the payment before they throw the kidnapee with a blindfold around their head out of a truck or something.
Do you agree or disagree that bitcoins  
a) reduce the risk of getting caught  
b) allow for larger ransoms because of no physical limit of cash being transferred  
c) make it easier to launder said ransom

You make the argument that if you profit from something, you have to give back.
I create a hypothetical situation in which you clearly benefit from my action, and should (by your reasoning) be obliged to pay or give back.
You claim that your original presumption does not apply because you do not profit monetarily from my actions in the above hypothetical situation.
I then ask you, in an attempt to discover the difference between the services provided by the state and the services provided by me in the hypothetical situation, which services provided by the state provide you with direct monetary profit.
You refuse to answer the question and point to irrelevance.

If you birth a child in my garage, the child is, per definition, my property.
I'm obviously joking, albeit that is unnervingly similar to the U.S. government's view on the issue.
The way I see your argument, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that you're comparing my ownership of the plot of land on which my home is situated to the alleged ownership of all U.S. soil by the state.
I consider this argument to be flawed in that one cannot just draw a few lines on a map around some land and immediately own the property therein, because they would not be legitimate owners of property under the [homestead principle](

I don't know; I'm not a customer, and I don't use their service, so I haven't read their terms of service, but if they promised you something and did not deliver, then you can sue for breach of contract.
That's not what's at question, here, however. killerstorm is asking whether it "bothers" anyone else that the operators of this service are making revenue.

Please note that I said "If the public key exists in the blockchain," which it does if coins have been sent from the corresponding address.

Of course you can. Granted, it's more difficult, as they have the infrastructure to handle quite a lot, but it's still possible.
Regardless, I'm not referring specifically to denial-of-service attacks, but also hacking or server seizure by the group of armed thugs we call the government.

Not really. If the public key exists in the blockchain, "lost" coins will be redeemed when quantum computing attacks become prevalent.

An increase in the amount transacted does not increase the cost of processing the transaction for the miners. The cost comes from the number and complexity of inputs, and this is what the current client uses to determine what fee will be used.
