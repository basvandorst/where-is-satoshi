I use Gemini, your bank deposits are pre credited so they are available for trading immediately, sucks the daily deposit limit is $500, but you can always wire.

Yeah it even went as low as $5600, I had no funds to buy the dip the whole weekend. By the time my funds were credited it was too late, at $6700 again.
