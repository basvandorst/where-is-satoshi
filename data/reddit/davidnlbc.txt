Hahaha... didn't know I got a reply.. Holding is awesome... A few dips so far, but it should pick up to 50K next year. Made a shit ton of money.. No trading for me.. Either holding or lending... BTW, if you wanna make some serious cash.. REPLY BACK, but I recommend you have alot of cash to play with tho..

I only use coinbase to send USD and or BTC.... I used GDAX to trade the limits because there's no fees.. Also, GDAX increased my daily limits to 50,000 dollars which is more than enough for me don't know if coinbase limits are the same as I never withdrawal any funds from there..

Chase Freedom just gave me an extra credit line of $19000 total without emailing me.. I want to buy 10K worth of bitcoin.. Do they charge cash advance? I have Chase freedom unlimited... I also have 12K limit on my american express card.... So far, I've purchased over 100K worth of bitcoin within the last 2 months straight with my own CASH.. I was wondering if using credit card works..

I just created my first reddit account because I was intrigued with this post.. So I've been following bitcoin a few years now, and I never bought it up until a month ago.. I bought it at 3600 (5 bitcoins). I thought to myself that trading would make me more money instead of holding and boy was I wrong.. Had I hold my 5 coins I would probably make more than 12K in profits.. But guess what? I sell and trade and when it's all said and done I only profited 1200 dollars. At the time bitcoin kept fucking with my mind... Whenever I buy, bitcoin would either show no movement for days and just decrease in price... And when I sell, bitcoin would just shoots through the roof. Now my money is left in exchange, and I'm trying to get in on the low and hold that bitch.. It's a shame... Went from 5 bitcoin to now I can only buy 2 bitcoin. Hopefully it go down again, so I can get in at 3 bitcoin. Then I'm creating a wallet..  No more trading for me.. Lets see how far it can go up in price... REMEMBER, when bitcoin drops it's a good sign that it will beat the last high.. The more it dip in price the more investment comes in play... I see it happens all the time. Imma be that guy that just going to hold it for the long term. Imagine 1 trillion market cap by in 2018.. We're going to make a shit load of money..
