Because big law firms are run by old people who did all their "typesetting" on primitive typewriters. Such things didn't have italics, bold, different fonts or font sizes. So, for emphasis, you could either underline or capitalize.
Unfortunately, their practices, whatever their original merit, continue to be used on computers because of tradition, habit, and foolish obstinacy. Younger lawyers look to see how older lawyers do things, or worse, how some curmudgeonly judge wants things to appear, and pattern their work accordingly.

I think you raise an important point here. Even if the operator is on the up-and-up, his business deals with bitcoins, an issue the government is raising a stink about. Paypal wants to stay as far away as possible from anything that will bring the government's fist down on it or will cause the government to increase regulation. 
Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if trading in bitcoins wasn't prohibited by Paypal's ToS. 
EDIT: Looks like it is against ToS.

Yes and no. 
They _could_ get around the law, but by definition, that's a violation of law, and they'd be subject to whatever punishment that entails. That's (probably) not a big deal for an end user, but it puts extreme pressure on a business model.

Ah, yes. I think I heard something about the registered nick, but I thought it had to do with the bitcoin-otc channel's internal system. e
Absent initially registering a nick via a proxy, or a trip out using some open wifi, I guess tor is of limited use on freenode.
Beyond these technical issues, though, I've had the same questions on how to effectuate a transaction with bitcoin at a distance. I'm interested in selling a little bit of physical gold for bitcoins, but I'm not sure how to do it without someone bearing an unacceptable amount of risk.

Upvote for giving the writer the benefit of the doubt.
I'd love to see a good critical article that educates me about problems with bitcoin. For instance, the issue of scalability---I don't know much about it, but it's one thing that those in the know seem to be concerned about.
But this article was not useful in the least. As others have said elsewhere, it's nothing but FUD.

I'm pretty sure the FDIC is funded like any other insurance: through premiums on the covered bank.

@_date: 2012-09-11 14:39:20
I don't think you quite get how the FDIC works.
The FDIC isn't connected with the Federal Reserve. If the FDIC ran out of money, it would have to get more from the banks (increase premiums) or from the federal government. The FDIC has no power to print money or increase the money supply.
Yes, getting money from the federal government might, in combination with other factors, cause the Fed to increase the money supply, but the connection is tenuous.
Moreover, the FDIC is a limited insurance; it only insures basic deposits, and only up to $250k, if I remember correctly. Much of what is permitted by fractional reserve banking is not covered by FDIC insurance.

If I had to guess, if it was illegal, it was because they are a pawn shop, and not an ordinary seller. Keeping all transactions in dollars makes it slightly harder to fence stolen goods, and make pawn shops easier to regulate.

No, I don't think it's a difference of semantics. If a major government, particularly the US government, wanted to make bitcoins a permanent backwater of internet technology, it could. Yes, prohibition wouldn't remove the idea of bitcoins, let alone shut down all the nodes and the thus the trade in bitcoins. Much the same, the government also can't stop the sale and use of illicit drugs, despite the fact that both are prohibited. Nevertheless, try to start an economy based on cocaine, and see how far you get. 
Here's how harsh US laws are when you trade in prohibited substances: say I sell you some marijuana. The money I get from the transaction? If caught, it's forfeited, meaning the government keeps it, and it's not credited towards any fines I may incur. If I stick the money in the bank? Well, the feds require $10k before they'll get off their asses, but if I put that much into the bank, I commit another crime—money laundering. Hell, if I go and gamble with that money, it's money laundering. 
Now say I know all this, I don't want to deal with marijuana directly. Say I involve someone like Coinbase, and let them handle the marijuana, and I get paid in dollars. Doesn't matter—I'm in a conspiracy, a conspiracy to distribute a prohibited substance, and possibly a conspiracy to launder money. And if you don't know about conspiratorial liability, there's a surprise for you; as a member of a conspiracy, you're criminally liable for every crime committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. So every distribution, ever bank transaction potentially increases the jail time you face.
Like I said, bitcoins can still exist in this environment, and might be useful for some limited situations, but can you really see businesses put their existence and all their property on the line just because of some idea. Hell, if bitcoins were made illegal, the market would become much less liquid. Much less liquid means greater risk, and the value of a bitcoin would drop like a rock.
In this sort of environment, the Streisand effect doesn't have any real value. Yes, more people know about it, but if the risk is too how, it's not going to matter. I can understand people getting drugs despite their prohibition, but they have an intrinsic value that bitcoin or any similar cryptocurrency lack. If the very use and trade in bitcoins becomes illegal, it becomes almost impossible for them to be useful in any sort of economy worth participating in.

Yes, but I don't see how that can possibly get you around regulations, unless your off-the-books transactions are much smaller than your on-the-books transactions. And if that's the case, what's the point? If you're running a legitimate, profitable business, why risk fines and prison time for a small bit more of profit?
@_date: 2013-10-12 17:59:24
Oh, definitely. But a lot (most?) are sitting things out until it seems safe again. Take a look at the SR and other subs where the black markets are discussed. When vendor reviews and other market drama thrived, there's mostly talk of arrests, how sketchy the new markets are, and similar worries.
@_date: 2013-02-22 23:19:34


And why can't they? Yes, the government would have a hell of a time enforcing it completely, but any business that put up a "We accept bitcoin!" notice on its window or website would put a target on itself in any jurisdiction that outlaws or even regulates bitcoin. Yeah, you can keep your keys secret, make it nearly impossible for the government to take the bitcoins you received as payment for your goods or services, but that's cold comfort after the government has taken your other property and placed you in prison.


This statement borders on the absurd, and seems completely groundless. What about a government making it harder to use bitcoin would convince a person/business that they should use it?

Bitcoin itself isn't regulated and generally won't succumb to regulation. However, Bitcoin-users, both individuals and businesses, can and will be regulated. 
Yes, if you've sufficiently hardened your wallet, the government will never be able to take your bitcoins. But you'll not likely enjoy them if your in prison, nor will you appreciate the fact that the government is just as happy to take your other property in lieu of any bitcoins it can't reach.

Who says an audit is necessary? If you haven't filed a tax return, your fucked, because it's obvious you have income. If you have, and you're employed by someone who reports you wages, but there's a discrepancy, you're fucked. If you're self-employed, but you don't have records to corroborate your tax declarations, you're fucked.
Now in all those instances, you've been thrown through the legal ringer, and the tax man hasn't even had to do a real audit. But even a superficial audit will turn up a lot more income to explain. With mortgage/rent, car payment, utility payments, phone/internet payments, you've got a good chunk of the average middle-class income. If you've declared less income than that, and don't have the debt to show for it, then you're fucked. Even if you declare just that amount, you're still not free and clear, because obviously there are other necessary living expenses beyond those.
And again, maybe bitcoins _can't_ be confiscated directly, but it won't matter much if you're imprison and the government sells off as much property as you're declared to owe in fines, back taxes, and late fees. Moreover, there's some support for the proposition that a judge can sit your ass in prison until you turn over the bitcoins you do have.
Yes, bitcoin makes evasion easier, especially on the edges. But the modern regulatory state isn't going to lie down and go limp because bitcoins make enforcement harder.

This may be one place where bitcoin's usual strengths are its weaknesses.
If US online gambling becomes available again, without bitcoin, casinos are going to have good reason to ignore bitcoin: moving dollars is hard. If a person wants to take their money another online casino, it's a several day process. You'd be lucky to play at 2 different places with the same money in the same week. Dollars lock you in. Once casinos figure this out, they'll try to keep bitcoin out.
Moreover, there's the issue with reporting laws. I know the US government has its eyes on casinos to watch for money laundering, but I'm not sure how deep that goes. But if you hit a jackpot or have a lucky streak, I'm fairly certain you'll have to present ID for tax forms to take possession of your +$600 worth of winnings. There goes anonymity, if that was your goal.
Finally, if US dollar denominated casinos come back, they'll have no interest in taking bets denominated in bitcoins. For the near-to-medium term at very least, bitcoins betters will be a small fraction of the online gambling public. Running games in two different currencies will be messy. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 22:52:53
Because entirely and effectively anonymous is really, really difficult. 
If you're talking about informal transactions between individuals, or transactions conducted through a setup like Silkroad, then yes, regulation isn't going to be effective.
However, that changes quickly if we imagine bitcoin being used like any other method of payment, online or offline. Anonymity melts away, and now he have businesses that can easily be forced to account for their bitcoin transactions. You can't put out a sign that says, "Yes, I accept bitcoins!", then play dumb when the tax collector comes calling. You'll have a forensic accountant up your ass before you know it. 
Think of it another way: cash is as much anonymous as bitcoin is. But just because you conduct you run a cash-only business, it doesn't make you immune to regulation. Yes, regulation may be easier to skirt, and even under scrutiny, you may be able to get away with not reporting some transactions. But if you're imagining a world where bitcoin is a robust, widely-accepted means of exchange, then be prepared for some regulation.

I just don't see a way for businesses to become totally unregulatable. Political ideologies and preferences aside, I don't see how a government would let the situation progress to the point where taxes aren't collected. 
Even if the economy developed to the point that bitcoins were the dominant means of exchange, and even if businesses were able to maintain perfectly anonymous bitcoin ledgers, there are still so many other points where you can get caught in regulation.
Imagine an Amazon replacement that ran on bitcoins—Bitazon. Bitazon has everything you need, from razors to diapers to breakfast cereal to big screen TVs. How is it going to hide all those warehouses? How is it going to hide all the shipping that takes place? How it is going to hide all of its employees and vendors? Yes, Bitazon may be able to set up a marketplace where a government doesn't know what it's selling to whom and for how much, but a government doesn't need to know exact amounts. It need only know that Bitazon isn't in compliance with tax laws. And in short order Bitazon is liquidated while its executives are sitting in prison.
On the other end of the spectrum, imagine a guy who does freelance programming for a living. He works anonymously, is paid in bitcoins, etc. This guy has to live somewhere. If he's paying his rent or mortgage, even with bitcoins, a government is going to know that he has income that hasn't been properly taxed. Yes, again, a government may not be able to prove how much income he earned exactly, but that doesn't matter. It's enough to know that he didn't, and once that's established, again comes severe penalties.
Simply put, in the modern complex economy, bitcoin isn't a magical elixir that suddenly makes regulation impossible. It only makes it more difficult. 
@_date: 2013-10-12 17:24:35
I don't think it was an overall negative. Instead, it is something slightly more complex. 
I think there was some fear that SR commerce was a major support for bitcoin prices. When SR fell, shaky hands dropped their coins, and the price fell some. But not that much. Once the swing started back up, there was a new confidence that while SR was helpful, it was not essential to bitcoin, and the economy outside of it is big enough to sustain the current market price.
