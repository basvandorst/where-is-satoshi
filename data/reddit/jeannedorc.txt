Yes, those "other fiats" and gold. Bitcoin is not seen as reliable unless you're discussing relative to Zimbabwe, which is still pretty low on the "people will invest in times of strife" chart.
Your conclusion is based on the view that persons widespread believe in the ideology more than they believe in it for speculative purposes, and would continue to do so at risk to their personal security.

Microsoft and Dell would spend more on the accountants than they could possibly gain from holding. There's no value-add. If they wanted some to play with, they could afford to do so.

When it is used in forex trading, it can be compared to the behavior of other currencies.
When treated as a security or speculative vehicle, it can be compared to other securities or targets of speculation.
When it is hlodled, it can be compared to other hedges or stores of value.
When it is used as a payment processor or money transmitting, it can be understood in relation to the behavior of other payment processors or merchant services.
No unique characteristics are going to make it impossible to compare to other things that have come before. Bitcoin is certainly an iteration on many well-understood economic tools, developments, and models.

Given Bitcoin goes "to the moon", you'll still have oppressive governments and rich people who have a lot of influence over the world.
Bitcoin also is not "the Internet", but destabilized regions have always existed and Twitter matters far less than the forces behind revolution. There is no reason for things to operate any differently than they always have.

Oh yeah. There's a current ring that phish Auctiva accounts, then add a bunch of $5k-10k items and send out fake Paypal invoices to the legit seller's account (usually with sales over 2000).
They're easy to observe considering they usually sell trinkets and cheap items otherwise, but yet people still bite.
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:27:46


Or perhaps this is not the case. If it was, why would anyone stop accepting Bitcoin?

Bitcoin will not eradicate pedophilia. Allowing ill-actors to profit off of child-rape through such markets certainly will not help as well.

It's not an all or nothing thing. Bitcoin is great for darknetmarkets or censorship-resistant purchases and most people on Buttcoin agree. It's not really great for a lot of everyday uses that people try to shoehorn it in for, especially when those everyday uses involve a sea of unnecessary middlemen like Bitpay and Coinbase.

Bitcoin can not make itself manifest in phyisical form and provide fiat cash at an endpoint. That is not a simple problem.
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:18:01
That's your answer. Consumers passively to actively expect every Bitcoin business to subsidize the currency, even smaller businesses.
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:24:26
Set your expectations properly, you are never going to make money mining. The scale is well beyond consumer and commodity hardware.
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:56:28


But it's not, it's just allowing initial investors to cash out. If Bitpay, Coinbase etc disappear you'll lose 90% of the businesses that "accept Bitcoin".

Of course, what's ideal to a particular ideology will not be to another. Some people do not enjoy the present externality of a child porn "market", even if it protects some other transactions from State censorship.

Right, and a good amount of my rubbernecking on Bitcoin is that I'm fascinated by technology and people, and the substituting of technical non-"fixes" for social problems because "it couldn't possibly be worse than what we have in place" while simultaneously wishing to be the same people in charge and handwaving away of all externalities... it's sort of like an ant farm of humanity.

@_date: 2014-09-17 13:39:35


These people are more than speculators, they have (supposedly, but doubtful in actuality) their entire income stream going to BTC. Of course someone who does not receive their entire income converted to Bitcoin would be interested to know how this person's putting their coin where their mouth is would affect greater adoption.

I have all the sympathy in the world for businessowners, I've been on both ends (customer and employee of the business) and the process for chargebacks is fairly straightforward and rarely involve fraud.
The customer files for a chargeback (for whatever reason), are granted a TEMPORARY credit by the bank, and the businessowner has several months to respond to the claims. If they have paperwork and can prove they provided the service and product to the customer, the likelihood of  a successful chargeback is slim.
I can understand the benefit to the businessowner, and I can see sometimes unfortunate fuckups on the USPS' end, but the business can refund the customer before a chargeback becomes necessary and seek out recompense from the shipper. I can also understand Bitcoin as a "solution" to this, but it's not a critical problem in most lines of business. I can see its utility for clips site sellers who claim their card was "stolen", but not your average goods peddler.

They love Rand. They love her "message". That she supported birth control and was an avowed Atheist is literally irrelevant to those Christians, who likely believe her "good work" was waylaid by Satan or some such.
All that matters is that a great majority of those who identify as Christian cheer at her name publicly and support her works without complaint.

Those exchanges which offer "instant buybacks" do so offchain, so I'm not sure how that'd affect the price at all.
@_date: 2014-09-22 12:32:29
I'm glad we agree, then.
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:11:50
Right, but that's not what was stated. A debit card being run through Mastercard.




I'm going to guess that it's because of your specific trade. That outrageous level of fraud isn't endemic to all other small businesses.
It'd be a lot more honest if people specified the type of small business concerned versus suggesting it's common for all businessowners.

I don't think there's one specific bad attitude, but ultimately if you want to Be Your Own Bank, someone stating "Well, this is how we treat the grown-ups and reduce money-laundering" is inevitably responded to with
"WE ARE *NOT* BANKS THIS IS UNFAIR"
and 
"There is literally no such thing as money laundering, stop imposing *your* moral judgment on my rational transactions"

Mining is now reaching a temporary saturation point, and perhaps the startup space (and especially the altcoin space) is starting to get there as well. Assuming the stream of cash flowing into the space continues apace, it will have nowhere to go but into directly buying bitcoins again, inducing the next price run-up.

I'm interested in Bitcoin's purpose as a social experiment and how people both project their ideology onto the technology and the various internal forces keeping it from reaching mainstream adoption. It's legitimately fascinating to watch. "Bitcoin" as a whole is neutral, I am interested in how it sucks and how that's either by design for some, or how it's glossed over or ignored by others. I also pay attention to see if there are any use cases that could potentially crop up that might be useful to me, I just haven't found any yet.
I also know those who work in the payments industry and know a little of how that works, so it's interesting to see their experiences compared to Bitcoin's attempts to mimic existing systems and how it varies.
There's plenty of lulz but I enjoy learning at the same time.

I don't think it's implausible. Most persons who are homeless are transitionally so and won't necessarily lose their bank account (being poor doesn't mean that they carry a low enough balance that their accounts would be fined/closed, and being poor doesn't mean you would write rubber checks either.) smart phones are a necessary link to the outside world and can be had prepaid, it's probably easier to find/retain those two than find permanent lodging near permanent work.
Also, seeing as check cashing is pricier without an account, it would make sense that as an "employee" of the organization, they would encourage direct deposit and finding an account for the bankless.

Anyhoo, the State can deal with this stuff in a way that doesn't lead to violence as well.

In many cases not even, only the amount that you spent in fees.
For the more "regulated" businesses at least up to a small value, *perhaps* for the full amount deposited, but you asked what we think without looking up the specifics, and there doesn't appear to be a lot of persons verifying what the insurers offer and what the TOS' claim as it is.

PayPal will not think fondly of chargebacks against them versus "legitimate" customers.
They didn't open up a PayPal dispute because they were outside the 90 day window and they knew they were at fault. If you provide the tracking number to PayPal, PayPal will provide it to the bank for the chargeback, and the chargeback will be found in PayPal's favor.
Call PayPal again and if you're persistent, you can easily triumph here. Their facts don't jibe with the reality of the situation and the data in PayPal's system.

California consumers should be aware Coinbase Exchange is not regulated or licensed by the State.”

You're not fixing the problems, you're lying to the disadvantaged about how they will get money out of Bitcoin, as it is currently useless for their needs.


No, I know Bitcoin is not a competition to the established remittance systems. I find people who exploit and deceive the underclass (like yourself) to enrich themselves under the guise of "charity" abhorrent. 


Good, your self-proclaimed "honor" is worthless to me based on your rhetoric. 
If you want to better the system we have in place, start from a place of honesty about the actual endpoints the impoverished must get the money into and out of Bitcoin from. Stop being deceptive. Western digital is more an end-to-end ecosystem than a protocol/currency, the two are not directly comparable as you are attempting to do.

It still sounds a bit abstract, I'm unsure what technical breakthroughs exist that would promote Ripple over any other cryptocurrencies.

That's what I'm saying, and why Bitcoin is not an end-to-end solution for them.
I'm not saying consumers have an emotional investment in the brand, just that "Bitcoin" is not an ecosystem that they're looking for.
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:03:10


No, they offer an endpoint. This is why Bitcoin sans-middlemen is not taking off in the remittances market, you need to seek out an additional endpoint for all your needs.

It is. They were notified.

That's evident considering the size of their hot wallet and the scope of their loss.

For one, the Raspberry Pi isn't hardware-locked into 21's mining pool.
But that's a reason to not use their dongle.
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:16:05
Impossible, this is a trustless accounting and surely a public ledger is auditable.
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:31:22


And you're still adding an additional step in the process, not cutting out any middlemen.
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:50:24
Because it doesn't.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:12:19


That rationale makes no sense, developers already own general purpose computers and can code for ARM.
@_date: 2016-05-15 19:08:36
Yes, you're talking out of your ass.
@_date: 2016-05-14 17:24:53


You're bad at math if you think this statement makes any sense.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:10:03
As an employee, they're not going to divulge that information.
@_date: 2016-05-14 17:26:14


Obviously, but that has nothing to do with your initial claim.

And such a tiny amount of people give a shit about ChangeTip. Patreon and similar services engulf them completely.

@_date: 2015-11-20 20:28:16
You do not require the device to develop for embedded architectures, especially if you already own the $30 RPi. That's the entire argument, and there has not yet been any reason why the dongle is required beyond wanting to fleece hobbyists who don't know better.
@_date: 2015-02-14 22:24:06
Simple, it's not a profitable business, and at maximum interest was still losing money in the hopes of being acquired.
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:19:03
Nah, they know there's little brick &amp; mortar interest. This is more about the veneer of respectability.
@_date: 2015-11-20 17:49:24
But there's nothing yet "built" that you can't do with Bitcoin, and not restricted to 21inc's pool which faucets satoshis back. It's not a "miner" for the end user, it's a way to get users to subsidize 21inc's mining operation.

Why are you so emotionally invested in an overpriced Dev kit where the only thing of "value" is a free Python library?

The media coverage is the million dollar benefit, not the small number of Bitcoin sales.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:31:13


WU isn't even necessarily a "ripoff". Depending on what you're sending, where to, and if the person needs to buy/hold Bitcoin to make this happen it could be a *much* better deal than the Bitcoin option.
If you already have a bank account, you could also just send Paypal.

@_date: 2015-02-10 05:42:11

Because most people send mail through the USPS, not *to* the USPS stations themselves.


And these situations would still involve getting money into and out of Bitcoin regularly, hence the problem.


I certainly do as well, most "just use Bitcoin" answers come off as insincere to me. People haven't thought the option through very carefully.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:01:02
It won't, directly. They invested in Coinbase as a Paypal competitor, not in Bitcoin.

I didn't say it was actually getting people to use Bitcoins when they wouldn't have before, I said it was getting the tech and financial media to reblog mentions of Microsoft, Dell, etc, when they wouldn't have. Millions of dollars of press for free.


This is outright stupid. They are companies that want to make money.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:47:25
Right, much cheaper than the current miner-subsidized $30 per transaction?
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:40:34


It takes additional development work, and requires additional logistical efforts if you don't immediately convert to fiat (which, granted, most all persons who "accept bitcoin" do.)
@_date: 2015-02-12 03:49:29
Sure, depending on what they feel someone will respond to the best.
@_date: 2015-02-17 03:57:10
Pfft, facts. Paypal, Visa Checkout, Google, AmEx, Discover, Mastercard, funny what's missing.

None of them have "adopted Bitcoin". They accept it so long as it costs them nothing to do so, they have not released any subsequent press releases about their successes with Bitpay, etc.


No, as I said, they don't "believe", the media coverage they received is enough.

No, Coinbase left because there's very little consumer interest in tipping services. The data they published on Changetip's transactions proves that.
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:16:09


They didn't say their background was professional, educational, or profitable.

Oh, only that?

Ooh, your "background in sales and marketing" sounds really prestigious. Boiler room operation, phone book ad cold calling, or Amway?
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:08:42


Because none of the people you mentioned accept Bitcoin, they *only accept fiat currency provided at the time of sale* through Bitpay, Coinbase, etc.
Nobody's buying Bitcoin to use for these purposes as well, it's just the slow drain-out from initial adopters.
@_date: 2015-02-19 03:22:27
Rumors, not news.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:13:02
No, but very close.
When people do market comparisons with Bitcoin, they really need to research these claims before they spout them uncritically. People tend to make up the competition's angle.

@_date: 2015-02-08 21:46:18


They are not. Companies, large and mid-sized do not touch Bitcoin. They immediately receive fiat currency. The Bitcoin economy is used for early adopters to cash out, and is currently only adopted by these larger companies for free PR, and because the costs of which are absorbed and subsidized by VC funds.
Without VC injection, Bitpay and Coinbase would disappear, without Bitpay and Coinbase, 99% of "Accepts Bitcoin" companies would no longer accept bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-02-04 16:46:02


There are not enough companies interested in accepting Bitcoin directly to affect fiat currency in any way. Bitcoin transactions that are not dust are primarily speculative buys and sells, there are not many purchases being made using the currency.


Companies don't exist to lose money.
