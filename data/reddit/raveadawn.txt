Since a lot of people don’t have access to the Donald Duck I took pictures; 
It’s only in Dutch, so if you have some questions I would be happy to translate. Veel plezier!

Spoiler alert!
I have read the comic and it is actually addressing some solid points:
* Young rich kid ‘Chip Knip’ (nice lil’ reference tot the payment method Chipknip) comes in the billionairs club. First Dagobert envy’s the kid, later they become bro’s.  
* Dagobert has a lot of problems with storing his physical money because he is quitte greedy. Yet, he is intrigued by Chip Knip and follows his advice to store his money digitally.
* The ‘Zware Jongens’ complain they can not steal his money anymore and are angry
* While Dagobert and Chipknip are having diner in a fancy restaurant, the internet crashes. All the digital millionaires flee the restaurant. Chip Knip needs to wash dishes because he can not access his money anymore. 
* Dagobert invested his previous physical money in paper factories. Business is booming and he profits from the crash of the internet. He restores his wealth immediately. He learns to invest better in keeping his money safe. 
For the past 20 years I am subscribed to Donald Duck. Still, it amazes me how they come with relevant stories each week. Truly amazing team who is inspiring the next generation.

Yes my bad. Forgot to address it, he invests a large sum of his physical money in to paper factories. He quotes “(..) The paper factory stocks are rising since paper is needed again”. The other part he invested in to Bitcoin. 
Sends the right message not to go all in at once.
