I actually agree. I grew up reading and always felt impressed with nuanced language. Nowadays you use a perfectly utilized multi syllable word and you’re a douchebag 
I’m not interested in appearing smart I’m interested in learning from people who know more than I do about a subject

I did a excel sheet on $50 over the past 52 weeks... turned some 2600 into nearly 10k 
Weekly buys are the way to go, it guarentees you "some" dips and mitigates the highs

Bam, beautiful logic is beautiful.
I'm 26 so I've got 100% of my tax advantages channels invested in stocks and I'm doing 10% this year. Not bad, 456% ain't bad either

In my personal opinion (and its only that)  the point of 'dollar cost averaging' is, especially with such a volatile currency, to leverage against large movements and to attempt to get the average cost available for the currency.
With Bitcoin, ethereum, and some of my other coins, I believe they are wholly undervalued at today's price, so in my situation it would do me best to get in period. Knowing that it is "impossible to time the market" and that I cannot look at coin charts 24 hours a day AND that greed is the root cause of loss in any investing, I choose to attempt to catch 400%, even though I realistically could catch significantly more than that.
But if I really could, I would have already. And despite our generous opinions of ourselves most of us are incapable of really successfully doing that.
All that being said, investing a smaller amount monthly might be a good idea as one can reasonably assume that the price of Bitcoin or whatever crypto will be more next month than it will this month and you could be unnecessarily missing out on potential profits. I'm sure there's math that can be done to conclude the best time frame, I've personally just picked every Friday because of the effect the weekend has on the price and because I always have an extra $50 kicking around on Fridays to invest. 
News, major events, and gossip all have bearing on the weekly price of a crypto.
And to just answer your question frankly, I'd see if there's a pattern to the lowest price of Bitcoin every month and stick to that. Baring that, I'd invest your money the day it becomes available to invest. Just get in soon while its fresh. 
Cheers mate,  and see you off planet ��

There are a couple points that you should NEVER deviate from, even experimentally, they are 100% proven fact! 
1. Financial freedom is a marathon!
2. The universal magic voodoo WILL punish greed! Good things happen to bad people but greedy people always get fucked!
3. Smart investing is exactly that, smart. As in develop a percentage of your income that goes here there and over that away, and STICK to it! 5% Bitcoin 3.2% ethereum 20% student loans. Print it out, use it as a Standard Operating Procedure! 
4. Bitcoin will not make you rich. Peep this: 
If Bitcoin is worth 60,000 one day, which means that there is more than 1 Trillion dollars JUST in Bitcoin (plausible but unlikely) and you MAGICALLY invested $100,000 today into Bitcoin (again unlikely) your Bitcoin would only be worth $380,000. This is a lot but let's keep in mind you don't have 100k and it's still only a freaking awesome 600% return... Is that return gonna happen over 1 year or 10 years? Idk... But you're still beating the market. Regardless, the market does improve over time (imagine investing from 2008 to 2012! You'd be so happy!) 
My point here is is a smart investment, but smart investing has rules. 
5. Emotional trading will screw you so hard. Don't get excited about money, be ruthless and cold. Don't ever trade rumors. I stupidly sold a small amount of Bitcoin during the whole Bitcoin cash fiasco. Bitcoin than jumped from 7k up to 9k+, and I bought back in at a loss. 
We aren't super traders, or quants, or prodigies. We are regular human beings who are in the know Ina N powerful financial movement. Let's be smart, but cautious!
Good luck my friend, fight the good fight, and make decisions today for the benefit they provide you tomorrow!

One small additional bit of advice, and I totally understand you disregarding it. 
Consider your crypto speculation an investment you make AFTER you've fulfilled some more pressing financial tasks. Paying off high interest debt and maxing out your IRA removes doubt about the future and has a more important and more immediate return than Bitcoin ever will.
If we're all wrong and Bitcoin pops tomorrow, you'll still have reduced your debts and you'll still have your retirement account.
I don't plan nor expect to get insanely rich on Bitcoin. I invest maybe 8% of my income into Bitcoin because it's a smart investment, but I put significantly more into my Ira and my debts and those always come first. 
I'm obviously assuming two points about you with this but I think it bears mentioning (:

This is a direct result of the tariffs. I imagine it will continue as long as there is uncertainty
