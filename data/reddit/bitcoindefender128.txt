Ammunition to weaken the integrity of bitcoin cash.

Interesting, I would like to think this would never happen... But perhaps you're more of a futurist and this is a real possibility. You have me thinking.....!

Interesting. I suppose hope plays into this. One of the main proponents of bitcoin is that it will seriously mitigate wars in general.

IMO, people sold before Christmas to not worry about crashes/prices. Bought in after. (My 2 cents)

"A roadmap for getting to blocks large enough to handle 2 on-chain transactions (one deposit, one withdrawal) per week for 1% of the earth's population (~150m tx/1008 blocks = 149k tx/block)"
The only answer to this is better compression algorithms that still allow the average person to run a full node with the entire blockchain.

The beauty of crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:26:30
I've been in crypto for a while and truly believe it will change the world. We all know the potential society changing benefits; but the gains along the way are a bonus.

Can someone actually trademark this and essentially own it?
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:26:32
They make money one way or another. It's probably through advertisements. You're probably better off making minimal wage somewhere and just buying bitcoin with the wages.

Anthony Regalbuto, 20, was nabbed driving a 2006 Land Rover on Amboy Road near Eugene Street at 9 p.m. Wednesday, law-enforcement sources said.
After Regalbuto was pulled over, a DMV check revealed that his license had been suspended three times and that one suspension had been for refusing to submit to a chemical test, authorities said.
Regalbuto later admitted his license had been revoked and that he was carrying someone else’s license.

Link broken, also tried searching bitcoin cash. Please update link if you don't mind.

So if I were to advertise "bitcoln cash" as the next big cryptocurrency and it's really a sham I release and mine on my own it would be totally legal?
I want to and am ready to threaten/weaken bitcoin cash's integrity.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:29:40
I see why people try but in all honesty I don't think it will ever work. Thanks for the info.

Anyone can register ownership of a new trademark... but if anyone battles this in court they will be laughed at.. However, this is good ammunition to throw at bcash users...
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:28:20
I am not looking to scam people by all means. I was thinking about launching a terrible bitcoin cash campaign or something similar. I understand screwing over uneducated bitcoin/bcash users hurts all cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:15:45
I suggest you stay away from them.
