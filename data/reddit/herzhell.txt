A big state or government, or a big private institution are dangerous for civilizations.
Friedman was just a neoliberal preacher, bankster's love.
Every big power, public or private power, is dangerous for society.
Bitcoin is a community based on an open project.
On game theory and economics, John Nash explained how a cooperative game is better for society, so that's showing Bitcoin's life, A BIG COOPERATIVE GAME.
Everyone can support, develop and enjoy without a boss or 'dealer'.

I found something useful.
The 'cosmos' word is at Spanish dict on bip-39.
Install a wallet in Spanish or try Bither or Electrum &gt;2.6, maybe it works.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:06:29
Try this Ledger app.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:29:41
had it worked?

Which exchange did You use?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:42:46
Had You try  ?
Maybe would be useful.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:43:21
I think, even if You have a Trezor wallet would work, it has a support on bip-39.

Yes, I think is really bad, it is not a real arise. It's trying to take over BTC market in a really misleading way.
It's just a fake pump.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:42:34
That's not a noob question. You did your homework.

Maybe naive question, but why someone will do this? profit?
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:44:53
¿Opinion? 
BCH 'developers' and supporters are taking advantage of every BTC aspect. That's not an opinion. BCH is a fact BS.

Fork You!

It MUST say something like:

Misleading Bitcoin.com will take a huge advantage of Bitcoin.org, like has been made.

You're right. 
I would like to understand how address types change fee calculation.

@_date: 2017-10-31 14:51:37
Found this.
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:12:05
I support your argument. 
In fact I think this is how big banksters will join Bitcoin environment. 
They won't invest, they will try to own EVERYTHING.
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:21:35
No, you want to change that 'few elites'.
You are allowing to Banksters to take over Bitcoin market.
