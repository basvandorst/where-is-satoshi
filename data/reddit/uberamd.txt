That’s kinda what I do. I also have a script where I define coins pairs I’m interested in, and high/low price thresholds, and when those are crossed i get paged on my phone via OpsGenie.

Yes, statements generally obtain their meaning based on the words used.

Why wouldn't they?

I mean come on, the dude was complaining about his CRM software on twitter. Odds are all the customer/vendor data is in whatever CRM he's using.

Exactly right. I mean, come on people, just read the actual document. It outlines everything, from renting servers using his actual name and email, to IP addresses that trace back to hotels he stayed at, to using his own relatives network connections and being physically watched entering the residence, accessing the site, exiting the site, leaving the residence. 
The story is all laid out in total detail for anyone to read and comprehend.

They did, it's in the complaint. They even matched his exact Chrome version and OS X version (beta version of Chrome, outdated version of OS X) on multiple sites he accessed.

Honestly, after reading the complaint, the only thing that stood out to me was how fucking dumb this guy was.

Did you read the full indictment against this guy? It all sounds incredibly strong. Yeah, their language should have been more neutral, however in the official press release they do say that he is innocent until proven guilty.

Why not? If he had actually received the machine it wouldn't be "risking 25k", it would have instead been buying a machine for $25k to see how it works as a money maker.
Not to mention that $25k isn't an outrageous amount of money to a lot of people.

Remember the 4chan price prediction that was right like 2 times so people ate it up because “charts don’t lie”, only to be wildly off on its October 2019 price prediction?
This sub drools over any chart that makes them think they’ll get a redo at late 2017 again.

Sometimes the best friends to have are the ones willing to be honest directly to your face.

Dude, ignore all these people giving you shit. You did what you’re comfortable with, using your money. If Robinhood goes under there will be a LOT of people with bigger bags than you chomping at the bit to get back at RH. 
Sure, not your keys not your crypto, but it’s not like you gave $100k to an unknown entity. 
Keep doing what you’re comfortable with and don’t let the elitists here get you down.

Also coinbase pro wasn’t available everywhere for quite some time. One day my friend just told me he uses it and that’s how I realized it was now available in my state. 
But no mobile app is a turn off for casuals, even though their site works fine in mobile browsers.
