When I send btc from one exchange to another, I send a small amount first to a long scrambled email/number. When I send the next batch of btc, do I send it to the same email/number or do I need to generate a new one?
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:04:19
sorry yea, i just wanna make sure cause i'm gonna be sending a good bit of coin and cant afford to lose it. and in the pass i have actually generating a new email to send the second amount of the btc (after the test deposit). if i remember correctly i have always generated a new email, so i guess i've been doing it wrong  
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:52:49
they aren't allowing now?

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:56:43
actually im in the red with omg. i think i about it when it was around 11$. this a few months about when bitcoin was around $4,000, right before it all the cryptos dropped due to that china ban rumors. so yea im so losing money on it
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:59:22

@_date: 2017-12-26 04:16:21

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:39:30
Somebody remind me, if I want to buy on gdax the limit price i set has to be above the current market price?
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:54:08
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:21:32
anyone here all fiat and waiting to buy til tomorrow?

@_date: 2017-12-26 21:07:13
damn i dont have a wallet
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:50:24
i'd be wary about litecoin. the litecoin creator sold all his holdings a week ago, and from what i've heard the litecoin code hasn't seen change in months. then again, i also heard they might be having a partnership with facebook. i think it will still go up a bit but i'd personally wouldnt buy into it for too long
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:32:47
How much does it cost to send btc from coinbase to bittrex or anything exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:07
I just found out bch was added to coinbase via email. I feel so late. When was it first announced? Should I still buy?
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:17:29
you are best investor here
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:49:16
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:38:15
This is so bad
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:40:15
Which exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:55

@_date: 2017-12-25 17:53:25
$20 to withdraw from coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:29:17
How long ago did you sign up submit the verification stuff to bitstamp?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:39:03
Why the hell is it going down
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:07:07

@_date: 2017-12-30 18:52:34
damn you
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:12:45
What about sending from other exchanges to gdax...is it free?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:31
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:28:34
What if I want to trade the coin tho? Seems like every couple of months it crashes and it's best to sell when it goes down and buy at the low point? Do you not do that?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:41:04
I want to mine also
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:00:50
its been a week im still waiting to get verified on bitstamp...
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:17:12

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:55:05
Are transfers from bittrrex to gdax also free?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:28:37

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:55
why? wouldn't people be FOMO buying?
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:22:30
We're dropping like a piece of shit
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:40:49
So just make sure to buy at the ask price and sell on the bid price?
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:07:55
Op can you send me a bitcoin or two please? i could really use it
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:02:20
If Bitcoin bid is at 4000, should I sell it at 3999? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:07:01
Thanks for the help. I was able to sell some Bitcoin. Now if I want to buy some later on do I buy slightly above the market? And there are no fees attached?
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:59:17
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:16:46
