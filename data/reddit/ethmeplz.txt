It's statements like this that shows just how mainstream BTC is becoming. For the sake of not spreading misinformation, the answer to that is no, it will never realistically reach Ethereum or IOTAs transaction speeds. If you have to ask why that is the case, then you need to do more research on the blockchain sorry.

Did you know theres no such thing as crash proof?
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:05:52
Bitcoin is way behind ethereum in terms of usage and transaction speed. Im invested in both but lets not kid ourselves

Haha I've made alot of decisions based on emotion resulting in substantial losses. Definitely I learnt myself and the majority of people are not suitable for day trading. Best advice to give is invest what money you can afford to lose in projects you believe in and wait for atleast one year to consider other options.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:52:11
Yup. You'll thank me for it in 2 years

Ok definitely in due time it could be feasible but the question is will it realisticly be introduced before Eth figures out how to fix centralization problems? I just dont see the motivation for the developers considering the already immense value of Bitcoin as an asset and the rapid increase in Eth adoption. Also the tangle already is implicitely not burdened by scalability issues so IOTA will be extremely disruptive once globally adopted

Just S1 though. S2 was meh

And dangerous. Market is sometimes purely driven by speculation...

Nows the time to sell your BTC to amass the next major coin game changer: IOTA
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:00:03
Ok in this case just hold bro. OMG is seriously one of the top coins in the market currently and it will be a huge shame to sell at a loss. You will end kicking yourself in a couple of months. IOTA is a great prospect as well but selling OMG at a loss to get IOTA at 1.4+USD is not a wise move. Standby for now and wait till OMG is back in the green for you and then consider IOTA
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:53:09
Honestly it all depends on the price and quanitity you entered on for OMG as both IOTA and OMG are excellent prospects for the future. If you bought into OMG sub 5USD I would sell some of your profit to get atleast 500Miota to 1Giota. However youre already winning with OMG IMO so only try IOTA if you can afford it

TBH, bitcoin is falling way behind interms of transaction speed when compared to Ethereum and its other competitors. The only reason BTC has such a large valuation is due to it being the first of its kind. To have BTC as a store of value is a given, however lets not kid ourselves into thinking it will compete with the likes of ethreum and IOTA technically in the future

There are 93 Bip39 words:
Im guessing a combination of the above words will unlock the wallet. With a brtual method you would need 93^^12 tries to exhaust all combinations for a 12 word setup.

You're still not able to pay with bitcoin though. It just acts as an exchange. More bearish outlook TBH

2018 has been the altcoin culling

bitcoin will fly to the moon once bch comes back online after the fork and everyone dumps to buy btc. We have reached the point where the bulls are going to start flying to the moon. Congratulations ladies and gents, tonight will be an epic nice for btc (and alt holders, apart from BCH and a few other shitcoins).

Keep in mind circulating supply will then actually be 21mill * 1000000bits = 21 000 000 000 000 bits if 100sat=1 bit
