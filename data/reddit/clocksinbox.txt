The market cap of Bitcoin is still very tiny when compared to other legacy currencies, so it's extremely easy to move the price at these levels when compared to other currencies with market caps in the trillions. At this price level, we're all whale watching while riding in a rubber raft from only a few feet away.
Bitcoin is decentralized, so no one is in control of its supply. There's no central authority that can manipulate the supply in order to diminish the impact of a boom and bust cycle. Bitcoin cannot go from nothing to a worldwide currency with a multi-trillion market cap without experiencing these vicious boom and bust cycles on the road to adoption.

Bitcoin can literally run by itself on a single PC. It's pretty much impossible to completely stop mining, because there will always be at least one person mining for it regardless of price or difficulty.

Is there a way to recover a local balance from a channel if the channel.db is lost? A few months ago I had to start from scratch again and I was able to successfully restore the wallet using the seed, but the channels (from the lost channel.db) are no longer accessible by my node.
