We don't really know how delicate markets are to time manipulation.

If you can buy a bitcoin, it still easy to use it to buy from someone far away. I'm not 100% clear if there will be a penalty if someone is buying with bitcoin, or if it's just selling/pricing that is banned.
And depending on the wording, there may be a loophole. E.g. If I have bitcoin, can I sell some to you for RMB, temporarily held as store credit, and then buy with that RMB? Link the market and the store.
TL;DR: One does not simply regulate bitcoin.

The premise of the thread is a 14 year old who wants to make a financial choice, and whose parents arbitrarily deny that choice. 
The suggestion to make that choice independently through local means is claimed to be incredibly irresponsible advice. (go and meet random people is not ok)
When this is presented as an obviously safe possibility, discussion turn to blowback against bitcoin by the parents. Then a back alley presumed by irrational parents became a back alley in a bitcoin exchange scenario. 
The pattern here is that parental authority is removing very safe options, and other reasonable options are smeared as dangerous because they violate parental authority. 
You say they're not slaves but the difference is how hard you can whip them.
Why can you whip them at all?

Deciding to trust e.g. coinbase and buying bitcoin is a one time hassle. The hassle also isn't fundamental to the system, There's no real reason you couldn't pay for bitcoin with a credit card. One of the reasons no one does it is because credit card fraud is too easy.
The key security advantage of bitcoin is that I can pay someone without trusting them with any secure information at all. 
The disadvantage is that I need to rely on the security of my own computer, which for most people is terrible. (or I need to use 2 factor authentication and trust coinbase to hold my money)
This security disadvantage can be dealt with by dedicated hardware wallets. (which could be as small as you want, and can be backed up in secure locations so you never lose your money.)

This is bad advice. It's too simple and appeals to emotion and fear of loss. 
How much to invest and when to cash out depends on how much you have to work with, how much you could earn, and how risky it is. Your thinking about these things needs to take that into account.

Why not get a little closer?

An ounce is not completely arbitrary. It is about how much coins should weigh, so it is related to gold's usefulness as a currency.
Currently, 1 bitcent is the smallest amount that can be reliably sent with no fees. 100th of an ounce would be a pretty small coin.

Multiplying by price would have at least gotten the right kind of unit,  but that chart wouldn't have made the bubble argument.
It also isn't a good argument the other way, what we need is good data on actual purchases. Blockchain transactions could be inflated by people moving money around, and deflated by both parties using an online service.

I'm sorry, did you have an argument beyond maintaining the status quo? You pointed out the arbitrariness of the current lines, they don't have to be arbitrary.
If parents can parent without giving bruises or scars, then they can also parent in a world where children can own personal property. This doesn't make it impossible to protect them, this makes it easier. 
You give no rule for what is too dangerous or not, but cite these dangers as a justification for authority.
It is exactly this enforced arbitrary authority that makes kids both vulnerable and stupid.

This whole thread is about buying bitcoin. An arbitrary status quo is the only reason parents are in the discussion, instead of just banks and coinbase.
The only parents relevant to the discussion are those exercising authority over what would otherwise be the child's property.
All the supposed fears and dangers of an offline meet are excuses to enforce that authority over money.

If your local coffee shop is potentially lethal, *move*.
Your train of logic going down to 3 works just as well going up  to 33. Why do you think you should be a free person?
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:39:17
This kind of work is clearly not age appropriate.

There are better options, but you just gave up on thinking.

[Kelly Criterion]( - It describes individual bets and makes some assumptions, but can be adapted to investing. It is certainly a better than some rule that doesn't even specify when to secure capital.

Online wallets on public computers! What could go wrong?
