I'm not talking about optimizing for faster payment confirmations. I'm saying 10 min is arbitrary. For example, it could be optimized to reduce the orphaning rate.

You went from saying that offchain solutions are not feasible, as if there is a technical issue that makes them impossible, to instead saying you are just philosophically against offchain solutions because you want every single transaction to be on the block chain.

This proposal from Gavin seems good. Garziks is good too. I also like "max block size = 2 * average size of last 144 blocks." They should all be implemented, and bitcoin core will use the lowest of the three.
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:01:59
If this is true, then all we need to do to fix the block propagation and orphan issue is to implement headers first block propagation.
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:47:12
I agree with you, but 20MB blocks are not 'irreversible damage'. 1MB blocks were always temporary and arbitrary. I'm glad to see discussion and like the elastic block size approach. Market driven is better then centrally dictated.

'Valid' blocks are defined by consensus already. It's already required they confirm to rules to be valid. Also, all nodes reject invalid blocks. Not just miners.

We've known for a long time that larger blocks take longer to propagate.

STFU. If a node has 500 transactions sitting in the mempool that were all first seen greater then 10 minutes ago, and a block comes across that includes less then 50% of them then it could reject the block or refuse to propagate it.

It's simply that variable change, and the problems we will be facing in the future well be far different then we predict.

The number of nodes on the network has nothing to do with keeping bitcoin decentralized. Bitcoin is decentralized because of Proof of Work mining.
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:17:03


It moves block size decisions to a market of miners instead of being centrally controlled and by the core devs .


Garziks solution is KISS. It follows miner voting procedures that have already been used.


Thats just judgemental.


Another simple solution, but there is not evidence to support that this equation is better. What about disenfranchising china?  What about the network having issues as the block size grows? What if fees dont increase as needed and the network fills with spam?  This solution addresses very little that BIP100 does in fact address.


Gavin has stated that he is in support of BIP100.

Actually, whatever rules are coded into the core software is what defines a valid block. Consensus among the nodes is what creates the valid chain. Nodes can override miners, though miners run nodes too.

@_date: 2015-06-04 00:05:08
That makes sense... but the block size issue has been brought up because of the concern of a crash landing of the network with too many unconfirming transactions. Increasing the transaction throughput is the ugly way to solve that. Addressing what to do about unconfirming transactions is the primary issue. The user experience and network will need to deal with insufficient fee transactions at any level of scale.

There are some obvious mistakes in what he said (such as not mentioning that the 1mb block size is arbitrary.)

It is also not the consensus from the core devs that bitcoin needs to scale to visa level through put.

But if a node has 500 transactions sitting in the mempool that were all first seen greater then 10 minutes ago, and a block comes across that includes less then 50% of them then it could reject the block or refuse to propagate it.

"Transaction fees go up. Literally, that’s all that happens. That’s the big ‘crisis’. What’s being claimed is: Transaction fees might go above two cents! The sky is falling! I am not exaggerating."
... followed by ...
" Wallets don’t support transaction fees! Yeah, and computers had to have their Y2K bugs fixed. The whole point of Bitcoin is that it’s an untrusted system where the different agents represent themselves. Pieces of software whose developers don’t make them do that should be abandoned and replaced with ones which can."
So he was exaggerating after all. Seems he doesn't get that when bitcoin software stops functioning, the economy stops and people lose money in lost consumer confidence and failed transactions.
I agree with him that it should be fixed, but that would require someone coming up with a proposal on how to actually fix it.

I like the idea of it being possible, but I really don't see any evidence that a decentralized trust-less and cheap solution to this problem (byzantine general) is going to suddenly appear. Mining works for bitcoin because its market driven. The $650 million number comes from the market cap of bitcoin, coins in circulation, and amount of new coins being produced. Doesn't matter that the mining algorithm used is, (SHA256) . What determines the size of the mining market is just the amount of coins that can be produced and the market value of those coins. If $650 million of coins is being minted into the system, then people will invest about $649 million in mining equipment to get those coins.

Im happy to answer your question, but I cant agree with the premise, because free trade really has nothing to do with ships specifically. Craigslist is a good example of free trade. Free trade is where people are able to trade with eachother directly without needing the permission from a 3rd party.
So right now when you trade money for a sandwhich, if you are using Visa, then you just went through a 3rd party that made that transaction happen for you. If you traded internationall, then you required the banks as a 3rd party to do that transfer for you, or even if you just met up with someone and handed them a bag of cash, you still are using Federal Reserve Notes which are controlled by the 3rd party, Federal Reserve Central Bank. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer, direct person to person. There is no 3rd party. So when you send someone on the other side of the world bitcoin, the exchange is direct person to person, with no bank that can block your transaction. Im sure you have more questions, but I hope that answered some of them.

It's a publicly listed project. He doesn't have to receive any tips, but what he is saying is that he doesn't want any devs to receive tips at all, and that really isn't his choice to make. The only two parties involved are the tipper, and the receiver.

Early in the comments it was shown that it's already easy to turn off email comments, and that was not sufficient for the flask dev. So you referencing this issue as being about spam is false. Actually, his complaint was about 'gamifying'. He is actually against anyone who contributed to an open source project being able to receive tips.


It's a great project. This is obviously shown by the number of git projects that have embraced it and all the developer who are signed up to receive tips on it. It would be unfortunate for it to be shutdown because of harassment from a minority, instead of the project continuing to evolve.

coin control enhances privacy by giving the user control. having the app force the user to use randomly selected inputs reduces the users control over their privacy. coin control has nothing to do with single address reuse. it is about deciding what inputs you want to use for new transactions.

i don't see your post sharing anything factual that proves it is not game changing. game changing is itself a subjective evaluation. i too think bitreserve is a valuable addition to the ecosystem. you may not like it because they haven't shown proof of reserve, and this could very well be a feature they are working to add next week. some people may value production quality video that gives them a nice feeling of a trusted brand with a familiar face they have done business with before and feel they can trust. what bitcoin is missing most is professionalism, and Halsey is doing a far better job at that then most.

I see how HD wallets could provide some of the same function, but not as fine gained as coin control.

development shouldn't determine product design. that would just be shared code. not the same UI. 


Dont put a new product into an existing app just to expand on its existing install base. Just put out the new awesome app and people will use it if it's a good product. 
Sending money and logging into a website are two different things. It would be extremely dangerous for security isolation. I would never keep my money in the same place that I have to unlock every time I log in to a website. It would also likely confuse new users who are trying to understand what bitcoin is. what about the people who just want a wallet, or just want a website login manager?

@_date: 2014-10-31 02:40:29
Same thing that happens if you delete your bitcoin private key. You start over from scratch. It is artificial and externally imposed that people would not be able to have more then one identity. To the contrary, you should be able to have an identity for every relationship, so that you can maintain privacy and anonymity between each. For the same reason that you shouldn't use the same password on all the websites you visit, you shouldn't use the same user identity either. 
Btw...people already lose their passports all the time. They also get them stolen. They apply for new ones. Same thing with SSL certificates and keys. Nothing new here.

@_date: 2015-01-28 04:42:42


Wrong, but forgivable that he doesn't get elliptic curve cryptography.


Wrong. The requirements to run a full node will increase (storage space, network bandwidth), but the difficulty of mining has nothing to do with the growth of transactions. Mining difficulty is strictly set by miner competition since it is a zero sum game.


Uh oh, I guess he doesn't know about coinapult locks and bitreserve. Volatility solved for the transactional medium.




Since it's all transparent, any manipulation would be known as soon as it were to happen. And yes, my fear of the mathematics being cracked are much less then the fear and knowledge that we are being enslaved by a small group of men who control the nations currency.
At the end he pulls out the same old sorry deflationary spiral arguments.


And then the same old arguments here.
He then goes into some weird ass historical revisionism.


At the end is where he turns from just a bad intellectual into a complete shill. Also note that his use of the word ponzi is inaccurate here, and he's essentially just arguing against bull markets.
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:52:28
bitcoin economics are identical to gold. he would have to prove gold is a pyramid scheme. (and actually gold you can possess, not that scammy naked short selling market, because you can possess your bitcoin keys too) the other perspective you can take is that IT IS a pyramid scheme, only if ALL money is a pyramid scheme, and that is ok because it provides social utility. bitcoin is better money then fiat.

In countries that accept multiple currencies, how do the shops show it to their customers? 
Also note that merchants may be choosing to display that they accept via Coinbase or via Bitpay, so they still have an actual payment processor company. And bitcoin directly is digital cash.

Here is the most accurate thing he said!
" The Crash of 2008 has infused our societies with enormous scepticism on the role of the authorities, both government and Central Banks. It is quite natural that many dream of a currency that politicians, bankers and central bankers cannot manipulate; a currency of the people by the people for the people. Bitcoin has emerged as the great white hope of something of the sort. "

bitcoin has no 'centralized FED-type entity'. Its a decentralized network. The supply is collectively regulated by the algorithm of the network.
'curb the price growth by selling reserves and buying on dumps.'  This is called a pump n dump, and it has nothing to do with a centralized fed.

Try looking at the technical aspects instead of preaching from a bleeding heart. You can't have an ideal network if you don't first have a functional network.

Everyone running a copy of bitcoin core would have to patch as well. Bitpay, coinbase, bitstamp, etc.

I tried to wean myself off, by then felt like I missed some info during a rally which caused me to possibly miss some good trades, so I doubled up instead.

They don't have the best interests in mind because they actually develop bitcoin products that are usable by the average person? Why are you against the market choosing the leaders?
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:29:00


Vague. Efficient by what measure?
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:14:17
Too bad they didn't actually show the product in the video. Just a guy holding some box.

Why should we worry? Its not like she can corrupt the blockchain. Our bitcoin is decentralized. Let them do what they will.

This is the first time I've heard of someone learning about bitcoin through that movie. Can you describe how you perceived the movie and what it was like for you?

Would make more sense to have a coinbase gift card, or have Google let you buy bitcoin with the Google play gift card.
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:08:00
Why it's a problem? You don't think creating a whole new currency for no particular reason when there is no need for it, a problem? Might as well include a kitchen sink too. Why not turn it into it's own Linux distro?

Well, the bankers and dictating class will probably change the law to support their no cash policy then.

Why can't Vitalik just work with the other core devs, like normal people do. Is he special that he needs to first develop his concepts in private and then promote them on reddit to get attention?

The main hurdle is technical. If you want to make it sexy, this is going to need to start with stupid simple UI.
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:19:17
I like what your are saying, but if you understood how broken the voting system is, you would see why it necessarily creates a 2 party system. Running in the GOP works because a 3rd party is  disadvantaged.
@_date: 2015-04-30 18:07:28
Your main mistake was bragging about bitcoin to a girl you are trying to impress. 'talked about bitcoin all dinner long.' I'm sure you just made her dripping wet.
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:08:11
As we know, they have been radically successful. Still, much more can be achieved. Payment confirmation is probably the biggest issue. Dealing with bitcoin addresses and ugly qr codes is probably next. 
We also need decentralized and non-3rd party tools to be sexy to truly bring the potential of bitcoin to the masses.

And she followed up by saying, talk to the incumbents and get then involved instead of just trying to replace them. This is likely what we will need if we want to grow market cap. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:07:57
What you said in the video was that you use florincoin because of the quick confirmation time, which everyone here knows is a bad reason because lower confirmation times don't help security, so you are better off not using confirmations at all. 
What you are trying to do will likely move to a side chain in the near future, and I think this project would be more interesting if the first 5 minutes of the video wasn't trying to pump florincoin and instead was helping push forward side chains.

Even if circle had a POS system for merchants, which they don't, do you think it would be easier and quicker then using a credit card?

Why do you need a currency at all to do decentralized data storage? Check out bitmessage.org. They are decentralized and didn't need to make a new currency for message storage.
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:09:25
I see. Thanks. Will be interesting to see this solved.

Okay, I'm listening. How does 'big money' have an advantage in a free market? Specifically here in the bitcoin market, what advantage do they have, and what type of regulation are you suggesting could help?

No. It has a limited amount. It has the property of scarcity. Scarcity is enforced by the peers of the open decentralized network which uses mathematical algorithms.
