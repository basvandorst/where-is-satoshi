Can you let me know the name of your banking partner so I can contact them directly?

That song would suit hodling more than one cryptocurrency in my opinion, but great song nonetheless.

so why was my account blocked straight after I uploaded my ID documents? I hadn't even attempted to buy any coins yet or done anything relating to fiat currency.
This is the only exchange that has done this, so this is not what "all exchanges would do".

Can Coinhouse at least delete my account since its blocked? No point especially since you claim that it cannot be unblocked.
Also how can your "banking partner" block my account if the site is run by Coinhouse and not by them?

lol "sold a bad ID pack", &lt;---- you see everyone, this is how the Coinhouse teams treats their users, getting upset, being rude and being arrogant, people should definitely stay away from this company.
By the way it is pronounced "end of story", if you're going to be rude at least learn how to say it correctly, better still don't say things you don't know the meaning of, just making yourself look childish.

Alright, noted.
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:33:15
great ideas, noted.
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:26:05
That's a good one, noted.

thanks for your response, about the inputs why would the withdrawal fee be high if I deposit a lot of times into the paper wallet? Is it related to the high balance or actual number of times deposited?
Regarding question 2, bitaddress was the generator I had in mind but you're I would be better off getting the private key from the exclusive wallets if they are available.

Alright, thank you for clearing that up.

So the best move before transferring would to be hold my coins in the exchange until I have a large amount or until I wont be buying for some time right? Does this data accumulation apply to all wallet types?
