but a few years ago when Bitcoin was at the same hashrate as BCC is now, it was secure?
Nice logic lol.

The 100 million + dead from communism would like to have a word with you.
Allowing govt to teach children and indoctrinate them to being wages slaves is far more dangerous than a few thousand nazis out of 340 million americans. Quit fighting the boogeyman. You are more likely to be hit by lightning two times than to be killed by a nazis in america.
Do any amount of basic research and look up how many nazis or racists killed someone in USA per year.
It is almost so non existent it isn't even worth talking about at all. We could save more lives per year by increasing driving safety by 1%. By getting .0001%  of smokers to quit.
The numbers are so absurdly small and neglible that for you to even bring up nazis and racists killing people just shows how uninformed you are. Do you believe every news headlines?
And by the way
 Almost all mass shootings are done by someone who illegally got a firearm AND who also has Mental Health issues.
Gg no re.

Would you care to explain how anything was a mess, when it was already known what would happen?
We all know how long difficulty takes to go down.
We all know prices and profit incentives of miners.
We all understand blocks will take longer.
It is easy to do a HF. Almost no prepartion was needed.
Nothing was bungled from what I see, as everything was pretty weel known going in to it.
Maybe you don't like the fact that things happen and need to be resolved so you call it messy?  That's on you. Bitcoin is the long game, nobody is saying Bitcoin Cash would be ready and fully operational and miners at optimial incentives on day 1 or week 1 or even month 1.

Satoshi literally said the block size needs to be increased as time goes on. Bitcoin Cash just did that.

Guy above you is basically saying "Won't somebody think of the poor miners! They need more BTC!!!"

Just call me Optimus Prime. I think we are done here.
