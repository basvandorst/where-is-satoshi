I'm assuming the scans they perform could reveal that kind of clue. The brainwallet really is a dual purpose - as much incentivizing bringing you back all mentally there as much as to recover the bitcoin.

I preferred uBTC too but I think we lost out to bits a long time ago.

People will always need to borrow and invest.

Same plan here, except btc is reward for resurection. Stored as brain wallet, which incentives restoring with some mental faculty left.

Another advantage is in reduced block propagation times. Just as an explanation (ultimate validity/theory aside) - when a miner finds a block, there is a lag from the time of finding to when other miners receive the broadcast. This means that the miner who found the block can begin working on the new chain slightly before others. Bigger blocks mean a more lag, and this leads to an advantage to the larger miners that is positive feedback. If larger miners were to collude and share block solutions before broadcasting them, this advantage could become even more significant. Small blocks are thought to reduce this risk.

But why not just drop a qr code?

At that height, youre going to have a huge calorie requirement, its no wonder youve struggled. Try the 4000 Cal as above but if that's not working then don't be afraid to up it. I found if i got to the end of a day and did not hit the minimum cal its easy to just scoop peanut butter til you hit it.

Put $20 against trump taking primaries in hopes of winning $5. New Hampshire can suck it.
