Actually not that it matters but I don’t believe that text is real either lol “how do I cash my bitcoin I want new kitchen”

This is such a lie. Lol assuming he has at least two sisters (he said sisters) he gave them a bitcoin each. He must also have one if he’s giving them away. If all this is true, we’re supposed to believe this man owns at least 3 bitcoin
I know it’s not impossible but cut the shit lol

Yeah I know that. I bought more than a bitcoin when I first got on the darkweb and prices were around $300 for one. I’m not saying it’s impossible or hard to come by but I don’t believe his story

Thanks for sharing your information! Bought Ethereum for the first time this month and it's the alt coin I chose because it's backed by big corporations. Monero is another great one to keep in mind for the future.

Where's the support for bitcoin? Wondering if I should buy now or wait till morning

Because there’s a finite amount of bitcoin doesn’t that mean price will go up in time if people keep using it? With people losing access to their wallets or leaving small traces of coin on exchanges or dark net markets.. eventually all that adds up and price will be affected, right?

I saw that website but I’m still confused. It says the average transaction is 250 bytes but how can I calculate the fees with that information. Then I see that it cost less than 50 cents to have your transaction in the next block but I thought bitcoin had a congested network and the fees were like $30. Is this not true anymore?

How much to then send from my wallet to another friend then? I left that out to be more concise but didn’t know binance has fixed fee

I’ll give it a try. I was trying to send Monero instead but it’s been 16 hours and my Monero transaction is stuck on 1/5 confirmations. Gonna start over and try with Bitcoin. Thank you.
