Ugh. As usual, they never tell us WHY miners have to solve these "complex math problems".  
Simply put, it takes a while to find the next block, but very easy to confirm it to be correct.  This creates an incentive for the miners that didn't find the current block to accept the one that was found and move on to the next.  
A miner could reject the good block and eventually find one themselves, hoping to claim the bitcoin reward.  But the rest of the network (all the other miners) have already accepted the first one and will reject the second one.

I think "300% increase" means +3.  For a total of 4 buyers. :-)

My guess is they vote to extend then deadline.
@_date: 2016-01-27 01:35:14
Yeah, I remember that too. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 23:37:19
Well, duh.

Using this method, I think the pre-Gox value would be 3.

Just sold all my bitcoin for bitcoin coin.

They may be right.  But the technology is sound.  So maybe the price should be $1000, maybe 10K, maybe we should go through another 18 month price slide first.  But the tech is sound.

TL;DR: The arguments Schiff uses against bitcoin can be even more effectively used against gold, which he constantly shills.

Your color picker skills are spot on though.

Find something from his registry that you can buy with bitcoin.  Then later tell him casually that you bought it with bitcoin.  Please, don't give a paper wallet.

Back at $4000 I posted my coinbase promo link on facebook and offered to give anyone the $10 coinbase was going to give me if they use it.  I also offered to give anyone $5 if they want.  No one took me up on it.

The hasty blow is oft astray.

Instantly converts to dollars, so no, they don't really accept bitcoin.  It doesn't matter until businesses start paying their suppliers in bitcoin.

I continue to use fold.app at Starbucks.  The 20% discount is very nice.  
@_date: 2016-02-17 02:20:52
Yeah he's a good guy.  
@_date: 2016-09-29 01:16:15
The price is very stable lately.  Maybe it will wait for you until you're ready to jump back in :-)
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:52:43
Agreed.  Going full mgtow and full stoic mode until then.

I read the first half of the first sentence of his bio, and then moved on.

Hey, that homeless guy is driving a lambo.

Bitcoin is just not the same without China banning it.

You should probably first explain what the purpose of LN is, and the problem it solves before getting it to the details.

People who think they are traders are competing against people who understand this post. So I'm not a trader.
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:22:07
Your welcome! I think going mgtow, at least for a time, is a good idea.  
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:08:51
Nice, but its a yacht.

What you're doing is correct.  Running a node is all you have to do.  
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:07:04
Replace "indicator" with "guarantee" and you got it right.  Past performance can most certainly be an indicator. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:48:38
Congrats! You're ahead of the curve, now just keep going.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:12:44
It's not "willing to lose", it's "can afford to lose".  No one is willing to lose money, that is foolish.

Trace, please stop ending your statements with ", right?". Makes you sound unsure of yourself and are asking the interviewer for confirmation.

Here's something to help you understand TX better.  It's is not necessarily a business friendly state, it's a **Texas** business friendly state.

Please don't mix logic and reason with bitcoin price predictions.

Did you offer to reimburse him for the loss?

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, 
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, 
    If all men count with you, but none too much; 
If you can fill the unforgiving minute 
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

FRB will eventually be part of the bitcoin ecosystem too.  One possible scenario: Store your coins at coinbase and then coinbase pays you interest and uses the capital to provides mortgage or auto loans.  Don't think for a minute this kind of a thing won't happen.
