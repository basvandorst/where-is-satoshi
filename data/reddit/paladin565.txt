They've been pretty friendly to me over there, but I've seen that in various coin related subs.  Everyone is so doggedly loyal to their choice of currency flavor.  There's several threads here about how Bitcoin Cash is doomed to failure and Segwit is future of all so I guess it goes both ways.  It's sometimes hard to read through the zeal and get to the meat of the information.

Thanks for the info.  For someone just getting interested in cryptocurrency in general, this sure is an interesting time with lots going on.  Will be interesting to see what happens!

To expand just a little more. If your in Texas then it may not be controversial because the damn yanks don’t know how to run a currency. While the remainder of the United States sees it as an upstart not with its time. 
Canada on the other hand wonders wtf Texas and the US are doing and wished they’d play nicer since they’re Canada and they want to do business with both. 
Sorry if that got wordy.

Yeah, the naming convention is one of those things that seems really contentious for some reason. As someone that’s not invested either community very heavily, I just don’t seem to get it. As I understand it BCH or whatever you wish to call it is a “fork“ (not sure if I’m using that term correctly) of bitcoin and copied the block chain. So as a derivative it would seem the derivative name is appropriate if used consistently. There are those that seem to want to rebrand it as “The” Bitcoin and refer to BTC as something else. 
For someone just learning about coin, it would be akin to how there’s multiple currencies called dollar. There is the US Dollar and the Canadian Dollar among others for example, and which one a person means when they say Dollar can vary, hence the need for consistency and being on the same page. This looks like a similar thing to me. The important thing is that you and the person you’re talking to both know exactly which coin or currency you’re talking about.

That's a pretty basic break down so thanks.
It sounds basically your position against Bitcoin Cash's larger block sizes is that eventually the blocks will be so big only certain entities will have the computing power in order to process them and run full nodes to support the network?
And if Bitcoin's solution to scaling is to take transactions off the blockchain, how does that effect security?  My understanding was that the chain linking of every transaction in the blockchain was considered pretty fundamental?

I can see your point, but Disney dollars would most likely only be accepted at Disney properties. 
I know my comparison isn’t an exact fit but to expand a little. 
I think of it more in terms of if Texas (because it is like a whole other country) broke off and printed “Texas Dollars” and within some circles that was “The” Dollar. And through various trade deals and all it could become fairly widely accepted. It could be exchanged for other currency like BCH can, where as Disney Dollars wouldn’t be. 
 
As for Uncle Sam Dollars, A lot of currencies do have nicknames. Greenback, buck, C-note.  And I don’t know what a squid is in England in relation to a Pound.

Hm...maybe. Like I said, very contentious.
