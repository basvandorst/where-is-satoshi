Well how can I argue with "major props" and being popular on Reddit, a bastion of articulation? I appreciate your misplaced arrogance and condescending reply, though.

Thanks for the link, looks pretty unique. I like encountering ideas new to me. I guess I'm still at a loss for why you want to include it? You face a huge problem of user education by introducing tonal numbers, which compounds the abundance of user education issues involved with bitcoin/blockchain already. Why further complicate it?

Dude, you need an editor. The level of writing on display is not on par with professional news organizations and it damages your message. Your articles are often scattered and semi-coherent. Please talk to Bitcoin.com about an editor or some kind of content manager, I think it would really help you convey your message more clearly.

You haven't answered my question. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 23:59:10
Yeah, I don't see any benefit, and I don't see how bitcoin makes this more or less possible.
@_date: 2016-02-20 00:45:03
Those are rather flimsy reasons, and I don't follow your logic at all. How much business experience do you have?
@_date: 2016-02-20 04:52:40


How? Bitcoin doesn't negate tax obligations, employees and employers have the same responsibilities with or without payments in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-20 02:55:30
What kind of business was it? Did you talk to an attorney?
@_date: 2016-02-20 15:58:59
So employees should forfeit part of their earnings in order to choose when they get paid? How does that provide a benefit? That's the same as using a short term loan or a credit card. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 04:20:54
Yeah, I'm familiar with money velocity, thanks. I'm saying this change wouldn't increase money velocity. Consumers needs aren't changing as a result of being paid more often, they wouldn't suddenly go grocery shopping every day instead of once a week.

If you don't know enough to say what the costs are, how do you know what the costs are? How do you know that bitcoin will help mitigate these costs? 
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:49:06
So what is the benefit of being paid daily?
@_date: 2016-02-20 02:57:08
What harm is this doing to employees? Why would an employee want to be paid daily? 
@_date: 2016-02-20 03:00:52
10/15/30 day terms doesn't mean the money is sitting idle. That seems to be your underlying assumption, and since that is inaccurate I think your argument falls flat. Even if that were the case, planning wouldn't change as a result of daily payments. It would increase complications rather than minimizing, I would think. It creates daily work, especially if bitcoin is being used. I really don't see how this benefits anyone, and I especially don't see how bitcoin is the answer to this supposed problem. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 23:18:02

@_date: 2015-11-11 21:29:52
That's a rather dramatic rhetorical response. It's also dishonest to say all the benefits accrue to the bankers. Interest rates are low, and I personally have a mortgage with a very favorable rate, which saves me thousands. I have a car loan at .9%, which lets me get to work and costs me very little extra. The largest banks are publicly held, which means anyone can buy their stock and benefit from the money they make. I think your drama is less about facts and more about your world view. 
Also, what's the recent inflation rate for the dollar?  
@_date: 2015-11-11 21:07:22


Bank notes don't require the internet, or an electronic device, or wallets, software, apps, etc. How is bitcoin more portable?


That's wishful thinking. Saying it is so, doesn't make it so. 


Yes and no. You're limiting banks to a narrow view of the functions financial institutions fulfill. A central component of what modern banks do is providing trust. As counter parties, as a third parties, as holders of physical assets, etc. Regarding fractional banking, how do you think it started in the first place? Bitcoin is no impediment to fractional banking. Fractional banking simply functions too well, and provides too many benefits to be abandoned.

@_date: 2015-11-11 23:37:46
Inflation is correlated with purchasing power more closely than money supply, M3. The answer you avoided giving is that inflation is minimal, less than a full percent in 2014. Rather than trying to make this appear like a government conspiracy to not publish data, you could be honest and say that inflation hasn't been an issue lately.

@_date: 2015-11-14 16:49:04
His political views get in the way of his arguments. Talking about hacks and then Portugal and Greece as though they are reasons to not have private blockchains is both confusing and illogical. Banks and start-ups are pouring money into distributed ledgers for good reasons; they'll be valuable to banks and traders. 
@_date: 2015-11-01 15:22:37
Why would derivatives collapse because of a small increase to the rate at which the reserve loans money to banks? Besides which, derivatives aren't pure risk, they can be, and are used as a hedge for risk. A well planned portfolio will include seemingly contradictory contracts as hedges for dramatic shifts. But none of this would cause the federal reserve to collapse. Can you explain why that would happen because of derivatives?
@_date: 2015-11-11 15:27:11
Why is it that anyone involved in bitcoin assumes that anyone who *doesn't* want to be involved in bitcoin doesn't understand the technology? Banks have different needs, and will tailor the technology to their needs. Just like any other industry. They aren't subverting bitcoin, they're averting aspects they don't need or want. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 19:44:04
I should have added "yet" to the end of that sentence. I think bitcoin will get to the point that it is a robust settlement layer. I don't think its there yet.

I thought the Economist article hit it on the head. Distributed ledgers have broad implications for any transaction that requires trust. Bitcoin is the first iteration, but is not necessarily the best or most useful.

@_date: 2015-10-25 16:19:18
Because QE isn't "printing money". It's a swap for bonds with reserves. It may increase bond yields slightly, but there isn't a change to the amount of money in the economy. 
Since incomes haven't increased, inflation is flat. Without increased income leading to increased spending, there is no increase in inflation. 
Bitcoin hasn't increased in value because there is zero evidence to correlate bitcoin price movements with any traditional market movements. There is zero evidence linking bitcoin prices with anything, actually. No observer *actually* knows why the bitcoin price is moving as no one has the information necessary to answer "why". 
@_date: 2015-11-11 15:34:15
No, it's about the technology. Bitcoins are a token used to incentivize hashing to ensure security. This is not the only way to accomplish security for a blockchain. Private users will have different needs, and can use different schemes. 
By suggesting that every start-up should invest in bitcoin, and altcoins should be discouraged, you're suggesting that what we have now is the best and only option, and that future innovation isn't desirable. That's plain stupid. Bitcoin isn't a robust settlement layer, and it isn't even close to being "money". Limiting the advancement of the technology isn't going to increase adoption. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 01:45:39
That's not what we're talking about. What we're talking about is mentioned in that article, as price inflation. Monetary inflation may cause price inflation, which is why I asked what the rate of inflation has been recently. 
You continue to dodge the answer that inflation, as in tangible, actual price inflation, isn't occurring at an alarming rate. Likely because that reality undercuts your other arguments. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 01:52:42
But earlier you said most dollars are directed at stocks? So are dollars sent overseas, or are they directed at stocks? How are you logically linking increases in tuition and "health care markets" to the money supply? Do you have any evidence to show inflation is occurring in "health care markets"? 
I can't summon the energy to argue the rest of your nonsense, it's regurgitated crap you read on Zero Hedge I'm sure.

Thanks for the &gt; tip, I don't use Reddit much. 


No, you're not understanding local demand versus new demand. If I'm buying regularly on Circle, and then shift my buying to LB, it isn't new demand. It's new demand local to LB. No new money is entering the ecosystem. 


It's like you skimmed the Wikipedia article for "Economics" and feel like you "got the gist of it" but really you're a bit mixed up.
No, you just don't understand the topic well. Volume in this instance would be similar to price, because volume is a function of price. It's like an order book on an exchange, as the the bid/ask converge, volume increases, making it functionally similar to price in this narrow view. You keep saying *demand*, but that's not what you're talking about. Again, because you don't seem to know what you're talking about. 


Yeah, I'm really puzzled about why you're so condescending. 


So you don't know, and lack the ability to define it in real terms. That means you aren't arriving at conclusions based on evidence.

This is another innovative product that uses the trust inherent to a blockchain. This is the future for blockchains, it's great to see it being used. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:45:44
A couple concerns come to mind. In some nations the graphs show a huge change in total volume, but in terms of dollars it may be only a few thousand. Is that one person buying, a couple people? Is that person new to bitcoin, or simply buying on LB rather than another method? 
In nations where the volume is rising, is that the same people buying more bitcoin because of increased faith in bitcoin? Or is it new buyers? How many of the buyers are new vs old? Are the buyers looking to actively spend bitcoin, or simply invest?
There is too little information available to imply that this equates to adoption. There isn't even a definition of "adoption" in this sense. How can we infer statistically that adoption is occurring if we haven't defined adoption in some meaningful, and specific way?
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:52:51
If pedantic to you means "Conclusions actually based on data", sure, call it that. 
These graphs don't show adoption. They don't show the total number of unique traders. They don't show month over month change in the number of unique traders. These graphs don't show demand, either. Is the increased volume due to a narrowing of LB pricing and exchange pricing? Is the volume due to wash trading like Chinese exchanges? We don't know, based on these charts. They simply show volume. Call it whatever you want, but you're pulling conclusions out of what you believe, rather than what the data supports.

@_date: 2015-10-18 22:30:15
You're incorrect about both of those stipulations. 
Digital money can be "used" without KYC/AML, go buy something on a vendor that accepts BTC. There are notable events that do require companies to collect information to meet KYC/AML regulations
And cash does require regulation to transmit, store, etc. depending on the circumstances. It depends on the amount, where you are moving it to/from, and who is receiving it.

Thankfully what people believe isn't the same as what people know. 
If someone posed the question "Do you know for a fact that Chinese speculation drove Gox prices up during the 2013 bubble?" it would be dishonest for likely anyone to say yes. 
My issue with your statements is that you seem to have a strong interest in spreading the idea that Chinese interest is this huge force in the bitcoin economy, but you have no evidence to back that assertion. This suggests to me that your motive is less than honest. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:10:05
The charts report increased volume, they offer no information on who is doing the trading. I see no data about the total number of people involved in trading. Where in the data are you seeing "more people"?

This is more ideological babble. Banks are larger now than they were before the most recent crisis. Most just released earnings, and they did quite well.

Financial middlemen serve a purpose. The current method of payment and exchange isn't random. Middlemen add value by sharing risk, acting as a hedge, guaranteeing payments, etc. Bitcoin won't negate the services they provide. P2P has limited usefulness in finance because it isn't a superior way of doing business. 


The post office isn't terrible at what it does. The main reason the Postal Service is struggling are the constraints placed on them by Congress, specifically republicans who want to hamstring the post office.

If this proves to be true, that bitcoin can mirror the properties of gold, wouldn't a tokenized system of gold that can be digitally transmitted and verified be superior since gold benefits from being the first mover?

|Regardless of the specific number of people, it shows demand where previously there was none. That's the point.
No, it doesn't. You're assuming that. The data doesn't demonstrate that. The demand is simply new to LB, not new to the bitcoin ecosystem. You're making things up. 
|It doesn't matter. Not one wit. It's still demand where previously there was none. That's the point.
It really does matter. It also doesn't mean "demand", it means volume exchanged. Volume exchanged is a function of demand and supply intersecting, which could be a result of increased supply which depressed the price, or lots of other variables. You're using demand incorrectly. The graphs only show successful trades, there is no data about total demand, or change in demand. 
|This is funny. "What even is adoption, man?" 
Could you define adoption in this context, then?
@_date: 2015-10-26 01:06:38






No. You're throwing buzz words and generics. The fact that it is this hard to cite a single specific use case illustrates my point. The competitive edge of bitcoin doesn't exist today.

Bitcoin isn't "sovereign money", that's not an actual thing. Bitcoin is already regulated in many places, and exchanges like Gemini and Coinbase are working with governments to establish rules for bitcoin. 
Most people are not interesting in bypassing government or having "sovereign money", they want to buy things easily, and save money. If bitcoin goes mainstream it will be because it solves a mainstream problem.

Ok, possibly. We're talking a .25% increase to the interest rate, though. It may not shift mortgage rates that much. 


wat. You just said mortgages won't get signed, how can there be derivatives tied to mortgages that don't exist?


Double wat. I'm not sure how the crisis was papered over, could you explain that further? Fannie and Freddie were created as government organizations. Not sure how the government takes over itself. Got a source for the liabilities extant now versus the crisis? 


They never stopped. Poor people need homes too. That's just a buzzword, though. Sub-prime doesn't mean crisis, it means extra risk. Risk can be managed. 


Wat. Source?

@_date: 2015-10-25 23:45:22


Got it. 


This is where it starts to fall apart. One source of revenue for newspapers was the sale of classified ads. Craigslist didn't dominate this space overnight, it took years. This was the time in which newspapers had to adapt. Some have, some still are, some failed. It didn't leave "no room", that's an exaggeration. 


Again, it isn't impossible. It still exists, papers still sell classified ads. The internet diluted the revenue stream. You're exaggerating the point. 


What middleman are you referencing? You think *all* middlemen will disappear because of bitcoin? Suddenly all of society will start driving to farms to buy individual amounts of groceries instead of using a middleman like a grocer? That's illogical and inefficient.


I'm assuming businesses that do well hire smart people to help them keep doing well. In this case, the banks are doing well and will likely continue to do so. The use case for having banks is much stronger than the use case for bitcoin.

Zero evidence offered to support your title. This is blind cheerleading. This is nonsense.

I stopped using Cryptsy because they have some issues, but calling their actions criminal seems like a stretch. This seems like a petty response by a user who didn't want to provide their information.

What do banks censor?
Darkweb, great, criminal activity. Probably not a strong use case. 
Capital controls evasion. Any evidence that this is actually occurring? I have yet to see any evidence that any group has used bitcoin for this purpose. 
Wikileaks...is that actually a use case? 
You keep repeating "permissionless value transfer". That doesn't mean anything to the average person. If you can't explain the point in simple language to joe schmoe, you can't sell it to them.

I've read it previously, it's old.

Nothing better than making up statistics to make you feel superior. 85% of people agree.

I dunno, but that impressive display of pedantry is basically what I'm talking about. This sub is a cesspit. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 16:51:00
Is this a serious comment?
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:43:42
Afterward, all discussion of the coins would be deemed "off topic" and censored.

You're cherry picking, and it isn't a good argument. 
Good companies and large organizations stay on top by innovating and adapting. Newspapers were slow to adapt to the internet. GM has been slow in adapting in many ways, notably pick-up trucks and manufacturing methodology. Blockbuster missed the boat on Netflix and leveraging the internet. 
There is nothing to suggest banks are being taken by surprise by bitcoin. Most of them are involved in some venture related to bitcoin or blockchains. They're typically run by very smart people. They'll innovate and adapt, possibly integrating blockchain technology into their business model if it is beneficial. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 16:06:34
No it isn't. If bitcoin becomes important enough it will simply be co-opted into the system of financial institutions that exist today. Most likely, bitcoin will continue to be marginally important, and generally ignored. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 19:33:27
I'm not seeing the use case based on the picture. What are you saying bitcoin can help with?

Does mpesa have KYC/AML requirements? 
@_date: 2015-10-25 17:01:01
A blog from a VC who invested in bitcoin, and bitcoin companies should explain why bitcoin is undervalued? 
If you can't answer the question maybe that suggests there isn't a good answer. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 02:15:35
It's not surprising that bitcoin is used by criminals, it makes sense. It also isn't surprising that law enforcement wants to limit technology that criminals are using. Bitcoin needs to find a use case that generates positive publicity rather than suspicion. 
@_date: 2015-10-26 00:36:37
That doesn't mean anything. What innovation. What problem with this innovation solve? What "usefulness"? Saying buzzwords doesn't make it true. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:17:49
Look at the answers you've received here, they are all saying or implying that *anyone* who doesn't think bitcoin is great is stupid and/or uneducated. 
The bitcoin community does a great job of being elitist assholes to anyone with different opinions. No wonder most people enjoy rooting against bitcoin.

Absolutely 0 evidence about Chinese "outflows". This is nonsense.

How is this topical to @_date: 2015-10-26 03:10:34
Yes. You should be able explain the value proposition in a couple of clear, concise sentences without using buzzwords.

You're caught in the echo chamber. It isn't a conspiracy that relegates Austrian economics to the margin, it's the majority opinion of rational, educated professionals. Places like ZH and this sub demonize anyone who thinks with the mainstream because to accept the mainstream ability to be rational and logical undermines marginal opinions, like yours. People aren't "sheep" because they disagree. Maybe they came to different conclusions for valid, logical, empirical reasons. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 17:02:43
Yeah, I think I will pass on your scam, I mean "bank".
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:42:32
This analysis isn't bad, it just isn't driven by evidence. How can anyone correlate variables with bitcoin price movement when there is zero hard evidence available? It's all speculation.

So, because this is in Africa the people must be unbanked and lack access to financial services?

Yeah, I had withdrawal issues with them over a year ago. They are definitely not impressive as an exchange.

Though it isn't the focus of the article, it will be interesting to see what banks end up doing with distributed ledgers.

KYC/AML isnt going to disappear because of bitcoin. This doesn't seem like a post that contributes anything of value. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:31:05
You probably aren't getting that vibe because you're in the echo chamber, and you agree with the echoes. 
@_date: 2015-10-26 02:31:33
It literally quotes an expert in the article as saying “The banking situation needs to be solved. I don’t think bitcoin is the solution,”
At least read the article before posting it.

He doesn't really address private blockchain implications, or offer comparison with bitcoin. The video was way more focused on his opinion of the financial system and how bitcoin is different.

Why is there a market need for a trustless, decentralized, open source digital currency? Not a political reason, not your ideology. What is the competitive market reason?


This is all nonsense. The majority of development is closed source. Every line in this paragraph is ideological nonsense. This is more of what you *believe* rather than what is actually occurring.


Why? What is the compelling competitive reason for this?
