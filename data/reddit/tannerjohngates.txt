I've sold lottery tickets to many (at an establishment not like fake shady ones lol) and man, if they just wisely invested that money instead. sad. Marshmallow test is real.

It can be used the same way cash can be used. However, bitcoin block chain is an open ledger. Anyone that has someones wallet address,  (ex. if you paid them so you'd need the address to do it) can see all there transaction history and 'follow the trail' of transactions. The difficulty is in proving who the wallet address belongs to because you can have as many as you want in theory. AML regulations are keen when it comes to laundering, structuring and placement. Every major bank complies to monitor unusual transactions. Crypto wallets.. make you YOUR OWN BANK.

For casual DCA investing, either will work. If you're spending significant amounts, then you need to DYOR and figure the math from each. Try with very small buys and extrapolate the long term numbers.

This seems logical, yes. However, I do wonder: Some say BTC to \~$1,000,000 because of this, being a factor, of many. OK. What about BTC going to \~$1,000,000,000,000. Hypothetically, what would that be like?

fk all that. This is what I use: [ They have, almost clingy, customer service to the point that they'll implement suggestions within a week! It's free to use. They offer packages for tax purposes also though.

no, IF there is a balance on the ledger. sorry. i didnt math.
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:01:18
hypothetically, all of the above happens, the final balance from the ledger is transferred to a newly initialized ledger, not restored, new, and never touched after. Is there then still a way to know who is in possession? Not trying to be shady, genuinely curious.

No he wants fiat he gets fiat. It's good for wiping your face at least. Can't do that with Bitcoin! boom!

I do both and more: 401k gets 5% of my income, RH stocks gets 2%, Cashapp BTC gets 2% and Acorns is the change jar that goes into whichever seems best at the time of withdraw. Good luck to ya. Not financial advice.

holy shit, that's eventually plausible! I'm not gay but 20 sats is 20 sats.

Acorns 'aggressive' portfolio returns only 5% if you are lucky. All of the above beat that, for now.

I first saw on twitter that the iOS10 jailbreaker was mining and stacking ETH. No clue what it was. I figured he had a good reason and I then 'hit the books'.

Yes to all of the above. It only works because of everyone who thinks it works. Basically it's the same thing as saying "No one goes there anymore; it's too crowded."

There are two different options once verified. There's 'Sell' (cashout) and then under your CashApp wallet address below it is Withdraw (send).

Bitcoin invoices instead of Bitcoin addresses. That's a genius way of thinking about it! I didn't.. now I will. Thanks!

I saw it too, (lol like Pennywise), I wonder if some poor sap paid or the  wallet holder spoofed his own transaction so it looks like that people are paying so 'you' probably should too. 
I went through my passwords, the password 'uncovered' was only used for my SoundCloud and MyFitnessPal I tried to reply to congratulate the low life and beg that he not modify my YourMomsHousePodcast playlist, rejected email of course..
