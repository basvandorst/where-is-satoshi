You can get wire transfer from Bistamp? My transaction is stuck nearly 3 weeks.

I know. Hopefully I can get an account somehow.

Somebody posted on here a few days ago and got attention. I posted on coinbase last week and no reply.

I sold coin and it was supposed to be in my bank, and another in paypal.  The bank ones said money would be "Available instantly".

Upvote if you'll invest in a coin/cryptocurrency team which will discover how to create the first crypto that is 100% independent from FIAT (I'm not saying to banish FIAT-Crypto trading, that would be silly), I am saying to have a choice so people with no money can join crypto and also so we can more break away from the FIAT systems.  I think if someone can think of a way to make it work it would become highly successful. Hopefully we can do it!
p.s. I no longer look at these dips and even if the whole market crashed (it would suck) 80% as the end of the world.  I've only been around a few months but you get used to it. I Just look at past years charts and it calms me.

I decided that 40% of it, I'm not selling. 40% of it I'm reinvesting in other cryptos/investments (this is a few years down the road when BTC is 500k/coin). 5% I'm going to donate to some cause I believe in, and 15% I'm going to enjoy life with.

I decided that I am not going to sell about 40% of it, ever.  I still don't know much about BTC, or how many prominent people see it going to 500k/btc.  I just knew that it was a great investment opportunity (why hold it in my bank, and lose 1.5% a year vs. hold it in bitcoin and gain 5x, 10x, 20x per year?) No brainer.
But the more I learn, the more I choose to see that Bitcoin (not just cryptocurrencies in general) is not speculative and that the CEO/founders of TOP cryptos are all agreeing that bitcoin is a "storage of wealth".  Imagine instead of sending 1 million of something, you send 1 BTC to pay for a house?  Much more convenient.  
I think keeping a portion of BTC is a good idea, and like you said, never selling it.  I still swing trade it though, but that's just to build more BTC.

K. Lol. I am finding trading against BTC is only for very, very good traders, so I am likely to trust this comment. Thanks.

Number are liable to change, but the main parts that I learned are that it's best to NEVER sell a portion of your BTC (sure, it's still speculative today, but in 3 years it will be much more popular and most people will consider you very privelaged if you have ONE bitcoin).
And that giving away 5% of it is a good thing, because I am grateful for what it has given me and to be able to help others is very important.  
Ideally, I'd like to work with crypto strategizers/investors/innovators and create a blockchain technology to help bring more financial freedom to all.  Financial freedom to me means, being secure in the amount of resources we have for basic and things we need to enjoy life, and also the freedom from being addicted to making money (i.e. if someone would double their net worth in a very short amount of time and then want to double it again, and then again, and then again, allthewhile their level of happiness/joy doesn't increase - this to me isn't "freedom").  So bringing Financial Freedom to others is one part - bringing the amount of assets to enjoy life, including basic needs, and do what we want, and two, allowing the emotional/mental energy we have for other things like passion and vision/mission for EVERYbody.

I thought about it, because I am a small time person, so cashing out 1btc is no problem, but what if I had 100 btc? Or 1,000? IF/When BTC reaches 500k (surely, you see by now that it can reach 50k at least), then who has the FIAT currency to pay that out? 
We can say that Bitcoin is PRICED at a certain number, but if there is not that much money in the world, nor people who are Willing/able to pay for it, then (not spreading FUD because I believe in BTC) but then the price wouldn't be real.  
I know we are all making this up as we go along, and new services will come into play, especially when governments start getting involved in digital assets.  An asset can appreciate 1000x so these are good questions. GL!
