It charges are flat fee at first (about $3 per purchase below $200) and then a 1.5% fee above 200 if you use bank transfer (which takes a week) or 4% on card (instant). I think it is a 1.5% fee and instant if you use the USD wallet online they provide so that's an option but I didn't look into it.

I'm not anywhere significant yet but eventually I hope to be�� I might use a paper wallet though. thanks

What did you go with? I want to use one as well. Does gdax have a place to temporarily store them?

Did you ever figure it out? I need to cancel a purchase too but not as severe reason as you. I don't want to overdraft either and was locked out of my coinbase account (wtf) so I can't just sell them when they arrive. I have to cancel it so I called my bank and they said they'd take care of it hopefully.

Do you know if there's a fee to transfer from gdax to coinbase and back? I might buy/sell from gdax and then keep it safe in coinbase. How hard is that? Thanks

Im a noob but I'm interested in this and doing research.
So gdax vs coin base. There is an outrageous fee in coin base but I haven't used gdax yet since I heard it's confusing. Can someone do a basic rundown on differences, I know they are related/same company.
 How safe are they? Can I store my bitcoins in gdax? I currently have some in coin base. I read it's recommended not to keep them there but I'd prefer it online since it's not that much. 
Could I buy them from gdax for low rate, transfer to coin base for wallet that's safer (is that free) and then transfer back to gdax to sell? Is it easy to sell and how long does it take to buy/sell through bank transfer, coin base takes days.

Ruined it for me. Took too long, extremely high fee, and horrible support made me sell since I didn't want to move it and too stressful. You guys can enjoy Bitcoin but I can't, it was wild while it lasted though.

So it was 95 to move them to gdax and free to sell? I'm not that familiar with gdax but makers pay no fee and takers pay .25% correct? What was the price per bitcoin when you sold?

Okay so what about if I deposit usd into the gdax account. Is it the same fee and does that make transfers faster? Also is coinbase safe for under 500$? How hard is it to buy/sell from gdax honestly. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:44:31
I thought gdax was quicker but maybe I misread, I think that involves depositing money into the account. Where do you keep it safe? Is coinbase safe for under $500? I'll probably go for paper wallet eventually
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:17:03
You sold it all? I'm curious how much per Bitcoin and where? That's a hefty fee if you used coinbase but you were probably smart enough not to. Congrats man that's all awesome though.

Okay I stopped the payment after it processed but not complete so it might be different. I hope it works out though and they don't make a big deal, thanks
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:27:21
I have some in coinbase, for now since I'm small can I buy from gdax, store in coinbase since it seems safe, then transfer to gdax to sell? Is there a fee for transfer a? Coinbase takes too long for Bank transfers, is gdax quick in terms of buying and selling. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:21:16
Thats an awesome explanation thanks a lot and nice username lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:15:29
Can you explain what happened. Believe it or not I want to cancel my purchases but they won't respond. I bought at a decent price and its only going up. It was supposed to arrive saturday, bought sunday night. Chase doesn't like bitcoin so if I can get them to cancel it thats good. Does your bank stop the payment or does it not go through at all. I need Coinbase to cancel it now. Does coinbase say it will arrive then say cancelled?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:38:31
Okay that's great, if you still have the btc it's worth a good amount now so I hope it works out for you. I'm a little screwed but it's not a huge amount just disappointed and stressed (I hate waiting and dealing w tech support) how long did they take to respond to you?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:54:50
I have a noob question but seriously in a pickle.
I bought Bitcoin, took too long to get through, never verified my coinbase account, long story short I can't buy or sell and don't want to have to deal with their shit support. 
I had unauthorized purchases by them so I called my bank, filed a dispute reverse the transfer, and it passed. It shouldn't hurt them since the btc price went up so idk why they would care. Anyways will coinbase care or chase my account. I want to close the account soon enough once I can confirm the unauthorized transactions are cancelled. Will coinbase cancel it if the bank rejects it? Will they keep trying to get the money? It's in their favor to not take it anyways. 
How does the entire process work? Also how long does it take usually for coinbase support to respond? I'm gonna wait this out hopefully.
