I told my family to invest in Bitcoin back in2011? They laughed in my face.
Reading the comments makes me realize that normal people constantly are at struggle with idiots and recieve their misplaced blame. Fuck that shit man I almost wouldn't even be mad if people like that were labeled so you wouldn't have to deal with them saying " but what is Bitcoin anyways how does it have value? It's a scam you're dumb" In 2019 after I explained it more than half a decade ago when it was sub 50$
Do you think they invested in etherium when I mentioned it back in 2017? Lol.
Nope still don't have any clue even though those are the only things I've ever told them to invest in. Jokes on them I haven't worked since I was 18 still driving tht clean whip they said id have to sell.
Imagine if your sister cared as much as you?
