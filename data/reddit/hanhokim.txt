I am sorry but arbitrage profit with foreign currency is illegal in here. I have to tell the purpose of the money when I transfer lots of money abroad at once. That is why there are lots of kimchi premium(Korea premium).

No not at all. The 'shutting down' announcement is only came from the Ministry of Justice. In my country, law cannot be passed without congress's agreement by majority rule. Not same as China. And today, after minister's announcement, lots of members of congress raged against the statement. 
Even presidential office (Blue House) officially said "There is no consensus about shutting down, it is just one of many views".

1) Yes it is super booming in here. I think around 15~20% of Koreans have invested in crypto currency. Koreans really like investing something. The trading volume of Korean stock derivatives market was biggest in the world from 2000~2010.
2) They prefer altcoins compared to bitcoin.

Thank you. Actually, many foreigners think that Bithumb or Coinone is biggest exchange in here, but it is not true. The game has been changed long time ago. Exchange named 'Upbit' which uses Bittrex's system and API has much huge trading volume than Bithumb or Coinone (coinmarketcap.com cannot tell the volume because Upbit doesn't have any public API). And Upbit's main selling point is that it has a lot of alt coins on their list, so many Koreans are getting more interests on altcoins as Upbit's growth. 
I think Altcoin's volatility is another reason. Koreans love high-risk, high-return investments.

No there is no way. Korean government ban foreigner from trading on crypto exchanges last month, so every exchanges are checking whether the user is Korean or non-Korean right now. That is another reason for the Korean premium in the price. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:11:56
It is not true. Bithumb(exchange mentioned here) officially announced about this rumor. It was just a regular examination.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:50:55
Yes correct. Exchange can still be shut down if they are found to be doing fraud or avoid taxes something like that. Avoiding taxes is significant illegal thing in here too.

It seems they artificially make the price not less than 0.1 BTC. There are more than 4000 BCH buying orders between 0.09~0.1 price (It is about 400BTC worth).

You can control your margin if you want(Maximum is set by exchanges normally, but minimum is not). Margin is not a requirement of future contract. just an option.

South Korean Government's decision system is way different from Chinese. Only way to illegalize something is issuing law proposal, and then accepted by 299 congress members(majority rule).
Law proposal is also kind of competition, which means, a law 'let's shut down all exchanges' has to compete with other laws like 'let's increase welfare budget'. IMO, Majority of congress members don't have any idea about legalizing(or ilegalizing) crypto coins and they don't believe it has high priority to think about right now.
And S.Korea's congress is consisted of multi-parties(Not like China's one party system). Every party has different interests. Some party speak voice of companies, some party speak voice of low-income people... so the issuing laws which can make normal company shut down, is very debatable issue in this country. Historically, these kind of laws only occured when the company actually harming innocent citizens(like selling uncensored food..) or their properties. Bitcoin exchange itself doesn't harm anybody. So it will not be accepted by majorities.
Besides, even if everyone in congress want to ban, the process(proposal to review to act) usually takes a year and every citizens(even 8 year old boy) can watch the process. So sudden shut down announcement(like China) is unrealistic. So please don't sell your coins with fear!
ps. Banning ICO is different. We already has a law of banning company fund raising with unauthorized securities(so the government didn't need to make the whole making law process), and recently there were lot of real phonzi scam examples(like 'CoalCoin') in Korea pretending like ICO, and they really harmed many innocent people.

12-15% is just historical ratio of trading volume in a day. Majority of chinese people are hodlers(not day traders), thus we can't calculate 'how much' they have actually.

Is it just wallet? Then you should move your coins to exchange for buy/selling. Wallet and Exchange are different.

Usually, when you transfer more than $0.2m between one country to other, government treat it as a gift or inheritance and cost you a gift tax, not just transfer fee. And it costs huge. I tried the arbitrage trading when there was a gap between my country(Korea) and US before, and in my calculation, it would be profitable only when the price gap is more than about 20%. If you want to make an arbitrage gain with less than about $0.1m, than it would be fine maybe.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:14:15

I am from Korea, and I used to work at US, and I both have account on US exchange and Korea exchange. I tried arbitrage when there was a huge gap between Korea and US about more than 20%, but actually it was not that much profitable. Because to make it arbitrage, I have to send fiat cash via bank's transfer system(buy BTC with USD --&gt; send BTC to Korea --&gt; sell BTC in KRW --&gt; change KRW to USD --&gt; "Send USD to US Account" --&gt; buy BTC with USD...) , but transfer fee costs a lot!
And I had to declare both Korea and US Customs about use of that much big money, and they charged me a tax!
In conclusion, it will not be profitable unless the gap is more than 40% I think..
