Infrastructure collapse doesnt do well for bitcoin.

Great for gold, silver, bullets, and gas!
Say what you will... bitcoin is fragile when you consider that its wholly dependent on electricity, internet, and devices to work.

A scenario where worldwide outages of power, a hypothetical "Skynet" collapse or other similar situation contains too many assumptions to seriously consider.
I can, however, attempt to describe a scenario where Bitcoin serves no purpose to their owners. Imagine a scenario slightly worse than some of the natural disasters that we are all somewhat familiar with, but slightly worse. Like The Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans, but worse infrastructure, and a worse response time by government. Or a massive earthquake that knocks out power. The siege of Stalingrad, during WW2, but with the enemy forces taking away electricity. Mad Max, but more believable. Venezuela, but their president restricted the power grid, etc etc
Whichever of these that work for you is fine. The important factors are limited resources, little infrastructure, and no electricity. In periods where the owner of Bitcoin cannot access the internet, or loses power to devices that can, tangible bartering tokens serve far more effective. Gold, food, weapons, anything tangible will be good for exchange regardless of functionality of electronic devices.
In terms of these, Bitcoin holds many of the same weaknesses as digital fiat. Hell, if you meet for a craigslist buy and you don't have a damn signal, you can't complete the deal, Venmo, Paypal, Zelle, Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. You forgot to charge your phone last night and it dies during the day? Can't pay anyone bitcoin for that sudden pickle that you're in till it's charged, or you enter your credentials into someones machine.
I'm a fan of Bitcoin. I believe in it's core technology (the parts I understand anyway) and believe it is the future. This doesn't mean that Bitcoin is better than every store of value, or bartering token in EVERY way. And in this particular way, I stand by my claim that it is relatively fragile. It has a bottleneck that requires electricity, infrastructure, and internet on a working device to work.
And if we think about that "one step further" in terms of dystopian futures, all of them minus cyber punk fail to let crypto survive. If we get to a point where we're a spacefaring species, transactions in bitcoin, or species wide currency become impractical.

I feel fine because I only put in what I can afford to lose.

The Laser Disk was out for a long time before DVDs... VHS won out for a long time.

Cant sleep, so I think I worked out the math. **a coin that size would only contain 43.31g of gold**
Density of Gold = 19.32g/cm^3
Volume of cylinder = area*height
Diameter of coin = 35mm = 3.5cm  
3.5cm/2 =radius
(pi)r^2 = area of circle
(3.14...)(1.75cm)^2 = 9.6211....cm^2
(9.62cm^2 ) (height) = volume
(9.62cm^2 ) (.233cm) = ~2.242cm^3
(2.242cm^3 ) (density) = mass
(2.242cm^3 ) (19.32g/cm^3 ) = **43.31g of gold**
I'm glad I remember how to do this from chemistry/physics from 6 yrs ago...

Heya, thank up there. Hes the one who caught it
