Ok then.  You should go and create a bet for that.  Hurry, though. You only have a few hours.

People can tip me here if they want to demonstrate the different things you can tip.

Another reason to use Betmoose.
@_date: 2014-09-07 18:24:52
There's also an [end of the month bet]( if you want something that's a little easier to predict.
@_date: 2014-09-07 20:44:33
It wasn't meant to be a ringing endorsement.  It was meant to be a counter argument to an unfounded criticism.
@_date: 2014-08-03 00:28:57
Agreed.  I think it is fine for them to set it as a stretch goal.  It just makes a good bet.

Let's bet on it:

There certainly is a trust requirement, but there's no evidence I've ever seen that BetMoose is the least bit shady.  Most of the bets over there are not related to the price of Bitcoin, so I think of it more as a way to bet on random things that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

I haven't heard anything about bitbet.  What are people saying?
@_date: 2014-09-09 04:30:47
The terse wording on that bet is my fault.  There's a comment section on each bet where you can ask the host to elaborate if you think more details are needed.
@_date: 2014-09-30 04:44:38
Technically I guess they could, but that hardly seems practical.
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:13:25


No, it isn't.
@_date: 2014-09-07 18:22:40
For fun.  Do I need another reason?
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:29:06
I recommend [BetMoose]( if you want to bet BTC on sporting events.
@_date: 2014-09-29 05:09:55
Use [BetMoose]( instead.  It isn't run by an asshole who rejects bets at random.
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:54:09
You can bet on it here:

Anyone is welcome to offer their own higher odds on this bet.

I think Xapo will back down on the fees to prevent a PR disaster.  [Who wants to bet on it?](
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:17:44


Yes.  If the word "Bitcoin" is mentioned on stage in any context, the bet resolves as Yes.  Saying something similar like "cryptocurrency" does not count, though.
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:14:10
FYI, you can bet on the success of the Storj crowdsale [here]( and [here](

[What are you willing to bet?.](
@_date: 2014-10-01 20:24:46


In all fairness, many early Bitcoin adopters have already become millionaires.  Scientologists, Ron Paul supporters, and conspiracy theorists are all fucking crazy, of course, but Bitcoin is just a tech that doesn't care who uses it.
@_date: 2014-09-19 04:32:07
Just guessing is for pussies.  Go over to [Betmoose]( and put some money behind it.
@_date: 2014-09-07 17:50:20
You should create a [bet on BetMoose](
@_date: 2014-07-03 04:53:07
[Anybody care to bet on this?](
@_date: 2014-06-15 18:05:17
You should make a [bet]( on it.

@_date: 2014-07-21 02:36:53
Thanks.  That is pretty concerning.
@_date: 2014-10-01 20:19:05
Fucking millions!
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:19:49
If you like "prediction" betting, I'm a fan of [BetMoose](  bitbet.us also seems good.

You shoud also create "contract" for this on [BetMoose](
@_date: 2014-09-06 04:34:26
[Betmoose]( has a similar bet.

Thanks.  A 10th of a HJ.  Is that like one stroke?
