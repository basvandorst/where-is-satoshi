I would definitely agree. There is just so much going on with Bitcoin right now and the vast majority of it is good, there is a slow tidal wave of momentum building.  I agree it is silly to call such specific numbers and time frames like "it'll be 700 by January", but I certainly see things slowly ticking upward with fair consistency for the foreseeable future.

Wikileaks much more worthwhile to donate to, imo.

Betcoin is the bees knees, especially if you like poker.  They are literally having a $1,000,000 Guaranteed tournament Sunday night at 5 PM.  They also have a sportsbook, full casino, and dice.  100% deposit bonus, up to 50% rakeback for poker, up to 33% lossback on casino.  If anyone wants to sign up under my referral link I will also pay them 50% of my commission bonus for the first 6 months, just message me your username if you do. ;D

I have a policy to not donate to politicians, but if I did this is the guy I would send my BTC donations to.
Gary Johnson 2016. :D

Aren't the fees really high though?  Like they put the bitcoin price really low, lower than any exchange, so you are probably losing a lot of money...

Welp....forget that, then. :/
