Thanks, this explains a lot.

Noble cause but putting this in r/bitcoin is a stretch.

Is this correct?  He ran a ponzi scheme for BTC in order to fund his day trading.  He collected $4.5M USD worth of bitcoins from investors.  He lost what he skimmed off the top by day trading.  Had he done nothing but held onto his investors bitcoins then he would have turned $4.5M into $60M?

I tried using zigzag &amp; CVS didn't know how to get it to work. The money gram people I spoke to using the red phone hardly spoke English...such a frustrating process.

Bitcoin liquidity problems need to be solved &amp; a major Fortune 500 needs to accept coins. Then it's on.

Apparently his great grandfathers cousin is a Freemason, which we know to be connected to the Illuminati.  The Illuminati want to create a new world order.  Could be this coinbase is a ploy to create a new currency controlled by the new world order.  Thanks for the Goldman Sachs insight and keep up the good detective work. It all makes sense now!

Someone has an order to buy 36,000 bitcoins at $30/bitcoin. It's referred to a bid wall because anyone bidding under $30 is unlikely to have their bids honored.

I predict that in the future, the price for bitcoins will go up or down.  I also believe this is true for all investing.
The price has gone from 48 to 73 to 65 in the past few days.  Those are pretty silly swings.  Personally...I'm not selling because buying coins is such a royal pain in the ass....may as well hold onto them and watch the roller coaster.  Over time, months, years, they'll increase in value.

What a roller coaster.  But not to be surprised...it had to happen.
