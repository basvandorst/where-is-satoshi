Mercy for animals have been incredibly effective in their cause. I'm not associated with them aside from being a fan and giving occasional donations myself (particularly when I see them in the media, it shows how effective they're being). These people have sacrificed so much that it's difficult not to have the utmost respect for them. They're not financially driven, they really are about compassion. And I just checked and they do accept direct bitcoin donations on their donation page [here](

@_date: 2014-03-11 11:29:48


Ok, that's cool. I just wonder if value is not "x" then what the code would do. Just not do the transaction, so that it would have to be done again? seems to be forwarding the concurrency issues. This sort of breaks into philosophy... I don't know the best way to exist, so fuck it.

What is this "thing" you were going to publish? I doubt it even exists, and so will the rest of the community (naturally).

You're single proposal of better way to do it (apart from not using threads at all, which would be impossible) involves this:


But with the addendum of "only if the old balance is still 1000", it does not get past the concurrency problem. Because in between reading the value and updating it, another thread may change the value. So you are exactly back to square one - that is a concurrency issue on reading and updating the value.
tl;dr Your suggested solution brings back the exact same original problem.
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:25:21
that's a good point. we have the amounts and times right? so cant you just search for those amounts and times in the blockchain and infer the addresses?

Let me get this straight. Your **own public promise** is "no obligation to write" ?
@_date: 2015-01-20 11:23:40
I've always wanted a system like this set up, but where you can buy shares in the company.
They can just reward the amount you invested by sending coins back to the addresses where the incoming coins came from. It can be anonymous.
So all you have to do as a company to "go public" is put down your bitcoin address. All you have to do to invest is send some bitcoins to that address.
Of course, the company could also choose not to reward its investors, but that would be a bad company. So the amount you invest would be tied to the companies reputation.

I think you're right about no-one owning the name bitcoin.
In regards to the blocksize, segwit blocks can actually be up to about 3.4MB which is plenty big enough. I am technical and have read the source code. I think unless you can do that, you shouldn't think you know the answer with much certainty.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:43:23
You want it two days after segwit gets activated?
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:03:44
Right. But new app releases are needed in order to support it.
Expecting that to happen two days after activation is, to be frank, ignorant of software development processes.

It's not about the blocksize and it was never about the block size. They're trying to shift control from Core to the corporations. The block size is a red herring.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:38:30
There's only two groups who support SW2X:
1) The people attempting a takeover of Bitcoin for personal profit  
2) Those that are getting played by them
If it were about transaction throughput why not lower the block time from 10 minutes to 2 minutes like litecoin? That'd result in faster transactions and more data throughput.
It's not about block size. If you truly believe it is, which I hope is the case, then you just got played. If you're not a programmer who has read the actual source code it's possible to get fooled.

It's slowly improving over time. Until about a year ago or so most of the code was all still in the main.cpp file and someone actually managed to push through a change to factor some of the code out and do some file renaming. Over time it'll continue to improve little by little. It doesn't really matter how messy it is though, it's had so much testing and peer review and so many people are studying the code so closely that everything is well understood irrespectively.

I've read the source code, and it was clearly hacked together (in a very rough way) by one person. Like any of my projects that I wrote entirely by myself in a big run, it's a complete mess.  
It's natural to get the first iteration out like that then refactor it in the next version. Satoshi never got to the next version. In fact, Core is still working with a lot of that same codebase, which makes it a lot more complicated to work with. Again, it's natural for projects to accumulate technical debt over time, especially when they're being worked on by a group.

No. They are building a marketplace on top of bitcoin and using their force to change the definition of what bitcoin is.

Reading the newspapers each day while the banking royal commission has been sitting is nothing short of breathtaking. One by one, senior executives of the big banks and AMP have been put on the witness stand, under oath, and have been questioned with such intensity that we must now ask the question: where will this all end? 
How systemic to the financial services industry are these breaches? Are these issues really the normal business practice and culture in our financial institutions? One hopes not. Banking has touches on every member of society – it is the oil that flows through the engine room of our nation, a central ingredient in generating wealth, prosperity, productivity and social cohesion.
Many financial commentators, myself included, argued the case that a royal commission into the banking industry wasn't necessary. Some of the big arguments included whether such an expensive exercise (estimated at $53 million) and such a special mechanism was justified. Cases already known were working their way through the regulatory and legal channels. And banks had already spent many years participating in reviews and inquiries related to the financial industry as a whole. 
Before the end of last year, the government had already tried to close the political debate by specifically undertaking sweeping banking reforms (including the BEAR regime, the banking tax, the scheduled and regular banking CEO questioning by Parliament's Economics Committee and so on). In other words, up until late 2017, a royal commission into the banks was seen as overkill. 
Come 2018, we have 20/20 hindsight. Serious evidence has come to light. The sector has been exposed with a litany of issues – compliance breaches, poor financial advice, incentive misalignments, alleged market manipulation of the bank bill swap rate, misleading and deceptive conduct, fraud, cultural problems and unethical practices. It is hard nowadays not to find someone in the street who would be vehemently opposed to a royal commission into the banking industry. 
The floodlights provided by the banking royal commission have rattled the nation. Misconduct appears to be widespread – not just confined to one institution – coupled with the perception that the corporate cop, ASIC, appears to have only been able to use existing laws that are not strong enough. Understandably, there is a very strong likelihood that the commission will need to be extended beyond the original time of September 2018.
Important lessons
While it is still very early days in the banking royal commission, there are already lessons to be learnt and reforms to be contemplated.
First, there appears to be very serious problems of misalignment between the customer and the bank, given the vertical integration of the banking system.
Second, the existing powers of ASIC appear to have been less than effective in preventing patterns of illegal behaviour, and worse still, to remedy breaches in law. Perhaps the powers our financial regulators exhibit are not tough enough to effect the changes that are needed? Strong and effective laws, with real teeth, are needed to rebuild trust and confidence in the financial system.
Third, the inquiries and reviews into the financial sector (such as the Financial System Inquiry) appear to have come in the wrong order. The royal commission should have been the first means to de-politicise the issues that have dragged on for years regarding banking and financial advice scandals.
Fourth, trust in our institutions, including financial firms, must now be at all-time lows. Recent royal commissions into the trade unions and child sexual abuse are also recent cases in point. This is incredibly sad.
Fifth, the financial advice industry has long had issues of educational standards and professional proficiency. The revenue model of firms operating in the financial planning industry needs to be better aligned to client outcomes. Improved disclosure, professionalism and 21st century principal-agent relationships are needed fast.
Sixth, there is a very real risk that negative sentiment might spill out into the broader financial system. This is something that is yet to play out, and won't be fully known until the Hayne royal commission reports to government.
Seventh, overall Australia has genuine world-class financial regulators. We should draw comfort from this. But what we don't need is interference that is politically motivated, where our financial regulators are compelled to meddle in the minutiae of financial entrepreneurship.
The banking royal commission still has a long way to run. It has already proven itself to be the most effective vehicle to bring about genuine reform. I have no doubt that these special powers entrusted to the royal commissioner, Kenneth Hayne, will be the much-needed catalyst for significant and genuine reform in financial services industry. 
My only fear, though, is in the politics in effecting such reforms. Let's hope our politicians don't ruin this important chance.

Just to clear something up for me if anyone can help: When people say that 4 billion was added to the market cap, that does not mean that 4 billion dollars was actually turned into bitcoin does it?
Don't they just take the current price of bitcoin and then declare that market cap = (current price of 1 bitcoin) * (number of bitcoins that exist)? 
So we have no idea how much money has been invested in bitcoin recently or over the years?

Their code is very old because they were one of the very first banks to offer investment through their website, rather then through a person.
It's all so old and crappy now because they were forward-thinking before (and, it appears, still are now).
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:30:34
I think they're seizing control of bitcoin, and once they have control over it they'll take out the bits that they don't like.
They perceive a threat that bitcoin will advance to the stage that it makes their businesses obsolete, so this is a preemptive strike against it to take control of it.
Once they have switched people over to the btc1 repository they don't just plan to sit back and let the protocol advance to the stage where they're obsolete. By that point they'd be in a position where they could do something about it to remain relevant.
I think this explains why most of the exchanges are backing segwit2x. It's not about big blocks. It's about replacing the core devs with people who they have influence over.
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:16:52
That's awesome if you can do that. Paying each other in streams in some scenarios would be really useful.

How do you live now you're loaded?
@_date: 2017-07-05 02:13:46
It's the lightning network that threatens their business models, which can be built on top of segwit.
This is an attempt to overthrow the current core devs before they can implement the lightning network.
If they can replace the core devs with the big blockers vision who are in the corporation's pockets, then their businesses will not be threatened. They only have to prevent the lightning network being developed down the road, not segwit.

That makes sense. What if the server that's responsible for processing a transaction you send is a BCC supporter?
@_date: 2017-07-05 02:05:06
That's true. It'd make a serious dent in their businesses though.
[Erik Voorhees]( is a classic example. He has been an advocate of economic freedom and a libertarian / cypher punk for a long time. But now he inexplicably supports Segwit2x. 
It seems clear that the reason why is because Segwit + lightning would make his company [ShapeShift]( obsolete. He's trying to get ride of the core devs that threaten his business model before they develop the technology which makes it redundant.
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:59:49
If they manage to seize control of bitcoin they'd be able to make it segwit incompatible in the future, even if the blockchain had segwit blocks in it. For example, they could just only allow segwit blocks up until a certain date in the past.
@_date: 2017-07-05 02:45:10
The core devs won't be able to implement the lightning work if they get removed by the current attempt to replace them with more corporate-friendly developers

This technology is incredible. You can actually wire someone some money, and they'll send you some bitcoins, and they made a real website about it.
@_date: 2017-07-05 02:58:47
Right, but if they can overthrow the core devs the point still stands that they will be free to make the lightning network impossible to implement. Once they have control of the source code it will be easy for them.

He basically runs a propaganda spiel on how it's bad that core are a "blessed" group and they're the only ones that can commit changes, and they don't know what they're talking about because he has lots of experience in redhat so he does know what he's talking about.
At some point he also craps on about how softforks force changes onto users that they didn't opt-in to, and he tried to make it sound like it was evil. (BTW, I think that kind of implies (especially the way he said it) that all changes should only be implemented in hardforks, which is obviously ludicrous.
At some point someone points out that litecoin implemented segwit and it worked. He sort of tried to brush that off.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:21:14
That's true, but they can probably overclock them more due to decreased power consumption.
Also, even if they couldn't overclock them more, they'd probably still drop in hash rate anyway due to them maxing out their current power supply lines/DC convertors, etc.

What I don't understand is why someone doesn't make a site where you can buy bitcoins with credit card, or whatever medium the client chooses.
In order to get around the issue whereby the client may do a chargeback later and get free bitcoins, this website would just have to hold the bitcoins without allowing the client to withdraw them for a certain amount of time (like 3 months, or however long the client can do chargebacks for). However, the client would still own the bitcoins, and would have bought them at the current market rate. They would just be in his account and stay in his account until the risk is bypassed.

@_date: 2013-02-28 22:21:04
I think that 97% (guesstimate) of the market is still currently speculation and can go anywhere.
When it becomes significantly more used for goods and services transactions, and when it has a far greater user base, the price will stabilize more and more.
The current bubble is proof of it not yet having stability (which is fun for speculation).
@_date: 2013-03-01 20:59:47
Who wants to wait 3 months for their bitcoin? Well, since over 90% of the market is speculation, then it would be 90% of people who are going long on bitcoin as an investment. Given a user base between 500,000 to 2 million people, it'd be between millions and tens of millions of people, or over 60% of the user base.
@_date: 2013-05-18 06:46:10
Well, I don't think we need to process an ice cream that was bought for 10 cents for the next 10 years. I think 1 year would be enough. Or maybe 1 month. Or maybe 100 verifications.

1. limit the purchase sizes to something manageable. This would again solely be based on the expiration of the possible chargeback rates, so the limit would be rolling over the same period. With a low actual chargeback rate the risk would be minimized.
2. invest long in bitcoin as a part of the business (which you're doing anyway by basing your business on bitcoin)
