Nonsense, it is actually the libabization of the gilded rectarium (only when taken from the third power, of course).

Meh. We're done with Bitpay. Better alternatives out there.

It dropped hard, thus the sale to buy. Still a good price now but you missed the real sale already.

I think the reality is that its been in Coinbase's (interest bearing to them) bank account since a couple of hours after you okay'd the deposit. Coinbase just hasn't given you access to your funds after two weeks because they are busy and don't want to waste their profits on silly things like customer support.

Too late if you didn't get it. Flash sale it was. Already climbing back. Made money before I even got the buy confirmation. Merry Christmas.
On a related note: GDAX is down - reporting a "minor outage". The site is dead, I wonder what they consider a major outage?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:37:39
Absolutely not.

Thanks for the suggestion Payza rep , but I'm sticking with Circle and Coinbase. So far, they've given me no reason to think that they'll "misplace" their customers' funds.

In December 2013 my and every USA resident's funds in our Payza accounts were frozen. We were told by Payza that this was the result of the action of USA Homeland Security who had seized Payza funds. We were assured that Payza was working it out. 
As of today, nearly one year later, not only have we not been given an update on this by Payza in six months, but while our Payza accounts used to show our balance, they now show $0.00. There are a tremendous amount of people in the USA waiting for Payza to release our funds to us and now it appears that they have simply written off/erased the funds we had in our Payza accounts? Pardon me if I don't trust you with my Bitcoin.

Chimed in here yesterday :

Here is their last (early last summer) update to us on this. Basically telling us that it isn't their problem because unbeknownst to us, Payza subcontracted out the handling of our (USA residents) funds to some other service and "the other service took our money" - 
This is pretty much like taking your car into the dealership to get repaired, they say they will fix it so you pay the dealership for the repairs. Then you come back to the dealership to pick up the car and find it was never fixed, but the dealership tells you that it isn't their problem or responsibility because while you understood that the dealership mechanic was fixing your car, they instead sent it to some shady guy's garage someplace and he didn't fix it.

Yes, you could do that of course but seems a rather drastic measure to alter your life permanently to avoid a 15% tax on what is basically a "lottery" winning. In my opinion, anyway. Maybe if I had over 4 million to cash out I'd think differently!
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:02:54
Not a good move financially, if you a US citizen you pay US taxes regardless of where in the world you live. "Bonus bummer" - if you are a US citizen living in another country and have an income source there you not only pay US income tax but you are also liable for that country's taxes.

I might work on it. In the mean time, here is an earlier thing I did about Jaime - 
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:06:26
I sent a little from my TREZOR to coinbase this afternoon around 4:30. Full fee listed as “priority”. Took about 4 1/2 hours to get six confirmations. I think there are just a ton of transactions happening today.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:44:33
Just to rub it in a bit, why not message the ex back and tell her this:  "I am sorry that I haven't had a chance to reply because in addition to my career and family, I've now made millions in Bitcoin and have been so busy working with financial advisors figuring out how to handle so much wealth. "
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:13:01
That's the gimmick. They know that most people will be willing to pay the "convenience fee" to avoid the artificial wait time for fund deposit. ACH withdrawals are pretty much instant.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:48:04
Good luck. Hope it gets straightened out quickly. That’s allot of money for those jackasses to freeze without giving you a proper explanation. They are as bad as PayPal. Fuck them.

If you don't want those fiat shitcoins, I'd be happy to take them off your hands. I promise I'll find a good use for them.

The third party seller could be fine. Still, With the value of Bitcoin and alts is it worth trading your confidence in the wallet security for a measly $30?
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:06:44
Interesting. People in their 40's don't have disposable income? If your net worth is less when you're 40 than at 30, you've got a problem.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:27:26
If your reply was for meant for me, know that my reply was joking...sarcasm. The guy I replied to was relaying an interesting story and clearly had moved on and wasn't going to interact further with his ex. I certainly didn't have any reason to think that he would actually take my advice and "rub it in". He laughed along and that was the end of it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:45:10
It is going to just get crazier. Hitting milestones every couple of days now. I don’t think it would be a stretch to predict $20k by the end of this year.

OP was right. It actually began to rise just after his post. Unfortunately I see by the price chart that you must be fighting constipation again.

I'll definitely never understand why it takes Coinbase 7-8 days to complete an ACH transfer from a US bank account. Small grocery stores can do it much faster. Even in the earliest days of ACH it only took around 5. Since I see that Coinbase debits my bank account the same or next day, the cynical part of me can't help but think that they hold the money for a week to get a week's interest off it. A hidden fee.

@_date: 2017-10-19 21:15:35
You and I are on the same page. I'm not complaining about Bitcoin needing time to work through these issues. I'm defensive regarding the idea that Bitcoin shouldn't aim to be used for all (including smaller) transactions.
Just to clarify, my disagreement was with the statement that Bitcoin wasn't intended to be used as a day-to-day currency. That was actually precisely what was being talked about early on - a replacement for fiat. Kudos for using it for every day transactions, I'm right there with you.
Unfortunately, if you are using Bitcoin for business purposes, a few hours actually is too long. I'm not giving you my coffee (or access to my website, downloads, etc.) until I'm certain the money is in my wallet and the customer isn't going to wait a few hours to get what they paid you for. Of course we have third-party payment processors that help with this (and we are using them) to make it work, but, yes, I'm anxiously awaiting tools like LN so that, eventually, it can realistically be peer-to-peer.
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:29:36
Some fancy-dancy, new fangled thing the kids are all talking about. It's just another fad that will blow over soon.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:50:44
More fees. How long until they tack on things like a  "chain maintenance fee", "accounting fee", "utilities fee", " digital convenience fee" , and God knows what else? Seem far-fetched? Check your bank statement now to see the fees they pull out of their arse to make more off of you.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:28:52
Noticed the "High Risk". So even with Bitcoin you'll be charging higher fees to adult businesses? If so, pretty much completely defeats the purpose, in fact it is preposterous since a payment processor isn't even needed to accept Bitcoin payments.

Up and up she goes. Where she’ll stop nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:03:55
I don't mean that bowers don't know the interest rate, I'm saying banks earn more on your deposits than you do. No fault at all, its what they do to stay in business. Still, in the OP's scenario, beside the items you mentioned in your response, it seems perfectly reasonable to assume we'll see more fees at some point. Banks want in for that possibility to take "their cut". No reason for them to get involved just to make miners more money without taking a little for themselves.

Thank you, I forgot "hidden fees". Does your bank lend money for a higher interest rate than they pay you for your deposits? Get your point that some banks are better than others. Still, in answer to the OP's question, historical evidence of what banks do is charge fees.

Bitpay is a joke. They might as well have named themselves PayPal Jr.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:19:25
Really? When was that decided? I swear when I first got excited about Bitcoin years ago it was because on this very sub one of the promises being made was how it could be used as a "Paypal killer". There are a shit tonne of us in the adult industry that can't use vanilla payment providers who have been huge supporters of Bitcoin for the very reason that it was being promoted earlier on by the Bitcoin community as exactly what we needed for peer to peer daily transactions in our businesses/communities.
