Bitcoin will never be adopted mainstream until there are safety mechanisms in place to protect peoples funds and/or transactions. Until this, Bitcoin will forever be what it is today.
@_date: 2014-08-21 21:52:37
Exactly why I believe that Bitcoin will never be used mainstream with the way debit/credit cards are.
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:15:45
I would think it's more for the IRS and FBI. IRS wants to be sure they get all their tax money. FBI wants to be sure you're not doing something they don't like.

Excellent explanation. That sweet spot is in there somewhere.

Just remember Senator...this is business, and business is good. Show the world that America is all about business by making necessary changes.

I think what I'm seeing right now, is that as people across the states are waking up, they're going to be mainly selling. I'm looking for hopefully a drop to about 450 to jump back in.

I've got to agree with Motafication. 
Don't think for a minute that these guys will just take this laying down. All they have to do, is strong arm the right groups (FBI, IRS, SEC, etc. etc.) and this whole thing will come either to a halt, or be extremely regulated.
Look at when the internet itself came out. Incredible. Completely changed the world. However, they started to regulate it. Now we've got the DMCA, Patriot Act, Bandwidth Caps (even if 'Unlimited' /s), Taxes now appearing on across state sales and I'm sure there's a few more laws passed to regulate or control it.
If they don't like it or something about it, it will be regulated. So even more than everyone being on the 'bitcoin is great bandwagon', we should be calling our government representatives every single day. Telling them we want to see support that's positive for bitcoins and to keep it a truly free currency.

yeah I reckon after the west coast does their morning sell off

If you have enough money that your not paying tax on, you best pick a country with no extradition treaty with the USA, otherwise, things will be painful.

Fuck the banks.

Don't know anything else...should I be using something different?
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:30:50
But are their services more reliable for fast trades? I've heard a lot of upset people about mt gox because of engine delays
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:34:01
Probably depends on the IRS agent your dealing with and how they determine it. No matter what, you want to get a good CPA to assist with any large gains over $10k
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:06:47
I can't get their system to do their verification charges to my cc, and so Instabuy isn't on....shit system.

Somehow I see this alone as a huge reason why wide spread adoption may never happen.
If I put my money into a bank, and there was no FDIC on it, I can't 100% trust it. That's exactly what they'll think, and what they'll say.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:32:30
Doublespeak is what their area of expertise.
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:36:29
Exactly. And If anyone even thinks that the Chinese Gov't are going to somehow just switch to Bitcoin they're dreaming. Governments want their own controlled fiat currency every day of the week.
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:06:54
Ah, gotcha. Bitstamp is a pretty slick interface. I'll go with that one. I appreciate the suggestions and information. I can only imagine what will happen if Mt. Gox goes bankrupt.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:06:13
What's twisted about this dipshits logic, is that it's like saying, well, we feel you COULD abuse it, so therefore we can't allow it. What's that sound similar to? I think the failure of a 'War on Drugs'
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:45:55
But the situation for bitcoin is worse. If there's a breach at an exchange and my money is stolen from my account, I'm SOL. 
If there's a bank robbery at my local bank, and its FDIC insured, I still have my money.
Faith is everything in currency acceptance.
Just look at Iraq. They had a new currency made because the old one was Saddams. But people there, now 11 years later, are still using USD. Why? Because they don't trust their currency fully yet. Lack of Faith in the government.
I think while it's easy to sit around and sing Kumbaya together and talk about the greatness that is bitcoin, it has some very serious problems before true widespread adoption will really happen.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:23:15
I wouldn't put it past them to try and enforce it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:30:56
I think it will. Just too much volatility in it right now.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:19:08
For me the kicker was the ever increasing difficulty. Between now and then (~ 4 Months) the difficulty with increase so much, that the ASIC miner is like half the power of what it needs to be or more. It pretty much came down to the hope that if you did get it, that you'd hit a sweet spot where the number of miners drops off, difficulty doesn't increase as fast, and that you end up getting more BTC because of it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:50:22
I totally agree. 
In explaining to others about bitcoins, you tell them pay in a bitcoin they're almost $600 or w/e. They always ask, well what if the item is $200? I have to tell them, pay in price / market value of BTC. Then they always ask what about the rest....
1, 5, 10, 20, 100. There's a reason currency is denoted in those. I think people look at it like hard physical currency still and that they'll show up with a single coin worth a certain amount and no idea how to use it in a fractional value still.
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:39:46
I've done the math over and over. There is literally no point in mining by yourself right now. It seems that unless you have the top of the line ASIC setup, you aren't going to make money.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:38:15
This this this. I can't tell you how badly the IRS can fuck you. They can take a tax that's say $10,000 and turn it into something that's $100,000, and there's nothing you can usually do about it, if the original $10,000 is in fact owed. You don't find out about it right away either. It's usually 2-3 years down the road when you've either blown thru all your money, or have to start being a bit cautious with it, and then the penalties, interest and fees are for that entire period of time.
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:06:43
No kidding! I have a long list of things to do, and paying $1k for a party isn't one of them.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:00:50
Take a chill pill douche.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:12:14
Hmm...well at the current rate, the difficulty changes don't look to be going in anyone's favor. I guess I still don't see why anyone would be mining at all right now given the difficulty, and how its expected to increase.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:23:23
I'm not panicking...I'm just waiting for another buy opportunity...

The coinbase restriction screwed me out of buying more coins this morning....moving on to the exchanges for doing btc now.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:54:49
So hover between maybe 580 and 650ish? I could see that happen. I'm moving my funds to btc-e to hopefully not go thru the crap of coinbase anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:34:07
A few nice ad hominems there ;)
If you think for even a minute that their grasp begins and ends in the US, Europe, etc. you have another thing coming to you. Where do you think these guys don't operate?
The vast majority of people do not want their lives ruined over migrating to bitcoin. No matter what you think people should do, doesn't mean they will do it. They have a basically unlimited bank account to spin the bitcoin realm as dangerous, bad, etc. to get the majority of people to reject going to it.

These ASIC machines are not meant to do anything other than mine from what I can tell.

Yup. And here comes MST on board now.

Are you seriously advocating people just leave to a new country over taxes? c'mon man. Russia has its issues too. Just because the US Govt wastes money, doesn't mean all of it is for bad things.
Not exactly sure how student debt plays into this conversation, but lets not forget that we all have the choice to go to school, and which one. I know people who picked schools that cost 30k / year  and have easily over 100k in debt, I know other people who picked schools that cost 7k / year and have little to no debt.
Life is about more than just money.

I really don't want to deal with a collapse in my lifetime. 
I really don't. 
The last recession sucked ass big time. I'm not selfish enough either to be happy that I have bitcoins and the vast majority don't. I would rather not see others suffer in such an environment. Things would turn ugly very quickly for everyone, bitcoin or not.
