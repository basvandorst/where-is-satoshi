The majority of people won't have a problem with Coinbase. The part that is most concerning to me is how they are ignoring a sizable fraction of consumer complaints. Not even a courtesy email acknowledging their existence.

*Everyone* has gained 5 million new users in a month, if not more. The amount of complaints against Coinbase in this regard, in comparison to other exchanges, is extraordinary. They have problems with their infrastructure and customer service that makes them quite literally and technically NOT "A service that works best for me."
"...First they came for the whales, but I was not a whale, so I did not stand up for them..."

Now, a rational answer in defense of Coinbase is with the spike in popularity and awareness over the last three months on cryptocurrency, that Coinbase just did not have the infrastructure in place to handle the surge. That line of reasoning would be understandable, however Bloomberg reported last August on the growing problem with the company responsibly handling its userbase’s money.
I understand that cryptocurrency has been growing more than steadily over the past year and a half, but Coinbase is the largest and most popular exchange out there right now. They should have had the vision and wherewithal to plan for this uptick in user volume before it even began. Every other exchange has also gone through similar growing pains, but their customer support platform has been able to faithfully handle its transasction issues, nowhere near on the level of problems Coinbase is experiencing.
There are quite a few alternatives that you should be using instead of Coinbase/GDAX. I personally use Gemini, but I have found many people also like Kraken. Until further notice, unless Coinbase gets their house in order, new investors and traders should be guided away from Coinbase as much as possible.

I cover a lot of ground in this article, so here is an out of context excerpt:
Herein lies the beauty of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. The power to change the foundation of that building becomes incredibly simple. The bureaucracy that is baked into every facet of our society becomes absolutely meaningless in the face of blockchain solutions. While the conservative mindset that drives the opinion to keep the code as antique as possible is still a powerful driving voice in the Bitcoin community, eventually it will give way to the best of the new technology that has proven usecases. Every single fork that has or will exist in the future are but flashlights peering into the shrouded mystery that is Bitcoin’s future.

This is actually pretty uplifting news in my opinion, courtesy our friends over at TMZ. Critically Acclaimed Rapper, actor and gun attack survivor Curtis James Jackson III, perhaps known better by his stage name “50 Cent”, can now add bitcoin investor to his impressive portfolio of titles. 
Back in 2014, 50 Cent accepted Bitcoin as payment for his album Animal Ambition, which TMZ is told garnered him around 700 BTC worth of sales. That is currently worth $7,670,000.
Maybe he should take a page out of Snoop Lion’s book and change his name to 0.00004515 BTC?

Personally, I use Gemini. Others I know use Kraken.

Obvious bullshit? No, it is factually accurate. 
Coinbase received 288 CFPB complaints alone in 2017. *Every other company combined* only received 277. But hey, thanks for assuming I was important enough to have some kind of political bent. Don't debate based off your emotions on the subject, bring facts to the table.

Low effort, thanks for reading the entirety of my article in between the two minutes that I posted the link and your reply. Tom Lee predicted a floor at 9000 two weeks ago, i went lower, learn what speculation means regarding currencies and I hope you won't lose too much money. PBOC news has scared the entire market.

It’s finally Friday, which means we are freed from our shackles once more for the weekend! For most people, this week has been extremely hectic and the upcoming break to be with our families and friends will be much needed. For those of us here in the United States, spending Valentine’s Day with your loved ones, and then the same day also learning of the horrific tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida has proven to be an extreme stress test on the psyche of our culture.
Thankfully, those of us in the world of cryptocurrency can look to our wallets and the exchanges this weekend to sweeten the mood. The Pumpening certrainly seems to be on in some areas, though I caution the bear market might stick around for a week or two longer. Here are a few coins that we can watch for action over the next few days.

I wouldn't believe precious metals would help too much when you are trying to span the distance between galaxies! Probably time to introduce the aliens to lightning network by then.

The People’s Bank of China sees all cryptocurrencies as illegal, as they are not directly issued from any major respected treasury or country. Because of this, they believe no single token holds any legal status that would equate it to ‘money’ in the traditional sense, and advises people of the dangers of pyramid-level marketing schemes designed to funnel money into an insider-few.

Imagine being an extra-terrestrial, knowing that humanity exists on a planet called Earth on the farthest reaches of the milky way galaxy. You try your hardest to contact them, but they are busy using their immense technological power to mine Ethereum. I mean at that point, its alien invasion time, right?

I now believe that Bitcoin can and will reach the depths of the low $6000 range before the upward trend takes off once again. Looking at the 1 Week moving average convergence divergence (MACD) on Binance, it looks as if the fun is just beginning for us. Currently the MACD shows we have not yet passed over into the buy threshold. After the Head and shoulders pattern we saw several hours ago, bearish symmetries occurred that sent BTC into a descending channel. The only good news here is that we will see a slight uptrend at the end of the channel, but that will come well ahead of the drop that sends coin valuation down into $6000 range of possibilities. Keep an eye on Bitcoin throughout the night and into Tuesday, as there will be a buying opportunity relatively soon.
Everyone who understands the long term implications of blockchain technology isn’t sweating the correction. Even if you bought in at the all time high’s set in November and December, those prices will pale in comparison to what the markets will represent one year from now. And in five years from now, this will only be seen as a blip on the radar, one of the tremendous buyback opportunities that presented itself before coin values skyrocketed once again. There is no telling how many of these opportunities we are going to have left as we move forward, so it is important to not get discouraged right now and to continue to educate yourselves on how to make as much money as you can on the road to $100,000 valuation.

Bitcoin mining operations in Iceland are designed and built specifically to take full advantage of the country's cold winds and volcanic energy. This seems like a cryptocurrency miner's paradise, but what cost is the industry having on native Icelanders' share of the power grid?
