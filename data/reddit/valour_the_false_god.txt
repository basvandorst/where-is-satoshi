"finance through a dealer" isn't that no different than from a bank? It's still a loan. In the US it's usually cheaper to go with a ~bank~ credit union than a dealership financing though
Edit: wording

Part of me understands why they do that, being that people would abuse the system the second they get a chance,but another part of me feels like if your a kid or even Sol, they should offer a one time fuck up option.

I was wondering what a satoshi unit was :)

Maybe you're thinking of market cap as like a top/end cap?
It's just shortened for market capital.

I don't think so. Depends on what you want to do. If you want "now" money you could try day trading. But it's no different from gambling at a casino (better gains though that's forsure) or you could do a long term investment which is hella wiser. I've made a good spot of money off of say trading. Like pay for Netflix good LOL. but hey, worth it to me.

I've been testing trading out personally with my left over eth I had from buying alt coins for hodl. I had roughly 7.00 usd in eth to poke at, and after 5 days of trading regularly, reading charts, following news, I've doubled it :p I learned a lot of hard lessons, and I'm glad I did with 7.00 and not 100.00 or 500.00 or even 1k. The hardest lesson for me were both, realizing you'll just about never buy at exact peak and exact depth. Sometimes though, but most of the time naw lol. And with that, not to be too greedy. But def learn to read charts.

Best recommended reading material for super nubs? 
I've know of Bitcoin since it's creation, but it was only recently that I've had spare munnies to invest anywhere. 
Also I had this guy come in (I work in a bakery) who requested I write "first million!" On his cake with a Bitcoin symbol. So yeh, was a little inspired. :)

What's a fork?
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:13:33
I agree, I don't expect Bitcoin to be *the* one to turn into a true currency, but I do believe it'll be the one to rein in the one that could/will be a true currency. The only chance I think it'll have is maybe acting as a thousand dollar bill would (if not a 10k note) and other currencies acting as 100's, 50's, 20's ect. But I really doubt it.

You could sell back to the grid if the company actually pays decently for it and didn't fist the price they offer. I'm not so salty. *Sips Marg*
