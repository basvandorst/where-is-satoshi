They better trade that for USD before it turns into $500k

Exactly - I actually wait too for the 2FA temporary code countdown to go to 3 seconds before typing it in.
If someone is livestream intercepting my key strokes and I type the code in at 22 seconds, that gives the attacker 21 seconds or so to login using my 2FA temporary code (assuming they have the password too).
By waiting until 3 seconds before typing it in, I submit at 1 second and that gives them very little time to use it.

Was that before or after [the Heartbleed Bug]( was revealed?
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:01:38
We'll have to wait and see what does, so far he/she hasn't collected the first $1 lol, let alone play it forward.  But so far you seem to have a 50/50 chance. is the only other player in this thread as of this post, so maybe you can play :-)
But, this game may have ended as quickly as it started, we'll see...
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:19:13
It'll be called "appleseed".
You didn't hear that from me.
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:40:45
Game on.  Here's 1 dollar. verify

How can they go under if they are going to the moon?
@_date: 2014-06-06 03:15:54
It would have to be somebody in the thread, don't you think?
The other thing that could cause it to fizzle beyond keeping it is people simply not following through. 
Maybe a rule that if you don't accept the tip within an hour, the tipper may cancel the tip and chose somebody new.
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:00:38
Well, I started it with changetip, but so far no response yet.  We'll see what happens...
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:34:43
I'm here :-)
So, I'm going to rethink this idea over the weekend, and see if we can make it fun.
spttedmarley brings up a good point, this being the internet, $1 USD / 0.0015 BTC in some parts of the world is several meals.  Some people work all day for that, so if they receive $4, it's party time.  They sure as hell won't give it away to someone, *let alone add* $1 USD to it and pass it on.
That was naive of me to suggest, I guess.
Anyways, again, thanks for making me feel at least a couple other redditors get the *spirit* of the concept, so that was worth the dollar and getting signed up for changetip!
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:43:05
Thanks for your honesty, but you might end up getting hooked into the game anyways :-)   But, yeah, we'll have to figure out how to extend the game past $25, that is, *if we get to the $25 limit*. 
The twenty-fifth player will have to figure it out, or is that the twenty-sixth player?
Maybe multiple $25 tip comments?  We'll see what creative solutions the gamers come up with. 
It's up to now...
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:45:52
You would seriously keep $1 worth of BTC? 
Shall we test you?
Post your bitcoin wallet address, I will test if you are greed or hero. Please be hero!
@_date: 2014-12-11 21:01:43
But now, sell at Waldorf constant ratio of peak. Profit.
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:30:12
It's in your [changetip account](  I can confirm, it was collected/delivered.
To keep the game experiment going, pick a user comment in this thread to reply to, like perhaps, and [follow these instructions on how to send a tip in reddit](
Since you are adding two numbers together (what you got plus $1) I guess you'll have to send an explicit BTC amount like "0.003 BTC".
BE A HERO!
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:30:01
LOL, how funny.  I thought I had an interesting idea.  Keep the $1 for your troubles, and have a great weekend!
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:01:19
Noob here.  I have some LTC and BTC.  Should I move my LTC to BTC?

You are experiencing FOMO; Fear Of Missing Out.
I got the fever several years ago when BTC was going to the moon. That shit dropped LITERALLY the hour I bought. It never got to that point again, until last week.
So last week it was pushing $1300 and I finally sold them, bought Ethereum instead.

I'm guessing the market went up, and down, and up and down again.
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:49:47
His argument is that bitcoin shouldn't be approved because it's used in the black market.
US Dollars are used in the black market, so... not sure that professor's argument is a strong one.

I remember when that was a value that was only weeks away when it was shooting up. 
I've been sitting on that bitch since then. I bought at the literal worst time. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 06:51:16
This seems to miss the point of Bitcoin. I don't want people getting charged processing fees.

Not to mention, Snoop has friends all over the world, so Bitcoin/Litecoin are a great way for him to send some "love" to them quickly &amp; anonymously.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:21:16
After sleeping on it, hearing you say "bitties" for mBTC sounds so good!  At the very least it's good slang.
Your tattoo idea, we shall call them bitstamps!
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:49:39
Understandable. When you purchased those 10BTC  you only had $200 invested. That was many months ago. So I can see how you could be lazy with the authentication. 
And really, you only lost $200, not $10k, so it's a cheap lesson to learn.
EDIT: $200 invested, not $100
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:45:17
And.... [your wrong already](

No, he doesn't need more coins.  He needs their value to continue to rise.

Nice!  Do you think this us a bubble? Are you gonna keep riding the wave up and set a bailout point if it starts to plummet, or sell once it reaches some point?
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:36:15
We should just call them "bitties", pronounce it like "titties".
"I can't believe I just tipped that stripper 65 bitties for showing me her little titties!"

@_date: 2013-12-01 01:09:27
It's not too late for bitcoins or litecoins. 5 years from now 1 BTC could quite conceivably be with $1,000,000USD. So if you put in just $100 now, that could turn into $100,000. If not, then you lose $100. Big deal, the risk benefit ratio is astronomical.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:35:04
Did you sell or keep them?  It's over a 1000 now.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:16:14
Send me all your monies, I buy for you! 
EDIT: I'm just joking.

When CEO's allow themselves to become the shareholder's and board's little bitch, Apple in 2013 is what happens.
Steve Jobs would have been all over Bitcoin, the fucking renegade he was.  He would have figured out how to make Bitcoin *better*, slap an apple logo on that shit, and make $100 billion off it.  He would have made Bitcoin cool.
Tim Cook?  Just a little bitch.

I got mine about 3 business days after signing up. I was able to purchase @ $890/BTC, but it won't apply until Dec 3. I really want to play with some LTC.
