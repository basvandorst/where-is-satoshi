Exciting times. Can't wait to power-blackout alone after work. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:16:21
There'll certainly be some THC in the mix as well :) 
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:10:31
10/10 made me cringe 
@_date: 2018-05-11 07:33:53
Fuck my ass
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:37:08
But how does that mean it's not sustainable? 
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:47:49
Selling at market value is literally what drives the price down. Thousands of buy orders, wiped off the table. It has nothing to do with FUD.
Go do some basic cryptocurrency research, buddy. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:13:02
Literally hurts my eyes bro
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:24:45
Why's everyone so doubtful? This happens all the time, and it always recovers 
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:24:28
How does this have anything to do with my knowledge of depth on an exchange? 
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:16:08
Completely irrelevant article. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:47:51
From April 12th, nice going OP. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:58:18
Shart-ass? 
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:11:19
I'm not sure you know what renting means. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 17:46:25
Explain what this so-called "Bitcoin Core" is. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:46:34
That's caused by my cocaine intake, dipshit. Again, do some research buddy. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:25:30
Yes quality shitpost 10/10
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:37:48
Well I am from the future, so your argument is invalid. Sorry. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:53:34
You're annoying. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:48:51
Let's go!!! 
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:53:17
The downtown area of my city has many people collecting donations for various things. Although, they advertise using cardboard signs rather than reddit. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:55:33
Whatever it is don't listen to it
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:38:40
Bought at 9.6k
Sold at 8.2k
Hopes it's a dead cat bounce 
@_date: 2018-05-07 10:13:50
You are correct, it hasn't recovered in the last 3 months. However, for the last 10 years bitcoin has crashed numerous times yet continues to hit new ATHs. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:35:17
FUD 
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:23:41
Use square cash! 
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:46:53
Don't take investment advice from people on reddit.
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:49:34
As a currency, Bitcoin is better than it's ever been. Fees and confirmation times are down. Adoption is up. From an investment standpoint, bitcoin may not be doing so well, but if your comments are indeed from an invest standpoint then they belong in r/bitcoinmarkets
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:28:10
Yeah honestly buying with a CC is pretty sketchy... If anything the interest will just rek your gainz
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:12:35
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:29:28
You screenshotted a post and posted it to the same subreddit? Why? 
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:37:21
That's just stupid, are they gonna stop shopping everywhere that accepts cash and card as well? 
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:10:47
Did you read the post? He didn't ask if bitcoin had a government. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:14:17
Minimum ticket size has nothing to do with how much people are buying
@_date: 2018-06-05 12:24:30
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:06:38
If you read the post, you can see that he is trying to install a bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 07:58:16
Withdraws are near instant, been using square for a while now. Much better than coinbase 
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:34:14
...Because it's a spare pc. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 10:59:41
Yes. It will never recover. Accept it.
On the other hand, I see a massive bull run coming up. It'll hit the 250k range. It might go down tho tbh, but if not it'll probably go up. This is just speculation however, I am not an investment advisor. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:06:57
Don't feed the troll guys 
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:11:51
You're thinking of r/Bitcoinmarkets
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:30:32
Drove over to Grand Coulee over the weekend to do some TA, you can check it out [here.](
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:15:29
Well, technically. The spread is probably artificial, but regardless it's only about a 1% difference. Far better than Coinbase's 4% debit card fee. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:09:49
[We really are screwed ](
@_date: 2018-06-30 09:13:55
The fuck is this? Go back twitter
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:53:35
Yes, because CME represents the U.S. as a whole. Nothing pleases us U.S. citizens more than seeing the rich getting richer. And we all have so much BTC that we just can't wait to sell for cheap! 
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:17:56
My gut is telling me to sell, indicating an upcoming trend reversal. Bullish 
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:19:49
PM me the private key to your BTC wallet and my uncle who owns Microsoft will be in contact with you about your funding options
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:55:11
Awe did someone panic sell a little early?
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:06:17
2017 as well 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:31:15
Take that shit somewhere else 
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:54:24
Make sure it's from a sketchy overseas company with little info on the development team. These tend to be the most profitable, as they promise returns of at least 10,000% over a year. Only a true crypto noob would pass that opportunity up. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:40:13
Can't tell if trolling or stupid 
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:00:47
Whore you? So a prostitution platform, cool, btw this doesn't belong here. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 08:58:58
Square cash 
@_date: 2018-07-11 08:55:30
Why does this matter? 
@_date: 2018-07-01 16:07:06
Nobody here is interested, go away 
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:28:32
BGD time 
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:57:13
@_date: 2018-07-12 10:39:33
You should've centered it... 
@_date: 2018-07-11 08:42:48
I recommend using the square cash app
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:23:44
I love purse, those discounts really add up 
@_date: 2018-07-12 10:24:25
We might have the same one, can you post a pic of the back? 
@_date: 2018-04-26 02:20:26
Ƀ is indeed still a currency. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:26:26
I take it you are very smart. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:40:23
6.6k in 2016? What are you on? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:49:58
We'll never know... 
@_date: 2018-04-28 08:34:45
Let the weekend pump begin! 
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:00:22
I need your private key to send more than 1 BTC
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:03:27
True but at the same time, it could go down.
I'm not really sure though, it might go up 
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:03:06
I use square cash. Instant fiat deposit and no purchase fee, other than the spread 
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:49:02
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:22:40
I was hoping to get to a full bitcoin before the next rally. Oh well, to the moon! 
@_date: 2018-07-03 12:49:47
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:33:29
Especially the last decade 
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:11:56
Get ready guys!! 
@_date: 2018-04-28 11:23:04
This is irrelevant to 99% of bitcoin users. Try a DNM sub. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:00:38
Convert to BTC
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:07:59
Costs 0.01btc to download 
@_date: 2018-04-12 07:24:16
Calm down guys he's just using internet explorer 
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:24:31
Are the coffee shops everything they're hyped up to be? Would love to someday buy a joint there with BTC 
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:29:37
Bitcoin knows that guy! 
@_date: 2018-04-28 07:43:11
I already did, where is my payment
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:19:02
Where have you been for the last 2 weeks? 
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:47:47
High on amphetamine, right?
@_date: 2018-12-21 10:54:29
Just because lots of places near YOU accept it, doesn't mean places everywhere do. My city has two stores that accept bitcoin: A jewelry store and a pot shop. Sorry, you can't live off jewelry and pot.
