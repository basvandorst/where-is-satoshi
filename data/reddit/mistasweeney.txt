I don't think that any current media interaction is particularly relevant at this stage. Bitcoin has been boom or bust until this point. It doesn't do things slowly. It's either not moving or shooting up/down. 
If mass adoption is going to happen, intelligent and large companies like Amazon, Google and others will move in very quickly so they can get the goods while their hot. This will cause a massive spike straight into mass adoption.

I personally disagree, and I would use Overstock.com/NewEgg adoption as my reasoning. 
Granted they have stronger incentive because they need to take advantage of every edge they can get on their competition being the underdogs, but they bolstered the Bitcoin community tremendously and I don't think that Amazon has a reason to wait until Bitcoin reaches full mast to jump on board. 
Amazon just needs security, reliability, usability and simplicity to be on par with current methods of transaction.

What's the difference?
Thanks for the info man. Big help.

Ahh that makes sense. Is that just a theory or consensus opinion?
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:03:09
True. These are all steps in the right direction. But Amazon's *endorsement* is the focus of my point.
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:01:16
Yeah the distinction is beneficial for now, but ultimately you'd hope a currency wouldn't have substantial enough losses year-over-year that people need to execute wash sales :P
I'm not 100% sure on this but there may also be a limit to how much you can claim. All the info I have given is spit-back from the various bitcoin forums, in this case mostly The community over there are quite familiar with financial law and regulation, many of the larger community members having come from trading other commodities. 
Good luck!

Seeing as you seem to be saying there *is* a viable way to use key signatures to create a universal and uncompromisable (save for user error) password:
- Are people working on this? 
- Do you think we will see something like this be released? 
- Since this has nothing to do with blockchain technology and all to do with elliptic curve cryptography (is that correct?) why have we not seen this yet?

They can freeze your funds and they are a single point of failure for *your* money.


The whole "you are your own bank" statement is intended to pique interest and isn't a very accurate way of describing how a bitcoin user manages their funds. 
The bank is the blockchain, which will go on with or without you and will protect your coins assuming you don't allow anyone access to your private key. It's more accurate to say that there are no *centralized* banks [with bitcoin], so point of failure is now *just* you, instead of you **and** a bank. This is clearly more secure and there isn't any greater level of work involved. Someone can steal your bank info or your bitcoin info equally. The tradeoff here is removing the need for trust, at the expense of insurance [from a bank].
The blockchain is clearly the more secure bank and you have greater flexibility and more available utilities to *increase* security on your own.


Any 2 party utility must be used to be accepted and must be accepted to be used, its a catch 22. If there is a benefit to use one utility v another all users will eventually migrate to the superior utility. 
The issue with Bitcoin is the difficulty in educating the masses due to its complexity and its introduction of (relatively) new concepts.


This is a loaded question. There usually *is* something in it financially for
those who are spreading the good word of bitcoin. That doesn't negate the equal benefit everyone in the world can receive by jumping on board. Also, the zealotry is par for the course with revolutionary and underappreciated advancements, the extent of which is telling of the individual not the stance he holds.

This just turned on a lightbulb in my head. 
Upwards pressure on the price by increasing the user base just a few million users, effectively doubling the amount of users, would be tremendous. 
BUT "user base" implies a "use". If a simple but effective utility was developed that was usable with Bitcoin *only* (as opposed to it's current utility as an *alternative* (albeit superior) option for many things) Bitcoin would be able to capture a new audience, immersing some of them deep in Bitcoin, blowing up the price, attracting media attention and recognition, spreading adoption and putting this whole locomotive on the fast track to reaching its ultimate potential.

Called a wash sale. Only applies to securities AFAIK. You could probably buy the bitcoin back immediately.

I get it if that's a joke, but why does that genuinely seem to be case? Is there an actual reason why this happens?
@_date: 2014-09-05 20:00:51
Ah that's what you meant, for some reason I thought that companies as big as NewEgg would handle it on their own.
If Amazon jumped in I have a feeling they would try to get their beak wet by jumping into the payment processing game themselves. Just a hunch.
@_date: 2014-09-05 14:33:51
No question Overstock and NewEgg are blazing the path that all other merchants will follow. Adopt or drop. As underdogs they are willing to take the risk and experiment because they need to fight for that competitive edge.
I personally think that the current price stagnation is due to the world holding it's breath for Bitlicense in NY and Overstock. Even though they are just 2 specific instances of merchant adoption and regulation, they have clearly set themselves apart as willing to get into the thick of things and figure out which direction Bitcoin is going. Most of the US is waiting on NY and most of the world is waiting on the US. Similarly Amazon/Ebay are waiting on Overstock. I think the dominoes will fall rapidly when decisions in these organizations are made.

He doesn't have to pay the premium if HE put up the ad and decides the price. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:09:01
I don't understand what you mean by payment processor. Bitcoin *is* the payment processor (but I'm sure you know that, which is why I'm confused) 
Great point about moving the coins around, I have no idea how that could be handled at that scale.
Is it possible for Amazon to accept bitcoin before they have another utility for it? 
If Amazon began accepting Bitcoin tomorrow, they would be taking a loss if they have to dump it right back on the market. If they're lucky they break even. They need to give the price time to rise after their endorsement to ensure it's a profitable avenue.
I think that if they announce a plan to accept bitcoin in the near future and work to help with teaching the masses about bitcoin, then they can profit. They can probably more or less single-handedly stimulate the business to business bitcoin economy. Convince their manufacturers and suppliers to accept Bitcoin as payment, allowing them to not have to dump the coins on the market and watching the price rise like balloon.

Man I have been stuck on level 4 for awhile. 
I understand that the blockchain protocol can create a distributed consensus system but I don't get how that can be applied when you remove incentivization and a valuable underlying asset to the network-securing process. 
Any chance you could point me in the right direction?
@_date: 2014-08-25 15:18:33
But do you think it is an obstacle for mass adoption?
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:47:48
Lots of localbitcoins' sellers use Bank of America deposit, which I do not think you need to be 18 to use.
@_date: 2014-08-25 15:09:40
Is there a reason for that? Other than people just not wanting to hear anything bad about Bitcoin? Are there plans by the devs to improve this at some point?
On that note I have another question: How practical would the application of a hard fork really be? 
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:53:42
What you are saying is true, assuming buy ads never get filled at market rates. I don't know if they do so I will not argue further. 
Only one way to find out I guess!
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:45:30
It's not simple enough yet. It takes a *minimum* of 2-3 separate sit-down, several hour discussions for most people I explain Bitcoin to to have a strong enough grasp to have an opinion on and/or be able to go out and acquire and transact with Bitcoin safely.
90% of people won't even let the conversation go on past the 1st few sentences due to thinking it's a scam or they don't understand it at all and don't care to.
50% of the remainder don't have much if any tech background forcing explanations to start 3 steps further back than it may have taken some of us when we began.
That leaves 5% of people, 1 in 20 people (being VERY generous) I mention Bitcoin to will even be able to attempt to understand it. 
Now you need to:
- Engage them
- Keep them interested 
- Concisely answer and explain a complex and entirely new concept...
...for something that has at least an equal chance to fail as it has to succeed. Something that provides them minimal benefit in its *current* utility relative to the amount of effort they would need to invest.
But if tomorrow Amazon decides to accept bitcoin + a very simple exchange-wallet combo that's as secure as cold storage is released, people wouldn't need the explanation. 
"Hey did you hear about the new digital money you can use to buy stuff on amazon? It's cheaper than my bank account and super fast!" 
These 2 sentences would be more than enough to get your average joe to jump on board. Incentive (save money), backing (Amazon) and simplicity all in the span of a 2 minute conversation. 
Sigh...a man can dream. For now I just keep fighting the good fight.
@_date: 2014-12-05 06:53:13
This is getting super pedantic, but my point was that theoretically (more like conspiratorially) all the increase in transaction volume has been spam. Since people put so much weight on that metric it is plausible, albeit unlikely, that someone(s) has/have been inflating that number for a long time.

That's great! I'm gonna need to speak to my accountant soon :)

Is that what people are doing and that causes it?
@_date: 2014-12-09 02:50:47
So in your car selling example, would the car title represent a token within itself? 
Or would the details of the transaction be input separately (a feature that currently does not exist in bitcoin).
Also, when you say the miners could be paid mining fees in bitcoin, is that a scenario you are giving for a situation where it is implemented as a bitcoin sidechain? (as opposed to being its own crypto)
Thanks for your help man.
