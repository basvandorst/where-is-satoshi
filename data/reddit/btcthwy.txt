But cashing out - no is my understanding.
"Using Bitcoin to pay for personal transactions
Generally, there will be no income tax or GST implications if you are not in business or carrying on an enterprise and you simply pay for goods or services in bitcoin (for example, acquiring personal goods or services on the internet using Bitcoin). Where you use bitcoin to purchase goods or services for personal use or consumption, any capital gain or loss from disposal of the bitcoin will be disregarded (as a personal use asset) provided the cost of the bitcoin is $10,000 or less."

I have actually been spending reasonably hard.  Just not enough I need to spend on.
The story last week about a bot scanning for insecure wallets was enough to finally get me off my ass to do something.
Most of the stuff moved is going to a wallet on a fresh (debian jessie) kvm setup which is going to be secured offline on a large high quality usb stick.  Yes the wallet is also backed up elsewhere.
Going to leave the orginal wallet alive with some in it as another spending wallet.  And so I can have a play with some things.

I am past doing it technically, but some sort of scheduling/logistics analysis could be/needs to be done showing that even without full blocks all the time what mostly full blocks with demand spikes will do to the network.
If it is anything like other networks, unpredictable and undesirable behaviour will result above some threshold when demand spikes drive the system into contention. Small delays will propagate and perhaps magnify.
But that is feel, there are math and simulation tools for this type of problem.

Specifically a wallet can receive btc to more than one address, but when spending, unless you do something like use the coin control options in bitcoin-qt, the wallet software will use various transaction outputs as inputs and mix.  So by putting some notional amount in high profile wallets, they can may be able to see what else is being held in a wallet when a transaction occurs. 
Also I am guessing if you wanted to do a mapping process/experiment, having known inputs to start your trace from could be useful, depending on what you are trying to accomplish

No imagine I created some other addresses in the wallet.
If I didn't use the coin control software, next transaction would grab the higher priority coins until it had enough. If there were other addresses at a higher priority, but not part of those it would get mixed and exposed.
Eventually it would grab factom's spam and expose the other addresses held.

Possibly in slashdot journals, which weren't indexed then (and now?).
Given what I limited myself to online, /. is most likely.

1. What makes you think I didn't sell some. HODL until relieved. But check some of the weekly spend threads.
2. No need.
3. A few months. Cpu mining was always going to be a small window of opportunity and I wasn't going to play in the mining arms race.
4. Slashdot probably. I was looking at zero knowledge proofs and someone mentioned bitcoin as an option.

Found the problem.  bitcoin-qt doesn't offer the coinbase transactions in the gui.  Copy and paste and is good.
Without the quote marks
"Hello from btcthwy 23 Sep 2015"
Signed against 1CgrbzKje66Pcz1egaAnhr7qEGfdk9atS2
Also saying hi to the folks at bitcointalk, address above is one 1 spent from in 2014
And from the recent transaction, against 112qJLTCR3QGVyQ6RBH2765gw3gVozBhvU with the quote marks
" btcthwy 23/9/2015"

It has occurred to me it is possible.  Hence the pseudonym.
At least one person who comes here should know my other handle.  But that is just the way I like it.

As I said elsewhere the ui in bitcoin-qt doesn't let you sign a message against coinbase transactions. I have tried.
Unless you can point to a process description for dumping the keys and signing or showing I am wrong, you are going to have to live with what I posted.
The disk is unplugged now and vm obviously off. So take your time if you care.

Cashing them out in bulk is always going to be a challenge, even if you had squeaky clean coins you mined yourself.  Just the size is going to trigger money laundering warnings.
Can you use a service to use them up slowly - eg Gyft, e-gifter, etc.  Or do you just want out?

Think about autonomous weapons systems.  I don't want them, not many people do.
But they probably will come and we do want them relatively impervious to having their targets altered without appropriate authorisation.  Bonus, blockchain type authorisation would mean the chain of command could confirm who authorised what targets - eg hospital (assuming everything is encrypted and only those with the keys could check and change this stuff).

I am more interested in the fact that stratfor is representing itself in this space.
Stratfor was not breached in order to obtain customer credit card numbers, which the hackers in question could not have expected to be as easily obtainable as they were. Rather, the operation was pursued in order to obtain the 2.7 million e-mails that exist on the firm's servers. This wealth of data includes correspondence with untold thousands of contacts who have spoken to Stratfor's employees off the record over more than a decade. Many of those contacts work for major corporations within the intelligence and military contracting sectors, government agencies, and other institutions for "
That is who stratfor gets paid by.  Why the interest? Who is asking?
