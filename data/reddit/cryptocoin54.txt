What about mined altcoins like ETH which I sold for BTC. There is no proof of where that money comes from.

To transfer the maximum amount in the wallet, just put an exclamation mark in the amount field (it is explained in the help section).

You did everything right. I bought 5.5 BTC relatively cheap and sold 1 at 13k to get my investment back. No matter what happens, 4.5 BTC are working for me. Even if it crashes to 1k (which I don't believe will happen), I have no loss...

All you need is a wallet like [Electrum]( You can receive your coins and save them until you're old enough to legit your ID with an exchange.

Ordered one and paid with BTC.

Definitely yes! I started about a year ago  bought a little time over time and am making a ROI of about 85% since then. It's fun to ride a rollercoaster :-)

Your trading volume is not important. You can do as much as you want. The only thing that interests the federal bank is what you get paid out (maybe also what you buy, but im not sure). Well, Im only a very small participant in the market, althought this might change soon...

Just FYI, kraken has their german account at the same bank as bitcoin.de. I have my account there too for convenience (I live in germany). When selling bitcoins, I do not get the notification about informing the federal bank if I transact more than 12.5 k €. Last year I bought and sold my coins at anycoindirect in the netherlands and got this info every time I sold BTC for EUR.
