That's technically theft or seizing and not confiscation, I believe. The key difference being authority. Since no single person, organization, or government has authority over the Bitcoin blockchain, no one can technically confiscate it they can only seize it or steal it. That's the difference in the two definitions; you have to have authority to confiscate it by definition. They can seize your private key but if you have it stored in your head as well as in a wallet of some sort it's still accessible by anyone with the private key.   
Could be wrong, but that is how I've come to understand the difference between seize and confiscate by the dictionary definition.

They seized the private keys that allowed them to access the Bitcoins, but they didn't actual seize the Bitcoins themselves. You can confiscate my computer that I email on. That doesn't mean you confiscated my emails. Anyone with the private key\(s\) to those Bitcoins, owns them. What other currency or items of value, such as gold, has that capability? The capability of being everywhere at the same time and accessible to anyone with the "password."

Yeah, I absolutely agree GeneralZex. I mentioned that in one of my comments above. The private key can be owned by multiple people. So you can confiscate my hardware wallet with my private key but if I have that private key somewhere else or in my head I still own it also. All they are confiscating is a string of numbers and letters and not any actually Bitcoin. 
In regards to your other point, it depends I think how they go about getting your private key. If a person specifically targets your private key then chances are they know once they have it they’ll need to move it ASAP. If the police or whoever just raided my house and found my private keys somewhere they probably wouldn’t know they need to move the Bitcoins to another wallet to avoid me doing it first. If it’s a federal agency taking it, then ya I think they’d know or find out very quickly that they need to move it.

I think the only good thing about RH entering the space is the increase in liquidity it'll bring to those currencies. Wouldn't be surprised if the vast majority of people who'll use RH to trade will even know what a private key is. Nor will they understand the importance of controlling their own funds... sad.

True! I will add this.

Does come in 8 different colors as well. Like grey and blue if you’re trying to get real crazy.

Yeah that is true. If the government steals something and says it was legal then ya it isn't technically theft because they determine the law. Nonetheless though, that is a weaker part of the non\-confiscatable argument. You can't confiscate an actual Bitcoin.

Wouldn't be surprised if 2014 to 2018 is added to this, gets redesigned as Btrash, and ends up on bitcoin dot com ....

In addition to my point about authority to RoseDrgaonAngelus; which I think is the difference between confiscating and stealing. Is it not also true that Bitcoins can't be confiscated because they themselves are on the blockchain and not physically on a hardware or online wallet? So the government or persons who seize your private key are only holding your private key and not your actual Bitcoin. 
If you have your private key stored in your head for example and the government takes your hardware wallet with your private key, you are still able to transact and move your Bitcoin around. As long as you do it before they do it.
It's like an email address. Can the government confiscate your emails? No. They can hijack your account, change the password, or delete the email so you can't access them. But that's not the definition of confiscation. You could still access that email from anywhere where there's internet. 
Down the rabbit hole we go.

That’s a good point, bitroll. I agree with you that currency should be measured by goods it can buy. Isn’t it also true though that if we’re talking about storing value then you would compare other currencies with each other to determine if it’s a good store of value relative to the other options? The goods would be the common denominator in the equation but the comparison of what is the better store of value would be the numerator component. 
Like you said with Venezuela, if their option is the USD or the VEF, then the USD would be a better store of value cause it can maintain its purchasing power better. 
So in other words, the store of value argument is not so much an easy green check mark, but rather depends on a case-by-case basis.

The non-confiscatable fact isn’t to say Bitcoins are therefor safe from the government. They aren’t by any means. And the title of the comparison is paper money not numbers on a computer screen. Most of that money doesn’t actually exist in the real world.

Hi Mertsa, That’s a false equivalency though. Because a dollar in someone’s hand is only able to be used by that person who carries it. If you find out my private key that stores my Bitcoins you haven’t taken my Bitcoins until it’s moved to a place I can’t access. Whereas if you take my cash it’s a physical thing that’s only retrievable at the location it’s presently at. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:36:09
Hey Bzxzp, I can understand where you’re coming from. But if the USD is performing better than some other currencies and thus is increasing purchasing power to some extent depending on where you’re using it, isn’t it storing value? Not saying it is storing value better than other things but is storing value to a certain degree.

Yeah, I agree baldbrody. Hard to convey exactly what I was thinking. The government can seize anything cause, well, they are the government and make the laws. I’m just going off the dictionary definition of confiscate, which implies authority over someone; whereas seize is to take by force. If you’re residing or visiting a country, then that government has authority over you in some capacity. So to rephrase, I think the government can confiscate your belongings, including currency (regardless of origin) and your private keys, whether they be on a hardware wallet, paper, computer, etc. But they can’t confiscate actual Bitcoins. They can only confiscate the keys sort of speak. I believe that is what people mean when they say Bitcoin is non-confiscatable.
