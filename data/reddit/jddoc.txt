They'll regulate it.

Thanks for the informative answer!

We're talking Stores of Value here, right?
I don't keep all of my CURRENCY in savings. 
REAL HUMANS do this:
1.  Immediate use- checking
2. Short-term need - Savings.  Savings accounts typically have a minimum balance, AND limit the number of transactions out per quarter.  But yes, I can pull cash out without a penalty up to 4 times IF the need arose.
3. CDs.  Not touching this for 6 months, or a year - now we're beating inflation.  Can't pull the money without a penalty, but it's there in a DIRE emergency.
4. Mutual funds - Bond, Stock.  Greatly outpace inflation, but subject to risk. (market crashes, recessions).  You can get in or out of these as you please BUT - fees to get in, taxes on growth coming out.
This is what people do with their FIAT.  This is the REAL WORLD application.  it easily outpaces inflation.
As we age, we move more and more into "safer" investments like cash that yes, are subject to inflation- but by then, it hardly matters.  We aren't worried about inflation when we're 80.
As for BitCoin- every purchase you make with BitCoin, you MUST PAY Capital Gains on any growth or you are breaking the LAW.  You want to track that for every purchase? Insane.
@_date: 2019-03-17 19:05:43
You're absolutely right - this would be a US citizen issue.
In the US, If you just do wallet-to-wallet and skip exchanges, you'd still be fine.
If you find some way to store fiat and pay the exchange from this non-US/Canadian bank, US citizens will be able to buy BTC.
The problem is that's all a major headache, and yes I think it would cause the US adoption to slow if not drop.
Right now- not an issue.  The question was "what would kill BitCoin" -and my answer is still government regulation.
As for the online casinos - the US put the burden on the service providers to block those sites.  So yeah, no US business for them.  That I imagine is exactly how it would work with the Exchanges.
I can't speak to European governments.  But if they chose to regulate, do you see issues like the ones I describe in my previous post?
@_date: 2019-03-16 20:41:17
So I can copy it and give it to my friends, like an MP3 file?

Dang the Dollar really increased in value in 2018. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 03:18:57
So let's be clear:
Because I stated facts and actual examples, you blame me personally for those facts.
You read something that scared you, and you turned into a name-calling, shit-flinging chimp that lost the ability to type a clear sentence, let alone form a coherent thought.
There are a lot of FACTS out there that you won't like.  Freaking out at the messenger won't give you the solutions you want.
Go change your pants, and come back when you can rationally discuss issues without wetting yourself.
@_date: 2019-03-18 01:29:37
Not a ban- strict enforcement of the capital gains taxes that the US / Europe / all western nations apply.
It's easy to block a website (exchange) if they don't play ball.  It's easy to prosecute an individual if they don't file taxes.
It will always be legal to buy / sell bitCoin - but it might be DIFFICULT and not worth the effort.
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:11:29
1. All purchases of BitCoin must be recorded for tax purposes.  We require you to show purchase price, and sales price and pay taxes on any capital gains.
This is current law.  If the IRS decides to really pursue this all they have to do is say "hey we see movement from your bank account to exchange X of $10k.  Where's your tax statement from the exchange for 2018?"
You don't have one.  At that point, you discover something terrifying: with the IRS, you're guilty until proven innocent.  They can and will fuck your life up.
They can also turn to the exchange in question and say "If you're going to do business with the US, we REQUIRE these tax docs submitted annually no later than Feb 14 of each year."
Now, the exchange in question can give a big middle finger to the US if they are out-of-country, but the online casinos did that and guess how that turned out for them?
Don't kid yourself.  It's a matter of Will.  Right now, the IRS / US Govt. is a sleeping giant.  But if they get the Will to regulate BitCoin, they can exert astonishing force to do it.
@_date: 2019-03-18 15:21:08
1. Yep.  The pirate bay and whole host of other sites.
2. It's simple.  Yo take their house ,car and garnish their paycheck is the typical method for small-time offenders.  Big-time offenders go to jail.  So congrats, you keep your crypto but lose your freedom for 10 years for tax-evasion.  
Yes, that would have an impact on US adoption.   
It hasn't happened, so we're whistling in the wind for now.

I’m concerned about the complete lack of oversight or regulation you’re envisioning working. It won’t survive contact with the real world

Health warning for non economists: This video takes some obvious truths about what money is (it represents obligation, ie debt, but is transferable) and uses semantics to imply that this is necessarily bad. The description of the process of fractional reserve is factually incorrect - reserves available are almost never a binding constraint on banks' lending. A good description of the process of modern money creation can be found here:
[Money creation in the modern economy](
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:13:52
Let me start off by saying I hope you're having a great day and I respect your stance on BTC, but I do not agree with it.
In your first sentence you say "It's easier to create a *regulated* and safe system with digital money..."
Then you say "The beauty of bitcoin is that it works without borders or *regulations*..."
You can't have your cake and eat it too.  BTC is NOT regulated. So no, it is not in any way "easier" to create a "safe system".  Your safe system has these flaws:
1. If you lose your keys your money is gone FOREVER.  You have NO RECOURSE.
2. If you use an exchange, and that exchange collapses, you have NO RECOURSE.
3. If you make a purchase from a vendor and the vendor does not make good on the purchase, YOU HAVE NO RECOURSE.  You can show "I paid from address X to address Y" but you have no way to prove the vendor is the owner of that address.
4. BTC has been proven to be the victim of price manipulation.  We had another BART take place last week.  Remember the pop to $4000 and the subsequent drop?  This is happening over and over.  It's well-documented.
5.  You are doing a tiny percentage of the traffic that VISA does, yet blockchain is burning more power than the entire country of Portugal.  It's insane, inefficient and irresponsible.  BTC manages a few transactions per second.  VISA does 24000 transactions per second.  
6.  You mention COBOL and antiquated systems.  Blockchain is a LINKED LIST.  THAT is ANCIENT, horribly inefficient tech.
There will be a cryptocurrency.  This I believe.  But it won't be the awful implementation that is Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2019-02-26 19:45:14
Correct- no dispute there.  But the bank is not printing $10 new dollars for every dollar I deposit.

I hate this myth.  It's the literal truth, I grant you - but it has ZERO real-world application.  It's a lie of omission.
If you stick your US dollars in a shoebox. yes, they will lose value over time.
But people use BANKS, with SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, which pay interest.
If they have significant savings at all, they buy a CD. Or a US savings bond.  Or any other investment vehicle.
NO ONE has their entire life savings sitting in a box under their bed.  No one that has savings leaves it all sitting in a checking account.
These examples always exclude the real world.  They lie by omission.
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:50:36
I love you, but I don't trust you.  Sure, you're great now, but in 10 years you might change. I might change.  So while I love you, I don't trust you enough to buy a house with you.  I don't trust you enough to mix assets because I am SO AFRAID and FEARFUL that this might not work out.
So while I love you, I'm going to go to great lengths to see to it that you have no access to my finances, and I have no access to yours.  We're going to own 1/2 of the house, or better yet live separately because while I love you NOW, you might hurt me later.
Love. trust. Respect.  A relationship needs all 3.
What you are describing is some frightened child's nightmare of a relationship. 
No fucking way.  Do it right or don't do it at all.  But don't ever go in for that unholy abomination of distrust you're calling love.
You don't have to get the paper- who cares.  But shit, if I kick the bucket I want my SO cared for.  And I don't need to be so afraid of the future that I can't just build a life with her and NOT WORRY about distribution of assets.
It's easy.  Everything is OURS.  Because we love each other, we trust each other, and we respect each other.  And we sure as hell aren't going to let some boogeyman of possible future divorce fuck that up now.
You go your way.  I'll go mine.
Best of luck.

Starting a conversation urging someone to buy something they have no practical use for  is not the way to go about this.  Telling them "Buy now let's get rich" is definitely not the message you want to send - buy now, then dump after it goes up?
If the product is good, and serves a purpose, it will succeed.  BitCoin doesn't need evangelists.  it needs to prove its use to the *general public* in a clear way that doesn't require some raving zealot trying to sell it like snake oil.
If it's easier to use than VISA, people will use it rather than VISA.  If it's easier to use than ApplePay, people will use it rather than ApplePay.
That just isn't the case right now.  Work on those use cases, and it will grow organically.

Common law will do all that anyway. Not being married won’t save you. 
But as for a “Marriage is better than just living together, sharing assets, to buy a house, having kids” I really don’t have that?  It’s just...marriage. You’re still going to get gutted like you were married if you mix assets or have kids, so...why not?

Windows 10 with Windows Defender does seem very secure, I have to admit.

@_date: 2019-04-10 17:17:13
Yeah I don't agree at all.  I get that you have some bitter experience there, but for many marriage works.
You do you.  But the blanket "marriage BAD" is nonsense.  I've seen a marriage where it went to hell and the guy was clearly, obviously the bad actor.  But the other divorces...a little from column A, a little from column B.
it isn't always A is good and B was evil.   Sometimes people grow and change and it just doesn't work out.  Really, I think that's most divorces.
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:28:16


Really, that's not something I can answer for you.  You have to decide when you want to commit to another person.
I don't know you.  But you come across as someone that needs to go slow in their relationships and build trust.  That's fine - smart even for anyone.
When it's right, then it's time to commit.   That's a decision for any two people to make when they are ready.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:33:35
Well, if you treat the marriage like it runs on autopilot you might have trouble, yeah?
You aren't strangers.  If you're drifting apart you work on that.
Marriage is a machine that takes maintenance.  Ignore it or take it for granted you will have trouble, no doubt.
My divorced friends always say the same thing right after it happens: "i should have seen the signs."  Yeah, they were there, but you fell into routine and ignored them.
I've seen some stories on Reddit about how the guy or girl suddenly moves out after 8 years etc.  They are shocked- no signs this was coming.  If you talk to their friends...yeah we saw it coming.  the signs were right there in your face for years...and you did nothing.
Have hope.  The married couples we know are very happy, college-educated or not.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:28:37
And now you're going to blame me, or attack my wife, whom you've never met.
Yes, you made the statement.  My message is the same:  Your life can improve, but only if you work on yourself.
"It's not me, it's them" is the cowards way out and will not lead to an improvement in your life.

Lot of very sad people here.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:15:06
1. If I love someone, I commit myself to that person.  I don't see a way to separate the two.  if she is sick, I will stay and take care of her, even though it might be a nightmare of cancer, or the slow decline of old age.  We pool our resources / incomes to build a life together.  We commit.
2. Are you just talking about marriage?  Or the legal trappings thereof?  If that's the case then sure, cohabit happily until you don't.
I think maybe we're using the same term commitment to mean two separate things? Is it 1. you object to, or 2?
@_date: 2019-04-29 22:08:09
You pay the same costs whether you pay cash, bitcoin or Visa.
The price is the price.
This is a nonsense argument.
Really, the crypto crowd need to stop the hate train on Visa.  Fraud protection has real value.  You don't gain adherents attacking Visa and fraud protection.
Focus on expounding on the benefits of your system, rather than trying to drag Visa down.
BTC has its issues.  Address those, grow organically.
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:07:20
To each their own.  Some people are not meant for marriage I grant you.
But sharing your life with someone else can also be magical.
I'd rather have these 25 years of life with my wife than 1000 years without her.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:06:31
My time to shine!  Your numbers are way off my friend.
Divorce is a tricky thing to track, but the rules change depending on age and socio-economic status.
Example:  if you and your prospective partner are 26+ years old college graduates with jobs, you have an 80% chance of going the distance!
Example 2:  If you are 18, getting married because your SO is pregnant and one of you has a substance abuse problem, your odds drop down to the 10-20% range.
Divorcees are MUCH more likely to divorce a 2nd time.  Prevailing theories: Divorcees are much less likely to put up with BS the 2nd time around, or some carry the same personal problems from the first relationship right to the 2nd with the same results.
You can read in detail about divorce in the US at us.census.gov.
Really- Marriage is an awesome thing with a good success chance if you're ready for it / marry the right person.
@_date: 2019-04-30 14:09:21
1. Agree with point 1.
2. Agree with point 2.  Is the cost worth the convenience for merchants and purchasers? i would argue yes, especially in the age of the internet.
3. Not addressed.  BitCoin and the exchanges are fundamentally flawed.  Hiding from the facts that it's a rapidly fluctuating, manipulated currency that is difficult for the layman to use with shit for transaction speed, easily hacked exchanges with NO oversight, rampant fraud,  and an insane carbon footprint has NOT been addressed.  Fix your broken coin, and you'll see adoption.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:30:05
Ok then I think we're violently in agreement.
I'm married, I like it, but no it is not for everyone.
I will say again divorce rates are not 50%, let alone 70%.  it depends on the socio-economic group.  Some groups are at 80-90% and some divorce rates are &lt; 15%.  You  can't pick any given couple and say "Oh they have an x% chance of divorce." You can say "given this education bracket, and these employment stats, and this age difference, and as far we we know no prior jail/substance abuse issues, they have a 20% chance of divorce."
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:13:15
This is just not true at all.

@_date: 2019-01-19 06:12:51
No disagreement with this statement. 
My opinion is that by its nature it will not stabilize but will instead bubble out. 
If the price shot up to 20k usd per coin next week, how many folks here would cash out?  50% of owners?  90%?
Or would you argue they would all hold?

Excellent explanation and info - thank you!
@_date: 2019-01-18 22:57:22
Excellent response - thank you!
As to your question - let the Games Begin!
1. I believe that A Cryptocurrency will emerge, but I don't think it will be bitcoin.  Bitcoin, IMHO, is a pyramid that has people buying in not to use Crypto, but to see an investment rise in value so they in turn get rich.  The coins themselves have no reason to increase in value other than demand.  This means many people lose, while a few will get rich.  This shows all the signs of a bubble that will eventually pop, leaving the last BTC holders with low-value crypto.
2. The Cryptocurrency of the future will have stable value.  You won't buy it to increase your wealth - you'll buy it to *buy things*.  It will be redeemable for $USD, or Euros or Yen or whatever easily, through decentralized exchanges OR standard banks.  I don't see the people of the US latching on to it (we have fairly reasonable fees around CC purchases), but I do see huge potential internationally.
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:04:09
Ok, so your point is bitcoin is not yet ready to be a store of value but someday it will?
I agree with you on $usd being a poor store of value over time due to inflation. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:26:21
Ok, so not a currency then,  because of the stability issues. You view it as an investment that will increase in value over time. 
If that’s the case, why would it ever displace fiat currencies?
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:47:45
1.  A store of value is currency. 
2.  Stable doesn’t mean backed. It means having a currency that doesn’t have massive value fluctuations short term and does not suffer value manipulation by bad actors. Can bitcoin make those claims?
3.  You like to throw a lot of insults in your responses.  Try to be civil.
@_date: 2019-01-19 06:39:14
Yep. No argument there. 
The US dollar goes up in value vs other currencies when the fed stops adding to the money supply or increases interest rates or when GDP goes up.
