I dont believe in giving to the poor, all it does is make the poor dependent on aids, see food stamps and african aids

In Thailand, we enter Med school ( med college of med department of a university ) right after graduating highschools
so I finished highschools at 18 and enrolled in a med college for 6 years ( since we didn't need to have the 4 years of science major college + 4 more medical schools like in the states )
I'm pretty millennial so I wanna do some crypto and diversify my money

i'm still curious about " Seeds " if i were to drop my hardwallet into a sink or a toilet, how would the Seeds work?
how are my keys protected? and how would the seeds recover my wallet and it's keys if the hardware were to malfunction
@_date: 2019-04-05 04:23:52
that ruins the whole point of this post
@_date: 2019-04-05 04:23:41
who again now?
@_date: 2019-04-11 06:33:32
I still have questions regarding seeds.
how does it recover my bitcoins if i were to lose my PC/phones, etc
i understand that it creates the same wallet, but how does that recover my keys ? in my head it's just like receiving the same wallet, but the actually wallet + its content would be lost
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:05:46
what are keys like? i see people posting their wallets online, i assume those are different things
the random long string of letters
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:01:34
what's with this pointless sarcasm?
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:07:04
I have some money i'm ok with losing
@_date: 2019-04-05 09:24:55
I havent bought any yet as im seeing the trend going down
I just didnt think it would recover going below 4000

1. TIL the derivatives are called altcoins*
2. I was planning to only do BTC and Ethereum
3. I would like to know more about Bitcoin Cash, it seems second to BTC in the trading websites, if it's truly a scam, why is it still there
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:58:47
How broken
not in how bad, but broken in what way? + is that the reason for new derivatives?

the concept of withdrawing into a cold wallet is very foreign to me.
how can u take bitcoins offline?
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:09:29
so cold wallets is basically like a flashdrive with a notepad of the string of letters being the key?
and, what did people mean by withdraw my coins into my wallet and not leave it in exchange ?
@_date: 2019-04-05 04:23:59
what that?
@_date: 2019-04-11 06:29:52
I've downloaded electrum, but i havent send any coins to it yet
@_date: 2019-04-10 21:33:56
I have a question
If i were to left it disconnected for an extended period of time making the battery run oit
What becomes of the wallet?
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:54:22
I mean if the transaction itself isn't making someone richer, would it just be a new bitcoin V2 with some extra stuff?
sure they are pushing it, but is it just like the makers want it to be popular
@_date: 2019-04-11 06:29:59
Which one, lel
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:06:50

I can't use coinbase to buy bitcoins apparently due to my country blocking or so
@_date: 2019-04-11 11:31:40
How can the seed i get from when i created the wallet know what keys i have when i lost it?
@_date: 2019-04-04 09:24:41
Coinbase is pretty popular, i download it on my phone, but it says my country doesn't allow transaction thru it yet. So i have to buy bitcoins elsewhere? at this point should i just delete coinbase, since i can't use it for buying/selling?
