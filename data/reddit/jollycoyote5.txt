There is a cap on the max supply. Yes, supply is (very slowly) *until the cap*. There is no cap on fiat.
I should've said "invest" it. Yes, people will obviously spend money on essentials. What's the incentive to invest money in places like the stock market or real estate if your cash will grow on its own?
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:01:33
I have to use USD to pay sales, income, property, etc. Tax. Not bitcoin. Until then I'd have to use two currencies if wanted to both use Bitcoin and pay my taxes. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 20:25:32
One of the reasons. Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not.
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:09:42
But how does that fix a horribly mismanaged economy? A handful of people stay rich or get richer, that doesn't fix the country's problems, right?
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:28:51
Cool thanks for the opinion. I have a few more questions, if you'd be willing to answer. :)
1. Why, in your opinion, do you think CryptoCurrency well be the future?
2. Isn't cash the same though? If I have cash I control my own money and buy things relatively anonymously. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:05:18
I posted this elsewhere in this thread, but why on earth would anyone want currencies to gain value at the rate BTC has? One of the main features of currency is that they're relatively stable.
Why spend $100 worth of bitcoin today if you think it’s going to be worth $5,500 in the next few years?
Sure, BTC was a good speculative investment. But not a currency.
Side note: You're still measuring prices and gains in fiat.
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:25:48
That still doesn't explain why having a deflationary currency is beneficial. People would be encouraged to hoard the currency instead of spending it.
@_date: 2018-08-01 15:04:40
But why would someone deal with that hassle (selling BTC for their local currency to pay taxes) instead of using their local currency for everything (both purchases and taxes) in the first place? 
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:21:45
All but 1 CryptoCurrency (BTC, LTC, DASH, ETH, etc.) ATM in North America charges fees according to Coin ATM Radar, with an average fee (Across 1,825 ATMs users have reported fees) of 8.46%. Most ATMs have fees between 5% and 10%.
More info here: [
But, there are no ATMs in Portsmouth. So you've been to this shop before and they didn't charge any markups? 
(I hope you can see why I'm skeptical, haha, I've visited a couple of these recently and they all had pretty high fees.)
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:40:42
I agree with you that if BTC gets mass adoption and market value continues to rise it could stabilize. But that's a big "if" in my book. Whether or not it happens in the future, or whether another cryptocurrency takes BTC's place, is the source of a lot of speculation right now.
My point is that what we know about Bitcoin today, along with historical data, indicates that it has been a poor currency. Including UniqueCandy's implication that Bitcoin rising 100% in a year makes it a better currency than the Lira.
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:34:46
Cool, didn't know that. Thanks!  That also sounds fun, maybe I'll be a Bolivar millionaire tonight.
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:12:52
I understand your negative behavior example, people who messed up can't just print more money to fix their problems. However, I don't see how bitcoin rewards good behavior. Could you explain that a little more?
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:55:16
How is that a case for Bitcoin being a good currency?
BTC is down 60% YTD, but up 100% in the last 12 months. That's incredibly unstable.
If you zoom out further, BTC is up \~55x in the last 5 years. What about that makes it a good currency? Why spend $100 worth of bitcoin today if you think it’s going to be worth $5,500 in the next few years?
All that would lead to is people hoarding their "currency" instead of investing it in businesses, property, etc. that in turn fuels the economy (how Fiat works now).
I'm still new to all this, but that part doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:07:49


What have they been using instead? Not trying to contradict, just wondering.
@_date: 2018-08-02 01:53:28
Not trying to over simplify your argument, just trying to figure out all this. It seems like you're saying the reasons people would deal with flipping between cash and BTC is if they're either:
1. Speculating on BTC
2. A Bitcoin/CryptoCurrency true believer
Is that right?
Am I missing anything? I'm still kinda new, trying to wrap my brain around this. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:42:49
Why do you think it will make it that high (and stay there)?
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:07:47
That's it?
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:38:22
1. That's a good point, it doesn't need to happen overnight. And it'd probably happen quite slowly.
2. Sorry if I've been jumping around on topics here, I don't mean to keep moving the goal posts. This has all been a lot to process. I guess my main theme is that most of what BTC offers, can be found in one or another different product that already exists. But, to your point, there is no single product today that has similar pros/cons to BTC (other than BTC). 
3. Fair enough.  Fiat will almost always, and has in the past, inflate. I do like that BTC's supply is set in stone, but as I mentioned (but didn't really explain), I'm not sure that this quality would make it a good thing to spend as money. If I had a good idea that BTC would increase in price, it'd be in my best interest to hold on to it and spend an inflationary currency (like fiat). Heck, the fact that fiat inflates might even encourage people to spend and use it in everyday transactions, since savers are punished by their savings losing value.
4. Okay, that's interesting. I can see how that may apply though. There are already developing countries that have totally skipped things like landline telephones and went straight to cellphones. Skipping over the technology that's no longer relevant because of improvements.
5. No problem man! I figured it was something like that. I've seen that there's a lot of drama between the two communities, but don't know the reason for any of it. That'll probably be the next rabbit hole.
Thanks for all of your responses by the way. This has been very helpful.
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:49:36
I suggest you get educated on bitcoin before making posts such as these in the future. I don't think you should've invested in bitcoin in the first place if you don't understand such simple aspects of the protocol.
The fact that you think the block halving can be changed in the first place (regardless of such a greedy and self-serving reason) is mind boggling.
@_date: 2018-07-24 03:38:32
So clever.

How do they make money to pay rent, utilities, and salary?
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:01:25
I came in here to say this. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:05:57
I'm still new to all this, so bear with me. 
1. Where do you get the bitcoin? Even the whole exchange process and approval is a hassle for something you can just swipe a credit card for. Not even accounting for the price volatility (see 
2. Bitcoin is not private. Case and point: When I pay with a credit card, my sub shop doesn't know how much money I have in my bank account. Yours just needs to look at your address. Also, my autonomy is not being infringed on by my credit card company or bank.
3. A currency that inflates at 1%-3% per year is better than one with daily price swings of the same amount or more.  
4. That makes the assumption that those people aren't unbanked by choice, have enough cash to warrant a bank in the first place, have the ability to buy and spend BTC in the first place, that BTC will somehow improve what they're already doing, or that it doesn't introduce more problems than it solves.
5. Unsure how this applies to my question. That's not a reason to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:27:25
Why *does* buying and holding benefit everyone? (And by everyone, I mean everyone. Not just other people who have BTC.)
I'm kinda new here, but this doesn't make sense to me. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:44:59
Good addition bro.
@_date: 2018-07-29 03:10:18
Well, that, and the fact that the government requires us to pay any sales, income, property, and other taxes in USD...
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:53:27
Well, if the pizza guy thinks it'll be worth a million dollars one day... Haha.
In all seriousness, that's pretty freakin' cool of you! Great job getting adoption, surprising it was so easy for him to get all set-up on bitcoin. I should try that, sounds a lot easier than you'd think.
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:26:46
What's so bad about using third party tools? Venmo and Square are free, and you don't have to worry about typing in a crazy address or figuring out exchanges and wallets. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:00:54
Thanks for the response!
1. Why would someone who's never used BTC before switch to that instead of using fiat? Finding a job that pays in BTC, or finding a merchant that accepts BTC, is much harder than with fiat. I never said those things weren't possible with BTC, just that they required more effort than simply using fiat. Fiat is the standard (for better or worse).  
2. True, however I'd argue that it's still less anonymous than cash in many practical settings. My example still stands that by using BTC, the shop can look and see how much money you have. Not true if you had used cash or even a credit card.  
I'm still confused how this is infringing on my autonomy. It has the potential to, but it isn't. Things like you mentioned don't happen often, and I don't think most of the people using the current banking system really need to worry about their cards or accounts getting shut down unless they did something wrong. Even if that is a concern, wouldn't it make more sense to use a debit card or cash over BTC? I agree with you that BTC would be handy to have in a hyperinflation or recession/depression event. Then again, wouldn't the fiat currency of any country that *wasn't* going through that be just as useful? Or gold or silver?  
3. Bitcoin still hasn't proven to increase in value over time. It has in the past (well, excluding the last year), but that doesn't mean it will in the future. This seems more like speculation that price will increase. Which, don't get me wrong, is fine for a speculative investment/asset, but I don't think it's a useful quality for an everyday currency. I already have a tiny bit, but it's mostly to get used to it (and maybe a little speculation ;) ). As a currency, I don't want my sandwiches doubling in BTC price over the course of six months (the recent bitcoin price drop). I agree that price may stabilize as adoption increases, but I'm still not exactly sure how that'd work.   
4. In this instance you are correct. The unbanked cannot use Venmo. Apps don't work for everyone. I'll amend my statement in my first post to include only "people in industrialized countries with cellphones". I was merely pointing out that some of the unbanked are unbanked for a reason, and that reason may also omit a good chunk of them from being candidates for BTC as well. Someone without a cellphone or computer, or a job, or internet, or assets of any kind, can't use either of them. That's all.   
5. I don't agree with everything you say, but I don't think I've been combative. I'm skeptical and asking questions. I've been respectful and even agreed with you on some points. If I've come across that way, then I apologize.   
I found about CryptoCurrency a little while back and am coming at this with (in my opinion) a healthy dose of skepticism. I'm trying to find out *why* people who hold BTC believe the things they do. Hence my asking questions in the Bitcoin subs.  I've enjoyed our conversation so far and you've given me some things to think about. I don't want you to convince me to buy BTC, but I really do appreciate you taking the time out of your day to help talk me through some of these concepts.
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:18:37


Not to be rude, but isn't this all of what's driving the price of bitcoin right now?
@_date: 2018-07-30 21:46:51
Thanks for the response.
What do you call the wild bitcoin price volatility if not inflation/deflation? Sure, supply isn't changing. However, when compared to USD, BTC has lost over 50% of its purchasing power compared to the beginning of the year. USD has lost maybe 1%. Bitcoin fluctuates more than 1% on most *days.* 
I'm confused why lowering the circulating supply (by holding) will stabilize prices. It will decrease the supply and increase the price if demand remains constant. Is there some sort of principle in economics that explains the price stabilization effect? It seems like supply and demand need to reach an equilibrium, but I don't see how reducing supply (one side of the equation) will do it alone. Also, with $5.5 billion volume in the last 24 hours, and an average daily volume similar or higher, it doesn't seem like people are buying to hold.
How are people transacting in Bitcoin, but not selling it? In either case (buying a good or service with BTC, or speculating on an exchange) they trade BTC for something else. Giving someone else BTC for alpaca socks, video games, or USD.
If all people do is hold BTC, they wouldn't be buying goods or services with it either. The only way I can see price stabilizing without regard for demand is everybody gobbling up all the bitcoin, holding it, and then BTC price will have stabilized when there's no more in circulation, and it's worth the last price it was sold for (and will stay that way, because there's no more to sell).
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:42:42
ATMs charge fees though
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:20:19
Right. But it might not be in your neighbor's best interest to lend you money if he doesn't think you can pay it back. And if cash is scarce (nobody is printing billions of dollars over and over) then that becomes more likely. I think that's his point. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:30:29
But why would anyone deal with the hassle of learning how to use Bitcoin when the existing apps work for everyone who isn't doing anything illegal or needing to send money across boarders?
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:59:07
Do you have any examples of where these wealthy bitcoin philanthropists have shops selling BTC no fees? I'd definitely use them if there were any around me. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:25:54
How does buying BTC help humanity?
In fact, a case could be made that by you buying it early (assuming you aren't actually using the stuff), you're making it more expensive for the rest of humanity later on. Thereby acting in your own self interest.
