So you would sooner a roofer who never went to university pay taxes so you can go to university, to get a better paying job in the future. Why should he have to pay for you to live a better life? If you don’t value education at the cost of the student loan you shouldn’t be taking the course.

But when you treat the roofer are you being payed? Yes, even if it’s not by the roofer directly you’re being payed through his taxes anyway. So not only is he paying for his doctor’s education he’s also paying for their wages through taxes anyway. Or alternatively you could just get a loan on your education and then when the roofer falls of the roof he pays you for your service.

Not a mod, but more moderation is definitely needed. Apart from all the posts about the war with cash there’s tons of the same posts asking why transactions aren’t working, why it’s so expensive etc. 
Maybe we could a sticky on the current situation with the blockchain mods?
