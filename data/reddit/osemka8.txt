With you on this one. It's called gambling/speculating for a reason.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:11:35

@_date: 2019-08-29 12:54:48
Hot damn, you're bitter. Was that necessary?
@_date: 2019-08-29 07:54:24
1/(moon soon)=x
@_date: 2019-08-29 07:49:58
Moon soon. Maybe at noon, you goon ^(/s)
@_date: 2019-08-05 08:24:04
I highly doubt this will end good due to low volume
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:12:14
I meant lower than previous rallies. Phrased it wrong.
@_date: 2019-08-01 07:12:27
Me too! Where to?
@_date: 2019-08-28 11:51:46
The price is for the end of the month

Hey everyone, quick question. Bitcoin halving is scheduled somewhere in May 2020. What does that mean exactly? Mining reward will be lower, I understand, but since there will be more coins available, won't that lead to price drop?
@_date: 2019-08-13 10:31:05
@_date: 2019-08-29 08:40:55
I'm not clicking on anything with "dickline" in title at work
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:40:43
Drop it
@_date: 2019-08-28 11:36:41
Put /s there so noone will get rekt
@_date: 2019-08-29 06:15:08
I for one don't mind
@_date: 2019-10-28 12:19:35
Global warming.
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:38:24
Out of experience, what that brings acording to previous halvings?
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:39:24
28 &lt;3
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:22:45
It'll be interesting to see if alt money will come to BTC on Monday.
@_date: 2019-09-25 08:21:50
Jesus, hope it's not too painful in the end. Hope you take care of it asap.
@_date: 2019-09-24 07:10:53
No clue. Perhaps. Perhaps it's my grandma. Hell, it can be yours. Who knows.
@_date: 2019-09-24 07:44:17
Can I offer anyone a nice egg in this trying time?
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:16:19
I'm quite positive the correction is still not finished (looking at past cycles). Spike to 16k would be insane by the end of Oct, but what do I know.
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:12:32
Well, Anon said 16k in October, so...
@_date: 2019-09-22 17:53:28
Bakkt... hope the launch hype itself can be enought for ignition.
@_date: 2019-09-21 10:56:04
Strong support this 10k
@_date: 2019-09-26 07:15:22
Is this /s? IMO consolidation will continue
Edit: Oh. You are talking about 4chan, aren't you?
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:21:41
Hyping this event itself can be a great factor for spiking the price up.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:54:58
Holy fuck.
