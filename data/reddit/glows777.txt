I think we're all checking the prices a little too frequently but I sure wouldn't bet //against// it going to 3k by the end of the month.

Yeah I think that's really the right direction because you separated value and market price.  I'm a little skeptical about the 2500 part and think there might still be time for it to fluctuate down there but overall there are a lot of capital markets that still can flood into bitcoin, drastically increasing the per coin price.  If it doesn't hit 5k by the end of this year I'd be surprised.

Protip: on coinbase click "tools" then click "history"  then if you click your pending transactions you can see what date the credit for your account will finalize on.  Its good to know that even thought it can take like 5 days, you're locked in at the price at purchase so if it goes up, it still will help you.  Credit card is instant, bank transfers take forever, and I haven't played with wire transfer yets.  If you want to do quick trading and have a lot of liquid capital available, try putting a lot in GDAX so you can made lots of instant buys/sells (ironically the transfer of funds to GDAX takes like a week too).  Best of luck and welcome to the future.

Be warned: there is a funds checks the same/following business day so if you have insufficient funds it will cancel the sale even though it tends to not appear on your bank statement as a debit for a few days.
