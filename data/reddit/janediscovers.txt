While it's nice to see the EU Central Bank get its crypto\-comeuppances, here's a novel idea: Limit FUD with smart blockchain cyber security systems.
i searched the idea on the web and found some cool projects. one of them is [ which provides a smarter way of providing cybersecurity. it can use the Cyber Smart Coin from [ .
i can see projects like this helping people protect their bitcoin by providing better security for their computers, mobile devices, networks, etc.
by improving computer security, beyond just the blockchain itself, so that any passwords and other sensitive details stored on those computers are less at risk, the level of crypto\-related hacks should decrease, and therefore help dispel the fear, uncertainty and doubt that so many reactive reporters tend to focus on.

Is cheap bitcoin something you would shake a stick at?  Well lookie here ... It's the Annual BTC Fire Sale ... 2018 edition. My guess is this stuff goes up as it has done for years now, in the Summer.

Please point to where the report is wrong? How is Mr. Antonopolous not being a sexist hypocrite by on the one hand exploiting the work of one woman (Miley Cyrus) in order to drive his BTC agenda, while at the same time telling companies they should not hire booth babes at crypto conferences? I don't know or care about your beef with "bcash" people. I have nothing to do with that. I merely posted a video I found compelling. And for this, I get your insults? You're not very nice. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 19:16:04
It is no smear campaign. The video clearly shows what Andreas did and said, and made clear his anti-woman stance quite publicly. Why the resistance to calling it out? Seriously, I don't get it. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 07:47:21
I agree with the video, that Mr. Andreas Antonopolous should apologize to conference booth babes and the companies that hire them to work at cryptocurrency events and blockchain conferences. Especially because of the hypocrisy. Would love to see him apologize properly and move on with his credibility restored. Until then, I'm no longer buying his works or endorsing anything he's in. 
Everyone has freedom of choice, and that's mine for now. Too bad Mr. Antonopolous doesn't believe women should have the freedom to choose their mode of employment. And even worse, that he thinks it's ok for him to exploit women to advance his agenda, while he also thinks that it is not ok for anyone else to do so.  
The level of hypocrisy is staggering, especially for someone who has built his brand name on being a bitcoin evangelist and a blockchain promoter and author, speaking and writing about all of the freedom that this allegedly brings. However, apparently, this freedom does not extend to attractive and fit young women hired as "booth babes" who are usually subcontractors working for a modeling agency that is servicing a company's request for on-site associate representatives that can do a certain job that requires multiple skills, efforts and great positive energy, to perform successfully. 
Sorry girls, Bitcoin's Ubergeek doesn't want you in crypto, especially if you're pretty. He's not comfortable around beauty. He's socially inept and awkward, and the only way he knows how to cope with it is to cry and whine like a little baby, and have a hissy fit by email, until someone gives him what he wants. Apparently he never got over his pubescent anxieties about the fairer sex. And Andreas Antonopolous also apparently never got the message that this is 2019, and he does not have any right to tell women what jobs they can or can't have.
What a hypocrite.

yeah, right? i mean that never happened in any run on the banks in collapsing economies, right? :D :D Germany, Zimbabwe, Cyprus, Venezuela ... So much good central banking! LMAO!   :D

this is part of the branding problem. People should stop thinking of buying bitcoin. We should think of buying, selling, trading, and generally using Satoshis. Because when Bitcoin reaches very high prices, we won't be sending each other whole bitcoin on a daily basis. Well, ok, ultra wealthy people will, but not us lowly mortals who are not \*illionaires. We'll be dealing in Satoshi day to day. At least, that's what Bitcoin maximalists dream of, right? I mean those who envision the one world currency notion. Please let me know if I am somehow mistaken. Thank you.

No, it has not ended up 9 out of the last 10 years. Please review the charts. It's gone up dramatically, higher and faster than any other asset in history. But to say it ended up 9 out of its first 10 years is ... well ... wrong. 2014, in case you're wondering, ended lower than it began. So that's 8 out of 10 years that it ended up. Though extremely impressive, 80% is just not 90%. Sorry to sound nitpicky.

Bear in mind, some of those fortunes lay sitting around all packaged up, for about a decade, it seems. Best not to eat the actual cookie.

I definitely get your point. I was just being ... precise. Shocking, when it comes to talking about market prices. I know. Still, it happened. :) Happy trading or investing to all :)
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:01:55
You don't say. I thought bitcoin was just a modern euphemism for a walk in the park. Non Investment opportunity, you say? Tell me more, please. I would be happy to read your bitcoin non-investment opportunity pamphlet or brochure, if you have one. How much does it cost not to invest in Bitcoin? :D

Of course there are exceptions to every rule. And there's surely dementia in all dimensions. :) Most people, however, probably can and should manage their own, once it's really easy enough for the typical below average tech user. 
Don't get me wrong. I'm not extremely anti-bank or any kind of ideologue. I think any legit business that delivers a good product or service, is due what it has earned. I just think that most people don't need banks for most things, and they will need them less and less in the future, as they take more control over their assets. Even if they still need a bank account just to be able to hold fiat somewhere or do other things that still require a bank account.

:) Not parading anything. Just interested in learning from what you share about your local experience, as you are also from South America and surely know the landscape much, much better than me. So ... Thanks! :)

Why, don't you trust  banks and other asset custodians to secure your assets? I mean, it's not like they've ever failed anyone before, right? :D
Leaving money on an exchange or keeping in a wallet .. either way, you're still "responsible" for your own assets. if the bank loses your money, or if coinbase loses your bitcoin, what difference does it make? Either way, you were responsible for leaving your currencies in those places. No different than having to responsibly hold your own.   The only real difference is, at least when you hold your own, no "trusted" third party is required for you to do anything with your own money.  
So yeah, keep your money in your own private bank / personal hardware wallets / paper wallets .. or in your memory (if you can remember all those passwords). Unless, of course, you don't trust yourself more than a young child should be trusted with handling power tools without competent adult supervision.

I love Raspberry Pi for all the creative hacks it is able to handle.
This is a brilliant use of the device. Thanks for sharing the guide, Stadicus.

Clearly there aren't many properties whose mortgages are able to be paid off this way, or they'd all already be paid off, or bought out by wealthier people looking to buy properties in Venezuela on the cheap.
@_date: 2019-05-02 15:47:01
Yes, it's low. Yes to all you said. All the same, there are mortgages. :) And thanks for sharing your continental insights. Have you been to Venezuela since Chavez took over? Or since Maduro followed in his position as dictator? Have you had the dubious distinction of witnessing streets littered with useless Bolivars?
@_date: 2019-05-02 11:45:49
You think there is no real estate market, complete with mortgages, in Venezuela? Until Chavez took power, it was the wealthiest country in South America, thanks to its formidable natural reserves. So it should not surprise anyone to know that yes, Venezuela has mortgages, because indeed, housing is normally not very cheap in Venezuela's historically relatively wealthy market. As messed up as the economy is there at the moment, their banks like lending money and collecting it back with interest, just as much as any typical bank around the world.
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:24:59
Wow, yes, i imagine that life in parts of South America these days are much more difficult than most European countries. That said, Europe and other leading economies seem to be on the verge of some tough times in the next couple of years, maybe. i hope not. but you know ... economies don't just go up or down or sideways. It's all of the above. :) 
I totally agree if tech were more affordable for people in places where the standard of living is lower, there'd be much more adoption at faster rates, of crypto and other tech platforms that improve quality of life.

there's all kinds of great articles and resources about this.
checkout [GetABlockchainWallet.com]( and also the Free Paper Wallet site ... you can see a link to it, on that same site, right at the top.  Short of simply memorizing your private keys, paper wallets are considered very safe when properly created, stored and maintained.
Aside from paper wallets, the hardware wallets like Trezor, Ledger, Ecomi, ColdLar and others you may have heard of, are all considered high quality cold storage crypto wallets.
Again, even if you read an article on an independent site like the Get a blockchain wallet site I listed above, be sure that if you visit any of the wallet makers through them, that you actually get your wallet directly from the manufacturer's website. You'll see that on a site like that one, the links all go to the manufacturer's sites. They do not point to a reseller site. They go straight to the source.
Do NOT buy a refurbished or used one, ever! And Do NOT get one from Amazon or ebay or some other place where it would have been more vulnerable to tampering. Be smart about the hardware you select. Can you use it directly or indirectly for the crypto you use? Is it within your budget? Does it have a solid history and large enough customer use base to show that it is actually safe to use?
Anyway, there is so much to know. I hope this helps a little, and if you have more questions, please ask. I love this topic! :)
