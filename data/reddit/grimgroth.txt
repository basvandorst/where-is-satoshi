I think Yahoo did. I remember cause my brother had an account there

He dislikes/doesnt understand Bitcoin so he probably is thinking about something like Ripple

It's not similar to Facebook though, it's sort of a 4chan actually.

You can join the facebook Bitcoin Argentina groups (there are a couple) and ask for buyers with good references, you will find some for sure

If they have a good reputation, I don't think that would be very common. Just in case, ask to get non Evita 100s (there are normal 100 Pesos bills and limited edition Evita ones, which are harder to check for fakeness)

So... does this work?? :)
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:33:48
So... I have a problem (bug) installing it. Do you know where I can contact the dev team?
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:09:35
It worked! thanks!

I'm not sure if it was introduced in this version or in a previous one, since this is the first time I uninstalled the older version before installing the new one.
The error is, when the application tells me to choose a folder in where to store the blockchain and other files, the folder where i'm storing it has a "strange" character (the letter "é"), and won't recognize it, telling me it can't create the folder (it already exists BTW)

In Argentina we have a Facebook group with over 4000 users: 
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:43:50
Well.. who doesn't? :)
@_date: 2014-05-04 23:15:43
Yup! :) thanks a lot!!

If it makes you feel better, I put 25% of my Bitcoins in Neo&amp;Bee

Inside the Core wallet:
1) Click on "help" menu, then "debug window", then the "console" tab
2) Type: walletpassphrase [your wallet password] 600 (do not include the [ ] brackets, just your wallet password)
3) Write: dumpprivkey [address where you have bitcoin] (do not include the [ ] brackets, just your BTC address)
4) You will be shown your private key for this address. Copy it.
Now that you got your private key(s) for the address(es) that contained BTC prior to the fork of August 1st:
2. Create a BCH wallet in coinomi - WITHOUT altering the derivation path in "ADVANCED SETTINGS".
3. Click on .../Sweep Wallet and paste the BTC private key that you obtained in step 1.
Your forked coins should now appear in your Coinomi BCH wallet.
If you had BTC in many addresses, you have to sweep each one of them.
Oh, and one more thing, just to be sure... don't use this Core wallet again after this. Your private keys could now be accessed by someone else. If you want to keep on using Core, erase your Wallet and create a new one.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:52:22
What you did after the fork with your BTC doesn't matter for BCH, they are in the addresses you have in your Core wallet.

In case you re wondering, "arriba" means "up" :)
@_date: 2015-04-25 13:29:54
Soo... Am I in time? :)
@_date: 2011-06-21 20:24:20
True. In many cities in Argentina, a 5830 and similar cards consume about 6 USD a month, running 24/7
@_date: 2011-06-10 12:08:35
I know they can be overclocked some more. But i'm having some trouble with it, I sometimes cant lower the memory so much (today I left them mining with memories at 650), and my temperatures are currently much higher (75-80 deg at almost 60% fan).
My model is the Sapphire 5830 xtreme, I have to try to remove the plastic case that surrounds part of the cards, this way I might be able to reduce the temperature a couple degrees.
@_date: 2011-06-10 03:39:50
I have two 5830, together they do around 500 MH/s
@_date: 2011-09-07 21:47:27
Im at job in a crappy OS that won't allow me to install programs.
Maybe you could do it instead of just giving orders.
@_date: 2011-09-07 21:07:09
Here's the other one:
@_date: 2011-06-08 05:19:07
How hard was it to generate a BTC back then?
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:58:49
Yeah, he does it by himself... not associated with Riot at all. He charges an extra, but it's useful for people with no access to credit cards
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:28:01
I asked him, he says you can PM him and he will answer any questions, in english
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:25:06
No updates... =/
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:56:25
You should just use them and rebuy what you spent... that way you contribute to the Bitcoin's future =)
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:26:58
And it's done :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:54:26
I heard localbitcoins is good, someone from EU will probably give you more alternatives

And if you want to live in a different country, it can be much less than that, here I can do great with 10k/year (paying rent, but not owning a car)
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:28:34
Well, you can just tell them you cashed out... it doesn't mean you cashed out ALL of your btc, just some... but you don't have to give out so many details =)
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:37:09
Probably we will see it by 2013
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:30:06
How can I hide what I got? A few people know my address and can check out what I got, but if I move that to another address they can just see where it went and suspect it is still mine. Is there a way to hide it completely?
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:41:25
Looks promising but it doesn't seem to work =/ maybe it's a new feature and not yet working?
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:57:29
The app I have (QR droid) couldn't decode it =/ thanks
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:24:37
ROBABANK... good name lol
