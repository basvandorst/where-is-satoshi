A masternode is comparable to Bitcoin's full nodes.
A full node in Bitcoin is simply a computer that hosts a copy of the blockchain and is therefore a node in the network.
Bitcoin's full nodes are free to run, but also offer no rewards. This lets Bitcoin's node count grow indefinitely.
With other coins, masternodes require you to acquire a certain amount of coins, which are then locked into your masternode.
These masternodes are simply nodes on the network that help process payments.
The fact that these coins are locked in your masternode, makes the coin more scarce, which increases its price.
Masternodes cost money, and also yield it. You'll get rewards in return for your efforts of acquiring coins, and locking the coins into a masternode, for which you'll have to buy vps hosting.
The upside to masternodes is that early adopters can make nice bank on them. I've done well with alqo and smartcash myself.
The downside to masternodes is that they quickly become more expensive, which hampers the decentralization of the coin.
Most masternode coins I've seen have no unique selling point with regards to Bitcoin. In my mind, they will all fail.
They're a bit of a scam, really. But the people *want* this altcoin casino, and so they shall have it.

Can someone explain to me...
How do recently mined &gt;2MB blocks mean that SegWit is working well?
SegWit adoption is still lingering around 10%, just like it has for months.
Why are miners now mining &gt;2MB blocks all of a sudden?
Does the new hashing power come from new miners, who have Bitcoin's best interests in mind?
Are they trying to help Bitcoin by making its transactions go faster by increasing txs per block + block time?

@_date: 2019-07-01 18:18:55
Agreed. If anything, history shows the opposite.
When Bitcoin rises from its lows, there's a lot of disbelief and people that want to break even. A lot of market exiters are willing to sell off to get out asap.
The closer we get to the ATH, the fewer underwater sellers we will have. Beyond it, there's free price exploration for all. Newbies come in. They'll want more Bitcoin. They see alts...
We're already starting to see the decoupling of alts from Bitcoin's movements.

You cannot design mass adoption into a coin anymore than you can design a movie to become the world's biggest blockbuster.
You can design it to have 20 super heroes, played by all the best actors. You can design it to get a soundtrack from the world's most revered sound track composer. You can design it to get a story from all the world's best writers. But you cannot design its ultimate success.
Adoption is not a design property.

They have an [extremely clear path]( to rejuvation therapy. They've known precisely what needs to be fixed for many, many years.
80 Million would not cure aging. But currently SENS rolls on a 4 million a year budget. A single million only pays for 3 months of research.

True, but is the cost for exploiting this bug really the cost of a single block's rewards?
A miner can't spend his rewards until they're at least 100 blocks old.
Exploiting the bug successfully would significantly lower Bitcoin's value. So there goes 100 blocks worth of rewards.
Seems to me the true cost of exploiting this bug would be 100 \* 12.5 = 1250 BTC.

Dear PineappleFund,
If you support [SENS]( then you will also support [LEAF Science](
Talk to Steve Hill about it. His Facebook is: 
His Reddit user is I support both SENS as well as LEAF Science. I'm not here to convince you of how to split your Bitcoin between them.
I just want to emphasize the following:
Depending on the size of your contribution, you might very well help bring the cure for aging a couple of days/weeks/months/years closer.
For every single day that your donation brings it closer, you will save 100,000 human lives.
Because that's how many people die from aging every day.
Aging is the world's most important problem, because it creates the greatest amount of grief.
There is no more efficient way of donating your Bitcoins in terms of decreasing world suck, than to donate it to life extension research.
You are in the unique position of:
- holding lots of Bitcoins
- supporting life extension
- willing to donate to life extension research
Make no mistake. No other person on this planet is currently wielding as much power as you are.
There has never been a greater technophilanthropic anywhere on this planet, in the entire history of mankind.
Donate to life extension research and you shall become the unsung hero of the 21st century.

Thanks. This is insanely helpful.
Some more questions:
1. If security is so important in BitCoin, then why would BitPay use proprietary encryption that's no more than childproofing?
2. I was planning on using encryption to keep thieves out of my wallet. Are you saying the only way of keeping a wallet safe is to delete it from your disk (something the client doesn't even let me do) ?
3. How do you access your own private keys? Are they in the wallet? Can you extract them from the wallet with a program?
4. How will I know which clients are BIP-39 compatible (a Google search for this does not yield a clear result for this) ?
@_date: 2017-02-04 22:55:16
Thanks for some useful info so far. Now I have more questions!
1. What's a paper wallet?
2. What counts as a 'seed stored safely'?
3. How does 'seed' relate to 'wallet'?
4. Can the 12 word phrase also recover my wallet if I managed to encrypt it and then lost access to it?
5. If yes, does this then mean that wallet encryption only applies to files on my local disk, rather than my wallet on the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-02-07 11:55:50
I have found out how security works with the BitPay Win10 client. I'm just coming back to this thread to share with others what I have learned.
BitPay does, in fact, have features for backing up your wallet and setting a spending password. It's just hidden so subtly, that I couldn't find it.
It's under settings -&gt; personal wallet. Derp.
The reason I never clicked 'personal wallet' is because I thought it would take me back to my, you know, personal wallet. But it actually takes you to backup &amp; password for your personal wallet.
To make a 'backup' actually does nothing else than show you your 12 word phrase again so you can reverify it.
So you absolutely have to set a spending password. Any thief could now not only spend all my btc, but also simply see my 12 word phrase, giving him access to my wallet in the future on any device.
Setting a password makes the 'backup' inaccessible without providing the password.
Support confirmed to me, as stated above, that you can indeed always access your wallet by providing the 12 word phrase on any other device.

Not unless you fear an attack from a quantum computer.
Your pubkey is revealed every time you perform a transaction. It's a **public** key. You have nothing to fear. It's supposed to be public.
Bitcoin addresses are derived from public keys. Public keys are derived from private keys. This is a one way (trap door) function. You can't practically calculate it in the other direction. Bitcoin's security hinges pretty much entirely on this fact.

@_date: 2017-08-24 17:27:38
Big blocks are a shit way of scaling up, since they only increase transactions/second by a little bit. You need really big blocks to compete with visa/mastercard.
On the other hand, big blocks lead to a centralized coin, because it becomes harder to host a full node.
The reason why miners don't want SegWit is because of AsicBoost, a mining advantage that SegWit destroys. BHC is a SegWit-less shitcoin they created for themselves.
The 2x HF will not make BCH obsolete. The same people who support BCH also support the 2x HF. They're all in the same camp of big blockholes.
BTC's fees were also low when hardly anybody used it and the mempool wasn't being logjammed with spam transactions. BTC works just fine under normal circumstances. No blocksize increase is ever going to prevent somebody from logjamming the mempool.

SegWit2x is a SegWit activation mechanism, much like BIP148 was.
We've got SegWit and that's all we need. Nobody wants a shitty 2x fork, which is actually 8MB.
The big blocker crowd is purposely using confusing naming conventions to further their corporate agenda.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:50:19
I thought it was through BIP91, as it [says here](
It also says there that it should make BIP148 irrelevant. And I thought it was.

With the 2x hard fork, the maximum blocksize is 8MB.
SegWit, which we have now, already has 2MB blocks as a compromise.
Learned it from Core dev @_date: 2017-08-31 11:49:24
Thanks, that helps.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:39:06
If you want to think that BCH/2x supporters (they're the same bunch) would want to weaken BCH for themselves, fine. I say miners are already [switching back and fro]( to the most profitable coin at this very moment.
Just because SegWit took ages, it doesn't mean that that's what the future will look like. SegWit opens the door for a myriad of updates, all of which can be rolled out as fast as devs can manage it.
I sincerely doubt that, in the future, devs will set a 95% hashrate for the activation of an update, ever again. Devs learn.
And with the attention that Bitcoin is gonna get this year, its support will make it nearly invincible. People will want what's best for it. The best idea will win. All the forked shitcoins in the world won't stand a chance. Users learn.

I did not present logic, only an observation and a question.
BCash copied both the software as well as the blockchain history. Every cryptocoin that isn't Bitcoin is an altcoin. That's the definition of altcoin.
So what if it's an altcoin?
What happens when miners decide to mine BCash because it's more profitable and it stays that way?
What will core do to fight this?
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:30:07

I was recently in an online skirmish with this fool and he offered to send me some btc/bch, for no reason at all.
I accepted the offer and he proceeded to send me a tiny little bit of btc. At first I wasn't sure why. Then it dawned on me... he wanted me to see it came from a wallet that has seen &gt;1400 btc move through it over the years.
I still think he's rekt though. Nothing will make you more salty than having had a lot of btc and having lost it before it became valuable.

If you'll [click around]( on the wallets offered by bitcoin.org, you'll see that Electrum is the only one who gets 'all green' in the listed specs.
They dropped Co/Bit(Main)Pay. So will I and so should you.
Electrum can import BitPay wallets. Just click 'advanced' and check 'BIP39'. Electrum will then give you access to the exact same wallet as BitPay used to.

Are some of those sha256d altcoins more profitable to mine than Bitcoin?
If so, why hasn't the Bitcoin chain died already?
Is there any good reason that will prevent miners from making the BTC/BCH mining switch?
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:22:33
Bitcoin miners have hardware dedicated to Bitcoin mining, don't they?
They can't easily switch to non-Bcash altcoin mining, but they can easily switch to BCash mining, can't they?
So how is BCash 'just an altcoin', when it differs from all the other altcoins when it comes to ease-of-miner-switching?

You are vehemently of the opinion that Bitcoin == BTC. Is that because BTC is what we've had for nearly a decade?
Who determines what 'the' Bitcoin protocol is? What happens if the BCH altcoin overtakes BTC and the majority thinks BCH is Bitcoin?
Why do you say BCH was not a hardfork? They forked the existing BTC transaction chain, did they not?
How can it pump so high if only a fraction of the community is behind it? There's a whole subreddit (rBTC) behind it. Are you sure its support is small?

@_date: 2019-02-25 11:26:18
Then maybe you can explain me in more detail how it works.
It says in this post that with splicing you will open and close a channel with every transaction. However, as I have understood it for many months now, opening and closing of channels are txs on the blockchain. So it sounds like the number of txs per bitcoin-spend are going to double, which defeats the whole purpose of LN.
Obviously, I am not getting something here. What am I missing?
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:43:48
It is and it isn't.
If you were Bitcoin-wealthy, wouldn't you be willing to mine at a loss in order to maintain the value of your coin?
Entire economies are going to be built on top of Bitcoin. I think the future can spare some hash computation.

Luke, when miners shift 80% to 2x and keep it there, what will be the consequences?
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:13:57
Not limiting it means miners would be able to mine blocks as huge as they want.
Like the video explains, sending 10GB blocks across the network is undoable.
Infrastructure isn't growing as fast as Bitcoin. Therefore, big blocks are a bad way of scaling.
On-chain doesn't scale. So why bother? Off-chain scaling is already in the pipeline.

He's probably afraid that Bitcoin will slow down so much that the masses will start to think it sucks and then flee to bcash/2x.
So Luke, why isn't hashrate leaving a problem according to you?
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:46:07
Literally both are true.
The blockchain was designed to grow linearly and [it does]( It had to, because anything more than that is unacceptable, since it leads to centralization.
(Without a linear cap on the blocksize and therefore growth rate, Bitcoin would've already failed and btrash would have never forked off.)
Bandwidth grows exponentially, [as you can see here](
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:10:41
Luke is out of touch with a large portion of reality. It does not matter, since Bitcoin is highly decentralized.
If his ideas find no traction with the rest of the community, then it isn't happening. He can push all he wants, but he will have to learn to be alone with his own thoughts from time to time. It's part of growing up.

It's roger ver conning koreans into thinking bcash is bitcoin. The bitcoin dump (profit taking) is unrelated. It just makes it seem like it is. But like always, the community takes notice.
Anything that goes up that fast, must come down. And besides, it's BTC that's going to wall street, not BCH.
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:55:53
The first bit of the curve might make it seem like an exponential curve, but the full blocks of recent times are most definitely not surpassing O(N), or linear growth.
How could it? A block comes every 10 minutes and has a maximum size. The blocks used to be 1MB, which made the blockchain size function y = 1x. Now the blocks are 2MB, which makes it y = 2x.
Both are linear functions. Your math teacher will confirm.

I've seen talk about this before. He seems to suspect that bandwidth isn't growing fast enough to be able to keep up with the blockchain size. The situation doesn't seem so bad to me. I wonder what the rationale behind it is?
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:49:57
The current 2MB block size is what it is. No sense in worrying why that's so.
When we talk about 'scaling', we implicitly means 'scaling indefinitely'.
If something doesn't scale indefinitely, it doesn't scale.
With the current blocksize, Bitcoin works fine when the network isn't being overrun with spam transactions. The problem is that no blocksize is big enough to prevent somebody from logjamming the mempool with spam.
Not only do big blocks not scale... they are not in any way, shape or form a solution to any problem.
Regardless of your personal ideals, the reality is that sometimes you need to be realistic. And the reality is that Lightning Network is coming. At this point, discussing big blocks is a pointless waste of time.
If you want big blocks so bad, why not move to bcash?
If bcash isn't good enough, then go to github and fork the Bitcoin Core project, give it bigger blocks, call it "Bitcoin Big Blocks", and go shill it at a location where people are always looking for the next shitfork of the month: r/btc.
Make sure not to refer to it as "Bitcoin BB", because that would be respectless.

The blocks are already 2MB. These came with SegWit.
The reason why you don't want to double that, even once, is because then you double the storage space and the bandwidth requirements.
It leads to centralization. And you get a very small increase in tx/sec. It is not worth it.
Off-chain scaling will increase tx/sec by much more.
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:22:08
Yes they will. It's just that always blindly optimizing for decentralization isn't the be all end all.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:51:22

Whoa there, Nelly.
The NYA fall-off isn't complete yet. And as you can see from his tweet, ViaBTC signals it but won't mine it. There's others like that, too.
Some of these guys never realized what they signed up to. They are starting to learn this is no upgrade, but just a chain split.
Then there's the fact that miners don't have the intellect of a shrimp and the memory span of a gold fish.
They're not going to swing back and forth between coins wildly all the time. They know that if Bitcoin's hashrate is low and the difficulty will adjust, someone's gonna step in on their action.
Hashrates are growing as you can see on fork.lol.

Clever girl.
Let us know how it went.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:52:04
Those 0.129263 are my change address. From a google search I understand this is how I get paid back from myself after spending 0.0001 from a single receive address?
Is BitPay going to report this 0.129263 coming back to me or what? Why does BitPay think the 0.129363 is outgoing when in fact the 0.0001 is outgoing?
BitPay also says this transaction was created 15 minutes ago, even though I created it well over an hour ago?
I think I figured it out.
BitPay isn't seeing the change address that was created by Electrum, therefore it assumes it's an address that doesn't belong to me, so it shows the whole transaction output's coins as outgoing.
[Here's a screenshot with a side by side comparison.](
Funny thing is... I've deleted BitPay's files in my user dir. Then I restarted it. It did not see any wallets (because I deleted the files, duh). Then I imported my wallet from scratch.
And it *still* doesn't show my balance correctly?
How can BitPay not be up to date on my recently added change address? The transaction is fucking done and [confirmed]( It's 0.0001 to my Bittrex and 0.129163 back to my own change address.
As long as BitPay shows me an incorrect balance, it's fucking useless to me.
What a fucking piece of shit.

I have indeed imported my seeds into Electrum.
How is this dangerous? Then why does Electrum even offer the support to do so?
Anyhoo, it's a [known issue](
I don't understand the technicalities of it yet. But the issue is simply that BitPay doesn't know the change address is mine.
In my mind it shouldn't matter which wallet I use to access my funds using my 12 word phrase. But the reality is that it somehow does matter.
I'm asking myself why, because isn't all BTC/wallet related info supposed to be on the blockchain?
This situation implies that I could lose my software wallet due to a HD crash or computer theft, but I still have my 12 word phrase to restore my wallet... so I go ahead and do that, in another software wallet this time, and... too few funds!
What if I haven't checked my funds in a while and I don't even notice funds missing? I could lose BTC and not even realize it.
This is an opportune learning moment for me.
Can somebody explain why BitPay isn't seeing the change address made by Electrum?

Some people will prefer this, since it won't make their cpu/bandwidth/hd unusable for, say, 3 days.
Instead, their resources will be 50% usable over, say, 6 days.
The only way to find out if this feature truly is desired, like I suspect it is, is by asking around.
You do lots of polls, don't you?

I learned from it. And by the looks of it, Electrum will let me send the full amount to another address.
I'm transferring my coins to a new wallet later today. I'll manage it from a single software wallet, while I await the arrival of my ledger nano s.
I still don't understand how a recovery-from-scratch of this wallet in BitPay won't see the change address, but apparently it would if I did the same thing in Electrum.
Oh well, maybe I'll find out one day.
It's probably because of the wallet derivation that is used. I don't know what to do with that, so I just leave it as Electrum offers it upon wallet recovery.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:24:20
Coinbase, like miners, will follow the money.
They won't create confusion that will cost them profits.
If the Bitcoin 2X stays at a much lower price, then obviously they're not going to call it Bitcoin.
Why not?
Because then people would be buying a cheaper coin. They'd rather have them buying expensive coins.
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:01:45
There is no BitPay transaction. I created 1 transaction to Bittrex in Electrum, from the same wallet that I have open in BitPay.
It's been 12 hours and BitPay is still showing the wrong balance. It's like it's unable to pick up on the change address that Electrum created.
What could possibly cause that?
It's disturbing and I'll likely transfer the whole balance to a new wallet to fix this.
BitPay is officially useless to me. Showing a wrong outgoing transaction and a wrong balance is unacceptable.

When you say CPU time, you mean the CPU gets hogged a lot?
If the bandwidth is such a problem, then why not provide an option that lets people tone down the bandwidth usage, so they won't have to fear the Core software hogs their entire bandwidth?

1. So bigger blocks don't centralize bitcoin?

The ledger *with* the nano s?
You mean the ledger nano s? It's one wallet.
Also, are you saying I can access an electrum wallet from my ledger nano s by switching from one to another?
Doesn't make sense to me. As I understand it, a hardware wallet contains its own deterministically calculated coin wallets.
I'll have to move the coins from my software wallets into the hardware wallets by transfer, no?
The whole point of a hardware wallet is that the private key (24 word phrase in the case of ledger nano s) is never used on my online desktop.
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:46:37


Nope, that's only **within** the BTC protocol.
Miners are in a race with each other to find the next block and, should they find blocks at the same time, build the longest chain.
Longest chain wins. Miner who built it gets the rewards.
Altcoin chains have nothing to do with the BTC chain.

Bitcoin's the only one with underlying technology that's been evolving for 9+ years.
At some point, other coins will reach scale. And when they do, they will have to actually scale.
If you think coins can scale on the blockchain, then... you're the dinosaur.

He thinks Bitcoin won't be the biggest.
I wonder how he reconciles this with his earlier statement that Bitcoin is the Internet of money.
You'd think the Internet of money would be the biggest, despite institutions creating their own bubble boy coins and driving up the market cap.
Otoh, if true, then this implies there will always be multiple cryptocurrencies to trade. ;)

It says "2x" right in the subver.
This is also how the linked script bans nodes. So why don't 2x'ers just change the subver to not include "2x"?

Let's say Coinbase makes the 2x shitfork 'BTC' and the newbies don't notice the coin's price is 1/10th of what they heard it was, and they accidentally buy it.
The newbies will be educated in due time. They'll get angry. There'll be a backlash.
You say they have no idea what they're doing. Well, then you're admitting the possibility Coinbase is being naive, rather than malicious.
It's all just nature taking its course.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:22:06
They don't have percentage based fees or anything?
(I wouldn't know, because I don't use them.)
I dunno man, but I'd wanna be in a booming market if I were them.
Leading sheep to the slaughter seems like a good way to fuck up the market.
This, like any other FUD, is going to turn out to be a dud.

He literally says that he thinks Bitcoin won't be the biggest. :P
He is a self proclaimed pacifist. Says so in his twitter bio. I once explained this to a fellow twitterer and Andreas gave me a like for it. So that's how I know I'm totally right about him. I have his twitter blessing, after all.
His pacifism prevents him from being a Bitcoin maximilist (he literally stated that he is not previously) and having the attitude of hating on shitcoins.

Even if it had gained majority support, it still would not have been Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:33:24
What the question is, depends on the risk you're trying to assess. Ideally, it would not be possible. Practically, not having a motive for a 51% would also be quite a comfort.
The equipment would still be a loss, since it would've gone on to make a profit if they hadn't destroyed crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:41:45
That's true.
I was also wondering if it would be in a big miner's interest to 51% attack the coin that makes him loads of money.
Destroy Bitcoin and it will bleed all the cryptomarkets. They couldn't switch to mining altcoins and all their equipment would be a huge loss.
But then again, there has already been an attempt to destroy Bitcoin in favor of Bcash.
Something tells me this isn't a real threat, because market mechanisms always end up stabilizing a situation.
But if you're invested, you've gotta take every fud/concern seriously.
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:35:16
The bcash fork required the bad guys to voluntarily modify the code base.
Seems to be a 51% attack on Bitcoin would be targeted at... Bitcoin.

You state it has multiple problems, but mention only the one problem that we're already aware of, and a new PoW wouldn't solve: namely that one party could get 51% of the hash rate for the new PoW again.
What are these other problems you want to solve with a new PoW?
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:16:12
It is not infinitely divisible.
The smallest amount of bitcoin is 1 Satoshi.
1 Satoshi is one hundred millionth of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:43:49


You recently told me on Twitter that changing PoW would teach miners not to attempt a 51% attack.
What I didn't know yet is that you consider the current PoW algo broken. What is so bad about it and how would you like to fix it?

Andreas is saying, in 2015, that no single state can mount a 51% attack.
This article is suggesting big miners work start working together and end up having 51% as a group.
Andreas says that these 51% bastards would have 'dominance over the next block for 10 minutes' and then could be 'kicked off the network'.
But how would the community actually achieve said kicking-off?

You seem knowledgeable, so let me ask you a question!
I'm currently storing my bitcoin in a BitPay local software wallet. BitPay does not support BIP148.
Let's say there is a chainsplit, where the BIP148 chain splits from the legacy chain.
Have I now lost my bitcoin on the BIP148 chain, since BitPay won't support it?
Can I restore my BitPay wallet using my 12 word phrase in another client, that does support BIP148?
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:43:18
Hardware wallets, like local software wallets, give you an xx-word restore phrase.
What's the diff in security between hardware and local software wallets then?
Seems to me the security is in how secure you manage to store your phrases.
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:03:37
The safety of your coins seems to be in storing your word phrase.
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:31:23
There [aren't that many]( BIP148 wallets by the looks of it.
Regarding the dedicated laptop... this is the advice I got from Luke-Jr in private messaging.
Which local wallet are you using then?

I'm getting nowhere fast.
Nobody has an answer to the question what's the safest local software wallet.
Also, I'm not storing 12 word phrases on paper. Not from a software wallet and not from a hardware wallet. What if the house catches fire? Poof!
I'd rather store them electronically and redundantly, encrypted with a safe master password I use everyday and can't possibly ever forget.
Unless at one point I'll have a brain hemorrhage, ofcourse.
So it's a tough choice, really...
I'm I gonna bet that my house will never get fire, or that my brain will never hemorrhage?
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:00:17
Seems to me hardware wallets are easier for a bad actor to accidentally have them fall into their pocket while you're not looking.
What if he guesses your PIN and you've neglected to set a spending password?
Hardware wallets keep the private keys on their own hardware (if I'm not mistaken). So the private keys would still be on a machine.

Miner support for SegWit2x is currently around 90%.
