Can you elaborate on the other inaccuracies you have mentioned?
My apologies if I had omitted or twisted any relevant facts when trying to make this readable for the general audience, I did my best to avoid that.

Magnum's better :)

3. My bad, you're right. Even though Roger Ver announced his support of the fork a week before the split, he was not involved in the idea from the very start. Thank you for clarifying!
4. This is truly surprising, can you please specify what fixes you are referring to and when they are scheduled to be released? Some news floated around a while ago, but it looks as though nothing has been done yet (or is being planned to).

Why do you "basically know" that? Why can't a bit of our texting culture be shown on the internet and maybe slip into English? 
It's fun and it doesn't bother anyone. Besides, people do it regardless of whether they're from a small town or Central Moscow, rich or poor, etc. 
As to the story -- absolutely no idea, it goes all the way back to the early 2000s, I think. When I started using ICQ in late 2000s, it'd become mainstream by then

I'm the one who wrote the article, and I'm very sorry if I messed up when trying to get my point across. However, the 2 points given above do not contradict what I have written:
1. Of course other malleability fixes could have been implemented, but it's questionable whether a different approach would have been agreed upon, seeing as no other solution gained much traction. So it is the one fix that is **needed**.
2. If you read carefully, it is stated that SegWit **allows** LN to be implemented, not that SegWit is required per se. Again, coming back to the same argument.
My goal here was not only to promote the wallet, but also to spread awareness and increase adoption, which is currently a major problem facing Bitcoin. After all, it's been ages since it all started, and many are still reluctant to switch.

Thank you for clearing that up. I have read about Malfix before, but thought the idea was abandoned completely at this point.  
Nice to know at least something is going on. It's about time the big players started thinking ahead and bringing real improvements to the users.

Hi there, I'm the author of the article.At this point, it's very much a gamble. Even though the costs of running a node are not that high yet, you won't know just how much you can earn until the network goes fully mainstream.  
You can charge a base fee and a liquidity fee that would depend on the amount of traffic that goes through the node, but the number of users would depend on both the rates themselves and the node's utility.  
So, it may be a worthwhile investment, but like with many things in crypto, there's a lot of guesswork involved.

I agree, should have specified some of the safer cold storage options. But my research is focused on the more prevalent online wallets and exchanges, cold wallets will probably be up next
