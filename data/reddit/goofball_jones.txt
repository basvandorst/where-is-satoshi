This coming from the guy Paul Ryan said "...I'm telling you, he didn't know *anything* about government ... I wanted to scold him all the time." 
But I'm sure he has a firm grasp of cryptocurrency. /s

seems like everything is. I no longer know what's real and what isn't.

Just let it play itself out. There's no reasoning with them. There's blood in the water and there's a frenzy and like aways, it's a bunch of rabid weasels fucking in a burlap bag. 
Also, trying to point out it was actresses with easily guessed passwords(not putting the blame on them btw, it has more to do with education of how to properly do passwords, something not everyone automagically knows) along social engineering and not that Apple was 'hacked' is like beating your head against a wall. Apple certainly didn't help matters with no rate-limiting on password guesses (only patched last Monday), nor do they encrypt phone data backed up via iCloud (something they have to fix). There were failings, yes. But no true "hacks". 
I honestly wished it were a "hack", as it would be something they could easily patch. But with this type of thing, they have to go with the much harder endeavor of teaching their users to use 2factor, using non-guessable passwords and things like that AND changing the way they do things internally. 
In terms of using this for payments, actually read up on how they do it and how will keep your payments safe and secure...much more secure than giving a waiter your credit card and they walk off with it. Also, **this has to be drilled into people's heads: even if by some miracle Applepay is hacked and you get money stolen, you're not culpable for it. You will get refunded just as if you get false charges on your card now**. In the case of nude photos, it's not like they can take back a leak.
