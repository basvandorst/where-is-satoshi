With Bitcoin its nobody knows it ll survive tomorrow or next year.
Since the existence of mankind thousands millions of currencies created..Which one survived until now.
The thing im trying to say is Bitcoin is more dangerous than any other crisis happened in states.Just look at the numbers last year it was 1150$,6 months ago 600$ and now 350$.
