because with bitpay you are probably paying full price at the merchants that use bitpay and at Purse you get the discount.

amazon.co.uk is available for the marketplace on Purse. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 00:32:37
yeah try Purse.io. Might have to pay a little more but super easy and fast and you can use your credit card
@_date: 2015-03-27 21:03:19
i use Purse.io and its way better. Instant order for 8% or lower not bad.
@_date: 2015-03-27 19:48:47
just use Purse.io for 5% off Amazon.

I have a had a lot of transactions on Purse and they have all gone very well! I would recommend this site for any bitcoiner because its the perfect P2P market place.

why Im getting 100% of my salary in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:42:24
yeah, that seems to be a very possible way of getting BTC. If you try it I would love to know if it worked. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:32:18
Viva La Bitcoin!

 - Raspberry PI for Bitcoin at 20% off.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:54:53
bought my MacBook Pro on their and went really great and I got 25% off with no issues. I think the 50% is a bit ambitious because it depends on the buyer market and what they want to spend on Bitcoin. I got an email from them that said to ensure that I get my order accepted I should lower my discount to around 20%.

Good day for bitcoin
