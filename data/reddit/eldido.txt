actually, the sorting algorithm is really good. But it's true that a good early comment will have much more exposure, due to being there longer, and being good :)  
If you sort by date though you will see that a lot of poor old comments are at the bottom when sorted by "best"

@_date: 2015-06-13 22:01:17
Basically he used their android app and it asks for the rights to access all accounts on the phone on the lastest update. He repeatedely asked for clarifications (including calling his conselor apparently) saying he would take it to the next step and mass mail them if they didn't answer to his questions.  
Next day, his account is closed, cc revoked and funds locked.  
He is in the process of getting legal advices.

You have to understand that you don't know in advance if the next block will be full or not. Usually your best indicator is if the last block was full and if there are a lot of unconfirmed transactions (these days there are often around 7k) but it's not very accurate. Some miners don't mine full block even though they could for some reasons.  
As a result I had a lot of legitimate transactions, with standard fees, that were dropped by the network. Some where standard, other were colored coins (XCP / Omni / Coinprism). It's really a mess to deal with and cost me a lot of time I could use doing usefull things.  
Anyway this is just me talking about my experience and apparently I'm not alone in this case. I'm just saying the network was in much better shape a few months ago and everybody agrees that something must be done about it.   
Not all blocks are full, it would be much worse if they were, but you can't just point to one specific block and think that everything's allright because it's not full. And it's not bad to acknowledge that something's wrong, it's always the first step to make it better.
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:02:23

Do you run a bitcoin business ? You probably don't because if you did you'd know bitcoin is not working this fine these days. Full blocks are a real pain for anyone who wants to send transactions to a lot of people or who wants to use colored coins and such.

@_date: 2014-09-27 14:58:23
I still dont believe this will take off. It's been tried through history lots of times (with chess and a lot of other games) and never worked. Nobody wants to risk money against an opponent who he knows is stronger in a skill based game without a good part of randomness. And in all competitive games, you know where you stand regarding skill against a specific opponent. Best of luck anyway. I would be very interested in usage stats.
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:43:38
So if I get this right: on a trade, the "initiator" earns 0.25% of the transaction and the one that placed the order first pays 0.75% ? Sounds strange to me.  
Won't it discourage people to place orders that aren't executed immediately and will therefor lower the liquidity ?
  
edit: apparently I read it backward. It does encourage a very tight spread. Guess it's a waiting game then :)

We have a lot of time before block rewards get really low : it s going to be 3 btc in around 8 years so a price increase would largely solve the issue. This is a premature introduction of fee market, if thats ever a good solution, at best. If the uses continue to grow linearly, the number of transactions would bring more fees...  
   


  
Because offer is artificially limited by the blocksize now that transactions often take most of the available space.  
   
  


  
  
Sure but why limit the use cases now before we have really explored a lot more ? If we are driving users to offchain solutions, they will go for what s easier to use and we are not sure it will be lightning at this point. It could be altcoins, it could be services like coinbase or xapo ... what s the point of having this great decentralized, censorship resistant, trustless ledger if you are forced to use third parties that are centralized, can enforce censorship or defraud you ?    
  
  


  
  
Usually upload speeds are 1/8 of the download speed for domestic connctions but this tends to get better with fiber technology. The point is if you are running a full node on a 1mb/sec upload connection you are contributing to the network and unless you are mining blocks yourself, it s fine. Miners are professionnals and they should have no issue having professionnal connections way over what's needed for them.
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:23:32
Illegal banking is possible because they dealt with euros
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:36:26
Isn't it a bit of a word trick since the block limit still exists and is still 1MB ?  
Plus it's not really on-chain scalling if it's still a hard limit that we will hit sometime regardless but I understand it's a pre requisite to off-chain scalling using 2nd layer solutions.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:19:51
How can it be a soft fork if blocks are bigger than 1MB then ?
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:04:26
hum I guess in this scenario exchanges would update their software to accept 2MB blocks or else they are on the minority chain and thus not bitcoin anymore
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:31:21
It's sad how many vocal people in charge of Bitcoin development are not long time supporters. They have their own vision that they are forcing on the community as a whole, instead of working to gain community support. Sadly for all of us, Bitcoin could be hurt very badly by this pivot.  
Seing how Gavin is regularly insulted in this sub is also another proof that Bitcoin is living troubled times.
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:33:19
But that use case sucks.  
Is crypto currency the problem with exchanges liquidity ? Obviously not.
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:34:38

@_date: 2017-02-23 08:40:27
There still is a block weight limit that is very close to the total usage of the network these days. Don't you believe twice the current usage could be achieved very fast ? Also if the block size limit is not in the code but is still enforced because of older node versions, can we really say it's been removed ? 
  
of course you'll always reach some sort of limit, but if we have to go through all this mess just to have 10 times more transactions or less I wouldn't call it a scaling solution, that's my point
@_date: 2016-03-10 12:17:15
I've been running a node for 18 months on this server and never had an issue before, this is sad.
@_date: 2016-03-08 14:28:55
I agree Bitcoin's not broken either as a technology but refusing to raise the block size limit by fear of centralization is just ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:59:33
It doesn't remove the 1MB limit, it changes the way transactions are included in the blocks. Blocks themselves are still limited to 1MB, aren't they?
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:42:36
how about volume data? this is a very strong indicator of the number of people trusting the exchange and more volume usually means less spread so better prices ...

It would have failed to interest many individuals at the very early stages and so it would have failed to interest the financial industry.  
What some people seem to forget is that Bitcoin is where it is today thanks to developpers AND users.  
It's cool that core devs have a lot of great optimisations planned for the future but doing it at the expense of user experience is more dangerous than what they warn us about.

@_date: 2016-01-18 11:04:56
That's your own vision, mine is that most businesses and users need and want something core devs have refused to make because of technical debates, turning the issue into a political one. If another dev group is willing to provide the functionnalities users have been waiting for, it's only natural that they'll turn to this new implementation. In the end, it only proves that devs can't lose touch of what users want for long before they are replaced, and that's a great thing.

Funny you phrase it like that, knowing we burn millions of dollars of electricity each day to secure the network. The motivation is simple : most people here believe it's better for bitcoin.  


Most people agree on this being untrue  


The hostility here is in not listening to the userbase   


I've been holding bitcoins for quite a few years now, why would I want to move away from it ?
@_date: 2016-03-08 13:25:11
good point
@_date: 2016-03-08 14:25:56


It doesn't matter to you now, but would you have been sold on Bitcoin if you were told fees could increase 10 fold when the system will be successfull. It doesn't sound like a great scalling system.  
Fees are artificially increased and this is not a good thing for adoption. Decentralization only happens because there are some use cases beyond store of value.  


Once again, depends on your usage. It's secure ENOUGH for lots of use cases. You do 0 conf at sellers risks. If they are willing to take the risk, where is the problem ?  
Removing entirely use cases because they don't fit your understanding of what Bitcoin should be is a huge mistake.  


Personnaly I get 100Mo optic fiber for 30€ / m in France but let's have a look at the situation world wide cause I know I'm in a great situation here :   
Oups, It looks like a lot of third world countries could easily handle 2Mo blocks even with Luke's over the top metrics...
@_date: 2016-03-08 13:48:33


Are you ? I think he gave us a pretty good hint about what bitcoin is about by calling his founding white paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". Maybe you have heard of it ?  


Says who ? Why not let it continue to grow like it has always grown so far ? I'm already quite wealthy thank you for your concern. I've been riding this train since 2011. I am very patient but I'm concerned by the direction taken by core and I'm not afraid of speaking my mind.  


I've bought a LOT of things with bitcoin over the last years and have almost never waited for a confirmation time, thanks to smart payment providers and 0 conf transcations. I've been able to enjoy worldwide instantanous free payments and I'd hate that to stop. Sure it makes less sens for going to starbuck but apparently this and micro transactions are the only use you see in Bitcoin payments.  


Someone has to, but not everybody. YOU DONT NEED A FULL NODE TO USE BITCOIN. Ever heard of SPV wallets ?  
If I need to accept 1M$ payments, I will run a full node with professionnal standards, if I need 200€ on my phone, I will use a SPV wallet and take the risk. There are degrees in this ... 
@_date: 2016-03-08 13:31:04
Agreed but you just acknowledged there are (at least) two plausible answers to the same questions. It's true Occam's razor is not always the right answer but usually it's something to consider. Oleg on the other hand doesn't give this choice in his phrasing.  
I'm citing the blog post here : " I don’t see another explanation [...] than either outright stupidity or participation in a mild short term conspiracy aimed at supressing the price until the next mining reward drop."    
That sounds very wrong in my hear.
@_date: 2016-03-22 08:42:34
IIRC it says 90% of nodes would handle 4MB fine and 50% would handle 32MB today  
So it depends where you set the threshold

@_date: 2016-03-12 20:02:19
There has always been a lot of naysayers on every bitcoin medium, in the press ... It never did that much of a difference. The fact that the supporters are so divided is new though.
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:57:01
Spam attack is easier with smaller blocks since there is so little room left after "legitimate" transactions. Asserting the fee market is the "best way" is very presomptious. Have you though about every other way of doing it ? While this surely will help reduce "spam", it also increase fees for every legitimate uses and so reduce a lot of use cases. So clearly it can't be the best in everyway.  
That really depends on what you need your full node for. On average a most nodes don't care to have blocks 2 minutes after they are discovered... It mostly matters for miners who need their blocks propagated as fast as possible to avoid orphans. Plus you don't double the blocks size, you double the limit, it's not the same.
 
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:59:12
Nicolas Courtois said in substance at a conference that every cold storage was going to get hacked pretty soon because there is no $5k bounty to incentive cryptographs to try and break eliptic curves, thus making them not secure ...

@_date: 2016-03-08 12:38:10
The Other Coin ... so hot right now  
All jokes aside this is something to worry about. An alt coin with more than one third of the trade volume of Bitcoin for days now and 12% of its market cap should be a wake up call. Either we can make Bitcoin buzz positively fast or it may lose the lead in a matter of months ...

@_date: 2016-03-08 13:37:42
Sure but in your first case, legitimate users also pay 10* the fees of the second case.  
Use cases are not limited to microtransactions. 0 conf is possible and happening as we speak.  
Again, depends on what you need it for. If this is so crucial for your use but you can't afford 60k/s upload bandwidth, then you do have a problem (that money solves easily) but that doesn't apply to the majority of nodes.
@_date: 2016-01-18 11:01:00
Well if that ends bitcoin, then bitcoin has already failed.  Is it that hard to imagine what most users want from bitcoin is what will make bitcoin successful in the end ? Because most people you want to convince to use bitcoin don't care about the technical aspect, only about the benefit (in the large sense) they can get from using bitcoin over more traditionnal technologies.

It's opposing digital cash and settlement lay that is deriving from satoshi's vision  
Their is no inherent issue with this system but it is a problem to cripple adoption and useability now to benefit future optimisations that are not ready yet.  
Bitcoin is the most reliable truth machine in the world because people use it and trust it. If only the 1% can use it, then how is it better than the banking system we have now ?   And why would you care about storing lates for eternity now ? You already are by the way, and you will be able to prune them at some point in the futur so what's the big deal ?
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:59:25
segwit is not around the corner, it s far from ready. They released 0.12 without any block increase.

10% of the network nodes isnt exactly nothing. Do you have facts to support your claim that the silent majority supports core ?
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:28:04
If the fork takes over it means the super majority of users and business is behind it. Making what the bitcoin core devs wish and agree on irrelevant. They can join the new train, stay on the old and accept the new rules, or leave at this point, no problem.

That people believe changing the block size limit to 2Mo now is like anything you mention is still beyond me.  
Plus they knew for months now that full blocks would happen, it's not like they didn't have time to plan for it.  
I mean do you seriously believe that 1Mo block = decentralize succes and 2Mo block = centralize failure ?

@_date: 2015-08-04 07:24:57
I love bitcoin and I'm holding mine for a few years now but I have yet to hear a convincing argument against POS. All I hear is that "nothing at stake" argument wich is totally wrong imo.  
Let s say my buddies and I have 60% of all the peercoins, could we rewrite the peercoin blockchain and make a lot of money out of it? I dont think so since everybody could see that we are doing it and peercoin would crash to 0 in no time. We would lose $7M in the process.  
For me POS has two main issues against POW:  
* the initial coin repartition is not as good as POW and doesnt change over time if everydody is forging.  
* the need to have coins in a hot wallet to forge in POS is a security hazard. 
   
On the other hand, POW is more energy consuming.  
  
Does that mean one solution is always better than the other? I dont think so.  
@_date: 2015-08-04 11:55:21
Your scenario works with an organisation with infinite money and power so it is improbable.  
This kind of organisation could destroy POW too.
@_date: 2015-08-04 11:59:36
That s a nice authority argument.  
They still wave around the same stuff: what if someone buys half the coins to attack the network ? What if someone lures noobs by forking the blockchain ? "We made a fundamental analisys and found it's not secure".   That s not very convincing.
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:50:48
Tell me one simple step by step example where any of this wod work with crypto currencies please
@_date: 2015-08-04 12:06:12
If you start from the genesis with 100% of the coins you are free to destroy it but it was yours from the start so it doesn't impact anyone else. If it is that simple why doesnt anybody does it ?
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:52:43
Unfortunately I think they dont want to get involved in sub reddits drama and will just tell us to move to other sub reddits

Except in this case you would need to buy half the houses in the world to burn them and expect the insurance company to pay out even if the whole world could tell it was you who set them on fire.
@_date: 2015-08-04 10:40:07
IN MY OPINION your argument is weak. How can your profit from a falling price if you need more than half the whole stack to attack it to begin with ? Dont you realise you would end up losing much more ?

@_date: 2015-08-04 13:28:22
Sure! Try to acquire 30% of any coin by buying them and watch the price go through the roof to find it's harder and harder to get to the point were you could perpetrate an attack. After your attack your coins are worthless so be ready to lose a bunch of money too.
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:31:27
Well that's so easy then, all you need is a bunch of zero days or infinite money. Sounds so probable.
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:18:13
I'm just stating my opinion and don't think I could add on what's already been said on the subject.  Fees market is not the only viable solution and since ressources like storage and bandwidth are cheap, there is room to increase the blocksize. If you get in the way of greater adoption by removing the promises of cheap and instant transactions, you are going in the wrong direction IMO.
@_date: 2015-07-31 22:02:49
You're correct. They are almost dedicated to running bitcoin nodes and doing ok. CPU is almost useless, RAM is almost always used at 75% by bitcoind. Plus the machine swaps a bit.
@_date: 2015-08-04 11:07:29
Because all these scenarios are higly improbable, very expensive for the attacker and it would be almost free to just fork the blockchain and start again in the case of a catastrophic failure. You can t just take one crypto down, even if it is bitcoin, and bring down the whole ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-07-26 23:09:29
I agree but in this case I believe we could have a much larger blocksize and I don't see the absolute need for a fee market.
What may happen is that business and users will move to other blockchains if they have an incentive to do so. High fees look like a big incentive to me.
@_date: 2015-07-26 08:18:36
The problem is more with the limited number of transactions being confirmed every block
@_date: 2015-07-28 14:24:19
Banks are interested in permissionned ledgers because they have to be compliant with regulations and regulations impose that they can identify every actor (AML, embargoes...), which they can't do naturally using the Bitcoin blockchain.  
Some would LOVE to get rid of KYC and regulations that cost them a lot though

@_date: 2016-02-24 13:31:18
From my experience operating the first exchange that integrated colored coins :  
- Coinprism is not bad but Flavien moved on to another project  
- You'd better not touch Counterparty     
- Omni is in dead waters  
- You can check NXT, which has a nice colored coin system  
I heard good things about colu but didn't try it myself
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:22:55
In the long term maybe but right now I believe there is plenty of room to increase the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-02-24 10:41:33
As opposed to having one syndicate of chinese miners and one company driving the development roadmap ?
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:24:11
from my extensive experience it just doesn't work well and it's a nightmare to keep up to date
@_date: 2015-07-26 08:12:03
You actually only need bitcoins to pay for transaction fees and such on some coins 2.0. So you basically have unlimited assets even with almost no bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:36:10
Adoption is slow because there is a lot of friction with the banking system. Addresses are a non issue.

Sorry but I think this idea is doomed from the start and I ll explain you why :   
If you are not good enough you will lose money and quit pretty soon.  
If you are good enough to make money you will keep going until better players come along and take all your money.  
Soon only the very best stays and all others have quit.  
Project dies if not enough newbies come in to lose money.
anyway good luck to you but dont get your hopes to high.
@_date: 2013-10-13 14:28:22
Chance is a much more important factor in poker though.  Any poker player can beat any pro player with a lucky draw on the river and win a big hand.  No newbie can ever beat a pro sc2 player even with all the luck in the world.  
In the long run both pro will win but in poker a bad player can win some and get hooked. That does not happen in sc2 ever.
@_date: 2013-10-12 23:04:17
Even with that kind of systems, it will be easy for pro players to farm noobies by playing on newly created accounts and stuff...

@_date: 2013-10-13 09:08:13
Of course not.  
It just seems logical to me that if you know precisly the strengh of both opponents (which is pretty easy to know with elo like ratings in skill based games) the worst will have very little incentive to play an EV- game.  
If you arent one of the top players in the world, you will be confronted to this issue often and are prone to quit before getting to the top because it would cost you a lot.
@_date: 2013-10-13 10:55:59

I disagree. With matchmaking games your win rate will be around 50% and games will often be tight and exciting. If you play a specific team, you will have a much better knowledge of your strenght vs the other team and the weakest team will try once but not twice.

How can you prove you wouldn't have taken the money if you had won anyway ?  You can't and no amount of calling this a troll will help you get off easy.  
At the end you didnt do the right thing since it was so bad from the start.  
The settlement was a nice gesture though but it doesnt make up for it imho.  
No need to theorize on who am I : you dont know me because I'm not a vocal person. Still some people like you deserve to be called out on their busllshit.

How bitcoinica was handled by bitcoin consultancy. He is not alone in this but he clearly have his share of responsibilities.
@_date: 2013-10-12 20:25:00
Because some people got rich quick by buying at the right time maybe.
@_date: 2013-10-13 14:47:14
Amir is (was ?) part of bitcoin consultancy who owns Intersango.  
He was responsible for releasing the source code of bitcoinica after a hack in an attempt to prove he was not responsible for the technical issues. This allowed a second hack (or at least its cover up) that made it impossible for users to get back their funds.  
Then he walked away like the rest of the team because it was "too much stress to handle"  
Ho, did I mention he apparently paid back some of his friends before any regular bitcoinica customers got anything back and now the situation has been still for more than a year...
