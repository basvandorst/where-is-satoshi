Hello everybody!
My name is Che, I'm the founder of ANONYM NETWORK
This is an anonymous social network - where people can talk about their problems absolutely anonymously. We with the team launched the project a year ago in Russia and we already have more than 800 thousand users around the world.
And 3 months ago we decided to hold the ICO of our project, but unfortunately our ICO failed, as we spent all our personal money for this event, and did not even collect 20 Eth. Because there are a lot of ICO scammers in the world and many have now ceased to be trusted. We tried to tell everyone about us, but in a rush of advertising ICO we just did not notice. We are very sad and we are in utter confusion and despair.
We have worked hard on our project and We sincerely desire that people could have such a place where they could reveal themselves.
There everyone would be able to find the answer to all questions and, most important, find Themselves again.
I appeal to the world crypto community! We believe in your strength.
And we believe in miracles.
Give a second chance of life to our project. The world and people really need a place where we can talk about what is really important for us
Where it does not matter who you are, how you look and what your social status is. Where only your thoughts and your point of view are valued. Where it is customary to be yourself, communicating without masks and social labels. Where it is possible to find like-minded people, to exercise freethinking and the most important thing is yourself.
We ask you to support our project. We are not scum or hack. This is our work.
We are simple guys who love what they do.
