As someone who goes to Starbucks decently often, the last thing I want is to make my order even longer, because of the cryptocurrencies at the end.

If you aren't using a hardware wallet or an offline computer, you're basically asking for your money to be stolen at this point.

Unfortunately, what this video forgets is that hash functions are rarely broken by brute force. Take a look at SHA-1, for example, which is 160 bits long - if you brute force it, you need to guess 2^160 operations, which is an impossibly large number. However, the actual attack someone found only requires between 2^60.3 and 2^65.3 operations.
The good news, however, is that hash functions are often suspected of being insecure long before they are actually insecure. Nobody wakes up one day and finds that they can suddenly break SHA-1 - they discover something that reduces the security by a "massive" amount (remember, if you go from 2^256 down to 2^246, you've reduced it by several orders of magnitude, which sounds massive but still isn't large enough to have any meaningful effect in practice), which then causes other people to start looking for similar attacks in other parts of the algorithm. Eventually people realize that while a perfect attack hasn't been found, we should probably migrate off of it, because there are too many cracks in the foundation, and a new hash function is selected which happens to not have the flaws mentioned in all the recent papers. Rinse and repeat.

Mining is a process of guessing hashes randomly and hoping that you find something below a certain threshold, and is only fair if everyone is also trying to guess randomly. An attack on a hashing algorithm is like trying to pick lottery numbers, except instead of the only solution being "buy more lottery tickets", you can now just straight up pick the numbers on certain balls. Increasing the difficulty does nothing to compensate for the reduced security.

"New" algorithms in cryptography aren't really a thing. Nothing gets announced only for people to immediately switch to it 20 minutes later. If a weakness is found in SHA-2, people aren't just going to pick something random and switch over - they get their pick of other battle-tested algorithms, which, if they were a person, are probably old enough to drive in every state.
SHA-3, for example (which powers ethereum), is based off of an algorithm called Keccak. It was demoed in 2006, submitted for testing in 2008, advanced to the last round in 2010 after being slightly modified for speed, selected as the winner in 2012, and crowned SHA-3 in 2015. That means people have been trying to attack it seriously for over 8 years, and the best they've been able to do is 2^511.5 time and 2^508 memory.

Somehow, I don't think slow transaction times are hindering major purchases with Bitcoin - the time it takes for a title transfer / legal paperwork to buy a car or house is definitely more than an hour.
