Lol...I've been in this game a long time and I've seen how they rule over the bitcoin channel with an iron fist.  Anything contrary to blockstream is the best will get you kicked out.  Gregory Maxwell has personally told me that Andreas Antonopoulos is an idiot and shouldn't be listened to.  He and the other devs there are funded by the same group that funds blockstream.  They speak terribly of all other programmers and only have their best interests in mind.  If you don't believe me just go in there sometime and ask about Andreas.  You'll see what I'm talking about.

Posters like this should be embarrassed.  They essentially believe crimes aren't committed unless you have proof.  Sorry pal, this isn't a court room and you don't get to decide what others find suspicious.

The best thing we can do is simply get people familiar with using bitcoin with small amounts.  Help install mycelium and electrum wallets and just move 1-10 dollars worth of bitcoin to friends and family.  
This will grow bitcoin more than any other thing.

This is a good way to protect them.  We both know they have to slip up for that and that could happen years after damage has been done.  Until then, we can only judge by behaviors and observation.

It doesn't have anything to do with this.   Most people that don't like bitcoin don't even know about this community and have never heard from bitcoin supporters.  
Most don't like it because it's new and they are not use to comparing their money with other money.  It's a foreign idea to them.  They've never had the option.  The media is also mostly training them to be suspicious of it.
Edit:  Redditors clearly have an overly inflated sense of how much other people get their information from here.  Lol.  I remember telling my father about it a few years ago and he instantly distrusted it and thought it was a scam.  People just do not question money.   Money simply is the US dollar stateside and anything else is monopoly bucks.  (That's the common view.)

Rule Number 1:  If you say anything negative about the mod teams income source, Blockstream, you are a troll.
@_date: 2015-10-01 20:38:14
You don't get banned for that one.   You get banned for pointing out that Gregory Maxwell and his gang of usurpers work for a company whose intention is to keep core functionality of bitcoin weak so they can be first movers on the lightning network.

Sidechains with a MUCH bigger block size sounds perfect.

Blockstream:  Replacing Bitcoin by sneaking in through the sidechain.
@_date: 2015-10-01 23:06:51
Yes, yes...bitcoin is about "software" and not currency.  The software is why everyone is interested in it.  Lolz
It is true that banks love the blockchain software.  Looks like is all in favor of pushing this "just sofware" view.  Maybe they'll modify the software to shrink the blocksize until it's entirely unusable.
SERIOUSLY WON'T SOMEONE SAVE US FROM ALL THIS FREE SOFTWARE?
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:38:32
I think you promoting Greg Maxwell is VERY suspicious.  Sidechains and the first movers in them are just going to fix bitcoin huh?  Here's a thought:  WHY NOT JUST FIX BITCOIN!!

Have the mods ask everyone in a sticky post who upvoted it.
@_date: 2015-10-14 01:31:15
Altcoins don't fix bitcoin's problems.  I wonder how people will feel when the sidechain becomes the only chain people want to use and exchanges are developed around them bypassing the need for bitcoin altogether.  What will bitcoin be then, just a stubby arm that no one has a use for anymore.  Let's just forget about bitcoin core right?  Should this sub be renamed to @_date: 2015-10-05 06:22:31
Yes you are.  You're purposefully deceiving people.  Good luck with your campaign.  
Follow the money folks.  Don't listen to either one of us.  Find out who is paying this guy.  There's a reason he wants to keep block sizes small.  
As far as your log files go, I ABSOLUTELY know what you said about Andreas.  Personally, I think you're trying to destroy bitcoin.  The good thing is we all get to see over the next 20 years.  REMEMBER THAT!

None of the id bullshit has anything to do with bitcoin.  That's you government either trying to "protect" people or slow bitcoin growth.

Now this is a tightly packed bit of fear mongering here.  He covered damn near all the bases in a few sentences.  I'm surprised he didn't say you could contract herpes from unwashed bitcoins.  
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:48:29


I agree that it was inflammatory but you miss the mark on this one.  It is your belief that it is untrue.  Clearly others think you're wrong.  You guys then go on here to have a conversation about disabling voting.  LMFAO!  Now can you imagine why people might thing what I've said is true?  Your behavior is ABSURD!!  DISABLE VOTING?!?!?  NUTS!

The bottom line is they create as much money as they like and loan it to who they like.  Of course they are loaning to friends and family first as long as they can repay (and sometimes even if they can't).  We all would do that.
@_date: 2015-10-10 03:42:59
I second this.  After you play with small amounts using any software/phone app, I recommend getting a cheap laptop, putting [ubuntu]( and [electrum]( on it.  I got mine from [here](
I'm sure you can find cheaper if you look on craigslist.  This is where I store mine locked away ready to go if I need it.  I ONLY use this laptop for this.  Electrum will give you a 12 word seed that you can use to recover your wallet if your laptop dies or you forget your password or whatever.  Make sure you don't lose those and don't give them to anyone.
Of course for trivial amounts, I wouldn't worry about that.
@_date: 2015-10-14 01:21:15
How's this?  It is my belief that the mods here and on bitcoin IRC are being paid by Blockstream's funders.  I formed this belief by observing the pattern that Blockstream is constantly supported and endorsed and negative comments are removed and derided far more frequently than comments about other companies.
It is my assertion that we should be cautious of the intentions of ANY software company that influences bitcoin development.  It is my assertion that removing negative comments about a company is NOT in the spirit of the openness of bitcoin.  
Intentions matter just as much as code.  Denying this just makes this place a joke.  It is very possible that the people funding blockstream want to weaken bitcoin and implement their own self-serving plans in the long run.  Denying that as a possibility is just not honest.
@_date: 2015-10-10 17:15:22
Sounds like him...the bastard.  Just sneak away when he gets excited as the halvening happens and we all get rich or mining collapses and bitcoin goes into a tailspin.  Wait, there's an excellent discussion here where you can read more about it:   
@_date: 2015-10-13 22:30:51
It works like this.  Investors pour a ton of money into blockstream which doesn't produce a damn dime.  What do they want for their money?  What's the end game?  They are so altruistic aren't they.
We're watching...all of you and we won't forget.
@_date: 2015-10-02 22:13:38
Gotta get this lightning network going so Blockstream funders can make some cash.  
Keep the blocksize down too so bitcoin isn't a viable option.

Satoshi got you chained in front of does he?
