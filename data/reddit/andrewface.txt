@_date: 2017-12-22 04:17:04

Check the sub FAQ for wallet options. Yes it’s free. There’s a small fee (few dollars) to move your coins from coinbase to the wallet like with any transaction.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:06:48
Never store your coins on an exchange. You can download a wallet to your phone which will be safer than the exchange but still connected to the internet. Most folks prefer cold storage like the ledger nano s, meaning that it is not connected, so no one can ever possibly remotely access your money.

Good questions. I think mobile wallets use a passcode similar to your phone (finger print/Face ID) and they aren’t linked to your email so there wouldn’t be a password reset. If you forget your code you’d need your private key to recover the wallet.
I’m sure your concerns are valid and probably the reason people prefer cold storage.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:28:15
No there’s a unique phrase (private key) you can use to recover your wallet. With coinbase they hold that key. Not your keys not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:55:17
Yeah I’m not selling until 2030

From one of the best investments to one of the worst
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:58:39
Didn’t think I’d have an opportunity to own a whole bitcoin. Can’t believe I am getting a second chance.
