please PM me non\-horseshit articles, or sell them to me, as they are becoming a scarce commodity, more than BTC. am willing to trade.

not at all. China is busting at the seams and needs Canada &amp; Aus for their strategic expansion as seaports and passages near melting glaciers as I type this post.
this is why Canada's homes will still triple in price by 10 years time.

this all sounds to me like a province that wants to hold a repeated referendum until their outcome to separate from country is achieved, while wanting to hold onto federal benefits, and same currency.

yeah, but Apple made something that the whole world purchased over and over again. from humble beginnings burnt screen LodeRunner systems, to Macintosh in 88 to teach kids about Lotus, to iPods that killed the radio store, to iPads that sent the market into herding cats, to protecting its assets as to prevent Steve Jobs from healing himself, to now, "what's a computer?" that shot themselves in the foot.

so true, as less than a baker's dozen of people have control of over 99% of this money. until we change their hearts, and the entire trickle down flowchart of capitalism, crypto will still be over 200 years away from being the new tender. it will also take a bloody war that will last at least that long to get it done.
