Honestly, I'm baffled about how UASF is supposed to work. I get the impression that shaolinfry didn't think it through very well.
If you want to create a consensus rule that even un-upgraded clients will follow, you need a majority of hashpower.

Are you kidding? He was famous for how much he went after white collar and financial crimes, even opening some [pretty questionable cases](

I'm curious how you get from this to "and therefore they'll stop blocking it soon," rather than, "and therefore they'll do this until they get what they want, i.e. Bitcoin Core endorsing a larger blocksize."


My impression was that mining firms were supporting Core less because they thought Core was making good decisions, and more because they wanted to avoid the fragmentation of authority that would make a hardfork much harder.

I think, in general, you shouldn't assume people are arguing in bad faith. In this case, parent commenter thanked me for the correction. If you're nice to people and you have backing facts, you can convince most.

How do you know that UASF has the support of, say, a majority of users? It doesn't have any voting mechanism. (Or rather, it intentionally ignores the voting system if it gets the wrong result.)
When UASF was proposed on list, the author suggested that it would work if Bitcoin exchanges banded together and refused to exchange non-UASF coins for miners. Exactly the 'cabal' approach that you (correctly) reject!
