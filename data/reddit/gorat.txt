You mean if you use log scale
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:35:02
But how then do you exchange the btc or buy things? That's why we need infrastructure.

Well done guys, hope to see this in Greece soon as well.
Μπράβο παιδιά, μακάρι να το δούμε και στην Ελλάδα σύντομα.

We are many many immigrants in the US and always need to send money across borders and banks SUCK at this.

And what makes you think that when MessiahSuperCoin is created they will not ban it anyway?

except if said pot smokers are black males 20 - 30 yrs old

Well doge had been going for a month. Give it another year and we'll see how helpful people will be.

Isn't tax policy defined state by state though? I know that we'll probably all follow the German model but it COULD be taxed differently in another state right? If not please post here when you make an ATM I think Greece is ripe for some financial 'security' away from banks. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:26:09
what? I was not talking about the original article, the guy was talking about cops being lenient on pot smokers and I just said that they are not so lenient on black pot smokers.
And not to make it about race. What I meant was that some people think that just because they are priviledged enough not to be affected by some laws that the police/court usually chooses not to use vs them (because race or whatever) then these laws "are just technicalities". But these laws are actively used against other people to fuck them over.
So going back to OP. People think that our financial laws don't really affect them especially when they are going through the main bank channels. As soon as they start looking on the sidelines they see where the fence of the law is. It is not like the state is cracking down on btc use but they have tools in order if they ever need to or in a case by case basis.
Happy now?
@_date: 2014-02-04 13:58:53
Do you have any idea what the legal status is on Greece? I can imagine they will try to find a way to tax the shit out of it.

You guys need to get some local businesses to sell with bitcoin. There is no other reason to make bitcoin if you can't use it... It's not like the price is stable.

Can you link to a list? I am going to Athens in 3 weeks and I would love to be able to use BTC
@_date: 2013-10-07 14:36:07
They probably asked the suspect guy to explain it and he was like "there is a shitload of coins in there but you'll never crack it muahahaaaa"

Isn't brent about 100 usd per barrel? So you are waiting for your btc to devaluate 5 times?

Yahoo before there was a search engine = Yahoo back in 1997 = imagine a yellow pages / catalog of websites. It would have sections like Sports / Finance / Games etc and then when you clicked it would have some websites and subcategories. So what I understand from OP is that now there is Sports / Finance / Games / Bitcoin etc. Which is great news. Equivalent to making one of the main subreddits on the front page for a website that half the chinese internet traffic goes through. Too the moon!
edit: Yahoo.com from 1997

Buy some Greek state bonds is the most safe investment... (that's what the bank was saying 5 years ago before the economic crisis started). You want to know how to lose money ask the banker how to invest.

yeah that was what I was going to do, but then read on here that their security is bad and I shouldn't trust them. Am I being paranoid?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:19:33
Thank you, I knew it was somewhere obvious...
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:39:24
just put the BTC number in parentheses or something.

Millis are the present, let's hope micros are the future!
A milli for a buck!

1 dollar is worth 100 centidollars (cents)
1 bitcoin is worth 100 centibitcoins (centis) is worth 1000 millibitcoins (millis)

OK - this is solid advice!
thank you...

you know what man? 
I'm internet savvy and understand how the system works. The main problem is that there are way too many options and some of them may be scams or too hard to use. If we want this thing to take off and the average joe to start using it then it has to become way easier to do...
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:33:47
Milli or Mil
it's simple and to the point. Or mil (as we use for volumes in science nobody says milliliter or microliter its a mil and a micro)

Mt.Gox was my first experience with BTC and the reason why I didn't get BTC when it was 70$ (it was too hard to get in back then). Coinbase is WAY easier and user friendly... I made my first small sale of coins recently just to try it and see how it works. I believe that the fact that so many shops are starting to accept BTC to buy stuff should make it easier to liquidate your coins in the near future.

ten bucks per milli will be epic!
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:53:50
Why do you think its harder to sell than buy? Using Coinbase I can just cash out to my bank account directly (1% fee). Same with buying (1% fee).

I am not to decide. There are tests that decide who is mentally ill (their accuracy is another beast), but if someone "willingly" wants to kill himself for whatever reason I would deem them mentally ill and a danger to themselves (and possibly others). I didn't say I would put the audience under treatment, I said that talking mentally ill or retarded people and putting them on tv so that other people can laugh at them (many talent / reality shows do that) should be highly moderated. And I would rather err on the side of caution rather than freedom in this one.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:49:15
I was trying to buy more at the good price when it dipped not sell... Of course I'm holding but I would have saved a pretty penny on the dip... 
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:45:08
more like a serf :) yeah good luck getting payed in "real money" in a company...
@_date: 2013-10-07 16:33:06
Because (I believe and the law believes) that if someone is mentally ill and in danger of doing harm on oneself they should be stopped by the state and given treatment. I have a big problem with (some) reality shows for similar reasons (mentally ill people milked for money instead of given treatment)
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:36:01
just milli is better and then the context can be inferred.

that's why the change must happen now before these people start having access and we get stuck with inches and feet.

Yes I did try it and got a message saying that for the first transaction you have to wait until it goes through.
