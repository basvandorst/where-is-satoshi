You are so wrong about everything you just said I don't even know where to start to correct you.

So I used coinbase to buy in and was attempting to get my eth to coinspot. Only reason I wanted to sell was to get my money somewhere without a stupidly low limit.
I did end up going through kraken. But krakens UI is so terrible that I didn't see how I could trade directly between eth and xbt and ended up going through USD so had to wait for the confirmations and pay fees on both ends (ended up seeing the direct trade eventually but why the 'to' currency is not on the sell form and instead on the header banner is beyond me).
Not planning on cashing out. But my point is the ecosystem is clunky and disjointed right now. I shouldn't need advice from an internet forum to join.

Will give it a shot if coinspot doesn't work out. Thanks for the suggestion.

I agree with you.
It doesn't change the fact that the ecosystem today is disjointed

Definitely more important than networking protocols, database, or public key crypto papers...

I was trying to keep it in crypto. 
But the acceptance of crypto changes depending on the site. Not all sites will provide receiving wallets for all their coins hence having to diasy chain multiple services to get where I wanted. Not a good first experience for the layperson.

This argument doesn't really work.
If you want everyone to use cryptos the UX needs to be on par with fiat. Which it is not.

I jumped back in today.
Bought eth with fait on coinbase. Hit a $300 limit. Whoops don't want to use them if the limit is that low. Oh, you're allowed to buy but not allowed to sell on coinbase in our country (Australia). Lets find a new service then. Oh, the service you want to use wont accept eth, you need btc. OK lets work through another exchange. Finally get my eth to btc to transfer.
It's not just one service. The whole ecosystem is messy af.

What makes you think these companies will avoid AML/CTF regulations in future. As crypto gets more popular the regulators will start to take notice.
The amount of fraud on credit cards would be similar (if not less) as a percentage on crypto fraud. Because in crypto all the security is on the user with little to no oversight - why do you think all those viruses ask for the ransom in crypto.
Most of the terrible UX is in the wholey crypto world. Wallet addresses are enormous hashes, the websites for the most part seem to have never seen a UX specialist, I have to wait for confirmations before my money moves resulting in my account at both ends showing zero for a time. I do think it will get a lot better and it will be great but saying the poor UX is to do with the interface between those worlds is completely false.

Most countries around the world have this.
Why would I want tradeoffs when the currency systems around the world already move my money in seconds, cost me nothing and transferring money is as easy as selecting a contact in my phone and clicking send.

Ha. You got me there. 
Liquid money.

Then btc isn't 'money'. It's a store of value like gold.
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:23:23
That's like saying gold would be money but noone can be fucked weighing it.
Gold could be money (it once was and could be again), but today it is a store of value involving a high transaction fee to use it as money.

A 60 billion dollar currency is not very big. Apple, a single company, has a market cap 15x that. 
In the last 2 days which saw huge volatility only $2B of BTC was traded. This is very low.
It's a lot of money to a layperson like you or I. But in the grand scheme of things, its just not that much.

Except swift would most likely not allow bitcoin addresses in their system as they cannot trust who you are.

You've obviously never told a cc company you never made a certain transaction.
While they say you can be liable they'll almost always give you back your money as their interest is in your repeat business.
