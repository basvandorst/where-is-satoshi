I like it-- especially the cap doubling every 2 years. We definitely need reassurance in the future there will be an increase. Thanks for *doing* something Gavin, and for your strong-willed perseverance despite the loud (albeit minority) opinions to the contrary.

I support both your idea and Jeff Garzik's BIP100. Either one of them would be acceptable to me. I am just curious about your reasoning for why you chose to proceed with your approach instead of what's proposed in BIP100? Thanks, if you have a moment.

Mike was actually willing to discuss worst case scenarios, because he's an honest guy willing to look at all sides of this. Those who are in favor of leaving the block size the same haven't been as outspoken about the worst case scenarios.

Basically you're going for the lowest block size that 75% or more votes agree on.
It's a two step process:
Let's say 10 people voted in the past x blocks with these values for their block-size vote: **[6,8,1,20,2,3,2,2,10,1]**
* 1.) Sort all the votes (in an array) from highest to lowest size vote. Let's say 10 people voted. Your *sorted* array would then look like this: **[20,10,8,6,3,2,2,2,1,1]**  
* 2.) Now all the work is done for you. Simply go to the array element 75% of the way through **['2' in the example above]**, or 90% of the way through **['1' in the example above]** and that array element will contain the size of the blocks to use. Again, the 75% or 90% is whatever is chosen is best to be considered a majority.
And of course you will want to ensure there is a minimum and maximum block size change per adjustment, in case the votes went wonky or try to be manipulated.

@_date: 2015-06-04 05:18:03
I understand trying to avoid a sudden surge, but changing the blocksize cap every day is a little ridiculous. We haven't changed the block size in a couple *years* and all of a sudden we feel the need to do it daily? Once every 1 or 2 weeks should be just fine, and will prevent the block-size from being gamed intentionally.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:43:54
I want to know the same thing. Because then I'd use purse.io again if I knew it wasn't supporting fraud.
@_date: 2015-06-17 05:07:52
As for an explanation of why I want to know who wrote that "contentious" policy:
I just feel it is completely unacceptable for one individual who happens to own the domain bitcoin.org, which is for a decentalized and global phenomeon, to decide what should be shown to public eyes and what should be hidden. If it was his own personal business then that would be 100% fine. But it is not. If public is fed only particular options, and intentionally prevented from seeing other options, then that basically makes the site owner the regulating body over bitcoin to a degree. Fortunately there are other avenues with which new ideas in bitcoin can be spread. But bitcoin.org is a major one. And it's one I would expect would remain neutral.
To make an analogy, to me it is the same as the Presidential races in America. You get a selection between two major candidates, usually a Republican and a Democrat. But they are really two flavors of the same thing. Other parties don't usually get much of a shot. Either because they are censored (in Ron Paul's case) or because they just don't have the funding.
In our case, with Bitcoin, a block size increase might be considered to be the 3rd party. But because that 3rd party is blocked from being seen, it can never come to be selected by people merely because they will never know it existed. (Or not enough will know it existed to make a change).
I feel it is censorship.

My guess is the people who claim ethical objections are actually speaking out of their own fear of financial loss.

Yeah, it's all relative. 1mb might seem like a reasonable hard-minimum now, but it will be nothing in many years. In fact 1mb would be crippling eventually.

@_date: 2015-06-09 17:21:35
Correct. There's really 2 requirements for it to go into effect:
1.) A certain high percentage adoption
2.) A particular block number
If either of those requirements are not met, then the 20mb block change does not go into effect. It only goes into effect if they both are met.

I had this same confusion a year ago when it came to the divisibility notion of bitcoin. I felt like it created more units of the currency and that this was unfair because it violated the claim of 21 million btc total. And I'm really good at math, so this confusion was a bit embarrassing. It's 
So I posted my question in a thread like this one and after much discussion (and realizing I was wrong) I finally saw what people were saying. My claim that more currency was being created was foolish.
Yes, moving the decimal point to the right may create more *subdivisions* of the currency, but existing holders of the currency have that many more subdivisions of the currency as well, so it's completely fair.

I understand trying to avoid being caught off-guard a sudden surge, but that's also the point (for protection against spam attacks).
Changing the block size every day is a little overkill if you think about it: We haven't changed the block size in a couple years and all of a sudden we feel the need to do it daily? Once every 1 or 2 weeks should be just fine, and will prevent the block-size from being gamed intentionally.

Oh gosh, now the word "contentious" is being thrown about. I think it's sickening how many times you and I have both used this new &amp; over-used word "contentious". Gross.
A person can claim any new code is "contentious" when it hasn't been adopted yet. But how could you allow it to not be contentious if you never even gave it a chance in the case of a majority voting system?
The voting mechanism being used would see if there is a majority in favor. But if you label anything new as "contentious" before even allowing people to adopt it then you've just stopped the vote from happening, under this guise that anything new is "contentious". Maybe a majority of people actually do want it, but it was never given it a chance because it was labelled stopped before-hand.
That's not a free system. That's a system controlled by those determining what they consider "contentious" or not. They're trying to decide *for* others. But isn't that what the vote would be doing on its own?
I too am running XT. And definitely want these power-tripping individuals removed. I'm referring to Theymos, nullc, Peter Todd, etc.

I understand your points and respect that. You're right-- I did take a snippet out of context to make him look stupid. I did it because I didn't like his tone for the entire interview.  I have deleted the YouTube clip just to back up my words with action.
My full thoughts (with the entire podcast taken in mind) would be best summed up as follows:
The entire time Peter is speaking it just feels weird, like he is an expert at saying one thing and meaning another. I think he is a covert individual and puts on an excellent public face. He is also very intelligent so this gives him the ability to think of very logical-*sounding* arguments for nearly everything and the ability to talk his way out of nearly anything.
I get this unsettling vibe from Peter which I completely do not get that from Gavin. Gavin comes across at face value. I strongly feel that what you see is what you get with Gavin. With Peter, I think it's a morass of hidden agendas and motivations that are not expressed outwardly.
It's ok for people to be wrong. Even if satoshi is wrong about something, then that's fine. That's human nature. Everybody is wrong sometimes. I think you're correct that I was wrong for taking Peter's quote out of context and trying to make him look stupid. 
The way Peter goes about it however just feels very *weird*. I can't be the only one who feels that way when he is talking. And I don't want someone like him influencing Bitcoin's development.

What I don't get is how Mike's proposal is considered contentious. It's software you can CHOOSE to run, or NOT run. And by running it you are putting a vote in to make the change. If there's not enough votes, then nothing happens. So how is that contentious? If a majority of people were running the software then that would mean they wanted a change!

Shouldn't we use a longer time-span than 144 blocks?
    144 blocks / avg 6 blocks per hour = 24 hours
That's only 1 past day worth of time to determine the blocksize limit for the next block. The longer the time-span, the longer a sustained spam attack would take to game the system. And that would be more costly. 1 day isn't very long.
Difficulty is calculated every 2 weeks on average. What's wrong with using 2 weeks as a time frame? It's not like we need to change block-sizes every single day.
I propose we use 2016 blocks instead. (2 weeks)

It doesn't immediately increase the bandwidth by factor of 20. That will most likely take **many years** to happen. This change only increases the LIMIT on the block size allowed.
Blocks are not instantaneously going to become 20mb blocks if that update goes into effect.

Thanks for your work on this. Some of us want to take action now.
We're showing our vote of support for the future blocksize increase by adopting Bitcoin XT *now*.
And yes, if you updated XT to incorporate the Core 0.10.2 changes, that would (if nothing else) help eliminate the confusion on which version is best to run.
As a side question: Is there an easy way to see the number of Bitcoin XT nodes running? I think my user agent reports as a regular 0.10.1 Core node, so it's difficult to tally the total number of XT-specific users. Perhaps the user agent being could be updated to report it's actually the XT version and not Core. I'd submit the change myself if I knew what I was doing. Or did you leave it that way on purpose for compatibility purposes?

I don't think "subtle" works as a promotion strategy
@_date: 2015-06-17 04:54:09
Sure. I will do my best to explain my viewpoint and logic.
First, to find the post, you must click on "blog" at the bottom of bitcoin.org. It takes you here: 
It's the first link:  [Bitcoin.org Hard Fork Policy - Jun 16, 2015](
As for an explanation, I just feel it is completely unacceptable for one individual who happens to own the domain bitcoin.org, which is for a decentalized and global phenomeon, to decide what should be shown to public eyes and what should be hidden. If it was his own personal business then that would be 100% fine. But it is not. If public is fed only particular options, and intentionally prevented from seeing other options, then that basically makes the site owner the regulating body over bitcoin to a degree. Fortunately there are other avenues with which new ideas in bitcoin can be spread. But bitcoin.org is a major one. And it's one I would expect would remain neutral.
To make an analogy, to me it is the same as the Presidential races in America. You get a selection between two major candidates, usually a Republican and a Democrat. But they are really two flavors of the same thing. Other parties don't usually get much of a shot, either because they are censored by media (in Ron Paul's case) or because they just don't have the funding.
In our case, with Bitcoin, a block size increase might be considered to be the 3rd party. Bitcoin.org's new policy is acting as the censor. Because that 3rd party is at least partially blocked from being seen, it may never come to be selected by people merely because they will never know it existed (Or not enough will know it existed to make a change). Like Ron Paul being blocked by media to prevent him from getting enough exposure to win an election.
I feel it is censorship.

@_date: 2015-06-15 17:29:57
I wish someone had given me that example back when I didn't get it :P
It's a good one.
I think the basic misunderstanding is the difference between quantity and division. People thinking more quantity is always MORE (like the little girl in the OP video who thinks the two smaller crackers are the same as the two bigger crackers because there's two). The lesson is that you can't ignore the SIZE of the quantities involved.

@_date: 2015-06-09 03:57:48
True, however these polls include all users, including those with the hash power. The numbers *against* an increased block-size just aren't very considerable no matter which way you look at it. It's actually a landslide.
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:20:00
I'm guessing it's someone who wants to acquire a good amount of bitcoin fairly quickly but doesn't want to spike the price more than he can, so spreading it out allows the market to absorb some of the effects of his buying.

But if the *vast majority* of bitcoiners want the equivalent of "an armed overthrow" of the existing bitcoin system, then it should be allowed and it should occur. That is what a majority is all about (and no I'm not just talking about 51%. A considerable majority.. 70-80%). By taking a stance like this you are becoming akin to the American government who decides *for* the people. Do you not trust the people? Do you feel you are smarter than them? Obviously the answer seems to be yes.
The Revolutionary War was an example of people taking arms and deciding they did not like how their rulers were deciding things for them (England taxing colonies). The block-size debate may come to a Revolutionary War where you are on the side of England when we take it by force. Why put yourself on a side? Just remain neutral and go with what Bitcoin becomes. It will become what people want it to become. There's no reason to pigeon hole yourself in a corner by declaring you won't follow certain things. Actually, the more I write this, the more I realize you are actually only harming yourself. A movement will occur regardless of your policy. I hope you reconsider for your own sake or some day you may find yourself doing one of two things: 1.) "eating crow" because you were wrong, or 2.) becoming irrelevant and ignored.

We should have nothing to be afraid of. If we're afraid of bad actors, then we have things to fix. If the value of bitcoin were go to UP considerably, and THEN be broken, the damage would be a heck of a lot worse.
While the last stress tests provided some good information, they did not cause enough tangible effects and so they could be ignored. I would say most people ignore something until it becomes a problem for them personally. It's unfortunate, but that's how most people operate.

@_date: 2015-06-04 04:34:53
I understand trying to avoid a sudden surge, but changing the blocksize every day is actually a little ridiculous.  We haven't changed the block size in a couple years and all of a sudden we feel the need to do it daily? Once every 1 or 2 weeks should be just fine, and will prevent the block-size from being gamed intentionally.
@_date: 2015-06-26 01:46:11
I solved this problem by running [Netlimiter 4]( on my Windows 8.1 machine. I agree with you-- if the bitcoin node eats up ALL my upstream bandwidth, then my internet connection becomes un-usuable. So the only way is to limit it.
Now I run my bitcoin node 24/7 and can watch movies and play games and it's fine :)
I have DSL with about 1.5MB downstream and 150KB upstream, so I set NetLimiter to limit Bitcoin Core to 1.17MB down 100KB upstream. I found that was the max before I noticed bandwidth performance degradation in other areas. I highly recommend this solution as it's been working great for me.
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:53:15
*probably* doesn't feel too compelling
@_date: 2015-06-20 05:45:14
I agree. I think it may have the effect of getting things to move a lot more quickly in the area of solutions for handling more transactions.

Not yet in this version. But it will be added here even if it is not added in Core. It also shows a bit of support ahead of time, like a pre-vote.
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:53:41


But you and I both know that won't happen. The number of transactions will continue as they have been. Increasing the max block size does not increase the number of transactions being executed on the network. And even if it did instantly, magically jump to 20mb full blocks, hardware right now is not so shitty that it can't handle 20mb blocks. But again, that isn't what's going to happen in reality. So please keep that in mind if you decide to respond to this.

This is mostly FUD backed up by the fact that it's not happening now. But even if it did happen, most miners *can* handle 20mb blocks. This is why it's good there's not an *unlimited* block size.
And as [gizmo said]( Every time a change is made like this, a hard fork is required. If you only increase to say 5mb, that means we'll have to do another hard fork in a year or two. Raising it to 20mb now buys more time for a permanent solution.
Performing a hard fork is not exactly pleasant to carry out on a massive scale for all parties involved. And this will only get more difficult as time goes on.

[Based on every single poll I've ever seen on the subject of whether or not to increase the blocksize]( the majority of people do want the increase. In fact, I've never come across a poll where the majority did **not** want not to do it.
So why would you put a what a smaller group of individuals wants over what the masses wants? That makes no sense and seems highly dictatorial.
It actually matters more what the majority of the bitcoin users want.

He gives one of the greatest, simplest explanations (with visuals) of what a blockchain is and does. I've never seen it broken down so well, personally.
As a side note, I also learned things about the Namecoin blockchain that I never knew before (what exactly Namecoin does and what was changed when it forked from Bitcoin).
Really well presented.

Good show. The first speaker's intro is really tiresome though... spreading completely misinformed information about blockchain being important and bitcoin just being this currency on the top that's not so interesting. It doesn't work without the fuel, buddy!

I'd love a gradually increasing blocksize. I didn't think that option was realistically on the table for sake of consensus. Like I said, there are as many solutions to the block size problem as there are people in Bitcoin. It's a good way of getting nothing done. I hope sincerely we can agree on something, but it seems that with each new idea the solutions get spread thinner and thinner over more and more options.

I wish more people took this into account. It seems like they think it will just instantly be 20mb blocks when they talk about how "their bandwidth cannot handle the new 20mb max block size". Well what about their bandwidth in 5 years? That's a more accurate comparison.

I agree-- we should use a longer time-span than 144 blocks.
144 blocks / avg 6 blocks per hour = 24 hours
That's only 1 day worth of time to determine the blocksize limit for the next day. The longer the time-span, the longer a sustained spam attack would take to game the system. And that would be more costly. 1 day isn't very long.
Difficulty is calculated every 2 weeks on average. What's wrong with using 2 weeks as a time frame? It's not like we need to change block-sizes every single day.
I propose we use 2016 blocks instead. (2 weeks)

I have been a happy Coinbase customer for almost 2 years. I have done a LOT of business with them. I especially like their instant-buy feature. Their service has been steller and I have nothing to complain of service-wise.
But just today, I thought to check the prices between Circle and Coinbase, and I found that Circle is actually a little bit cheaper. Coinbase's bitcoin price is lower but the fees are higher, and while Circle's bitcoin price is a little bit higher, there are no fees (they are probably figured into the price).
So from now on I am going to be buying from Circle (or at least checking the prices between the two sites). I just wanted to share this in case anyone else didn't know.
Check before you buy. You might save a few bucks.

As for an explanation, I just feel it is completely unacceptable for one individual who happens to own the domain bitcoin.org, which is for a decentalized and global phenomeon, to decide what should be shown to public eyes and what should be hidden. If it was his own personal business then that would be 100% fine. But it is not. If public is fed only particular options, and intentionally prevented from seeing other options, then that basically makes the site owner the regulating body over bitcoin to a degree. Fortunately there are other avenues with which new ideas in bitcoin can be spread. But bitcoin.org is a major one. And it's one I would expect would remain neutral.
To make an analogy, to me it is the same as the Presidential races in America. You get a selection between two major candidates, usually a Republican and a Democrat. But they are really two flavors of the same thing. Other parties don't usually get much of a shot. Either because they are censored (in Ron Paul's case) or because they just don't have the funding.
In our case, with Bitcoin, a block size increase might be considered to be the 3rd party. But because that 3rd party is blocked from being seen, it can never come to be selected by people merely because they will never know it existed. (Or not enough will know it existed to make a change).
I feel it is censorship.

Yeah this is a very good point. There's at least a chance that Gavin's estimations will be workable for a considerable time to come. And there's even a chance we will never have to fork again. But if we do nothing now, then it's pretty much guaranteed will have to fork it. So by doing what Gavin is doing, we at least have a chance to minimize the future forking.

I think there are too many ideas out there. Everybody has their own "best way" to do this. And we'll get nowhere.

There are as many solutions as there are people. I suggest sticking to one of the main solutions if we want to actually get something accomplished.

What I don't get is how it's contentious. It's software you can CHOOSE to run, or NOT run. And by running it you are putting a vote in to make the change. If there's not enough votes, then nothing happens. So how is that contentious? If a majority of people were running the software then that would mean they wanted a change!
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:43:17
Also, what if not everyone selects the same size block as their "vote"? Then there would be no majority, just a huge number of different votes.
I propose the vote counting should accept the majority of votes which include any votes bigger in size as well. This way you can have a base-line block size even if votes are scattered. It's best to illustrate this with an example:
Miner 1 votes 19mb block size
Miner 2 votes 15mb block size
Miner 3 votes 20mb block size
Miner 4 votes 16mb block size
In the above example, we know that 75% of the miners are okay with **at least** 16mb as the block size. Some want more. But the majority agreed on 16mb
Also, notice using the above example that there is no single size that wins alone.

Mike goes on to explain that Bitcoin XT will use a majority-voting mechanism before the increased block-size change goes into effect, so that it only goes into effect if a certain percentage of nodes are using it.

**common misconception:** "20MB is too big of a jump"
**answer:** It's just a *maximum* block-size **limit**. It does not mean we are going to instantly start making 20mb blocks. Blocks will continue growing at their current pace. This is perhaps the biggest misconception that we will somehow suddenly start seeing 20mb blocks just because the limit is raised.

So you think that the minority opinion should be what is running, as far as software goes? I mean, it really comes down to that. I don't think you do, but that's what you said without saying it directly.
I think you should software vote what the majority wants, and the rest will follow by force. But it's better than following what the minority wants, because it's the minority!
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:48:18
Even if it did happen, most miners *can* handle 20mb blocks. This is why there's not an *unlimited* block size.
And as [gizmo said]( Every time a change is made like this, a hard fork is required. If you only increase to say 5mb, that means we'll have to do another hard fork in a year or two. Raising it to 20mb now buys more time for a permanent solution.
Performing a hard fork is not exactly easy to carry out on a massive scale for all parties involved. And this will only get more difficult as time goes on.
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:10:41

As Meni Rosenfeld said so elegantly in regard to the ongoing block-size debate:




It seems there are as many solutions to the block size problem as there are people in Bitcoin.
We are nearly out of time, folks. This is because it takes *time* for the new version of the software to simply get adopted by enough people. By Gavin's estimates 6-12 months. And this isn't counting the time to develop and test the new software.
I think the best solution (for sake of simplicity and time constraints) is to upgrade to 20mb blocks now. It's fast to implement, and it buys us more time. It's *not* a complete solution in itself, because the 20mb blocks will eventually get maxed out again.
So it's a 2 stage approach.
Stage 1 of the solution is to increase blocks to 20mb now as an "immediate" (6-12 months) fix. And stage 2 is to develop, test and implement other things such as Lightning Network, StrawPay (Stroem), side chains and whatever else gets designed. After that we may never need to touch the block-size again. 
By doing it this way we have some *time* to develop these solutions into existence. If we had a fully operating Lightning Network/Side Chains/Etc. currently, then this might be a different discussion. But right now they are just notes on paper. And notes on paper aren't going to do much good in 6-12 months when our 1mb blocks get filled.
The bottom line is 1mb is not enough for anything to innovate on top of it. 20mb is really no better than 1mb, except that it 1.) buys us some much needed time, and 2.) allows these other options to run where 1mb would be too limiting. So let's fix the block size now so that these other solutions do have some space to operate.
Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja (Lightning Network creators) themselves even stated that the Lightning Network acts as a sort of amplifier for number of transactions on the existing block space. (For example, you might get a 20x increase in the number of transactions allowed in a block, but it still depends on the basic block size as a starting point).

Exactly. If the good guys can do it, then the bad guys can and will do it.

That's like saying that no one else's opinion matters though, even the majority.
Also coders are not necessarily financial experts. I don't trust a coder to be any more skilled at determining the specifications of a piece of financial software.

What's the solution?
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:42:34
This is mostly FUD backed up by the fact that it's not happening now. But even if it did happen, most miners *can* handle 20mb blocks. This is why it's good there's not an *unlimited* block size.
And as [gizmo said]( Every time a change is made like this, a hard fork is required. If you only increase to say 5mb, that means we'll have to do another hard fork in a year or two. Raising it to 20mb now buys more time for a permanent solution.
Performing a hard fork is not exactly easy to carry out on a massive scale for all parties involved. And this will only get more difficult as time goes on.

I think this is a false reason though. For two reasons:
1.) Blocks will not become 20mb right away. That will take many, many years. We are only talking about the **maximum** size being raised. 
2.) If you take a look at hardware advances *since the 1mb block limit was put in place*, then why haven't we increased the limit accordingly, in-ratio? You can look at it that way too. If you think hardware will not be able handle 20mb blocks by the time they happen, I think this is a poor estimation of technology advances.
**The reverse way of stating it:** Should we leave the limit at 1mb despite increases in storage capacity and bandwidth? I think that also is lacking in logic.

I created XTnodes.com to track the number of Bitcoin XT nodes as more and more people begin to use it. This was following Mike Hearn's announcement:


Mike goes on to explain that Bitcoin XT will use a majority-voting mechanism before the increased block-size change goes into effect, so that it only goes into effect if a certain percentage of nodes are using it.

Hopefully these charts will be useful in seeing when we have a significant enough adoption of the client for future block-size changes to occur. (The exact percentage needed is yet to be announced)

Attention Lawyers. Here is a very good argument for a Class Action lawsuit against BFL (Butterfly Labs) for incredibly late Monarch development and refused refunds.
This is due to extremely late Monarch development and refusal of customer refunds. Links to supporting evidence below, as well as estimated delivery dates which were not kept and estimates and impressions given customers which turned out to be completely false.
Also, please up-vote it on reddit so it gets more attention (and hopefully a lawyer's):

I created this 3 minute video compilation of Roger Ver speaking on why Bitcoin is such an invaluable and amazing gift to mankind.
I made it very concise and to the point so it is useful for sharing with people who don't want to spend 30-60 minutes watching podcasts and lectures.

Yes, BFL offered a refund or "upgrade" on March 18, 2014 when the orders were already 7 months late. At the time of the offered upgrade it was stated that there would be approximately only 5 more weeks to wait. So many people accepted this "upgrade". Now it is 18 weeks later and it's still not done. But BFL won't refund these customers.
It's highly fraudulent.
The reason I keep putting "upgrade" in quotes is because any gain that speed increase they promised to an Imperial Monarch has been lost many months ago in delays. In fact, BFL's monarch is so outdated price-wise already that you can find similar speed hardware now for $500 (BFL's cost $4680)

I say just release the updated version with an increased block size, and see how many people update it.
It's a voluntary choice to update. That's the vote.
There will always be someone in opposition, and someone for it. Majority voice (by node adoption) will be the result that goes into effect. So a lot of debate isn't required really. Just release the new version, and let the people decide what to run.
I have a feeling from the general comments that I've seen on all bitcoin channels that the majority will adopt the larger blocks. But if it isn't adopted, well then that is what the majority wanted.
So the sooner you release it so people can decide with their **vote** by running it, the better.

@_date: 2015-05-10 03:47:10
Yes, it is using low end hardware. But I didn't think this could be the reason because every time I have checked task manager to see the cpu utilization and the bandwidth utilization, they are like 1-10% each. It doesn't appear that the hardware is being overstressed. Wouldn't this be the case if it was maxing out?
I wanted to use low power consumption, so I put it on an a little Acer atom netbook. It's a 1.6ghz atom processor. The processor is slow as hell lol. But it's not maxed out or even close! It's 2gb memory and a 160gb unused harddrive (another reason why I chose it).
I have DSL which is 1200kb downstream and 140kb upstream. But bitcoin core is only using like 40-60kb/sec down, and only about 5kb/sec up.

A backlog of **transactions waiting to be confirmed in a block** was caused because there were more transactions in bitcoin nodes' memories than could be output into a single block (i.e., 8mb of transactions and only 750kb-1mb blocks to put them in). Therefore all the awaiting transactions couldn't be put into a single block and couldn't exhaust the transactions in the memory pool-- they had to be carried over to the next block. But by the time the next block came by, more transactions had accumulated (in addition to those already waiting), preventing the memory pool from being exhausted again. And so on. This lasted for 8 hours, in this particular stress test.

This is correct-- luckily Bitcoin has other uses than just competing with existing payment rails. But that is a considerable portion of it, especially right now. Currency is the first app and currently the most widely used aspect of Bitcoin and the blockchain. So I don't think it should be discounted in importance just because bitcoin has other abilities.

I would be interested in seeing the answer to [ question by px403 above]( too.
Also, I feel the block-size solution should include a long-term solution as well as this short-term 20mb "band-aid", because the ability to pull off majority adoption of future hard-forks increases in difficulty as time goes on, with more and more nodes to upgrade. Why go through this again if we can handle it with one well-thought-out blow? Save the future pain of it.
But I am totally in favor of some kind of increased block limit solution. It has to happen some way or other for Bitcoin to scale to the mainstream use that we all want to see it at.

That was before the market needed to correct due to the false price inflation the Willy bot caused. Otherwise I believe it *would* go up in good news. The continual price correcting makes it appear to be "going down on bad news".
As an example,  when the Microsoft announced it was accepting a bitcoin the price went up briefly on the news. But it went down continually after that because the price was still correcting 
@_date: 2015-05-27 03:34:56
This is why we need to do a hard-fork as few times as possible, and ideally never again, using side chains and/or lightning network in the future to solve the same issues. But even those won't run on 1mb blocks.

I can appreciate the desire for predictability and standardization, but I don't think this will work in the long run because as time goes on it will become increasingly difficult to get majority adoption of hard forks. So we should get in the changes early on in the game. Eventually, like ipv4, the technology will be so deeply embedded and rooted in society that changing it will be nearly impossible. At that time, we hopefully have a very workable bitcoin model.
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:38:50

@_date: 2015-05-11 19:01:03
I agree, but I think it's important to look at every factor involved as well. Perhaps there will be a solution that *doesn't* demand us to change the block limit size in the future. If such a solution is available and works, why would we not use it instead of doing another hard fork? I think it would make sense.

I want to run a full node but I didn't know how to easily do it. Even though it's not *that* difficult to set up, I think it may be a challenge for some people. If it was made brain-dead simple (not having to modify ports and such) then probably more people would do it. Like, just double-click on the full-node program and it runs, with *no other* actions required. It needs to be that simple.
After that, it's mainly just the bandwidth factor that is the concern for me. 
User BTCenlightened helped me with what to do to get set up, by posting this link:

It's updating really fast now. Almost done! I plan to leave this node active for many years so your assistance has been of value.

It's not a personal attack. It's just a stress test of the system.
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:56:00
[Perhaps this is why](
So for all intents and purposes, it basically is 750kb/block size and not 1mb. I bet 99% of miners don't increase it to 1mb and just leave it at the default 750kb value
But I still am not quite sure why the backlog isn't clearing out per this top graph (see the blue line): 
Is it because the network can't clear transactions out faster than they are being added?
It looks like that spam attack was effective in backlogging transactions quite a bit actually.
@_date: 2015-05-10 17:06:03
Yes, I considered it. The HD light is not on all the time. It's basically flickering like 10-50% of the time at most, and not on full-blast. But it probably is contributing to the slowness factor.
I am thinking it probably just is the combination of all the slow hardware (between the slow cpu, slow hd and slow/little memory).
I just caught the CPU being maxed out for about 20 seconds. Now it's back to 2-5% usage, which is what it mostly is at.
I created a screenshot to show as much system specs as I could cram in: 
Now my question is: if I let this node finish synchronizing the entire blockchain (how ever many weeks that takes), will this node be helpful to the network? Or would it be better to have a more powerful node? I have several computers (all of which are more powerful than this netbook). I just chose this little Acer netbook because I wanted to keep power consumption down. But I want this node to be effectual and not a waste. What's your opinion? Once it's synchronized, will it be fine?
@_date: 2015-05-18 04:50:27

Those who dump or threaten to dump will be the minority, and sure, it will probably cause a *temporary* dip out of pure fear. But as with all fearful news, bitcoin price will rise above this dip quickly. And then we won't have those guys to worry about any more because they sold out! Ahh, a breath of fresh air.

[On May 29-30, 2015, a group of reddit members decided to do a transaction flood test of the bitcoin network.]( It was supposed to only last for 1 hour. The image in this post is taken from [statoshi.com]( It took about 8 hours to clear out the backlog of transactions. 
This is intended to raise awareness about our system. What if this attack was maintained for more than a few hours?
Could the bitcoin network be flooded into unusability by simply maintaining this type of spam attack for a longer period of time?
As [this reddit user stated](


Forget 51% attacks. Flooding the network is far cheaper. We need protection against the ability to do this.
Serious question and concern.

With Litecoin and Dogecoin you have dogecoins and litecoins instead of bitcoins. And you have a *dogecoin blockchain* and *litecoin blockchain* instead of a bitcoin blockchain. Otherwise, it's an identical setup.
You are correct, there are many blockchains out there. The point is, you can't separate the currency unit from its respective blockchain.

I think we will see solutions being developed to handle this issue and we will see them unfold over the next 1-2 years.

I agree with Mining_at_Work's concern, but taking it one step further. Let's say that spammers intentionally and continually increased the size of the blocks submitted, so as to ramp-up the average block sizes, intentionally over the same N-period of blocks, just as used in the calculation:


Then once the block size was sufficiently *too*-high, it could become a sort of attack on the network, by overloading the network with blocks that are *too big* for today's common internet connections to handle every 10 minutes (40mb blocks, 100mb blocks, or whatever size turns out to be too big).
In this scenario, no one would have enough bandwidth to propagate them every 10 minutes and it would grind the network to a standstill. Kind of like a DDoS of too-large blocks that no nodes can keep up with?
That's the only argument I can think of against having a dynamically scaling block-size algorithm. It could be manipulated intentionally.
Otherwise I think your solution is brilliant. If my concern is not actually possible then I say go for it.
With Gavin's proposal, the above is impossible. And then we could wait until other solutions have time to mature, such as the Lightning Network or side chain solutions, etc.

@_date: 2015-05-11 18:22:04
Great video actually. It really gets you playing devil's advocate and thinking about both sides of issue regarding number of transactions.
Without being very informed it's easy to blindly and simply say that changing to a 20mb block size is the best thing to do. And while that still may be necessary (purely due to time constraints and no other solutions available today), what I got from this video is that IF IT IS POSSIBLE to solve the problem of the number of transactions with ANY other solution, then that other solution is BETTER than resorting to modifying the bitcoin core protocol.
Because if we go to modify bitcoin core protocol once, then it opens the doors to changing it again, and again. And why change it again and again when we could implement OTHER solutions which solve the problem outright, AND keep the bitcoin core unchanged. If it's possible to solve the issue without changing the bitcoin core protocol, then that would seem to be the ideal solution.

@_date: 2015-05-04 01:45:51
I agree completely.
So, basically, there will eventually be *so many* transactions that these cumulative fee micropayments will add up to a considerable amount-- an amount that would not be possible with the number of transactions only allowable in a limited 1mb block size. I can jive with that.
Limiting the number of transactions as a "solution" has foolishness written all over it for many reasons.

It's not possible. It's a misconception that "you can use the blockchain without bitcoin". See:
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:30:08
I say just release the updated version with an increased block size, and see how many people update it.
It's a voluntary choice to update. That's the vote.
There will always be someone in opposition, and someone for it. Majority voice (by node adoption) will be the result that goes into effect. So a lot of debate isn't required really. Just release the new version, and let the people decide what to run.
I have a feeling from the general comments that I've seen on all bitcoin channels that the majority will adopt the larger blocks. But if it isn't adopted, well then that is what the majority wanted.
So the sooner you release it so people can decide with their **vote** by running it, the better.

As long as there is funding for it. But it doesn't seem to be that expensive if a small group of Redditers can pull it off.


Correct. Which is why if it were to be done as an attack, it would be continuous and without ceasing until the desired effect was caused. The cost would obviously be mathematically figured out by the attacker before begun.
Also, obviously, this kind of attack would devalue the very network they are attacking so the attacker would most likely not be someone within the bitcoin network, nor someone who had a lot of money to lose in bitcoin. It would likely be someone with vested interestes in destroying the network, like a competitor (SWIFT, Credit Card companies, PayPal, Federal Reserve, etc)
I'm speaking hypothetically of course, but I like to look at things from all angles.

Ironically this is exactly what Benjamin Lawsky is doing.
In Lawsky's case, he's setting up **regulations** so that he can charge for helping people get regulated with his new digital regulation company (which he's working at immediately following the completion of his BitLicense).
In Blockstream's case, (if it's true) it would be almost identical, because they would be **limiting the block size** so that they can get *their technology adopted* with greater ease.
Looks like everyone wants to profit from Bitcoin in any way they can.
Scams abound in the Bitcoin world. Some more obvious than others.
If the OP is correct, then my hat is off for having the intelligence to spot it.

Yes, it is using low end hardware.
But I didn't think this could be the reason because every time I have checked task manager to see the cpu utilization and the bandwidth utilization, they are like 1-10% each. It doesn't appear that the hardware is being overstressed. Wouldn't this be the case if it was maxing out?
I wanted to use low power consumption, so I put it on an a little Acer atom netbook. It's a 1.6ghz atom processor. The processor is slow as hell lol. But it's not maxed out or even close! It's 2gb memory and a 160gb unused harddrive (another reason why I chose it).
I have DSL which is 1200kb downstream and 140kb upstream. But bitcoin core is only using like 40-60kb/sec down, and only about 5kb/sec up.

Also, just FYI, the reason the price in Nov 2013 was 6x higher was because of Mark Karpeles' market manipulation bots (Willy) jacking the price up. It was a false high, assisted by bots. Sure there was China money entering, but they were trying to ride the Willy wave. We've been correcting ever since. It would never have been that high.

By that time (and long before it), nobody is going to be willing to pay $6 per transaction. At that point it's way more than any other payment network including PayPal and Credit Cards. Even by $1 per transaction I think bitcoin's benefits for transactions are pretty much gone. Credit cards charge $0.30 per transaction +2-3%. So $6 is wayyy above that.

It's based on time, not percentage of adoption. Yes, majority has to adopt for it to work at all, but it still won't go into effect until, say March 1st, 2016, for example.
Even if by next weekend we had 90% adoption, if the code states the fork activates on March 1, 2016, then that's when it starts and we have to wait until then despite having majority adoption sooner.
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:04:39
I think we were saying different things. Yes, of course it is very true that there are many blockchains out there. That goes without saying (or at least I thought it did).

Upon further research...
Upon first hearing about it, I was quite concerned about the DoS patch in Bitcoin XT. I had actually begun writing a big post to Mike addressing the issue. But I found this post and it has dramatically calmed me down about the patch:
The key part is highlighted in yellow, but I suggest reading the entire thing because it explains why and how it came to be. It makes a lot more sense.
A node has a maximum number of 125 incoming connections. These would only typically be all full if a DoS attack was occuring. The DoS patch ONLY becomes active when all 125 incoming connections are full. Otherwise it does nothing. So in ordinary circumstances when no attack is occuring, the patch doesn't even run at all.
You can disable this feature if you really want to, by using the flag: -disableipprio
**TL/DR:** There's a lot of FUD being spread to try to discredit Bitcoin XT. Do your research, starting with the above link
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:54:26
Yes that's true. The only votes that matter are those that actually would be using software that can support 8mb blocks, which is Bitcoin XT.
So, I need to find out how to determine specifically which blocks that were mined with Bitcoin XT.
Any idea?

I'm sorry but that's not how it's going to work. This fantasy world of selling coins on either side of "two forks" at various exchanges is not going to happen. It would be financially idiotic to be on the losing side of a fork, so no exchange will do it. They will all convert once majority consensus has been reached on any given piece of software (i.e. BIP101 or BIP100).
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:04:35

Everyone and their mother has a different idea on what is the right solution. At the end of the day you have to pick something that has some degree of consensus otherwise there are 1 million solutions and no clear winner. You don't have to side with one of the main solutions, but you will be alone on your idea unless you get others to follow it. So I'm following BIP 101 because it has a chance to win and it's better than no increase. BIP 100 isn't as good in my opinion, and you are free to disagree.

Maaku's response doesn't make any sense. There is no "hostile attack". He only perceives Bitcoin XT this way because he obviously does not agree with it.
If a majority of people adopt XT then Maaku is in the minority. If he feels like this is an attack, then that's his view-- but really he just was on the smaller side of a purely voluntary vote. And that's all.
This is another example of a word-slinging-match, using harsh wording to try to force no change from happening.

Would it really be that difficult though? Because Bitcoin XT 0.11A mines blocks with a specific version number. So if I find any block with that version number then that tells me what software it was most likely mined with. That would be fine for my purposes.


XT 0.11A does include blocksize adjustment code.

@_date: 2015-07-03 02:06:32
Can someone compile and release it please?
A lot of us are tired of waiting and want to move forward. If a majority of blocks end up being created by that version of the software, then a fork will occur. If a majority doesn't occur, then the fork doesn't occur. I'm ok with either way because it's what the majority wants. But if the software never sees the light of day, then there is no chance for change. I would compile and release it myself if I knew how.
This isn't intended to incite a big debate or arguments. Some of us just want a copy of the software to run to have a *chance* to have bigger blocks.

At the end of the t0 release event, Patrick Byrne said **they *have* selected a blockchain to use, but they aren't announcing which one yet**. He also said t0 is "blockchain agnostic" which he explained means that it can use ANY blockchain, be it Bitcoin or Counterparty or Ripple or ~~Coinbase~~ Circle (I think that last one was a slip of the tongue. And I really hope Ripple was a joke.)
Note: I did notice earlier in the event Patrick said they did a practice settlement with their first company, and they did it on the **Bitcoin** blockchain. He specifically said the word "Bitcoin" there.

This is what I got from the comic:
**The Tower** = A country's total debt (brought about by banks and fractional reserve banking)
**Taking off pieces of people's houses to support the "tower"** = Bail in (taking the peoples' money to solve the debt)
**Making the tower twice as tall at the end** = People foolishly repeating their mistakes which will lead to the next great collapse of the "tower" (the financial crisis we're now in)
So I guess Bitcoiners would be the people living below who do NOT contribute parts of their houses to support the growing "tower" of debt and financial irresponsibility.

Upon first hearing about it, I was quite concerned about the DoS patch in Bitcoin XT. I had actually begun writing a big post to Mike addressing the issue. But I found this post and it has dramatically calmed me down about the patch:
The key part is highlighted in yellow, but I suggest reading the entire thing because it explains why and how it came to be. It makes a lot more sense.
A node has a maximum number of 125 incoming connections. These would only typically be all full if a DoS attack was occuring. The DoS patch ONLY becomes active when all 125 incoming connections are full. Otherwise it does nothing. So in ordinary circumstances when no attack is occuring, the patch doesn't even run at all.
You can disable this feature if you really want to, by using the flag: -disableipprio
**TL/DR:** There's a lot of FUD being spread to try to discredit Bitcoin XT. Do your research, starting with the above link

Hmm thanks for that. It seems there is not a standardized way to represent the vote.
I think what I'm looking for is more specific actually. Because the only votes that matter (for my intents) are those that actually would be using software that can support 8mb blocks, which is Bitcoin XT.
So, I need to find out how to see specifically the blocks that *Bitcoin XT* mines.
I am looking through blocktrail.com's API but I cannot find a way to report the 'version' number for each block. Am I missing it? And would this do the trick?
Bitcoin XT blocks have a version number of "536870919" (which is == 0x20000007)

Ok, I understand you will not compile the 0.11 version, and you will just compile the 0.11A version.
I want to make available the 0.11 though so we get as much adoption of the blocksize increase code as possible. It is only in our best interests to do that, and not make it difficult for people. So I acknowledge you personally won't be compiling it. Thanks for making it available though.

@_date: 2015-07-02 17:43:36
Because the "real data" you are referring to (past 100 blocks) is too small of a sample size. The actual average is 10 minutes. Sure there will be short-term decreases in block times due to increased hash power, but there will also be increases as well. Using a small subset of blocks to determine an average is unnecessary because the algorithm already tells you how fast blocks are solved on average. 10 minutes. Anything else is looking at too small of a picture.

You are correct that simply communicating the desire for increased blocks does not actually change anything, nor does it guarantee anything.
However, all blocks mined with Bitcoin XT will have version 536870919 (0x20000007), instead of 3. Therefore it does make sense to track these blocks because they are run using software that does incorporate an increased block size. It's not just wishful thinking in this case.

Yeah I was wondering if anything in 0.11 addresses the Tx spam issues we are currently facing?
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:03:25


    Bitcoin XT 0.11A will have both the increased max blocksize code as well as Mike's other few small updates
    which are already present in Bitcoin XT. Mike will release the compiled binaries for this version.
    Mike will also put together the source code for a version (0.11 without the "A") which will ONLY have the
    increased max blocksize code addition, and will NOT contain Mike's other few small updates. That version
    will basically be Bitcoin Core 0.11 + the blocksize increase code. Mike will not compile this version.


Bitcoin XT was adopted by many by the basic vote of confidence for what Mike and Gavin are proposing. The number of nodes went UP upon the news of a *future* blocksize increase, even though it had not yet been implemented. This was the initial upsurge of XT adoption from 30 nodes to 130~.


What are you talking about, "Active price trading on XT with those bigger blocks"? I do not follow at all. I don't think that has anything to do with what I am talking about.
To reiterate: the recent drop in XT nodes is EXACTLY timed with the release of Bitcoin Core 0.11, of which there (to date) is no corresponding version Bitcoin XT 0.11. That relationship is very exactly linked.

Correct. That's what I'm saying. If that's what you're saying then we are saying the same thing.
Unless of course Bitcoin Core then goes ahead and adds the blocksize increase code to it as well. Then people will go back, which I think could eventually happen, or Bitcoin Core would become irrelevant. And they won't let that happen.

You should get in the loop.
There is a major non-consensus among lead developers which is fracturing the dev-space of Bitcoin (stagnating it and allowing no change to go through), and which is likely strongly influenced by ulterior motives of blockstream members who also hold a seat in the Bitcoin Core github submission. AKA major conflict of interest. Bitcoin XT side-steps all these blockstream members with conflicts of interest and gives people a chance to actually bring about a change in the block size, because it's not happening otherwise.

Of course no blocks are going to be regularly larger than 1mb for a little while to come.
The entire point is to be ready *before* then. Software has to be running before a particular date so that a saturation of the software (and mined blocks with the new version) has a chance to occur.

Bitcoin is an alternative to fiat, and the world's biggest stock exchange which deals with fiat is down. Re-look at this from a big perspective. It totally has to do with Bitcoin. Could bitcoin go offline? Not unless the entire Internet in all countries went down simultaneously.

That's completely not the point I was taking up.
I was talking about the censorship.
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:36:32
The dumb thing is, if a hard fork is "prohibited" (I think you meant "undesired"/"unpopular") then it won't be adopted. So it is a self-solving problem.
Conversely, if there ever comes to be a bitcoin hard fork that IS desired by everyone, then it will be used. And that will be an "altcoin" just the same. The only difference is that everyone will be in favor of it, so no one will actually call it an "altcoin". They will just call it "Bitcoin".
No *undesired* hard-fork will get adopted by majority into use.
So it's just a name-slinging match. Similar to calling someone the n-word, or kids calling each other names on the playground. It's just meant to be derogatory.
@_date: 2015-08-24 22:08:12




I don't understand that logic. I see it in the reverse: if, as you said, we are essentially *guaranteed* with having to do a hard fork, then at least *attempt* a solution that has a *chance* of handling future traffic volume, rather than *guaranteeing* another hard fork (by providing no ability for future growth whatsoever).
Another hard fork may be next to impossible with the saturation of bitcoin clients and nodes in hardware and software. We must not forget the ever increasing difficulty of pulling off a hard fork as time goes on. This isn't something where we can take our sweet time expecting to do hard forks every 2 years. That is both a failure to plan and foolish.

Fortunately, Bitcoin is a new hope which can empower individuals from this kind of thing. They just have to be wise enough to use it.

However, in all fairness, the link text "Support your favourite wallet" should be renamed to "bump your favorite wallet's position" or something less ambiguous. As long as you know you're bumping a wallet position and not donating to the wallet developers themselves, then no harm done.
"Support your favourite wallet" *is* ambiguous.

@_date: 2015-07-30 02:25:17
Don't think I'm tracking with you. And why are you attacking me?
The pool that validates a given block can put the vote (if it's using Bitcoin XT) into that block version. So if more hashpower is pointed at pools which are running Bitcoin XT 0.11A, then more blocks will be mined with that version number, and thus adoption can occur.

I don't think it's going to happen like that. This has been elaborated on before, but I don't know the links.
From what I remember it was explained something like this: If XT turns out to be the winning fork, adoption will change over quickly to it because no one wants to be on the losing side of a fork. That would be stupid and a loss of money for whoever did so. There will be only 1 main chain.
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:36:33
Yes, *an* altcoin (two in this case, feathercoin and litecoin), but not the *same* altcoin. Let's leave the conversation at this. I feel like I want to hit myself in the face with a frying pan at how ridiculous this is.
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:08:22
Yes they could. But that's always possible, so that's a constant-- not a variable. Thus, if there's an increase in velocity then that indicates *possibility* of an increase in usage (but obviously not a guarantee for the reason you mentioned-- maybe the manipulation increased too-- it's always possible).
Again, it's just a statistic (and certainly not the best one) and can be taken with a grain of salt.

I've been running my bitcoin node with the OP's settings for 24 hours and am happy to report drastically reduced mempool usage. It was 50MB before with tens of thousands of transactions, and now it's 1.5MB with only about 1,500 transactions. It has filtered out all the dust.

This is great, Mike. Are you able to give us an approximate date when 0.11 and 0.11A will be released?
I have updated [XTnodes.com](
edit: While I know you personally wont be compiling the v0.11 code (blocksize code only), I will be happy to host the binaries for the it on [XTnodes.com]( when the code becomes available.
For those confused:
    Bitcoin XT 0.11A will have both the increased max blocksize code as well as Mike's other few small updates
    which are already present in Bitcoin XT. Mike will release the compiled binaries for this version.
    Mike will also put together the source code for a version (0.11 without the "A") which will ONLY have the
    increased max blocksize code addition, and will NOT contain Mike's other few small updates. That version
    will basically be Bitcoin Core 0.11 + the blocksize increase code. Mike will not compile this version.
For the note, personally I am fine running Mike's Bitcoin XT 0.11A

I have the same "problem". I've never been able to *stop* accumulating them. Something about their truly limited supply makes them feel like actual value that I don't want to miss out on while they're still such a good price compared to what they can become. Only so many people in the world are going to be able to say they own 1 btc in the future, let alone 21 or 50 or 100. If you own 100 bitcoins you are the top 0.003 % or something insane like that.
    100 bicoins = There are only 210,000 people who could ever have that many.
    210,000 people is 0.003% of 7 billion people. Talk about a transfer of wealth to the new wealthy elite.
    21 bicoins = There are only 1,000,000 people who could ever have that many.

What does "Yes" and "No" refer to?
edit: nevermind, it's answered in the article.
If it votes "**Yes**", it must continue to repay the crushing debt load to the IMF that has crippled the country's economy over the last few years. But the country does get to stay in the EU and keep the euro as its currency.
If it votes "**No**",  then Greece will likely *default on almost all its remaining debt, maybe exit the EU, abandon the euro and re-adopt its old currency, the drachma*. That would plunge Greece into even more economic turmoil as it would become an international pariah, largely cut off from the credit markets countries need to finance themselves.

Yeah I think that is a bad move too. Both versions should be compiled imo. I understand Mike wants to keep his changes intact and doesn't want to maintain two versions of the software, but right now the blocksize increase is the biggest change by far and it should be easily made available to the public in all forms desired. Otherwise we just hurt adoption, and that hurts both versions really.

Another thing I realized is that if Bitcoin is strangled at the very low 1mb block level and the vast bulk of network traffic is pushed to other layers (such as Lightning Network), then effectively control over Bitcoin is owned by those who own LN. It's a way of taking power.
I think LN should exist, but in *addition* to Bitcoin's own scaling-- not *instead* of it.

There's nothing wrong with a vote to bump your wallet system.
I think OP's issue boils down to the fact that the link text "Support your favourite wallet" should probably be renamed to "bump your favorite wallet's position" or something less ambiguous. As long as you know you're bumping a wallet position and not donating to the wallet developers themselves, then no harm done.
"Support your favourite wallet" *is* ambiguous.

The answer to your question is: Miners can decide what size blocks they want to mine, in exactly the same was as many current miners are only mining 730kb blocks instead of the actual max blocksize of 1mb. So if the max blocksize was 8mb, what's to stop them from setting their limit at 2mb or 4mb? They can protect themselves quite easily. They *already* have the power to do so.
But again, you should (and do) already know this. So I fail to see why you bring that up as an argument, and again, I feel you are trying to find a logical-sounding argument (yet false) to cover up the fact that:
**The bigger the max blocksize, the longer it makes Blockstream irrelevant.**
1.) Miners have control over the size blocks they make.
2.) And on the converse, if blocks *do not* get filled to their limit, and instead grow naturally in size, then we have a network that can grow. (Additional side notes: It also costs more to spam attack a larger block size.  And with upcoming proposed spam protection in the form of a different fee structure to protect from such a thing, this will also help prevent blocks from just getting filled with junk.)
It's a win-win situation.
What is your reply to all of this? I am totally willing to meet in agreement if it shows logic that works.
And as a sidenote: I am totally thrilled by the idea of LN and sidechains. Just so you know.

Adam, you are using the word "jumps" a bit to serve your own ends here, because we are talking about a *maximum cap*. The blocks do not "jump" in size. But of course you know that. So I can only assume you intended to use it in such a way.
I suppose if the blocksize limit is very large, then there will not be a need for other solutions in the short term. In fact, the larger the max blocksize limit, the longer it will take for things like sidechains and lightning to be needed. It seems a direct correlation. The bigger the blocksize limit, the more you wouldn't like it for that reason. It makes your (Blockstream's) services less and less needed.
But that's the wrong motivation, so I feel when you refer to a blocksize increase in a negative fashion, you are speaking out of this regard because of your company's own vested interests.
My observation: **The bigger the max blocksize, the longer it makes Blockstream irrelevant.** And that's bad for investor money.
Would you really deny this?

There won't be two coins. Whatever version is majority will be adopted by all exchanges and miners. As soon as you found yourself on the smaller adoption side, you would change and use the code that everyone else is using or you'd become obsolete.

Because some people don't want to be forced to update other code changes (however minor or slight they may be) just to get the block-size increase version. I understand with this point of view and I agree. The increased max blocksize should be the *only* change made in that particular version. I think Mike disagrees with making two versions, but I'm glad he has decided to release a 0.11 code with *just* the blocksize increase. This will make a lot of people happy. He is making a good move there.
**What he may be overlooking is this:**
When a bunch of people have adopted the 0.11 code (with *only* the blocksize increase), things will be fine until a newer version of regular Bitcoin Core comes out, say a future version 0.12. At that point, some people will jump ship from Bitcoin XT and go back to the regular version of Bitcoin Core simply because it's a newer version. And then we'd lose those particular blocksize increase supporters who were running the code in 0.11 which had the blocksize changes.
Evidence of this is by the fact that when 0.11 of Bitcoin Core recently came out, a significant drop in the number of XT users can be seen on [XTnodes.com]( because no equivalent version was available at the same time in XT flavor. This would repeat.
The moral of the story is: until the max block-size actually goes into effect, it would behoove Mike and Gavin to keep up with the new versions of Bitcoin Core immediately upon each release, so that users can upgrade and STAY on the blocksize increase path, even if they aren't using XT 0.11A and are only using the regulat 0.11 with the blocksize increase code.
Each time a new version of Bitcoin Core comes out, the longer the delay in releasing an equivalent XT version, the more lost users (again as witness by the graph). And we don't want that when it comes to votes.

Agreed. I understand Mike wants to keep his changes intact and doesn't want to maintain two versions of the software, but right now the blocksize increase is the biggest change by far (importance-wise) and it should be made easily available to the public in all forms desired. Otherwise we just hurt adoption of the blocksize increase in general.

Mike's post actually makes me think of one question:
**Who are the venture capital funders paying for Blockstream development?** Money speaks powerfully.
The agenda that Blockstream employees is pushing is likely a direct agenda from the venture capitalists funding them. "Do this or we'll cut funding" or "Do this and we'll give you $1 million". It would be interesting to know who they are. Perhaps it will take us a little deeper toward the truth of what's happening here.

Honestly, I feel there is a chance we could be too late if a spike surge occurs. The number of transactions can increase incredibly and within a very short period of time. I would much rather be getting a start on it than "hope we are ok until a year from now".
What if in 2 months we see a price surge to $1000 or $2000? (perhaps due to what is happening with Greece/Europeon countries for example. That's a hypothetical and plausible circumstance. It's also been a very long time since our last price surge and the chances of another one happening soon are very great.)

Jeff is right.
**Presently, there is a state of major non-consensus among lead developers which is fracturing the dev-space of Bitcoin** (stagnating it and allowing no change to go through, specifically with increasing the maximum blocksize), and which is likely strongly influenced by ulterior motives of Blockstream members who also hold a number of seats in the Bitcoin Core github submission.
AKA **major** conflict of interest.
Bitcoin XT v0.11A will side-step all these Blockstream members' conflicts of interest and give people a chance to actually bring about a change in the block size, because it's not happening otherwise.
There's too much muddy water with Blockstream members also being a part of Bitcoin Core. In my opinion they need to pick one side or the other. It's not fair to have them in both camps at the same time. It's fine if they want to be a member of Blockstream. But they should no longer be a part of Bitcoin Core development then, because their interests are swayed by their Blockstream affiliation.

The total cost of mining will typically grow until it is close to the value of the coins being mined.

8% is a good discount, especially if you can count on it every time. Why would someone pay 8% more if they knew they didn't have to?
Imagine if you could instantly buy bitcoin on Purse.io as well (like you can do on Coinbase.com), without going to another site, and then purchase stuff from Amazon.com for 8% off, every time. That would make it so user friendly and simple, almost everyone would do it.
That could be a major widespread application if it was *truly easy to use* (made as simple as possible to a normal check-out procedure on Amazon-- take some of the steps out of it, like having to buy bitcoin at another site).

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. This is the "fee" they charge you when you borrow any money.
Line of Credit is a type of loan basically. I get a lower APR fee (12%) on the line of credit than on the credit card (18%). The line of credit looks like a regular bank account when I log in, and I can transfer money from it just as with any other account, but it's actually debt instead of money. It starts accruing interest immediately. But it's worth it to use it first (instead of the credit card) since it has a lower APR.
@_date: 2015-04-25 04:55:35
Yes, this is *exactly* the same situation as me. I see it's not just me.
So funny that you can just workaround it that easily but they will bother declining it as a direct payment from the line of credit to the credit card.

Yeah, it's like a permanent hole in the bitcoin economy that can't be plugged. Continual downward pressure due to constant selling of bitcoins to pay mining and electricity costs.

They speak of the blockchain as if it is a separate entity from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:54:38


But if the bitcoin network could be maintained for much less than what is currently being spent, then this wouldn't be allowed very far because the incentive would be there to mine those bitcoins and sell them. It seems there is a circular loop in which the bitcoin price and hashrate are roughly dependant on eachother both ways.
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:45:33
**Note:** I did *not* make any bitcoin-related purchases with this credit card, in case that's what you were wondering first.
I woke up this morning and Wells Fargo bank had decided to restrict one of my credit cards. I had no idea why. It was fully paid off.
I had to call in, give them my name, address credit card number, expiration date and code on the back. Also they had to verify certain charges were truly mine.
Then I was told that I could not use my line of credit to pay off this credit card and this was why it was restricted. And the woman told me that if I did it again the credit card could be terminated.
My line of credit has lower APR so that's why I did it.
I asked if I had transferred the money from my line of credit into my bank account first and *then* paid off the credit card that way, would that set off the same red flag? And she said "we can't tell you what you can do with the money in your checking account".
So basically I have to be careful how I juggle my money around.
I told her I was not happy with all the controls put on how I handle my money. All I could think about was how I wish I could be completely separated from banks and just use bitcoin. I really don't like people telling me how to handle money. It's overbearing and over-controlling.
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:42:05
Gah, I am so confused. You're probably right-- I just can't see it.

@_date: 2015-04-28 03:49:19
Yes, but the *incentive* is there for more people to mine the bitcoins if the difficulty drops but the price remains the same. This prevents the difficulty from being allowed to drop too far below market value per bitcoin by the fact that everyone would start mining to take advantage of this "arbitrage" factor (bitcoin vs electricity costs to mine the bitcoin)... so I feel like they will always be interconnected, won't they?

@_date: 2015-04-28 18:14:58
True. So it's not the network's electricity costs that determines the price of bitcoin, it's the cost of bitcoin that determines how much electricity cost there will be, right?
I guess it's the money flying out the window to pay for these large electricity costs that has me concerned.

It was just surprising to be told what I couldn't do with money.
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:59:26
Yes that's correct. All that hash-power costs electricity. A lot of it!
I think what I am saying is just that it seems like it is going to be costing a shit-ton of electricity that is getting burned up, and how can this much energy cost be sustainable?
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:36:28
True, the electricity cost is more directly related to hashing capacity than to bitcoin price. But they do follow somewhat don't they?
For example: When the bitcoin price sustains at a new higher range, the difficulty adjusts higher, and more hashing power is thrown at the network which uses more electricity.
So for all intents and purposes, doesn't the cost of hashing seem to follow the price of bitcoin in a rough sense?
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:19:58


Yes! You get me.
**The wastefulness of all the *money* spent on electricity used to maintain the network.**
That sums it up well. 
It's not even the electricity that I care about. It's the money gone to pay for it. That money just disappears and goes back into the fiat economy.
Maybe some day electricity sources will accept bitcoin for payment and we can close the loop? :P
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:23:17
Yes, that's right.
The thing that has me concerned is the sheer amount of money flying out the window to pay for these large electricity/mining costs.
*The money continually leaves the bitcoin ecosystem when this happens.*
Is that something not to be concerned with?
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:38:58
And perhaps that is the answer. Maybe $1.3 billion or $13 billion anually really *isn't* that much in the grand scheme of things and is still worth it.
Perhaps I am just not used to such large electrical cost figures, and it will just become the norm for operating the decentralized bitcoin network and will be worth it.

Don't know where you got those numbers from. BIP101 *is* activated by 75%. Not 95%.
I think you may have meant BIP100? Because BIP100 keeps changing, and it needs a higher percentage to activate.
@_date: 2015-09-03 17:33:37
1) Yes. I like that very much. 
2) Yes. Look what a dysfunctional mess the current bitcoin core team is.  Not to mention bought-out.
3) Yes, but you have not included the most important fact that the tor de-prioritizing only occurs when a node is fully saturated with 125 connections,  and  that would only happen it were under attack.
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:12:05
Interesting. That may be what I'm looking for-- comparative figures for actual banking costs.
If 1.3 billion is a drop in the bucket then maybe it's not a big deal that these costs are being paid out in electricity for the security of the entire network.

@_date: 2015-09-23 03:20:27
Yeah, these devices aren't powerful enough to solve a block and so would have to be involved in pooled mining. The satoshis are supposed to flow in at a fairly regular rate to the device. Thus, some central 21 mining pool(s) will be funding the Bitcoin computers, and the Bitcoin's will not be "freshly minted" in any way. They will be distributed.

@_date: 2015-09-03 14:09:28
The key word is **sudden** doubling (as in a step up). You are correct it's an exponential function, but inbetween the steps are linear progressions. It's certainly not what I first envisioned. I imagined 8mb for 2 years and then it goes up.
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:13:08
Yes, all 3 are factors involved in this. In the long run though, there will always be the cost for electricity (more or less depending on difficulty and hardware efficiency). It's the money flying out the window to pay for these large electricity costs that has me concerned. The money leaves the bitcoin ecosystem when this happens.
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:19:26
Thanks, I'll check it out. This kind of analysis isn't necessarily ignored. In my case, I just never saw the information. There will always be new people that have the same questions as those who have answered them long since. It's part of the education game for bitcoin.

Yes, there is a lot of misinformation and in some instances it is spread intentionally so that really creates a confusing scene. I agree compeltely about this:


I have done that for myself and come to my own conclusions, as have you. Let's just hope we weren't fed incorrect information on which to base our decisions. I do my best to cut through the B.S. and see the truth. Others do that to varying degrees. Some, unfortunately, just take whatever is spoon-fed to them, and that's where you can get a problem.
One thing is certain though is that censorship in does not allow this free thinking process to begin with all the information. It is manipulatively controlled and guided to spread one (or a few) people's specific and personal beliefs. And that is not how it should be, and is wrong.
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:00:49

P.S. Yes, I also think it's funny how we are carrying on two conversations
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:33:23
Yes, the difficulty does adjust, but it still requires more power to mine the increased-difficulty network. And that costs more electricity.

either way, but usually a cash advance has extra fees so i've never found that worthwhile. usually i try to take advantage of a 0% APR balance transfer option. But they have 3% fees on the amount transferred, so the 0% offer has to be for long enough to be worth the 3% fee.

This is very true. That does make it seem better when put in comparison with the vast wastefulness of the legacy banking system.

That must *really* cost a lot of energy!
@_date: 2015-09-05 15:38:17
dumbdoggydummy: You have it reversed. The thing is, the rational bitcoiners among us DO want Lightning Network and Sidechains, but we ALSO want bigger blocks. And so while we are open for all 3 of the options above, there has effectively been a censorship and blockade of blocksize increase (by Theymos and Blockstream members who are also Core devs). So you see, I think your blame is targeted in the wrong direction.
Ideally we would have all 3 solutions  (Bigger blocks, LN **and** Sidechains). But some camps would only want to allow the latter two and stop all forward progress in regards to the blocksize solution with all manner of "reasonable" thinking as to why blocksize solutions put forth aren't suitable.
Anything can be stopped enough objections. That's where the problem lies. And to top it off there's censorship. So now take a look at which side is really irrational here. I think the offenders will be obvious to you.

Well said. I think you're right. The evolution will take some time to make a complete closed-loop solution where bitcoin and digital currencies are no longer cashed out for fiat. Until then, there will be baby steps in that direction. So it's our job to support those baby steps until they become giant steps. The small room of people who give a fuck about honest money will grow into oceans. It just takes time, but it's already happening I feel.

That is true, the efficiency of these hashing machines will improve as better mining technology is created. And this will lower the electrical costs of running them. But I think there is still always a cost of electricity. And so far the speed of the increase of the total network hash-rate has increased faster than the efficiency of the machines used to mine. So it would seem that the cost of running the network will only increase over time, and not decrease fast enough even with new technology.
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:55:06
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:51:51


True, but isn't this kind of like the chicken and the egg scenario? If the price goes up but the difficulty does not, then the incentive is there for more miners to approach the network (thus increasing the difficulty, and also the electricity costs). It seems like they will always be interrelated.
Is there really a realistic scenario where the bitcoin price could go up and the hash power does not follow?

So I guess the answer really is to hopefully close the loop and have the mining hardware companies and electricity companies accept bitcoin for payment (and keep it as bitcoin). Perhaps some day in the distant future. That appears to be the only way to prevent the constant selling of bitcoins with the technology designed as it is.

I think I see what you're saying there. Yes, perhaps all along the while, these bitcoin core devs were not on board with a block size increase. Maybe that was their viewpoint the entire time.
If so, then that eases the ill feelings toward Blockstream. However, it still leaves me disagreeing with the decisions of those devs for the future viability of Bitcoin on a massive scale. But that is my opinion of course and others may disagree and say that those core devs are doing an awesome job and are making the best decisions.


In reply to "how can I spin that as a negative interest?", well, just on the fees structure. For example, if Blockstream designs LN such that LN earns them money in fees *when it could simply have been* paid to miners who included those transactions in larger blocks, then we have a situation where Bitcoin could have had an enhanced protocol but was left limited for a company's private gain.
This analogy I just wrote explains what I am trying to say with a different example:


I think it just boils down to I don't want to see the core Bitcoin protocol crippled because of outside interests.

2.) Andreas' facial expression is utterly hilarious as Michael finishes asking the question.
3.) While the recording quality of the audience is fairly poor because the microphones are so far away, out of the entire hour long recording, this was by far the audience's loudest reaction to *anything*.
4.) I also found it amusing how quickly the two Blockstream employees (Matt &amp; Greg) speak up (almost talking over each other) to immediately defend this statement.
5.) For the record, you can hear Greg's full answer in the link provided. I personally found it like Greg was talking his way out of a legitimate accusation. I didn't get much substance from it.

But that is the thing. They aren't a completely separate from other projects. A considerable number of the individuals on the Bitcoin Core development team ARE the individuals hired by Blockstream. They are one in the same now.
But Blockstream's goal is to provide the solution that a blocksize increase would bring. So there is a big conflict of interest for that reason.

 Ironically, Bitcoin, a decentralized network, had the Achilles' heel of centralized *communication*, controlled by one entity (Theymos in this case). This allowed it to be taken over, and censored. It seems, in retrospect, that to successfully run a decentralized network such as Bitcoin, the additional ingredient required is a decentralized **communication network**, from the start. It was a hidden point of attack all along, waiting to be exploited.

Yes but that point wasn't the main point of the question. Greg sort of side-stepped the main point Michael is attempting to bring up and diverts the conversation onto the differences to Linux. 
Michael's point is that the *endless debate* and wasted time is resulting in not achieving a direction.
The entire point of the question is that we are not getting anywhere. In response to that, Greg just says, "that's not necessarily clear to me."

I thought you and I had a good conversation a little while back, and here you are resorting to insults like "whining". I'm disappointed.
As for the rest of your post, if Bitcoin remains with 1mb blocks, then the only way a large population can use Bitcoin for cash purchases is by trusting a 3rd party service to aggregate and settle large numbers of transactions due to the limited block space. At that time it will not cost 3 pennies to do a bitcoin transaction directly on the main bitcoin blockchain.

Yes, but also keep in mind that the layer 2 system could be more centralized than bitcoin. A layer 2 system could be attacked potentially with greater ease and less resources than simply attacking Bitcoin. So which one really has more centralization?
The point being, we are both arguing points that are hypothetical. Which one really is more secure? Which one has the best trade-off?
Let's hope that someone's (or some company's) personal gain isn't the *maker* of that decision, but rather, the decision is made based on what is in the best interest for *Bitcoin* as a whole.

@_date: 2015-11-12 13:46:27
First of all, thanks for your reply in a rational manner.


This logic doesn't work though. You are saying that just because someone was previously employed in a group that they *cannot* be bought out at a later date and have their motives changed by financial incentives. This is not true. People can be bought out at any time.
So in the case of Blockstream, they swooped in and bought up these core devs with a lot of venture capital money. Blockstream wants something in return for their investment. Return on their investment. And how will something such as LN return on their investment? By a fee structure and by people *needing* this solution. Why would people *need* LN as a solution? Well, for one thing if there isn't enough space in blocks for regular transactions, then they would need to be moved off main chain. This then becomes a conflict of interest in Bitcoin's growth.


Mike was referring to the lack of ability to process a high volume of transactions. Poorly = low block size and low transaction quantity. It could also mean speed of transaction. As an example, if the debate was centered around increasing the block times from 10 minutes to 20 seconds, Blockstream would likely be against this as well, since they propose to create instant transactions. Again, an example of conflict of interest in the basic Bitcoin protocol.
I just thought of another good example to highlight my point:
Let's say that a technology was developed to erase the trail of transaction history, while still being able to fully validate the total number of coins. This would enable full privacy for all users. This would be a great feature. Now, let's say that we COULD implement this feature into Bitcoin Core, or it COULD be added it as a layer 2 feature. A company that has a lot of money could employ existing Bitcoin developers NOT to upgrade Bitcoin Core and instead spend their time adding this feature to the layer 2 add-on, because the layer 2 addon would be an opportunity to create extra income for the company by charging some fees for the service. This is another example of a conflict of interest. As far as regular bitcoin users are concerned, it would be best if the feature was just added into the core software. If it could be, and wasn't, then we have a good example of individuals getting corrupted to leave Bitcoin less feature rich because they got paid to do so.


See my first paragraph above. It seems like you feel because of these individuals' *past histories* in Bitcoin, that they are infallible, and that they could never succumb to financial incentives to betray their visions. If there's one thing the subject of "money" has shown is that man has proven he is not trustworthy of controlling money. He will abuse it and is corruptable. I am definitely not saying that EVERY individual will succumb to financial incentives to become corrupt, but SOME will.

Eventually users will not even know they're using bitcoin, and yet will be protected by layers which have designed security into them to prevent this sort of thing happening. Early days, gentlemen.

If we have to fork again in the future we can do so. But at least now we have a *chance* of meeting the needs of growing adoption. Doing *nothing* leads us into certain trouble, so why not do something that solves the problem and has a *chance* to solve it for a while to come? Maybe it isn't a perfect prediction of the rate of increase. It would be truly impressive if it was somehow perfectly spot on. But maybe it will hold good for 5 years, or 10 years even. Or maybe we'll get really lucky and never actually have to fork it again. 
Miners don't *have* to mine blocks of any particular size. They can cap them at whatever they want. It's a MAX block size limit, but that doesn't mean miners can't go smaller. There is actually quite a lot of freedom.

Internet capabilities don't stand still over time. You are making an apples to oranges comparison. You would have to account for the increase in bandwidth as well if you're going to look in the future at bigger block sizes. The world doesn't freeze except for the increasing block size. Everything changes.

**1.) The question Michael Perklin asks is *beautifully* worded**. We should all be asking this question ourselves.
2.) Andreas' facial expression is utterly hilarious as Michael finishes asking the question.
3.) While the recording quality of the audience is fairly poor because the microphones are so far away, out of the entire hour long recording, this was by far the audience's loudest reaction to *anything*.
4.) I also found it amusing how quickly the two Blockstream employees (Matt &amp; Greg) speak up (almost talking over each other) to immediately defend this statement.
5.) For the record, you can hear Greg's full answer in the link provided. I personally found it like Greg was talking his way out of a legitimate accusation. I didn't get much substance from it. 
Additionally, if you listen to the full video (link below), in Greg's reply he talks about his only fear being **competing interests**. Hello? This is what Blockstream is.

**Note:** I'm not sure why I am getting down-voted. I am just trying to have a friendly conversation and increase my understanding of another's points of view.


^ Doesn't this also apply to the same framework which will deploy Lightning Networks? These will also have to meet those same requirements of resilient and lightweight in order to remain broadly run and thus able to thwart off attacks.


^ The only thing I don't understand is how is any considerable % of Earth's population supposed to have direct access to the blockchain with only a few transactions per second limit?
If we reached the monumental saturation rate of 1/10th of the world's population using the Bitcoin blockchain, then this would be very much more than the current number of transactions on the blockchain-- so much more, in fact, that it would not be reasonable for any individual to do even a single transaction per day. (Keep in mind I am not mocking or attacking your statements-- I am truly trying to understand how individuals would retain this right of direct blockchain access, when the blocks are so small that the sheer number of individuals attempting to access the blockchain would overload it.) Unless you mean to say that the user would have to pay a certain, considerably higher fee to have this privilege of having their transaction being included in one of these smaller blocks. I am guessing that is what you mean because I can see no other way. Feel free to correct me if this is not what you envisioned.
In that regard, bitcoin will then become like a clearing house, used to settle only high value transactions, with all personal transactions occurring off-chain. But this then seems to contradict your statement: *"I feel, is the liberty to run a full node and participate on the network in a purely peer-to-peer way is the most fundamental right a bona fide Bitcoin user should have."* because not everyone would access the main blockchain at that point. They would access side chains and layer 2 networks. That is, unless they were willing to pay whatever considerable fee it would be to be included directly in the main blockchain.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:52:14
I agree. If the price of BTC suddenly shot upward, buyers could use refunds in BTC to sway their decision to return something, to get more back than they paid. This would be losses for Rakuten.

You can't force people to use bitcoin technology how *you* want them to use it.
You must service the users with tools that allows *them* to use it how they want to. So, smarter software and tools are needed because people statistically (from the image) want to re-use addresses.

This would be more exciting if functionality of bitcoin wasn't stifled in order to be offered from a centralized entity (Blockstream).

Not at all! I 100% agree LN should exist. I love it and think it's a great idea. But it should not be done **in lieu of** a block size increase.
And the block size increase should definitely not be slowed or stopped by the hope and promise of the LN.
They should *both* be done.

@_date: 2015-11-12 15:25:40






That's an interesting point of view. Yes, perhaps then Blockstream was simply one of the shrewdest investors around because they saw the potential value of these core developers, and if Blockstream didn't put them on their team, then someone else would. So maybe it really doesn't matter in the end because it would happen the same way.


Except that Blockstream is a *business* model. Blockstream is not there as a non-profit organization. Blockstream is there to make money. So to say there is no financial motivation to their decision, I feel would be too innocent of a viewpoint. I think the aggregate fees *will* add up to something considerable, but you are correct I am theorizing and only time will tell.


Amen. I am grateful for Bitcoin's existence. I will sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.

You end it so sourly. "fuck it up"? Bitcoin is freedom to vote and run what people please. It is your opinion they are wrong if you think they are "fucking it up". That doesn't make you right.

In all honesty, I think typically normal people down-vote opinions they *disagree* with. That may not be how Reddit voting is supposed to work, but that is the truth without me sugar coating it. But it's still not bots. It's people voting, saying "I don't like what you've said."


I have thought about this all, I just don't care to explain my thought processes to every single person who demands it. 


There is no obligation to do so. It takes a **lot** of my time to do so, so I am selective about when I will take the time to explain, in full, my reasoning.
As an example: if a random man on the street says I owe him $1000, I'm not necessarily going to sit down and methodically break it down to him why this is not so. I chose not to, because it's a waste of my time. And the conversation drags on and on with no end.
That is the one common quality I see to the debate-- it never ends. There is never a resolution. And that is the ultimate weapon. **It's a delay tactic, and to exhaust the opposition by simply refuting anything and everything that comes into existence**.
There is a point where people run out of resources to disprove every single thing that comes their way. Time is a valuable commodity. For example I need to go back to work right now, but instead here I am discussing with you things that have been discussed a thousand times on here.


But it's not, when an agreement cannot be reached. It's a waste of time.
@_date: 2015-11-22 18:53:45

Yes, and it's completely up to anyone to do an official BIP or not. With Bitcoin, people are free to proceed however they want. They may have more luck along official routes, such as BIPs, but this doesn't mean someone is required to use it.
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:29:51
Thank you. I had the same question.
@_date: 2015-10-13 21:38:20


Yes, but in this case, artificially created necessity. But I see you feel it is necessary because of your next statement:


I think we agree on two things:
**1.)** We both do not want centralization.
**2.)** And we both want Bitcoin to be able to scale to handle a much higher transaction volume.
The only flaw that I see to the logic of your second sentence (above) is that by limiting the block size and building solutions on top of it, it shifts the control over to centralized company(ies) solution(s) for a higher number of transactions. So you end up creating the same problem that you were trying to avoid:
**a.)** In the case of increasing the maximum block size, we are presented by bigger blocks which you claim will lead to more centralization due to the increased resources necessary to propagate the blocks.
**b.)** And in the other case, by supporting a company's solution for increasing transaction volume, this is itself is a centralized effort and putting power into centralized hands.
So shouldn't we do both? This way we can keep the network as decentralized as possible by distributing the centralized risk, while also scaling transactions.
It does not need to be an "either/or". It can be both.
@_date: 2015-10-06 23:34:11

@_date: 2015-11-24 05:24:39
I also feel that we should implement additional layer 2 solutions, because most likely we will *have to* in order to reach the entire population of the Earth. But we also need bigger blocks, and honestly we should have as big of blocks as can be realistically supported by current bandwidth and technology, because this means as many transactions as possible can fit directly on the bitcoin blockchain, and that means less trusting of 3rd party solutions (layer 2 and Lightning Network type solutions)
I think we are more or less on the same page actually.
I feel the blocksize should be scaled as much as possible within realistic limits of technology and bandwidth-- As opposed to: minimizing the blocksize as much as possible in order to divert solutions to layer 2 and 3rd party solutions. 
As you said, it should never be made difficult to use on-blockchain transactions for those who want to. I completely agree. And we should give *as many people as possible* that ability. Layer 2 solutions come next of course, and have their rightful place.

You may want to ask yourself why both solutions can't be employed (increased transactions on the main chain as well as the additional service layers like Blockstream is offering).

I think you are correct-- Blockstream wants Bitcoin to do well. We are on the same page there.
That's not my question though.
Blockstream is a company, and the company ~~wants~~ needs to turn a profit for those venture capital investments which have been invested into it.
Any company needs to turn a profit to stay in existence, unless it is a donation-based, non-profit organization (which Blockstream is not).
So I ask again: How does Blockstream plan to earn its profit and by what means?

Any company is free to create whatever they want on top of the Blockchain.
My concern is with constricting the core database (Blockchain) size so that other solutions become mandatory out of force.

@_date: 2015-10-07 18:47:37
ouch! fuck lol
@_date: 2015-10-13 18:47:45
Yes I know it's just one vector. I acknowledge there can, and should be, and will be many approaches at increasing transaction quantity. As I said I am not against lightning networks, side chains, stroem, etc.
Any company is free to create whatever they want on top of the Blockchain.
My concern is with constricting the core database (Blockchain) size so that other solutions become mandatory out of force.
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:41:18
It's out the door!
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:58:57
I trust him more than I trust you
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:06:28
I found that very interesting. Thanks
@_date: 2015-10-27 20:05:21
I don't fully agree, but only time will truly tell
@_date: 2015-10-04 22:35:50
Too bad there's no Gavin Andresen in there. But I understand why.
@_date: 2015-10-27 04:01:04
I hope those guys stay left out

One of Bill Gates' mistaken ideas about bitcoin is in regards to transaction irreversibility. 
The following video is THE best video response I've ever seen to the tiresome complaint that bitcoin transaction irreversibility is a problem. Andreas debunks this claim in a few minutes with finesse.
Bill Gates needs to watch this clip so he gets we're dealing with a flexible *protocol* which is programmable and can offer reversals if needed.
This is why Bitcoin is more powerful than anything that has been seen before.
How do we get him to watch it?

Thank you! And functional too. ;)
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:03:20
I'll get some put up soon :)
@_date: 2013-08-16 14:44:48
Thank you very much. I have updated our entry with our logo.
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:51:00
That's a good idea. I implemented the site very simply, but I see the value of having an independant rating/review section. This would contribute to trust a lot. Kind of like amazon.com reviews, right? I'll see what I can come up with. If you have a good, simple solution I'm all ears.
@_date: 2013-08-15 13:16:28
Low fees, starting at 48 cents per label!
@_date: 2013-08-15 16:39:32
not yet, but i'm discussing that option right now for future implementation
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:45:02
Depends on which knife. Likely I will be putting up some nice stag antler bowie knives. I'd use the bitcoin wallet for small transactions and keep your hoard of bitcoin offline. I use bitminter too.
@_date: 2013-06-07 15:03:26
Thanks, perhaps I will.
@_date: 2013-06-07 21:20:57
All good points. Yes there is shipment information on how the procedure works:
and you may contact us at support to resolve any issues. Our physical address is also located on our checkout page on the shopping cart at the top.
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:24:28
All orders have been shipped out. If you're in USA, you'll be getting yours within 3-5 days.
@_date: 2013-08-16 14:22:03
Exactly. And escaping the use of fiat altogether by providing enough services that one could effectively live without the use of fiat is the ultimate goal. I'm glad you can see the big picture!
@_date: 2013-08-15 13:33:05
It's easy-- You just fill out the form on the "Create Label" page.
You will be given a unique link to your label.
Once your bitcoin payment has been verified on the blockchain, a label will be generated within 24 hours.
It is a .gif and you can simply print it on your printer onto label paper or plain paper.
@_date: 2013-08-16 14:45:50
Due to the bitcoin architecture the payment must be validated before the label can be generated.
However, label generation is now within the same day.
Also, all flat rate shipping boxes are now supported.
@_date: 2013-08-23 13:27:05
It's mostly hunting knives and folding/pocket knives. Some very nice damascus knives and speed assisted knives as well.
@_date: 2013-08-16 14:21:17
Our service allows the ability to ESCAPE the use of fiat.
Hoarding ONLY as a solution is not a currency. A currency is usable in daily life. We are making it more usable in daily life.
If you are too concerned with losing your hoard, then no one is stopping you from purchasing additional bitcoin for spending purposes.
I agree with both bittrivia and Frankeh's reply to your post.
@_date: 2013-08-15 13:38:32
Domestic labels are as low as $2.12 for up to a 3 ounce package.
International varies on the country.
It's depending on weight.
@_date: 2013-08-16 14:23:43
Yes. I am adding that feature right now actually. It will be up within the hour.
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:54:06
I'd recommend either of the Boker knives-- the lockback or the trapper.
Or perhaps the benchmark neck knife, although this is not a pocket knife. It is a phenomenal backpacker's knife.

Bitcoin is money.

**Flat Rate Boxes and shipping envelopes are now supported:**
* Small Flat Rate Box
* Medium Flat Rate Box
* Large Flat Rate Box
* Padded Bubble Flat Rate Envelope
* Letter size Flat Rate Envelope 
* Legal size Flat Rate Envelope

Definitely don't order something that is against your country's importing rules and regulations, or they will confiscate your knife. This is the buyer's responsibility, as we do not verify this information or regulate where we ship. We will literally ship anywhere.
@_date: 2013-08-15 13:09:04
Both fixed.
@_date: 2013-08-16 14:46:28
The labels will be generated the same day
@_date: 2013-08-17 13:15:19
Well said and a good point
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:13:57
It is legitimate. I understand the skepticism due to past sites! The buyers will soon see. Items have been shipped for all orders placed. A company builds credibility by fulfilling its promises, and that's what is happening here.
@_date: 2013-06-07 15:50:57
Yes, Bitcoin QT. Might need a reinstall and re-download the block chain
@_date: 2013-08-16 14:23:07
Yes, it is unfortunate that some cannot see past hoarding as the only use of bitcoin.
There is a very easy solution to this. Simply save your investment (hoard) of bitcoin in a separate wallet from your spending bitcoin. And purchase bitcoin only to spend it, but do not touch your original investment (hoarding) of bitcoin. That way you are using it AND saving it at the same time.
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:58:34
1. Yes we ship to Europe and all over the world.
2. I have the entire damascus hunting knife line custom made for me. They are handmade knives made of the highest quality 1095 high carbon steels and are not made in China. The other knives are from various parts of the world, some are China-made but they are quality built.
3. Yes, I'm adding even more knives (within the next week).
