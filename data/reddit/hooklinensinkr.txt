Dare you to take it to an airport.

Maybe in the Midwest. That's a bungalow where I am.

I mean..if you own a house in a lot of places 100k can be 20% or less of your net worth. That's not rich, it's just not struggling.

This doesn't paint this subreddit in the best light..

Currently the absolute edge of bioengineering is the fairly unreliable (currently) [CRISPR]( and that's simply splicing between specific genes. You really think in 20-30 years that will progress into nanobots that can completely reconstruct a shattered genome? Ice crystals absolutely decimate cells, we've been trying to get something as simple as the single uniform carbon layer that is graphene out of the lab for over a decade now. 
EDIT: To provide a link to the timeline of CRISPR development

The problem with cryo is we don't know how to do it without forming ice crystals that destroy cells and DNA..so not only would we have to cure ALS, we'd have to figure out how to revive someone who's cells were literally shattered by ice crystals like freezer burned steak.

Yes, you should be able to. Fuck a nany state. If someone lies about what they're doing and scams you then that's against the law, which we already have protections for. If you're some pensioner who's neighbor kid wants a $3000 loan for some lawncare equipment to start a business and they're willing to give you 10%, then fuck anyone who tells you you can't give him that money.

Why not just list a dollar value and then take the equivalent when they pay?
Edit: or point the QR code to a website of your own with a bitcoin calc and payment system.

Yet you did exactly that. 


It's clear you're just parroting some opinions without having any of your own knowledge or life experience. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:10:44
You've completely gone off topic
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:02:38
Then you got scammed. There are a ton of ways to scam someone that don't involve small business funding. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:05:03
I think you've forgotten the point you're trying and failing to make.

Ublock? Not at all. Adblock straight up lets people pay to let ads through.

Coinbase did the same for me on Dec 22nd. Made a new account, threw my new account weekly max (250) on the credit card with plans to do that 3 more times..never went through and bitcoin's never been that high again. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:13:16
Just so you know no one uses AdBlock anymore, the developers sold it out. uBlock Origin has been the go to for most for maybe 3 years now.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:35:19
Yeah uBlock lets you do that with the eyedropper. It's quite simple, not sure why this sub is living so far in the past because I haven't even seen AdBlock on reddit in years, but all you have to do is read the documentation.
