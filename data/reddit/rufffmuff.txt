Imagine if you posted a comment on reddit/yelp saying something critical about your barber. And another negative comment about your mechanic and local car wash. 
Thiel hated u/eintnohick, so he went to the barber, mechanic and car wash and said I will fund a lawsuit against that bastid u/eintnohick, for free.  They are baseless lawsuits but you have to lawyer up regardless, soon the bills will mount up and if just ONE of those lawsuits actually works and rules against you.  You will be toast.
That's what happened.  The guy is not good.  Gawker was questionable but it could have been some other publication you liked.

“The Hill has reached out to Bitcoin for comment”
Good luck with that

This is a preposterous statement

Good luck buying any property in NYC now, if there's no confidence in the stock market investors will turn elsewhere. Not convinced it's Bitcoin, yet, although it ought to be.

You can't say Thiel is pro-freedom when what he did to Gawker was essentially an attack on press freedom.
Say what you will about Gawker, not discussing pro/against. Thiel literally paid for attorneys for ANYONE that Gawker featured in a negative light. Gawker was a blog.. if the Hogan thing didn't bring it down, the sheer volume of lawsuits would bankrupt it eventually.
Edit: it's heartbreaking to see all my replies are based on your attitude that Gawker deserved it. I don't give a fuck. All I'm saying is Thiel has pioneered a successful formula for millionaires to silence the press. Yes, this time is was a gossip rag but next time it could be some resource you care about.

huh? surely smaller blocks would be easier to transmit and ingest when dealing with less than optimal connectivity

Don't be bothered by this. He was commenting on the shrewdness of their efforts; like it or not they created billions out of ~~hot~~ thin air. 
It's a tip of the hat.

Why are you being difficult? If they are validating transactions then they are helpful to the network. Enough said.

Can someone explain how being able to generate private keys for Litecoin that are identical to Bitcoin isn't a huge vulnerability?

You're literally saying that because he's open about being crooked, that you're ok with it? Man fuck off

No that’s pretty much what happened last time and will happen next week. Check microcenter.com next week for open box graphics cards
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:46:52
Er, did they explain something that I’m not seeing? Of course there’s an obstruction on one side but what’s the explanation for the other side? Seems like they could have matched it.

Many 2FA is time based. Assuming a bot is doing it, the success rate would be high if it's quick enough.

Do you have any on coinbase? I think transfers between accounts are free if thy have an account.

2005 called, stop using AVG. it's been shit for years. Windows 8 comes with Defender (which is an antivirus btw) and it's fine. I think they don't publicize it due to antitrust concerns.
