Haha, not trying to make money off tips.  Gonna use everything I get towards our business of getting btc known and used.

Thank you very much.  It is really going to be nice to finally get things rolling.

No, not yet :(  It's ok.  I am hoping once I get in Bitcoin Magazine and people read our story on how we just want people to use it locally than I will get more support because theirs a lot of interest but a lot of people need help with getting everything set up.  And that's where we would step in.

Making it to the next bitcoin convention is my main personal goal at this time so I can show off my new tattoo!!!

FYI:Btc magazine was given or put the wrong qr code on the article.  Could have been my fault.   The tattoo does not scan because it's still swollen.  When this picture was taken it was taken within the first couple hours after completion.  If you all go to Youtube you can see that qr codes can be scanned even if they are tattooed on you.

lol.  I do feel kind of weird having a qr code as my first tattoo.  I kinda feel like I am part of some experiment and all I have is a code embedded in my arm that they can scan to identify who I am like some futuristic movie.  I guess the future is now and they can scan my arm all day long because it's my wallet address and it would be to pay me.  HAHAHA

Haha, Thanks.  I won't.  I am super stoked.  Supposedly I am the first to get it done.  I been speaking to Ruben Alexander from Bitcoin Magazine and sounds like they are pretty pumped on the idea of someone actually taking it to the next level and getting a tattoo.

The tattoo is covered again.  I just had it done Friday afternoon.  So it's not healed yet.
