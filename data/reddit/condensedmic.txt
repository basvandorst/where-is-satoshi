I too have sold bitcoin at 1000, 1800, 2200 to cover my initial investment. Do I regret it, yes of course. Did I sell all of it? Luckily no, even though I'm told by people I'm being stupid all the time.

Hindsight is 20/20. At least that’s what I tell myself. Hehe.

Isn't it argued that bitcoins are a store of wealth as well? You don't have to be holding bitcoins just to spend in the near future like most people using physical cash.

How did you even get your account verified? I've been waiting 3 weeks now, a couple friends have been waiting 2 weeks. I've tried calling them everyday for a week and no one is ever available. I'm not even convinced they're really even in business anymore or at least accepting new clients.

I think that's a little simplistic. If we acted on all the penny stocks out there (which there are thousands that promise riches) we probably wouldn't be very far ahead and probably behind.

I just upgraded to Electrum 1.9.5 and still see all my used receiving addresses still. Is this what it's supposed to hide? I'm using the mac version. This new version looks identical to 1.9.4.

I won't because mostly I can't. But, I wish I could which is the point of my post. Sigh.

This is true. This man is right.

I agree. All I can think about is how I knew about bitcoins over a year ago and I just didn't go all in because of the uncertainty. I don't think this is healthy, but I can't stop myself from thinking about it. (not healthy)

This is simple. Pay taxes.

New trades could be a little much if you're trying to act fast. Though the option of it would be nice. Withdraws though should be 2FA mandatory alongside asking for your password a second time.

He's gonna need a lot more coins to buy a the kinda yacht everyone here is picturing.

True. It gets tougher mentally to invest more into bitcoin when you've been socking away hard earned money into your retirement fund diligently for 10, 20, 30, or more years.

I'm Canadian. So no bad news you know of?

You're only considering currency in circulation. Like physical bills and coins. You need to consider how much wealth is kept in digital form. A millionaire is certainly rich, but he might only have 20 bucks on a him at any given time in cash. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Yes. No new influx of money.
