I don´t know if this is a good or a bad thing, more stable prices are good for long therm adoption, but at the same I`m always expecting and almost automatic reaction to bad and good news.

I posted a similar question not long ago,the best answer was that the market already expected this good news,so the actual confirmation doesnt changue the price.

Is a cultural thing for the chinese goverment. They make slow and small changes and they see how they work, then they go back or forward depending on what they see and want at the moment. I think that is a very smart way to make new regulations. Is like they are playing igo.

this is relevant, could you elaborate more for those of us who are not in the us, and are not familiar with your tax laws?
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:49:51
That is a really good point. I wasn`t considering that most of the news, if not all, were already expected.

Thanks for your answer. And yes, this all could be a bubble. If it is, I dare to say we are in the "media atention" phase. But, even if this is a bubble I do believe that bitcoin has a real value as the money of the new era.

Super sad about your moms now :(

Is this true? If it is, could you please elaborate a little more because I`m very tempted tou buy from mt.gox now that you can from latinoamerica.

Is reddit even real?
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:01:27
A lot of thanks for the explanation :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:04:58
I will try to kill myself to be sure :)

Thanks for all the great responses until now. And excuse me for my bad English. I get this from the answers you just gave:
+The news were already expected and thus the effect was already incorporated in the price.
+There is a lot of people entering the market, but they have to past a huge wall if they wanna star trading.
+Bitcoin had a recent crash and is recovering fast.

Is there a way to confirm this? Por favor misterioso chino parlante ven a nuestro rescate!!!
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:56:19
Especialy because the "bad China news" related to the banks had and almost immediate effect. The price crashed in an instant and the desicion of China wasn`t really a bad thing, it was good or neutral at most. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:42:31
looks like a scam to me...
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:59:43
What i don´t understand is why it keeps falling down :).
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:15:39
I think your example is really smart and it shows a big  problem with the state of bitcoins markets rigth now: there is a lot of barriers if you want to enter the market, you have to read a lot, find a good trading site, fund it and pass their verification process. If you are in a country that does not have a trading site this could take weeks or even months.

Thanks for your advice. I think I can do basic math, but I would just like help because this is a critical matter if you want to do this rigth. 
I made a simple excell table that I use to help me, but I want confirmation of more inteligent people than myself. Also, there is a language barrier if your are from south america as I am and is posible that I`m not catching on something. 
This is the sistem I`m using rigth now:
1. I take the numbers of bitcoin (Nb), the price (Pb) and the fee(f) to calculate the cost (C)
C=Nb*Pb - f(Nb*Pb)
2. With this information now I calculate the target price(Pt), taking into consideration the profit(r) I expect to make.
And that`s it. Thanks :).
