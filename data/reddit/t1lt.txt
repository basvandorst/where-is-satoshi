Yeah, right. The other day I was trashing Obama in the internet and bam a "drone" came through my window and killed me. Except this does not happen... yet. But seriously, the US is still much better off than China and the millions of their own people they have killed with their regime. Even if the US is that horrible you would still have to multiply it by a couple orders of magnitude to reach PRC level.

It was a matter of time. Economies that rely on State monopoly, like Communism does, would not like the idea of something like Bitcoin.
Now that they are aware they will probably try to track people that access bitcoin related websites and things like that, seizing some PCs from time to time to see if they are "money laundering".

He's nice but he is naive to the max, why have blind faith in bitcoin "because good things go well". OP maybe old but it's as wise as a 5 year old girl

In Communist doublespeak their dictatorships are the best democracy ever because in theory, and only in theory, every citizen rules and owns the means of production, anarcho-collectivism. Other countries that have capitalist economies are not democratic no matter what (hur oppression of the proletariat, etc). So there is that.

Go to Tiananmen with a banner saying "The Party Sux" and tell me how well things go for you.

Yeah, right because Linux exploits don't exist at all and the average sysadmin is a genius.

Let's hope their Govt does not find about Bitcoin, then because what would stop them from trying to tax people that use Bitcoins or sue for tax evasion given their climate.

Because South American countries have been steadily gravitating towards Socialism after they got out of their anti-Communist dictatorships, I guess that only delayed it for a while. 
How else would you pay for inefficient social programs and claim to redistribute wealth if not by taking money from those who do work? All of this goes hand-in-hand of a high income tax policy which is Communism 101.

Well yes *Crony* Capitalism is harmful, but that's not the point.
If you disregard the fact that Argentine is, perhaps only second to Uruguay, part of the leading leftist States in South America and believe that this economic crisis they are in would have nothing to do with their economic stance, given that socialism is an economic stance, then I don't know what could be the culprit of it.
Also every socialist regime that have been on earth that I'm aware of was/is corrupt, I mean, they could talk all they want about equality but the result is always the slave working to feed the elites. The USSR had plenty of resources in their time, yet millions starved to death, the very ones who worked gathering food starved to death.
For example, in the Communist Manifesto Marx and Engels propose:

There you have in Marxist brand of Socialism from heavy taxation, to government monopolies, forced socialization, confiscation of everything for the ones that disagree, labor camps, no liberty to live, work or even communicate as you please, and institutionalized propaganda. 
Even Marx and Engels agree that "Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected **except by
means of despotic inroads** on the rights of property" right before their decalogue (see previous link). If you think despotism can ever be good then well we're talking past each other and I don't hope for serious dialog.
I'm not capitalistic but Capitalism seems to me the best system because not only it allows people their rightful freedom to the wages of their work but also deregulation means you reduce the evil that a bad Government can cause.

Protip, if you lend money, count that as loss/gift.
I mean, it's great if they pay you back and if they don't they shouldn't expect to still be trusted, but it saves you headaches in various ways.

Yes but I mean they could monitor your web traffic and deduce it from seeing which sites you access, like blockchain or even  for instance :)

Brazil is far from being economically free, though. Still much better that Argentine in that regard.

Don't be silly! In China you don't get to decide or even worry about that, the Party does! ;)

Social contract is a socialist thing (don't confuse it with Marxism, another branch of socialism), though, at least as implied here as [related to Rousseau's writings.](

Dang! You should ask bitcoin grampa for some stories about the grand depression, and some incidental bitcoin tips, to cheer you up!^/s
If you want to beg at least be straight forward and you won't need the drama and to victimize yourself, man the hell up.

Good question, perhaps internet providers could give them such info. Still they wouldn't know for sure how much and if you received bitcoin at all just perhaps that you access bitcoin related sites, etc.
But it makes sense for them to outlaw Bitcoin, given that they heavily restrict buying dollars I don't see why they wouldn't do that.

Well let's wait for someone to put their neck (and possibly also their family) in the line and see whose interpretation is right.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:54:51
Also let's ignore the fact that China has multiple prisons like that and that labor camps are part of the guidelines for Communism.
Obviously Gitmo is bad and the US should get rid of it (if some president had campaigned for that I'd vote for him^/s) but along with the other less known that exist they are pretty much the exception, but in PRC that and worse is the norm.
