This is the difference between a oppressive, hateful, vindictive, controlling, damaging, imperialistic state of mind.
Compared to those who want freedom.
The 'War on Drugs', isn't hardly about drugs at all. It's about military industry, political positioning (e.g. lying about 'drugs' to gain power), corrupt corporatism, and more.
You sir, need to learn more as I won't go into lecture mode here, but seriously.

Because of 'drugs and stuff'.
Ye .. I won't deal with banks because of DEFINITE confirmed massive drug cartel money laundering, slave trade, wars (and the mass murder than comes with it), theft (as open and arrogant as anything), cons, outrageous crappy customer service, political interference, stealing the wealth of the poor.
etc, etc, I'm sure others can come up with more reasons.

Honestly ... It's going to come down to the singularity, and when you know a lot about Bitcoin you tend to come to the same conclusion. 
That - No one has any sodding idea when, or even that it will definitely happen. I think it will, eventually. But the factors that contribute to it are really unfathomable, we simply don't know whats going to happen later this afternoon, let alone tomorrow.
But we can guess, and thats always fun! :)
A rise in August, then level'd out again, then a steady rise to November/December, then you'll see a huge spike in December 
Christmas: Internet sales have increased rapidly over the last few years, and Bitcoin being a more convenient and much safer way (for merchant and customer) to trade online, and fraud (credit card) normally spikes during December, giving more appeal to Bitcoin. And the continuing declining global economy by that point (which we can all see happening).
Then a relatively small crash in January (businesses transferring back to fiat), which might continue to decline for 2-3 weeks (probably classed as a 2nd spike). Then I dunno, next year, who knows what it will bring.
Then there's Argentina, depending how things develop there, and who knows when some hugely rich person or company will decide to adopt/invest. Or a nation suddenly approving of Bitcoin.
Though most importantly - When will the banks start mass adopting Bitcoin? Fidor bank has now (in Germany), and the Internet Credit Union (for its locality).
Some try to summarise Bitcoin adoption as too similar to technology adoption. Like the automobile, TV, computers, mobile phones, the internet, etc. But its not just that, its a monetary system, decentralised, its adoption rate will be quite different that pure technologies.
Hence the spikes, the interest and lack of and why, unlike a simple technology advancement, and the continued very interesting style and rate of adoption.
No one knows what tomorrow may bring. But it will be damn interesting to see.

@_date: 2013-09-27 20:07:04
I'd say IBWT, you can do a whole gbp deposit/buy/sell/withdraw within 1 day, and their banking partner is backed by FCA and they have a correct business account to operate from.
And of course IBWT deposit/withdraw is at £1,000 per day, and there is no limit to the amount of bitcoin you can buy/sell at any point.
And the value that people buy/sell is set by the traders directly (exactly like gox and other exchanges).

You don't need to wait for 6 confirmations. You can wait for just 1, or 0.
So really, your wait time with bitcoins is far less. What you're talking about is "Wait time until its really really secure"
And if you're comparing Faster Payments, then you need to use the 5-7 days, after the few hours. And even then, it's not as secure as waiting for 6 confirmations on the Bitcoin network.

The most likely scenario is that another viable digital currency will become the 'small change' of bitcoin (with a lesser value due to certain mathematics (double the total quantity, and/or produced faster, etc, quite a few things could give a 2nd 'smaller change' currency lesser value).
End of the day, its nothing to worry about, ever tbh :) 
'Smaller' digital currencies will always be able to be made along the same principles, for many many years into the future :)
This way, you never, ever, need to devalue Bitcoin, whilst at the same time providing the economy extra currency when needed. It will naturally happen, and is happening already.

couldn't agree more. All those threads about "amagad, the difficulty is rising, how will I ever make my fortune!! QQ!" are full of greedy sods.
Yes, its nice to make money, but being a miner isn't just about the 'profit' (which is still very substantial if you are of the mind that btc will rise in value significantly within the next 5-15 years even if you only get a few btc).
Mining is also about the 'philosophy of bitcoin', doing your part in free'ing yourself and the world (again, if you're inclined to think this way).
Less greed "amagad, so high difficulty, want shiny bittycoins!"
And more cool posts like the op :)

Typical really, someone posts something trying to assist and give a bit of clarification as to why people use Bitcoins and they get insulted and attacked (yawn).
So you think people would USE an item because they "cause the death of 100,000 babies." No, clearly you don't think that.


Again - "why people use Bitcoins" - 
Let me try to explain this a bit simpler for you .. If say, using Bitcoins caused babies to fall over dead
Then people would NOT be using Bitcoins to make Babes fall over dead. (Unless you a sick psychopath).
This is a post about why people DO use Bitcoins. Understand? Still too complicated?
If there was a lot of people (in this subreddit) asking "Why do people NOT use Bitcoins." And I felt like writing a post about "Why do people NOT use Bitcoins." Then I would write about why people do NOT use Bitcoins ... But seeing as I have noticed numerous times people asking "Why DO people use Bitcoins." I decided to write a post regarding "Why people DO use Bitcoins."
I really don't know how much easier I can explain this ...
You sir are definitely a person that should leave their money in the bank for someone else to look after, such things as Bitcoin are clearly far too complicated for you.


Look in a mirror :)
p.s. feel free to write an article as to "why people do NOT use Bitcoins." And put all your cons there, I look forward to tearing it apart ;)
p.p.s. Again, there ARE 'cons' that exist atm (very small things which don't actually effect how bitcoin works), but they are things I would note as they are significant as to "why people do NOT use Bitcoins."
I bet you won't actually write anything, or if you do, it'll be full of misinformation, propaganda and downright false information (btw, this is me prodding you with a virtual 'prod' to inspire you to actually write down the cons in a new post, please point me towards it when done). Of course, I still think you won't write anything, instead replying with something like "ohhh, I don't need to, bitcoin is crap mmkay, if I can't touch it, its not real, durr." ;)

Also, consider the amount of 'transactions' that don't happen via the exchanges. Quite a lot of people globally buying/selling bitcoins, which if sold via the exchanges would probably be increasing the value far faster than its current rate.
So unless you have a way to know what addresses in the blockchain belong to what country, there is simply no way to get a decent guess at the true value/amount of transactions, only that it is far more than our simple statistics can show.
I think thats what Mr Erik was getting at.

Its the difference between, say, if you worked for McDonalds, and you were out with friends talking about them. If you referred to them as 'they'.
But when you're doing work for them, and wearing a McDonalds uniform and you're stood behind the counter, then you refer to McDonalds as 'we'.
Unless you're a die hard fan of McDonalds and always refer to them as 'we'. 
Though there are professions, like the police force, or other related services (doctors), where people are technically 24/7 working, and do often refer to themselves as 'we'. IBWT is a company however, and I do get time off ;)

A pretentious hipster? heh, not sure if I'd class myself as that, but ok, could you clarify how I came across like that?
I said that because I try to be honest and a question was asked. It is unfortunately a human trait, to fear what one does not understand, and then that fear often turns to hate.
Monopolies tend to feed that fear as they do not want change.
If you are saying that humans do not fear what they do not understand, then I say that you should look through human history. 
And let me repeat myself, not all humans fear/hate what they don't understand, many do actually go and seek out more information. A question was asked, and I answered it.

Media attention has shifted from dark/bad/illegal/drugs to interesting/future money?/regulation/legal/recognized.
And the % of people reacting to these has shifted to a new paradigm. Meaning - before, there was a 'certain type' of people that reacted before, but with this new 'level' of media reporting it has now grabbed a new 'sphere of influence' on society.
It will reach different levels as acceptance spreads, and each level draws in a different 'type' of person.

OP - there's a trick that the UK, the US, and basically banking models have used over the centuries, which I'm sure you know about.
Naming a bank along the lines of - "Bank Of England." (well, it used to be public owned), "Bank Of America." "International Monetary Fund." "World Health Organisation." .. etc, etc .. the thing is, these organisations all start nationally but use the terms 'World, International, Global', etc, etc.. To portray their global reach, which really its not at first, but does soon become so. And the name itself tricks people into thinking that they ARE an international firm (and not really just a US firm looking to seize most of the market).
Anyway - Depending what your banks long term goals are, and seeing as its Bitcoin we're talking about here. I suggest something with one of the words imbedded.
1. World
2. International
3. Global
4. WorldWide (or WW)
5. Universal
Though I highly suggest no 1. As due to the psychology of human nature - World blah blah - has more of an initial impact.
There's many good ideas/suggestions, just throw in the extra word is my thoughts. E.g.
World Genesis Bank - WGB 
International Cryptoligcal Bank - ICB
Open Global Bank - OGB
And my favourite, for truly psychological warfare against the current regime and to attract attention and hopefully a vast amount of customers!

It is extremely unlikely you would now be a millionaire, for those coins to have increased in value you would have to have been part of the people that were also selling/using/investing coins, for them to have increased in value.
So by now, you'd be hellova richer, but not a millionaire, like others said, you probably would've sold most on an 'up' at some point, and used others.
So don't feel bad, we're still under the 1% of adoption, its still VERY early to 'get into' Bitcoin.

You think I am 'new to this community'? 
I propose that you seem very new to 'fraud'.
The amount of fraud committed via Bitcoin is pitiful compared to the amount of fraud done via fiat, snail mail, email, door to door, telephone, etc.
And you seem to have 'selectively' only copied half of no 3, which points towards you being a troll.
3) No fraud or charge-back.
I will edit the OP appropriately, since apparently this is not clear enough for you to indicate from a business PoV (sellers suffer from charge-back, not buyers).
And I feel you must be new to Bitcoin? Or you do not realise that fraud/charge back can not happen with Bitcoin. Well, it can't.
Individuals can be subject to scams/fraud. Businesses can't be subject to FRAUD.

minimum transaction values can change (but you probably knew that).
And viable alt coins will/already exist for the 'change' of bitcoin when Bitcoin value increases to xxx amount.
The viability of appropriate alt coins (litecoin) to act as change is just not apparent yet, and won't be until bitcoin itself has its value raised to the point where it needs change.
Summary: altcoins.

An interesting point .. would Bitcoins ever take global dominance of currency? No one can really say, and I think its a bit arrogant to say it will at this stage of Bitcoin.
I think its fairer to say that Bitcoin has the strong potential to become a strong 'competing currency'. In that its value will rise, but other currencies (such as fiat) might always exist beside it.

Dear OP,
Welcome to the global empires banking blockage.
Unless laws specifically change forcing banks to allow Bitcoin trade, you can expect this a lot more, from a lot more banks (especially in the US). They'll probably freeze your account next.
My suggestion, go withdraw all your fiat asap. Or just leave what you need to pay fiat bills.
Banks are perfectly entitled to freeze/grab/take all your funds with them, because the second you give it them, its not yours anymore and they can do as they wish with it.
Not all banks are a blight, but a lot are, unfortunately.

Thank you, and thank you for your comments. It's the rough and truthful feedback that really shapes someone :)
And I have taken your words into consideration (I've been more forward with my exact position, etc, I am Director btw).
We do plan to (over time) to present publicly our methods, and processes, and whatever else we can (API due within a month or so)  so that customers can have a clear understanding of what happens. But a step at a time.
On the 'smoothly' remark I made, we have had customers already try us out during our pre-launch, and I've used the system myself, so I'll be cheeky and stand by this remark and ask you to come and test our services for yourself (and if we don't please I will take your feedback to heart and the team will make adjustments).
I will be the first to say, it is still very early days for IBWT, its a been long time getting here, but the ride has only just started. We are most certainly not 'perfect', and only with customer support, and pointing out such things (as you have) will we become THE exchange that you (and everyone else in the UK) deserves.
Your words are appreciated, thank you.

No, seriously, you should both research and learn more. Bitcoin (and viable altcoins) are very serious contenders for a new primary monetary system, amongst other things
Bitcoins are not 'just' a type of money, its just that they are being used as such at the moment. The protocol is primarily a means to transfer and store wealth and ownership, which is far more valuable than just a 'type of money'.
The potential for various uses exceed the general understanding (definitely also mine), there are things that the protocol will be used for that we have not even dreamed up yet.
I suggest, spending a little (as bitcoins), investing a little (shares, or a miner, etc), and keeping the rest for future spending.

@_date: 2013-05-26 19:24:35
Good questions.
6a) No one can really say 6a for certain, its just one of the 'why' people do get Bitcoins.
9a) Initial point of payment - If Bitcoin was adopted for national expenses, then its fair to assume that it would become law to publicly identify any initial wallet that 'wages' went into, or were used for political expenses. And similarly, businesses would probably be made (legally) to notify tax offices of the 'wage wallets', for tax purposes. After that initial payment, then yes, the money can be made anonymous by various methods. Though it is fair to also say that it is likely that certain organisations (such as charities or political parties) may be required to show expenses and donations (tbh, they are required to do so already in a lot of countries, to an extent).
Also - If anyone wanted to donate to a political party, or pay your members fee, then it becomes identified and trace'able, until they try to hide it. Then yes, suspicion should be raised and relevant authorities told.
14a) I stand corrected, local bank accounts to same banks are instantaneous and free, as you said (Bitcoin is global however). I am very surprised you had to wait 1 hour. With a fee attached, 6 confirmations tends to go very quickly. This is the 1st time I've heard of anyone waiting 1 hr (or more) when they've also paid the fee.
On your oil/water question - You are correct, the prices would go up and down, as this would be a supply/demand matter on the commodity itself. My example was meant to indicate static items. 
If supply/demand changed on a commodity, then they would change accordingly. But that would not mean the price would change for other items, like bread, or cheese, etc. The price would change for only that commodity as Bitcoin would be relatively static. With fiat, inflation means the change of price of all production items to fall in line with inflation. 
With no inflation the price changes only relative to the item itself.
Hope that answers your questions?

it also means that when the production/supply of asics slows down, the value will shoot up, because less bitcoins will be produced (it'll shift back to every 10 minutes when it has a chance to catch up) then less on the market/exchanges (its still monetary supply inflation, just less of).
Though saying that, value is still subject to a host of other factors.
Anyone holding bitcoins for when the 'asic shift' is over will be a lot better off.

The simplest way -
Have an internet connect, computer, and a bitcoin-qt wallet, have a calculator (on your computer or some free till software can probably be found).
Work out the amount on the till, type in the amount in your qt wallet, then tell your wallet to generate a QR code, turn screen to customer, tell them to scan the QR code.
There, can work for any merchant.
Most merchants use the bitpay (and similar) options to receive the amount in their fiat currency. But sooner or later, more will adopt to pure bitcoin.
Bitpay and Exchanges are just a temporary addition to allow for the adaption of the system.

The 'War on Drugs' was and still is a MASSIVE CON by governments around the world. Designed to fill their pockets and control dissidents (check out the original terminology for 'terrorism', and think about it, and think about why the terminology got changed, really).

I forgot to add. I put to you to test your own words:
Get 2 friends. 1 is the receiver (R) and the other is the sender (S1), and you're a sender (S2).
Get S1 to send R money via a different bank, western union, money gram, etc, etc, everything you can think of (apart from - same bank, same nation, because in that, as said, you're correct, that is faster).
Now, you, as S2, each time S1 sends money you send Bitcoins to R. Test how long it takes for R to receive the funds in each case, and compare. Try to get at least 3-5 different types of sending (you sending Bitcoins vs S1's different methods each time).
Now if you have the money, try this - Up the ante, get S2 to send $15,000+ through each organisation. Banks, western union, money gram, etc. And you send $15,000+ (or any amount tbh, try a million if you have it).
And compare how long it takes for the money to go through to R with each method at this increased value. (Ok, if you don't have that kind of money then just go read the bank websites, money union, etc, rules on sending large cash amounts to get an idea).

I should have made this clearer, apologies.
The question breaches into point 15. By the 'end of inflation', I'm indicating the time when no more Bitcoins will be available to be mined (2040), and only IF the Bitcoin was the reserve currency (like how the USD is today).
At this point, no more Bitcoins to be mined, thus inflation for intents and purposes ends. IF the Bitcoin was the reserve currency, and IF being the world currency it has reached its 'cap' in value (e.g. $1mil per btc). Then it won't get deflated much further. Hence, at this point (being reserve currency and all btc mined), it will remain (for intents and purposes) static. For example, if I dropped £1 down a drain I don't think the rest of the fiat world would care or be effected.
So it would not be inflationary (production/introduction of more Bitcoins), and it won't be deflationary (as being the reserve currency). Let's refer to this as the *Bitcoin Cap*.


At the proverbial 'cap'. Items such as oil/water/corn/sugar, etc, will still rise/fall in price due to their own supply/demand. The Bitcoin value will remain static (relatively staying at the same value), whilst the price of items will change depending upon their supply/demand.
Now, if it rained diamonds tomorrow, value of diamonds would drop drastically. But this would not effect the price of your water bills, or gas bills, etc.
If, lets say, diamonds were 100 Bitcoins per 1 diamond. And after the rain people valued diamonds at 1 Bitcoin per 1 diamond. This would not change the value of the Bitcoin. Only the value of the diamond. Your bread will still be the same price.
*keep in mind that I believe Bitcoin &amp; inflation do not mix, in that Bitcoin is essentially immune to inflation.*

I just want to throw in also.
Imagine that Bitcoin got regulated to the satisfaction of governments.
Imagine that Government offered benefits in Bitcoin at a 10% less, because its Bitcoin.
Imagine the adoption that would follow.
Imagine the increase in wealth, poverty decreasing, etc, etc,
Imagine the changes that would follow.
Similar thing would happen if regulation &gt; taxation (means that governments must buy a LOT of Bitcoin to provide tax repayments, etc, an amount to keep as a 'float')

Highlighted one of the most significant things businesses tend to bypass, unfortunately, due to a lack of faith in Bitcoins. In that anyone dealing/selling merchandise/services in Bitcoin CAN in fact very profitably offer their merchandise/services CHEAPER than any fiat competitor, due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoins. Though this only works if business in question allows time for their sale of btc to increase by xx% to validate their profit margin.

Here's a few reasons businesses/individuals might choose to use Bitcoin (though ofc I'm sure there's more).
WHAT IS BEHIND BITCOIN?
1.	Lower fees
2.	Lower transactions
3.	No barrier to adoption
4.	Far far easier to adopt than card machines
5.	Cheaper than card machines (from a business PoV)
6.	No overdraft charges (you are your own bank)
7.	A far FAR higher rate of 'room to grow' (e.g. increase in value) than it can decrease.
8.	Does not rely on bank trust (have you looked at the economy lately?)
9.	Does not have 'middle-men' (it is FULLY INCLUSIVE!) 9.1 - no more stolen funds from 'charities' 9.2 - no more massive cuts for businesses and individuals when send money anywhere (to friends or for buying goods) 9.3 - no ability for the banks and corrupt powers that be to STOP your transactions
10.	Banks and governments can not seize your wealth (unless they waterboard you and you give up your password).
11.	Whenever you use your credit/debit card you are GIVING full access to your card details to whoever is on the other side (phone or net), and they can then use your details and spend your money.
12.	Point 11 does not compute with Bitcoin (its impossible).
13.	Bitcoin is HIGHLY fraud resistant.
14.	Bitcoin is very young and has amazing potential to grow and develop (9.0 will be very interesting).
15.	There is a limit to how much you can withdraw from an ATM and/or from your Bank.
16.	There is a limit to how much money (fiat/paper money) you can take with you when you go abroad.
17.	Officials (or anyone) can steal your money whilst you travel, etc.
18.	15, 16, and 17 does not apply to Bitcoin.
19.	Bitcoin is open source!! (extremely important!)
20.	All addresses are publicly viewable!!! (amagad! yes really, imagine if you could see all the corruption in government and official bodies, because you could see exactly who was donating/bribing what and how much).
21.	Imagine, you're in tescos (or a bus, or any other shop, etc), there are huge queues, people are paying with their change, and you're having to wait for credit card transactions to go through. 30 minutes later you finally get served.
22.	Imagine, you're in tescos, etc, there are huge queues, everyone takes 10-20 seconds to pay, because all they have to do is &gt; face phone to screen, push phone (send) button, done.
23.	Taxes. Imagine all the stupidly rich and corrupt (individuals and businesses) could no longer hide all their taxes (freaking government preaches about tax evasion, when really its the millionaires and the corps that do 90% (probably more) of the tax evasion). Imagine the economy recovering from all that wealth coming back into the system.
24.	Accountability. Imagine politicians and those in power being held accountable for their actions.
25.	Inflation (end of). Hyperinflation is incoming, government has lied about inflation for quite a long time. If you really want to see the true rates of inflation look at the value of milk, bread, a chocolate bar, etc, over the last 10 years, that will give you a good example of the true rate. 25.1 - The bitcoin protocol actually has inflation also ('mining'), but at FAR lesser rate (in value) and with a system that steadily decreases over time.
26.	Deflation - Natural deflation is the real state of an economy. Inflation is a lie, and has been used as a tool to control the masses and divert wealth to the extremely few. Bitcoin suffers from natural deflation (which is a VERY GOOD thing!).
27.	Uncontrollable bankers. Banks are too big and corrupt to stop head on, there are way too many politicians in the bankers pockets (and the army).

Let me guess, you're trolling like a mofo because you do it all the time?
/care that there's a fixable glitch, the techies and the community work together to fix a problem, a *GLOBAL COMMUNITY* (albiet, a very small one relative to the total population), but still a community on a global scale that is governed by the people, not the elite destructive powers that be.
When communities come together to solve a problem they do it in their best interest, when individuals work to solve a problem, they also do it in their best interest.
Hence the falacy of all centralised money types, they're reliant upon the individual who is always corruptable (because self interest is generally paramount and self interest will always run contrary to another individual), where as a decentralised currency is dependent upon the masses (again, self interest, but self interest of the masses).
Thats the point.
p.s. I didn't type this for you, because you're a troll, and trolls are fugly. I typed this because I've been itching to type it somewhere :)

OP, do some financial history research, throw in the media mix. Humanity has had hundreds of years of drilling into it (especially the last century) about how money is only money if its paper money and issued from the government and how inflation is 'good' (its a poison that must be enforced, deflation is natural for a monetary type).
It's been very carefully built that way by the powers that be (check the petrodollar). It's a centuries old lie.
It's going to take quite a bit more than a few years and some media hype to get the majority of people to 'like' bitcoin.
The world has been indoctrinated into thinking - FIAT IS MONEY - it is not, and Bitcoin is NOT money either. Fiat, Bitcoin, gold, silver, etc, are 'types' of money, and different 'types' of money have different properties.
The same as elements are all elements but they have different properties. 
Money is an abstract notion.
Bitcoin is a type of money, same as fiat, fiat is not money in itself.
That is the great lie and the means of control.

2fa is generally enough, someone would need to mug you and grab your phone.
 uses enforced 2fa (email totp)
and optional 3fa (google auth).
Which, if you want, you can get your email sent to 1 phone, and your google auth on a 2nd phone. Then someone would need both phones (in a small time period) and your password and account name.
My personal belief is that every exchange will eventually adopt enforced 2fa like we have.

Turnover. Businesses 'cash in' (convert btc to fiat) to pay wages, bills, etc.
This is sharply followed by all the 'bitcoiners' who have just received wages to converting xxx to btc (e.g. expect a fair rise tomorrow).
Also, most exchanges do not conduct wire transfers over the weekend (a weakness of the banking system). On Monday wire transfers come through/are cleared.
Always expect a relative drop over the weekends, and always just at the end of the month.

Here's an idea.
Offer to pay a % of your staff wages as Bitcoin, IF they wish.
You won't have to convert all your Btc to USD, you'll save more, and you'll spread the Btc economy.
And if value increases (which you're likely in the same boat "yes it will"), then your staff will essentially be getting paid higher wages and will love you for it (and will eventually ask for more % to be paid as btc as the btc economy grows).
Might even want to consider paying part of your own wages in Btc if you're bullish enough.

Apologies, I missed those 4.


You are partly correct in that sentence.
Personally I find the 'risk' is far far less than trusting your fiat to a bank (considering the global economy, monetary inflation and pre-hyperinflation that's going on at the moment). But then risk is a individual perspective, so I can only speak for myself on that, basically, I trust myself FAR more than I trust banks. Others may rightly trust banks more than themselves, this is each persons choice.
Depends where your coins were stolen from. Some businesses have a policy of returning your funds, others do not. And if they're stolen from your own computer, then yes, they're gone, and it could be hard to trace.


Urm ... the whole basis of the OP is WHY (as in, the motivation as to why people use Bitcoins), please re-read the OP to seek your answer in this, though admittedly the OP is directed as to 'why businesses and people use Bitcoin. And my counter argument (just above) points towards WHY people use in countering your 'cons'. Must admit, you really are starting to come across as a trololol.


No offence, but you don't understand how the block works enough. This will never be a problem. I won't go into 'lecture mode' here, but let me try to explain it like this;
30 years ago, commodore's and atari's were the 'top computers of the line'. Obviously I don't need to point out computers now. Do you remember netscape? Do you remember what phones were like 20 years ago? You could beat an elephant with those old bricks.. Do you know what ASIC is? (obviously you do, which makes this question even more trololol).
Basically, things evolve and develop. Yes, if suddenly tomorrow billions of people were using Bitcoin, there would be an issue, but which would be solved over time. Bitcoin is the fastest advancing 'technology' to date, especially with all the VC interest, mhm.


I would truly like to see BFL (or one of the other ASIC companies suddenly receive 40,000+ units of various ASIC units. There are certain reasons why the 51% attack is unfeasible and would be extremely costly, and would only last for a small amount of time and would die costing the attacker a fortune in the process. AND at the same time boosting the Bitcoin economy through the roof ;)
Again, I won't go into lecture mode here, because this is reddit and it would probably take a few pages to explain, maybe I'll do a pdf on it sometime though.
So thank you for your 'cons' as they gave me the opportunity to show how they all fall flat on their faces (though I must also say that some points you made I agree with, as stated).
I STILL encourage you to TRY to write your OWN POST. But being a (probably paid) trololololol it is part of your mandate to 'hop onto any positive posts about Bitcoin and TRY to talk smack about it.
This is the FIRST indication of a troll.
The SECOND indication of a troll is when you tell them to craft/write their own post relying their thoughts and concerns. But they STILL cling desperately onto the 'pro' post trying to 'bring it down'.
However, unless you became capable in making your OWN POST you will be labelled as a TROLLOLOLOL, and granny said don't feed the trolls!

The total Bitcoin market is at roughly $7 Billion (at the time of this posting). It was estimated (with various research pieces which I cba to link here), that 5% of that was on the black market. 
$350,000. And its only that high because spending bitcoin as bitcoin is limited for other things.

 -
Though a risky venture, I applaud you (there's quite a lot happening behind the bitcoin scenes that will come forward in the months to come), basically, lots of things happening that can only increase the value.
Though I suggest you 'play' with some of your bitcoins, invest a little to help startups (after you do lots of appropriate research), and always triple check anything you want to get involved in.
And I also strongly suggest to put another section of your bitcoin aside to SPEND!
This is very important, if you spend some some of your bitcoins then you're helping the bitcoin economy grow, thus strengthening your 'savings in bitcoin'.
They say deflation = hoarding.
I say they lie and that inflation is a poison and causes insane hoarding and the economic mess we're in.
Also, PLEASE make sure you split your bitcoins up, do NOT hold any amount in large quantities than you need to spend (I suggest $1,000 wallets), store your coins in various places and for the majority that you want to use as savings, store in COLD STORAGE, in multiple formats and areas and amounts.
1. invest a little

it depends upon ones attitude towards using btc, as a store of value (for how long?) or as something to trade in with very little (if any) fraud risk (and thus possibly losing out entirely from the seller PoV).
It's value in this instance seems to be along these lines (that the seller won't be dealing with possible stolen credit cards or paypal accounts).
In that, many see great value, and not just the 'hold until infinity perspective' (though I suspect that most people (myself included) keep a little aside for that 'special day').

They sell their Bitcoins (generally at whatever is the lowest for quick sale), but people buy up the Bitcoins.
That's the main thing to consider, the sold Bitcoins aren't going into oblivion, they're being spread out. The more that sells the more users get into it (unless it's just a few buyers ofc, I guess only mtgox and other exchanges knows the true story there).
The sales should hit a bottom wall then climb.
My honest thoughts on this is the constant attacks against mtgox. We're in the time of the 'Rise Of The Exchanges!' (good film title?). In that the Bitcoin user base will hopefully get spread out more across the exchanges.
The US is shooting itself in the foot though, I can see trade going to other exchanges.. or maybe they're not.. their tactics are forcing US mtgox to move to local US exchanges.

Extremely easy to show a record of it.
The fault lies in the system, in that capital gains tax applicable to his bitcoins are reliant on that he 'spent' xxx amount on those bitcoins in the first place.
If he earned those bitcoins as bitcoins (or earned more as bitcoins), then capital gains tax becomes 'complicated'.
In that capital gains tax only really works if the bitcoins in question were ALL brought (with fiat) and then xxx (of that amount) was 'cashed' (converted) to fiat.

or print out btc to paper wallets or usb sticks or cd's, etc, etc, and 90% of 'dollars' (FIAT, damn world is NOT JUST USA!!) will be utterly useless also.
Whilst 100% of Bitcoin will be able to be 'printed' out and/or downloaded/saved in various formats.
Can you do that with your online bank account? No?

People come 'into' the Bitcoin economy for different reasons, what I am trying to say is that **some** people come into Bitcoins because of the thoughts (and as can be seen, some fact) that the value of Bitcoin will increase. In that the Bitcoins they get today might be worth more in xxx given amount of time. I am not sure how else to explain this one...
I totally agree, it is implemented, **to an extent**.
That is the key point, as you mention yourself. If you or me wanted to go and have a look at a Bankers/Politicians wages or Political Parties 'bank account' (maybe for some strange reason we think they've been bribed/corrupted/etc). Then we can not (unless we have a warrant). Bitcoin wallets offer full transparency, to you, me, anyone, we can just go and have a look at whether our politicians/bankers have been fiddling and taking bribes, etc, and/or stashing millions/billions in offshore accounts (BVI cough cough).
So, yes, I agree with your statement. After relevant reason and suspiscion and a warrant. Or, me, you, everyone, can go see wtf the politicians and bankers are really up to with tax payers money and donations, etc.
I state that it would be 'fair to assume', because how else will the system take its taxes? A nation would have to declare a law that forces businesses to identify wage wallets, so that they can tax the wage appropriately. Just like they do with fiat.
I don't mean to be giving an opinion in saying Bitcoin is both transparent and anonymous (if you make it so). I am stating fact, it just is. I'd be happy to explain why/how in further detail if required.

drops like this will happen for a LONG time yet. When btc is valued at £1,000, £10,000, £20,000, etc, etc, but relative drops.
When value increases people spend, and after a little bit, the shops, etc, (or people themselves), turn it back to fiat.
When for the most part you can spend everything as Bitcoin, then these drops will hardly happen. But its anyones guess when that will be :)

There will be no safe place for you to hide your coins. Any exchange contacted will give your IP/info over, especially if LE are after you.
Your IP is trackable now with your reddit post (unless you anonymized it), and judging from the fact you came here to post questions how to hide your coins you never anonymized your reddit posting.
And if you did, then any exchange that gets asked by LE will show transactions and any items you buy will be traced to you.

Yes, they can.
Banks (and other related financial institutions, like credit cards/loan companies) are NOT allowed to sell/buy/trade/loan/short etc, Bitcoin/Litecoin/any other cryptocurrency.
It is still perfectly fine to do a bank wire transfer to another bank. Whether the bank themselves will stop you is another question (they probably will if they realise what you're doing).
As in the UK, as in China;
Gov = YAY Bitcoin is good, trade at your own risk.
Banks = BOOO we hate Bitcoin and will do everything in our power to be an absolute pain in the neck.
What the Chinese government has done is to protect Bitcoin from bank manipulation and boost Cryptocurrency Exchange legitimacy (in china).

As much as I'm impressed by Bobby Lee, I would rather trust the Chinese Government when it comes to matters of the Chinese Government.
I mean ... I simply do not understand why people take Bobby Lee's opinion over the facts of what the Chinese Government actually stated.
It's very peculiar .. a lot people in this subreddit do seriously prefer bad news over good news and hype bad news a LOT out of proportion (or even understanding in some cases).
So ...
When it comes to China's laws and Government - who would you prefer to listen to ..
1. The Chinese Government.
2. Bobby Lee (who is obviously a businessman, though relatively a VERY small business).
(e.g. Bobby Lee is NOT the Chinese Government's spokesperson or mouthpiece).
(and for those that need better clarification - relatively compared to the multi-million and billion $ empires in China, and from China (globally)).
p.s. from the UK
p.p.s. Bets are (with a fair bit of certainty), businesses in China that were accepting Btc/Ltc have *temporarily* stopped accepting it until they either,
1. Figure out if they need to apply for a MSB (or equivilant) licence.
2. Have/are applied for a MSB licence and are now just waiting for it to be returned (it takes a few weeks in the UK, I'm just assuming that the time period is similar in China).

IBWT only re-launched yesterday, don't expect a lot of traffic for a few weeks at least. We need to attract the buyers and sellers, traders on both side. 
As others rightly say in this thread, we need to build up trade and traffic.
The benefits we do offer however, 
* minimum deposit of £5
* No international transfer fees.
* No exchange fees.
* Lowered verification criteria, making it much easier for people to get into Bitcoin. 
* There is a withdrawal fee (Royal Mail, viewable when logged in), but this can be removed by visiting Plymouth.
* Day trading (when there's enough activity ofc).
* Litecoin (for day trading to £ or Btc. By the way, Btc-e &amp; IBWT, have a window open on each and trade away with the ltc/btc/£/usd windows).
We were down for a few weeks (yay, UK banks), but we are back up. Give us a few weeks and customer support and we will become the exchange the UK deserves!

@ OP,
Get a smart phone, get a wallet app. 
Every time someone wishes to pay you in bitcoin, open up your wallet app, type in the amount to be paid, show them the qr code to scan, or wallet address to send to.
Or if you have desktop/laptop connection to the net, bitcoin qt client, type in the amount, it can generate a qr code for you, turn your monitor to face your customer, and get them to scan it.
And then just convert it yourself at an exchange, or sell some back to customers, at the end of the day/week/whenever you feel like.
But most preferably - Find other retailers that you can SPEND your earned bitcoins at, buy stock with bitcoin, go shopping with bitcoin, pay your wages partially/fully in the bitcoin you receive ;)
It's a great experiment, everyone is welcome :)

I would be the first to say it IS biased. But still hits the facts of the matter. I've tried to make it neutral, but factual, as to 'Why Bitcoins?'.
I think it would be rather difficult to NOT be biased when putting across why people are moving to Bitcoins. If I wrote something as to 'Why not Bitcoins?'. Would you class that as biased also?
My point is, its difficult to sound non-biased when talking about the pro's of why people are doing something.

I've kept the letter somewhere, but basically it was a 1 liner.
"Bitcoin is against our ethical policy."

Them: "against our ethical policy." .. 
Me: "can you at least explain why?" (seeing as it fits all their ethical policies)
Them: "urm, yes, its against our ethical policy."
Me: "right...."
After around the 14th bank you kinda go "yawwwn, whatever, I'll keep your decline and when things hit the fan I'll add 'you' to the list of banks that I'lll people which banks they should get their money out of if they have anything to do with bitcoins."

Honestly, you did a great service to Bitcoin. Anyone who gets anyone else does, especially if its a business.
Might I suggest your next step is (you) do some research and find where he might be able to use his bitcoins to buy his normal supplies. If you can find that for him, then you're onto a winner (and so is he!).
Once you're able to feed the chain with just bitcoins .. he'll quickly notice the difference ;)
@_date: 2013-04-17 11:50:16
Anyone legally employed could be legally made to show their 'wage wallet', at this point your bitcoins can be and will be taxed. 
OR, if you are legally employed, your employers business is legally required to identify the wallet that you will be paid into, and to pay appropriate tax on the amount of your wages before it goes into your wallet. - This scenario is most likely as it's easier, less costly and more effective.
IF you are illegally employed (unregistered wallet &amp; receiving payment from a legal corporation/business), then ofc you'd face all the other problems that such a thing would face in the contemporary world.
It is so easy to tax, I don't understand by people get so hung up on this point...
@_date: 2013-09-23 21:36:39
lol good answer :D
@_date: 2013-07-23 08:47:36
heh, some interesting answers. The reason why you (or anyone) shouldn't be worried is because as bitcoins become 'lost' their 'potential' value increases, thus moving into the smaller decimals.
Also, at some point an alternative coin (alt coin) will act suitably as 'bitcoin change'. So, even if, say, 90% of the bitcoins are lost, by that time there would be so many viable alt coins acting as 'change', that it won't matter.
And these alt coins can always do this, forever. Because with the way the protocol works, this is the first time that a monetary supply can be truly 'predictable' (in that its production and quantity can be measured and even chosen).
This way (with a little maths) we can create alt coins to act appropriately as 'bitcoin change' to a certain value (by tweaking the total of alt coins and the rate of supply we can 'shape' its value, but would only be possible in years time IF bitcoin were to succeed that much).
And more alt coins can always be made, add infinity.
Using a monetary system that you can create out of thin air, yet is totally predictable and definable and dependable (so far so good) puts us into a whole new era.

Okey dokey, been having a poke, need to poke some more. But here's some questions.
Where's your other social media outlets? Facebook, Reddit (don't get me wrong, you're doing a great job replying to all here, but I'm assuming you must have a 'Kraken btc Exchange', or similar name ready for reddit?). Bitcoin forum names? (thinking bitcointalk.org, since its the major one).
Obviously 'Kraken' will be taken on sites such as Facebook, but something similar (Kraken Btc-Exchange, etc), and linked to from the exchange site to verify it?
Anyway .. my question/s .. do you have these setup already? If not, will you? 
Also, if not, you probably should grab/setup the names before someone else does and gets the funny idea of selling your own name to you on popular social media outlets.

Technically not 'acceptance' of bitcoins for sale, but for obvious reasons of use to all the businesses here -  - A UK virtual currency exchange, 0.8% fees, faster payment system, currently only bitcoin &amp; gbp (expanding into litecoin and other altcoins and fiat currencies/countries, and higher tier customer individual/business accounts).
Yes it has government approval.
Yes it has a business account.

Offshore banking works perfectly well for UK bitcoin businesses. But in the case of operating an exchange/trading platform, it becomes pointless.
You would still pay the transfer fees, exchange rates, and have to wait for the same amount of time as using and Euro exchange.

1) Buy bitcoins with cash &gt; 2) send coins through a few shared wallets (google it) &gt; 3) make sure you use multiple separate wallets for receiving them in the end &gt;  4) convert bitcoins to fiat under 'bitcoin profit', pay taxes, win.
Or  1 to 3, then don't bother converting them back, spend as much as you can AS bitcoins, and only convert back what you absolutely need (for bills, etc, that you can't pay in btc yet).
Or 1 to 3, buy something expensive for resale (with bitcoin), then sell it for fiat.

I am pretty sure its clear that this piece is trying to explain 'why people **use** Bitcoins'. And not a piece trying to explain 'why people do **not** use Bitcoins.' In which case I would have written the 'cons of Bitcoins'.
Which I did partly explain above, in that in most cases the people/person is question simply doesn't know enough about it yet, not always the case, but is most often the case, which is very easy to tell because they spout lots of things thats **bad** about Bitcoins, but in fact, they're completely wrong and might as well be talking about something completely different.

They should only be asking you if its &gt; $10,000 or &gt; $15,000 (I'm not 100% sure with US law).
Switch bank imho. 
Stop buying Bitcoins with your current bank, keep your current bank account open, make a new bank account with a different bank, start slowly moving all your business and transactions, etc, into your new account. Don't do it too fast, continue to buy Bitcoins with your new account.

1. format your drive.

3. use a wallet on ubuntu for your small spending.
4. store the majority of your coins on cold storage (e.g. save your dat file on a usb stick/cd/external drive, etc, or use a paper wallet).
5. Only ever use your ubuntu drive/wallet for bitcoin spending.
enabling 2fa options will be coming out in future bitcoin-qt versions.
edit: 6. randomly check what programs are running on your computer from time to time, if ANYTHING looks suspicious, take immediate action! (if you have a keylogger/trojan, you'll get the opportunity to send your coins 1 time before they have your access, I suggest send coins to a very safe place 1st if you're suspicious).

Ask them for a wallet address for you to send your Bitcoin taxes in, as you have no way of changing them.
Unless they specifically create a new law that demands all nationals convert any alternative (or bitcoin in particular) currency to local/national fiat denomination. Which I know they havn't, yet.
If they insist you convert without law backing them and for some strange reason you do, then do so at the lowest last yearly rate.

WHAT IS BEHIND BITCOIN?
1.	Lower fees
2.	Lower transactions
3.	No barrier to adoption
4.	Far far easier to adopt than card machines
5.	Cheaper than card machines (from a business PoV)
6.	No overdraft charges (you are your own bank)
7.	A far FAR higher rate of 'room to grow' (e.g. increase in value) than it can decrease.
8.	Does not rely on bank trust (have you looked at the economy lately?)
9.	Does not have 'middle-men' (it is FULLY INCLUSIVE!) 9.1 - no more stolen funds from 'charities' 9.2 - no more massive cuts for businesses and individuals when send money anywhere (to friends or for buying goods) 9.3 - no ability for the banks and corrupt powers that be to STOP your transactions
10.	Banks and governments can not seize your wealth (unless they waterboard you and you give up your password).
11.	Whenever you use your credit/debit card you are GIVING full access to your card details to whoever is on the other side (phone or net), and they can then use your details and spend your money.
12.	Point 11 does not compute with Bitcoin (its impossible).
13.	Bitcoin is HIGHLY fraud resistant.
14.	Bitcoin is very young and has amazing potential to grow and develop (9.0 will be very interesting).
15.	There is a limit to how much you can withdraw from an ATM and/or from your Bank.
16.	There is a limit to how much money (fiat/paper money) you can take with you when you go abroad.
17.	Officials (or anyone) can steal your money whilst you travel, etc.
18.	15, 16, and 17 does not apply to Bitcoin.
19.	Bitcoin is open source!! (extremely important!)
20.	All addresses are publicly viewable!!! (amagad! yes really, imagine if you could see all the corruption in government and official bodies, because you could see exactly who was donating/bribing what and how much).
21.	Imagine, you're in tescos (or a bus, or any other shop, etc), there are huge queues, people are paying with their change, and you're having to wait for credit card transactions to go through. 30 minutes later you finally get served.
22.	Imagine, you're in tescos, etc, there are huge queues, everyone takes 10-20 seconds to pay, because all they have to do is &gt; face phone to screen, push phone (send) button, done.
23.	Taxes. Imagine all the stupidly rich and corrupt (individuals and businesses) could no longer hide all their taxes (freaking government preaches about tax evasion, when really its the millionaires and the corps that do 90% (probably more) of the tax evasion). Imagine the economy recovering from all that wealth coming back into the system.
24.	Accountability. Imagine politicians and those in power being held accountable for their actions.
25.	Inflation (end of). Hyperinflation is incoming, government has lied about inflation for quite a long time. If you really want to see the true rates of inflation look at the value of milk, bread, a chocolate bar, etc, over the last 10 years, that will give you a good example of the true rate. 25.1 - The bitcoin protocol actually has inflation also ('mining'), but at FAR lesser rate (in value) and with a system that steadily decreases over time.
26.	Deflation - Natural deflation is the real state of an economy. Inflation is a lie, and has been used as a tool to control the masses and divert wealth to the extremely few. Bitcoin suffers from natural deflation (which is a VERY GOOD thing!).
27.	Uncontrollable bankers. Banks are too big and corrupt to stop head on, there are way too many politicians in the bankers pockets (and the army).

Extremely easy to show a record of it.
The fault lies in the system, in that capital gains tax applicable to his bitcoins are reliant on that he 'spent' xxx amount on those bitcoins in the first place.
If he earned those bitcoins as bitcoins (or earned more as bitcoins), then capital gains tax becomes 'complicated'.
In that capital gains tax only really works if the bitcoins in question were ALL brought (with fiat) and then xxx (of that amount) was 'cashed' (converted) to fiat.

A UK exchange.
Don't need to pay £10 fees, nor exchange rate fees, and takes 12-36 hrs to verify an account, possibly sooner. Also is much faster to deposit and withdraw as they're with the Faster Payment system (UK banking thing). 
You can deposit/buy/sell/withdraw all within 1 day.

Ignorance. And it tends to be human nature to hate what they don't understand. This is brought about by a governance state of monopoly.
Monopoly states do NOT want things to change.
If things change, monopolies lose their control and power.
All states are monopolies.
Monopoly states (and corporations) try to indicate (most times successfully) that change is BAD.
People don't understand what a Bitcoin nor business or societal implications. A lot of people approach it from different angles, depending upon their specialties or knowledge.
Hence making a post that hopefully addresses most of the common questions as to 'why use Bitcoins'  (and I will edit/put in appropriate additions as people make comments).
As mentioned in the OP, IF your attitude and thoughts towards Bitcoins are "It's a fucking stupid waste of everyone's time and appears to have been named by an 8 year old." Then, again, as mentioned, I suggest that you stay away from Bitcoin and stick to Banks 'looking after' your money.

OF course you couldn't write a new post and had to hijack this one ;) Meaning that you already lost your argument.
Anyway, I took the time to reply to each of your points, enjoy.
1) I was comparing Bitcoin to FIAT, and WHY people have been using Bitcoin instead of FIAT. NOT "Why have people been using Bitcoin instead of other DIGITAL currencies.
To be fair, I did not clearly put "WHY PEOPLE BITCOINS INSTEAD OF FIAT!", hence I blame myself (I really do think you should stick to fiat though if such things were too complicated to understand without being made extremely clear to you).
Anyway - IF I was writing "WHY Bitcoins 'instead of other digital currencies like Ripple'", I would write - because Ripple is essentually centralised, the source code has not been revealed (and is not planned to be revealed until the end of the year, if that), the company gave their employees a vast amount of Ripple AND their own company a vast amount of Ripple, and THEN they released Ripple to the general populace.
2) There are such things as 'CREDIT CARD CHARGES' and 'CHARGE BACK', I simply am not going to explain the world of finances to you, simply put, go look it up. Middle man = excess charges, in some cases there are multiple middle men. Each time this adds charges to the Business, each time it can be blocked, and the 'Middle Man' is a CENTRAL FIGURE (e.g. SWIFT). This means, that the US (or relevant country) can BLOCK entire countries from transactions for economical and political reasons. DID you know that over the last 13 year over 500,000+ children in Iraq have died because of economic sanctions? You talk about killing babies, hows 500,000+ for you? Hence the CON of using FIAT and the PRO of using BITCOIN. There are more children dying every day in other countries than Iraq because of the MIDDLE MAN is forced (or does so willingly under bribes/money) to block them from trade.
Where is your CON for using Bitcoin? I thought you were talking about the Con's of Bitcoin? I fail to see your Con in this point in using Bitcoin.
3) Thousands of Businesses disagree with you. You can go and google/check (blockchain.info as a starter, or Bitpay), and you can see for yourself, AND you can even TRY for yourself. The amount of businesses that do NOT use an escrow using Bitcoin. There IS room for escrow services in Bitcoin (indeed, there will/is be established escrow in the future), for certain matters and dealing with customers you don't trust. BUT, if you actually go and look, all the legitimate businesses using Bitcoin DO in fact have a return policy in play. 
4) You lack a full understanding of inflation. Inflation as you understand it (and as most people have been lied to), is not as you think in all sense. I am sure you will find a lecture on it in due time, but let me try to explain it very briefly this way (as it needs more than just a few lines) 
Monetary Supply Inflation - 3600 Bitcoins are mined daily, lets assume btc value is $100, that is $360,000 worth of Bitcoins mined daily. Now, as per Inflation, they 'devalue' the Bitcoin, thus bringing its value down. THIS is under the assumption that 3600 Bitcoins are mined every day AND sold every day - That the value of Bitcoin is brought DOWN (because of inflation as you say).
Now this is where it hits a problem. Because of the decentralised nature, it is RARE that a miner (we must change this word sometime, it is just a reflective word to help people understand with comparison to gold) (miner = someone who gets rewarded Bitcoin for doing 'ledger work') - It is RARE that a miner gets 1 whole Bitcoin EVERY day, AND even rarer that such a miner sells that Bitcoin EVERY day.
Mining - because of the decentalisation nature, mining pools exist (you'll have to go google/research that one, I won't explain it here). 'Miners' are rewarded Satoshi's (0.00000001), normally in the 10's of thousands, totally dependent upon the individuals contribution to the network - Because of this it can take days, or weeks, or months (heh, I know someone who still hasn't even had 1 whole bitcoin after a few months of mining) - HENCE, it is IMPOSSIBLE for all 3600 Bitcoins mined/produced each day to be sold each day -
As such, the value of Bitcoin does NOT decrease (this is known as monetary supply inflation) relative to the amount of Bitcoin introduced into the Bitcoin economy ($360,000+ per day). This is due to a decentralised nature. 
IF it was centralised, then the Bitcoin producer may very well sell each every day, and even note this down in a central recorder, thus allowing the Bitcoin to inflate as per the monetary supply inflation rules that we have been led to understand.
However, it is NOT centralised - 3600 are produced daily - 1 Bitcoin is NOT given out to each 'miner' - 1 Bitcoin per 1 Bitcoin produced is NOT sold (devalueing/inflation).
Therefore - Bitcoin is immune to inflation.
Price inflation is a different thing, and is not real inflation. Again, please google.
5) &amp; 6) A valid point. I would argue that centralisation (lack of) and decentralisation are such topics that merit separation in their explanation. As there are certain things (as inflation) that can only be explained under decentalisation (see my reply to your 4)), and such things as 'charge back', control, blocks, and similar that can best be explained under centralisation. Essentially they are the same, but it makes it a lot harder to explain things when you lump them together and try to explain both at the same time in the same context.
7) Open source makes it easier to hack? I don't think you quite understand what open source is. And that if someone wanted to hack something it really wouldn't matter whether it was open source or not. In fact, open source makes it MUCH easier to see if there are any faults in the code. On this note, people have tried to hack it, repeatedly, and failed, repeatedly. No, open source does NOT make it easier to hack.
8) Deflation is a good thing. Its the natural cycle of money, inflation must be enforced and is a poison. I'm not going to waste time explaining this in detail. It's very easy to see that you've been blinded by the mass media on this point and you'll learn sooner or later (when the next crash hits), btw, the world is entering the beginnings of hyperinflation, that's your 'expert' economists for you ;D
9) See point 12) (anonymous if so chosen and the effort put in).
10) I put to you, to put a chunk of your wealth (assuming you are wealthy) in a Cyprus bank account. Then go to Cyprus, try to withdraw the majority of your wealth (see how much it limits you), draw money out for a few days, then try to get out of Cyprus with your money. - Bitcoins has no limit.
I put to you to put xxx (assuming its not a tiny amount) money in a Cyprus bank account, then try transferring all your money to an account in a different country with a different bank. - Bitcoins has no middle man to block you.
I put to you to try putting £100,000 (or more, or try it with a suitcase full of monopoly money and just state at the airport "its a suitcase full of money!") in a suitcase and trying to leave your country via commercial airlines. - Your Bitcoins can be put on a USB stick, cd, or paper wallet, or similar.
Then get back to me about 'transportability' (after you get out of prison for trying to smuggle your own legal money out of the country).
11) I fail to see your 'con' in this point.
12) See your own point 9). And please explain 'sorta'? Hm? How would your government trace my Bitcoins through multiple shared wallets? And YES, it can be used by drug cartels, etc, this is an extremely valid point. Maybe one day additions or an idea will come along that will address that problem. 
The thing is .. drug cartels and the 'big' players, use banks, HSBC for starters, as banks legitimize their laundered funds. Bitcoin does NOT legitimize laundered funds. Businesses through Bitcoin, which THEN have to eventually go through a bank. That can work.
Though I should probably point out - the illegal drug market is the 3rd largest economy in the world, roughly worth roughly $434 billion. The Bitcoin economy is just under $1.5 Billion, the amount of illegal activity in the Bitcoin economy is something like 2% and steadily getting lower. So I hope you can grasp an idea of how much money laundering is done through the banks with the banks.
13) There's 1 site in particular, can't remember the name atm, I'll find it later possibly if I get the time. To be honest, this isn't done much, it's something I personally think 'should' be done. Clearly you have NOT read 13a) Please read 13a to understand from a vendor/seller PoV.
But let me try to explain it this way - 
You want a TV that costs $300.
You can wait a month or so, its not a desperate need.
You spend $200 on Bitcoins (getting 2 Bitcoins at the value of $100 each).
After 1 month your Bitcoins are now worth $150 each (because of DEFLATION).
You buy your TV that costs $300.
You only spent $200 buying your TV.
Under INFLATION -
You keep your USD, after 1 months your $200 is now worth $195. You must spend an EXTRA $105 to get your $300.
14) How long does it take someone to setup a new bank account? Days, a week, or two? Wait for the mail, confirmations, etc, etc.
How long does it take to setup a new Bitcoin wallet, roughly 1 day (depending upon the speed of your connection/computer).
I feel at this point I need to remind you that this topic is about WHY people use Bitcoins, NOT why people setup a Bitcoin account. There is a difference, hoping you can see it.
I put to you -










(Yes I copy/pasted this answer from above from answering another person - Sometimes, just sometimes, it HELPS to read what people have actually typed BEFORE you reply to them)
15) End of inflation is a very good thing. I am sure there will be lectures and more information on it in due time. I am not going to explain it here, no offence, but you simply wouldn't understand or be able to grasp the concept (I don't mean to be mean, but I say this from seeing how difficult it has been for you to understand what others have seen as very clear). To explain the various implications of the end of inflation would take a while.
I also feel I should note - That my OP was not meant to EXPLAIN each and every point in DETAIL so that everyone could understand each and every point. It was just to MAKE the points so that people wondering WHY people were using Bitcoin could get a few answers and/or have reference points so that they can seek out the answers themselves.
16) Well, this one depends on your own personal PoV. Whether you like being a slave and having masters such as corrupt Politicians and Banksters, or whether you want to be free and have control of your own money and worth. Each to their own, I won't force you to be free.
Your extra point - again, a PoV, you think Bitcoin is overvalued, many think it is VASTLY undervalued. As to the truth of this, we can but watch and wait and see where the 'Bitcoin experiment' goes.
IF you have the guts/courage to make your OWN POST about the CONS of Bitcoin, then please do so, and let us know. Otherwise its very clear you're just trolling and 'trying' to talk smack about Bitcoin, which you clearly do not understand. It is perfectly fine to not understand something, but try to LEARN if you do not understand, try not to hate and talk smack.
Let us hope you are NOT an obvious TROLL and possibly paid to run around on all Bitcoin related topics to try to talk crap about it where ever you can, and as such we shall see your own post soon? Or are you a paid trololol?




P.s. I never said it was perfect, but I DO imply that it is FAR superior than Fiat.
"I free'd thousands of slaves, you think that was great? Alas, I would have free'd hundreds of thousands more, if only they had known that they were slaves."

Look at  and see the amount of buys vs the amount of sales (in different currencies, I suggest USD, EUR at least), you'll notice there's a lot more people 'buying in' than 'selling out'. Also check   the steady increase, and  the downloads (check each 6 monthly).
The amount of new people coming into bitcoin is still far higher than it was 6 months ago and current media has gone through the 'hate' stage and is now in the 'curious' stage with lots of asics out there and new exchanges on the horizon and vc's and angels.
But ye, some people just need to see it for themselves and all you'll do is waste your breath.

Fractional reserve banking, imagine they do what they do to 1 million people, the interest, etc, they earn on it..
It's just another 1 of the MANY tricks banks use (world over) to steal your money.

I know this, you know this, but the point is, most people don't. And I encourage everyone to tell someone else about bitcoin, and if you can convince businesses to accept bitcoin then all the more power for you.

But then when the value 'shot to the moon' the Bitcoins that you had gained through receiving the mortgage (that you had retained) would make you very wealthy indeed.
Btw, I believe there's places in Canada and some in the US that accept rent via Bitcoin, no mortgage's yet though (as far as I know).

FSA/FCA don't govern Bitcoin either (yet).
VAT still applies.


This is highly recommended.

Yes. It interests more people who can buy 'cheaper coins', so the market keeps on growing regardless :)

An exchange that operates without a bank, outside the banking world. Every other exchange still have a foot in the bank and is susceptible to banks screwing customers.
(currently only UK, but will be expanding internationally, but very likely not to the US).

Dear Senator Moran,
As your brilliant question just brought up. IBWT (UK Based Exchange -  (re-launched today, after UK banks (who hate bitcoin) closed our accounts) - will NOT trade with US customers, individuals or businesses, because the regulations in the US basically block us because they are too harsh!
Losing out on US &gt; UK trade is not a good thing (as you brought up) in this emerging Bitcoin economy.
Companies like Bitpay and other emerging companies in this area, we can't do business with them or similar US businesses because of US regulations ..
You were very right in what you said, and the panel you're speaking too are talking 1 thing BUT doing ANOTHER!
IBWT will be opening up branches internationally - Mauritius, India, Europe and other places as they become available. But not the USA, unfortunately.
