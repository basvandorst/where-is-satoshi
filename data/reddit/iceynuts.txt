Just to be clear, the app is not on your PC.  The Ledger can be initialised entirely offline, just connect it to a USB power pack and you are good to go.

No they are not. Withdrew yesterday and they created an address with exact amount to pay me and the mining fee.

Ledger don't seal their devices.  They are more secure than a Trezor and don't need to be sealed which just gives a false sense of security.

You need to look at the buy/sell rates. It's no good paying no fees if you get a worse rate and I find CB are generally good rates.

I had a 39 sat/B transaction sitting there since the 6th Jan.  It finally confirmed yesterday after 2 weeks!  It just goes to show, if you're not in a rush, wait it out.

Sounds expensive.  As a parallel - £250 of BTC from Coinbase recently.  Less than £10 fees (and only that high due to using a card).  Transferred to hardware wallet for zero cost (via GDAX).

It will cost a lot of bitcoins to bring a body out of cryopreservation.

A wallet is not the same as an address.  Plenty of info on richest addresses.  But anybody with an HD wallet has an unlimited amount of addresses making up that wallet.  And many bitcoin holders will have multiple wallets too, be they paper, software, hardware etc.

Here is the payment to me: 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:32:37
200k out of 51m people.

You may receive a payment there some time, depends what you did with the public key and who you shared it with.  Plus there might be a fork or airdrop that you didn't claim but becomes valuable in the future.

The significant thing here is that the spend comes from the address that Satoshi sent 10BTC to in Jan 2009.  Somebody had emptied that address in Nov 2010 (when Hal says he 'dusted off his wallet' and moved bitcoins to cold storage).  They then decided to empty out some dust 7 years later.  Hence why you never discard old keys.  Maybe Hal's tank needed topping off?

You can transfer your coins out from Coinbase at zero cost.  Deposit them to GDAX (zero cost, in fact they don't even move as your CB/GDAX wallets don't actually contain anything, it is all 'off blockchain' i.e. done on trust and CB hold all the coins in their wallets), then withdraw them to your personal wallet (zero cost to you as GDAX pays the network fees - and as they never even moved to GDAX the actual xfer will come from CB anyway).

The fear is always that this is indicative of a lack of liquidity.  It's how all the big exchange hacks started to become apparent.  Probably not the case here, it just seems that GDAX and Coinbase can't scale to the levels of customers they are currently seeing.
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:36:45
Coinbase sent 0.9, you presumably withdrew the 0.0357.  They got the rest back as change.
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:41:03
You will also have bitcoin gold as well.

Ask yourself how many bitcoin thieves have been caught and prosecuted by blockchain analysis.  Even if the transactions are traced (and they obviously can be) there is no way of knowing who owned all the intermediate addresses.

The day that BTC died (and litecoin, ethereum etc).  I don't see how people can be in denial.  Even if it doesn't contain any 100% illegal images yet, you can bet that Visa will be stuffing it full of images to ensure it gets banned.  People who like buying big dips get your money ready, story is spreading like wildfire on the news sites.

Can you withdraw your currencies or is it just fractional reserve crypto? ;-)
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:15:58
Is he dead then? ;-)

That final address looks like an exchange address?  Currently hold 50 BTC and has received over 9000BTC in total, active constantly.
Can't make sense of most of your post.  You controlled this BIPS address by the sound of it?
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:27:12
Unless you share the xpub all anybody can see is your spend and change address. You could have $1bn in that wallet and they would have no clue. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:13:09
A wallet is not an address. With an hd wallet I can spend and you will have no idea of my other activity or how many btc I have. Coins can also be tumbled or shapeshifted. Until thieves start getting arrested and convicted en masse it is as good as anonymous.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:52:16
No it is not.  You just recover it from the paper seed.  Ledger hardware wallet wipes after just 3 incorrect pin attempts.  It is good, prevents somebody guessing repeatedly.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:39:19
What country is that?  In the UK it also seems that bitcoin ATMs are mainly installed in vaping shops.  And they are apparently mainly used to launder cash.  There's some sort of association can be deduced here!
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:43:37
2 people I trust know where there is a safe that contains keys to 2 other safes, and in those safes are the private keys and seeds to some wallets.  Hopefully we don't all die on the same plane or something :-D
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:07:46
The same way bitcoin has always been valued, how many Lambos can you buy with it?
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:09:02
No it is not about that. The ledger has a bank grade enclave and the firmware is signed and checked on both processors in the device.
@_date: 2018-03-19 07:51:56
Because, despite what many people here say, coinbase is a market leader with a better market penetration and ease of use than the vast majority of crypto exchanges.

Things were obviously bad when the police were involved but you just knew it was serious when Facebook took action ;-)

My nephew will be 6 this week.  He wants 'diamonds and gold' for his birthday.  So I got him a tiny amount of BTC and a physical bitcoin to symbolise it.  I will tell him that it could increase in value by 100x if he waits long enough, and whenever he wants to he can give the coin back to me and redeem its worth.
