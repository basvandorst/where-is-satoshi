It may surprise you that you can have both bigger blocks **AND** layer 2 solutions, which will obviate **centralised solutions** like bitpay, Coinbase and other exchanges.

**BTC is expensive by design. Blockstream wants high fees.**
In a Twitter exchange, Ari Paul, who is a managing partner of BlockTower Capital, said he was “looking forward to to paying $100 for an on-chain Bitcoin transaction in 2025.”
Demeester responded by raising the stakes considerably, saying that for him, **$1,000 per Bitcoin transaction** would still represent value for money.
In early June, when fees were considerably higher, ex-Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director Bruce Fenton said he thought users were “willing to pay $20+,” while **Blockstream’s Adam Back put the figure, like Paul, at $100.**

BTC fees are too variable and inconsistent for real businesses to use.

Please look into **network effects** and **Metcalfe's law**. It will save you a lot of pain and time. The fastest growing and largest networks will reach a critical number of users and other coins doing similar things won't be able to catch up when that happens.

BTC, for a very large number of people, can no longer function as intended. Transactions below $1,000 can now only happen economically via exchanges because onchain fees are above USD $20 per transaction. 
**Effectively, for most people, BTC is centralised around exchanges with AML and KYC requirements.**
