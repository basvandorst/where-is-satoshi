it's a fair point
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:18:26
Because it’s easier for a coin to go from a penny to a dollar than from $10 to $1000. People invest in low coins so they have more. It gives a sense of pride to say I own 10000 xcoin over 0.00001 bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:34:07
we arent arguing, yes it makes sense, especially for new traders to buy cheaper coins. and yes there is room to grow. 
Although. its absolute madness to to value tron at 1000. that would make tron worth around $64 Trillion. that is not happening

you could give me your referral link, transfer the money to a reputable charity. or better yet, a local small homeless shelter in fiat or food and ill join, im looking to get rich but I do make all my rent payments (for now)
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:35:15
Oh yeah it is dumb, but it makes sense especially for newer traders. 
But what I mean is we’ve all seen coins hit a dollar or two a thousand times over, it will happen again and again. I really don’t think many if any of these coins that are say $20-$100 will get even near 1000
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:12:40
I think the idea is one day they won't be unstable like this, we are just all getting in at the prototype. or really the pre-prototype phase. we are trading the coins/tokens in the hope when the products are released, tested well and developed we are ready

Can I turn my months into days?
I didn’t even think I was being that conservative
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:36:35
Bought in 3 months ago and calculate everything weekly/monthly, don’t see the signs
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:06:14
so you're up 70%. dude chill. it will come back or just cut your losses and get out. either way you're a winner
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:11:39
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:53:30
i watched for years and finally got in on it. today was a bit of a loss but still overall im up far more than any other investment i would have done. I just enjoy learning more about it
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:38:12
The first crypto I ever bought. In 2013. The only crypto I ever bought until 2017 :-/
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:03:20
Nope but dips and rises are usual. This is a big one but by far not the biggest yet. In a few days things will level and go up. Hopefully
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:21:23
Dude, I spread your Bets, We have plenty of room to grow. If you can spare a few hundred a month, once you feel there is enough to split up.
40% bitcoin, 20% ether (possible move to eos if it proves itself), 10% litecoin for fast, cheap exchanges. Leave those there. Then take the other 30% to alt coins, research 5-10 other coins e.g eos, iota, neo ripple, sia, lisk.... safe to stick in the coin market cap top 100. 
You will get returns. You may not get 30% a day but your diversifying, when bitcoin goes up, alts go down. When alts go up... well bitcoin, erm usually holds value. But it is very highly likely there will be a crash, these gains are not sustainable. 
I’m up against the usd day to day, 28 out of the past 30 days. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:28:48
im a late comer and got greedy investing in many altcoins, overall it would have been better to leave in bitcoin. 
im holding 50% for the next few years, the other 50% may come out at some point
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:54:56
So would I if I had the media’s attention and as many bitcoins as they do
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:05:18
its going to be really annoying if over the next few years bitcoin does crash and burn. its going to be weeks of "i told you so" from friends and media. 
im up 70% in the last month, when i get to around 200% im taking out my initial investment and some and then holding the rest
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:26:53
If you have 100 spare and it’s not a big deal if you lose it. Then I would definitely put it into crypto. In a month or two it could turn into 200. 
If you had more I can tell you what I’ve invested in and it has been doing healthy returns. I’m almost double after 2 months and I made it quite diverse to try and minimize losses. This did also mean I didn’t get as high returns but 80% up in 2 months, I’m happy. 
My portfolio is 40% bitcoin, 20% ethereum (maybe moving to eos if it proves itself) 10% litecoin for fast transfers, also it’s done very well lately, then 30% well researched promising altcoins. Eos, iota, ripple, einsteinium, steem, sia, xlm,.....
Also ignore the rude comments, everyone has to start somewhere, you won’t be an expert overnight
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:31:15
I would like to propose my bitcoin wallet....
But seriously, good on you, I hope your donations improve the lives of many :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:59:01
40% bitcoin, 20% ether, 10% litecoin, 20% other. Cover your bets
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:06:13
buying back in when it dips a little more?
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:16:58
if you're looking to make a million dollars from 100, you will be either waiting a very long time or investing in an extremely lucky/risky altcoin that could either go up or down 10000%
if you're looking to invest long term and get a better return than any savings account, it is a good investment, bitcoin is down today, meaning people will soon be buying it up. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:12:13
it may not be a long term investment but I am hoping it is.
I do agree it could be a bubble but I don't believe we are near the pop. there will be years ahead
i made a diverse crypto portfolio and i have never had returns like this. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:33:27
I bought weekly the last 3 months. 
Yesterday was the only loss
The media needs to stop scaremongering 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:17:57
noone knows the answer. but you bought low. and it hasnt moved much lately so it is the best time to take the gamble
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:26:29
no problem! thanks for the reply

Look up 42 coin. There’s 42, last I checked it was mor3 than bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:11:28
Excellent article, I am invested, I watched for years always regretting, finally but the bullet 3 months ago and staggered what I could afford to lose each week into bitcoin and altcoins, i totally agree the majority of altcoins are trash but I am a believer some will rise and bitcoin will continue to rise. I see a very volatile month ahead and the main reason for the is the scaremongering from the media. It is toxic, every small dip is a crash, the big dip today is still higher than 4 days ago. 
As for the bubble argument. I agree it will go down, I do not believe we are there yet. I am holding, I do expect 25k minimum this time next year. There are others hot on the heels wanting to take the top spot and I’m sure there will be some huge gains in newcomers.

In my opinion I think a safe bet is 10% per month next year. Obviously some turbulence but as an average and I’m betting it will go a bit higher. Here’s my prediction, total guess but it’s what I believe to be reasonable
Christmas 2017- 11500
January 2018- 14000
February 2018 - 15000
March 2018 18000
April 2018 - 19000
May 2018 - 20000
June 2018 - 18000 - price drop around here because some sort of government intervention, or large sales
July 2018 - 18000
August 2018 - 22000
September 2018 - 23000
October 2018 - 25000
November 2018 27.5000
December 2018 - 30000
The question I keep asking is how high can it really go. Once you’re well into 5 digits per coin and 21 million coins it will all be speculation. I think there will be some huge drops when the big dogs start dumping thousands of coins into the markets at once, hopefully people will continue to buy and trade. To keep the price moving up. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:46:28
Haha I have no idea why. It’s an anomaly. I’d love to make the 100 coin and float it on the markets owning 99 of them and see if anyone buys it. 
I have to be honest I’m a believer of cryptocurrency, I’ve been watching for a few years but only had money recently to invest, it’s a big gamble but I think next year there will be some big gains in this space, bitcoin will still be top but there will be others hot on the heels. 
A lot of altcoins are terrible. I made some big losses early on when I was investing 100 each week on a random coin without enough research, the majority crashed and burned. Now I’ve left the 20 dud coins and taken it as a loss. If they rise then great, and left the rest in the main ones I think will rise, bitcoin, ethereum, lite coin, ripple, einsteinium, sia coin, primecoin.....
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:16:44
So the crashes are all over the news now, I was a latecomer into the Cryptocurrency markets, I’ve watched it for a few years but only had the money spare to invest for the last 3 months. - I’m holding.
It really bugs me seeing news articles scare people it’s a crash, it’s a bubble, it’s a fraud. that it’s crashing and never coming back. These media outlets hhave so much power to control the markets, they want a disaster so they have something to write about.
Whenever someone “predicts” a crash they then write follow up articles feeling smug about themselves when generally it regained the value in a matter of hours. 
It’s a volatile area to invest in, there will be gains and losses hourly. The thing is, this is the biggest crash in a while and has not dropped below the price 4 days ago. Then look a week, a month and a year ago. 
I think it will continue to rise along with some of the alternative coins. I would say 10% per month is not unreasonable. I’m hoping for 25-30k this time next year. 
For anyone taking risks on other cryptocurrencies, please research thoroughly and check the volumes, I have small amounts in 22 alt coins, 15 of which crashed severely and 5 of them have about a dollars worth of trading each day meaning I can’t get rid of them. It’s a learning process and like a hobby, I lost a few hundred dollars to realize the established coins are the most reliable
The hard thing is on exchange markets everything is in relation to bitcoin, as it has risen so dramatically this year a lot of smaller coins have not kept up.
Is it too late to invest now?
In my opinion, there will not be astronomical price increases like the past two years but the value will still increase dramatically. better than any savings account or most stocks. there has just been a dip so the price is low, if you felt you missed the boat, the time is now. 
Remember with any investment, be cautious and only invest what you can afford to lose, if you’re worried about the current volatility, stagger investment over a number of weeks to minimize the chance of losses.

Sorry, I just bought a small amount so expect it to keep halving until I sell.

Just bought a small amlint. Enjoy the coming dip

It won't be topping 5300 anytime soon, that's my buy in price and probably what's held it there
