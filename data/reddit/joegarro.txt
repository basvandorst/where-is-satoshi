Coinbase is making a killing.  They should beef up the infrastructure. They should lead by example but the current situation translated into bad experiences.  People will remember and will jump unless Coinbase starts being proactive.

Thanks for sharing this. I used to bank with Chase a long time ago. I am not a fan of Chase. I will stay away.

It is a time to enjoy the holiday. It is a time to take a break, reflect on what a great year, and plan for a greater time ahead.

So are Christmas lights during holiday season and all parades during the year. The actual printing of Money is more wasteful of resources. Mining actual precious metal and oil are more harmful for the environment while consuming huge amount of combustion. Times Square needs all that brightness? Cryptocurrency mining has a meaningful  purpose.
