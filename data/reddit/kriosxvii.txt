Money is just a quantity that is convertible into actual goods, services, and shares of companies. Capitalism, and I don't mean consumerism, works because it's profitable to invest in actual things: the means of productions. Stocks, while they can be seen as speculation tokens by daytraders, are shares of actual corporations and factories. If it's more profitable to just hold your currency because it's deflationary, then no investment in actually physically productive things happen. People just hoard, or hodl if you prefer. Why would I buy a share of Apple if I can just wait and have my money be worth more than the profit from Apple?
In the current system, money starts noticeably devaluing if you keep it in a checking account for 10 years plus. But you're not meant to keep your money under a pillow or in checking account for 10 years. At the very least, you can get shit bank interest rates, and protected investments that will beat inflation at 2%. If you want to take risks, you can get stocks, or index stocks. But it's not a very large risk, as capitalism is made so that the house (the stock holders) always wins compared to the people who just work for money. Buying very diversified index funds is betting that the house will win. 
And yeah, I want to compare return on investment between Bitcoin and stocks over the next 20 years. I'll put my money in index funds and the like. You buy Bitcoin. We compare returns on holoreddit 2037. Protip, in a fight between value/index investing and speculation, statistically speculation loses. Assuming capitalism is still standing as an economic system, I'm very confident I'll win this bet.

@_date: 2017-11-27 21:58:14
Fractional reserve fiat money is normal money. Money is created by the banks through debt. 
Bitcoin is acting more and more like this due to a few factors:
-Bitcoin price going up immensely, with relatively small volume of actual sales at its latest ATH price. 
-Lack of exchange regulation and oversight, culminating in outright exchange scams and fake bots (the MtGox classic).
-Wash trading. 
All off this amounts to: there's not enough actual USD in Bitcoin to account for the inflated "market cap". A bank run would fuck everything up as the exchanges run out of actual money. When things get that bad with IRL banks, governments step in and bail them out. There are no bailouts with Bitcoin (except Tether, which might be a disguised bailout), so a mass withdrawal would lead to collapse.  As long as mostly everyone HODLs, a few people with some disposable income invest a few 1000$ in BTC from time to time, and you can still buy drugs on the darknet with it, it probably won't collapse to zero. 
To summarize, while the real life finance system has crashed before, government intervention and regulation are present to lessen the effects and kickstart the economy again. These mechanisms are utterly absent in Bitcoin, by design. 
As for the value of Bitcoin, there's simply no way to evaluate it. Its price is solely due to the greater fool theory, discouting the effects of manipulation. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:56:33
So does any investment, up to and including Bitcoin.
Investing in diversified funds and index funds is basically the closest thing to ethical market capitalism.

@_date: 2017-11-20 01:36:56
Stop looking just at the charts and technicals.
These companies are real companies with real world assets. They produce actual goods (cellphones, computers, softwares, etc), and if they went bankrupt they would have real estate and equipment to liquidate.
That's not the case with Bitcoin. Bitcoin as little to no book value, and its price is dependent is solely dependent on supply vs demand, plus the effect of any shady market manip. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:45:09
Yeah, for six months now? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:33:17
An investment in BTC is not an investment in blockchain tech. Blockchain tech is open source and any future more useful implementation than Bitcoin would not increase the value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:41:45

@_date: 2017-11-28 19:25:12

@_date: 2017-11-20 02:12:22
I don't care about being downvoted, people here need to learn about the basics of investments. I'm not an expert in any way, but still, this is pretty easy to figured out. 
Tesla might still be a bubble. It's P/E (price/earning) ratio is over 1500. This is trash, it means it's solidly overhyped at the current price... but it might be worth it if you believe the company will experience a boom in the long run.
 For a boring, solid, profitable, established productive company like coca cola, P/E is generally around 20-30. 
However, both have actual assets and IP that have value. Not just price.
Gold also has some inherent value. It's used to make jewelry that never oxidizes, as well as electrical contacts and parts in electronics. It's an actual physical thing, though I personally don't invest in gold. Its inherent value is still inferior to its price, but it's had a high price for over 5000 years now and it probably won't crash overnight.
There is zero such safety for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:18:57
How do you know that the money is exponentially higher than issued tethers? Crystal ball?
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:09:50
I can invent a token with exponential growth and artificially limited supply like Bitcoin. It doesn't make it valuable, if it's not useful.
Dollars are useful and will be useful except in case of mad max level society collapse, in which case no amount of retirement planning will be useful.
By the way, usually in a retirement fund you hold as little physical dollars. If you want safe investments, you get a % of bonds or the equivalent, to at least offset inflation. If you want growth (and risk) you get mutual funds and stocks.  Professionally designed portfolios have both. Some stocks are by definition very diversified (broad, international index funds with 1000+ stocks, for example) and less risky. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:34:17
This is literally comparing oranges to apple trees. GWP and GDP are a recurring number. That kind of value is produced every year. Bitcoin just stays the same but inflates in price. It's best compared to a foreign currency than GDP or a stock. 
Market cap is also a trash indicator for Bitcoin. There's much less liquidity going around in the exchanges and the market than the "market cap" seems to suggest. It's actually more like fractional reserve fiat money. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:52:17
Oh, the stock market can crash for sure. But there are still real assets underneath it all. If I buy at 2$ per share a stock for a company that's worth a book value of 1$ per share, I shouldn't lose more than 50% unless there's an Enron-level fraud in there. If you try to sell your shares of a good, working company, you can probably liquidate them all without lowering the price to book value. 
Bitcoin's market cap is a fun number, but fictional. Most people are hodling or margin/daytrading in the hopes that it goes up forever, not withdrawing. So, an enterprising individual or group just needs to buy a few ""million dollars"" worth of coin on the exchanges to get past any sell walls and it bumps the market cap by a few """billion dollars""". 
Bank runs can be lethal lethal even IRL with established financial institutions. A bank run on bitcoin would deflate its price beyond repair, if people were even able to cash out of the exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:23:31

@_date: 2017-11-20 02:24:22
I'm not talking about buying money here or endorsing the current fiat/fractional reserve banking system, I'm talking about buying shares of a corporation which has actual physical assets.
As long as the economic system you're in is vaguely capitalistic, cars, food, fuel, tools, a building, IP, etc, are worth some amount of the current exchange medium/currency, wether that's Bitcoin, USD or bottle caps. That's value. When you invest in an actual company, or a basket of companies through an index fund, that's what you're buying, and that the type of investments I believe in. 
Now, if you're cynical, you might want to avoid corporations  you think are based on bullshit, like finance, hedge funds, or some that might tank in the near future like petroleum companies. 
But still, when you buy a stock, you're buying shares of an actual physical company, not just speculation tokens. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:10:13
Well, commodities have a base value. Food, metals, construction materials, oil, energy, have value.
So it's a currency, I guess. Its price is based on trust and what people are willing to pay for it. It's literally a fiat currency, except instead of a government-backed guarantee that it can be used to pay taxes and purchase goods within its territory, what you have is the proof that someone, somewhere mined a coin through cryptographic processes, and then it found its way to you through a chain of transactions.
Bitcoin is a currency, late comer to the fiat currency game. Its advantage compared to other fiat is the fact that its electronic records are almost impossible to falsify. 
Is it priced at multiple thousand dollars right now? Apparently,
Is the value of this record keeping system equivalent to thousands of dollars per token? Jury's still out.

Bitcoin isn't really that great at security.
It has tight cryptographic security, true. 
It's secure when you keep your coins in your wallet, as long as you don't lose the keys to a virus, bug, scam, alzheimers, dead hard drive, phishing or otherwise.
But there's significant security risk in all the implementations. Exchanges come and go, get hacked, perpetrate exit scams and move to Hong Kong under another name.  
I'm not a fan of the current economic system, at all. But still, right now, my bank accounts are insured by the canadian federal government. If the government financially collapses to the point where they can't insure that anymore, well, it won't matter anymore since I'll be fighting raiders in the wasteland. 
If my credit card gets frauded, I call my cc company and they void the charges and send me a new one. If someone fraudulently cleans out my retirement account, my bank is gonna cover for me. All these financial institutions analyse and plan for those types of risk. Bitcoin is strictly libertarian and far west like. For a little metaphor, Bitcoin is a really secure, impossible to crack cryptographic safe, but robbers can still steal the entire safe (your computer, your password on your cloud storage accounts), or mug you on the way between your safe and where you want to spend your money.

Don't just look at charts.
I can't repeat it enough. Tesla is an actual corporation that owns real estate and equipment and produces cars and solar panels which it sells for money. 
Bitcoin's price is only dependent on the balance of money in vs money out + manipulation.
If you buy Tesla stock now, you get a share of all of Tesla's profits and increase in value and price until the day you sell.
If you buy a bitcoin, you get a bitcoin. It may increase in price if more people keep wanting bitcoins and paying higher prices for them, but in the meantime, it's not producing anything. There's no underlying asset.

Well video rentals are one counter, but we're not about to stop requiring food, materials and energy in the next millenia or so. You can also invest in whole-market index funds that greatly mitigate the risk of any particular sector tanking, with the intent to hold for 20+ years.

I know the type of "disruptive technology" argument you're going for, but still, that's a bad comparison. You're describing value producing companies who happen to have a lot of immaterial assets, like Facebook's algorithms, marketable big data and userbase. Netflix's catalog of entertainment, it's licenses, the TV shows and movies it owns and it's easy to use app. But still. those companies provide services and get revenue from it. It's possible to calculate what they're actually "worth". If they make more money year to year, get new customers, etc, that's verifiable growth that translates into increased value and then increased share price. If Bitcoin was a tried and true stable currency, then you'd want to buy shares of a mining company instead of buying Bitcoin itself, as the mining company produces something (Bitcoin), gets transaction fees paid to it and hopefully makes profits. This makes it a productive asset. Buying Bitcoin is just forex speculation.
Bitcoin might have the potential to be disruptive, but it has no mechanism for producing it's own value. It does, however, have mechanics for increasing its price: supply and demand, and speculation.

You're describing casinos and finance, which are nothing new.

It's literally taking money from fools and giving some of it back to the winners. Only the house always profits.
Bitcoin has the largest supercomputer network? Of ASICS which can do nothing else. And it only needs said supercomputer network cause it's purposefully inefficient. If you just want a safe transaction network, you need only a sliver of the processing power. Except here, they wanna be decentralized, and the only way to do that is to ensure that's it's inefficient and expensive enough that no one is gonna invest to run 51% of the hashing power.
It doesn't give Bitcoin value. The mining corporations have some verifiable value. They own (highly specialized, hard to repurpose) hardware and often real estate to house it.
Bitcoin is a very risky speculation token, and perhaps a currency in some cases. It has some brand loyalty, sunk cost fallacy and first mover advantage going for it, but it's still not a value producing asset, and has little inherent value.

Governments aren't really trying to regulate Bitcoin yet.

Yeah, the current system sucks in many ways. Capitalism doesn't mean if you work hard you get rich. It means if you own capital, you get rich.
But Bitcoin doesn't actually solve any of that. Even when it's going to be mature and integrated in the system, it's just a currency, not a paradigm change. People see it as an investment, or other form of capital.

Yup, they should be comparing it to foreign currency exchange rate charts.

That's hard to say. Unlike a standard stock, BTC has no book value based on underlying assets such as buildings, equipment, etc. So, when the price on the exchanges reaches 8000$, doesn't mean someone literally paid 8000$ x 16 million Bitcoin or however have been mined at the time.
It just means that some people paid 8000$ at least once, and that there are sell and buy orders around that range. I can't dispute that there are multiple million dollars in circulation that people have paid for BTC over the years, but still, the market cap that's quoted around 100+ billion for BTC is largely overrated. People didn't pay 100+ billion cash dollarss for BTC. They paid whatever they paid at the start. 1$, 10$, 100$, 1000$ per coin, and now since someone paid 8000$ for one, they're all theoretically worth 8000$.  
Since there's no book value, and exchanges are pretty opaque, it's really hard to verify truly how much fiat money has been spent on BTC.

Well I wish you the best of lucks. 
I have no stake in Bitcoin failing, but I am indeed concerned (and not concern trolling) about the echo chamber effect here and the easy, unsubtantiated answers that are given to criticism of fundamental aspects of Bitcoin.

It's a problem that the price is increasing because the price is increasing because the price is increasing. People expect the price to increase because the price has increased before. They don't expect to use their Bitcoins to buy stuff. They just want the price to increase, to inflate their on-paper wealth.
This is a very dangerous setup for a bubble deflation.

I don't buy gold either. Don't read my post as a strong endorsement of gold. But it does have some (not a lot) inherent value.

Well, if your savings are in a dumb, cash savings account.
ETFs, diversified stock portfolio, heck even bonds, act as a hedge against inflation and, unless capitalism fails to do what it's supposed to do, which is make the rich richer, will actively grow your investment faster than inflation.
If you bought 0.65 cents$ of a 1972 S&amp;P 500 index fund, you now have 2,65$ in 2017.

Well TBH I'd liquidate over half cause say, 1.5 actual million dollars today, then invested in a traditional investment like an index fund at 4-8% yield per year, is enough to retire instantly and live off of forever. 
So, I'd liquidate most into actual money and keep like 25 bitcoin or so as a bet. If it ever reaches 100 000$ you're even richer. If it tanks to 100$, well, fuck you, got my early retirement anyways.

"They got Al Capone for tax evasion, they'll also get you." is sage black market advice.

Except it also has disadvantages over fiat currency. Fiat currency is accepted everywhere within its jurisdiction and convertible into other types of currency.
Bitcoin's feature of making early adopters into multimillionaires for no particular reason is also very dubious. I get that there has to be a mechanism to issue the initial coins without a centralized authority, but the wealth granted to early miners seems arbitrary and completely unfair, for a system which is supposed to replace normal money all over the world.

Can y'all stop with the market cap crap?
Bitcoin's "market cap" doesn't mean that people paid 150 billion actual dollars for Bitcoin.
As long as you crush the sell orders on an exchange at place a buy at say, 10000$, you're raising the "market cap" of all bitcoin by multiple billions while spending a few "million" at most.

Bitcoin isn't anonymous if you get identified on the inputs and outputs of your wallet.
It, by feature, has a perfect paper trail of everything that ever happened. If you want to be anonymous, you basically have to buy from localbitcoin it another city while wearing a ski mask and not giving out your name.

Yes. When gold gets more expensive, the companies get more profitable. 
But gold itself gets more expensive due to supply and demand and market madness, not due to industrial use. So it's not necessarily a good bet.

Microsoft doesn't just have public confidence. 
It has a captive market. Most corporate offices on the planet use Microsoft products like Windows and Office, and they buy the new versions periodically. This is basically guaranteed earnings, unless there is a major paradigm shift literally everywhere.
