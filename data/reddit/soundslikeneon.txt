How do you manage to buy all of the bitcoins mined on 1 chain?
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:32:38
Ok so you would have to find pools that combine to majority hashing power, and want your money more than they want bigger blocks. Then convince them individually to go along with your plan.
Why would the miners take that risk? Sell to one unknown guy for an unknown period of time at the risk of ending up with bitcoins that only exist on the minority fork...or just go along with everyone else and sell to anybody. That just doesn't work out how you are expecting.

I took kwanijml's comment as a caution against giving a single team of developers too much control over the protocol and encouraging separate projects like btcd. That's only tangentially related to op's concern that this specific change being proposed by blockstream is good for that company and bad for the community but it's a very important point. If there are multiple clients that need to interoperate, blockstream wont be able to change the protocol just by adding a feature to their project. As it stands now, if 50% of the network is running the same client and blindly installing updates, then the owners of that client are the de facto owners of the protocol.

You're really missing the point here. It's not frontend only code, the server-side code is just hosted by coinbase so people using the app don't need to so the server-side stuff themselves. Coinbase form, in an iframe, in whatever single page app you want. As a site owner you get verification the same way you would for paypal, in an email from coinbase or on your account page within coinbase's site.
This is how so, so many web apis work. From paypal payments to Facebook likes, just put secure code in an iframe hosted on the domain of the company providing the service. You don't need to worry about what coinbase does they just provide a way for users to say, give this money to that guy and here is the order number.

This makes no sense. PayPal does it, Google does it, amazon does it, what is so different here?
Coinbase should be able to make a "frontend only" (for the person using the plugin) payment API similar to how paypal does. Host the invoice forms on the coinbase domain, and deal with security there where you can rely on coinbase's own backend for the private stuff. Doesn't coinbase already have a mechanism to pay to a coinbase user by email address? So we are done. This is a reasonable amount of work from coinbase and I'd be surprised if they didn't get around to doing it some time soon.

False analogy is a fallacy. You claim that people who are interested in bitcoin should know better than to blindly trust their employer. Even if this made sense (it doesn't, the company had nothing to do with bitcoin), your analogy just doesn't work. Bitcoin as a protocol has trustlessness built into it at the core, employer/employee relationships are not negotiated via the bitcoin protocol or anything close to a system that enables trust-free interactions. The two simply cannot be compared.

The OP is the author of a drop-in JavaScript solution for online carts. Not having server-side code in a js plugin like this does not mean the developer using the plugin has no server. It means the plugin can be used regardless of your backend infrastructure. Whether you use python or ruby or php or wordpress or just serve static files, this js plugin will work because it has no backend requirements.
Yes, this kind of solution is not for everyone but it can be useful and I'm glad it exists. Yes bitcoin allows people to be their own bank but it also allows companies to participate in an open platform on behalf of their customers. Like email, we all benefit from it being open for anyone to participate, but we do not all run our own email servers. Some can and do, others might try for educational purposes or to fulfill a curiosity, but most defer to companies to handle the technical bits for them because it is complicated and risky and those who are not technical simply don't care to learn. This is fine for bitcoin and email because it is non-coercive, people still have the freedom to decide how they make use of the technology and who, if anyone, they choose to trust in the process.

If you have ever clicked one of those "pay with paypal" buttons you should be able to imagine how this works. Either you get redirected to paypal or paypal gets opened in an iframe.

Ill phrase it this way: if you are using a personal computer to move 60 btc then it should be the kind of computer that has never had browser extensions installed on it, or anything else that isn't fundamentally necessary for moving that money. Maybe disabling extensions would have helped *in this case* but by the time you figure out what is enough it's going to be too late.
People need to wake up to the fact that bitcoin radically changes the nature of computer security and malware. Never before has it been possible to literally rob someone of cash just by writing software. Do you think your bank moves cash around in whatever Lexus the manager happens to drive? Nope, armored god damn trucks.

This is not so true. The difficulty changes every 2016 blocks. If the time between blocks is exactly 10 minutes then this means the difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks.
So if miners stop *abruptly* then there could be problems. If half of miners quit on the same day, the difficulty will not adjust right away. Instead the time between blocks will double and it will take even longer for the next difficulty adjustment.

OP please delete this post, it is giving people a very dangerous misunderstanding of what it means to have &gt; 50% of the network's hashing power.
Bitcoin works with the rule "the longest blockchain is the correct blockchain". This is how forks are resolved and how the network comes to consensus on which blocks to orphan and which to work off of.
When an entity controls &gt; 50% then they *magically* control 100%. Why? Because they can ignore all blocks that they did not mine and still make a longer blockchain than everyone else combined.
There is always a risk of certain types of attacks, like you say. But an attacker with &gt;50% hashing power can completely destroy the network. They can choose which transactions to include in blocks, they can prevent all transactions from going through, they completely and totally own all useful aspects of the bitcoin network, so stop talking like this is about double spends and delete this misleading post.

Don't credit card companies also charge a fixed amount, like 2% + $0.50?
If I pay $10 with a credit card then the fees would be something like $0.20 + $0.50 which is 7% of the price I paid. I see $5.00 minimums a lot which would mean 12% go to fees under this scheme.
So maybe 1-12% would be a more accurate estimate but it isn't lower.
@_date: 2014-01-18 20:34:36
This is misleading. A quick glance at this would suggest (I think to many people) that 23% of addresses contain more than 1000 btc. Obviously that is not true. Instead it shows that 23% of btc are in large addresses. This seems like it overrepresents large addresses and dramatically underrepresents the large number of addresses with dust.
So now that I understand what this is showing, why do you present the data this way? Is this kind of measurement common in economics or network theory or something like that? I think your second link in the comments which shows the proportion of sizes of wallets gives a MUCH more clear picture of bitcoin distribution.

There is a difference between the Bitcoin protocol and the Bitcoin software that implements the protocol.
You can think of this like various chat clients. I can use gchat the service through a number of different clients (adium, pidgin, gaim, etc) just like I can use it on google's own site. If I don't like a change they make to their client, I can switch to different software but keep my screen name and contact list.
What is being argued here is that we need many different projects that implement the same Bitcoin protocol. These would be interoperable and all participants would contribute to the exact same blockchain. But in this set up we avoid having the entire network running the same software that is controlled by a single group of developers. If one project does something the community doesn't like, people have options to use different software with minimal impact on the network itself.

Higher chance of two miners finding a block within the time it takes to propagate those blocks. This leads to more orphans.
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:41:57
I think the real takeaway is that the block size and target block time have a variety of effects, so there won't be optimal settings unless everyone agrees on how much they value each of the factors.
Very roughly speaking:
* time between blocks impacts orphan rate, time to first confirmation, and (with block size) the amount the blockchain can grow over time.
* average network speed between miners impacts orphan rate and helps inform ideal time between blocks if the goal is minimize orphans.
* block size impacts total number of transactions allowed each day
* cost of hard drives impacts ideal block size insofar as we don't want to arbitrarily prevent clients from downloading the full blockchain simply because it requires an entire $100 hard drive.
Etc, etc.
If you just use btc to buy coffee, you want fast confirmation, unlimited transactions, and low fees. If you think btc is best as a replacement for gold that is decentralized you want a small blockchain. If you're a miner you want low orphan rate and a small blockchain, and maybe a large number of transactions once fees start making a difference to your bottom line.
So I don't think there is a single optimal set up here. There are resources like disk space and network bandwidth. 1mb every 10 minutes is a compromise struck with all of these values and tradeoffs in mind.

No offense but you need to rethink your concept of security. No one is saying they don't trust the crypto itself, but we recognize that pure math is NOT the only thing between an attacker and your money. "Endpoint" (eg your laptop) security is still abysmal, and bitcoin only makes attacks on home networks that much more profitable. I'm not betting thousands of dollars that I'm not going to have a keylogger or other malware on my computer at some point in my life.

Bitcoin relies on cryptography in order to work around the need to trust people or institutions.
Edit to add: I do not think the fundamental goal of cryptography is privacy, but rather eliminating the need for trust. I can encrypt data so that I do not need to trust the messenger. I can encrypt data (by signing) so that the recipient does not need to trust I am who I say I am. And I can encrypt data so that I can prove that know something without needing to trust that others won't take me idea....and so on..

I'm fascinated by the fact that through bitcoin users are able to store specific values exclusively on their computers. If my laptop gets hacked and some credit card data gets stolen, I'd have a hard time saying how much that cost me exactly. With bitcoin, you steal 1 bitcoin right now and there goes exactly $773.00.
I bring this up here because I wonder if this ability to assign a *specific* value to bits on a computer will finally get "the masses" to wake up and deal with their fucking endpoint security. Our computers are for the most part woefully, hilariously, shamefully broken when it comes to security, and still nobody (amongst these masses) cares. So I hate to be that guy who's thinking yeah that'll teach em...but come on people, fix your shit already.
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:12:20
Yours is the narrow vision. The blockchain doesn't need to scale in the sense that everyone needs to store a local copy. It's entirely possible for public third-party mirrors to serve this role. And since anyone with the disk space is free to participate, dishonest nodes have a smaller impact and are quickly remedied by honest ones. And the truly paranoid are free to run their own copies.
By analogy, this would be like if your Bank released the source code for its website and allowed you to run a local copy if you weren't comfortable logging in to theirs. Oh and they also provided you with safes and ATMs that you could install in your home.
The point of decentralization isn't necessarily making every single person a full node. The point is that participation is free and open to anyone without needing permission first, and making sure those semi-centralized parts are spread out and interchangeable.

Mining is decentralized, can be done non-cooperatively, and anyone at all is free to compete for coins/transaction fees. In this sense miners do not really form a 'party'. Consider that you cannot participate in a credit card network in order to get some portion of the fees. Though you're right that we do all rely on each other to keep the wheels turning.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:03:29
The major issue here is that doing anything to keep financial transactions private against an adversary like NSA will be construed as money laundering. It is money specifically that has this problem. I can legally use TOR to "launder" packets of data. If I do the exact same process of routing and obscuring money then I could have big legal troubles ahead of me. As far as I know, money laundering is laundering even if nothing illegal was done to get the money nor anything illegal is done with the money. It's laundering simply by the act itself.
Now, if bitcoin had some built in mechanism to thwart the tracing of transactions through the blockchain, then the mere use of bitcoin could be deemed money laundering. This would be terrible for bitcoin since it would shrink its market to strictly criminal activity.
Typically I have little to no faith that governments will make positive, forward-thinking policies that will protect my rights and liberties. I know that if I want to keep data private, I cannot wait for policy to make spying illegal, I need to encrypt everything I can. I know if I want to keep my metadata private, I need to use TOR or something similar. None of that is illegal for me to do. But if I want to keep my financial transactions private...my options are voting and waiting.
