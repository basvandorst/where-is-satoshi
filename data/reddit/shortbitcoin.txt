I love bitcoin stress tests, because Bitcoin is so butterfly-fragile, and so constipated, it obviously will burst at the seams without anybody hardly to do anything.  
If it passes with flying colors, we won't see the price go up, but if you can just stress the network enough I think we have justification for a good dip. All of this is good for the shorts. 
So stress away!!!

I'm in "that camp" — the camp that sees government expansion of the money supply as an evil of the modern word, and advocate a sound money that can't be controlled by banks and government.
However, I don't want to do anything with bitcoin, or dogecoin, or litecoin, because these are not "sound money" in any stretch of the term.  Let's compare them, shall we?
Gold is 100% anonymous, bitcoin is the opposite of anonymity. 
Gold is valuable for a reason (material uses, industrial applications, dentistry, jewelry, etc.) Bitcoin is only valuable because of a speculative bubble — which is to say, it is valuable for no reason at all beyond the greater-fool-theory.
Gold can not be reproduced endlessly.  There's a limited supply of it within our reach and the demand is high. Cryptocurrencies can be produced out of thin air *ad nauseum.*
If Bitcoin is gold 2.0, then I'm not upgrading.

Let's analyze this statement in a bit more depth:


Other sentences of equal stupidity:
"Apple stock went up today and their new product is still months away!"
"The economy is already improving, and Trump's inauguration is still months away!"
"The crops are growing, and the virgin we sacrifice to Huitzilopochtli is still months away!"
Can you not see this?  Have you ever heard the old quip that correlation does not imply causation? Then did you ever stop to think that if you replace causation with something that *hasn't even happened yet* is doubly idiotic?

@_date: 2015-06-28 08:14:35
Thank you for seeing so clearly what went over my antagonists' heads.
I didn't slight Bitcoin; I paid Bitcoin a high compliment. (Admittedly, a bit on the snarky side, but hey, let's try to not be too euphoric, OK?)
Ever meet a drug dealer who accepts Visa or Mastercard?  How about paying for stolen jewelry with a cashier's check from Chase Bank?  Can you sign your US Treasury bond over to an prostitute?  How about paying a hitman by telling e-Trade to transfer 1000 shares of Apple over to his account?  In those worlds, value is traded for value. Stacks of greenbacks. Pounds of Krugerrands.  Weapons.  Things with obvious undeniable value in the world we live in. And I cannot argue, some people place Bitcoin on that list.
It was *not* sarcasm when I said "a marriage made in heaven." The idea has merit. If there was some way for seeders to be rewarded with bitcoin, it could change the whole playing field.  Right now, seeders get nothing more than the warm fuzzy feeling in their heart they are helping the network. (Or they are in a "club" where seeding is required.) Imagine if you seeders could make just a *pittance* for transferring a file! Suddenly that file that took 10 minutes to download takes 30 seconds.

Yes, I realize that. Once a month I get hit up with some chargebacks, all at the same time.  I must have money in my account on the 1st of the month to cover it, else I lose my good standing with Visa.
I sometimes look at the chargebacks, because the merchant gets to see a LOT of information. Not only do I see my charges but I get to see the customer's entire bill (or at least the relevant page or two). I know it sounds nutty, but that's how it works.
And you know what I find?  99% of the time a chargeback is not a dissatisfied customer, but rather somebody who got their credit card hacked. I see my website, five porn websites, a game download charge, etc. etc. All from presumably a 68 year old man in Kentucky! 
I am very happy to give the guy his money back, and it the charges were irrevocable it would be chaos. Without the chargeback process, *nobody* would ever own a credit card, it would be too risky.

Technology doesn't work that way. In the 80s we were using BBSs and non-Internet networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. These technologies were not altered to fit our needs, they were *discarded* as new technologies replaced them.
Bitcoin too will be discarded, and replaced with something scalable. This will be great news for cryptocurrency advocates, but bad news for Bitcoin investors.

I am a huge fan of Schiff but when I hear him speak about bitcoin his ignorance is unmistakable.  
Most of his anti-Bitcoin arguments are crude but correct. For example, that gold is actually a commodity (gold is irreplaceable) while cryptocurrency is more like "WoW gold"—we can make as much as we want with computers, because it isn't real. That argument is 100% true.
When he speaks of divisibility I just scratched my head. I wouldn't be surprised if he retracts that position upon closer reflection. As you say, he's a brilliant guy, and if you show him an error in his thinking he will not stick his head in the sand.

The dark net is booming, my friend. As long as crime exists there will be a need for cryptocurrencies.

That's a bad assumption. The 7 transaction per second figure has been completely debunked, and revised down to 2.7 by other analysts. But actual tests have revealed that 2.7 is a 'theoretical maximum' and in practice 2/second is very close to the tipping point.

No it's not ... it's an indication that the previously cited "7 tx/second" and "2.7 tx/second" are total nonsense.  It can't even keep up with 2 transactions per second.
It also is an indication that the very slow linear growth of bitcoin transactions could so easily be faked. Just because there are 100,000 transfers, how many real, legitimate, purchases take place that might have otherwise been done with a credit card?  (E.g., not gambling transfers or drugs-by-mail.) My guess is the number is in the dozens, if even that. 
And finally it's an indication that if I wanted to, for a few thousand bucks I could take the entire Bitcoin network offline for most of a day.  Not exactly "anti-fragile" is it now?

No, not at all, I'm just weary of repeating myself.
First, yes, I agree Bitcoin is "pseudonymous" — which by my definition is the antonym of anonymous, just like pseudoscience is the antonym of science.


That's actually a deep issue which I can't summarily dismiss and don't want to get into right now. I'm not going to say you are wrong, but please note that gold has at least *some* utility beyond being a universally respected currency. Bitcoin, however, is absolutely worthless beyond its function as a currency.
Third, the old "21 million limit" schtick.  Yeah, yeah.  We've heard since day one.  Bitcoin is limited to 21 million.  So what?   DashCoin is limited to 6 million. StabilityShares is limited to 10 million.  Does that make them better cryptocurrency than bitcoin?
All of these limits could be changed as easily as changing the block size (which is to say, not very easily, but within the realm of possibility.)  
Compare that to gold.  If we decided we didn't have enough gold, could we just hack a line of computer code and suddenly be drowning in the stuff? (Perhaps you'll tell me now, that's one of gold's shortcomings.)

I don't know anything about OKCoin but I know all about futures. Of course futures converge on a price; their value is dependent on the price of an underlying asset at a future time. The value in the future is not known.  
If somehow the hand of God wrote on the wall that the price would be exactly such-and-such on the settlement date, I assure you the futures would instantly snap to the correct price and not budge.
@_date: 2015-06-08 00:08:56
You are so right.  I notice how when I speak to bitcoin enthusiasts they invariably quote the now utterly debunked statistic of "7 transactions per second."  If the figure was revised from 7 to 17, you know they would be using the new figure.  But it was revised from 7 to 2.7, so they ignore it.  Not dispute it, just play dumb.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:52:08
Oh wow, I didn't know it was so robust. That's awesome! 
With a capacity of thousands of transactions per second, and only about 1 transaction actually occurring, it seems to me that there's no need to worry about scalability for a long, long time.
So why all the hand-wringing about increasing the block size? 
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:45:50
It constitutes a demand problem because the money people are willing to pay for those 3,600 bitcoins keeps going down and down. This is basic economics, do I need to draw you a picture?

Well if LN is at least *defined* then it's got something going for it. 
Side chains are the simple observation that you could stuff the blockchain with links to alternate crypto universes that have their own little blockchains (or even centralized servers, whatever you like). It's not a stupid idea, it's not a breakthrough, it's just sort of a way to help the entire Bitcoin sales-pitch — as if to say, "Scalability isn't a problem. We can link to some other network which actually is scalable."
At first blush the Lightning Network seems to be exactly the same sales pitch.

Here you are whining for Dunkin Donuts to accept bitcoin, but you know what? If they did, you'd be the last person on earth to actually spend bitcoin at Dunkin Donuts.
I heard the owner of one web company who removed their Bitcoin support from his site, and said he received over 30 angry emails for the decision.  Funny thing is, he didn't receive nearly 30 sales!  
So stop with the ruse.  You want to see the price of bitcoin go to the moon so you'll be rich.  It ain't working. I'm not buying your bitcoin.  Not for $230, not for $130, not for $30.

What an utterly preposterous link.
Gold is literally the textbook example of "fungibility."  The fact that some gold is minted at 999 and others at only 22 karats does't make any difference in the world.  One Krugerrand contains one ounce of gold (along with copper for durability) and therefore is worth exactly the same as the next one ounce coin.  
Bitcoin is *arguably* fungible, but I've seen discussed on r/bitcoin many times the quandary over whether or not there should be a boycott on coins known to be stolen from infamous hacks, etc. Most of the community comes down on the side of "yes, we should accept all coins, it's important for fungibility."  But with gold there is no debate--it's intrinsically fungible.  The mere fact that they have a decision to make with Bitcoin proves that it's not 100% fungible.
Then the article makes the absurd claim that bitcoin is "Bitcoin is accepted in thousands, if not millions, of locations already."
BITCOIN ACCEPTED IN MILLIONS OF LOCATIONS!
You don't think that's hyperbole?  Never in my life have I ever been in a situation where I saw that bitcoin was accepted, and on the rare occasions people in this subreddit post about it, it usually ends up being that the system is so riddled with problems that it doesn't even work.  But no, I read on bitcoinmagazine.com that bitcoin is "accepted in millions of places."

If somebody put all of their money in NFLX options and now is living on the street, I don't feel particularly sorry for them.  Likewise, if you're living on the street due to Bitcoin mania, you've found your home.

I'm not claiming to be able to time the markets, but that doesn't mean I can't take a gamble.  All investment is about the purchase and sale of risk.  Let me walk you through my logic of why selling now to buy back later is a very reasonable idea:
Suppose for simplicity that bitcoin is now at $300. (I know it's not, this is just to make the math easy). Also to keep the math easy let's say I own 100 coins. Furthermore I believe (read: "have a hunch") that it will reach $150 before it reaches $600. 
Now let's say that I decide to sell all my coins, and then commit myself to buy at either $150 or $600, whichever comes first.  That's my strategy.  In the long run, I'll hold coin, but in the short term I'll be divested.  Two things can happen:
**Scenario A:**  I sell my 100 coins for $30,000.  I wait until it reaches $150.  I buy back 200 coins.  At that point I've doubled my bitcoin holdings, and I own $30,000 of them.
**Scenario B:**  I sell my 100 coins for $30,000.  I wait until it reaches $600.  I buy back 50 coins.  At that point I've halved my bitcoin holdings, and I own $30,000 of them.
Now you may say, "Hey, you don't have a crystal ball, you don't know which of those scenarios will really play out."  Right you are.  But here's the clincher: I don't even have to be right more than 50% of the time.  
Even if these two scenarios are *equally* likely, then it makes mathematical sense to sell now and wait.  My EV for expected number of bitcoins in the future is 0.5 * 50 + 0.5 * 200 = 125.  That's 25 more bitcoins than I own today.
Even if I am wrong a little *more* than 50% of the time, it *still* make sense to do it.
And the icing on the cake is it's even better than that, because while my money is tied up in bitcoin it accrues no interest.  When my money is in dollars I can grow it as time goes by, as I wait for Btc price to reach one of my targets. The longer it takes to reach a target price, the better for me.
The only flaw in my logic that I can see is the assertion that those two scenarios are nowhere close to equally likely, that scenario B is far and away the most probable.  I'm not a believer. And as you said yourself, "it's impossible to time the markets."

By that logic, a $20 bill would be even *less* divisible. You can't cut a $20 bill in half to get $10.  You can only divide it by exchanging it for smaller denomination currencies.
The only time I've ever heard the subject of divisibility come up in an discussion about currency economics is discussing some of the failures of primitive currencies, such as sea shells, pearls, or precious gems.  Rubies and pearls etc. are entirely indivisible and therefore not ideal for monetary purposes, even in some far off Pacific island.  
I don't really see why it should be included in a chart about modern currencies which are all quite easily divisible.

Now wait a minute — I didn't say anything about making money. 
According to my strategy I would wait and then buy back when a target price is reached.  In this scenario, I start with $30,000 and I end up with $30,000 worth of Btc, no matter what happens.  My raw number of bitcoins can change, but not my net worth.  So the only profit I make in the process is the return on my USD while I wait for the target price.
The real money to be made (or lost) comes *after* the strategy is executed.  If it goes up to $600, I'll be hoping that it goes up even higher.  If it goes down to $150, I'll be hoping that it rebounds.

According to your first link, the banking system uses 2340 million GJ compared to bitcoin's 3.3 million. So the banking system is about 700 times more expensive. (I don't trust these figures whatsoever, but whatever.) So according to the article, the banking system is *thousands* of times more efficient than bitcoin, when you consider how much more they process.  The top comment on the thread points that out.
I skimmed the other two articles and they seem to be repeats of the first, more or less. It claims the banking system uses 1.8 trillion/annum to operate, compared to bitcoin's paltry 800 million.  Again, I have serious doubts about these figures, as it's not easy to measure that. But even if we take the figures at face value, compare the tasks they have to perform. Also consider that the banking system can handle more than 2 transactions per second.

The best analogy I have encountered is with the currency on the island of Yap.  The island of Yap is in the Caroline Islands of the western Pacific, and they use an odd kind of money which are gigantic stone disks.  Some weigh 50 pounds, but larger ones weigh tons.  
Because the largest disks are very difficult to move, the way that a large transaction works is like this:  the person giving the money makes a public announcement and the community recognizes the change in ownership.  The disk itself is not actually rolled from one home to another, it stays where it is.  It's only the collective memory of the community that dictates who owns what.
In one case, a disk was on a boat and fell to the ocean bed. The community all agreed that even though it was on the ocean floor, it was still owned by the person who owned it, and that person would be free to spend it like any other disk.
You see what's going on?  The money itself becomes secondary, the only important thing is the collective memory of the participants as to who owns what.
Bitcoin works on a similar principle.

With blockchain spammers it could double overnight. Over at we were doing the math one day to figure out how much it would cost to cripple the entire Bitcoin network. The answer was surprisingly cheap, but lucky for Bitcoin nobody really gives a fuck to do that. If COIN ever starts trading I fully anticipate hackers taking up short positions then flooding the blockchain with trash. We'll see where the price stands when confirmations take longer than a day, eh?
In short I'm agreeing with you. Bitcoin is actually quite vulnerable and this band-aid would be a moderate defense against the simpleminded flooding attack.

Not exactly. From the point of view of the consumer in my satire, it would be frictionless. You leave a box out, a Learjet scoops it up, and it ends up at the destination all for free.
The metaphor should be obvious (boxes = blocks, Lear Jet pilots = miners, shares of LJE = bitcoins, etc.).  The point is that if this was a real company, its sustainability would be ludicrous. We have jets consuming thousands of dollars of fuel to make a 'free' delivery -- but's that OK, as long as they get 25 shares of LJE that they can turn into money to pay for the jet fuel. 
Of course, that's the metaphor for a one dollar bitcoin transaction costing 400 quadrillion hashes to secure (i.e., much more than $1 of electricity) -- but's that OK, as long as they get 25 bitcoins that they can turn into money to pay for the electricity. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:27:58
Oh, it's a form of security; to clarify, I said it's not *cryptographically secure.* 
It relies on human behavior to achieve its goals. Obviously, all the miners could team up today and pull off a 51% attack (it would be a 100% attack in that case.) The arguments why that won't/can't happen have nothing to do with mathematics, they are simply theories on group psychology. And maybe they are right, but I will trust the math behind elliptic curves far more strongly that I will trust somebody's theory of the behavior of mobs.
We've probably already reached the point where the miners who turned off their gear due to price collapse could turn the juice back on to perform the 51% attack. We just trust that they won't, because reasons. That's not cryptographic security, that's optimism. Even if it's justified optimism, it's not what a computer scientist would regard as "secure."

That's a good point, I honestly didn't consider that.  
I don't think it changes the final estimate very much, though. Many Coinbase users have external wallets: they use Coinbase as means to get bitcoin, then transfer money from there to one wallet to the next.
I admit, in retrospect, the 250K estimate is rather fishy, but there can't possibly be more than 500,000 bitcoin users in the world, even if you stretch the definition of "user" as somebody who bought some as an investment and now sits on it.  If you define a "user" as somebody who regularly pays for goods and services with bitcoin the number has to be well under 100K.

Now there's somebody who *doesn't get it.* 
Bitcoin is completely insufficient if you want to make a mass payment.  There are over 20 million owners of Apple stock, do you suppose Apple could pay its dividends by "pushing a button" and flashing Bitcoin transactions to 20 million people?  How long would the blockchain be stuffed with such transactions if we tried to push 20 million of them through it? About 3 or 4 months?
Whatever Bitcoin is useful for, it's not useful in the scenario of one entity sending payments to millions of receivers.  And it never really will be; its scalability problems positively prevent it.

That 7-ish figure was re-examined and regarded as overoptimistic and the new literature claims 2.7, although it practice we've seen that anytime it gets near 2 it starts to slow down for everybody considerably, so whether it could operate cleanly at 2.7 or if that's a theoretical maximum is anybody's guess.

All serious answers:
The 250,000 figure was published in an article I read recently. I'm not trying to dodge sourcing this; I will find said article and get back to you on that.
About "dust or nothing" — my memory tells me that the article said that most wallets have dust, but I might be mistaken.  Again, I'll return with an update.
Why to people without bitcoins subscribe?  Well, I'm here.  It's very easy to find bitcoin interesting—one way or another—without actually having invested in bitcoin or use it on a daily basis. Another thing you have to take into account is that some people have a dozen reddit accounts and if they are into bitcoin they probably have all of them subscribed.
EDIT: The article was [Bitcoin's Overblown Wall Street Debut]( and it reads "Coinometrics, again, reports that the actual number of wallets holding more than one bitcoin is around 250,000, which translates to less than 250,000 people."  Ah, so it's not "non dust" whatsoever, it's setting the threshold at 1 BTC.  Still, I would argue that only a small percentage of genuine bitcoin users/proponents have less than 1 BTC, and there are far more wallets than users, so the point still stands.
@_date: 2015-05-12 05:47:47
The last paragraph is meaningless, I suspect you refer to a different one. But what are you referring to, the increase of the block size?
Even in a best case scenario it will be an incremental advantage: instead of being able to handle 3 transactions per second, it might go up to 30. It will never reach figures like the 47,000 that Visa can process. It will never be able to send funds to millions of people.
Maybe some cryptocurrency one day will, but bitcoin will never be that cryptocurrency. The problem is in the proof-of-work method. With so much energy spent on confirming each transaction, the network is by design very inefficient. 
Some people suggest "off chain transactions" to solve the issue. That would work. But "off chain" is like saying "without bitcoin", so it's hardly a suggestion to improve bitcoin. It's just saying that some other method must be created to replace it where it fails.

I could try to look it up, but you know how hard it is to dig stuff up from bygone days on reddit. FWIW, it wasn't very serious math, more like back-of-napkin calculations. The premise was that somebody makes a couple hundred thousand transactions per day, for random (and possibly large) amounts, in order to stress it beyond the 2-3 tx/s limit.
@_date: 2015-05-11 14:45:23
Those were off-the-cuff calculations but it's really quite simple.  Bitcoin can do (optimistically) 2.7 transactions per second, some say 2, some say more, but let's call it 2.7. There are 86,400 seconds in a day so that makes 233,280 transactions daily.  However, it's already doing 100K daily, so that's about 130,000 extra transactions that it has room to support.
So how long does it take the Bitcoin network to process 20 million transactions?  20M / 130K = 153.8 days, or 5 months.
So my math was a bit off.  Not 3-4 months, rather 5-6 months. Hey, I was in the neighborhood.
TL;DR = Bitcoin is not capable of performing mass payments.

Not at all, I'm a libertarian and place more credence in the school of Austrian Economics than Keynesian economics. The notion that a government can produce a fancy sheet of paper to instantly create value is absurd, and eventually it will catch up to them, as it has with every fiat currency in the history of man.
I really *wish* that Bitcoin was a feasible alternative to the current monetary situation. When I first learned about it I was excited that might be the case, and predicted that governments might outlaw it out of fear for their delicate house-of-cards. 
But now that I know more about Bitcoin, I conclude that can't ever happen. Maybe some cryptocurrency can one day, but Bitcoin isn't that currency.

I should do that, but it's a complex topic and to do it right would be a lot of work. I actually have more than one quibble with it, one technological and the other just a question of economic sustainability. 
I know it's not what you're asking for, but I did write a [bitcoin satire]( at r/buttcoin which pretty well expresses why I think it's not economically sustainable and mocks the gross inefficiency of the technology.
You are right, though, I could do better. Thanks for the encouraging words. And I will have an open mind. If I ever get sensible answers to my questions, it would actually change my opinions.

Three words:  PROOF OF WORK
It's a horrible stupid concept, it's not cryptographically secure, it's a waste of resources, and it's never once been applied to any useful project. (Save Bitcoin, presuming you regard that as useful.)
Any system that relies on PoW is both inefficient and insecure, and one day that will catch up to Bitcoin. In fact, we're already witnessing that as miners shut down under the burden of lower prices. 
Beyond that technical reason, there is an economic reason for the price collapse: it's a speculative bubble, and bubbles always burst, and if you think this one has burst already you ain't seen nothin' yet.

Technically it's a "Miranda *warning*" and not "Miranda rights" and it applies the second you talk to a cop, arrest or not.
There was a video going around the other day where a cop asks some fellow if he's been smoking marijuana, and he says "No." Then the cop says "When was the last time you smoked?" and he says "About an hour ago." BOOM, under arrest, he just confessed to DUI. And everything he said before the arrest can be used as evidence.
The Miranda warning exists so that the person who is now in hot water doesn't make matters even worse for themselves due to a misunderstanding of their rights.

Somewhere less than "all of us" and more than half. 
What would be refreshing is if somebody came along and said something like this: "I've learned about bitcoin, I am so excited, I am dedicating the next two years to work on Bitcoin technology. But incidentally, I don't own any btc outside of a small wallet I use for testing purposes; I don't think it's a wise investment at these prices."
I've never read a post like that once here. Not even once. The loud and deafening chorus is "bitcoin is the future and we're all going to be rich." That's why when the price jumps a tiny bit the whole subreddit explodes in flames.
Get back to your work now.

I'm in the same boat. I thought that one of the greatest features of bitcoin was the anonymity. I thought that's why they called it "digital gold." Turns out that's a half truth at best, and for practical purposes it wouldn't be a stretch to call bitcoin the "least anonymous money ever created." It's as if every $20 bill had a history of every owner of it, going all the way back to the mint.

No, not the *other* miners silly, the ones who turned off their rigs. 
Suppose some super server-farm is pumping out the bitcoins when the price is over $300 but is forced to go offline when it price falls below that point. And it does, along with similarly large mining operations. 
Now suppose the price flounders below $300 for a long, long, time.  These ex-miners are all sitting on costly equipment which is depreciating. They hope that the price goes back above $300, but until it does, there's no profit in them mining. So just suppose, that one day they figure out that they have way more hashing power than all the online miners put together. That's when they could suddenly go back online and perform the 51% attack.
Again, my point here is not whether or not this scenario is likely, or whether people would have sufficient motivation to behave that way. I honestly don't know. My point is that there is nothing "cryptographically secure" about the socioeconomic scenario which is proof-of-work bitcoin mining.

Not to be contradictory, but time isn't really an issue, just volume and degree of price movement.  If it lingered under 266 for a few months and only broke 260 on a few occasions, the support would still be considered to hold.  But if it broke 260 for just an *hour* on enormous volume, then we can say the support has broken.

That sounds about right, just from the seat of my pants. The logic is that back when bitcoin was $10-$15 the Silk Road was flourishing. People were really using bitcoin and that's what the market settled on as a reasonable price.  
These days there is still illicit activity taking place and also legitimate economic activity on top of it.  So now I doubt a $10 price would sustain the activity that's going on.  So $30 sounds about right.
One tiny wrinkle though:  short sellers like to kick something when it's down.  So if btc really did drop to $30 a bear rally could send it lower than the rational price, but that would only be temporary.

It would make crimes like drug purchasing trivially easy to prosecute. Imagine if you were a drug addict, and your dealer got busted. Now they know that *you* paid him money at odd hours of the morning in small increments for years.
Ironic idea for a science fiction novel:  In the world of the future, all commerce is done through a bitcoin, which is now accepted and endorsed by the US Federal Reserve.

Basic technical analysis:  "old resistance = new support."
More basic technical analysis:  when you break a support, expect the price to keep falling.
One possible interpretation of the data is that since the $266 support failed, it's headed to $30.  But not so quick:  just because it happens to trade at $265 for a day doesn't mean the support failed.  Technical analysis is not an exact science, the support is just a general range from $260-$270, it has to pierce that barrier significantly and with volume.

The people here with lots of bitcoins are not "rich off of bitcoin." The people who are rich off of bitcoin are the ones who cashed out during the crisis in 2014.
The market cap that went from 10 billion to 4 billion, where do you think that 6 billion went? Into a black hole? That's 6 billion dollars worth of bag-holder money that got extracted from the system. (And I define a "bag holder" as anybody who's paid a cumulative average price more than the current price of btc).

Gold is backed by the work it takes to produce it. You have to mine a ton of ore from a mine, process it, and after all that you're left with one ounce of gold. That's what's called intrinsic value. Put another way, gold doesn't need to be backed by anything, because gold is valuable in itself.
A US dollar bill is also "backed" by something in a loose sense the term: the sweat of the American worker. Ayn Rand put it more bluntly, "Paper [money] is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at the heads of those expected to produce it."
The key distinction is one of past and future: the gold represents work that has already been accomplished, the paper is a promise to do work at some future time.
Bitcoin will never fit into the first category. (I know, "work" has been done to create the bitcoin, but unlike gold the bitcoin itself has no actual use outside of currency.) Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. So if it is to continue to have value, it must find its place in the second category, which makes it more like a fiat currency than gold.

It took bitcoin four years to go from a market cap of basically nothing to a market cap of $1B. If you go back to those days r/bitcoin was celebrating like there was no tomorrow.
Now twice that amount is wiped out in a few days. Four years of growth, wiped away in 24 hours. Then the same amount of growth wiped away in the next 24 hours.  It's not going out on a limb to think that tomorrow another billion will flee the market.

Whenever I see things like this, I think that it just is a testament to the general economic/financial ignorance of bitcoin enthusiasts. There is a very old and well studied branch of finance that has to do exactly with this sort of thing: the futures exchange. Betting on the price of some commodity on some specific date in the future, or if it reaches one price before another, etc. 
It's all been very well studied and volumes have been written on the topic, but these people see one of these "bets" and roll up their sleeves and do arithmetic to solve the problem, as if they are the first people to ever have thought of it.

Oh, absolutely. I thought that was understood in what I was saying. The fact that gold is useful is a given. (Does anybody seriously question that?) 
But that fact alone doesn't give it value.  Air is much more useful to us than gold, but air is not what an economist calls "valuable".  The fact that it takes a lot of work to produce an ounce of gold, combined with the fact that it's useful, that's what gives it value.

Not the military so much as our internal police structure. Countries like Brazil which have virtually no military presence still have enormous economies. 
The fact that if you don't pay taxes, whether in Brazil or America, you'll be escorted to prison at the point of a gun. That creates an environment where the currency is universally recognized as valuable, because it keeps the parasitic state off your back.

I'll let you on a secret:  shorts take their profits off the table *all* the time. They have to, they are obligated.  People who shorted at $1000+ prices and still are holding their positions are stupid.  The way to make real money is to short at $1000, cover at $900.  Then short at $900, cover at $800, etc. etc.  Always selling, always buying, all the way down.
When you look at the big picture the shorts aren't really hurting the price, because on the whole, they are buying as much as they are selling.
So don't blame low prices on short sellers. They are the symptom, not the disease.

Well, there are several arguments, and the satire piece really only focused on the non-technical elements. But if you want to delve into this deeper, first:


That's easy to do. Visa, Western Union, MasterCard, all the big banks, these are publicly traded companies. We can scrutinize their reported overhead down to the last penny. 
Meanwhile in Bitcoin land, we don't have such documents.  But we know it takes 300-400 quadrillion hashes for one transaction. Really? That's like using a Learjet to send a postcard.  


Show me your figuring.  
What's the latest reward/transaction figure? About $5-6? It's been as high as $90 during the big bubble. While that's most likely a higher figure than the actual cost of processing a transaction, it's got to be in the ballpark. 


To the end consumer, that I can't deny. It definitely is cheap to send bitcoin, from me to you. Maybe $5 worth of coal will have to burned to make it happen, but we don't pay for that coal, so who cares, right?


Frankly I'm too lazy as well, but like I said, it's public information and the bottom line is that they process a *huge* number of transactions compared to the huge expenses the burden. And in the end, they are more cost effective than Bitcoin. However, they pass the expense onto the consumer.
I am of the opinion that this attempt to allow the consumer to avoid the cost through some system of subsidies is not sustainable, just as my fictitious Learjet Express is not sustainable. Time will prove one of us right.

Well I don't claim to have a crystal ball. Some things I am sure of, other things are totally guesswork.  Could the price go to $1000? I doubt it but I'm not going to say it's impossible.  It's happened before!
Could bitcoin be used as a large-scale currency good for more than just a few weird gambling sites and underground drug markets?  That's where our opinions truly differ.  I can see that it is entirely unsuitable for actual large-scale commerce.  Even the drug markets will be forced to abandon it, if the drug markets become more popular.  
From a technical perspective it's a piece of crap.  It does't scale, will never scale, it is not sustainable in the long term, and it does not offer the security that it pretends to offer. I could get into a lot more detail, but that's my general thesis in a nutshell. 
I am *hoping* that the crypto markets will eventually come to grips with this reality without me going broke trying to profit from it. The old saying about markets remaining irrational is true, which is why we short sellers grab our profits while they are on the table and don't try to take up long-term positions.

From there it might bounce, who knows.  Eventually of course it will be worth nothing but the way to profit isn't to just short-and-wait, it's to grab profits all the way down.

The one I've used is called MultiCharts but I know there are 100 others. It's not really a recommendation, just the one I know.
When you try to find that patterns are useless you'll surprise yourself by running into the illusion that patterns are useful.  For example, you make a statement like "if a stock is down 3 days in a row, it will probably go down on the 4th day."  You do a deep test across thousands of stocks and you find that the statement is true 70% of the time.
Now did you really find the key to instant fortune?  Not so much.  If you engage in the strategy of short selling stocks that have been down for three consecutive days you'll be "right" 70% of the time but that other 30% of the time will wipe out all of your profits.  The technical bounce comes very sharply and it's a horrible time to be short.  
In summary, it takes a lot of research to prove that a trading premise is either right *or* wrong.  It's never clearcut.

Some people might think, "Ah! This is the brilliance of Bitcoin! It uses old ideas that have been never used!"
Well, not to say good ideas are occasionally discarded, but ideas are discarded for a reason. There are reasons why we never used Proof-of-Work as a way to combat spam. There are reasons why computer protocols don't work on voting mechanisms.  
And so, if you tell me that computer scientists find Bitcoin laughable, I am not surprised in the least.

There are lots of financial technical analysis programs which try to match a price pattern against some other pattern in a similar stock or industry. I don't think you can get rich that way but it's not a horrible idea. If you have other reasons to buy or short a stock, finding lots of examples where a nearly identical setup worked in your direction is a good confidence boost that you're making the right move.

Agreed, but that's a necessary consequence of the right to a jury trial.

Thanks for taking a crack at estimating what I assumed couldn't be known. However to point out obvious criticisms:  the 500,000 figure is mostly speculation (it could be much less, but also much more). Next, I wouldn't assume that nearly every active Bitcoin user has a Bitcoin wallet. But 1 in 5200 doesn't sound crazy, just a little optimistic.
A more precise estimate could be made by tallying the number of downloads that the most popular wallet apps have received, and divide 2.6 billion by that number.

He said *marginal utility* which is a basic economic term not synonymous with "usefulness."  For example, I'm selling apples for a dollar. If you're hungry you'd like one and buy one.  Then maybe you're still hungry and you buy another.  Now you're not so much hungry, and getting sick of apples, and the third one doesn't seem like such a great deal.  After a certain number of them, you are so sick of my apples you wouldn't accept one if it was free.
Now how does this relate to bitcoin?  Well, people have had only a few reasons to buy bitcoin.  The main one is a speculative investment: the belief that buying bitcoins is a kind of "savings" that one day will make them rich.  People who believed that have already invested.  There aren't newcomers rushing in to buy their first bitcoin at $220, there are only bagholders praying for the price to go up.  Suppose you go to one of those bagholders and offer to sell them some more bitcoin?  You'll find it's a hard sale.  It's like selling an apple to the guy who just ate 10 of them (and the last one had a worm in it).

Because back when Bitcoin and the Silk Road were inseparable, the price was stable at $5-$10.  That means that if you take out all of the venture capitalists and get-rich-quickers and Winklevoss brothers etc., you're left with a core price of $5-$10. 
Now if Microsoft or some corporation was doing a million dollars worth of bitcoin business daily, you could honestly make the argument "the market is growing."  But it really isn't. It all comes back to drugs and illegal pornography.

This is because the blockchain is bloated, slow, unpredictable, and not even cryptographically secure. Satoshi might have had some good ideas, but the first implementation is getting long in the tooth and near the end of its life cycle. 
The new applications of blockchain style ledgers will have to be greatly improved over the Bitcoin model, if they are to exist at all.

Well, here's the situation. The financial markets are coming unglued. The price of gold and silver are up sharply.
Bitcoin however completely ignores the financial markets. There is no correlation between bitcoin and the price of gold, the price of oil, the S&amp;P 500, it's just in its own little la-la land.  If the Dow Jones crashed to 5000, I don't think it would move the price of bitcoin one penny.

No, absolutely not, it de-emphasizes it as a currency and presents it simply as a get-rich-quick scheme (or at best, an "investment") which is to say, ultimately it's a Ponzi. You buy now hoping it will be worth more later, not because it has any intrinsic value.
If however you actually use the stuff, i.e. conduct commerce (illicit or otherwise), then you are supporting it.

Here is my critical complaint with the article, for it promotes a misunderstanding of the technology that bitcoin enthusiasts are also blind to:


Bitcoin transfers are absurdly expensive when you take into account all costs. They only seem cheap the end user because of a system of subsidies.
It's often said that Bitcoin is an idea that appeals to libertarians.  Well, I'm a libertarian, and the word "subsidy" makes my skin crawl.There's no such thing as a free lunch.  If somebody has to pay good money to get a payment from Alice to Bob, that money will have to accounted for.  Right now it's accounted for by inflating the entire money supply and giving the newly born coins to the miners. That system is not sustainable.

I think it's clear from Satoshi's writings that he intended the price to increase rapidly so that the infrastructure could be created. It's unclear if he understood the implications of what he was suggesting.
Anyhow, the motives of Satoshi himself are rather beside the point. The question is, do we really have a sustainable system here, that can keep chugging along based on its own merits? ...

"once block subsidies disappear"
That's a bit disingenuous, there is no magic day when the subsidies vanish. It asymptotically approaches zero. *Long* before the hypothetical 2140 date the subsidies will be negligible. 
The bottom line is, the Bitcoin network is very expensive (relative to what little it is accomplishing at the moment). If the endgame plan really would work, with the competing transaction fees that people predict will replace the subsidies, then there's no reason to not switch to that model ASAP.  And if, on the other hand, the endgame plan really is unsustainable, then there's no reason to continue trying to prop-up a faulty idea.

The only reason why OP wrote WTF is because he or she didn't understand how the American patent system works. 
You too clearly are confused. Just because they patent a "tip jar" doesn't mean no  other company cannot make their own tip jar. The patents all include something very specific, usually many things, which, if duplicated, would indicate clear intent of wrongdoing.
For example, Coca Cola owns multiple patents on pop-top cans. That doesn't mean that Pepsi can't use cans, they just can't directly copied the precise design, down to the very bevels.

You understand my claim very well. I'm a little uncomfortable using the term "subsidies" here, for that usually entails taxation by a governmental authority, but for lack of a better term that's what I call it.




Yes again, except it won't take nearly 100 years.  The asymptotic descent to zero will make mining unprofitable long before the hypothetical 2140 date is reached.

Don't take this as a contradiction, but I don't understand the distinction you are making between "process transactions" and "maintain integrity of the ledger."
In my mind I can't help to fall back on a database as a metaphor. Imagine somebody saying "The main function of MySQL is not to insert and delete records from the database.  It's to maintain the integrity of the database."
Those two things go hand in hand. It goes without saying that if you delete a record, you don't want to see it reappear, and when you insert a record, you want to end up with that record (and never two copies, and never zero.)  The integrity and the insert/delete process are inseparable.

The scenario of low-fees for the users of BitCoin is not sustainable. It costs enormous amounts of computing power to send $1 from Alice to Bob. The only reason why neither Alice nor Bob have to burden that cost is due to the block-reward subsidy.
Sooner or later the block reward subsidy won't be enough to reward the miners (we're already seeing that happen) in which case relatively enormous fees will necessarily start to appear, perhaps on the order of $5-$10 per transfer. People will use BitCoin like Western Union: it's OK (but not great) if you want to send $500, but for a $20 purchase it's untenable.
Of course you can always say "this is solved by off-blockchain transactions", which is another way of saying "this is solved by not using BitCoin."
On the darknet markets, perhaps a $5-$10 surcharge wouldn't be that bad.

I can't speak for others, but I'll tell you why I personally hate it. 
I would love nothing more than to see a decentralized internet currency that is fast, efficient, cheap, secure, and private. However, bitcoin has failed us on every one of those promises.
*FAST?* — It's fast only when compared to traditional banking systems, and even then it's a laggard. A credit card transfer can go through in a few seconds, while a bitcoin transfer can take an hour or more.
*EFFICIENT?* — 300 quadrillion hashes to send one payment. Absurdly inefficient.
*CHEAP?* — It might seem cheap as an end user, since those 300 quadrillion hashes are performed by a group subsidized by the block rewards. But in fact it's very expensive to secure the blockchain, and one day the end user will feel that pinch.
*SECURE?* — To the average man on the street, bitcoin is exactly as secure as his home PC is. Not at all.
*PRIVATE?* — It's the antithesis of privacy. Having every transacted ever conducted, recorded for all history, should be a libertarian's worst nightmare.
My heart is really with you guys. I too would love to see a cryptocurrency which is everything you say bitcoin is. Unfortunately, that's not bitcoin.

Bitcoin itself will *never* scale.  
What is possible, I admit, is that it interfaces with a system which actually is scalable.  That's akin to a man saying "My horse can go 150 miles per hour!  I just have to get off my horse, and hop into my Maserati."

@_date: 2015-03-24 18:25:09
Completely irrelevant. Proof of work is a relative concept: how many hashes are required to secure the blockchain is a function of how powerful modern computers are.  
For example, if tomorrow Intel launches a quantum computing chip that was a million times more powerful than current mining technology, the situation would not change one bit. It would not make mining cheaper, in fact it would make it more expensive, as current miners would have to upgrade their hardware to be able to keep up.
There's no end to a proof of work system, it just grows and grows until the subsidies run out.

From a marketing point of view it doesn't make sense to confuse potential customers/donators by adding an option that muddies the waters.
Suppose somebody had their credit card in hand and was ready to donate, but then saw some "bit-whatever" logo as an option. They might take the time out to investigate what that is. Then they might get distracted and watch cat videos and never get around to donating.
The bottom line is, your proposal might make bitcoin donations triple, but make regular donations decrease 1%. If that happens, they are a big net loser.

Exactly right. According to my math, anybody with about $10,000/day to spend on hurting bitcoin could basically clog the network by spamming the blockchain. (If the 20Mb block size ever is implemented, that price will go up, but it will still be affordable.)

Concerned that people would figure out that the ~~ponzi~~ investment scheme has an expiration date, he invented "transaction costs" as a plausible explanation for how the system could sustain itself when the ~~ponzi-payouts~~ block-rewards vanish.
Nobody really believes that the system will one day sustain itself on transaction costs, but it lets the proponents have a talking point on the very rare occasions when they find themselves talking to somebody intelligent.

16 billion was invested into Lycos, and as you know they fizzled out and gave way to better search engines, and then years later the company bought up by some Korean outfit for under $100M.  That's 1/160th of the former market cap.  Today the company is surely worth far less.

You talk as if the system is ready, right now, to handle Visa-like transaction loads of 150M per day.
Where do you get that figure of "100 million or more"? We currently have a system that does 100K per day and buckles at the knees when that it pushed toward 200K. It just takes a little bit of excitement in the market to make confirmation times take over 1 hour. How do you anticipate that the system will be able to handle 1000 times more transactions in the future? Is the "bigger block size" the answer to all scalability concerns?

One of the huge myths about Bitcoin is that it reduces money transfer costs.
Reality:  300-400 million billion hashes per second, to secure about 1 transaction per second.  That means that for every transaction you make, computers have to perform 300 million billion hashes.  (I prefer to say "million billion" instead of "quadrillion" because it's easier for some people to get their head around it.)
It costs a lot of money to perform 300 quadrillion hashes. The raw electricity alone is several dollars, but you have to also take into account rapidly depreciating hardware and human labor costs.
So when you send $1 to some bitcoin dice site, remember that it cost the network several times more than $1 to make that transaction possible.
Frictionless money transfer? I think not.
@_date: 2015-03-28 19:37:55

I'm just half-joking, nobody knows what price it will trade at, but I personally believe in technical analysis. And one of the fundament principles is that old points of support, when breached, become new points of resistance.  So it's not that it *can't* go through $300, just that it will be really, really hard.  So many shares changed hands at that price (and lower ones) that it becomes extremely tempting to jump out of the game when it hits that level. 
So from a day-trader's perspective, if it reaches $297-$299, then smart trade is to immediately sell short.  The short seller must be prepared to lose money if it pops to say $305-$310; he's not going to go broke if some irrational rally pushes it to $1000 again.  However, if it starts to drop, he'll hold on until anywhere from $188 to $280 depending on his risk tolerance.  This way, he is guaranteed to make much more money when he's right than he loses when he's wrong.
None of this means it can't break $300, just expect strong resistance around that price.  However, note that there's certainly no guarantee that it will ever trade that high again.

Without getting into much detail, let me link to a humorous piece I wrote on the topic in which I made a comparison between bitcoin and a fictional company that's absurdly unsustainable, by using shares of its own stock to subsidize its operations.

Maybe you should keep your ideas to yourself, as they clearly aren't well thought out. Assuming your client in Egypt has no idea what a bitcoin is, which is 99.9% likely, then your solution would be a much bigger problem than just using PayPal.
In the unlikely case that they own bitcoin and actually want to pay with bitcoin, then your solution might be feasible. But that's not the case, is it now?
It's fine to dream of how wonderful the world will be when everybody gets on board, but for today you have to cope with the reality that the people you do business with are not interested in this payment method, and for good reason.

Nothing goes sideways forever. Bitcoin will either hit $300, or $200, or both.
I don't know if it's going up or not either, and I am not saying that it's going down. I'm just saying that it's *likely* to go down. I say this because history is on my side. Had I said that at least once a month for the past year (and I have) I was correct 12 times out of 12. That's not dumb luck, that's simply what day traders refer to when they say "the trend is your friend."
And what is bitcoin's trend? That would be *down.*
Even though it is currently higher than the midpoint of $250, the likelihood of it hitting $200 is greater than the likelihood of it hitting $300.

You actually raise some good points there. (And yes, I know that coal is something like $50 a ton, so I confess, referring to "a pound of coal" is way for me to overstate the horror of the situation.)
I have no idea what the coal-to-hash ratio is, I was just speaking off the cuff there.  I just knew it had to be pounds and not tons. I sincerely thank you for doing the legwork. (And of course, not all electricity comes from coal, I picked that just because most electricity comes from coal, plus it's more quantifiable than, say, nuclear energy.)

Oh is that your quote on the sidebar? Good for you. Really.
Anyhow, I don't deny that Bitcoin is a "wealth storage system" (albeit not a very good one, lately) — but when you say "not merely a cheaper payment system" I question if you understand my point at all. There's nothing "cheap" about bitcoin: the transfers are incredibly expensive, computationally enormous, and as such take a relatively long time to settle. So it's expensive in terms of time, computation, electricity—any measurement you'd like to use, it's expensive.
The fact that the end user is shielded from the cost of that computation of 300 quadrillion hashes is entirely due to the block reward subsidy. That is not a "feature." It makes it seem as if the end user is getting something for nothing, but it should be obvious that is entirely unsustainable.

Your argument presumes that bitcoin is superior to other forms of currency in every respect. It's not. 
Its pseudoanonymous (read: not anonymous) nature makes it usable in illicit transactions, and that's where it will be popular in the foreseeable future.

Regarding bitcoin? When it gets above $300 on firm volume.  But the smart shorts covered back at $200 and are waiting for the next failed $300 rally. In other words, right *now* is the perfect time to short it. If it breaks $300 on good volume then I'll exit the trade and minimize losses. Anybody who enters a trade with absolute certainty is an idiot; the important thing is that you stand to gain more than you stand to lose.

That's odd, because the more I learned about bitcoin the more I became convinced that it's unsustainable.
300 quadrillion hash computations just to send $1 from point A to point B. Enough computing power to burn *pounds* of coal sucked up every second. All made possible by the Ponzi-like structure of the block rewards.
Proof of Work is an interesting concept but doesn't have many practical applications. Bitcoin is proof of that.

Bitcoin isn't the only price chart that I analyze, and I don't need to go do more research to convince myself that markets follow trends.

Prices do not move randomly. I'll be the first to say that they are impossible to predict with any great accuracy, but they are *not* random.

Well, yes, but those two things weren't unrelated. When money becomes scarce nobody wants to spend it and then its velocity decreases even more.

I'm just curious. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:23:43
The bottom line is, bitcoin is anything but frictionless.  It could in principle "work" but it will too expensive.  The fees of a bitcoin transfer will make Western Union's $25 surcharges look downright attractive.
Basic economics:  if you have to burn a pound of coal to send a transfer, then ultimately the cost to the consumer of such transfers will exceed that of a pound of coal.  The only reason the consumer apparently can send money for free today is because that coal is being subsidized by miners dumping their coins on the market.  But the party is coming to a close, my friend.

When Warren Buffet makes an investment, information is only revealed after the fact, if even then. Not many people know he bought some 10 million ounces of silver in the 90s. He didn't show up on talk shows to explain why silver was underpriced.  He kept it to himself and made a killing. The price of silver was going to go up whatever he did.
However if you invest in a ponzi scheme, it's a different story. In that case it's best to shout it from the highest rooftop, before you invest, while you invest, and after you invest. If you don't get other people to follow your footsteps, you're toast.

I do agree that fiat money is also a Ponzi scheme. The most successful one in history. We auction off treasury bonds to make the money to pay off the interest on the ones that are maturing. Bernie Madoff credited the Treasury Department as his inspiration, and I don't believe he was just joking.
Like many people into bitcoin, it's clear that you blur the line between Bitcoin as a method of transmitting money, and bitcoin as a replacement for fiat currency. As a replacement for fiat currency, I think your heart is in the right place. Bitcoin is as good as anything. I too love how it's beyond government control (other than outright banning it) and how the supply is finite. That's exactly why people have used gold as a currency for thousands of years. 
Unfortunately, as a method of transmitting money, Bitcoin is utterly unsustainable. That will be its downfall, although I don't think it will survive long enough to actually reach the point where it collapses. Rats will flee the sinking ship.

No, you can exactly say it's fake volume.  When penny stock pumpers "paint the tape" they buy it back and forth from one another (even *with* fees!) in order to give the impression that there's a lot of volume even though it might just be one person. That's fake volume. It's designed to lure people in by thinking "wow, the interest is increasing."
So if the conclusions you are drawing from your chart are "the interest in increasing" then you have to temper that with the fact that some unknown quantity of volume is in fact fake.

Thanks. I've heard rebuttals to this position, and not to try to construct straw men, but the most common points I hear are these:
1. The aforementioned $1 which takes 300 quadrillion hashes to send could just as easily be $100 or $10,000 or a million dollars. The cost doesn't change whatsoever.  Therefore the cost per unit-of-value can be very small even if the cost per transaction seems rather high.
2. As the system scales upward (e.g. by increasing the block limit) the efficiency as measure on a "hash per transaction" basis will plummet.
Those are two solid arguments. They still raise questions, but I won't say that they are wrong. They are good starting points for a debate. However I've also run into some fallacious rebuttals, primarily this one:
1. The miners operate for their own selfish purposes, and they will keep mining as sure as the sun comes up, so it doesn't matter one bit to the end user at all what their expenses may be.

No, I don't think it will stay "that way" forever, after $100 it will hit $50, after $50 it will hit $25, and so forth and so on.
The dark net markets *might* save it from reaching zero. I don't know how big those markets are (does anybody?) but it might cause the price to become stable in the sub-$20 area. Or perhaps something like DarkCoin will end up being preferred over bitcoin for that purpose in which case the target price for BTC becomes zero.
@_date: 2015-03-07 07:34:12

Technical analysis (which is far more than "drawing lines on a price chart") absolutely works and has been proven to do so.  And in 2014 it indicated that the bitcoin price was going to continue to collapse, and it did.

He makes a lot of good points in the video (some of them very prescient, like the prediction that *"gox"* would become a verb!) but I found that statement facile.
People short (which is to say, borrow) instruments all the time, and theoretically any investment can "go to infinity", or at least go high enough to wipe out the investor. I have a short position in an energy company right now, but my broker lets me do it because I have cash on the sidelines to cover any reasonable rise in price. And should their be an unreasonable rise in price, he has the authority to buy my shares back at market the second things get even close to risky.
Anyhow I'm glad you liked the video enough to make it to the end.

At the time of the video, Karpeles was actually nowhere to be found, so that was perfectly topical. The price of bitcoin was close to $1000 so the discussions of miners shutting down was a prediction, not a retrospect.

OK, we've come full circle and you've proved my point. You knew Netscape was buggy at best, but its competition sucked even worse, and it was really useful, so you used it anyhow. 
Obviously you didn't say "Well this might be really refined in 10 years, I'll forget it about it check back in 2005."  Maybe our moms said that, but we didn't. We used it, because whether or not we like to complain about it, it was very useful.
And that's where the metaphor with Bitcoin breaks down. People today are not saying "Bitcoin sucks, but I have to use it, because it's so incredibly useful."  They have another obvious option: just don't use Bitcoin.

1% of what? Redditors? World of Warcraft players? Don't tell me 1% of people in general ... Bitcoin has always been a tiny tiny niche mostly used by drug addicts.

Should have sold the whole 1.2k buddy but good that you had the brains enough to sell any. Most people didn't and now are crapping their panties.

OMG what amateurs! Mt Gox, Btc-e, Bitcoin24, they are all amateurs!
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:06:22
Just wait 6 months and they'll be 50 cents to a buck each and then you can buy a handful of them to play around with. They'll probably go down more but if all you want to do is play around on girlsgonebitcoin then don't sweat it.

Like every other form of paper fiat currency ever made these are destined to be worthless. One day people will realize that those notes are not IOUs for anything, they are literally not worth the paper they are printed on.
Bitcoin too suffers from the problem that it has no intrinsic value whatsoever. If Bitcoins could be tied to precious metals or crude oil, they might take over the world one day. As it is, just a silly string of bits that only a fool would covet.
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:06:21
Don't worry--bitcoin won't be a get rich quick scheme ever again. The price will just drop and drop until you can pick up blocks of 1000 Btc for a few bucks and miners will quit because it isn't worth the bother.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:16:17
Oh yes there's a chance for a 100x appreciation. The same is true with wheat, comic books, and my dog's boogers! You can make that argument about positively anything in this world.

More like, wait a week and see if they are spending your money in the Bahamas!

No, but smarter than you that's for sure!
@_date: 2013-08-24 07:27:31
That's supposed to be worth something? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:36:59
What the OP doesn't mention is that the next leg of the chart plummets faster and worse than the first leg down. He's basically illustrated a "bull trap".
If you want to make lots of money here's what you do: buy now, wait a week for sentiment to flip, then sell at a profit.
Let me repeat that last part since some of you didn't pay attention the first time around: *then you sell at a profit.* Don't forget that part--the whole thing fails if you forget to do that step.
OK kiddies go have fun now! Much money to be made in this bubble still!
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:03:52


And by "analysis" you mean, "something I pulled out of my anus"

The only thing I can't figure out is why you didn't want yourself to know that it would then go crashing down to $15!

Don't get too caught up in the emotions of it all.  Good luck!

I love how all you bit coiners pretend to be pro-cryptocurrency, but in reality you aren't.  
If somebody presented something that offered better security, transaction verification in milliseconds, better privacy, you would shit all over it.  Why?  Because your money is tied up in bitcoin.  No other reason at all.
I'm not saying Litecoin is superior, I'm just saying that if it *was* superior, it wouldn't attract any attention from the bitcoin community.
And guess what, fools:  there is an unlimited supply of crypto currency.  It's no better than fiat in that respect.  We've got bitcoin, litecoin, peer coin, namecoin, novacoin, primecoin, feathercoin, yourmomcoin, younameitcoin … the world will one day be awash in meaningless cryptocurrencies.
So mortgage your house and get a piece of the action now!  What could possibly go wrong???
@_date: 2013-09-14 09:41:45
LOL ... The best way to convert cash into bitcoin is to use an illegal website and hook up with sketchy criminals around the world, and mail then wads of cash hidden in packages.
Let me guess, the best way to convert it back is also on the Silk Road?
@_date: 2013-09-06 23:26:37
Bitcoins forever! Just like Zip Drives!
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:46:39
Then they'll buy into bubble-mania and quit their job and go running off into the sunset singing "I'm a bitcoin billionaire!  Weeee!  Look at me give away money!  I'm looney!"
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:49:57
*had* being the operative word there lol. 1 billion dollars goes *poof* in an instant. Next other billion vanishes. Soon you'll realize your so called market cap never existed in the first place.
@_date: 2013-08-04 18:57:03
Well the party is over bitcoiners ... might as well sell your buttcoins now while you can get good money for them, you can always buy them back later if you still insist on playing your little games with pay money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:46:35
Lucky for them!

Cryptocurrency 2013 = Internet 1994.
Bitcoin 2013 = Trumpet Winsock 1994.
EDIT:  For those too dense to understand, what I'm saying is that Bitcoin is a great technological idea that will be *replaced* by even better ones.  Your bitcoins one day will be worthless just like Trumpet Winsock is worthless today.  But the idea behind it, it's golden.  This specific implementation?  Don't get married to it.

Tee hee

Bitcoin: so sketchy that even porn sites stay away.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:33:09
It's not a crash yet! No volume for it to be a crash. Fools are still bullish, they need to get caught in a bull trap buying in at the new "low price." The big pain is still to come when the real [despair]( kicks in.
@_date: 2013-10-12 00:11:55
Haha that's about ALL you can buy for bitcoins, LOL.
@_date: 2013-08-24 07:38:12
This is just the beginning... It's not going to stop at Gox. Soon transfers from Btc to $$$ will be very difficult if not impossible.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:00:08
Does it bother you that a big bunch of techno kiddies gained and lost millions overnight and somehow want to blame you for their ignorance?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:42:50
$2.50 as in two dollars and fifty cents of US currency?  That's real money.  I don't see why a bitcoin should be worth that much.  *You* are the one who is exaggerating:  exaggerating the value of bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:51:05
Lol look at all the butthurt bitcoiners downvote me! Waaaaaaah I want my million dollars back waaaaah!
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:35:16
Then I'd say go look at the chart now and eat shit, dork.

Let's see what other great predictions this economic genius has provided us with:
"Here's Why A Crash Is Coming In Two Days-To-Two Weeks" May 18 2010


(The S&amp;P was about 1000 when he wrote that, it went straight to 1400 without taking a break that year, and now of course it's almost at 1800.)
LOL what a piece of work.  If he says to buy bitcoin, you probably want to short it.
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:20:01
Oh boo hoo hoo for you why don't you sue them on the grounds that you're really, really butthurt? I hear that butthurt settlements can be very large, might make up for some of your losses.
@_date: 2013-08-04 19:07:05
Only a complete retard would own these anyhow. These coins look like they were made for Dave and Buster's ... only a total idiot would think they have any value other than play money.
How stupid do they think bitcoin enthusiasts are? Wait.... Don't answer that.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:42:27
It's risk free because they convert it into *real* money the second you pay. Get it? Bitcoin is not real money; merchants don't want to hold it one second longer than they need to. But if it can be used as a go-between and allow some dude in India to buy something, they love it.
@_date: 2013-08-08 05:29:38
LOL, yeah right. You run a business with bitcoin?  And you *don't* accept credit cards. LOL, I'm suuuuuure. x
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:50:10
Bitcoin is buggier than a beehive!  
People who sink their wealth into bitcoins make the crazy old codgers who bury gold in the backyards look quite intelligent by comparison.

This sub is so butthurt I bet somebody could make a fortune selling Preparation-H via bitcoin.

My prediction:
The NSA will steal bitcoins from bitcoin owners using one of their back door tricks one day. Not just a few bitcoins but they will go nuts attacking every bitcoin user they can simultaneously.
It will be played up in news as Bitcoin is totally vulnerable and not secure at all" and then the market will crash.
