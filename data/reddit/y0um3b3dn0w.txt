CLA 45 AMG**. Not even in the same class as C63 AMG

In my case, I thought I was being super smart by setting a custom fee without confirming it twice. Ended up setting my fee to one sat per KB. Good luck EVER getting that confirmed haha

Except this ain't no C63...

What does the number of unconfirmed transactions mean? This number just keeps on rising and rising. Isn't that very bad?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:16:46
This. I had $200 worth of BTC sent to an address where I accidentally set the price at 7 Sat. Still unconfirmed after almost 3 weeks.

Try the method I posted in OP. It might get confirmed once you resend with higher fees.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:53:21
Since the transaction is unconfirmed, can you try this method to resend the same amount of coins but with a higher fee?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:08:17
That's what I was told also, however, my transaction never did get rejected.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:51
I did 7sat. Its been 3 weeks. I have lost all hope. But if I do get it back, at least it would have increased in value!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:30:59
Yup not even worth it. If your willing to wait 24 + hours, the lowest  you can get it down is like $5 - $6

If you have no idea, you should really, REALLY take all the time you need to educate yourself. Try making very small transactions, less than .03BTC. And make sure you are using a secure connection, especially not that you let the whole world know you own 25 BTC...

Lol this doesn't have no V8...
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:26:49
Congrats, you just made the list.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:52:02
Lol, that websites states "transaction fee is too low"


@_date: 2017-11-19 23:09:11
Thanks, Is there a way to estimate fees / how long transaction should take? For example If i had chose 10 satoshi per Kilobyte my fees would have been 1920 instead of 192 correct? How long would my wait time had been then? Thanks again.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:42:19
Thanks for your advice and reassurance! Ill be sure to verify my backup before doing this.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:40:09
BTC.com has an option for "accelerate transaction" which comes out to about $26. Way more than what the normal fee would have been, I assume. Also I have read that some of these "accelerate transaction" features are a scam.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:53:47
Sounds like it. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:43:22
Thanks for the feedback! With the increase in value, I would actually prefer if it didn't go through now and return to my wallet haha.
