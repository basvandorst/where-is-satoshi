I think if he uses his own reserves that would make bitcoinica a bucketshop

if you go to a branch and deposit cash it only takes a few hours

It's ok for banks to issue currency, it's not ok for banks to control the issuance of currency ie use govt to enforce a monopoly of a single banks (The Fed) currency.

the exact performance of the proposed asic doesn't really matter seeing as any type of purpose built asic is going to extinct gpu's almost instantly and eventually fpga's.

you posting while stoned ?

that's fast if you're using a 5770, slow for anything else.

don't know anything about macs sorry, but when you do get it installed download the blockchain from here -  . Letting the client do it takes a very long time.

well they've been around for 5 months, and business is booming for them so I'd feel comfortable leaving cash with them.  I doubt that high cash interest will be high for very long though.

not a destructive monopoly because if they tried to squeeze users there's plenty of other exchanges that offer just as good a service that people could run to (which i have).

would the standard client want a fee for that transaction?

uh the freezing of accounts is mostly to do with complying with financial regulations (mtgox make their bread from people trading, freezing accounts benefits them in zero ways besides making the regulators feel authoritative). You're basically blaming libertarians for the consequences of retarded regulations?

I think that's from more people using online wallet's, leaving their btc's on exchanges etc.

sounds like you're running stock clocks on those cards, they're capable of 200mhsh/second+ each.  You'll want to underclock your memory as low as it can go(mem speed has no bearing on mining performance) to save power and lower temps and maybe overclock your core.

i'd mine &gt;50% of the blocks and just keep the coins, no changes here.

yeah it's the wild west out there, how is that different from any other emerging technology/market?  This is how we sort the wheat from the chaff.  What would you suggest, a bunch of individuals you find agreeable overseeing everything?

Of course they're stupid enough.
