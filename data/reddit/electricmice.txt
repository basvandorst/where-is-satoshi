no you're not a dick. you're just dumb. you're not benefitting from it whatsoever and you will never benefit from it. that's why insider trading was outlawed to begin with. you're like the dumbass middle classer who votes republican because you think they're gonna lower your taxes when in reality, it only affects people making over 200k a year.

but isn't his whole demeanor very fishy though? why was he so secretive at first? then now he does shit like call it bitcom? there's no way this man could be that dumb unless he's doing it on purpose. even his engineer brother admits he is highly intelligent. look, even the fucking cops knew about bitcoin. how can this man who has such high technical skills not know about it until his son told him about it? it would make a lot of sense if he realizes that there's no way he can hide away from the media other than to fake it like it's not him. honestly, to me the only hole in this story is the fact the used his real name. if it wasn't for that, i would really believe this guy was really nakamoto. all i can say now this guy is extremely suspicious. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:19:00
why did he run away when asked about bitcoin? if he had nothing to do with it then he would've been dumbfounded when the reporter accused him of it. it would not emotionally shake him at all because he doesn't know shit about it like he admits in the AP interview. yet, he ran away, hid away fro a few days then comes back acting like a fool calling it bitcom. what if he used his real name when he started the project because it was just a small side project he did and posted it to forums. andresen said himself that when he spoke to the cia, that's when nakamoto disappeared. 
now we see this real life dorian nakamoto and he's paranoid as shit and used to work in classified stuff too. it would be extremely interesting to see some expert analyze dorian's written work with satoshi's. that's probably the only way to prove that they are the same person. it would be too much of a coincidence if they both have the same grammatical quirks. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:06:59
this is starting to sound like a movie but it'll star a white guy as satoshi. or maybe satoshi could be japanese since he's old. it would star a young white guy who'll end up hooking up with his japanese daughter.

every time i see news about people accepting bitcoin or bitcoin price going up it pisses me off but i keep reminding myself that i know nothing about bitcoin and it would be almost a complete gamble.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:16:07
so a guy can't fake mispronunciation? he can't lie? amazing how that works.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:05:21
for some reason, i don't think he would come out even to save his own kids.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:04:46
even his photo is stolen from photobucket. it's so weird though that he would use his real name when he went through great lengths to stay anonymous. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:44:56
im talking about his dad. a lot of non engineers think engineers know everything or that they're all alike. only about 10% of engineers are good design engineers. then, his dad would have to be an engineer in an electronics related field to know about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:27:08
how does one sign a message?
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:30:53
but the reporter didn't lie. dorian corroborated the "misunderstood" statement. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:11:45
i too can not believe that he was referring to some project. mainly because the reporter approached him asking about bitcoin. why did he run away from it at first? didn't he just have a ton of time now to think up a good lie? he asks for a free lunch and calls it bitcom? come on. you think a guy who was smart enough to work on top secret shit has so little self respect that he needs a free lunch?
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:21:17
is the vast majority of humanity paranoid and secretive?
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:58:02
yes, and his mannerism was very convincing in the interview too, specifically when he said "she wrote all that" and exhales. so it's very difficult to know if he's lying. although, i would say that as a man of average intelligence, even i could've done what he did in that interview. i've done it 3 times already in court for 1 auto accident appeal and 2 tickets. 
in the interview, he pronounce words like "nuthin" and "workin." i've never heard any immigrant pronounce it like that but i've heard a lot of american born speakers say use that. i mean, the guy has been living in the US for 50 years. how can his english be bad. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:15:39
did you see the interview? dorian barely has an accent at all and he speaks in an american vernacular. his english is a second language excuse doesn't even make sense. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:08:35
what kind of engineer is he though? is he a programmer? some engineers don't know dick about engineering to begin with. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:34:38
the damn video is only like 1 minute long and it features dorian speaking with a very slight accent and using american vernacular. the man has no problems with english.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:29:55
you're crazy if you think a secretive person like satoshi gives a shit about some guy being hounded by reporters. it's not like dorian is receiving death threats. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:32:28
uh, more than likely, if he had no idea what bitcoin was, it would not disturb him emotionally and he would not run away.
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:27:10
lol. wow one random ass redditor got proven wrong! we won guys we won!11!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:59:24
if the real nakamoto sends a message denying it now, it would look very suspicious. it would almost prove that we have the right person because it bugged him enough for him to send a message saying it wasn't him.
edit: after i wrote this i realized that he really did post as satoshi saying he's not dorian. the plot fuckin thickens.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:02:08
really his explanation about his statement meaning he was not involved in engineering anymore doesn't even fucking make sense. who says that about engineering? if he did say that then it means he used to be in top secret shit and is extremely paranoid about something. even then, the reporter specifically let him know that it was about bitcoins, why would he think it was about his classified work before?
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:03:51
holy shit this reporter is an asshole. he went to everyone in this guy's life to invade his privacy and even his wife revealed that he had prostate cancer? wtf is that? however, i'm glad i read all that stuff because it just made this guy appear even more legendary. he's not a myth now, he's real and he's legend. if it weren't due to his weird personality, he could've founded his own billion dollar company or rose very high in a company.
on another note, i'm oddly related to this guy. my college professor used to work for hughes aircrafts and i used to make cables for L3 communications. lol. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:40:11
yea because they didn't have the coins for real. they were losing so much due to being hacked but they kept it afloat with a ponzi scheme. apparently the story was, they were losing millions slowly over the years or months yet they didn't do shit about it. then when news broke that there was a bug in their system that allowed fake transactions, everybody tried to withdraw at the same time. that's why they won't let them. it's like a bank run. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:25:21


this is exactly why it's so suspicious. why was it that satoshi did not come out after so many have asked about him for years and now this random dorian guy gets accused of it, satoshi returns to say he's not dorian? why would he give a shit about one guy? it's not like anyone is threatening to kill dorian. the fact that satoshi was bothered enough about it goes to show that there is indeed a good chance he is dorian.

everyone who is not an idiot knows a bubble when they see it. it all comes down to greed though. all these speculators are riding a train to hell. the thing that no one knows is where it will stop. so they're trying to extract as much money out of it with as much risk that they can tolerate and get off before it blows. then there are the normal people who also knows it's a bubble but they're so greedy they stay in. the only difference is the speculators can tolerate that risk and loss, the normal people can't. a hedgefund can lose millions and even go out of business but the people working for it already made millions from it. it doesn't really hurt them.

it's funny how the list has to be named influential men. if it was influential people, there would be like 3 women it and it would be called sexist. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:39:06
everyone who is not a retard know it's a bubble. as with all bubbles, all the speculators are riding a train to hell but nobody knows when it'll blow. they're just trying to catch as much as they can. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 20:07:04
as a matter of fact, they understand it very well. they know bitcoin is the ultimate threat to their business model. their business is reliant on the fact that it's very difficult to do currency transactions online and internationally. bitcoin solves that problem for a very small transaction fee.
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:51:31
hell would freeze over before ebay accepts bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 20:08:41
why wouldn't people just bypass paypal's bitcoin and go straight to bitcoin themselves? 
@_date: 2013-04-04 07:23:52
i think people are gonna start dumping bitcoins so fucking fast now. as the value rises hackers are going after it. these bitcoin websites don't have the security infrastructure like banks do. if i owned a shit ton of coins i wouldn't feel safe with these sites. soon we'll see more and more sites hacked.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:34:06


UGH give me a fucking break dude. at worst you're a guy who doesn't know shit and at best you're a shill. good lord i hope people here aren't that stupid.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:58:26
looks like the ddos proved to everyone that bitcoin is not a trustworthy currency after all.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:44:10
that makes no sense though. he could just buy it himself it that was the case. the reason businesses even accept bitcoins is because they sell it right away to get dollars back. nobody speculates slowly by using customer's money. bitcoin could crash tomorrow. 
now, about the 20%. if financial services weren't taking it from him and now he discounts 20% for customers, wouldn't he be operating at a lost?
@_date: 2013-07-27 20:05:45
how could they profit from bitcoin when the transaction fee is so low? right now they're making a lot from it. they also have no control over bitcoins because they can't hold it hostage like currency. bitcoin is the ultimate threat to paypal. anyone who trades money for something that they don't need to return will never need paypal.
