We're really going to have to start using Satoshis for measuring value because it still sounds so weird to buy a car for less than a bitcoin. Just imagine when BTC finally hits $1m and we'll be buying buildings for a single coin!

Hey, thanks a lot for putting this up man. I've been dragging my feet on switching my Ledger Nano S from legacy to Segwit and finally got around to it after seeing your posts multiple times. Was more worried about accidentally losing my coins than the transactions fees, but figured I should do my part in making the switch for the good of the community.

Hey man, there's really no need for that kind of negativity. There's an adoption curve and we're all on it. I'm sure most of this forum, you and I included, weren't here since the beginning. Folks will pick it up in time and we should be doing our best to make it easy and desirable for them. We will all benefit.

Ohhh right! Okay, thanks. I remember learning about this. I actually thought about the LIBOR scandal when I read about the daily settlement rate. It appears to me that any agreements like these tend to start with good intentions, but become corrupted over time since the bank's priorities are aligned.

Sorry, but I don't know. Would you be able to explain please?

Dude I wonder if this is actually true and trading volume goes up every 15th and 30th. Anyone willing to run the numbers?
