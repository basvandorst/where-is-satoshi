I think it's rather rude that you're taking something I came up with and trying to make money off it without even asking permission.
@_date: 2016-06-12 03:14:35
Thank you. :)

I made this for fun, but would anyone want high quality vinyl stickers if I get a batch of them produced? 
I will look into shirts, but would want to do them justice with high quality screenprinting...

Sounds cool. That's crazy that Amazon takes that much, but it's pretty much what I'd expect. Cheers!

Here you go:
If you do make money feel free to tip me. ;)

Ah, bummer.

Thank you. I think probably the best thing would be for me to just put up the high resolution assets under a Creative Commons license. Then people can do whatever they want and it'll be more clear what is acceptable. I'll do that shortly...

I decided to just make the high resolution freely available under a CC license, so do whatever you'd like... 
Tips welcome. :)

I can do it since I made it and have the source file, I just need to know the level of demand. I'd rather do stickers because shirts are a lot trickier to produce...

I mean producing actual screenprinted shirts of high quality. Print on demand services aren't going to create a quality shirt unfortunately...

This *might* be a bug...
@_date: 2016-06-12 00:44:01
Glad you like it! I will look into that! :)

Can we *please* rename Bitcoin to Dollarydoos?
