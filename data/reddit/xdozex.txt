Really all charitable events that happen should happen in Bitcoin. That would certainly help shake the bad stigma crypto currently has from the damage that was done by the Silk Road and other Dark Net Markets!

John is an asshole.

I'm using GDAX right now. No issues at all.

Curious to hear how you're handling the tax implications. I want to accept BTC/ETH as payment options, but I'm worried that each payment received is a taxable event, and then the conversion from crypto back into fiat would create another taxable event. Has your accountant provided any advice to avoid this?

So the real question is how good of an ROI on these, considering the cost of the annual subscription?

Nothing about this is common sense. I think its safe to assume that through the 'comedy of events' OP accidentally provided an old wallet address that's no longer available and the company sent the BTC to the address that OP provided. How is the company on the hook for the payment owed if the company sent the payment to the address OP provided? 
If I owe you money, and you tell me to mail a money order to your address, and then give me the wrong address, it's not on me to pay you again, and then chase up the new occupants to recover the money. That makes no sense at all. 
Feel really bad for OP but this doesn't sound like good advice.

Why exactly? Not trolling, genuinely curious about Hawaii and why a truck is a requirement..

Yeah, I was more just curious if the fees you can receive would come close to covering the subscription.

They really need to fix their padding and line spacing. That site is really hard to read.
