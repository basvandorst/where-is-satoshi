Fun story: one of the rich white girls from my high school became one of his groupies for awhile. I don’t know if she still is but she’s in some of his Instagram videos lmao.

But did you take him up on his offer tho? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I lost 200 out of a 570 asset back when BTC was at 6900... Ended up selling all of it and taking a break. If I had just stayed I would be at double that amount. Lesson learned, hodl!

I don't want any half-human, half-gazorpian mistakes.

Lord knows we need the work outs with the heart ache the corrections give us lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:23:49
Typically you want at least three months income in savings just in case something happens. As bitcoin is not a stable asset and can drop quite quickly, only invest what you are willing to loose. And last but not least, HODL.

Would any of these be better then holding my coins in an exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:12:20
Well gdax holds onto the fiat in between bank transfers so I guess a bank transfer isn't necessary, or if your apprehensive about a correction maybe put it in an altcoin? Tryna brainstorm here(; 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:14:43
At this point I might need to default onto that lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:00:16
I’m pretty sure that gdax only limits transfers to and from bank accounts and does not limit trading? Correct me if I’m wrong
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:20:02
That makes a lot of sense, thanks.

Did a report on this in high school like 4 years ago when it was $100-200.... Really freaking wish I had bought some then.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:15:42
Yeah probably will now, Blockfolio is nice but sometimes it doesn’t refresh.

Well if we want to get technical, the force of gravity dissipates the farther away you get. Given by F = G * (m1*m2)/r^2. Thus the farther up we go the less pull we have towards the earth... Also theres escape velocity to consider as well... What does this mean? Bitcoin hits 15K by the end of the year(; To the moon!

At that point might as well just use the card otherwise and just transfer straight from my account lol. Good idea though
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:57:59
Why not use GDAX? It's pretty much Coinbase, actually it is Coinbase, just with a more advanced interface and lower fees
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:59:36
This my sir is exactly what I wanted. Thanks

Sorry what’s a MLM site?
Edit: Saw in another post it was Multi Level Marketing.

It’s not because he dropped down his shoulder?
