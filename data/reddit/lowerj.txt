Use Authy. You can back up your 2fa tokens.

Tether failing will not tank the market. Where’d you hear that at?
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:40:13
Good job! You have the correct answer. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:39:02
You can use the app Authy to back up 2fa codes.

I have been noticing a lot more posts like this lately.  They frustrate me too.  Your comment illustrates my frustration spot on. Surprised more off these posts just don't have a bcash donation address.

Not money, but representation of resource.  Decentralized Coin Economy rewards redundant, cryptographically secure, open source, P2P systems.  Bitcoin is a resource management tool.  With it we will be able to construct the foundation of a new, fully tokenized, fully inclusive, digital economy.  One that will not need large centralized server mainframes \(for datacenters\), or old fashioned steel and concrete vaults \(for money/valuable storage\), or centralized infrastructure of any kind.  Our livelihoods will not be tied to capital and debt but to the day to day workings of society \- we will all be more connected.

Got downvoted to piss on this one, but who cares. So many people defending this dudes "tweet storm" not even reading it.  Just because satoshilite RT it.

Wow. It is my right to call this above post STUPID, nonsensical, rambling, devoid of real content, and overall boring.
@_date: 2018-10-24 22:10:28
I downvoted op post. Lol can no one think for themselves anymore?  Reddit has very little merit for the "mainstream adoption of bitcoin" you guys are fooling urselves.

Lightening compromises security to increase speed. Faster does not mean better.

You are so spot on. I share the same opinion. I think people want to be bitcoin “investors/traders/millionaires” so bad they forget what crypto currency is meant to do. How is a decentralized open source digital system anything like any company regulated by the SEC as an ETF???

Gotta end with “this is not financial advice DYOR”

Let's go back to the bcash drama. tether drama is boring.

Kudos to the product launch. But I see lightening as a patch/hack on top of bitcoin.  Why create this beautiful blockchain architecture to have this clunky gateway node tech hack on top?? Seems like a bandaid or a bunch of coders just doing something because they can. I just don’t see how this makes bitcoin better in anyway.

Trading bots may be a lot more complicated than you are aware off. They do not simply place ASKs on the order book, they also stack BIDs, arbitrage across coins and exchanges and use many different advanced trading techniques only profitable when done by computer.  Bots will not “stall” the trading system out but add liquidity and create a more responsive market.

Encrypt your backups with a strong password. Sync your codes between two devices then turn off multi-device on your mobile device.  Use a PIN to lock your Authy mobile app, a feature not available with google Authenticator.

FIAT is the real bitcoin!!!

I will test it when I get home.  Bookmarked for later. Very interesting project!
