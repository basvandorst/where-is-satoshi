I think it's the threat against ECC pub/private key cryptography (via Shor's algorithm) that might allow the missing coins to be recovered, not the (lesser) threat against SHA256.

I guess I'd prefer that actions metaphorically related to an "actual wallet" be eliminated, not emulated.  Seems like a step backwards from modernity.

Apology accepted.
Until LN arrives, and I get to use it in real world scenarios, I'm trying to keep an open mind.  My biggest concern is that if it doesn't arrive "soon", it may lose its window of opportunity.  The window of opportunity issue has been a big impediment to acceptance of superior technologies over my lifetime, so time will tell.

Stop right there.  Can you first acknowledge that your post title *completely* mischaracterizes what is happening?  It's flat out wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:12:41
Well that's ironclad then.
EDIT: To elaborate, if *I* were trying to "hide" spam transactions, I would do it in a way that didn't leave obvious visual patterns.  Like spreading them out over time, randomly.  An obvious visual pattern might indicate some other automated behavior that isn't subterfuge.

Well, if I end up needing lots of channels, each w/ 0.05 or more bitcoin, that kind of stinks (imo).  If I *don't* end up needing lots of channels, perhaps because of hubs, then that may also not be great, depending on the nature and cost of the hubs; I'll wait and see.  Granted, it can't be worse than trusting your bitcoin to exchanges...


Thanks for that bit of toxic assumption.   Happy holidays to you too.

I honestly can't tell if your statement is defending or criticizing LN.  "Works like a checking account with a bank", doesn't exactly seem like a leap forward to me.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:30:42
Those things were already the *Bitcoin* leap forward.  The LN leap forward needs to be "also convenient, fast, dirt cheap, and foolproof", which hopefully it'll turn out to be.  But the bank analogies (imo) don't do it any favors.

You "open" channels by pre-funding them (afaik); that kinda stinks.

It's a Christmas miracle!  Jesus rose from the dead in just 72 hours, and Bitcoin will also!

Interestingly, Rowan Atkinson's other most famous character also ranted about how Charlie Chaplin was the world least funny person.

Definitely!  A lot of people think the first series isn't so good, so maybe start on Blackadder II.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:46:07
Blackadder ("Blackadder Goes Forth", in the episode titled "Major Star").

How exactly does Segwit improve "efficiency"?
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:35:53
Segwit transactions are *not* smaller in bytes.  An old style transaction and a Segwit transaction of similar type store nearly identical numbers of bytes.

When he said "the bitcoin SW", that means "software" not "segwit".  I don't see him mention segwit anywhere.
