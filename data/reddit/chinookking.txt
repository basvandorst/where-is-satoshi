will it be sold as a coin?
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:29:10
what does that mean in English?  Couldn't I just hold BTC and BCC and see which blockchain ultimately wins?
My opinion BTW is to leave BTC alone.  It's slow?  Who cares?  Will always have major value as 'first mover' or digital gold.
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:20:33
That was ETC mantra.. how did that work out?
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:20:25
explain please, what is UASF?
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:25:46
This is bad timing guys.  Why fight this out during a ATH Bull run?  Stupid.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:36:54
its ironic because i want to find a way to sell 'unspeakable coin' to get more BTC with the money from sale!
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:50:49
Kinda sucks Trezor cannot get people their BCC to sell.  A lot of people bought Trezors simply for this purpose.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:56:33
so if I would of had my BTC in Bittrex  I would have been credited equal amount of unspeakable coin and could have sold it for $1000 on Bittrex huh?  F.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:51:35
really?  come on man.  not funny at all.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:37:53
so will we ever be able to send unspeakable coin to exchanges due to these factors?
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:37:20

@_date: 2017-04-02 18:45:29
back above $1100. good news!
@_date: 2017-05-01 02:13:59
Bitcoin is at a new ATH!! Maybe it is a good time for another bitcoin civil war to break out...  
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:52:04
Haha God you BTC people are the best!  No wonder ETH will take you down as number 1.  
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:53:08
great question, let me know if someone has a good way
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:57:38
So if miners continue to signal 100% for Segwit, and Aug 1st comes and goes.  There will be fork at all?  So basically no need to worry at all?
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:17:35
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:43:24
that is good news.  lets get this done!
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:12:02
You BTC-ers can be real dicks.  
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:32:32
So everything is looking fine to keep coins in Coinbase because over 80% miners are signalling BIP91.  And basically Coinbase is talking about not supporting a different scenario entirely.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:37:05
'control their coins' you mean pay the fees to move em around and see it dwindle away
@_date: 2017-07-12 00:11:39
its all because of this Aug 1st BTC drama.  You people at BTC could f up a blowjob.  I can't wait for Aug 1st to get things back to normal.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:47:54
Would Exodus be a decent option?
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:57:35
yeah good luck with that!
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:03:38
Haha thanks!  I get it.  I'm lazy at times.  You need to understand that you BTC could have given all your options easier to understand names; Segwitt 2xx?  BIP 48, GFY 2D!
@_date: 2017-07-12 00:09:58
total FUD
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:42:57
what does smooth activation of SegWit mean?  No two chains?
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:59:25
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:38:11
So where do you keep your BTC?
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:30:16
So reaching that 80% is still looking very likely?  
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:10:00
Unreal.  How many more times?  Treat me the way you ought to do!
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:12:56
So what was the point of the BIP91 signalling if BTC is going to fork anyways?  WTH?
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:06:43
yeah man, blood it the streets.  after Aug 1st this thing is gonna skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:34:25
Fantastic!  Lets get this done and move on!  Get ready for $4500 if this goes smooth.
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:07:28
how exactly do you do all of that?  is it easy?
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:45:33
Markets correct.  Just relax and hold.  
@_date: 2017-07-03 21:36:56
I don't care what you guys decide.  But for the Love of God get on the same damn page.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:07:28
unreal those clowns can't get it together.  they are positioned to be a major exchange.  spend some money and fix your sh%t.  
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:15:54
i think you are wrong.  it hits 2450 and holds.
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:05:49
thanks BTC! Love you guys...
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:25:45
I'm sure a big boy will step up soon to occupy the niche.  Or coinbase will drop $25 mil or so on a HUGE upgrade, tech and new employees.
@_date: 2017-07-09 00:51:44
less talk more Trollbox
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:21:19
Anyone know the max withdrawl limits on Gemini?
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:39:27
it looks like coinbase is back up now, confirm?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:31:21
all i want is for BTC to settle the f down somewhere and MOVE SIDEWAYS.  Is that too much to ask?
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:19:41
I just want it to go sideways for like 2 weeks.  Is that too much to ask?
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:09:54
look at the 1 day and 3 day charts, price bounced perfectly off the Simple Moving Average.  Still a bull run.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:17:43
god you BTC people are so emotional.  i bet it holds 2k
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:54:00
what is a Trezor?
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:25:02
I do know a ton about crypto.  I was just hoping for a non asshole response of 'its looking like BTC won't split into two chains'.  Mainly so others could click my 'English Please!' link and get an immediate answer.  GL to you!
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:55:31
F%$k that.  F there BS regulations.  They are trying to turn US citizens into sheep.  Get off your fn phone and look up people.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:40:58
If Aug 1st goes well (explain what that would be) what happens to BTC on Aug 2nd?
