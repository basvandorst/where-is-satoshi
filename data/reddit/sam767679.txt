Great example thank you
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:41:31
Can you please explain your reasoning?
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:52:05
He is saying if 1 Bitcoin is worth $2.1 million then the total Bitcoin market cap is 1% of the total offshore tax havens assets value. So he is saying that $ 59 trillion BTC market cap is 1% of of the total offshore tax haven assets value. That does not make sense to me.

Is there anything I can do to unstuck it?

In this particular case: 1. only for receiving 2. from myself . I don't see any problem it poses. Am I missing something?

What prevents me of using the private keys? I will get a new address once I do so. Also getting coins from coinbase, kraken, and other exchanges

Umm I see, what if I sweep the paper wallet before?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:42:57
Why would I be missing on forks? And how does it destroy privacy if it's only me sending to myself from different addresses?

it's a new tech not a stock, the stock paradigms don't apply. One billionaire can make the price skyrocket in an hour if he wants.

The trustee owned 1% of the total supply of Bitcoin, wtf are you talking about? You really think that dumping 1% of the total supply of bitcoin wouldn't affect the price?

You mean the supply of USD only, not other currencies

Bitcoin has always been booms followed by busts, however impossible to predict how long the busts or the booms last. Hope you get them at the price you want though :)
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:24:15
4 million Bitcoin are lost, 8 million or more are at the hands of hodlers. That means that at the very max 29% of all Bitcoin could be for sale. So the increase/decrease in market cap will always be disproportionate.
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:45:48
Nah, 60k by end of year
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:13:06
80% of world's wealth is at the hands of 1% of world's population. So nothing different there.

They recharged me 5 purchases without any btc in exchange. Pure theft.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:30:03
Yea, if you were alone doing a transaction that's what would happen according to the headline. But you're not alone dumping. If you dump 100k now, at the same moment there will be thousands buying and selling making your dump invisible.
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:57:32
Lol truth is nobody has any clue what's going to happen short term, could well go up to 15,000 in the next 2 weeks as well

Here is the bank's punchline: "The net flow into cryptocurrencies is very much a function of coin creation which is controlled by computer algorithms and in the case of bitcoin is diminishing over time. Figure 6 shows the net amount of money invested every year since 2009. The cumulative amount has totaled around $6bn since 2009, well below the current market cap of $300bn."
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:52:58
You can always find any past article that will fit the desired narrative
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:56:45
Btc did x10 in 2017. 2017 marked the real recovery from Mt Gox crash and the back to exponential growth in my opinion. If btc is still in exponential growth, then 60-120k by eoy is more likely than not.
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:05:43
That reasoning is flawed, because 1% of world population owns 80% of the wealth. If only a few billionaires poured money into Bitcoin, the price would explode. According to a JP Morgan study, the Bitcoin market cap is 50 times higher than the USD put into Bitcoin. We could reach $ 1 million very fast.
@_date: 2018-03-26 05:32:34
Insane fees on coinsquare and very high rate
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:33:51
It is written at the end of the article: Here is the bank's punchline: "The net flow into cryptocurrencies is very much a function of coin creation which is controlled by computer algorithms and in the case of bitcoin is diminishing over time. Figure 6 shows the net amount of money invested every year since 2009. The cumulative amount has totaled around $6bn since 2009, well below the current market cap of $300bn."
So basically 3 months ago they saw that the net total USD value put into bitcoin since 2009 was $6 billion, for a market cap of $300b .  50x more.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:35:56
Yea you know better right
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:06:34
Awesome thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:39:56
Amazing guy
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:37:30
No they compared to the net flow of USD into Bitcoin since 2009.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:31:41
Yes you won't see any difference because thousands, or tens of thousands, are buying and selling at the exact moment. Thus making the impact of your transaction invisible.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:30:24
Of course it won't budge, there are thousands of people buying at the exact same moment you are selling.
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:44:23
By the way this is why John McAfee may be right.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:09:03
No I called 4 times , 4 different support, and they all denied it was their fault. Plus the " joint statement " is written nowhere on visa's website, only on coinbase's

The party hasn't even begun really, it's still ultra speculative.
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:10:48
Super unsafe in IMHO, they still did not refund all the visa holders they double charged. They can freeze your account and your Bitcoin at any moment on a whim. Their customer support is garbage. Don't trust Coinbase.

as known nowhere, visa is the fastest way to get bitcoin without the risk of getting your bank wire stuck in limbo

@_date: 2018-02-10 00:11:52
Why the hate?
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:41:28
Are you sure that's the reason? Because the lost Bitcoin amount to 4 million, way more that what this implies.
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:20:41
"if 2% of this wealth gets reallocated to bitcoins, that would make for a price of $16,038.43 per BTC ". No false, because the price of BTC rises by much more than the amount of money put into it (because only a very limited amount of BTC is available for sale). Also 100,000 seems very low, given the growth rate we have seen over the past 9 years, and the network effects, I think it will be  either 1 million by 2020 or close to $0. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:39:43
I read your comment and I think I understood it. Did you read mine? I explained why you get zero slippage. A few days ago the market cap of Bitcoin increased by $17 billion in the span of 30 minutes. So it is definitely possible to manipulate that market thanks to that " multiplier " .
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:40:07
Mcafee's prediction is the one that makes the most sense in terms of math actually.

I called Visa, they said it was 100% Coinbase fault. There is no statement whatsoever on Visa's website.

I'm not complaining I'm warning everyone dumbass

No rule, they can claim that you did an illegal transaction (even if you did not). Or they can claim that your ID is fake or anything similar to what Paypal can do.

They can pretty much do whatever they want until you sue them.

I only trust him when he has skin the game actually, ie when his dick is at stake
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:36:37
You're aware the Monero founding team can do whatever it wants with their coin? Just like the real Ethereum ETC got ditched by Vitalik for ETH ? You're aware Monero is relatively easy to 51 % attack right? Just like Verge was forced to fork after a 51% attack 7 days ago. Please don't compare gold to painted steel.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:59:54
If one individual has too much influence and control in a community, then the community becomes centralized. Don't you get that? Don't you get that Bitcoin was created and Satoshi withdrew exactly to avoid that?
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:27:13
Why are you focusing on my Bitcoin holdings? How does this have anything to do with the discussion? Why does it seem unbelievable to you that someone can see something as vaporware, and not see it as a threat? Ethereum hasn't delivered anything of any use, end of story. And anything that can in theory be built on Ethereum can also be built on top of Bitcoin, with the security Bitcoin brings. Sorry but I do not see any reason for Ethereum to exist, all these altcoins look like get rich quick schemes to me. And no I am not afraid about my holdings, I am not married to Bitcoin FYI. If something else convinces me I will also invest in it. But for now no other coin seems remotely convincing.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:54:01
The fact that he has so much weight means that it is centralized. Anything that has a leader is centralized, by definition.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:49:00
Exactly, and even big communities such as the Ethereum community, are completely controlled by one dude.
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:06:30
No the core team cannot fork Bitcoin on a whim. if the entire Core Team is arrested and goes to prison tomorrow you know what will happen? Nothing. If the Ethereum foundation is put into jail tomorrow, it is over for Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:18:07
The problem is that Ethereum can't scale on chain, they will have to find off chain solutions (by Vitalik's admission). So then we get to the same problem we have with RSK, aren't we?
@_date: 2018-04-27 02:32:37
fuck this country
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:57:44
Also FYI this article is the preface of the book " The Bitcoin Standard " , by Saifedean Ammous, a Bitcoin maximalist who rightly considers all altcoins such as Ethereum as garbage.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:24:18
3rd party? What are you talking about? Everything is third party in a decentralized system. Bitcoin Core is actually third party. And the Ethereum foundation should be considered third party as well, but of course it is not because Ethereum is centralized.
What you said doesn't answer the problem you addressed. Ethereum will have the same off chain problems RSK has.
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:32:26
Yes. So now how is Ethereum a better solution for smart contracts than that?
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:15:28
And as I said before, if you read the book this article is extracted from, you will see that the author considers all altcoins as shitcoins. The book is called "the bitcoin standard" .
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:55:19
We are actually, it all started with OVO
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:30:15
lol you're so right
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:23:59
Please read the article
@_date: 2018-04-30 19:14:34
no it's not a duplicate of that link
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:13:13
I think that's where we disagree. You look at the technology alone, when I actually look at how safe my money is. To me it's not contingent, it's central.
Vitalik can push almost whatever agenda of hard forks he has, because he has near blind trust from the Ethereum community. Now it's almost impossible for the Bitcoin Core team to push a hard fork. It was a civil war for just pushing Segwit. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:12:37
Ok give me an example of one useful and used dapp, since you are talking about " use cases" .
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:00:05
Different use cases, are you talking about cryptocats? Because I am not aware of any other "different" use case.
@_date: 2018-04-08 06:30:54
Exactly, that's why I trust him.
@_date: 2018-04-30 00:18:49
This is shitcoin shilling, it has nothing to do on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:25:18
Looks like I hurt your feelings ;) If one dude can "convince major stake holders" and fork whenever he wants, that doesn't make feel safe about my money. Btw 2 days ago Vitalik proposed to stop making Ethereum inflationary. Guess what, it's probably gonna get implemented ;)
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:01:00
Really? Which altcoin doesn't have an authority that controls it?
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:56:14
Craig Wright is a fraud as well no doubt about that
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:19:21
The value of Bitcoin is fixed supply money that cannot be controlled by anyone. It's something that got built in the wild organically over 9 years. No other coin offers that or has the potential to offer that.
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:56:41
"For other cryptocurrencies to compete, they need to have such a Hayekian property" 
None of them have. All altcoins have an authority that can decide of their fate. Therefore currently no altcoin can compete according to Taleb.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:58:13
Have you heard of RSK?
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:23:46
Please read the article it says 5%
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:45:13
How is a centralized, editable, censorable, mutable knock off of Bitcoin not a fraud? Ethereum is marketing buzzword crap, it is a fraud.
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:32:43
Get real, 1 million is nothing for something that aims to be the world reserve currency. Bitcoin will either crash fast, or rise fast above 1M.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:35:52
What are you trying to say? That it is as easy to fork Bitcoin as it is to fork Monero? If that's what you're saying then we can stop the discussion now.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:11:24
Bitcoin's developer team has extremely low influence, remember that war to implement segwit? Do you think they can implement a hard fork? Looks almost impossible. Monero does not come close.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:59:08
You're the one ignoring reality, how can you pretend that something that has a leader is not centralized? How can something do " partnerships " with corporations and not be centralized? How a coin that is editable on the whims of Vitalik is not centralized? Why do you think ETC still exists?
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:16:03
He did with the DAO fork, he controls the development of Ethereum. You know that he has too much power in the Ethereum community, whatever he wants to push has a high likelihood of getting implemented.

@_date: 2018-04-28 23:28:49
I never said he's a bad coder, I'm sure he's an amazing programmer. Here is why he is a fraud:
1. Bitcoin is valuable because it's censorship resistant.
2. Bitcoin is censorship resistant because it's decentralized.
3. Bitcoin is decentralized because no one person, company, foundation etc controls it or represents it.
4. Centralized shitcoins like Ethereum are useless.
5. Ethereum is therefore a scam which only value is to fund more ICO scams.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:53:35
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:57:00
I think you don't understand my point. In 3 years Ethereum has not delivered anything of any use. And anything of any use doesn't seem likely to happen for the years to come. On top of that, dapps can also be built on top of Bitcoin. My point is that Ethereum is vaporware.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:17:41
wow amazing summary of how Taleb got rich, thanks for that!
