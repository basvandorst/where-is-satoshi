Ok thanks for the help. I'm gonna call some more banks tomorrow.

I'm trying to use a debit card, not credit. But I do have a Wells Fargo checking account, so I'll see about using that.
Edit: Not trying to wait 10 days to transfer the coin, but worst case scenario I might end up doing that.

Are you sure? I looked it up and found this on their website. 
"Digital currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and digital currency accounts and value balances on Coinbase are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation"
Edit: Only your USD account is insured. So maybe I could do a bank transfer to buy USD on Coinbase, and then use the USD to buy BTC?

I do have a checking account at Wells Fargo. Are you saying it'll work with a transfer, but not a debit card? Not saying you're wrong, that just sounds dumb that they would allow you to buy it one way and not another.
Edit: I think I can transfer money from my bank to my USD account on Coinbase. And then use the USD to buy BTC. I just don't wanna wait 10 days

Finally got it to work. I had to link my bank account, then deposit to my USD account. Then I could instantly use my USD balance to buy BTC. And for some reason the fees were much lower?
Edit: Fuck. I didn't know it takes 10 days to buy it this way..

I tried bro, but they told me that any bank which is FDIC insured will not allow cryptocurrency purchases. Which is like 99% of banks I'm pretty sure.

I'm trying to sign up for it, unfortunately it won't scan my damn ID. I contacted support

Ok, guess PNC just doesn't know what they're talking about. The girl was telling me that its a federal policy, not the banks, so any FDIC insured bank won't allow crypto, because it's too volatile and unstable. Which is a pretty fucking dumb reason IMO.. the bank wouldn't think twice if I blew all my money at the strip club lol. I'm gonna call some other banks tomorrow

Some banks just block the purchase of crypto. Every time I try to use my Wells Fargo card on Coinbase, it gets denied by the bank because it says the bank changed their rules regarding crypto. But I will look into the credit union if I can't find a bank.
