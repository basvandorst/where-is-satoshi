When is that calling for $1M/BTC?
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:27:45
Haha- okay fucktard- Wallstreet is trying to print BTC like they do dollar bills. You’re probably 16 thinking you won’t have to work at some point because you hold .04 BTC. These dudes are for real- they want to control everything. Novogratz is backing this- immediately a red flag. Dudes a wall street vet that has made many many millions off boobs like your dad that signed up for some amortization insurance policy. Did you listen to podcasts? I’m guessing you don’t know what a naked short is on paper? Wallstreet is smarter than you bonezzzzzzzz- go to sleep now 
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:22:09
That’s what you want with BTC?
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:44:26
Sorry for the fucktard comment. But she knows her shit. Why wouldn’t BTC being a legit asset class and being a formative way of adding value to ones 401k not be bullish- it 1,000% should. But the assfucks that control BTc know it will devalue the “store of value” thought and will just be another paper trade

The first contact will be physically delivered; however the rest- not so much!
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:48:19
You’re kidding right?
@_date: 2018-08-26 09:08:28
Excellent TA- I know lots are not open to that, but the fucking chart doesn’t lie- follow the dude on twitter and you have time to accumulate until the next big move in q4-q-1 2019-2020...be accumulating!
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:40:28
Because writing a paper “acknowledgment” that you own BTC is not why BTC was created. And that will be possible with custodial accounts that will be created. JPM will be able to sell you BTC without holder a fraction of BTC

it is clearly manipulated. That's not a question- the question is when does regulation step in and let btc fly high.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:34:27
Whats this mean exactly? Margin calls on shorts?
