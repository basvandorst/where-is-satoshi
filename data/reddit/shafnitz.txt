I tried cross-posting, but it was removed. I apparently did something wrong. Sorry.
This is the first time I've noticed this option in my Microsoft account. If you login to your Microsoft Billing account ( right below the option to "redeem a gift card" there is an option to "redeem bitcoins":

I've been using them for three years with the same bank account. Tried to buy some BC the other day and suddenly it wouldn't let me do an instant buy because my bank account "wasn't verified". I think I'm done with them too.

Thanks for this post. I had a very small amount of BTC left over here from a long time ago. I was able to get it back into my account by asking support (like I should have to do that in the first place) and now I've transferred it out of Cryptsy, so I'm completely done with them.
I can somewhat understand their reasoning with moving the balances to "cold storage". However, I don't really believe they're doing it in the best interest of their customers. Additionally, whether it's in the TOS or not, they should 1. be more clear that they're doing it, and 2. make it easier to get it back without having to send a message to support. If an account was compromised, whoever controlled the account could just as easily send the request to support. There should be a big banner notification indicating what happened to our balances and a one-click to restore it.
Lastly, I cannot fathom that the CEO of a company would seriously respond in the fashion above. It's nonsense. My 7-year-old could write a more coherent sentence than anything that guy wrote. It's embarrassing.
