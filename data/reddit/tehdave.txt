It has to become easier to use

Obviously panic sell if it drops $100

Ahhhh it’s been a while since I’ve smelled that sweet smell of FOMO in the air.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:09:19

I don’t know why you are getting criticized for this but I think it’s awesome. These young kids do not know a world without crypto and I look forward to seeing what they can accomplish with crypto as they become young adults with forward thinking parents like you.

How much btc do I get for watching Andreas Antonopoulos videos?
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:31:07
I remember a few months ago posts were about lightning network and other interesting projects. I miss that time.
