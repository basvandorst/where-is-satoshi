I mean. Yeah guys. We all just sortamaybe bought some shares in bitfinex. We all wanted to do that anyway right?
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:09:27
It's a shame they are not offering any sort of dividends or equity to holders and only the vague promise of "maybe we can buy them back" putting their maximum value at $1. Would be great if there was actually an incentive to hold.

@_date: 2018-01-15 05:59:27
I don't understand. Are you trying to sell me a backlit wall? Why do I need to light up my wall when I don't spend time whilst on the computer looking at the wall? (Also somewhat redundant when I think I have more screens than wall anyway).
Could I counter your "backlit wall" salespitch by suggesting that you should improve your boring black wall with some bright green glow in the dark paint? 
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:58:37
You should always be able to close your position though. If I got rekt by a platform failing at a critical time for me I would feel burnt. Hence why I have never touched bitmex.

Seems like quite a lot of Uphold hate here. It's the only place I get my btc through UK bank transfer inside a day with no fee or nonsense.

@_date: 2016-01-18 07:48:28
For just ~£60 you could run a full node on a Raspberry Pi 2 and forget about it :)
(including pi, plug, ethernet cable or wireless adapter, 8gb micro sd for OS/boot, 64gb USB for blockchain, hdmi cable)
@_date: 2016-01-03 15:50:03
I would also be interested in the associated fees with using a Xapo card in the UK
@_date: 2016-01-03 15:41:08
I'm pretty much the same. I used to get my btc through Circle in the UK but have since switched to Uphold. Seems pretty solid
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:49:44
"Right now it is plenty under 64gb therefore 64gb isn't enough" -You^
But yes, it obviously wouldn't be enough "forever". I wasn't trying to imply that. But it would work at the moment and it's far from difficult to use larger external storage for the blockchain. I was merely trying to suggest a cheap alternative for a completely separate full node.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:59:03
Ironically enough. They haven't changed any of the information on the profile.
h3rlihy-tw is still my Skype.. and I could confirm on there that my account has been stolen. I also attempted to advertise my shit youtube channel like 3 years ago on my forum account, would also be easy enough to demonstrate ownership of that channel
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:44:43
Yeah man it's made me feel super edgy now. Did not think I could just have my account stolen from right under me like that without as much as an email to the actual address I had registered with and used there for like 4 years
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:12:24
the 64gb usb is the only part that would need replacing. And is ~£15. Or are you one of those types that throws out their entire computer and buys a new one when they run out of storage?
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:45:06
Also interested in knowing associated costs here

Well that'll be how that happened then. Just got an email from "haveibeenpwnd" showing that bitcointalk pretty much leaked f*cking everything they had on everyone back in May 2015. Top notch.
@_date: 2019-03-01 23:26:32
I've been a bitfinex client for years. The 10k equity requirement is real yeah, because people trading $20 back &amp; forth are often the ones that send the most support tickets. I have never had any issues with them or sent them any documents. "Paid by an individual in btc for freelance work" could quite easily translate into "I smuggled an assload of cocaine across the world and got paid in stolen btc" so if anything flags that it could potentially be the latter, it's in the best interests of the private company you just sent what could be a large sum of stolen money to, to ensure that it isn't a large sum of stolen money. Which should be easy as pie to prove if it's not a large sum of stolen money :)
10btc is currently sitting at nearly $40,000. If I opened a bank account and immediately had $40k transferred in from a third party, they would likely freeze my account and ask me similar questions. Bitcoin has it's freedoms, but trading accounts with private companies ARE STILL accounts with private companies and they have to take reasonable steps to prevent themselves being complicit in crime

@_date: 2019-03-22 18:24:49
I think it goes to show the utter sheer incompetence of coinmarketcap that they have all of these fake exchanges listed when any idiot could look at the order distribution on most of them and see that they are just obviously making that shit up. Yet CMC is still perfectly happy to actually give them validity.
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:46:13
the point being man, $1.50 a day is still better than $0 a day. That would be a godsend to some people. Unfair employment still beats no employment.
@_date: 2018-10-15 23:01:44
The irony being you can pull shit like that on the basis of "meh, I don't really need that right now" and use a super low fee, chances are pretty good that you are STILL getting that shit within a week. With traditional finance, particularly large amounts, it could be months.. or just eventually.. or IF you provide this, this &amp; that. With crypto you can just move yer $194M in spare change and KNOW that it'll either turn up, or fall out of the mempool and bounce back to you

@_date: 2018-10-05 20:54:39
I recognise that. And I recognise that it would be unlikely. 18 months is only half of three years, that is not a huge distinction. My point being that I feel like it is very unlikely that he would be correct in terms of lightning becoming irrelevent, but the most likely scenario of this being true would potentially be a situation where lightning has been superseded by an even better lightning-derived network of sorts.

@_date: 2018-10-05 17:53:58
I think the most valid comment here that is actually in Vers favour is the idea that technology moves FAST. Especially in the crypto world. And 18 months is a LONG time. It is quite possible that in 18 months we'll have a waaaaaaaaay better solution that the lightning network was just the precursor to.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:45:48
I'm not massively against them here. I just feel like to add something like this to their terms of service so close to a fork that you couldn't move your holdings in time if you wanted is shady

I have had the exact same experience with polo customer support, and have since stopped using them. I received replies to support requests SO LATE that they were just no longer relevant at all.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:43:09
It is reasonable, sure. But on the DAY of the fork? When it would already be too late for most to remove their holdings before said fork within their limits? Wouldn't have necessarily been an issue if this was released a week ago but I feel like it's a bit last minute
@_date: 2016-12-19 14:09:31
Sucks that they had a UK bank account you could do standard transfers to in the early days. But then it was closed and not heard if that's possible again at all yet.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:44:07

@_date: 2019-02-03 17:55:13

@_date: 2019-02-08 01:42:46
On a similar note, over in the UK it is literally "normal" to be unable to login to NatWest Online to check your balances and transactions at certain times at night, most nights. Quite frequently I try to login just to keep my finger on the pulse just to get "haha no, maintenance". Banks are shit.
@_date: 2019-02-17 14:02:18
So basically pretty much just this?
Bitfinex has had OCO orders, trailing stop and plenty of other advanced orders for years.
@_date: 2019-02-03 18:49:36
But if anything you're just supporting my points? The trustless offering was built specifically so that anyone hesitant to hand over custody of funds due to past hacks could still trade no problemo directly with a hardware wallet and not have to worry about hacks. Which is the direction the industry could do with going in etc...
@_date: 2019-02-02 05:32:49
Blew my mind how hard everyone pushes for "cold store your coins, don't keep on exchanges" then cz encourages people on twitter to leave their funds on binance. Good job man. Good job.

@_date: 2019-02-06 22:54:04
"Denying you your funds is a feature not a bug". Cannot even believe they were that bold 0.o. There have been criticisms about slow fiat with bitfinex but I'd take that over being bent over the table like this anyday. Once you go down this path you can't go back.
@_date: 2019-02-03 14:12:10

Bitfinex have their cold wallets public, discourage people from storing funds on the exchange that are not being actively traded &amp; developed a hybrid DEX with  As much as there is a lot of animosity towards them, how is this not the exact direction crypto needs to be going in?
@_date: 2019-02-03 19:22:28
Literally nothing at all to do with EOS...
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:42:29
You seem to have taken this INTENSELY personally. I have no issue with your company and am not bashing you at all as you have accused me of in private message. Merely pointing out that implying there is no advanced order functionalities across crypto exchanges is not correct, when bitfinex has had many advanced order types for many years. If anything I am disappointed that what you have built does not also include them as I imagine the additional functionality you have built ontop of the existing most basic in the industry exchange offerings available would be very easy to also develop for finex.
You could have even really pushed the boat out and potentially looked at ways to develop your advanced functionality for  , the bitfinex hybrid dex that is available to everyone. This would have been a remarkable development to have seen third party contribution there.
I am not attacking you or bashing your work, just disputing that there is no existing available advanced order functionality in the crypto space currently. Although I accept that perhaps my initial response could have been interpreted as hostile.
I'd recommend thicker skin though, because if you really feel you have been targeted or bashed here, I can tell you now it can get a lot more unpleasant on the internet.
@_date: 2019-02-03 17:51:04
You what now? Finex haven't shilled anything at all lol. Please point me to where they do? They don't give a damn what you choose to trade, they just provide the strongest platform possible on which you can. Listings are not recommendations or shills and it is others that just list hundreds of trash etc? Please point me to where bitfinex are making trading recommendations in terms of what you should or shouldn't buy as opposed to being as agnostic as they possibly can?
@_date: 2019-02-03 14:04:50
Bitfinex is the only one that actively provides alternatives to access their orderbooks without giving up custody of your funds with the trustless offering though xD

It couldn't happen again tomorrow at all. It happened because multisig was trusted over cold storage.

@_date: 2019-02-23 01:56:29

Yeah I would have to also be on the side of just buying tether. Fighting it would be more expensive. Then if you have any tether related concerns you can cheese it around into other stablecoins, liquidate it on other exchanges, fiat offramp elsewhere one way or another but at least you would likely lose less value than fighting this.

Did you read my post lol? My point was not that they were the same, just that it is a bit of a liberty to say "small, portable and useful unlike existing hardware wallets"
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:28:27
done. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:14:51
I think it's just signalling an equilibrium being reached between the current price &amp; profitability of current hardware
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:59:50
Yeah unfortunately you are wrong here my guy. I'm a bitfinex supporter and I do trust them with my funds, but any crypto I'm not actively trading is kept in cold storage on hardware wallets. Yours should be too. You've only got to be wrong once about which third party you choose to trust.

Sounds like it only failed because the attacker couldn't have made what they were doing more obvious if they tried. A little subtlety and they might've been able to pull something off
@_date: 2018-07-18 21:52:20
If they're not busy having 'other things to do'

I was already planning on just naming my future kids bitcoin wallet addresses. Nobody would ever need to ask them for payment details
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:52:34
That is indeed quite irresponsible to pull the price from only one source
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:05:57
What a great ally to have though.

I personally think this is rubbish, and the trading volumes are potentially suspect. Double volume isn't that remarkable in this industry as it tends to be very boom &amp; bust. Finex had a spike of $500M volume in a single hour not too long ago and was at ~9B/24h in December. A brief doubling for some of these other platforms, is not so significant. I'd rather see the entire market actually sustain higher volume and not dip so low

Thankyou for this! Manually entering and updating the price sucks!

Coinbase are probably the last site I would want to have custody of my crypto assets.

As a user of both, I prefer the nano. It feels sturdier than the trez. The only shame is the chrome apps are a bit meh, but I believe that they are working on that

You can now get faster routing through this guy if you send him your ID, address, selfie, passport, work history and blood sample

It just seems so odd to see so many cryptos on these other exchanges achieving such monumentally high (albeit often brief) trading volume whilst not being seemingly discussed anywhere or traded in volume anywhere else.
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:31:20
Agree with this. "People buying cryptocurrencies expect them to gain value" :P

Legitimate volume like the recent EOS volume is clear as the volume is high across all exchanges. Comparing the volume distribution of seemingly legitimate high volume coins with some of the coins these other 'top three exchanges' reckon they are getting on their very much unheard of coins is very interesting.
 EOS.. everyone seems to care about EOS lately.. high volume everywhere, highest market share of the volume is like 15%.
But HMMMM, Project Pai you say Huobi? Everyone cares about this too now? To be trading over a hundred million $ of it in 24h?  Seems a lot like just huobi users care about project pai.. 97% market share. If it was all the hype you'd think there would also be some volume on bitfinex..
This often seems the case with these exchanges, they claim such super high volume but when you dive into it a lot of it is on incredibly vague pairs nobody has previously heard of. As much as finex have had ALL THE ACCUSATIONS, they are one of the few I actually see amongst the top 5 with consistently high volume that doesn't involve weird pairs I've never heard of but seemingly suddenly have tens to hundreds of millions worth of volume overnight.

It's just incredibly frustrating that they couldn't have just called their altcoin something else.
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:16:44
Anybody could do the same thing and have just as much 'control'.
@_date: 2018-07-15 07:53:31
As I actually found this thread first, here is the solution:
=SUM(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(IMPORTDATA(" "{"&amp;CHAR(34)&amp;"USD"&amp;CHAR(34)&amp;":",""),"}","")+0)
Stolen from here: 
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:32:19
From what this guy says it sounds like they didn't approve it because it wasn't America enough -.-
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:46:19
I feel like the volume is suspect. These 'top' guys always seem to have such unusual volume on really odd pairs, particularly new additions. I noticed one of them added one of these vague pairs around the same time as finex and magically had an enormous amount of volume whereas finex had close to zero. Sure you could argue 'hurhur nobody cares about finex anymore'.. but actually realistically if there really was such high demand for this particular pair, they would have captured some of that market share.

Since June. June. You know that was pretty recent right? :P

they essentially won't give up users data and the government don't like it

Does the moon have fibre though? :/
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:58:03
At this point it would be an actual plot twist if nothing happened and it was fine x'D
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:21:25
Ridiculous how much volume these guys still get when this happens every time
@_date: 2018-12-29 18:59:44
I was playing gamecube when I was 13, you are ahead of your time. Was going to suggest matching a bitcoin investment with a vanguard fund or something but I'm pretty sure you need to be 18+ for any of that.
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:41:46
Would also love to know this.
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:56:41
Leave it there if you want to use it for something. If you want to actually keep it though, well then hardware wallet.

It's not really entirely possible when proving the existence of assets doesn't disprove the existence of liabilities. There are plenty of labelled cold wallets floating about though, I know bitfinex have known cold wallets, but this in itself doesn't paint a full picture. Exchanges are for working / trading capital, cold storage is for savings.
