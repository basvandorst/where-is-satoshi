Man, if you were REALLY smart you would have picked up the ones that have the cartoon mouse on them.  Those ones are the real value holders!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:54:06
Psh, I wish.  All mine is going to credit cards.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:13:44
I just tell people what the price was when I bought in and tell them I'm not worried about the "crash".  It's just discount time.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:36:15
Lol didnt give them much of a loan this year, Only got $1700 back and my credit cards have a 11-14% interest rate...  
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:05:46
You spelled HODL wrong!
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:34:42
Exactly.  It's like a USB stick.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:29:48
Didnt he just recently say Bitcoin was good?  
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:15:13
Do you think they will try to get you to sell some of it so they can get ahold of your money?  Will they ask you for loans?  
Keep it to yourself.  This is YOUR money that you earned by making smart decisions.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:16:07
It's because if they get it right it proves that they are smarter than everyone else.  Emotional investors are in it for the I TOLD YOU SO!!!  This is a sign of "dumb money" entering the field.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:15:04
Probably.  Then it'll go up, then down again, then up again...  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:36
I sure hope so!!!  I doubt it but I'm gonna HODL!!!!

Wait, people actually store their crypto on Coinbase?  Guess I was a smart noob cause I got a hardware wallet after a month.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:10:02
Sweet, discount time!!
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:33:09
Happy cake day.

So you're telling me that somebody spent money they could have invested to change the mind of an ancient guy who doesnt even understand the internet?
Who gives a shit if Buffet doesn't think it's a wise investment?  
@_date: 2018-05-31 20:14:42
Because HODL!!!!
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:02:26
If we have another day or so of drops Im gonna sell out and rebuy when things start trending up.  I dont have very much and I'm still in the green but I'd like to keep it that way lol.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:11:56
Damn, beat me to it!!!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:38:13
Might also be the best decision you ever made.  Time will tell, I kick myself in the ass for not buying in on the 2 other occasions I thought about it.  If I would have gotten in then I'd be a millionaire but since I missed out now I'm a thousandaire!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:29:24
Im gonna hodl on and keep saying it.  Sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:46:25
The best time to start investing in Bitcoin was 2 years ago, the 2nd best time to invest in Bitcoin is today.  Dont bother with mining yet, just start buying coin and when you learn more then look into mining.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:01:34
HAH!!!  
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:08:13
I bought .6 of a bitcoin and came back 3 minutes later and saw that dip.  My heart skipped a beat until I realized that it'll come back up lol.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:19:56
HAHAHAHAH Yea, right.  Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:14:33
Awesome, I'll check into it.  Thanks for the info!!!
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:54:41
Ahh, I see what you mean.  Thanks for the input!
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:40:13
THE MOON!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:39:39
Wait so if I put $51.99 then I wont pay any fees?  If so thats awesome!

I just bought back in after selling at $6300... I expect BTC to fall to $5000.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:44:57
Motherfucker better panic.  He's not too far away from eating his own dick on national television.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:06:54
I'd join that sub!!!  I tell people that I'm investing in Bitcoin but Im not a koolaid drinker yet.  There's alot of scammers out there.
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:51:01
On the other hand, that's exactly what scares me.  I'm investing, I buy bitcoin weekly but it makes me nervous that alot of the other people who are sold on BTC have looked past all the problems and just accept a future where all the problems have been solved.  
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:55:55
What did you do to fix this?  The comment above yours got deleted.
@_date: 2018-07-05 21:22:09
Maybe it was the RBI that had him poisoned!!!  lol This guy is a train wreck, I wish he would stop talking about cryptos.
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:53:19
It will take a 50% price increase to fix my Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-07-05 22:25:32
Happy cake day!
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:01:03
Damn, Ibwas hoping the prices would stay low for a couple more months.  I'm selling my house and was gonna invest some of my profits into bitcoin :(
