@_date: 2017-05-27 22:14:20
He lacks basic math skills. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:09:24
I did. He's receiving from an external wallet. 
My guess: he owns this external wallet and is transferring back to Coinbase in an effort to sell back to USD to recoup his initial purchase amount.
He's trying to "be cool" by posting screenshots of the peanuts he has realized thus far. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:04:28
If you regret it, you purchased more than you can afford to lose.

Mining = taxed at ordinary income at fair market value. May be subject to SE tax. 
Sale of BTC = short term capital gain/loss (held 1 year or less, ordinary income) vs. long term capital gain/loss (held greater than 1 year, reduced rate)
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:00:36
Statement or question?
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:48:01
No. 1 BTC = 1 BTC. He wouldn't realize any gain or loss until he sells for fiat. Quite probable he's getting paid for a service or just transferring BTC from a different wallet he owns to Coinbase wallet.
