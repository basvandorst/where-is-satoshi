kraken has partnered with fidor bank in germany which tells me more about that exchange than i´d find on most others. it didn´t make me switch from bitstamp yet. after that statement i now have a face to the company and i like a face when it comes to trust. so a legit enough company to partner with fidor bank and a guy who makes sense gave me a good feeling, yes. what a moron thing to do.

I don´t understand why this post would get downvoted. Yes Bitcoin is not mentioned. BUT one of the world´s biggest mobile carriers is launching a service that is very similar (in the end user experience) to what bitcoin is at this stage. Average Joe is not going to get deep into money theory to appreciate the underlying meanings of bitcoin. So yeah, it´s definitely something worth being aware of.

Bitcoin isn´t really needed for remittances within Eurozone, because you can send money without any fees via SEPA within the Eurozone. 
*I just remembered that 2-3 weeks ago Italy introduced a 20% fee on all incoming money transfers. (You were allowed to request it back with a bunch of paper work.) However, I´m qute sure the abandoned it soon after introduction. Still shows that it free SEPA-transfers shouldn´t be taken for granted.

ok i guess some people have reasons not to become verified and have to deal with limits. it´s still the minority and a lot a people won´t trade with you. look at the market at any given time to see that unverified members pay a lot more. 
on top of this i rather do the bitcoin.de verification (post ident) than upload a scan of all of my documents to an exchange in russia or china.

1. This is an issue with bitpay and and it´s not even an issue. All it shows is you shouldn´t rely on bitstamp processing your withdrawal within 15 minutes. Use an actual wallet and the transaction will be broadcast within seconds. I can recommend "Bitcoin Wallet" App for Android to keep your change for buying stuff. If you don´t have an Android phone, use blockchain.info web wallet or something else. 
2. I actually had a similar issue with lieferservice.de (also takeaway.com) a while ago and the money was refunded without problems (in €, not BTC).

While this theory definitely would have ~~e~~affected the price, I think it doens´t necessarily mean that it would have inflated the price over time. After all there were a lot of people willing to buy BTC who ended up buying worthless GOXBTC, 750k of them. These people, at least some of them, would have bought somewhere else, driving the price up, instead of emptying their fiat in Mark magical recovery fund.

wait now... 6 blocks an hours means 52560 blocks a year with the current reward that´s 1.3 million BTC a year. to make it easy let´s say there are 13 million BTC now, so there´s an inflation rate of 10%.
if this was the only thing affecting the exchange rate, it should decrease 9.1% (assuming there´s not inflation in the $ money supply). the value of the 13 million BTC is now distributed among 14.3 million BTC.
this is a price we all pay for participating in bitcoin. it´s not only paid for transactions, but for keeping the system running and secure. 
and it´s actually very fair since everyone participating pays a fair share as it´s automatically deducted off everyone´s stake.
**TLDR: The price to keep Bitcoin running is paid by all BTC-holders, not only by those making transactions. We´re all paying miners to do their thing by accepting the inflation and giving us the ability to do transactions anytime we want.**
@_date: 2014-05-24 15:49:42

they launched a massive pr-campaign that brought a lot of exposure to bitcoin. it all looked very promising with cypress predestined for a new financial system. 
now if this turns out to be another scam a lot of people - politicians, regulators, the university of nicosia... - would be left abandoned by some bitcoin-scammer. not cool.
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:55:26
no, in my case the payment went through but the restaurant never received an info about my order for some reason. it sucked because i was waiting for my food and thought they´d received my order. anyway, root of the problem wasn´t really bitcoin related and i got my money back via SEPA bank transfer.

The more enthusiastic you get about Bitcoin/blockchain technology, the more you will get into this kind of situation. Always keep in mind how much YOU had to read and watch with an open attitude before you could grasp the implications of this technology.

it feels like in order to answer this question some conditions need to be formulated:
- do we ignore interest payments on the current debts/the debts in general? (for example i think German interest payments nowadays are on a level where it takes a little over half of all tax incomes just to pay off those loans.) 
- are you talking about a scenario where everybody dumped their fiat and the government is now accepting crypto for taxes?

paying in bitcoin via bitpay = cashing out. anyone dealing with btc would expect nothing other than getting $ back in case of a refund. or - and this could also be done risk free - BTC equivalent at the exchange rate when claiming the refund. very logical solution in my eyes. returning money in BTC is actually something bitpay should offer in my eyes.

let me explain further: if your client sets up an account at bitpay he will be able to create an invoice that request exactly 95$ and after you paid he will receive that 95$ in his bank account from bitpay (2-3 days!? not sure how fast it is in the US). no need for him to deal with bitcoin himself.
you on the other haver to buy the btc and then pay the invoice obviously.
this way you will get a payment receipt for the transaction.

I just helped my friend set up a Bitcoin donation address. She drove from Germany down to the border Greece/Macedonia (Idomeni) and is helping there with cooking and all sorts of things. You can read more in the original post on facebook here: 
We have it set up so she will receive Euros for all BTC donations and directly use it for the cause. This is not to pay for her expenses, but directly to buy the things that are needed in the camp.

don´t do it, there´s no reason to. put you money on stamp or one of the other places. coins are cheaper there anyway. i had 3 SEPA withdrawal requests pending. i canceled them during the last crash and bought btc that i luckily was able to withdraw right away. it´s a great feeling not to have your funds tied up on gox. think about it... yes, you could sell 10 btc on gox for $200 extra on gox. but by the time you see the money the price will likely be way above whereever you sold at. either way, i don´t think the 6% extra you get on gox are worth the hassle.

TLDR: It´s an article from a fairly big and reliable German newspaper. They are quoting the head economist of Commerzbank (Germany´s 2nd biggest bank) who sees no future in bitcoin because of its volatility and thus unusefulness for people to use.

I understand what you´re saying, but for the moment we´re going to have to work with workarounds that need to charge fees. So far the best I could think of was all4btc and they charge 5% so this is a step in the right direction. Soon enough services like this will hopefully become obsolete :) Meanwhile I wish you guys the best and will check use it thankfully!

in germany: if you use your BTC directly to buy stuff there´s no tax on the capital gains. you obviously have to pay VAT on the item, but this is done by the merchant. your BTC gains are only taxed if you cash out to € within 1 year of holding.

Not really. Your **bitcoin is money** statement kind of sums it up. Bitcoin is not money the way we know it today and thus the statements you make about money don´t really apply to bitcoin. To me at least being obsessed with bitcoin has sort of a noble purpose.
For some insight watch [this]( (whole thing is worth the watch, but i really recommend at least those 2 minutes that i linked)
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:10:56
yeah ok i get that. but wouldn´t it make sense to have a "fair-trade"-kinda marketplace that isn´t after profit. it could be run by fees and thus be reliable and secure. it wouldn´t allow bots though. this would make bitcoin less attractive for pump and dumps and whatever it is that bots cause. so this way the price would be more stable but nothing is lost because really the greater good doesn´t need people getting rich off of daytrading bitcoin, causing panic sells and giving bitcoin the image of an unreliable technology. 
i think this would actually be a good idea. the whole company or exchange could be transparent and financed by the community via fees. 
in the long term i think we won´t need exchanges anymore though. the technology has a lot of potential that is not even being used yet. one of those features would and most likely will make exchanges unnecessary.

well it´s only in the currency converter for now, but still good news.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:43:33
yeah i had to pause and calculate right there. 6 transactions/hour with a 25 BTC block rewards means 1.314.000 BTC/year. let´s say there were 11mio in the beginning this is an inflation of ca. 11.8 %. now you could subtract some lost coins and probably have a smaller money supply than 11mio so 2 % is far off. i don´t think it matters much though in the bigger picture. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:12:36
wait now. 20%? the past couple of days the price difference was about 10%. also 4 weeks are no more than a guess. there have been rather quick small withdrawals, but there are also a lot of examples of withdrawals taking far more than that. especially larger ones. 
two times was my withdrawal stuck and by the time i got it the price on bitstamp was already higher than what i had bought at in the first place. i would certainly not recommend this loop!

Hello from Germany! :) First of all thanks for doing this! 
Here are some thoughts on the hearings.... I don´t think that the hearings should be given much more attention than in the current version. After all it was only *hearings*. And after all the US are only *one* country. I definitely think that they were very important as whatever is happening in the US is generally something the whole world looks at. At the same time it´s the general article on bitcoin and not the American (Correct me if I´m wrong). 
While I´m at it: Should there be a section about the protocol/technology aside from the currency/payment system-part of bitcoin? The article starts off calling bitcoin "peer-to-peer digital currency". I am not the right one to make a good a case about it, but to me bitcoin is a protocol, a technology and an idea at first. The first use of it (and looking at the whitepaper definitely the most intended use) that people see is a currency. It makes sense, it´s called bit*coin*. But still after reading this article the reader should at least get a feel that the idea behind bitcoin really can be a game changer in many ways. That would probably end up sounding pretty circlejerky, but to me it belongs in there because it really is difficult to make a good well-informed argument against bitcoin being exactly that.

what is the pro of allowing bots? i mean ok i get that they cause a lot of volume and it makes sense for mtgox to allow that because they make more money when there´s more action. however, if this is the only reason it´s not gonna be acceptable in a future where bitcoin is widespread. or am i forgetting something?

@_date: 2013-10-15 06:24:47
obviously not, but i thought i don´t need to explain stuff that also applies for regular voting procedures. here in germany you usually have to do pretty much exactly what i described anyway: either you go to the booth on election day (about 80% of all voter do this) or you ask to get the paperwork send to your home at least 2 weeks (or something around that) in advance. about 20% do this because they´re lazy or know they won´t be able to make it to the booth. if you apply for the mailing-version you obviously don´t get to vote again as your name gets crossed out. and if you show up at the booth for the 2nd time you same thing applies.

You mean your business accepts bitcoin but noone buys anything with it? If so, I wouldn´t worry about it. The price has been going up so much that people just hold. I personally use bitcoin whenever I can and "refill" my stash afterwards. In the long run with more exchange rate stability this won´t be a problem anymore - and if so it´s not the worst problem to have :) I am confident that this will change though. First of all a lot of things are cheaper, safer, faster with bitcoin so there will be an incentive to use it as a simple replacement for "normal" transactions. But on top, and this is where it really gets interesting, there will be things that were unthinkable because simply impossible to do before bitcoin. I am excited to see what things people come up with using this technology.

this sounds too complicated. it shouldn´t, but it does. 
after worrying, researching and so on here´s what i did: buy a netbook (around $150), install lubuntu, transfer secure bitaddress.org, create and print a bunch of paper wallets. put half of the coins on want to store on those. create more addresses and safe in notepad file. encrypt file and safe it in several places. put the other half on those. if you have a laptop or buy a used one it´s really easy to do.

that is false information. i don´t have an iphone but know my friends have used them to pay in a bar. i think there´s something else that makes it work without breaking apple´s app policy. afaik it has to do with the coins not being stored on the phone. so basically the app is only accessing your online wallet on blockchain.info. either way i´m sure works!

i have been thinking about the following:
1 - find a community that has a mayor in place that you could convince of trying something awesome
2 - develop a bitcoin-clone that meets the following criteria:
 
a: a fixed amount of X adress, where is is the number of citizens of voting age, and
b: 1 coin on each adress
3 - have all citizens who want to participate come get their paper wallet
4 - create a website where citizens can anonymously submit suggestions on projects/things to do with
5 - a budget of Y dollars that will be spent according to the distribution of the coins.
i am no programmer, but i think that from the technical side it should be possible to make changes on the protocol to meet the requirements for this. all it would need is a community with an open minded mayor/council that can come up with a test balloon amount of $10.000 or something and obviously some consulting and technical support in advance to create the new protocal. 
if this happened and people say build a new playground from the money that would be a pretty good example to show the idea of a bitcoin-based protocol with a public blockchain and so on could be secure, secret, easy, transparent, fair and whatnot. who wants to do this? :)

hi everybody,
with all the worrying about security i have decided to buy a netbook and make it my offline security center. i want to use it for different things:
- cold storage
- printing paper wallets
- storing all my passwords 
- writing my very personal journal :)
i think that if we turn this into a more general how-to, a lot of people might appreciate these instructions. 
some questions that come to my mind: 
- should it be a new netbook or could i buy second hand?
- should i install linux
- what´s the best way to protect the netbook?
- how about backups? encrypted usb-stick?
thank you!

maybe mining more than what you´d need to meet the price at the current exchange rate is not the motivation behind this. would it make sense to buy this in order to be able to doa 51% attack. say if you installed a lot of hardware and put it all online at the same time?! this is not saying that is what happened, i wouldn´t be able to make a good gues. but since the value of the coins that will be mined doesn´t add up to 50k$ there must be another explanation...

matt i really enjoy your stories. the legal situation in general is pretty complex and often uncertain. as some people pointed out already there were some false statement. 
let me tell you that in germany there is NO extra VAT on bitcoin transactions! there are quite a few places that accept bitcoin just like € and it really doesn´t make a difference what you use. either way you´ll pay 19% "Mehrwertsteuer"/VAT. 
concerning bitcoin as an investment it´s basically treated like gold which means you´ll have to pay capital gains tax IF you sell it within 1 year after purchase. 
this information was published as an official statement after one politician requested clearity on these issues from the government.

why would you compare the logic behind buying btc to that behind buying a lottery ticket. odds of winning the lottery are like 1/140million. on the other hand, as much as i try to get some perspective in threads like this, i can barely come up with anything *but* bitcoin being very successful and paradigm-shifting. i´m aware that different things bear a risk (51%, regulation, glitch, altcoin...), and i am by no means putting house on it. but at the same time i think that the success of bitcoin is the most likely outcome. it´s kind of hard to comprehend, but eventhough there are some things that could go wrong, i don´t really them it happening, at least not anytime soon.

The Chinese uprise in bitcoin has become more important and influential to the community in the past months/weeks and here´s some background info on general financial situation the world is facing witha focus on China.*
TLDR: While the world is looking mostly at the US and what the FED is doing, Chinese banks have been acquiring shitloads of money and pumping the US markets a lot more than the FED with QE.

gox really is an interesting story... nothing really would surprise me. they could be one headline away from being back in the business (withdrawals happening, midas rocking), but at the same time i wouldn´t be surprised if they announced bankruptcy tomorrow. i am wishing them the best because i used to play magic and usually magic players are good people.

i am going to make some questionable statements for the sake of the discussion: i am having trouble imagining a scenario where bitcoin covers 10% of world trades as an "end scenario". if it really got that far it would probably not stop at 10%. this is the reason for talks like [this]( 
why? in a scenario like this it´s likely people will get paid in bitcoin. the only reason not to use it would be taxes, but then again there most likely either be services that let you pay taxes in btc - or, even more likely, the entire tax system of most countries would have to change. (higher VAT but no more income tax?!). 
so that 10% share of world trade would either not happen or be a step towards total overtake. 
back to the original question... there would be a few early adopters simply stupid rich making bill gates look poor. can´t really argue with that. all those people with as "little" as 100 btc would be insanely rich. all of this wealth would be defined in btc though. these people don´t own any real assets yet though. 
the amount of bitcoins in their accounts will NOT increase by itself though. sure they might run businesses that earn money, but that´s quite the difference compared to today´s world. you don´t simply get richer by being rich. noone is in debt in the bitcoin world. banks cannot be simply bailed in by creating debt (actually banks become obliterate/reduced to essential functions). 
on top of all this there is a very soft argument that might give hope: the kind of people owning large amounts of btc now are probably more generous than today´s wealthy, have less connections to politicians, big corporations and so on. again, very vague argument, but it has some truth to it.

"Distributed Autonomous Corporation" - Bitcoin DAC is the first one. 
"Distributed Autonomous Corporations (DAC) run without any human involvement under the control of an incorruptible set of business rules. (That’s why they must be distributed and autonomous.) These rules are implemented as publicly auditable open source software distributed across the computers of their stakeholders.   You become a stakeholder by buying “stock” in the company or being paid in that stock to provide services for the company.  This stock may entitle you to a share of its “profits”, participation in its growth, and/or a say in how it is run."
exciting stuff! start here: 
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:06:46
This might be true for the transition phase. After that it should get interesting. You cannot print more bitcoin. So your stash will not increase over time simply by keeping it in cold storage. Their value will, but not the amount. The consequences of this along with the obsolescence of big parts of the financial sector and all the wealth that is non-beneficially created/taken ("seignorage" is an interesting thing) there should lead to a more benefitial distribution of wealth. The consequences would be felt like a rat´s tail though all fields.
@_date: 2013-10-15 06:58:33
well i was trying to make a point with this post: when coming up with utopia like a votecoin system you shouldn´t limit the debate by referring to "the fact that the people who get elected gain power who no-one is suited for". 
instead one could come up with ways to reduce the power of those elected peopl. hell, we could even say: whoever wants to have a road build or a thing done can open a transaction out of that state-wallet. and the transaction will be triggered if more than 50% of all people agree that it should be by using the votecoin event. 
now i know people have better stuff to do than vote on small purchases made with tax money and so on. at the same time this shouldn´t be the end of thinking this through. the way democracy is organized is simply outdated!

I think the way they handle this depends on the case. I have had this situation and after I provided proof of the SEPA transaction and the seller didn´t respond for 3 days they set my coins free. Maybe it was relevant that I have Gold status (a lot of transaction with no complaints).

@_date: 2013-10-14 21:41:18
i have come up with a very similar concept myself and i think that it could be secret. 
the most basic way of making this secret would be to simply have a shitload of sealed paper wallets waiting in a jar on election day. every citizen walks past a table where he first has to identify himself a a legal voter and then gets a random paper wallet out of the jar to then have the qr code scanned in a voting booth. he can take the code home and see check on democracycoin if his coin went to the intended votee without revealing his identity. 
edit: and this is a very uncreative way of making it secret just to make the point. the paper wallets could also be send out via mail and the citizens could vote from any computer on a website or at the local voting booth (for those untechy people).
i believe that if democracy shall still be the way to do handle things in the future some sort of technology like this could eventually no longer ignored in the long run

dude i´m with you. i´m not able to judge for myself as i don´t know enough about what would actually need to happen for a 51-attack to really hurt bitcoin. so i have to trust the community on this one. and if what op is saying true, then i really hope that this spreads and it would certainly help the cause if "someone influential" would adress all miners openly about it.
as to who that "someone" could be i hope you can help me out. if it´s not the bitcoin foundation then who would be the voice people would listen to for the greater cause?
i have been wondering about this anyway. last time that fork happened some people obviously had influence on the community and i was actually prest in the irc dev chat to read what was going on.  
what power do those guys really have? the ones that develop an upgrade of the mining software? what do we know about them? could they become a threat (when blackmailed?)? please tell me something to get rid of these thoughts :)

i had a similar idea but got to posting it: 
create a promotional flyer that gives info on bitcoin and instructions to:
- download a wallet to your phone
- scan the paper wallet that's printed on the flyer
- import the 0.01 btc
- show some donation-worthy projects like seans outpost and a way to donate that 0.01 btc
the people will see how easy it is to use in general, but more specific how easy you just paid for food for homeless or whatever on the othe side of the planet. 
of course they can spend the btc somewhere else, but that would be fine as well.

if there really was a kick ass bitcoin commercial during superbowl one could speculate that it would lead to an increase in price. so basically you could have the community lend you a shitload of bitcoin at the current $-rate (you write down everyone´s $ amount). you tell your film crew and the superbowl agency that they will be paid shortly after superbowl (and show a shitload of bitcoin as a security). superbowl comes, kick ass commercial airs, bitcoin goes up, you sell the shitload of bitcoin to pay back your lenders in $ (so less bitcoin). you still have money left over to pay the commercial and the film crew. go.

ok how about this. let´s go a bit further and have special wallets where tax/public money is collected. if politicians want to spend money from this adress the transaction will only be triggered if certain criteria are met. (this is programmed into the adress, i actually think that this would technically be possible, but if not in bitcoin it could probably be in some government-clone).
these criteria could for example be the result of a vote on the official votecoin (i actually like to call it democracycoin). this would put politicians in a position where they acutally have to convince the majority of the voters that the spending or budget is reasonable. the real debate now would be to find criteria for different usecases.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:35:32
It´s confusing, but I think third party processors only became this relevant after it was clear that banks won´t be allowed to transfer money to bitcoin exchanges.

I have been asking myself the same question a couple of times. 
I think that scenario where there really are a great percentage of BTC gone forever in the ocean the thing that would suck the most is that noone would ever know about it (except for the one throwing...). It obviously will get less over time (people dying without handing along the wallet for example), but those won´t make that much of a difference i think. 
So I don´t think that just buying a shitload and holding on to them would have influence. In a scenario where bitcoin is widely accepted I like to think that the price gets more stable as well. So it doesn´t really matter that much. What matters in the end is that the amount of stuff I can get with my paycheck doesn´t get less. Then it won´t matter if the BTC/US $ rate is 1/10.000 or 1/1.000.000.
At the same time I like to think that at some point there´s no need for "cashing out" because you already did cash out when you bought bitcoin. :) When you can buy everything with them there´s no need to exchange them anymore.
So back to your original question: I see no harms in having a big amount of BTC out of the system. In an end-time-scenario this amount would make you and a bunch of other super-early miners super-rich like never seen before. Basically you would own a country the france (i just made this up). So that kind of money in the wrong hands could be a bad thing, yes.

hey can you post or pm me what it says in there? i can´t login because google authenticator isn´t working. thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:01:43
thanks, i made a new backup!

And thinking about it now brought up another question. Check it out: 
Seems like 2 million coins have not been touched since the very beginning and might be lost already :)
@_date: 2013-10-07 09:24:36
no idea what i´m looking at. all i see is a huge 4:20 :D

btcchina is still well in between gox and bitstamp. i know they used to be on the higher end of that, but a couple of days ago they rose more than bitstamp/gox so it´s kind of back to the "normal" spread.
i just did some serious math and it turns out USD really has gone up more than CNY 
last 7 days: bitstamp +50.3%, gox +48.6%  CNY +42%
the price is still above bitstamp though

not that i could think of. i went on  and had a brand new "account". i deposited some btc and started gambling, made a bookmark with the "secret-link". i gambled away in a few sessions and today i went on there to see the money was gone. :( also i saw that the thief must have gambled a little himself, because i am sure i never made it to 1.6 btc which is the amount that was withdrawn.
@_date: 2013-03-21 13:41:54
this is what i was asking myself. they seem pretty confident that there won´t be a problem and i don´t really get why. ideas?

This is the bitcointip documentation:

yeah that´s my point... we´re already in a situation where they´re all doing the same thing. it´s already happening. so yeah, people in argentina might prefer the dollar, but how long is that gonna last with QEinfinity and so on. bitcoin_bitches!

people have been able to withdraw bitcoins for more than 2 months and so far it worked for everyone.. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:14:46
i have posted before that i am thinking about going away for some time and leave my coins in cold storage. so yeah, i´m kind of jealous, although i was thinking more like half a year :)
enjoy the time offline and have fun checking the price after those 2 weeks...
@_date: 2013-10-17 08:59:45
i think in theory all of this might be true, but at the same time (again, i am talking about  germany) i think it makes sense to look at the case and wager paying for a lawyer against the seriousness of the case and likelyhood of you getting in trouble. what i mean is that on several occasions i had to make statements at the police and never got a lawyer, also never got in trouble. it really depends on the case and your story.
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:10:27
working for me!
@_date: 2013-10-17 20:45:54
i have been waiting more than 4 weeks on my withdrawals in € so i wouldn´t do this.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:52:55
even better! :) i´m just hoping eventually we´ll all be able to pay directly anywhere with btc...

one link i remebered: 
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:46:17
maybe someone2 floors higher realized that showing matt discover bitcoin for 12 days would be unintended, huge advertisement for bitcoin. 
or maybe he actually got an android phone and wanted to say on the air why he did so. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:55:50
yeah i thought about something like this as well. anyone (of my friends) who sets up a bitcoin wallet and calls me on skype will be given 10$ worth of bitcoin. it´s pretty sweet to simply hold your phone to the camera and - kaching - money sent. 
at the same time i feel that most people would not care about 10$ enough for this to be a success :/
@_date: 2013-10-10 11:21:01
how come i never see stats for bitcoin.de? is it because they don´t publish this data? i know they have a different approach compared to all the other exchanges, but still it´s a pretty popular exchange here in europe. and also to me by far the most trustworthy! 
@_date: 2013-09-28 11:51:39
False. The guy (Frank Schäffler) requested a statement from the ministry of finance. This statment (or better these statements) deem bitcoin private money. Unfortunately the statements were published in German, but Frank Schäffler also put some information in English on his website. [Find out more here.](

taxes on gold have been rising in india. there´s definitely demand for some store of value. should be interesting to see them enter bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:44:05
avoiding taxes isn´t the reason people like bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:30:49
bitcoin works so much easier though. once you start using it on your phone all you have to do is literally scan a qr code. i know, once you´re set up with flattr is just a mouse click, but first you have to be set up. for bitcoin this is simply one of a lot of things that become more likely. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:25:18
how about a QR-code for bitcoin donations?

@_date: 2013-09-20 12:41:04
I want to make sure if I get it right:
Are the shares going to be sold at 0.003 fixed price at BitFunder? Or would place the buy order at 0.004 give me a higher chance of getting shares, but of course I´d have to pay the 0.004/share. I am wondering because there are orders wayyy above the 0.003/share (like 0.05!!). 
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:45:50
i agree. and really all that needs to happen for "the" price to increase and the entire market cap go up several 100mio $ is a bullish trend at mtgox. that´s where the price is made for all bitcoins.
right now i could buy BTC for 1mio $ and raise the price from 165 to 170 at mtgox - increasing the market cap by about 60mio $ (5*11.000.000) and the amount of coins added to the system today were no (meaningful) part of the equation.

I´m pretty sure this post wasn´t done by Simon. Maybe he will read here anyway, who knows.

how about them simply not showing the lag?
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:43:56
i recommend a different approach: in my eyes in the future there will be things where you will save money simply by paying for it in bitcoin instead of  $. one easy example is make an international money transfer. the more you get into the technology part of bitcoin rather than the currency part the more you will come to understand this and come up with all sorts of things that will become easier and even more interestingly now possible with this technology. the conclusion can only be that at that point it will make sense for anyone to ~~buy~~ exchange your $ into bitcoin in order to get things cheaper/get things at all. so with this in mind you can exchange some of your $ into bitcoin to use in the future. and with this in mind holding your bitcoin during a "crash" will become the "conservative" investment strategy, as in: by not selling and buying back in you are playing it safe and not risking any of your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:02:05
ha, i was doing the exact same thing. only to me it showed the qr code, transaction is online but never was confirmed. 15 minutes are up, bitpay down. sucky sucky. i´m opitimstic that this will get sorted out though.
@_date: 2013-10-24 20:58:40
sign up on bitcoin.de! to me it´s the most trustworthy exchange out there. it´s german and the guy who runs it it very well out in public and so on. it´s not good for daytrading, but you can always transfer BTC to bitstamp...
the reason it´s not good for daytrading is that you have to do SEPA transfer to the seller everytime you buy coins. the coins are frozen until he says he got the money. obviously all users are verified and theat takes a couple of days. also privacy and so on.. but if you want easy, safe and cheap coins go there. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:28:31
thanks for the answer. i talked to some people on the bitcoin-chat and they pretty much said the same thing.
so basically we need a new client that supports this feature OR this feature needs to be added to an existing client.
unforunately i am far away from being able to do this myself. 
maybe we should crowdfund this feature. crowdfunding to allow crowdfunding... :)

ha, this reminds me of good ol bitcoin24.com :) let´s hope it works out alright
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:39:36
it was a mistake as it obviously should have been 0.035 BTC and you can actually see the transaction here: 
edit: I scanned the QR-code and made a donation so i checked out his wallet. since he said he had already bought a pizza and this is the only outgoing transaction i´m pretty sure that´s the one.
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:21:33
bitstamp didn´t even have money coming in thursday and friday because of some holidays in slovenia where their bank is. so that adds to the rest.
edit: i actually have a feeling that the guy beneath might be right and we´re going to see quite an exciting week with a new all time high. there definetly has been a lot of attention and in order for a rally to happen we need to see new money on gox, bitstamp or btcchina. those are the only 3 places that matter. during the past rally this shifted from gox-only to a pretty leveld situation between those 3 exchanges ( i personally think that gox still has a little bit of a leading role, but they´re almost even). 
so new money has to come into those 3 places because all the money that already *is* in one of those places has pretty much found it´s level at 200ish. now realistically i don´t see a single reason to wire money to gox anymore as the coins are still 5-10% more expensive. that leaves us waiting for bitstamp to get new money in which should happen all through next week. 
when you look at the market depth you see that on gox it would only take 17k BTC to bring us to $250. on bitstamp it would take 15k for $240. /i know that it wouldn´t happen with a single order and so on, but those numbers at least give a little info on what kind of money we´re talking about.) so really we´re waiting for bitstamp or btcchina to see new money. i am putting the pressure on bitstamp this time around because btcchina must still be exhausted from the latest rise in volume. the fact that bitstamp wasn´t processing orders on thursday and friday really does add to this. it´s a reasonable explanation i think. 
and when you take a look at [this graph] ( you see that it really would be nothing more than staying on the 4 year trend that bitcoin has seen.
so altogether i feel like it the only logical conclusion (in a black swan free world) can be that we´ll be seeing a new all time high rather sooner than later. at the same time the magnitude and level of awesomeness of that happening always keep me sceptical. it can be no more than a good guess after all.
