As a "bitcoin guy" I've noticed lately people come up to me and ask me about it.. Maybe I'm just one of those rare shy BTC fans.

Yeah everyone is complaining about this GDAX/Coinbase collusion over BitcoinCash pump &amp; dump and I'm over here just wishing my job paid me better so I could buy more BTC/LTC/ETH (Possibly BCH when the price corrects)

I'd argue that we are broke because we don't make enough to have any expendable cash (AKA living paycheck to paycheck). But maybe that's just my current situation.

Terrible bank... They gave me a predatory car loan, I wouldn't even want them handling my fiat.

Could PayPal utilize the crypto market? Or are they not able to because of regulations?
