Futures have value because they are a contact to buy a physical product for a specific price in the future.  If I own a cruise ship I'm booking passengers out months in advance, I might buy futures contracts on oil as insurance price on oil going up.  Yes people speculate in futures but most investors use them as a hedge for volatile price swings.  Bitcoin is almost pure speculation.

You don't have to know how to build a house to calculate if it has value and is a good investment, if I said I believe housing is a bubble you wouldn't say you don't understand how to build a house, you would give financial arguments, population growth, lower supply as homes wear out, increases in material cost.  No one is arguing fundamentals of bitcoin as an investment, just say it's going up because you don't understand the technology is not an argument

Thanks, for polite discussion and disagreement, I would just counter that I don't have to be an expert in the underlying technology of an investment to understand the fundamentals of a good prudent investment.  For example I don't have to understand how a home is constructed to be an expert real estate investor.

Berkshire didn’t take any bailout money.  They had 20 billion in cash, no debt when financial crises happened and actually were perfectly positioned to take advantage of situation. picked up great investments like 10% Harley Davidson Bonds and 9.5% preferred stock from Goldman Sacks.

That’s not true he actually he saw as a buying opportunity, you can read his annual letters to stock holders and listen to annul meetings around the crash.  He did say he thought the fed and government acted accordingly to stop the panic, but he never needed or asked for a bailout.  If you read and listen to what he says again and again he doesn’t care what stock prices do in the short run. He describes the market a drunken farmer who at the bar gives you the chance to buy his farm at ridiculously high price one week and a ridiculously low price the next.  His strategy is to know how much the farm produces and what it is truly worth, and buy it when the price is ridiculously low.  That’s why he made so much money in the crash. 
Crypto is like the drunken farmer at the bar that offers to sell you magical beans one week for 20K and 4K the next.

Just because people get the idea to trade cat turds back and forth bidding up the price doesn’t make it a good investment.  Bitcoin is not an investment it’s a payment system and would work no better a .01 per bitcoin than 10 million per bitcoin, oh and it is a super inefficient payment system at that.  
And Warren Buffet never spoke against the tech industry he just said it was too hard to value,  he said he didn’t understand it well enough to risk his stock holders money and he was proven right as no one knew if yahoo Netscape, ask, aol or google would come out on top, and if you would have invested in a basket of random tech companies you would have lost money.  But you can make a reasonable assumption that billions of people have purchased Coca-Cola for 100 years and that they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
But anyway best of luck to you and I hope you can find someone to buy your cat turds at an even higher price in the future.

One your not an expert because you watched a couple of YouTube videos on the subject and second even experts can be wrong, 
People can be irrational for a long time especially when they see their friends and neighbors make money in something they get envious and rush in.  But rational economics always wins in the end crypto is not investing its speculation. You can speculate on Land, Bennie Babies, Crypto, or cat turds. Investing is buying into income producing assets like businesses or rental real estate.
Can you get rich quick speculating? Sure, but you can also loose it all, and are much more likely to lose money than to make money.  Suggest you read the Millionaire Next door, and the Intelligent Investor.  Learn from real people who made it and  more importantly kept it.

Don’t get me wrong there are plenty of villains in the crash, and Personal watched Regions go after and bankrupt one of my friends while taking billions from tarp and giving bonuses to executives.  But no evidence that Berkshire participate in the CDO markets during run up, or participate in bailout.

First, yeah a good answer to Venezuela currency crisis and failed state is to use a currency that requires electricity to clear transactions with you know the rolling blackouts and all. 
Second does fiat suck yes no argument there.
But you do need individuals to trade a certain amount of their labor to acquire an asset, fiat will always be an asset because you have to acquire enough of it to pay your taxes.  Unless your a failed state like Venezuela.  Bitcoin only gets its value from how much labor the marketplace is willing to trade to obtain it.  At some point you will run out of those individual.

I'm actually not a big fan of gold either, but was just pointing out it does have utility, and while central banks do use it as a store of value most individuals buy it and enjoy it as Jewlry, I didn't buy my wife's wedding band hoping it would go up in value. If gold goes down in value they stop mining it, people who like jewelry and coins buy more of it, it's used more in electronics as it gets cheaper than other equivalent metals until there is equilibrium, or it's gets overvalued then they start mining it again.  Bitcoin on the other hand has little to no utility, people don't buy it to enjoy it they just buy hopeful it will be worth more in the future.  But it goes to my point if you argue gold value with a gold bug they will talk about quantity of mining being down adoption of India an China as jewelry as they move into middle class etc.  Bitcoin, your an idiot you just don't understand the technology.
I watched the video I just don't agree that Bitcoin is a reliable store of value. For one thing it swings wildly so would you put 30k you made in it if you needed that 30k for an operation for your kid next year.  Sure it could be worth 90k but it could also be worth, but could just as easily be worth 9k.
Bitcoin only went up in value because people thought it would continue to go up in value so they were willing to pay more and more for it.  Can you make a lot of money trading bitcoin sure, but you can also make a lot of money buying a lottery ticket, but it doesn't make for a good longterm investment.

Probably not because the hype is gone.  But markets can stay irrational for long periods of time especially when there is heavy speculation in those markets.  But eventually market forces set rational prices of assets.  A rational price is how many hours of our labor we are willing to trade for something that gives us utility or enjoyment.  My argument is Bitcoin is pure speculation and at some point individual investors will realize Bitcoin has no real utility thus they won't be willing to trade their labor to acquire it.  They will trade their labor for something that they can use or enjoy.  Right now the vast majority of buyers are just buying hoping it goes up.  If it doesn't eventually they will sell to acquire something of value.

FYI Value Investing is a term either coined or at least popularized by Benjamin Graham who was Warren Buffets mentor.  Value investing refers to say in a certain industry business that make 100k an year usually would sell for 1 million or 10% return, but you find one that you can buy for 600k thus getting you a 17% return that’s value investing because when market corrects the business will be worth 1 million making you 400k gain.  
But it’s all based on a business income, Bitcoin produces no income so value investing would not apply.  Funny, just look up what Warren Buffet has said about Bitcoin, and you will quickly learn why he is the worlds greatest investor.
