Any extra security you could use is definitely a plus. That being said, i dont know much about veracrypt tbh. That might be overkill, but I'll defer to someone else's opinion here. I'd just start by saving the wallet to a flash drive, or getting some dedicated hardware.
Were you planning on using it as a primary or savings wallet?

Will the Bitcoin Lightning Network offer any benefit to those of us who host a full node?  
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:56:46
Are there any updates in the works that should make the transaction fees lower and easier to process?  
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:05:19
Isn't that more along the lines of tipping people who have the entire blockchain on their PC?  Is there an estimated rollout date for Lightning Network?

I wish I didn't sell when I did.  I bought 2 over the course of a few months at right around $100.  I sold at $400.  Now, that being said, as broke as I am, it's really difficult emotionally do deal with the fact that had I not sold when I did, that I'd be almost debt free now.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:51:10
Depends on how big the transaction was.  Worst case scenario, it'll get rejected and go back to your wallet.

Yeah that was my thought.  Do you know of any websites/retailers that accept bitcoin and sell games
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:28:53
As someone new to BTC, why is this big?

@_date: 2017-03-25 22:40:01
It's in a way I agree with though.  It allows for simpler transactions and seems like a reasonable upgrade.
@_date: 2016-01-05 04:00:43
Ease of sharing email addresses and people who you were in contact with wouldn't know they were connected to you.
Let's say I have 2 friends, andy and bill. Andy gets one public key, bill another different one. Unless I told them, they wouldn't know they were both doing business with me.

Just bought at 950 yesterday.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:17:54
If you're freaking out about what's going on, all I can say is "Welcome to bitcoin! This happens quite a bit, but hodl and ride it out if you can!"
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:54:46
I mainly did it because I believe in the system the way it's set up. Segwit is logical next step, and I think that eventually everyone will come to that conclusion.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:10:03


Bought at $950

Basically, scan a QR code and it sends an email to the recipient's private email address.  You could set up multiple QR codes for different people.

@_date: 2019-11-29 00:57:45
One of Bitcoin's biggest benefits is that it doesn't care who or what you are.  It doesn't care about your address, credit score, how wealthy you are... it cares that you have a number only you can access.  That's what makes it so special for third world countries.
@_date: 2019-11-29 00:48:06
Worth noting though, I tried to use it with them a few years back.  There was a HDD that I wanted to buy, and I paid in BTC.  They canceled the order and stated that the price was an error and they would be returning the funds.  When I called customer service, they kept saying that "My card was never charged."  We went back and forth for a while, and even got a supervisor involved who mirrored his same responses.
I hope they at least have someone on payroll now that understands how BTC works, but it ended up in me losing money because all they would do is give me a "store credit" for what I sent them.

Then support the Lightning Network.  It incentives hosting nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:37:40
Just did that an hour ago. 12 connections now lol
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:04:20
I have, been waiting a week for a response
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:23:12
It doesn't really quite work that way, but it's simple enough to do.  What OS do you run?  If you have windows, it's as simple as downloading a program, running it, and letting it do the rest by itself.  Literally.
Linux and Mac get a bit more "command prompt" intensive, but it's still not terrible.  Send me a message if you want and I'd be happy to help you set one up :D
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:56:49
You can run a node of a raspberry pi as well!  Just need an old external hard drive, a micro sd card, a phone charger (mini USB i believe) and a raspberry pi.
Once Lightning kicks in, you'll thank me.  Plus, you're supporting a great community.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:19:56
You basically become part of the bank.  You keep and broadcast your copy of the ledger (the imaginary book of all transactions that have occurred).  It strengthens the system by spreading the ledger over many many computers.  So if one gets compromised, or a country gets compromised somehow, the system will tend to correct itself over time.  Without getting too detailed, the more people that have ledger, the harder it is to make a fake one.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:16:21
Just adds more power to the chain :D
There are youtube videos out there that instruct you on how to make one with a Raspberry Pi if that's what you're going for.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:23:47
Shouldn't take that long... I have 15 down and it took 2-3 days.  Make sure your PC is getting priority network bandwidth.

We have some cleaners where we work that emigrated from Mexico to work in the US.  They often send money via MoneyGram back home to their families, which of course costs them an arm and a leg.  I told them about bitcoin about a year ago, maybe not that long, and about the (at the time) low transfer fees.  They loved the idea and apparently, in or near where their families live, they can convert it into their local currency or exchange it for goods or something (language barrier).  So I was able to help them save money and transfer money to their family and keep a very good paper trail.  At one point they even asked if they could get a percentage of their paycheck in BTC, but that wasn't an option.
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:21:42
I'm expecting it to drop down to 600-700, then stabilize around 900.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:21:06
It helps the system.  When Lightning Network becomes a thing, you'll basically start getting "tips" for hosting the blockchain.  
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:37:58
I can't get more than 8 connections.  I remember back in the day it wasn't uncommon to have 25+.  What can I do to connect to more nodes?
@_date: 2016-12-26 00:08:08
Every time it gets to the front page, that bitcoin chalkboard series should be stickied. Keep people educated and safe.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:55:36
That's still a pretty small amount, it may take a while.  Until Lightning Network goes through, smaller transactions are kind of hard to come by.
@_date: 2016-11-08 04:41:56
Although I don't think (or hope) he's going to win, at least I'll get $7 out of the deal

Does anyone know the current size of a full node? Wanting to use a raspberry pi as one.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:55:10
It's just quicker to copy and past a prompt than go through all these other things.  
With Windows, it couldn't be easier.
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:30:13
Also, have your own wallet. Don't let coinbase or circle hold it for you. Print off your own wallet and use that instead.
@_date: 2015-08-29 16:49:55
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:28:44
We said that when it was at $300 each. We have no idea where this is going so any little bit helps, plus it's enough to learn the system and learn about wallets

Congrats!  I'm already kicking myself in the ass for selling 2 BTC at $400, but I needed the money and only spent like $175 on it, so I came out good.
Still have 0.2 left, hoping it'll someday be enough to pay off a house, but mainly sticking around for the ride.  Best of luck everyone, we'll all reach our moon some day!

Banker here. Making smaller deposits is illegal (structuring) and anything over 10k cash is reported to the IRS via a form the teller is required to fill out. They won't tell you about it and will probably do it after you leave.
BTC might be one way to do it, or you could just say you sold a boat or something. That's what most people do.

Welcome to the roller coaster ride that is bitcoin. It may go way up, it may go way down. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
Wallets are free to make and there are plenty of faucets online that you can use to get your first free satoshi  (smallest unit of a bitcoin). I like  (non referral link), as it's been around for a while.
You don't need to be a programmer to get into it, just be knowledgeable of what's happening in the community. 
Bitcoin is only as safe as you make it, so watch online videos about keeping your private key safe.

You could exchange it for cash with LBC, sell on Coinbase, or buy goods with it.  Use it to buy gold, vehicles (some car places accept it as a form of payment but you really gotta look), or donate to charity!

Banker here to clear a few things up that I'm reading.
People under 18 can own accounts (as long as a parent is Co owner) and you can get a student debit card (lower limits).
My concern with giving a minor btc is that the things teenagers use it for (food, gas, video games) don't really quite accept btc yet. At least not where I live. 
Most of my btc is unfortunately stuck where it is for a while until kansas city gets its head out out of its ass and evolves.

Long time hodler here.  I cashed out a bit when it was at $2600 a month or so ago, but that's just due to my own financial difficulties, but I'm still hodling the rest and continuing to buy.  I don't see this as a dip, I see it as a fire sale.
