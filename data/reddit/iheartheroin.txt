It's been over 4 days and I haven't received my money. I had it sent to Bitcoin-24 but the site went down not too long after I completed my order. Not sure where my money is at the moment. Sent a support email to Bitinstant 3 days ago and I've gotten no reply. -_-

Yes, I have all the information provided by Bitinstant for my order.

A few days ago, pretty sure it was on Monday, I was on Coinbase and was going to make a purchase. That was until I saw a notification on the site saying that due to an unusually high amount of transactions, any bitcoin transactions would be held until Friday the 19th (today) and completed for the price today. I held off on it, because I figured I didn't want to wait 4 days with a transaction pending, not knowing how the market would fluctuate. However, the day (Tuesday) or possibly Wednesday, I went onto the Coinbase site and the previous notification I'm talking about was not there, so I made an order for 0.3 BTC. After I completed the order, the transaction showed up as +0.3 BTC Pending. I was notified that my transaction will be completed and the BTC will arrive in my account on this coming Monday. Not sure if this relates to your problem, but it's some information that might be helpful.

After a week of my order for 0.3 BTC pending, they canceled it on the day of when it was supposed to be completed (today). I received the "we cancelled your order because of high-risk" bullshit message. Woopty do.
