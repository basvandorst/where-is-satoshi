Don’t forget to write down the seed tasted like in 20 words

Shaky argument on the energy piece imo.  Without getting into that I’d like to focus on perceived weaknesses of POS.  
What do you mean it promotes hoarding wealth??  Haven’t seen a thoughtful takedown of POS actual flaws.  Would love to see.

Thanks I’ll have to read up on betterhash

It doesn’t waste energy, doesn’t have the same 51% attack vector as POW

Curious to know what do you see as the fail points of POS?
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:50:54
You said POS is inferior.  Please just list those properties you reference and how they make it weak.

Didn’t want to get sidetracked on the creative philosophy that justifies the enormous energy consumption of POW.  
Not all POS systems pay rewards.  So again what are its weaknesses as a protocol?

But what about the economies of scale?  We see industrial level mining of bitcoin for a reason.  That reduces the bulk of the mining power to what amounts to as a cartel.  They can easily collude.

So you have nothing.  Got it.

How is that limiting?  That would cause more geographic centralization and likely collaboration with their neighbors operating in the same vicinity, not to mention heighten vulnerability to a particular legal jurisdiction.
