There are quite a few more choices than that. It really all depends on [location](

How would sitting in a room with someone make you privy to their financial dealings?

cheap &amp; fast transactions when demand is for 4-12tps
@_date: 2015-08-20 20:38:46
That's a different issue. In theory that could trigger a fork with 0% actual xt miners, which is why its pretty dumb software. Actual miners have no incentive to run it either, only nodes.

That's not censorship. You can still gain access to all the information by scrolling down, unlike with actual censorship.

Its not a dictatorship if people can freely opt out. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:32:35


It can't because it has to maintain the 75% for a two week rolling average which has ~0% probability with only 50% hash power. With around 72% hash power maybe we could get a fork.

Their block increases they are on board with are far too small, their proposals are more like lip-service to get people off their backs.


You cant be a true dictator of open source software because of the opportunity to fork. Like we are seeing right now.

How does it give control to Mike? It's just another implementation that can be forked from just like core. 


Why would they rush to, they have until 2016.

Bitcoins ability to be used as a store of value is contingent on it having value, which is contingent on demand meeting supply. Less demand means it is a worse store of value

He's right because an open source authoritarian is only an authoritarian over their implementation. The choice, and therefore the power is with the users. It would be better to have 5 different leaders leading 5 different implementations of bitcoin where the userbase forms consensus fluidly, than one version where 5 people have to come to consensus to make any significant updates. The former creates an environment that applies a competitive pressure on the system that forces evolution, the latter creates gridlock in the process, like we have now.

There doesn't need to be any extra use case. In a market with 12tps demand and 3tps capability around 30,000 extra transactions go unconfirmed per hour. ~750,000 unconfirmed transactions by the end of the first day, with the same added each day.

No, it makes no difference so there is little impetus. Earliest is 2016 so can wait for conferences etc. If blocks start getting full/fees rise then people will move to xt in big numbers.


I think people care about usability more than mining centralization risk so i think its inevitable unless core goes with big blocks.
@_date: 2015-08-23 13:49:28
Even if it doesn't die, Bitcoin is whatever the majority say it is. Altcoins are cryptos that aren't Bitcoin. If 75% run xt, that implementation becomes the bitcoin reference client. Core would become an alt-client until it either regains the majority or changes implementation to rejoin consensus.

The opposite is true too though. Well engineered products that are superior to the competition have failed because they didn't understand the market and were mismanaged
@_date: 2015-08-23 13:44:42
Which is all determined by which software the majority decides to run.
@_date: 2015-08-20 03:08:03
I think the average bitcoin user can come to the conclusion that longer wait times for transactions and higher fees aren't good, they didn't need Gavin to garner their favor.

An only big blocks XT version is available

How does he represent any danger whatsoever considering bitcoin is open source? If he moves in a direction people don't like they don't follow.
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:37:46
The price tends to move on headlines rather that technicalities. The headlines are "bitcoin could split" so I imagine a few people selling off from fear or anticipating fear and moving first.
