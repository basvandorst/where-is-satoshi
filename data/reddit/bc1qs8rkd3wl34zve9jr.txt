adoption leads to price increase, which leads to expensive bitcoin, who wants that? :P

how do i feel comfortable upgrading when it seems easy to deploy a client that could contain malware or bad code? if u just say it's an emergency and bam everyone listens and upgrades? how do u prove it, how do i make sure myself, i can't read code, how do i know if they are trying to sabotage the system?

is the snack machine scenario null because of replace by fee? can't just trust the first transaction until the block is made anymore?

what does he mean by "cranking out millions of coins per day" ? 
“No matter what the price of Bitcoin, you cannot lose money by mining Bitcoin. Let’s say the price drops to $2000, everybody gets out, and the difficulty rate drops to zero, and you’re cranking out millions of coins per day.”
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:48:50
if mining reward is currently 12.5 btc per 10 min how does that equal millions of coins per day? also difficulty always matches what is on the network so it never goes to 0. maybe he meant usd$ as 144 blocks a day at $2000 is $3.6million

@_date: 2018-08-04 01:15:12
it's more about keeping the value in the system versus converting to fiat and the rollercoaster that is trading
@_date: 2018-08-27 07:55:00
you need buyers, when someone sees you trying to sell a shit ton for a certain price they lower their price they want to buy it at cause they know you need to get rid of them, so you lower price to sell, so they lower price to buy etc etc

looks like the first loss went to bc1q6p58amfp0e3ppgy99qx9x9tcm00e6j8fqkdjcs and teh second to 3QUCC5QsBXG6uLLtsLM5Zfa5LRSu8bEtJ4

@_date: 2018-08-26 23:02:05
the idea is to keep the blocks small so that anyone can be a node and verify for themselves even with crappy internet and old pc, if the poor can not participate, it is not revolutionary. bch will create large blocks that require huge storage and fast internet which will really cut out a ton of people able to verify for themselves and rely on other centralized entities to do it for them, which is against the whole idea imo.

it syncs from the first block ever until your transaction, let it finish
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:54:17
the whole idea is to download and verify it yourself lel

are the miners decentralized? 
@_date: 2018-05-30 10:52:41
If all transactions using Bitcoin were on the blockchain, to enable
7 billion people to make two transactions per day, it would require 24GB
blocks every ten minutes at best (presuming 250 bytes per transaction and
144 blocks per day). Conducting all global payment transactions on the
blockchain today implies miners will need to do an incredible amount of
computation, severely limiting bitcoin scalability and full nodes to a few
centralized processors.
If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of
micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per
year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node
with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage.

@_date: 2018-11-13 05:14:11


didn't this have to do with unconfirmed transactions and the vending machine scenario, and no longer valid cause of replace by fee? i dont see the point of using this quote on bitcoin as a whole?

the reward goes down as more miners get on board and the value of the amount you mine is related to the current price, this is just so dumb, and their are asics for most vid card algos now anyway lol

up or down, who'da thunkit
@_date: 2018-12-22 06:09:32
i think this means the updates are manual and not automatic, meaning you have to choose to update to the new change, a full node just checks your own copy of the blockchain to make sure the shit you send/received is correct
@_date: 2018-12-30 21:29:57
