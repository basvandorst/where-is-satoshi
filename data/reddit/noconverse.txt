Seriously, just give this a day or two to settle, money not earned is not the same as money lost.

I fully agree. Nothing has its value rise by 10% in 24 hours for sound reasons. This is a classic speculation bubble.

FFS, the reason is speculation. When you see something as highly valued as BTC change in value by 10 or 15% over the course of a few hours without some obvious explanation, that's classic speculation behavior. People are seeing the wild fluctuations in price and thinking this is their chance to make some easy money. At the same time, you have an equally large group of people that did the same earlier and are now panic selling. These two groups of people interact, counteract, and reinforce each other in wildly unpredictable ways and the result is what we're seeing now.
There is a large group of people who are simply using it as their currency of choice that act as BTCs base, but right now it's the speculators that are controlling the price.

Sure, a huge crisis event can cause something like that, but AFAIK nothing like that has happened. India and Venezuela are still at the about the same level of shit today that they were three days ago, but the price has skyrocketed and now it looks to be tumbling, so again, this all points to a speculation bubble.

I'm not gonna disagree that bitcoin prices have risen because many more people are starting to adopt it as a form of currency, that's what caused its price to more than double over the past year, but there's no way that so many people are adopting it that it caused the price to rise more than US$100/btc in a single day. 
What's happening here is that just as many people are seeing it's dramatic price rise and thinking this a chance to make some easy money, so they're pumping cash into it, hoping they can cash out before the price drops, just like with any speculation bubble.
