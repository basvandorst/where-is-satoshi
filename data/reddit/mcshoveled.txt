I don't follow your point on Gonzales V. Raich, can you elaborate or provide sources? All I've seen is related specifically to the case for/against marijuana and not how it might change the enforcement of other controlled substances.

There you go putting words in my mouth again. I did not say "don't fight against the law" that is freedom of speech and our right to protest. 
You want to break the law to cause change then you are asking for trouble. Expect to be jailed, fined whatever. You decided to break the law. 
Laws are there for the protection of the society as a whole. If you say "break the laws you don't like" then there is no law. Simply put someone will decide they don't like the law about not stealing and rob from you. Maybe someone decides they don't like not being able to drive drunk so they do and they kill a member of your family?
However little you personally like a particular law does not give you the right to ignore it. Not until we, as a society, agree that the law is stupid and have it removed.

Was just making a point that I'm not a Jeff Sessions. Thought that was relevant.

Lol, I speed :P
I always wanted to be chaotic neutral, just can't really pull it off. Too much of a nerd tbh.

Basically don't be a criminal and respect the law and it's enforcement officers. 
Clearly he was made an example of. Good. He can rot in there so that we have fewer people that want to take his place. The alternative is living in a country run by drug cartels. No thanks. 
Before you down vote me to oblivion, I do believe we should legalize marijuana. I just don't believe that allowing people to willfully break the law for personal profit will build a viable society.

Yeah, of course I am a hypocrite [serious]. We all are to some extent or another. None of us have learned how to remove the plank from our own eye before trying to remove the spec in someone else's eye. (is that how that goes?)
I am sure we all break some laws now and then, and we all pay the price if/when we get caught. I *try* to be a good member of society, I try not to harm those around me. I don't always succeed.

Yep, missed that :(

Right, so legally I can concede that making an exception for California's medical marijuana law would have potentially brought the entire controlled substance act into legal jeopardy and would effectively allow any state to essentially override the federal law. 
Still removing marijuana from the list of controlled substances should allow states to then pass their own laws regarding its legality without jeopardizing the federal law.

"Your reasoning implies that without dark markets the world would be free of drugs."
The world will never be free of drugs, guns, or violence. That doesn't mean we should give up and go full anarchy. 
"Taking pushers away from the streets, clients outside dangerous encounters and exchanges..."
I've seen this argument before on this thread. I've honestly never given much thought to making crime safer.

Lol, don't get me started on *that* criminal. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:02:25
Well, as I said it is clear he was made an example. There is a long history in our legal system of doing this both in civil and criminal cases. The most common case used for an example was Liebeck v. McDonald's in 1994. You don't believe 2.8 million dollars was a just judgment for a single cup of hot coffee?

Insightful and well articulated, thanks for sharing your opinion. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:42:12
You are misunderstanding the basis of your own argument. Calling me a dumbass doesn't fix your own lack of comprehension.
Have a nice life.

"Drug buyers are going to buy drugs either way."
That is the same B.S. they feed us about gun control. Thing is there are real world examples to the contrary. Reducing supply does reduce users. 
As to cartels not dealing on darknets, you might be right *currently*; however, that has nothing to do with what I said. I said allowing people to willfully break the law for profit is a problem. 
Regardless, he is doing time for more than just "running a website" as is claimed by the OP, can we agree on that at least?
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:42:44
No. Marijuana is illegal, so I don't use. I didn't say I use it. 
I'm in support of it becoming legal. If it does, maybe I'll use, maybe I won't. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:21:13
You don't really think that do you?
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:13:21
We really don't know how that ended, it was settled out of court iirc?
