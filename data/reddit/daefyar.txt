@_date: 2019-06-22 00:24:39
im considering playing it a bit.  Violent spikes like this usually drop a bit before climbing back up again. might be ablke to get a little more.
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:52:23
Why even ask. Noone knows.
@_date: 2019-06-23 01:29:51
seems legit.  This is now my gospel.
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:01:09
Oh I'm not doubting that. But I'm just hoping you are being responsible with your fiat and not living it paycheck to paycheck. You still need your emergency fund and all
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:21:25
Lol wtf
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:25:04

@_date: 2019-05-17 14:53:16
You see. I know you are right. Yet that Hellcat is screaming my name.
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:17:33
Lol.  Das cool
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:31:44

@_date: 2019-05-19 06:35:16
A wet fart tho. That's what really causes those big crashes.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:20:13

@_date: 2019-05-19 06:34:19

@_date: 2019-05-19 06:13:48

@_date: 2019-05-20 00:12:35

@_date: 2019-05-19 03:18:45
Well I hope you are right!  Cheers!
@_date: 2019-05-19 06:15:16
