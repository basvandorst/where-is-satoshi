Hey, thanks! No of course not. I will have a proper savings account in the bank for him but this as a little side project could be a bit of fun for me, play around with a little bit, nothing major that I'm going to kick myself over if it doesn't pan out.
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:06:44
Ah yeah, basically grinding?
@_date: 2014-09-14 00:19:17
I dunno. I guess so
@_date: 2014-09-13 11:49:58
haha, I would pref more bitcoins, not worried about cashing out on it
@_date: 2014-09-11 12:16:55
Depends how much Bitcoin you're getting for them, tbh.

Thanks man, appreciated!
@_date: 2014-09-14 08:14:21
Yeah but I also know how stupid police are. I just don't see the point in complaining about something we can't change lol.

It took me about a day to figure out wtf was going on and what it really is, its pretty awesome that I have my own online currency now, even though i might have bugger all, it's impressive. It's the future.

Thanks man, appreciate it.

Yeah, I have a son on the way so I am going to slowly accumulate bitcoin until he is old enough to use it and understand it. Who knows, it could pay for his college education someday. 
Edit- If anyone has any advice on this matter. I'm all ears.

Thanks bro!

I have like, 15 usd in bitcoins. How do I turn this into 20 usd?
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:55:25
I wish but I really don't have much useful skills, sadly. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:40:23
And how much have you bought in so far? And what have you gained?
@_date: 2014-09-14 05:01:27
Seizing is not impounding or destroying, he will get it back. The police were dealing with something they know nothing of. 
If all signs pointed to a grow op and then some guy who has some weed on him and may have been stoned starts rambling on about internet money and bitcoins....? C'mon man...
@_date: 2014-09-14 00:20:05
Yeah nah, I'm not keen on a conviction. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 04:15:49
I mean, he still had some weed on him. He should've thought things through before he decided to pump that much electricity as those are signs police look for. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 06:01:43
Right...
