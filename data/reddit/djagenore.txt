XRP represent a join-point between crypto and standard economy. Maybe is shining for this, and probably can take a hit to BTC.
That's my concern. Also because BTC is suffering lack if Tech Advancementes, Scalability, Multiple Forks that "inflate" che supply Cap ...

AFAIK Ripple is not "infinite" but has an abundant supplu (1 Kilo Billion maybe?) So it will become somehow "finite" and "scarce", if it goes mainstream.

It's doable, for sure in Stock Exchange.
Imho the problem is that while is easy to prove the gain (withdraw - bought) is not easy to prove the loss since you can "hide" some coins to enfake the calculation.
Theorically it can be done.

Vitras this is what I'm looking for, if I've understood well.
Sorry if I do dumb question...
A Key Generator (for example, Electrum is a Keygen?) create a public key (123456) and a private key (abcdef).
I send my BTC to 123456 and I can share 123456 address to anyone who want to send me btc.
Private key abcdef will be kept secretly somewhere, and I don't need PC, usb keys, Backup, all... since at the end, BTCs stays on the BlockChain and are not physically in my PC or elsewhere.
I just have to store this Key, that will work like "A ring to Rule them all", no matter what. 
Am I correct? There is something I'm missing?
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:09:50
Thx for the Kind reply.
Can you then suggest me a good desktop wallet for BTC (I've read Electrum) and one for ETH (don't know anyone)?
Also, considering a 10yrs sleeping BTC with no transaction, is a good idea to store in an offline pc + backups or also only USB keys are ok?
Lastly, how does it works the "paper" bitcoin? Is a secure way to store?
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:05:52
how? via the Seed generated by the first?

Being me a Long-Term Holder and not a trader (also because I'm in Pending Verification since a week in 4 exchanges...) I think the best option should be to create a pair of keys (Pub &amp; Pri) via bitaddress in an airgapped pc, and perform in the same way the signed transaction.
Then store the Priv Key in any possible secure way.
On the other hand, I can leave my BTC in on CoinBase or any other site that perform cold storage / vaulting ... hoping they don't fail / scam ...

Great Replies!
I've read point 4 more and more times to understand it, and -correct me in case- I've understood that BitCoins and their values stay on the BlockChain itself, and keys identifies the one who has the right to use that value.
So I can just print the private key and have the right on my BTC, no matter what. Yes?
Dumb example:
I install Electrum, got a BTC address, send to it my BTC from my online wallet. From now on, those BTC are on my direct command.
I print the private key, suppose "123456abcdef", then I got the PC with Electrum destroyed and all backup with it.
I buy a new pc, I install electrum -or any other BTC wallet-, setup it, put the private key and... I got access to my BTC.
ps: the private key is something eventually writable or is a extremely long string?

No idea about how works paper bitcoin.
What will be written on the papers?
and how to ... "reconvert" to digital?
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:27:33
Thanks for the explaination.
But... do I "HAVE TO" import the Public Key?
Suppose I Download Bitaddress and place it in an offline machine. Then generate Public and Private.
Can I directly send from Coinbase/Kraken/any the BTC to that public key or the public key MUST be "seen" by the blockchain via importing it in a wallet that goes on internet?
And linked as above, can I send the BTC to that public key that is still unseen by online wallet and import it later in years or BTC will go "lost" since the BlockChain can't see that address?

I fear Hard Wallet... is an item, it can breaks or fault... no?
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:24:57
Is mandatory to use a Printer? Can't be simply hand written?
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:18:11
about point 4:
Isn't hardware wallet "unsure"? Can get physical fault, software failure... does it also need a maintenance like be turned on sometimes?
About Cold Storage I've read a nice guide. Online PC, Offline PC, some USB keys...
Is Paper Bitcoin a viable form of storage?

With the private key you can revive a desktop wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:12:40
Ok got your point... I won't be provocatory but I can go to  , swirl the mouse and generate a pair (or more pair) of Public/Private.
Of course if my PC is under sniffing,or the site, or the printer I'll use for printing the page, well I'm done.
I can collect/store BTC having them going in the public address, and keep safe the private key and use it when I'm in need of spend / change my BTC (by the way, how? how I use concretely the private key if I want to send BTC to let's say Kraken.com next year?)

Since I live in Italy I need a site where one day I can switch BTC/ETH with Eur.

Are you talking by direct happenings or just invoking myths &amp; legends?
Ps: I'm an Euro Bank Teller, I sent to CoinBase funds for me and other ppls, since I know customers that trades in BTC and so on.
Afaik BTC is legal in many countries, and as long you don't move many thousands €/$/£ in and out, the bank (expecially if Big) won't notice or care about it.
Then put your gains in yearly taxes duties and you're ok.

A friend told me to opt toward the greenaddress.com service. Is that a good one?
