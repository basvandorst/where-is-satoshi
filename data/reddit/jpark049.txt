Definitely not in SF lol. Actually not in the country either.

"tyranny: cruel and oppressive government or rule."
It wouldn't be r/bitcoin if the top comment wasn't greatly exaggerated.

Can we stop upvoting this speculative BS? No one knows where the price is going. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:15:37


Lol. Yes, we are a homogeneous blob with a single opinion.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:22:04
God damnit.

Am I missing something? I know you're not submitting their actual site, but why Facebook homepage? lol

I'm not donating 400 dollars to something I haven't even tested lol. Not to mention they're using Android and can virtually test devices quite easily.

Obviously English isn't his/her first language.

It looks like a cool project. If they had it for Nexus 5 I'd try it and consider donating.

I was actually incorrect: rooting does not void the warranty. Unlocking the bootloader does. I usually do both so I lumped their consequences together by accident.

I've returned a rooted phone to Google before and got a replacement.

Countries that do that have much better healthcare than the U.S., which is quite behind for the amount of money spent.

I can raise awareness via sharing etc., but hopefully there is something we can actually help with. PM or reply if you can think of anything!

I couldn't find any evidence saying it's compulsory, but stating such is hardly anti-semitic.

Been using Honey for over a year and it's a very convenient extension! Beats having to search through ad filled sites for codes. Good luck with this!

I've seen a handful of people that say something along the line of "Bitcoin is stupid and everyone here is as well" on every post and post exclusively in this sub.
I actually argued with one until he ended up sending me a message that said "Haha good argument. It was fun pissing you off." I'd wager that most of the alleged "shills" are trolls who know it's easy to piss off people who feel strongly about the future of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:46:18
Holy shit! How do such ignorant posts get upvoted!? You just assumed Americans and people who use bitcoin are oblivious and detached from reality. Idk if this sub is even worth coming to anymore. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:42:33
Dude... how did you get upvoted? Observing climate trends is much different than predicting weather, which is geographically pinpointed when compared to the climate of the entire world. The decision among scientists is almost unanimous that climate change exists. Universal healthcare is very effective in nations that have adopted it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:55:44
Obtuse platitude is meaningless. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:29:19
It uses PayPal and Credit/Debit. It's a cool service but doesn't have all the qualities of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:38:16
Some people can't afford that.
@_date: 2013-12-31 07:55:28
Sounds like he's lying honestly. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:13:17
I'm just getting linked to my Facebook haha. Not their page. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:47:36
What are you even arguing at this point? No one said "fuck the police" or anything like that. The people arguing against you are being slightly ridiculous too. I see stands all the time so these seem like isolated incidents.
